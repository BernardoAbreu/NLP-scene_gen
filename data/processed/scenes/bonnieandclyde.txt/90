<L>__{exterior roadside. day.}
<A>__{bonnie and clyde get out and walk fifteen feet away from the car. both are irritated and touchy. camera follows them.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{get rid of her.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{can't do that. she's buck's wife.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(snapping her words)}
<D>__{get rid of both of them then.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{why? what's the matter with you anyway?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{she's what's the matter with me, a damn stupid back country hick without a brain in her head.}
<P>__{(contemptuously)}
<D>__{she ain't nothin' but prunes and proverbs.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(really pissed off at bonnie)}
<D>__{what makes you any better? what makes you so damn special? you're just a west dallas waitress who spent half your time pickin' up truck drivers!}
<A>__{this hits home with bonnie. he has said the unforgivable.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(raising her voice)}
<D>__{you talk to me like that! big clyde barrow, just the same as your brother, an ignorant uneducated hillbilly.}
<P>__{(with deadly archness)}
<D>__{only special thing about you is your peculiar ideas about lovemakin' which is no love makin' at all.}
<A>__{clyde stiffens. the two of them stand silent and tense, almost quivering with anger. they have stripped each other raw. clyde turns and looks back at the car. everyone is waiting, watching them. he breathes a deep sigh, like a man counting to 10 to hold his temper.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{look, bonnie }
<A>__{he can't finish. close. bonnie. she drops her head into her hand for a moment, comes up a little more relaxed. she looks at clyde and her eyes reflect the realization of the pain she has inflicted on him. she softens.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{clyde...honey...i didn't mean all that, honey. blame it on all that shootin', i just felt so bad...sure enough...clyde?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{okay...okay, hon...let's get movin'...}
<A>__{he turns and begins walking back to the car. bonnie walks alongside him. on the few steps back, she regains all her dignity and acts aloof from the others waiting for her. she reaches the car. clyde opens her door for her and she gets in like a great lady. he walks around to his side, gets in, and they drive off.}
<B>__{wide shot. exterior car. day.}
<A>__{a very wide shot. we see clyde's car driving along a wooded road. for a moment that is all we see, then we should become aware that far in the distance another car is following clyde's. close. rural mail box. on the opposite side of the road, clyde's car swings across the road and clyde, who is driving, snatches a newspaper which protrudes from the box and hands it into the car. they drive out of the shot. camera holds and soon the following car enters the shot. the man driving is a texas ranger. he drives slowly. he drives out of the shot.}
