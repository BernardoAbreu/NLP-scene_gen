<L>__{interior warehouse day}
<A>__{there is a tremendous crash as logs are dropped near the wood chipper. forklifts move and stack wood. walter stands at the end of a wood chipper, pushing a long piece of wood through. suddenly above the din of machinery there is the sound of raised voices. walter looks across the way to see vicki yelling furiously and smacking a guy around the head with her work gloves. the man cowers, protecting his head from the blows. some other men nearby are doubled over in laughter.}

<D>__{god damn it! pedro! what the fuck do you think you are doing! how would you feel if some fucker did that to your sister?! you wouldn't think it so funny then, would you?!}
<A>__{she backs off out of breath. pedro straightens up, having a very hard time keeping a straight face. the other guys start to applaud. vicki looks around and storms off, kicking a piece of wood into one of the men, hard. she brushes past walter on her way to the exit. he watches after her.}
