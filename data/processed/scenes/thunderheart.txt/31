<L>__{exterior grandpa sam reaches trailer outside settlement day}
<A>__{silent. the unnerving silence of the great plains filled only by flys, big horseflies, buzzing around drying sage that hangs from the rafters of a shade arbor. a goat stands under it, just gazing across the vast spread of grass and dry land where an ancient airstream trailer sits lop sided. sheets are hung as curtains. six old cars two from the early 50'a sit stripped to the hubs on blocks in the overgrown grass. the air is dry and heavy and the only sound is flys. ray swats at them as he steps over a truck seat that lies in the grass, stuffing and springs hanging out. crow horse walk. a few steps ahead, toward the trailer.}

<D>__{good question. hardly sees anybody anymore. hasn't left this place in twenty years. did you bring some tobacco?}

<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{when you go see an elder, you always bring some tobacco as a gift.}
<A>__{ray reaches into his shirt pocket and fishes out a pack of marlboro. crow horse glances at it, and shrug nods. they continue on toward the trailer.}
