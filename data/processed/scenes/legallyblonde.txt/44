<L>__{interior civil procedures class day later}
<A>__{professor elspeth stromwell, a tough as nails grande dame in her 50' s , addresses the class. laptops abound — except for elle, who has a fuzzy pink notebook and a pen with a pink plastic heart on the end.}
<C>__{professor stromwell}
<D>__{a legal education means you will learn to speak in a new language. you will be taught to achieve insight into the world around you, and to sharply question what you know.}
<A>__{everyone soaks this up. including elle.}
<C>__{professor stromwell }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the seat you've picked is yours for the next nine months of your life. enjoy it. and those of you in the front row, beware.}
<A>__{elle, in the front row, between two unshowered braniacs, looks around, panicked. one of the braniacs passes her the seating chart and she has no choice but to sign her name. in the back, arrogant aaron nudges his friend and smiles.}
<C>__{professor stromwell }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{"the law is reason free from passion." does anyone know who spoke those immortal words?}

<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{professor stromwell}
<D>__{would you be willing to stake your life on it?}
<C>__{dorky david}
<D>__{i think so...}
<C>__{professor stromwell}
<D>__{how about —}
<A>__{she spins around, roughly poking another student in the head.}
<C>__{professor stromwell }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{— his life?}
<C>__{dorky david}
<P>__{(scared)}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{professor stromwell}
<D>__{well, i recommend knowing before speaking.. the law leaves much room for interpretation — but very little for self doubt.}
<A>__{as she turns away —}
<C>__{professor stromwell }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and you were right. it was aristotle.}
<A>__{the class half laughs in relief.}
<C>__{professor stromwell }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i assume you've all read pages 1 48 and are now well versed in subject matter jurisdiction.}

<D>__{let's call on someone in the hot zone. elle woods? elle looks up, distressed.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{uh... i wasn't aware that we had an assignment.}
<C>__{professor stromwell}
<P>__{(looking at her chart)}
<D>__{sarah knottingham?}
<A>__{sarah knottingham — a prim and preppy blue blood brunette, dressed in pearls and a sweater set — looks up.}
<C>__{professor stromwell }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{do you think it's acceptable that ms. woods is unprepared?}
<A>__{sarah looks over at elle. elle gives her a mortified smile. sarah turns back to professor stromwell.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{no, i don't.}
<C>__{professor stromwell}
<D>__{would you support my decision to ask her to leave and return to class only when she is prepared?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<A>__{elle can't believe that this girl would betray her. having no choice,, she gathers her purse and goes, completely humiliated. professor stromwell returns to the matter at hand.}
