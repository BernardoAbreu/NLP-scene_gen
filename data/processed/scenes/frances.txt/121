<L>__{interior lincoln dusk day}
<A>__{harry, eyes bleary and shoulders hunched, tries to concentrate on the road ahead. the radio drones quietly, a lazy saxophone ballad. after a while, there's movement in the back seat and frances sits up. she yawns and stretches as harry watches her in the mirror.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{evening, gorgeous.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(yawning)}
<D>__{that sure looks like fun...}
<P>__{(leaning over front seat)}
<D>__{you know how long it's been since i was behind the wheel?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{forget it, frances. you're not driving.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{have i told you how mean you're turning, york?}
<A>__{harry smiles. frances climbs over the seat and starts to fiddle with the radio.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{where are we, mean man?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{couple hours from idaho. we'll cut across to montana. i've got friends there with a ranch.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{i should've known...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{this is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{...take advantage of me.}
<A>__{harry laughs. they pass a poster: "buy war bonds!" frances stares at it.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{i don't think i'd be much good in a war...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{whattaya think you're in now?}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(sleepily)}
<D>__{i don't know. not a war exactly. it's more a... a misapprehension maybe...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{a misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. i wasn't declaring war, harry. i was just saying my prayers.}
<A>__{harry looks at her quizzically.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{who to?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{harry, i have to go home. i have to talk to mama.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{frances, you're fulla drugs. you don't know what you're saying. who do you think put you into meadow wood? your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(sitting up)}
<D>__{no, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah? she's a shark, frances. i'm not taking you there, and that's that!}
<A>__{she rubs his neck and his attitude seems to soften. she looks at him fondly, thoughtfully.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{you know something, harry?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i guess.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. there's only one other thing wrong with you.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{you can't drink.}
