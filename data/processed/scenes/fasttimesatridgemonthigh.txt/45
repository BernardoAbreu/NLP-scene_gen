<A>__{the rat feels the beginnings of cold panic, but barges through nonetheless.}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{yes. i have two questions. i was curious...}
<A>__{his voice becomes a shade deeper. he begins to pull the attitude together.}
<C>__{the rat }
<D>__{what do you do with the jackets people leave here?}
<C>__{stacy}
<P>__{(smiling)}

<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{you keep them.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{we keep them, in case the people come back.}

<C>__{stacy }
<D>__{here they are. you can look through it, if you want.}
<A>__{the rat chuckles to himself, struggling with the attitude.}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{it's cool. it would take too much time to go through all that stuff. i will just pick up a new one.}

<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{what's your other question?}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{my other question is... can i have your phone number so i can ask you out sometime?}

<D>__{do you have a pen? this one's out of ink.}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{oh... yes.}
<A>__{he pulls one out of his jacket pocket, gives it to her. stacy writes her name and phone number on a scrap of paper and gives it to him. the rat looks at the paper.}
<C>__{the rat }
<D>__{stacy. nice to meet you, stacy. my name is mark ratner.}
<A>__{he sticks out his hand, and they shake. we see the rat turn around and walk out of swenson's.}
