<A>__{and we see sam moving across this crowded tarmac. disconnected. a bit frightening. and he's greeted by deng.}
<C>__{deng}
<D>__{welcome back.}

<A>__{and we see sam in a corner, off from the rest of the group. and maybe it's just the lighting in here, but there's a darkness around him literally as if the space surrounding this man is devoid of light. and we see william working his way through the room... refilling cups with hot tea... his particular job here... and he comes up to sam and accidently sloshes some of the tea onto sam's arm and he flinches! burned "damn it!" shoots his arm out and accidentally hits william in the chest knocking him backward onto the ground. the entire room falls silent. nobody moving. and sam gets up and walks out of the room.}
