<A>__{eager to hear what is being said, doug dashes through the living room to the front door.}

<A>__{joan has the driver's door to her station wagon open now. helen is on the sidewalk. her demeanor is measured, purposefully matter of fact.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i don't think that's necessary.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{well, if i were you i would talk to him and tell him...}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(cutting her off)}
<D>__{no, i'm sorry, joan, i will not do that. if you have something to say to my son, then you'll have to say it to him yourself.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i just thought you would like to know what he's done.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{and why on earth should i believe anything you say, joan?}
<A>__{joan is unable to find a quick retort, she gets into her station wagon and drives away. helen notices a baseball lying in the gutter, she picks it up and cleans it off with her apron. as she turns to go back to the house, she finds doug standing on the porch steps. without warning, she expertly pitches the baseball across the yard to doug it makes his hand sting when he catches it. helen walks up to the porch.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i'm going to ask you one question, doug, and if you have no idea, or don't want to answer, just tell me.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{is there any sense, you think, in which jacey has... oh, i don't know, it sounds ridiculous... corrupted eleanor abbott? led her astray?}
<A>__{doug's mind works in several directions at once as he tries to figure out how much he should or could tell her.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{well... jeez... i know that he's... that he's slept with her. but not because he's talked about it. i mean... eleanor has lots of boyfriends. i think jacey likes her more than she likes him.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(long beat)}
<D>__{i see.}
<P>__{(another beat)}
<D>__{go finish your homework.}
<A>__{doug lobs the baseball back to her and goes inside. helen sits on the porch steps and now the true toll that joan's visit has taken on helen becomes apparent a bone weary sadness falls over her. her "tranquility" is not borne of happiness, it is only a means of coping with the sadness that is at the core of her being.}
