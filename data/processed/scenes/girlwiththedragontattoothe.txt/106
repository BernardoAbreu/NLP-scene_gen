<D>__{i forget did i ask you before if you liked anal sex?}
<A>__{he crams a pillow under her stomach and climbs on top of her. she keeps fighting but there's not much she can do handcuffed. eventually, she retreats to another place inside herself. she's had to go here before in her life; it's the only place to go in such situations.}
