<L>__{exterior manzanar internment camp night}
<A>__{...a moonlit desert. pan the barbed wire, the distant barracks, the desolation. come to... ...two women walking alone. the younger one glancing at her mother as they go. fujiko's eyes unreadable, stare implacably ahead. the barracks, everything, in distance behind them.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{you think we're far enough away now?}
<A>__{no sarcasm in the voice. she lets the words carry her irony. her mother stops. looks at her so directly, so strong. even her tough minded daughter flinches slightly.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{mom, whatever this is, they don't keep war secrets this carefully.}
<A>__{fujiko thinks that over. nods.}
<C>__{fujiko}
<D>__{secrets are hard to keep.}
<A>__{she goes over to a large, flat rock. sits down. pulls two sheets of paper from her coat. and waits. as her daughter comes and crouches at her feet. fujiko clears her throat.}
<C>__{fujiko}
<D>__{this letter. was opened. by mistake.}
<A>__{and watches. as the shard of fear penetrates her daughter's mask. silence. then...}
<C>__{fujiko }
<D>__{'my love. i still go to our cedar tree in the afternoons every day. i shut my eyes, waiting.'}
<A>__{hatsue has turned to stone. to ice. wind blows.}
<C>__{fujiko }
<D>__{'i smell your smell. and i dream of you. and i ache for you to come home. so i can hold you and feel you near.'}
<A>__{fujiko scans the page silently. turns to the second...}
<C>__{fujiko }
<D>__{'after all these years that we've been together, i find you're a part of me. without you, i have nothing. all my love, forever...'}
<A>__{and looks up. her eyes calm, quiet.}
<C>__{fujiko}
<D>__{the neighborhood boy. who taught you to swim?}
<A>__{the look holds. and holds.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{you shouldn't have opened that. it was mi...}
<C>__{fujiko }
<D>__{how deceitful of me.}
<A>__{anger only at the edges. like finely honed steel.}
<C>__{fujiko}
<D>__{how can i ever hope. for your forgiveness.}
<A>__{the wind swirls a cloud of dust between them. they seem not to notice.}
<C>__{fujiko}
<D>__{i have written this letter to the boy's parents...}
<A>__{she pulls out a single page. hands it down to her daughter. hatsue's eyes move quickly over the words.}
<C>__{fujiko}
<D>__{attraction is no crime, certainly among children. the dishonor lies in the concealment. from your families.}
<A>__{watches her daughter reading. and quietly...}
<C>__{fujiko}
<D>__{i know that you know this. i know you have suffered. even if the hakujin could not.}
<A>__{silence. hatsue's eyes cast down. she folds the page.}
<C>__{fujiko}
<D>__{there will be no further letters. no contact of any k...}
<A>__{and stops. because hatsue is tearing the page in two. she looks up. into her mother's shock.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{one more letter. i will write it. you may read it, and send it for me.}
<A>__{her mother's anger fades. into interest.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{i deceived more than you. i deceived this sweet boy. and myself. it was never love.}
<A>__{never love. the mother's face changes. there is understanding, acceptance. even pride.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{i will work hard. to earn your forgiveness.}
<A>__{a sigh. a sadness deep, beyond her years.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{i can never hope for his.}
