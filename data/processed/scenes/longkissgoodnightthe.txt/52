<T>__{dissolves to:}
<A>__{establishing salt & pepper lounge morning a gunmetal grey sky looms overhead. the aforementioned lounge is a faded old roadhouse, gravel parking lot strewn with mud covered trucks. the kind that get a man laid in these parts. henessey's plymouth pulls into the lot, rolls to a halt. he'll never get any.}
<L>__{interior salt & pepper lounge day}
<A>__{honky tonk. samantha and henessey enter, blinking in the dimness. around them, drunk mid day cowboys. stringy haired girls in their ample laps. samantha consults her watch:}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{quarter til. any time now.}
<A>__{they sit at the counter. henessey flags the bartender. signals for a beer. lights a cigarette, blows smoke:}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{nice crowd.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{you're just jealous of their girlfriends.}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{who wouldn't be? corner booth, there's a beaut. while you're doing her doggie style you can pop the zits on her back.}
<A>__{samantha shoots him a look. on a tv above the bar, a british sounding cnn announcer is saying:}
<C>__{cnn commentator }
<D>__{violence in northern ireland continues today, despite a plea by british prime minister john major }
<A>__{samantha sits up straight. draws a sharp breath. he shoots her a questioning look }
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{i just... got a flash of something, i...}
<P>__{(blinks)}
<D>__{i hurt my father.}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{whoa. you remember your father?}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{no... that's what's strange.}
<P>__{(shakes her head)}
<D>__{if i saw him on the street, i... i wouldn't... oh.}
<A>__{she rubs her eyes. her voice breaks. she's utterly miserable. henessey leans in, says softly:}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{ms. caine, last week at a party i ran into a girl i knew from college and we chatted for a few minutes. and it wasn't til i was driving home on the freeway that i remembered that i'd screwed her in the back of a car once.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{everyone forgets.}
<A>__{he pats her arm. smiles reassuringly. a pause. she stares.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{that's it? that's your helpful story? jesus christ!}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{no, see, all's i'm saying is you're not alone.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{oh, shut up.}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{fine. i gotta use the head.}
<A>__{he stands, heads off. samantha nervously lights a cigarette. the bartender suddenly puts a beer in front of her. she reaches for her purse. he waves it away, points beside her. she turns... the assassin called timothy sits down two stools away.}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{for you. another in a long line of bad investments.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{just saw the ring on your finger.}
<A>__{he reveals a surprisingly winning smile, says:}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{do i know you from somewhere...?}
<A>__{grimaces:}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{whoa. back up. total pickup line, let's forget i said that.}
<A>__{still staring in her eyes. noting absolutely no recognition on her features. she gives him a cursory smile.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{thanks for the drink. but no. i don't know you.}
<A>__{timothy nods slowly.}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{no, you don't, do you...? i'd know if you did. i can tell if someone's lying.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{sorry to bother you.}
<A>__{he takes his own drink and crosses to a back booth. sits, a very puzzled look on his face. adjusts his coat collar, whispers into a concealed transmitter:}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{okay, people, i got what i needed. wait until she comes out. then do them both.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{walk soft, we got local law.}
<A>__{he sits back as two sheriff's deputies suddenly enter, doffing their stetsons. cross to the bar. henessey, coming out of the bathroom. sees the deputies. grabs samantha by the elbow. tosses down a fin, steers her toward the door.}
<C>__{samantha}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{pork. on your nine.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{so you shot a guy in the head yesterday. we wait outside.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{it's freezing.}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{too bad. people shouldn't shoot other people in the head. just themselves. during that show with the little girl who's a robot.}
