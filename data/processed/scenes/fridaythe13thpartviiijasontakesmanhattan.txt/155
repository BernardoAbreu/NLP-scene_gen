<L>__{exterior alley #1 night (long lens)}
<A>__{as julius runs into view, looking down a menacing alley, spotting a phone booth. he hurries for it. predator's point of view like a cat watching a bird, we watch julius head for the booth.}
<B>__{julius}
<A>__{slams open the booth door, grabbing the receiver, punching the "operator" digit. slowly push in on him as he waits for an answer. several more rings.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{c'mon...}
<A>__{finally a click and muffled words from the operator.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{get me the police this is an emergency...}
<A>__{smash! as jason's fist crashes through the booth window, grabbing julius by the throat. julius grips jason's scaly arm with all his strength, staring at the cracked hockey mask framed in the shattered window. julius summons all his strength, tearing free of jason's grasp and running out the door. the phone is left dangling. running with julius (hand held) with no apparent direction. literally running for his life.}
<B>__{tracking with jason}
<A>__{he's just as quick, but smoother and more methodical. julius' point of view (hand held) heading up the alley, spotting a fire escape, diverting his course straight for it. angle fire escape as julius leaps onto it, dragging himself up, climbing as fast as is humanly possible. angle jason ...but jason is far from human, easily negotiating the wrought iron stairs and rapidly catching up.}
