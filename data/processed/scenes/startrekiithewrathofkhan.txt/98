<L>__{interior tunnel}
<A>__{trucking before carol and kirk. a rising light falls on their faces as they walk, then run with excitement toward the source. kirk races ahead... kirk's pov moving through the tunnel toward an iridescent light at its end, blindingly beautiful with color.}
<L>__{intercut: these two angles until we can hardly wait}
<A>__{for kirk to reach the end of the tunnel, and then, when it does:}
<L>__{interior genesis cave promontory level}
<A>__{where the rock tunnel ends. kirk comes out of the tunnel, and his mouth drops open. full shot the genesis cave (matte and fx) (formerly scene 130) a huge cavern. kirk is actually standing at the middle of it. space extends vastly above and below his point of view. like eden, lush growth everywhere, water falls, and a cobalt blue sky high, high above where a round orb glows sending light and warmth downward. there is a path from where kirk stands down to the lower level where bones, and the others are waiting and calling to him. mist and haze waft gently across the cavern.}
<B>__{back to kirk}
<A>__{as carol comes up beside him.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you did this in a day?!}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{the matrix formed in a day. the life forms grew later at a wildly accelerated rate. can i cook or can't i?}
