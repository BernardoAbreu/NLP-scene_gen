<A>__{the 'confession' lies on the big desk. angus' hand comes down upon it.}
<C>__{angus}
<D>__{you've read this?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{angus}
<D>__{and you want me to consider publishing it?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{angus}
<D>__{as part of our deal?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{angus}
<D>__{simon, this book, it's... it's really quite bad.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{that's what you said about my poem.}
<A>__{angus pauses and figures. he changes the subject.}
<C>__{angus}
<D>__{i'm offering you a very real expression of my faith in your writing. two hundred thousand dollars and a sixty forty split.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{but just exactly what is the nature of your faith in my writing?}
<C>__{angus}
<D>__{look, simon, you don't require my admiration. you require my experience as a publisher. and that experience leads me to believe your poem will make more money than any book of poetry ever published. in history. virtually make you a household name within two years. you'll never have to work on a garbage truck again, i assure you. or do anything else for that matter. whereas this 'confession' by henry fool...}
<A>__{he is at a loss for words.}
<C>__{angus}
<D>__{the most i can say for this is... the man is a scoundrel.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{he taught me everything i know.}
<C>__{angus}
<D>__{no! he encouraged all that was expressive in you to become manifest. he inspired you to act. he influenced your perception.}
<A>__{simon waits a while, staring at his shoes.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{how about if my advance is only a hundred thousand?}
<C>__{angus}
<D>__{it's not about money, simon.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{we could split the royalties seventy thirty.}
<C>__{angus}
<D>__{i will not publish henry fool's 'confession'.}
<A>__{simon sits and lets this sink in. angus waits, then...}
<C>__{angus}
<D>__{will you sign the contract?}
<A>__{simon continues looking out at the city. angus waits, but there is no response. finally, simon turns, pauses and slowly crosses the room. he sits at the table and looks down at the contract. he signs.}
