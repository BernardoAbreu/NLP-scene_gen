<L>__{interior styles' office day}
<A>__{hardy and osborne stand in front of an agitated styles. he tries to take a hit off his asthma inhaler and gets nothing. frustrated, he tosses it away.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{fucking asthma... this whole thing's driving it nuts.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{what i said before }
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{was dead right. you think dunbar's on the level?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{does osborne agree?}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{yes, sir, i do.}
<A>__{hardy lays a piece of paper on styles' desk.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{dunbar's confession. it should be enough to get you out of trouble.}
<A>__{styles looks at it and then slowly up to hardy.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{you want kendall, don't you?}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{he tried to burn dunbar to us. you don't do that if you're not involved.}
<A>__{hardy nods, agreeing. styles stares at them.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{you both know if you do this, if you go after a senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{we know.}
<C>__{styles}
<P>__{(to hardy)}
<D>__{i'm giving you a chance to walk away.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{we know.}
<A>__{styles nods and looks to his desk. almost to himself:}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{you don't get to be a colonel without compromising. without getting out of the way of the bigger dogs. you politic, play it safe, think of the career first. and when things get dirty, you just look the other way...}
<A>__{he looks back up at hardy. his eyes, steeled.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{four of my men are dead. you think kendall had something to do with it, then you go get the son of a bitch.}
