<D>__{steven zaillian final draft}
<T>__{in black and white:}
<A>__{train wheels grinding against track, slowing. folding table legs scissoring open. the lever of a train door being pulled. names on lists on clipboards held by clerks moving alongside the tracks.}
<C>__{clerks }
<D>__{...rossen... lieberman... wachsberg...}
<A>__{bewildered rural faces coming down off the passenger train. forms being set out on the folding tables. hands straightening pens and pencils and ink pads and stamps.}
<C>__{clerks }
<D>__{...when your name is called go over there... take this over to that table...}
<A>__{typewriter keys rapping a name onto a list. a face. keys typing another name. another face.}
<C>__{clerks }
<D>__{...youre in the wrong line, wait over there... you, come over here...}
<A>__{a man is taken from one long line and led to the back of another. a hand hammers a rubber stamp at a form. tight on a face. keys type another name. another face. another name.}
<C>__{clerks }
<D>__{...biberman... steinberg... chilowitz...}
<A>__{as a hand comes down stamping a gray stripe across a registration card, there is absolute silence... then music, the hungarian love song, "gloomy sunday," distant... and the stripe bleeds into color, into bright yellow ink.}
