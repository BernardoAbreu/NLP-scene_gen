<L>__{exterior onion field day.}
<A>__{sethe falls to the ground unable to move her contractions have started and the pain is unbearable. her breasts are leaking on her sweat stained body. her legs are scratched and bleeding from moving through broken twigs and rock. on her back, the tree is starting to form. she lays there waiting for death. until a voice asks:}
<C>__{amy }
<D>__{who that back there!}
<A>__{sethe can not answer as she hears two feet moving through the field. she clutches her pregnant stomach as if somehow she might hide it from whoever might be coming to harm her. a raggedly looking white girl with arms like cane stalks and enough hair for five heads steps through into view.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{look there. a nigger. if that don't beat all...}
<A>__{sethe can not speak for fear.}
