<L>__{interior enterprise engineering lab day}
<A>__{the b 9 stares placidly forward. we pull back and discover that computer conduits connect the b 9's head to data's head. geordi monitors the connection.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{at present he serves no useful function. dr. soong created us to become active and useful members of society. i do not believe he would have wanted the b 9 to live out his life in his present state.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{i can't believe the captain went along with a memory download.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{captain picard agrees that the b 9 was probably designed with the same self actualization parameters as myself. if my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{he'd have all your memories too. you feel comfortable with that?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{i feel nothing, geordi. it is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{an individual more like you, you mean.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{maybe he's not supposed to be like you. maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.}
<A>__{geordi completes his work}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{okay... we're done.}
<A>__{geordi removes the computer connections from between their heads. he carefully closes the panel in data's head as:}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(to b 9)}
<D>__{do you know where you are? b 9 i am in a room with lights.}
<A>__{he looks blankly at the console lights.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{can you remember our father? b 9 no.}
<A>__{data glances to geordi.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{do you know the name of the captain of this vessel? b 9 no.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{is that your final answer?}
<C>__{geordi}
<P>__{(to b 9)}
<D>__{do you know my name? b 9 you have a soft voice.}
<C>__{geordi}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{data, he's assimilating a lot of programming. remember, he's a prototype, a lot less sophisticated than you are. we just don't know if his matrix will be able to adapt. or if he'll be able to retain anything. we should give him some time.}
<A>__{data has been studying some circuitry in the b 9's neck.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{what purpose does this serve?}
<C>__{geordi}
<P>__{(also examining circuitry)}
<D>__{it seems to be a redundant memory port. maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{dr. soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{it's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. mind if i keep him here and run some diagnostics?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{no, i do not mind.}
<A>__{data looks at the b 9 with a sort of sadness.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{but i believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{don't give up hope, data. i know, i know, you're not capable of hope.}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(looking at b 9)}
<D>__{i am not.}
<A>__{data stands. the b 9 stands to follow.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{no, remain with commander la forge. he is going to try to make you well.}
<A>__{the b 9 sits. data goes. geordi watches him go.}
