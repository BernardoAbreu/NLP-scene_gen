<D>__{what ?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{payback, vance.}
<A>__{ blade aims his shotgun at vance's head. vance just smiles, seemingly unconcerned as abigail circles around the other side, getting a view behind vance's desk where vance's body lies on the floor. his throat has been ripped out. and this body is dressed like a doctor. king puts it together first, reaching for a silver stake even as we hear the sound of popping cartilage coming from beneath the vance double's flesh }

<D>__{jesus, it's him! it's drake!}
<A>__{the vance double jumps atop the desk and swats the muzzle of blade's shotgun aside, re directing the blast, which shatters a glass window. then he kicks blade in the chest, knocking him clear across the office as king advances. the vance double's face warps, the bones in his head shifting around. he reaches for king, slams him onto the desk, twists the stake from king's hand and brutally shoving it into king's rib cage, pinning him to the desk top. then the vance double whirls around to engage abigail only we see that it's drake now, having taken vance's shape.}
<B>__{drake}
<A>__{back hands abigail across the face, a teeth jarring blow. she spins, falling and drake is moving like a hurricane, leaping through the window that was shattered by blade's shotgun blast.}
<B>__{blade}
<A>__{gives chase. he looks out the window, sees drake landing on the ground, some three stories below.}
