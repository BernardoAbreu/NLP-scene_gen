<A>__{the key sounds in the lock and the door swings open. frank and cara tumble in together, laughing, a little tipsy. he glances at the sofa and that sobers him up, reminding him where he's going to sleep. however... he watches cara drop her wrap over a chair and kicks off her shoes. she throws open the french doors to the balcony. frank bypasses the sofa bed and follows her outside.}
