<L>__{exterior camp crystal lake night}
<A>__{the pick up truck's headlights skew across a weather worn sign, peppered with bullet holes: camp crystal lake erwin drives the truck through the deserted camp, past the cabins, down towards the lake. he stops a short distance away from the pier and the three of them climb out. meagan is still in shock, letting stormie guide her as erwin leads them down the pier to a small diving platform tied up to the end.}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{what'd you do take him for a swim?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{almost.}
<A>__{erwin jumps down on the diving platform. in the center, a large form is covered by a tarp. erwin helps stormie down onto the platform, leaving meagan standing on the pier. she looks out over the lake eyes vacant. erwin moves close to stormie and, gesturing to meagan, asks:}
<C>__{erwin}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{is she going to be alright?}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{i don't know. she's pretty fucked up. god, i don't know why i'm not...}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{you're a strong woman.}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{uhhh... nothing. i didn't mean anything.}
<A>__{stormie gestures to the tarp.}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{is this him?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{yeah...}
<P>__{(whips back tarp)}
<D>__{meet the new and improved jason.}
<A>__{angle on jason laying spread eagle on the diving platform, cocooned in chicken wire with dozens of coiled leads trailing off into the water. erwin has done a good job of sewing jason back together with barbed wire and fishing line. his arms and legs have been reinforced with steel braces and even jason's mask has been repaired, stitched down the middle with bailing wire. jason looks nineties... and butch.}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{why'd you put that stupid mask on him?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{take a look...}
<A>__{stormie bends down and takes a peek under the mask and quickly replaces it.}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{good idea.}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{not exactly a beauty queen entry, is he?}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{so what do we do now sing an ozzy osbourne song backwards or something?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{i'm afraid it's not that simple...}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{i thought you said you knew how to bring him back to life?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{i do! but when i was putting him back together, i noticed something was missing.}
<A>__{stormie thinks about this for a second, then:}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{awwww, he won't be needing that... i mean, what girl would let him put his rotten ol'...}
<C>__{erwin}
<P>__{(cuts her off)}
<D>__{no no! not that! it's his heart... it's missing.}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{well... does it really matter? can't you use an aquarium pump or something?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{no... he has to have a heart. a human heart. a good one.}
<A>__{meagan speaks for the first time:}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{i know where we can get a heart... a good one.}
