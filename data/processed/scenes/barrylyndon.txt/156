<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{do what one would to please her, my lady would never be happy or in good humor. and soon she added a mean, detestable jealousy to all her other faults, and would weep and wring her hands, and threaten to commit suicide, and i know not what.}
<A>__{she screams and shouts something about suicide. her son, brookside, comes running in and consoles her.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{her death would have been no comfort to me, as i leave any person of common prudence to imagine; for that scoundrel of a young brookside who was about to become my greatest plague and annoyance, would have inherited every penny of the property.}
