<L>__{interior police station day}
<A>__{jack runs to the front desk, crazed, dumps the armload of files on the desk in front of the desk sergeant...}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{i want you to arrest me. i'm the leader of a terrorist organization responsible for acts of vandalism all over the city. detective stern in arson knows who i am...}
<L>__{interior interrogation room later}
<A>__{detective stern and three detectives stand, staring at jack, who's seated. on the table are the phone bill and files.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{there are probably several hundred members in the metropolitan area. chapters are sprouting in at least five other major cities. they're tightly regimented, with many cells capable of operating without a central leader. check this address: 1537 paper street. you'll find the body of robert paulson buried in the garden. you'll also find numerous tubs used to make gallons of nitroglycerin. the plan, i believe, is to blow up these credit card headquarters and the trw building.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{why these buildings?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you are not your job. you are not how much money you have in the bank.}
<C>__{stern}
<P>__{(to other detectives)}
<D>__{keep him talking.}
<A>__{stern leaves. a beat, then, the remaining detectives smile at jack with reverence.}
<D>__{flat top detective i really admire what you're doing. you're a brave man to order this.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{redhead detective}
<D>__{you're a genius, sir.}
<A>__{they grab jack and force him on his back on the table. flat top has a rubber band; the bald detective has a knife.}
<C>__{bald detective}
<D>__{you know the drill. you said if anyone ever tries to interfere with project mayhem, even you, we got to get his balls.}
<A>__{flat top pulls jack's pants completely off, tosses them aside. jack screams. flat top holds his legs.}
<D>__{flat top it's useless to fight.}
<C>__{redhead}
<D>__{this is really a powerful gesture, mr. durden. it'll set quite an example.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no... you're making a mistake! flat top you told us you'd say that.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm not tyler durden!}
<C>__{baldy}
<D>__{you told us you'd say that, too.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{okay, i am tyler durden and i'm ordering you to abort the mission! flat top you said you would definitely say that.}
<C>__{baldy}
<D>__{what's our best time for a "cut and run?" flat top four minutes.}
<C>__{baldy}
<D>__{is somebody timing this?}
<C>__{redhead}
<P>__{(looks at his watch)}
<D>__{wait till the second hand gets to the twelve.}
<A>__{a knock at the door. flat top slaps a hand over jack's mouth. he and redhead block view of the table as baldy opens the door a crack. stern mutters:}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{some of this info checks out. let's go to the place on paper street.}
<A>__{baldy glances back at the other detectives, leaves, closing the door. the two remaining detectives continue. jack kicks and screams and writhes. the detectives wrangle him, but with more difficulty, now that baldy's gone.}
<C>__{redhead}
<P>__{(checking his watch)}
<D>__{mr. durden, you're going to fuck up the time!}
<A>__{jack gets one leg free, kicks, knocks flat top backwards flat top slams the wall, falls. redhead lets go of one of jack's arms, jams his elbow into jack's throat... cutting off the airway. jack's face reddens... he's choking... jack's free hand reaches, searching.. pulls redhead's gun and points it at him. redhead backs off. jack gets up, gasping for air, pistol whips flat top as he rises. jack grabs one of the files off the table.}
