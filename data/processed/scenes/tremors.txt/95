<L>__{interior burt & heather's house basement day}
<A>__{hearing that warning, burt and heather go into a well honed drill. they grab their hunting rifles and take positions at basement windows. burt scans with the binoculars. he sees nothing. he glances at heather. she shrugs. nobody coming.}
<C>__{burt}
<P>__{(into cb)}
<D>__{we don't see anything, val. now what the hell are you talking about? over.}
<A>__{val is frantic. how do you explain these things?}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{they're coming under ground! they ...they can dig like a son of a bitch...big monsters under the ground, burt! now get the hell out! hurry!}
<A>__{burt and heather exchange looks. has val gone nuts? then they hear a low rumble, growing louder and louder. tools hanging over the work bench start to shake; the decorative cow skulls on the wall rattle; the overhead lights sway and then everything stops. dead silence, except for the humming of the case cleaner. then the wall moves!! the wood paneling bulges slightly. nails pop out. the wall is pushed again; the paneling cracks. a cow skull falls. burt and heather level their rifles and a huge creature pushes right through the wall! fully half its bulbous, spiked body writhes into the center of the room, great multi part jaws drooling open, hook tentacles lashing out.}
