<A>__{dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display. leia and several other senators are to one side of the giant readout. the low ceilinged room is filled with starpilots, navigators, and a sprinkling of r2 type robots. everyone is listening intently to what dodonna is saying. han and chewbacca are standing near the back.}

<D>__{the battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. it's defenses are designed around a direct large scale assault. a small one man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.}
<A>__{gold leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands and addresses dodonna.}
<C>__{gold leader}
<D>__{pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?}
<C>__{dodonna}
<D>__{well, the empire doesn't consider a small one man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. an analysis of the plans provided by princess leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.}
<A>__{artoo detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping sounds, and turns his head from right to left.}
<C>__{dodonna}
<D>__{the approach will not be easy. you are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this pointerior the target area is only two meters wide. it's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. the shaft leads directly to the reactor system. a precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.}
<A>__{a murmer of disbelief runs through the room.}
<C>__{dodonna}
<D>__{only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. the shaft is ray shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.}
<A>__{luke is sitting next to wedge antilles, a hotshot pilot about sixteen years old.}
<C>__{wedge}
<D>__{that's impossible, even for a computer.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it's not impossible. i used to bull's eye womp rats in my t sixteen back home. they're not much bigger than two meters.}

<D>__{man your ships! and may the force be with you!}
<A>__{the group rises and begins to leave.}
