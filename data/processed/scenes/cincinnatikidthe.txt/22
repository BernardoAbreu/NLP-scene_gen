<L>__{interior kid's bedroom}
<A>__{it is night and the room is lit only by a single lamp where christian sits in her nightgown on a chair by the window, turning over the pages of a mail order catalogue. in f.g. the kid lies on his back under a sheet on the bed, his eyes closed and his hands clasped tensely behind his neck. he opens his eyes and turns to look at her. the movement catches her eye, and she instantly stops turning the pages, afraid the noise has disturbed him.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{it's all right. you don't have to act like a cat. you're not bothering me.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{you want me to turn out the light?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{no. i'm overtired, that's why i can't sleep.}
<P>__{(sits up and swings his feet to the floor)}
<D>__{why can't you sleep?}
<C>__{christian}
<P>__{(lightly)}
<D>__{undertired, i guess. if a person rests all day, she doesn't have much to rest up from at night.}
<P>__{(stands up)}
<D>__{why don't you have a nice hot bath? i could give you a rubdown and then you could have a nice hot bath, and then maybe you could sleep.}
<A>__{she waits at the foot of the bed for him to come slowly to a decision.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{'kay. can't hurt to try it.}
<A>__{she goes into the bathroom, where she turns the water on gently so the tub will take a long while to fill. then she takes a bottle of alcohol from the medicine chest and returns to the bedroom with it. she stands in front of him waiting for him to move, but the kid is singularly listless. not till she sets the bottle down does he respond by turning his face to the pillow. she goes right to work on his shoulder muscles, and she seems to know what she is doing.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{what did you do with yourself this time?}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{last night i went to a movie with the shooter's woman. french movie.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{in french?}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{they had the words in english at the bottom of the picture. but the shooter's woman knew what they were saying without it. pig's woman or somebody told me she went to college.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{sure. majored in man eating.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{i think maybe she really did go. but i never quite dared to up and ask her.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i didn't know you ran with the shooter's woman.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{we got to be kind of friendly when you both were in that three day game down to cairo. 'course she's older'n me.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{and been around more. a lot more. what was the movie like?}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{weird. it wasn't a straight story where you knew whose side you were on, the way you do in regular pictures.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{american pictures.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{yeah. there were lots of things i didn't understand.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{what was it about?}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{well, there's this town in europe a long time ago where they get a message from a spanish general he's coming to spend the night with his troops. so all the men are scared silly about what the soldiers will do to them.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{nothing weird about that.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{but all the wives and daughters tell the men to go hide somewhere and let them bargain with the enemy.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{that don't make much sense.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{wait. the way they handle it is they go to bed with the spaniards. and the next morning the soldiers go off peacefully and everybody's happy.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{including the husbands and fathers? don't they suspect?}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{that's part of what i wasn't sure of. i guess they know what went on but they care more about their safety and their money than they do about their honor.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{then they got their heads screwed on straight. honor's just an idea. you can't see or feel it and you can't eat it and you sure as hell can't get any mileage on it.}
<A>__{she slaps him on the rump and straightens up.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{i will just turn off the bath water.}
<A>__{he doesn't move but just stays relaxed and closes his eyes.}
