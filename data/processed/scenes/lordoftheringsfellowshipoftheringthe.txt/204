<A>__{strider watches from the shadows...as boromir strolls through the darkened gallery. boromir's eyes are drawn to an old fresco on the wall...depicting isildur defeating sauron. boromir looks with wonderment at narsil, the broken blade of elendil, which lies on a cloth covered plinth.}
<C>__{boromir}
<P>__{(quiet awe)}
<D>__{the shards of narsil...the blade that cut the ring from sauron's hand. boromir picks up the sword and gently touches the blade. close on: a small bloom of blood appears on boromir's finger...}

<A>__{boromir senses strider's presence...he looks from the blade to strider, as if sensing a connection.}
<C>__{boromir }
<D>__{but no more than a broken heirloom.}
<C>__{boromir }
<D>__{replaces the broken blade, but it clatters to the floor. boromir walks away, leaving strider sitting alone.}
<A>__{close on: strider picks up the broken hilt, as arwen appears behind him.}
<C>__{arwen}
<D>__{why do you fear the past? you are isildur's heir...not isildur himself. you are not bound to his fate.}
