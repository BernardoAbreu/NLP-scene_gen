<D>__{senator thompson i am honored to stand here today with you. i am humbled by your kind words, thank you. ladies and gentlemen, today marks the beginning of a fight between two sets of ideals. either we're going to move forward or were going to live in the past... either we're going to lead the world in technology, or we are going to bury our heads in the sand... the sands of saudi arabia...the sands of iraq! either we're going to let greed and corruption ruin our industries and our shorelines or we are going to take back our country! we are not a nation used to coming in second or third...}
