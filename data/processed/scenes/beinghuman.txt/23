<A>__{lucinnius is eager to talk, and tosses his words over his shoulder to hector.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{he's a true friend, probably the only one i have left.}
<A>__{hector obligingly trots a step or two closer to lucinnius to aid their conversation.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{will he lend you the money?}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{he was honest about it. he said so, plain and simple. no.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{that's a problem.}
<A>__{lucinnius unburdens himself.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{and the ships have gone... did i tell you that?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{have they?}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{cyprian knows already. he'll want his money back too...}
<A>__{we can see the concentration on hector's face as he concocts appropriate responses. he has a tough occupation, being the alter ego to an ambitious loser in one of the most competitive and dangerous societies ever to exist. and he has to carry the stool and the towel as well.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{when we get home i want you to get some chickens... and fetch hermas, the diviner.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{yes.}
