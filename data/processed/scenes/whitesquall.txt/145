<L>__{exterior building day}
<A>__{the crew huddle in the parking lot. fractured, confused. chuck, tod, charlie and bill, stand off by themselves.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{there's still a way.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{it's me, don't you see. terry's right, i'm the escape hatch. i disobeyed order.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{they don't know that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we were the only one's on deck. look, there's nothing they can do to me right? i'm a kid.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{but that's not the pointerior..}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{that is the pointerior.. and skipper'll slip off the hook.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{tod is on the stand.}
<C>__{downing}
<D>__{why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{i thought we'd have a better chance if i headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.}
<A>__{tyler removes his glasses.}
<C>__{downing}
<D>__{but the captain ordered you hard to starboard.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{twice.}
<C>__{downing}
<D>__{is that what you were trained to do?}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{downing}
<D>__{then what do you think he was trying to do.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{let the blow drive the boat down wind. neutralize our canvas.}
<A>__{skipper is becoming uneasy. he sees what is coming.}
<C>__{downing}
<D>__{so when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{then why son, why didn't you follow his order?}
<A>__{tod meets skipper's eyes.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{because i panicked.}
<A>__{the room is suddenly buzzing. tod's father stands up.}
<C>__{tod's father}
<D>__{that's not true tod.}
<C>__{terry}
<P>__{(to mike)}
<D>__{what the hell? what is he doing.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{son of a gun. he just sent skipper a life boat.}
<A>__{tyler turns to skipper.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{if this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{i don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{then what are you trying to say then?}
<A>__{skipper stands.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{maybe you can't see what's happening here, but it's clear to me.}
<P>__{(to tod)}
<D>__{i appreciate what you're trying to do tod. maybe you could live with it, but i couldn't.}
<P>__{(to tribunal)}
<D>__{if you think i'm going to let a sixteen year old take responsibility, then you underestimate me. the albatross was my ship. the ocean academy was my school. her loss is mine and mine alone.}
<P>__{(to others)}
<D>__{i can't bring your sons back. if you want my ticket, if that will ease your loss, it's the least i can do. this...}
<A>__{skipper pulls out his wallet and takes out his license.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{this is easy. living with it, that'll be hard.}
<A>__{skipper turns and lays his license down in front of tyler. then he turns and begins walking towards the back of the room. the room erupts. crew members and their families hurl accusations and blame. cameras flash. tyler tries to regain control. suddenly chuck stands, tall.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{no!!! don't you walk away! not now. not after all of this!!!!}
<A>__{skipper keeps walking. his head slumps. tyler pounds his gavel.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{that enough son!! order!! please!!}
<A>__{tears begin to stream down chuck's face. his father, charles, slowly stands meeting his sons eyes. go for it.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{tell me skipper, was it all just a lie? "where we go one, we go all". we listened to you. we believed it. and we're still here!!}
<A>__{skipper keeps moving.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{shame on you then skipper. shame on you.}
<A>__{skipper reaches for the door. suddenly a sound stops him cold in his tracks. phil slowly rises. tears streaming down his face. tightly in his hands he grips the ships bell. ding ding. ding ding. ding ding. it is the ringing of the truth. the tolling of their unity.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{sit down!}
<A>__{phil ignores him. skipper slowly walks over, his eyes never leaving phil's. he stops, facing him. he gently takes his hands and silences the bell. then he smiles and puts a hand on the back of phil's head fighting his own emotions. he turns to chuck.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{tell them the truth. make them understand.}
<A>__{the room grows silent.}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{you tell them chuck.}
<A>__{chuck suddenly feels the eyes of the room.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{it's simple. bad things happen sometimes. it wasn't skipper or tod. it was all of us. everyone in this room. because we all knew the risks.}
<P>__{(to parents)}
<D>__{you sent us... you paid our tuition, you allowed us to go. so to invent a reason for why this happened, to pin it on one person, well that won't change anything. it'll just make our experience meaningless.}
<A>__{he turns to the tribunal.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{if you want to judge this man, judge him by his crew. judge him by alice and george. chris and john and robin. in one way or another each one of them gave their lives saving one of us. this may sound crazy but the albatross wasn't just a ship, or even a school. it was something that we made, that's inside us. that's who skipper is. that's what he taught us. i guess what it really was about was... the privilege of sacrifice.}
<A>__{chuck turns to skipper.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{isn't that right?}
<A>__{skipper nods.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{the room is silent. then, a voice. a golden tenor singing like the wind. everyone turns. it's bill.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{when the sun came up, there was whisky in the cup, and not a one of us was sober...}
<A>__{one by one the crew members stand and begin to sing. chuck turns, surprised to see his father rise and stand with him. words or not.}
<C>__{crew together}
<D>__{jenny thought she saw a picture when it really was the sun, then we knew the party was over.}
<A>__{they all stand facing skipper and sing. the voices build, sweeping over everyone like a wave.}
<C>__{crew together}
<D>__{oh my heart is sad, for leaving you today, but i know we'll meet again, when the moon is in the valley and the leafs are on the trees, we will come to clearly in the glen...}
<A>__{skipper meets chuck's eyes and those of his mates. only now is his job finished. he beams back. the music swells like an anthem, building, like a swell lifting a small wooden boat over a jagged reef, until it rests safely in the calm waters beyond. the crew come together around skipper one last time. they embrace.}
