<A>__{a muzak version of "tie a yellow ribbon round the old oak tree," continues. a pizza delivery guy watches the numbers rise to the penthouse. suddenly the doors open to reveal...}
<L>__{interior hotel penthouse night}
<A>__{all four penthouse suites have been rented by ted. it's party central. very wild. quickly growing out of control. kids dance, play drinking games, spin the bottle, and generally trash the place. the pizza delivery guy wheels a dolly with a huge stack of pizzas into the party, only to be attacked by the prom goers like starving beasts. grabbing the pizzas. devouring them hungrily. ted's luxurious hotel suite ted, charlie, the taylor triplets and several buddies lounge around, drunkenly watching the home shopping channel on ted's big screen tv. a tacky ceramic gnome rotates on the screen. ted swigs dom perignon straight from the bottle. he shouts orders into his cell phone...}

<D>__{hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no, leave one. somebody's grandmother might want one.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{and while you're at it, i will take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i love those springy head puppies!}
<A>__{corridor moments later ted looks up as the elevator doors open. principal merkin has arrived. ted confronts him...}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you kicked us off your turf, merk. don't rain on our parade.}
<C>__{principal merkin}
<D>__{mr. nelson, you disappoint me. first you break our school board rules. then you break the law.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what law, merk? having fun? letting down our hair on prom night?}
<C>__{principal merkin}
<D>__{our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you called the cops on us?}
<C>__{principal merkin}
<D>__{alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.}
<A>__{suddenly the whole xenia police force appears, in full riot gear. the party's over. everyone runs for the stairs. ted gives principal merkin a spiteful look and joins the mass exodus.}
