<D>__{a small version of him appears superimposed on the bar, dressed as an explorer and discovering the life size version of himself. the big version watches the little version load his rifle. then the little version shoots at the big version, but the big version just smiles. little version runs off shot to get help, and he comes back with a tribe of african warriors, all bearing spears. they attack. big version tries to defend himself, staggers as he gets to his feet, tries to gesture to the barman, but he is so drunk that he falls straight backwards without making the slightest attempt to stop his fall. the africans leap about with joy.}
