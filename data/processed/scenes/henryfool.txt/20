<L>__{interior world of donuts day}
<A>__{same time. henry enters and takes simon's notebook from his pocket. he flips through a few pages and selects one in particular. he tears it out of the book and tapes it up beside the register so customers can read it. he winks at gnoc. she smiles shyly and makes him a coffee. he takes it and moves off to a table just as... vicky enters. she starts accumulating groceries, placing them on the counter one item at a time. henry settles down and watches as... vicky returns to the counter with a bottle of orange juice and notices the poem. she reads, holding the orange juice out to her side. gnoc starts to ring up the other purchases as her father comes up behind her, busying himself with an inventory of the cigarettes. vicky's lip starts to tremble as she reads, a horrified expression clouding her face. finally... smash!!!! she drops the bottle of orange juice and stands back. mr deng and gnoc jump back, alarmed. henry tilts his head and pays close attention.}
