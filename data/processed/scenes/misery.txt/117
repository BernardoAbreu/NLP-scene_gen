<A>__{paul lies still. he looks around the room and listens for sounds. all he hears are the sounds of a winter night in the mountains. after a few beats, he takes a deep breath and then begins his greatest effort of all: to force his body out of bed, to make it move. he's still weak from what he's endured, but that's not the main thing: it's the pain. any attempt at movement and his legs scream. he sags back, lies there still a moment. slowly he tries to maneuver his body off the bed. he rolls over onto his stomach, then tries to lower himself onto the floor by moving down head first. his good arm hits the floor, and he is able to hold himself up but, realizing there is no way to get out of bed without causing tremendous pain, he girds himself and flings himself out of bed and comes crashing to the floor. the pain is excruciating. after he regains his composure, he slowly crawls toward the door. he reaches up and tries the handle. it is, in fact, locked. he awkwardly tries to slam up against the door, but it is much too painful and to no avail. he crawls back over to the bed, realizes there's no way to climb back in, then grabs the blanket from the bed, wraps it around himself, and closes his eyes.}
