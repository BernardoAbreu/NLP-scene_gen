<D>__{you know the problem with hollywood? they make shit. unbelievable, unremarkable shit. i'm not some grungy filmmaker wannabee searching for existentialism through a haze of bong smoke. it's easy to pick apart bad acting, short sighted directing, or the purely moronic stringing together of words many of the studios term as prose. no, i'm talking the lack of realism. realism. not a pervasive element in the modern american cinematic vision.}
