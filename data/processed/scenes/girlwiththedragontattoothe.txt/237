<A>__{blomkvist tries to steady his breathing as he slinks around the side of the house. as he passes a window, it lights up and we again hit the ground with him. he hurries across the yard, trips over something in the dark a sprinkler? and goes down again into wet muck. he gets up and starts down the road as if returning from a leisurely evening walk which would be more convincing without the limp not daring to look back as he goes.}
<D>__{martin o s hello? mikael?}
<A>__{blomkvist stops. his heart pounds. martin comes down his porch and walks toward his car.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{your evening stroll?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{hi. how are you?}
<A>__{martin pulls a golf bag from his trunk and shoulders it.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i stopped at the hospital on my way home. henrik asked me to ask you something.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{what.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{come on in, i will make you a drink.}
<A>__{naturally, this is the last thing blomkvist wants to do, but it would be more suspicious if he refuses. he heads back to martin's house, trying not to limp.}
