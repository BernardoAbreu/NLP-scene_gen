<A>__{with fire and determination, leonard jogs. unfortunately, he is quickly winded by the run. he bends over, gasping. superimpose shot over shot: leonard appears, running past his old, weaker self. stronger, he makes a few more yards and then is forced to stop. he leans over for air, and we superimpose another shot over shot of leonard, weeks later, running past his weaker self. (this series of shots repeats a few more times, illustrating the progression of time and weight loss.)}
