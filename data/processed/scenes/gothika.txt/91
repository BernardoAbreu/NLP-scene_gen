<L>__{interior miranda's new cell day}
<A>__{a better room, in fact. this one has a view. heavy bars on the windows, but still. miranda paces. pete is seated, observing her deteriorating state.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{did you live here when rachel killed herself?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{yes. as a matter of fact, i was part of the search party that found the body.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{phil must have been a wreck.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you can imagine. actually, phil was in houston undergoing triple bypass surgery when it happened.}
<A>__{what was that? miranda reacts to this.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{and this is confirmed. there are hospital records and so forth?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i'm sure there are. can we get back on track now?}
<A>__{miranda pulls out the folded printout from her pocket.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{what about these other dates, was phil here when the other girls went missing and found dead?}
<A>__{a disconcerted pete looks at the article with the pictures of rachel and the others: andrea white and jenny dixon.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{where are you going with this? first i'm a suspect in doug's death, now what, phil parsons murdered his own daughter?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{rachel parsons disappeared six years ago. a week later she's a suicide. andrew white, four years ago, same m.o., and jenny dixon, two years ago. don't you find that unusual?}
<A>__{he regards her. maybe parsons is right: she's desperately grasping at straws now. skims the article:}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{what same m.o.? one jumped off a bridge, one hung herself and one crashed her car. who gave you this?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{not one left a suicide note. in fact, how is anybody sure these were suicides?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you heard phil, his daughter had tried several times before }
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{that's his story. i need to talk to the reporter who wrote that. frank something.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{well, you can't.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i beg to differ. i know my visitation rights.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you can't because... he died.}
<A>__{miranda snaps to attention here.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{you're telling me the one local investigative reporter who connected three highly suspicious deaths, just happens to have conveniently died?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{frank albright was an eighty year old retired sociology professor.}
<P>__{(re: the article)}
<D>__{this is a fluff piece about teenage depression and the breakdown of the nuclear family. you can find one in any local paper, anywhere, any other week!}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{don't be smug, pete. that's one thing you've never been. rachel is somehow connected to what i'm going through. i don't know how like you said, i'm not in a frame of mind to process the information without assistance. so i'm asking you for assistance.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{listen to me. you are not well. i had hoped once you remembered the murder we could deal with your feelings about it but these fixations:}
<C>__{pete }
<D>__{rachel parsons, chloe mcgrath are self created distractions to avoid looking into yourself. and the longer you }
<C>__{miranda}
