<L>__{interior coffee shop morning}
<A>__{louise is sitting in the booth by herself. thelma comes hurrying by. she looks disheveled but is grinning like an idiot. she sees louise and charges into the coffee shop. her energy and volume is several notches higher than the rest of the people in the coffee shop. there are a couple more customers in there now. thelma slides into the booth seated directly across from louise.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{she is shocked by thelma's appearance.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{what happened to your hair?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{nothing. it got messed up.}
<A>__{louise is studying thelma closely as thelma squirms in her seat, barely able to contain herself.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{what's wrong with you?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{nothing. why? do i seem different?}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{yes, now that you mention it. you seem crazy. like you're on drugs.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{well, i'm not on drugs. but i might be crazy.}
<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{i don't think i wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.}
<A>__{thelma is just about to shriek when the waitress comes over and puts a coffee cup on the table and pours some. thelma gets a grip on herself for a moment then loses it as the waitress goes away.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{oh my god, louise!!! i can't believe it! i just really can't believe it! i mean... whoa!}
<A>__{thelma is just laughing hysterically. louise suddenly understands.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{oh, thelma. oh, no.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i mean i finally understand what all the fuss is about. this is just a whole 'nother ball game!}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{thelma, please get a hold of yourself. you're making a spectacle.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{you know, louise, you're supposed to be my best friend. you could at least be a little bit happy for me. you could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life i have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i am happy. i'm very happy for you. i'm glad you had a good time. it's about time. where is he now?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{taking a shower.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{you left that guy alone in the room?}
<A>__{louise is getting a bad feeling. she is already standing up putting money on the table.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{where's the money, thelma?}
<A>__{thelma has forgotten all about the money.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{ummm... it's on the table. it's okay.}
<A>__{they are both leaving the restaurant now. as they hit the door they both break into a full run.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i don't remember.}
