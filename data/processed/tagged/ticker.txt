<L>__{exterior metropolitan city downtown late night}
<A>__{hot summer night. the flesh district hookers working the sidewalks, stopping cars. mike reilly, 20s, paces a corner, restless, looking for action ... wet hair, three day beard, trenchcoat, sneakers, heat seeking weary eyes. he flashes a wad of bills in an effort to get some attention... no one notices. across the street, bill rice, 50's, a ragged transient, strolls over.}
<C>__{rice}
<D>__{know what the problem is, kid? you're too ugly to get propositioned.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{look who's talking, old man.}
<C>__{rice}
<D>__{c'mon, it's a quiet night.}
<A>__{rice starts away. reilly pauses, then trudges after him.}
<L>__{exterior sidestreet night}
<A>__{rice and reilly pull donuts and coffee out of a bag, talk with their mouths full as they walk.}

<D>__{next week we work the park.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{i gotta get back on top. get off the sleaze detail.}
<C>__{rice}
<D>__{you will, one day at a time. i will be old and grey when it happens...}
<A>__{they share a grin, pass a bag lady who wears a pie tin crown, holding her hand out to a pimp getting into a cadillac.}
<C>__{bag lady}
<D>__{a small gift, sir, for the queen ...}
<A>__{the pimp ignores her, screeches off. the bag lady pulls out a pad, adds his license number to a list, glances up at rice and reilly.}
<C>__{bag lady }
<D>__{i keep a record, see? they don't pay, i don't forget.}
<A>__{rice fishes some change out of his pocket.}
<C>__{rice}
<D>__{here you go, your highness.}
<C>__{bag lady}
<D>__{thank you, officer.}
<A>__{she pushes her shopping cart away. rice and reilly look at each other, crack up, surprised she knew he was a cop.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{so what'll you do? after they give you the gold watch.}
<C>__{rice}
<D>__{hell, i got a gold watch... it just don't work. maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{you don't fish.}
<C>__{rice}
<D>__{how hard can it be? the grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{you outta the city... that's a fish out of water. what's with all this family talk lately, anyway?}
<C>__{rice}
<D>__{one of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. when that happens, you'll wish you had family.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{no thanks. i got close but it never woulda worked.}
<A>__{they stop beside a dirty, beat up studebaker parked in the alley, climb in, reilly behind the wheel.}
<B>__{inside the studebaker}
<A>__{cluttered with debris clothes, boxes, personal items. reilly jiggles the ignition the engine coughs and sputters, finally turns over.}
<C>__{rice}
<D>__{why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{what are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.}
<C>__{rice}
<D>__{i thought you said what's her name's brother was going to fix it.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{she didn't work out, had to cut her loose.}
<C>__{rice}
<D>__{what was it this time?}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{she wanted to cook me breakfast.}
<A>__{the white van appears up ahead and turns into a seemingly deserted building's garage. reilly and rice exchange a glance as they wait to see lights come on in the building. they don't. two flashlight beams criss cross through the windows of the building briefly, then disappear. they hear a brief heated argument, that is cut short abruptly. then silence.}
<C>__{reilly }
<D>__{c'mon, let's check it out.}
<C>__{rice}
<D>__{we're vice, i didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. but if you're so gung ho, we'd best call it in for some back up.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{nah, let's just take a look see.}
<A>__{reilly jumps out and heads for the building. rice rolls his eyes, follows.}
<L>__{interior building night}
<A>__{a huge, old, battered machine shop. spooky darkness, dead quiet. moonlight filters in through dirt smeared windows. the door creaks as reilly and rice slip in, stop, eyes scan. nothing. just rows of glistening machines. rice gestures for reilly to spread out. they head in, footsteps echoing, shadows washing over them. still nothing...deeper, deeper... then, glancing over, reilly sees a shape hiding behind a machine. he steps towards it. the shape whirls a beautiful spitfire of a girl with piercing blue eyes. she tries to bolt. reilly grabs her. she struggles, pulls a knife, slashes his arm, drawing blood through his trenchcoat.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{ow! son of a bitch.}
<A>__{he punches her full force in the face she collapses, knocked out cold. rice rushes over.}
<C>__{rice}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{yeah, just a nick ...}
<A>__{then, over reilly's shoulder, rice sees a dark silhouette emerging from behind a machine. rice draws his pistol.}
<C>__{rice}
<D>__{freeze! police!}
<A>__{as reilly whirls, the silhouette raises a mac 11. rice shoves reilly aside as the silhouette opens fire... diving for cover, reilly flings back his trenchcoat, whips out his 9mm and returns fire at the silhouette, blowing the shit out of windows behind, sparks showering off machines. silence for an instant, reilly looks for rice and finds him bleeding to death on the floor nearby he is completely exposed to the line of fire. the silhouette and another figure open fire on reilly. swan, 40s, crazy brilliant, manic eyes... and one of his men, pale, sweaty, wearing an earring, 30s, continue the barrage. swan fires one shot at a time at rice, deliberately aiming not to kill him, trying to flush reilly out. rice screams as bullets rip into his legs. reilly tries to reach him but can't, shots forcing him back. a dark eyed man with a beard appears in the b.g. and stealths towards reilly from behind. reilly' face is in agony as rice moans in pain. he glances urgently from the gunmen to the exit behind them, to the girl lying next to him what's keeping them there? obviously the girl. she stirs. desperate, reilly grabs her by the hair, shoves his 9mm to her head. using her as a shield, he drags her in front of rice to protect him.}
<C>__{reilly}
<P>__{(to gunmen)}
<D>__{drop it!}
<A>__{swan's eyes flare. he steps out into the open, gun aimed at rice, eyes locked murderously on reilly.}
<C>__{swan}
<D>__{let her go.}
<A>__{reilly cocks his hammer, fingers trembling. the girl stiffens, terrified. beard emerges behind reilly. deadly silent, he raises an automatic, trying to get a clear shot between machines...}
<C>__{swan }
<D>__{no, the girl!}
<A>__{reilly whirls, sees beard, shrinks back to stay covered.}
<C>__{earring}
<P>__{(to swan)}
<D>__{we gotta get outta here!}
<C>__{reilly}
<P>__{(to swan)}
<D>__{tell them to drop it now!}
<A>__{a deadly stalemate. faraway sirens wail.}
<C>__{swan}
<D>__{you have no idea how sorry you're going to be.}
<P>__{(to the girl)}
<D>__{don't worry.}
<A>__{beard smolders, earring sweats. keeping their guns up, the three men grab tool bags, work their way to the alley door and slip out. the moment they're gone, reilly quickly handcuffs the girl to a machine, kneels, cradles rice.}
<C>__{rice}
<D>__{mike...}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{don't talk.}
<C>__{rice}
<D>__{take your time... one day at a time, kid...}
<A>__{rice takes reilly's hand and pats it on his wristwatch.}
<C>__{rice }
<D>__{it's all i got... it's yours.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{it don't work }
<C>__{rice}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{ain't that a shit }
<A>__{rice's eyes go blank, he exhales his last breath. reilly winces, eyes welling up. his gaze moves at the girl. the girl stares uncomfortably, a blink of sympathy stealing past her hard exterior ...}
<L>__{interior police headquarters morning}
<A>__{looking numb, out of place, rice's blood still on his trenchcoat, reilly walks in, weaves through a chaos of ringing phones, overworked cops, suspects being booked. cops look up, whisper about him. turning a corner, reilly bumps into a bulldog of a cop, harry, hustling the girl out of a booking room. she's got a shiner where reilly hit her. the girl and reilly make eye contact, intimate somehow, a flash of vulnerability and fear in the girl's face...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{hey, reilly, captain's looking for you.}
<A>__{reilly snaps out of it, continues on. reilly nods as harry hustles the girl away.}
<L>__{interior captain's office day}
<A>__{behind his desk, a work weary captain, winters, 50s, sucks coffee as he grills artie pluchinsky, 40s, a slick suit and tie homicide detective.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{prints?}
<C>__{pluchinsky}
<D>__{nothing so far.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{what about the ballistics report?}
<C>__{pluchinsky}
<D>__{lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.}
<A>__{reilly walks in.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{captain...}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{reilly, what the hell happened out there? why didn't you call for back up?}
<C>__{reilly}
<P>__{(at a loss, sad)}
<D>__{sir, i }
<A>__{reilly looks at his watch (we notice he's now wearing rice's watch). he taps it, listens to see if it's ticking.}
<C>__{winters }
<P>__{(softening)}
<D>__{dammit, rice was a good man,}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{i want to work this.}
<C>__{pluchinsky}
<D>__{you're vice, not homicide. besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{but sir }
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{you know the rules. you're off the street `til i.a.d. clears the investigation. now go home and clean yourself up, get some rest...}
<A>__{harry barges in, dumps a bag of personal effects on the desk.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{she won't talk. look at this shit, no i.d., nothing...}
<A>__{reilly picks up a twisted plastic wire bracelet.}
<C>__{pluchinsky}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{bracelet she was wearing.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in scranton.}
<C>__{pluchinsky}
<D>__{maybe she knows your old man.}
<A>__{reilly sears into pluchinsky.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{take it down to the bomb squad, artie }
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{i will do it.}
<A>__{winters eyes him for a beat, relents...}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{okay, kid. run this down to the cave.}
<A>__{reilly spins and exits quickly.}
<L>__{interior police station basement day}
<A>__{emerging from a dingy back staircase, reilly enters a hallway and moves to a door a door marked "bomb squad."}
<L>__{interior police station "the cave" day}
<A>__{reilly enters into another world a dungeon cluttered with bomb paraphernalia, defusing equipment, a dog house, ping pong table, sheryl crow pin up, chicago bears posters, yassir arafat dartboard, a photo shrine to dead bomb squaders. a plain, fresh faced assistant, bev, 30s, looks up from her computer station.}
<C>__{bev}
<D>__{may i help you?}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{i'm looking for the bomb squad.}

<C>__{reilly}
<P>__{(flashes badge)}
<D>__{bomb squad.}
<A>__{the officer nods and moves the barricade out of the way, reilly hits the gas, rumbles through. the studebaker swings past a fire truck, an ambulance, and two squads cars. two officers stand near a building with a worried businessman and his chauffeur. reilly parks 50 yards from a limo stopped in the middle of the street. a bomb squad van and sleek black harley davidson parked beyond it. reilly hops out, heads cautiously for the limo pooch, 50s, a barrel chested ex football player is on his hands and knees looking under the limo. red rubber ball in hand, hawaiian shirt half tucked in, he leads around an equally scruffy labrador retriever, schnoz.}

<C>__{glass}
<D>__{alright boys, look close. let's assess.}
<A>__{glass, pooch and t.j. take a beat just to look at the shoebox. then, glass nods for reilly to move away. reilly takes a few steps back, watching as the team works together glass in charge a psychic connection between them as they pass tools back and forth like surgeons.}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{whadaya think, "boy" or "girl"?}
<A>__{glass puts on magnifying spectacles precise, organized, a detail freak as he uses a wooden probe to test the box for wires, sensors. as the others watch, glass rubs his fingertips ritualistically and carefully eases the top off the box. he reaches in... grabs something... slowly pulls it out ... it's a mickey mouse alarm clock doll, a clump of unlit firecrackers taped between mickey's legs. the bomb squaders whoop and howl all except pooch who pulls out a pack of tums, shoves half of it in his mouth.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{it's a "girl" !}
<A>__{they all crack up, hysterical. reilly stares in disbelief these guys are nuts! moments later at the bomb squad van in the b.g., the officers finish getting a statement from the businessman as the still worried chauffeur inspects the limo. t.j. and pooch load their equipment into the van as glass fills out paperwork.}
<C>__{t.j.}

<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{fire in the hole!}
<A>__{glass tosses it into a sewer drain. a beat, then a small explosion, smoke billows out of the gutter drain. the nearby officers jump, alarmed. the bomb squad guys laugh. glass waves to the officers.}

<P>__{(to reilly)}
<D>__{that's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.}

<A>__{earring stares uneasily. swan and beard look up, freeze. a pair of patrol cops are heading directly towards them. earring reaches under his jacket... swan grabs earring's arm, calming him. the cops keep coming, then at the last moment, they veer left and slide into a booth. swan nods, they get up and casually slip outside.}

<D>__{too easy. there's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.}

<C>__{glass}
<D>__{ease your thumb over to the right feel anything?}
<A>__{reilly eyes shift as his hidden fingers feel around...}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{yeah, another round thing.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{which one's which?}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{what... ?}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{when in doubt, pull the yellow wire.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{how the hell do you feel yellow?}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{no excuses, just do it!}
<L>__{10... reilly glares at glass. 9... his face is dripping with sweat. 8... his fingers shift back to the first cap. 7... they close over it, ready to pull. 6... but then they stop. 5... reilly frowns. 4... glass stabs him with a look. 3... 2... lightning quick, reilly' fingers fly back and yank}
<A>__{the second cap out of its base. the counter stops. 0:01. reilly and glass and stare at it, holding their breath, hardly daring to believe it's true. they whoop and explode with relief. it's over... it's finally over.}
<C>__{glass }
<D>__{not bad, for a rookie.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{reilly and glass turn to mary who has lost consciousness but is still holding the remote tightly. glass looks up to see t.j. and bev peeking from around their van.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{all clear, but we need an ambulance!}
<A>__{bev jumps into the van to make the call as t.j. starts limping towards the u haul. schnoz yelps and drops from the van and runs for the u haul. reilly cradles mary in his lap as glass kneels and removes the remote the red light stops flashing, then turns off. t.j. arrives and looks down at reilly and mary, then at the device in the u haul.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{nice work.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior police station squad room day}

<C>__{bev}
<D>__{hey, you look great.}
<A>__{t.j. flinches, but she winks at him to calm him down. t.j. smiles... no longer threatened. glass doesn't look up from his computer.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{you're late.}
<A>__{glass points to the work station next to him where a bomb squad protocol program is waiting on the screen. reilly smiles and he sits next to glass, hands him the transfer papers envelope.}

<D>__{welcome to the family.}
<A>__{glass accepts the papers and shakes reilly's hand.}
