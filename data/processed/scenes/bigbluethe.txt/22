<L>__{exterior construction site day}
<A>__{the diver surfaces, gasping for breath. a cheer goes up from the crowd. several men hurry to pull him onto dry land. but there is no sign of enzo. everyone waits, breathless.}
<C>__{roberto}
<P>__{(to the supervisor)}
<D>__{sign here.}
<A>__{suddenly, enzo appears, burst out of the water, holding his flippers up in the air like a trophy. the onlookers cheer, help him out of the water, slapping him on the back. enzo tosses the jack and his flippers to roberto. impassive and silent, he slips his arms into the prize fighter's robe that roberto holds out for him, walks solemnly back to his car. roberto takes the check and walks over to the car. enzo bends down into the car and opens the roof.}
<C>__{supervisor}
<P>__{(through the open roof smiling)}
<D>__{thanks, thanks a lot. i mean that too... you extortionist bastard!}
<A>__{the car rushes off. in the distance we see a police (carabinieri) car and an old fire engine rolling in the direction of the construction site. inside fiat driving away enzo's car drives past them. enzo looks at roberto out of the corner of his eye, then suddenly explodes with joy.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{dollars, roberto! we took him for ten thousand dollars!}
<A>__{roberto whoops and whistles. enzo reaches over and leans on the horn. the little car races by and finally stops at the top of the cliff facing the sea.}
