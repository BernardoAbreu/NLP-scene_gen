<L>__{interior dispensary spock's eyes}
<A>__{camera bridging back out through spock's eyes and into angle on spock's face as he lies in a sickbay bed. his eyes are open; he is staring straight ahead as if in a catatonic state, completly unaware of his surroundings. then doctor chapel leans into scene, moving a medical scanner over the brain area.}
<C>__{chapel}
<D>__{now scanning pons area at spinal nerve fiber connection...}
<A>__{angle on mccoy and kirk mccoy at a console, watching readings he is getting from chapel's scanner. kirk watches mccoy anxiously.}
<D>__{mccoy indications of some neurological trauma the power pouring through that mind meld must have been staggering...}
<A>__{before kirk can reply, they hear a laugh! an abrupt, harsh, bitter laugh.}
<B>__{across them to sickbay}
<A>__{as all whirl to the patient area where it is obviously spock who has just laughed but there is no indication of laughter from him now. a startled chapel has stepped back away from the bed. spock seems to be attempting to focus, orient himself as kirk and mccoy hurry to the bedside.}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{jim...}
<A>__{and spock reaches out a hand weakly., takes a surprised kirk's hand in his. mccoy exchanges a surprised glance with kirk, as spock clutching kirk's hand in friend ship and need struggles to summon strength to speak.}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{this simple feeling...}
<P>__{(looks at kirk)}
<D>__{... is so far beyond v'ger's comprehension.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{with kirk and mccoy exchanging another surprised glance (at spock's emotion), with mccoy gesturing kirk not to question it.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{were you right? spock? v'ger is a living machine...?}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{a life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.}
<C>__{chapel}
<P>__{(reacting)}
<D>__{a living machine ...?! mccoy}
<P>__{(to chapel)}
<D>__{we're living machines, too: protein mechanisms.}
<A>__{kirk nods at mccoy.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{and it considers the enterprise a living machine: that's why the probe refers to our ship as an entity.}
<C>__{chapel}
<D>__{if it thinks our ship is alive what does it think we are? mccoy}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{an 'infestation' bacteria... microbes.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{as spock turns to kirk.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{i saw v'ger's planet: a planet populated by living machines. unbelievable technology.}
<P>__{(pained)}
<D>__{v'ger has knowledge that spans this universe. and... in all this order... all this magnificence, v'ger feels no awe...no delight... no beauty...}
<P>__{(a beat; exhausted)}
<D>__{i should have known...}
<A>__{kirk waits for spock to continue, but spock seems too weak.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{know what, spock? what?}
<A>__{but spock falls back, exhausted and mccoy gently tugs at kirk, ad libbing, "let him rest, jim..." kirk shrugs mccoy away, addresses spock:}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what should you have known?}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(weak)}
<D>__{no meaning... no hope...}
<P>__{(summoning strength)}
<D>__{and, jim, no answers...! jim, it's looking for answers itself !}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{what answers?}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{'is this all i am? is there not more?'}
<A>__{just then an intercom signal:}
<C>__{uhura's voice}
<D>__{a faint signal from starfleet, sir! intruder cloud has been located on their outer monitors for past twenty seven minutes... dissipating rapidly as it approaches.}
<A>__{immediately, sulu's voice:}
<C>__{sulu's voice}
<D>__{starfleet reports forward velocity has slowed to sub warp speed! we are three minutes from earth's orbit! }
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(into intercom)}
<D>__{i will be right there...}
<P>__{(to chapel; crisp)}
<D>__{i need spock on the bridge.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{as chapel urns to a med tech, ad libs an order, "dalaphaline, twenty cc's..." as the tech quickly sets the hypo injector, and hands it to chapel and she injects spock, the hypo emitting a fast, quiet hiss kirk gazes at spock just an instant as spock breathes deeply, the drug clearly strengthening him. chapel and the tech help spock from the bed, as kirk addresses mccoy:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{a machine planet...? sending a machine to earth looking for its creator ...? mccoy god.}
<A>__{kirk looks at him, then at spock on his feet now then at mccoy again:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{'to find the creator,' the probe said. find god ...? mccoy isn't that what we're all trying to do...?}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{all us machines...?}
<A>__{kirk stands facing him another moment, then whirls and steps to the monitor, flips some buttons, and peaks into his communicator.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{mr. chekov, commander decker's present location?}
<C>__{chekov's voice}
<D>__{he... they... are in engineering, sir.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(into intercom)}
<D>__{i want to make a ship's announcement. but it's to be heard only in engineering.}
<C>__{uhura's voice}
<D>__{ready, captain.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(voice amplified)}
<D>__{this is the captain speaking. it appears that the alien ship ... v'ger... is not a manned vessel ...}
<B>__{engineering}
<A>__{showing scott (at his console) listening to kirk's words and facing decker and "ilia" who are just about to leave engineering. (in b.g. the engine core glows the appropriate color, and there is a soft hum of idle power.) kirk's voice continues:}
<C>__{kirk's voice}
<P>__{(amplified)}
<D>__{it is a living entity...! a machine life form. we are attempting to ascertain its intentions. all personnel will maintain yellow alert status !}
<A>__{closer on decker and "ilia" the probe bland as usual, but kirk's words seem to have strangely elated decker; he says to her:}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{a machine...! then it had to be programmed. by whom ...? "ilia" by the creator.}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(probing)}
<D>__{to join, and become one with the creator? "ilia" to learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the creator on the third planet. that is the programming.}
<B>__{include scott}
<A>__{just now confronting them, regarding "ilia" with open disapproval.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{well, sir, now what about all that? a living entity, the captain says... entity... a living thing...!}
<A>__{decker really hasn't heard scott; he's gazing at "ilia," attempting to digest what she's just said. but quickly:}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{thank you, scotty...}
<A>__{he moves to leave.}
<C>__{scott}
<P>__{(dourly)}
<D>__{your welcome, sir.}
<A>__{now decker and "ilia" move toward the exit, scott gaz ing after them glaringly, watching "ilia's" every move. suddenly, almost into the corridor, "ilia" turns and looks back at the engine room. she addresses decker, but load enough for scott to overhear:}
<D>__{"ilia" there is no logical reason for carbon units to control enterprise's power systems.}
<C>__{scott}
<P>__{(to "ilia")}
<D>__{lassie, if i were functioning 'logically,' right now i'd be showing you the inside of our scrap metal compactor!}
