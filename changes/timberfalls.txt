<LOC>__{INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1}
<ACTION>__{CLOSE ON - A YOUNG WOMAN'S EYE. Bloodshot blue. Her eyelashes tremble. A tear rolls out. She blinks. CLOSE ON - A filthy, coarse rope secures a dirty rag inside her mouth. CLOSE ON - The same type rope binds her ankles together. CLOSE ON HER HANDS - A mixture of blood, dirt.   IRON SPIKES}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ARE NAILED THROUGH HER PALMS.}
<ACTION>__{FROM ABOVE - The Young Woman, 20s, wearing a handmade dress with a small crest embroidered over the heart, lies nailed to a wooden table. AN OVERHEAD LIGHT BULB DIMS, CRACKLES.    OFF SCREEN: A BLOOD- CURDLING SCREAM cries out. The Young Woman's breathing intensifies.   She watches the light bulb, listens to the screams. The light bulb returns to normal. The screams stop.    Peace for a moment. But she knows that won't last.}
<LOC>__{INT.   TORTURE ROOM #2}
<ACTION>__{A YOUNG MAN, 20s, hangs by his wrists from iron shackles secured to the ceiling. He's bloodied, bruised... a mess. CLOSE ON - The end of a pair of jumper cables. They TOUCH, sending SPARKS into the air. Brought together by... A CONCEALED FIGURE. All that's visible are his hands.    His left hand is SEVERELY BURNED, SCARRED, while his right appears normal. He touches the jumper cables together again... SPARKS FLY.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Please-please stop. D-don't.}
<ACTION>__{The Concealed Figure ignores his pleas, connects the left cable to one shackle chain... and then the right side.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ELECTRICITY SURGES THROUGH THE BODY OF THE YOUNG MAN. HIS}
<ACTION>__{BODY CONTORTS. HE SCREAMS. The lights DIM and CRACKLE.}
<LOC>__{INT. TORTURE ROOM #1}
<ACTION>__{CLOSE ON - The light bulb DULLS.   The screams of the Young Man echo through the room. The Young Woman closes her eyes. Takes SEVERAL FAST BREATHS then... MUSTERS every ounce of strength in her body and... Her right hand TREMBLES... The Young Woman GRIMACES, in unbelievable agony, but then... HER RIGHT HAND INCHES UP THE IRON SPIKE. Slowly and painfully. PIECES OF BLOOD, SKIN and BONE cling to spike as the hand moves up. The light bulb returns again to normal.   The screams stop. The Young Woman gives a final hard push and...   FREES HER RIGHT HAND. Blood pours from the wound. No time to waste. She turns her attention, strength to her left hand... ever-so-slowly (and painfully) it moves.}
<LOC>__{INT.   TORTURE ROOM #2}
<ACTION>__{CLOSE ON - The jumper cable attaches to the metal and... ELECTRICITY SURGES THROUGH THE YOUNG MAN'S body. HE SCREAMS.}
<LOC>__{INT.   CABIN - TORTURE ROOM #1}
<ACTION>__{The Young Woman's left hand POPS free.    Blood oozes out. OFF SCREEN: SCREAMS FROM THE YOUNG MAN. She sits up, goes for the gag, but her fingers cramp in pain. Finally, she unties the knot, removes the gag. She coughs, tries to muffle the noise best she can. The SCREAMS STOP.   Lights return to normal. Half way free. She goes for the ropes at her ankles, unties them, slides off the table. She grabs a couple rags, ties them around her palm's wounds.}
<LOC>__{INT.   HALLWAY/ TORTURE ROOM #2}
<ACTION>__{The Young Woman opens the door, checks to see if the coast is clear. It is. We're at the end of a long, dark hallway (more like a tunnel, really). There are two more doors in the hall, one in front of her another to her right. The door across from her is slightly ajar... YOUNG WOMAN'S POV THRU DOOR - The Young Man dangles from the chains. Suddenly, the Concealed Figure appears between the door and the Young Man. The Young Woman retreats, but realizes the Concealed Figure has his back to her. THE YOUNG MAN sees past the Figure, LOCKS EYES with the Young Woman. No hope for himself, his eyes say: Save yourself. The Young Woman fights back tears, mouths the words "I Love you". She carefully opens the door to her right, REVEAL a rickety set of wooden steps. She heads up, just as... LIGHTS FLICKER.     OFF SCREEN: The Young Man SCREAMS again. The Young Woman quickens her pace. The SCREAMS drown out any sound, until... just before she touches THE TOP STEP... The lights return to NORMAL.       The Young Man STOPS screaming. The place goes silent. The Young Woman's foot TOUCHES THE STEP...       A LOUD CREAK RINGS OUT. The Young Woman FREEZES. TORTURE ROOM #2-- The Concealed Figure TURNS towards the sound. HALLWAY, STAIRS-- The Young Woman holds her breath.       Did he hear her? TORTURE ROOM #2-- A STEEL AXE/SICKLE hybrid (a scary, handmade invention), rusted, save for the razor sharp edge, sticks in a nearby wooden horse. The Concealed Figure SNATCHES the weapon.}

<ACTION>__{SARAH races through the thick forest. Her bare, bloody feet and legs stomping over the hard dirt, branches, shrubs, anything in her way. Not too far behind... THE CONCEALED FIGURE... (the majority of him still hidden) follows her. WEAPON IN HAND. SARAH... pushes through some thick brush, but... trips, falls. She SCREAMS IN PAIN, grabs her foot, notices... A LARGE GASH ACROSS THE BOTTOM. Sarah turns, hears... THE CONCEALED FIGURE.. approaches in the distance. SARAH... wills herself up, limp/runs away.}
<LOC>__{EXT.   FOREST - CLEARING/CLIFF - SUNSET}
<ACTION>__{Sarah exits the thick woods to discover, to her horror... SHE STANDS AT THE EDGE OF A CLIFF, takes a peek over the side... SARAH'S POV - JAGGED ROCKS and a small STREAM at the bottom,}
<LOC>__{200 feet below. A WATERFALL flows steadily nearby.}
<ACTION>__{Before Sarah can fully digest the situation... THE CONCEALED FIGURE exits the forest, SPINS THE WEAPON in his hand. Anticipating its use. Sarah FREEZES in her spot. Breaths get shorter, heavier. Her eyes dart in every direction. What to do? The Concealed Figure TAKES ONE STEP FORWARD and... SARAH JUMPS OFF THE CLIFF. Rather that fate than the other. The Concealed Figure walks up to the edge, looks over... AT THE BOTTOM... Sarah's dead body lays twisted and bloody among the rocks. The waterfall crashes next to her. BLOOD mixes with the water turning it a deep RED. CUE TITLE: TIMBER FALLS...}

And now, is supposedly seated next to Satan, his soul burning in hell forever for this sin. But I don't believe that's the case. I have my own theory. The death of Jesus was predicted thousands of years before Judas ever came along. And for the prophecy to be fulfilled, Jesus had to die. If he didn't, the gates of heaven couldn't be opened for mankind. I don't think, for an instant, Judas wanted to be the one, but... someone had to. Judas helped Jesus, so Jesus could die for our sins. Save us all. And I believe at this moment... Judas is in heaven, despite his sin, because it led to the greater good.}
