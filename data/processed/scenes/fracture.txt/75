<L>__{interior willy's apartment very late that night}
<A>__{willy stands over crime scene photos and diagrams spread out on his narrow futon. "walking the scene" again, on paper. the whole apartment is an array of law books, notes, exhibits, marked up depositions. he's staring at evidence he's already stared at a hundred times. he grinds the palms of his hands into his eye sockets, a dull moan rising into a yell as he sweeps everything off his bed in a storm of paper throwing books tearing up printouts pulling out drawers, emptying them, smashing them on the desk yelling in a frenzy until his throat is hoarse, his shabby garage apartment is trashed, and he's sitting, exhausted, in his chair. there's a knock on the door. willy frowns, checking the clock: it's two thirty a.m. he goes to open it revealing nunally, standing in the darkness, a haunted shadow of the boyish confident cop we met making love to jennifer crawford.}

<D>__{it's done. in the tool shed: taped to the blade, inside the lawn mower.}
<A>__{before willy can say anything nunally walks away. willy doesn't move. watching the tormented cop disappear down the alley.}
