<L>__{interior caesar's apartment day}
<A>__{like corky, violet can hear the beating. she is trying to block it out but cannot. standing at the bar, she runs the blender, grinding ice cubes, trying to drown out the sounds of the bathroom. the bathroom door opens.}
<C>__{johnnie}
<D>__{prick! i can go all night! all night!}
<A>__{caesar steps out, shutting the door, masking the sounds behind him. violet moves toward him.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{caesar, i'm leaving.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{what? oh, come on, i didn't use one of the good towels.}
<A>__{the door opens again as someone else steps out.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{caesar, i'm serious. this is too much. i have to get out of here.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{why? 'cause you know him?}
<A>__{she nods.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{you women are so fucking sensitive.}
<A>__{he takes hold of her.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{but i don't want you to go. i like you here. you know this isn't easy for me, either.}
<A>__{he embraces her. over his shoulder she sees mickey malnano in the hallway, staring at her. he is an older man, hair graying, built like a fireplug. sinewy mass strains at his brooks brothers suit.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{now why don't you go watch some tv or something?}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{are you okay, violet?}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{mickey, why is johnnie here? you know how i feel about that fucking psycho.}
<A>__{mickey continues to stare at violet, who looks up at him with her big doe eyes.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{caesar, didn't i tell you to get something?}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{sure, mickey. sure.}
<A>__{he goes to the kitchen. mickey moves closer to violet, lifting her chin the way a father would do to his little girl.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{you shouldn't have to see this. why don't you get out of here? go for a walk.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{caesar wants me to stay.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{don't worry about caesar. i will handle caesar. you just get out of here, okay?}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{thanks, mickey.}
<A>__{caesar returns from the kitchen. he is holding a pair of tin snips. mickey takes them.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{thanks, c. now let's end this thing.}
<A>__{violet watches them return to the bathroom.}
