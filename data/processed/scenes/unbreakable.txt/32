<A>__{a poorly lit changing room. a row of metallic lockers sits against one wall. a bench splits the room. a brown folding table with dunkin donuts boxes and bagels on it is crammed in the corner. a puke colored concrete floor sets the tone. david and three other large men are changing out of their street clothes. they all put on the same yellow short sleeve shirts. the same two words are written on all their backs... "stadium security" this ritual goes on without a word.}
