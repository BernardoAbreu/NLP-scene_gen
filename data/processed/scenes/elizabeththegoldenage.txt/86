<D>__{who are you to sit in judgement on me? by what authority do you condemn a queen? god alone has made me what i am. he is my only judge. raise your law above god's law, and what law remains? in your vanity and ignorance you set loose the monster of misrule. you know neither who you are nor what you do. but i know who i am. i die as i have lived trusting in the mercy of my god a queen.}
