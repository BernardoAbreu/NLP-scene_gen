<TRANS>__{FADE IN:}
<ACTION>__{Moving through a murky haze.  Dark blues and greens, shafts of prismed purple.  A pale shard appears in the distance. Gliding closer, a group of tiny fish dart before the camera. We're UNDERWATER.  Arriving at the form, it finally sharpens into focus.  It's a WOMAN'S BODY submerged in dark water, arms floating lazily at her side.  The face is obscured by flowing hair.  All that is visible is a pair of COLD, STARING GREEN EYES, which blink closed...}
<TRANS>__{MORPH TO:}
<ACTION>__{...then open as BLUE EYES, as a DIFFERENT FACE emerges from water.  CLAIRE SPENCER awakens from this unsettling dream in her bathtub.  She pivots the large BRASS SHOWER HEAD (the kind that moves up and down on a pipe) off to one side, reaches toward her feet and we hear the sound of a plug being pulled.}
<LOC>__{INT.  BATHROOM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{A HAZY SHAPE-- accompanied by a whirring sound. A steam covered mirror is cleared with a BLOW DRYER.  Claire starts to come into focus.  The dryer stops.  She presses the red G.F.I. button on the socket.  ZAP!  A big blue spark shoots out.  Claire pulls her hand back...and the dryer starts whirring again. She clears the mirror and replaces the dryer on a hook.  She regards herself in the mirror, and attractive, elegant- looking woman around forty. Claire traces a finger along a small but noticeable SCAR above her left eye, then slowly drops the hand to her cheek, as if confirming her existence.}
<LOC>__{INT.  CLAIRE'S HOUSE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Claire, now dressed, presses her face against a door, listening for the sounds of stirring from within.  Silence. She quietly pushes open the door.}
<LOC>__{INT.  ROOM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Claire makes her way past half-filled boxes and duffels to a window, then pulls the curtains to reveal: A LOVELY, WOODED LAKE.  It couldn't be more picturesque.  A}
<LOC>__{24' SAILBOAT is moored at the dock and an OLD STONE}
<ACTION>__{LIGHTHOUSE sits on a point across the lake. The sunlight motivates an unconscious groan from A FIGURE still shrouded by covers. Claire sits beside the sleeping form.  She scans the room briefly, taking in a Greenpeace flag and a picture of a tomboyish ten year-old girl at camp. She gently pulls back the covers and peers down at the same face, now a waifish, pretty seventeen year-old, with chopped hair and tiny nose ring.  Claire leans over and inhales the sleeping scent of her only daughter, CAITLIN.  She places her hand on a cheek.  The girl's eyelids flutter softly.}

<ACTION>__{Through a stand of trees over a HIGH WOODEN FENCE, A YOUNG COUPLE is in the midst of a heated argument next door. Claire watches as the HUSBAND, a large imposing man with an unruly shock of red hair, snarls at his wife across the hood of their huge old Buick.  She tries to get a glimpse of the woman, but all that's visible is THE BACK OF HER BLOND HEAD. A TAN, SINEWY ARM encircles Claire's waist.  She lets out a small gasp as a hand closes on her breast.  It's Claire's husband, DR. NORMAN SPENCER, nibbling gently at her neck. He's older than she, pushing fifty, with silver streaks beginning to permeate the shaggy mop of hair that makes him look more like a preppy rocker or a lacrosse coach than the prominent academic that he is.  Claire, however, can't take her eyes off the scene below.}

She moves quickly to the bureau, not wanting to spend much time in here, then grabs a TINY BLACK TOP from the pile, and drops it into a drawer.  She's just about to close it, when something catches her eye. CLAIRE'S POV She drops the laundry and slowly pulls a tattered, old JUILLIARD T-SHIRT with a very seventies logo from the drawer. Claire gazes around the room, which is a reliquary of Caitlin's recently concluded childhood; PICTURES, TROPHIES,}

Claire glances around at several hastily unpacked boxes and sees propped in the corner...THE CELLO CASE.  She gazes at other photos. -- Claire in her wedding dress, Norman beside her in a tux with a very wide bow-tie. -- Claire and Norman in front of a UNIVERSITY BUILDING.

She collapses into a lawn chair as the tears begin to subside.  Suddenly, she hears something coming from next door. She cocks her head and attempts to make out the sound.  It is, ironically, the sound of a WOMAN CRYING.  Claire makes her way over to the fence.  The women's sobbing becomes more plaintive and fevered. She places her face against the prickly, vine covered fence and tries to peer through the crack.  All she can make out is A DARK BLUE BLUR that seems to be rocking.
