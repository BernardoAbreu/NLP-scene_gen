<A>__{the knight and taupin are panting heavily. the knight goes low. taupin blocks. the knight comes overhead quickly. taupin misjudges and the blade slices deep into his shoulder and chest. the impact knocks him flat on his back. the knight looks down on his wounded prey. a screech of brakes from outside the monument. two officers are coming up the steps.}

<P>__{(hoarse)}
<D>__{don't.}
<A>__{taupin curls in a spasm of pain. moran moves closer. the knight lies face down, blood oozing from exit wounds over his heart. he isn't breathing. moran bends over slowly to see the knight's face.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{stop. you don't understand.}
<A>__{the knight suddenly rolls over and plants his sword into moran's chest. the pistol discharges against a far wall. taupin crawls for the knight. moran's mouth opens but no sound escapes. the knight, blood pouring from his mouth and nose, thrusts deeper then retracts quickly. moran slides off the sword dead. taupin cuts hard against the knight's chest. the knight gags in surprise and crumples. taupin cuts again, then puts the blade against the knight's gurgling throat.}

<D>__{my god.}
<A>__{taupin bolts up and looks at her without seeing.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{conor.}

<C>__{knight}
<D>__{and now you know.}
<A>__{the eyes roll up into the skull. the face slackens. the hulking mass standing beside brenna sways, the collapses to the ground.}

<L>__{exterior washington mall day}
<A>__{brenna sits on the expanse of grass throwing scraps to a group of wild park cats. a shadow covers her face. she looks up. it is taupin. something has changed him. his face is less cynical. more vulnerable. more human. he sits down on the grass beside her.}

<P>__{(after a moment)}
