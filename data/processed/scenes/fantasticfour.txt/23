<A>__{a wake of turbulence from the cloud hits ben, making it harder to maneuver. the cloud's tendrils snake toward him.}

<A>__{sue glares at victor. his lack of compassion shocks her.}

<D>__{not until ben is back inside!}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{it's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.}

<C>__{victor}
<D>__{raising the shields.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{you can't leave them out there.}
<A>__{sue glares with as much contempt as her face can muster.}
<C>__{victor}

<A>__{with one final glare, she bolts from the room.}
