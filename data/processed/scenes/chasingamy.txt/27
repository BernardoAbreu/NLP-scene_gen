<D>__{why are we stopping?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{because i can't take it.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{can't take what?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i love you.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you love me.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i love you. and not in a friendly way, although i think we're great friends. and not in a misplaced affection, puppy dog way, although i'm sure that's what you'll call it. and it's not because you're unattainable. i love you. very simple, very truly. you're the epitome of every attribute and quality i've ever looked for in another person. i know you think of me as just a friend and crossing that line is the furthest thing from an option you'd ever consider. but i can't do this any longer. i can't stand next to you without wanting to hold you. i can't look into your eyes without feeling that longing you only read about in trashy romance novels. i can't talk to you without wanting to express my love for everything you are. i know this will probably queer our friendship no pun intended but i had to say it, because i've never felt this before, and i like who i am because of it. and if bringing it to light means we can't hang out anymore, then that hurts me. but i couldn't allow another day to go by without getting it out there, regardless of the outcome, which by the look on your face is to be the inevitable shoot down. and i will accept that but i know some part of you is hesitating for a moment, and if there is a moment of hesitation, that means you feel something too. all i ask is that you not suppress that at least for ten minutes and try to dwell in it before you dismiss it. there isn't another soul on this fucking planet who's ever made me the person i am when i'm with you, and i would risk this friendship for the chance to take it to the next plateau. because it's there between you and me. you can't deny that. and even if we never speak again after tonight, please know that i'm forever changed because of you and what you've meant to me, which while i do appreciate it i'd never need a painting of birds bought at a diner to remind me of.}
