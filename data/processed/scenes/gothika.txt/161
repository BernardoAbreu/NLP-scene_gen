<L>__{interior county station holding cell moments later}
<A>__{miranda's eyes snap open at the sound of deadbolts sliding unlocked. hopeful. could this be rachel? a looming figure appears at the door. doesn't bother to shut it. stares at her silently for a long while. and so begins a claustrophobic cat and mouse game:}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{how did you know?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{you tell me.}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{this isn't one of your word association games, doctor. did douglas tell you that night?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{why wait this long if he had?}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{maybe it's your amnesia. maybe you blocked it out.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{maybe. but it seems to me that it's vital you know for sure.}
<A>__{he studies her. takes a step towards her. miranda responds by stepping back. a slow motion semicircle, if you will. she eyes the open door. tempted.}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{you think me and doug are monsters. that this was all a carefully laid out plan with those girls. but it wasn't that at all. you do things sometimes and you're not sure why you did them. then you realize you can live with them and so can everyone else. life goes on.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{if you're looking for forgiveness, you came to the wrong place.}
<A>__{she's stalling, trying to keep him talking and he knows it.}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{one thing about fear is it makes people say the dumbest things.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{be that as it may, you're afraid too because you know killing me won't solve your problems.}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{my only problem is you.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{what about parsons? and peter? they know. and that girl in the hospital will never forget your face. you miscalculated, now you pay.}
<A>__{patience tested, he suddenly whacks her across the face.}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{i hate a bad bluffer.}
<A>__{she makes a big effort to hide how much that stung.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i sure hope that felt good because you can't afford too many more signs of struggle. can you?}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{go ahead, hit me back. it's what you want.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{no, that's what you want me to do.}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{back to profiling, huh? your thought process is completely transparent.}
<A>__{and now miranda briefly takes the reins of the conversation. analyst and patient in session. echoing her opening scene with chloe.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{so we're even. you left that door open so i'd try and run, it's what you get off on, isn't it?}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{i guess we'll find out.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{and yet you have to make me look like a suicide. with what, your belt?}
<P>__{(off his shrug)}
<D>__{how would i get access to a belt?}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{trust me, prisoners hang themselves with just about anything.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i don't think that's going to satisfy you. you won't be able to do this clean. you have too much guilt inside.}
<A>__{smack! another slap across the face. miranda's knees buckle. but she remains standing. her lip trembles.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{you're losing grasp of the situation. it was different with those girls. i bet all they did was cry and scream.}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{don't worry, you'll scream.}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{take off your shirt.}
<A>__{this throws her off. she shoots a quick glance at the door.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{aren't i a little old for you?}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{take it off.}
<A>__{she hesitates. he draws his gun, tired. removes the safety.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{that's for show. you know you can't shoot me.}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{but i can smash your teeth out and make it look like you bashed your head against the wall. now shut up, take off your goddamn shirt and pull off your bra.}
<A>__{miranda is petrified now. running out of ways to hide it.}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{today, doctor.}
<A>__{in a sudden move, miranda shoves the chair at him and bolts out the door. the sheriff doesn't move to stop her.}
