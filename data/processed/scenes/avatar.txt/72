<A>__{tracking with jake as he gazes about him in growing wonder. he touches leaves as he passes, watching the bioluminescence shiver through them. jake looks down as they cross a bed of purple moss which reacts to the pressure of their footsteps. rings of green light, like ripples on a pond, expand outward from each footfall. exploding rings of light where his feet touch down. dream like, surreal beauty. wide on them as they run over a large root, across a mirror like pool at the base of a waterfall. jake follows neytiri, running along a raised root trunk.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<A>__{jake hears whoosh whoosh and snaps a look as a bolo flies at him, spinning end for end and shwhap!! tangles around his legs. he topples off the root and crashes into the foliage below. jake untangles himself, getting up to run just as several na'vi riders thunder toward him. they are riding direhorses six legged, armor skinned alien clydesdales. we see that the riders' queues are connected to the horses' long moth like antennae a neural link with which they can command the horse, leaving hands free for weapons. the riders aim bows and spears at jake as they approach. jake turns to bolt, but na'vi hunters melt out of the shadows, weapons aimed blocking his retreat. neytiri drops to the ground next to jake and confronts the lead rider. she shouts sharply in na'vi }
