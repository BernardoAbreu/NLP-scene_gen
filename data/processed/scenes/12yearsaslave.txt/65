<A>__{the groups of slaves and chickasaws are now intermingled. they "break bread" actually they work on the carcass of the deer which is now roasting over a large fire. as well the group share a smoke on a pipe. one of the chickasaws is playing a tune on an "indian fiddle." the chickasaws perform a customary dance; trotting after each other, and giving utterance to a guttural, sing song noise. the slaves enjoy the respite from work, solomon particularly taken by the music...if not entirely enthralled by it. after a bit, solomon rights himself and heads from the group.}
