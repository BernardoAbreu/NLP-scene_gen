<A>__{moving through a tunnellike entrance, luke cautiously approaches the reactor room. he ignites his sword and moves into the room and toward a large window as vader enters. luke raises his sword and moves forward to attack. behind luke a large piece of machinery detaches itself from the wall and comes smashing forward toward his back. luke turns and cuts it in half just as another machine comes hurtling at him. using the force, luke manages to deflect it and send it flying as if it had hit an invisible shield. a large pipe detaches and comes flying at luke. he deflects it. sparking wires pull out of the wall and begin to whip at the youth. small tools and equipment come flying at him. bombardment from all sides, luke does his best to deflect everything, but soon he is bloodied and bruised. finally, one machine glances off his and goes flying out the large window. a fierce wind blows into the room, unmoving, stands the dark, rocklike figure of vader. a piece of machinery hits luke and he is knocked out of the window.}
