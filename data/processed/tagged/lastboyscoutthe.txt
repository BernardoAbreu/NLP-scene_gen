<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{no, jimmy. it's not the cops.}
<A>__{working quickly, hallenbeck tapes the bomb to the inside of the truck lid. slams it shut. turns, facing the new arrivals. the men wear tailored suits with matching ties. one is tall and lean. the other is a bruiser, short and stout. they both have the seasoned look of professional mob hitters. the taller man speaks, gun held rock steady.}
<C>__{tall man}
<D>__{good evening, gentlemen. bit late for a stroll, don't you think?}

<D>__{perhaps we can dispense with the fun and games now, yes?}
<A>__{jimmy rushes forward, snarling. the beretta swivels. jimmy stops, the gun aimed at his gut.}

<A>__{hallenbeck is already moving, pitching to one side, throwing himself and jimmy down the hillside. the night lights up like a sunburst. a tower of fire... climbs up and outward from the car. the trunk lid is blown fifty feet in the air. the tires are pulped. glass sprays for fifty yards in every direction. and, most importantly: both hitmen are engulfed in flame. sound. fury. flames, rolling skyward. tinkle of raining glass. bits of falling metal. all in all, a helluva blast, and meanwhile:}
<B>__{jimmy and joe}
<A>__{continue to careen down the hillside. bouncing like rag puppets. out of control. lurch to stop at the bottom. covered head to toe with dirt. bruised. bloody. alive. they lie side by side, sucking air until they both hear an odd noise: the sound of crumpling metal. the sound is getting louder. they both crane their necks in time to see the flaming car, tumbling end over end coming down the hill. heading straight for them.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{jesus fucking christ!}
<A>__{they both dive for cover, out of the way. barely make it. the car plows past them in a shower of dirt. crumpling. heaving. spitting fire. finally slams to a halt against a palm tree. burns. the night is filled with shouts and curses. the sound of doors opening. the crackle of flames.}
