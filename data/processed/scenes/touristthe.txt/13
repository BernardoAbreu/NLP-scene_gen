<L>__{interior interpol central briefing room, paris evening}
<A>__{behind the ornate, 17th century doors is a high tech amphitheater style briefing room. all glass and steel. suited bureaucrats and officers from all over europe listen to ackerman as he leads the meeting from the podium.}
<C>__{ackerman}
<D>__{our target's name is alexander pearce. british citizen, born in london into an ordinary middle class family. the only thing remarkable about his childhood was a preternatural gift for numbers.}
<A>__{ackerman clicks a slide projected on a large screen behind him: a fuzzy photo of a british schoolboy with a shy grin.}
<C>__{ackerman }
<D>__{which he used to hack into a computer and fix the test results his final year at school.}
<A>__{jean luc (french interpol liaison) looks up skeptically.}
<C>__{jean luc}
<D>__{your mastermind couldn't pass his exams on his own?}
<C>__{ackerman}
<D>__{he didn't fix his test scores; he fixed the scores for all the girls in the class. it made him very popular.}
<A>__{a ripple of laughter through the group.}
<C>__{ackerman }
<P>__{(severely)}
<D>__{what started as school pranks eventually became something much more serious. after a year in the training program at goldman sachs, he decided that gambling suited him better than working for a living. that, in turn, involved him with some rather unsavory people and ultimately led him to put his financial genius to work in his true calling: money laundering.}
<A>__{quinn is the swiss interpol liaison. he speaks with the crisp accent of a man who is fluent in several languages.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{you've assembled quite a task force to catch a common money launderer, mr. ackerman.}
<C>__{ackerman}
<D>__{there is nothing common about alexander pearce. quiet simply, he has turned money laundering into an art form. his greatest innovation: the false lawsuit.}
<A>__{he clicks through a series of flashy powerpoint slides illustrating pearce's financial dealings.}
<C>__{ackerman }
<D>__{pearce sets up two companies: one is a casino in arizona for example and the other is a shell company in the cayman islands.}
<C>__{ackerman }
<D>__{the cayman islands company files a lawsuit against the casino, claiming copyright infringement or some other complainterior they "succeed" in winning the case and the casino pays the shell company an enormous settlement.}
<C>__{quinn}
<P>__{(understanding)}
<D>__{the money travels from america to the cayman islands...}
<C>__{ackerman}
<D>__{yes, but now the money is legal.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{not quite legal. the i.r.s. has been cheated out of the revenue.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we calculate that mr. pearce's tax bill currently stands at $743.7 million dollars.}
<A>__{jean luc leans toward his colleague.}
<C>__{jean luc}
<P>__{(whispers in french)}
<D>__{that explains what the american harridan is doing here.}
<A>__{ms. jones gives him a glacial stare.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{exactement, monsieur.}
<A>__{jean luc reddens. oops. apparently not every american fits the stereotype.}
<C>__{ackerman}
<D>__{mr. pearce has some other debts as well. most of you will recognize ivan demidov...}
<A>__{click: a photo of a balding russian oligarch emerging from a limo.}
<C>__{ackerman }
<D>__{...pearce laundered over a billion dollars for demidov. at some point pearce decided he'd rather steal from demidov than help him steal.}
<C>__{ackerman }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{given demidov's ties to organized crime, i'd say that was a mistake.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(clears her throat)}
<D>__{the u.s. government is not participating in an investigation of a member of the russian parliament; our target is alexander pearce.}
<A>__{ackerman smiles coolly at her.}
<C>__{ackerman}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{an interpol officer from germany raises his hand.}
<C>__{german interpol}
<D>__{has mr. pearce ever been in custody?}
<A>__{ackerman looks down for a moment, as if it pains him to answer.}
<C>__{ackerman}
<D>__{almost.}
