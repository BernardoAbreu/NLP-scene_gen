<C>__{charlene}
<D>__{you slimy piece of shit. what a joke.}
<C>__{marciano}
<D>__{you told me you want out from under? you're scared to death of neil. you wanted out? this is out!}
<C>__{charlene}

<C>__{marciano}
<D>__{you dump broad! how'd i get into this?}
<C>__{farina}
<D>__{hey, hey! go easy on the lady!}
<C>__{marciano}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{farina}
<D>__{you heard me. she had a rough ride.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{go mix her a drink. cabinet above the sink.}
<C>__{marciano}
<D>__{fuck her.}
<C>__{farina}
<D>__{get the fuck in there!}
<A>__{marciano does. charlene seems to soften and relax and take satisfaction at marciano's put down.}
<C>__{farina}
<P>__{(continuing; soft)}
<D>__{he's right. and you know it. you think you'd be betraying chris?}
<C>__{charlene}
<P>__{(right to his face)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{farina}
<D>__{well, you're right. you would be. but if you don't betray chris, you betray dominick. because he becomes an orphan when you go to prison as an accessory 'cause you got no living parents to take him. then he ends up state raised and fucked for life. your son dominick's innocent. he didn't choose a life like that. chris did.}
<A>__{charlene rises and crosses to a bedroom and looks in the door presumably at dominick.}
<C>__{farina}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{give up chris. you get off clean. do it for your kid.}
<A>__{charlene sits shell shocked dressed in black with white face and red lipstick. marciano re enters with a drink for her. charlene looks towards the bedroom containing dominick, then nods her head "yes." farina dials a number.}
<C>__{farina}
<P>__{(continuing; into cellular phone)}
<D>__{vincent. it's me. we're set here. she'll make the call.}
<A>__{charlene dials a number into the regular phone. then:}
<C>__{charlene}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{i'm going to give you an address of where i'm staying. could you get it to chris?}
