<L>__{interior basement. night.}
<A>__{kieran and kym lie entangled in the basement, sharing a cigarette, disheveled. the floor of this entire section of the basement is now covered with all of the carefully arranged mattresses and futons that were stacked down here before. all of kym's mismatched bags have been moved down here too. there's a little lamp there now as well but it's not on. only one of the small, cobwebby windows casts a dappled light onto the scene.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{that was such a set up.}
<C>__{kieran}
<D>__{she probably didn't realize she was doing it.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{ha! she's such an operator. now i'm the bad guy again. or still.}
<C>__{kieran}
<D>__{they're lucky to have you.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{thank you! otherwise they'd have to pay attention to their own suspicious lives. nobody actually wants me to actually change, you know. what would they obsess about? i'm like a blessing.}
<C>__{kieran}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{no argument from me.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{dad had an actual "blueprint for rehabilitative success" at my last intervention. on graph paper. he goes all out with the response, my dad.}
<C>__{kieran}
<D>__{not unlike this great nation in which we live.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{meanwhile an ex heterosexual ex boy friend of mine actually rang the door once and tells my mother, "kym is sitting in her apartment? with the shades drawn? doing all this heroin and cocaine? and i think she's going to, like, die?" and mom smiles and says "thank you" like he was speaking in sanskrit.}
<C>__{kieran}
<D>__{you can't actually speak in sanskrit.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{exactly! i nodded out into the poached salmon at dad's wedding two years ago and he told carol he thought it was jet lag.}
<C>__{kieran}
<D>__{i did that in soup once. it made such a mess.}
