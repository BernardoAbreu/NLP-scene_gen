<L>__{interior kate's laboratory office morning}
<A>__{the doctors enter kate's office and closes the door.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{hi.}
<P>__{(the doctors remain silent)}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<A>__{there is a long pause. slowly kate realizes the doctors are on to her. she puts down her pen.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{so you know.}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{we had to go through your computer to access information. your calculations have been verified and the final course has been set. leopold goes back a week from friday 1:17 a.m.}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{how long were you going to keep it a secret, kate?}
<C>__{dr. drake}
<D>__{were you even going to tell us at all?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i'm not sure.}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{not sure? what can you be thinking? you can't alter the course of history and assume everything will be okay. it won't be. he has his own destiny to fulfill in his own time.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{you don't understand.}
<C>__{dr. drake}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{he's going back, kate.}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{it's over.}
<A>__{kate nods. the doctors slowly leave the room and close the door. just the sound of the clock ticking. kate sits at her desk very still.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{no... no, no, no.}
