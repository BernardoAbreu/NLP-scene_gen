<A>__{andy exits the theater and freezes in his tracks. two dark figures loom in the corridor, blocking his path. rooster and pete. andy turns back and runs right into bogs. instant bear hug. the sisters are on him like a flash. they kick a door open and drag him into }
<B>__{the projection booth}
<A>__{ where they confront the startled projectionist, an old con blinking at them through thick bifocals.}
<C>__{bogs}
<D>__{take a walk.}
<C>__{projectionist}
<D>__{i have to change reels.}
<C>__{bogs}
<D>__{i said fuck off.}

<C>__{bogs}
<D>__{ain't you gonna scream?}
<A>__{andy sighs, cocks his head at the projector.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{they'd never hear me over that. let's get this over with.}
<A>__{seemingly resigned, andy turns around, leans on the rewind bench and curls his fingers around a full 1.000 foot reel of 35mm film. rooster licks his lips, pushes past the others.}
<C>__{rooster}
<D>__{me first.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{andy whips the reel of film around in a vicious arc, smashing it into rooster's face and bouncing him off the wall.}
<C>__{rooster}
<D>__{fuck! shit! he broke my nose!}
<A>__{andy fights like hell, but is soon overpowered and forced to his knees. bogs steps to andy, pulls out an awl with a vicious eight inch spike, gives him a good long look at it.}
<C>__{bogs}
<D>__{now i'm gonna open my fly, and you're gonna swallow what i give you to swallow. and when you d mine, you gonna swallow rooster's. you done broke his nose, so he ought to have somethin' to show for it.}

<C>__{andy}
<D>__{okay. but you should know that sudden serious brain injury causes the victim to bite down. hard.}
<P>__{(faint smile)}
<D>__{in fact, i understand the bite reflex is so strong the victim's jaws have to be pried open with a crowbar.}
<A>__{the sisters consider this carefully. the film runs out of the projector, flapping on the reel. the screen goes white.}
<C>__{bogs}
<D>__{you little fuck.}
<A>__{andy gets a bootheel in the face. the sisters start kicking and beating the living shit out of him with anything they can get their hands on. in the theater, the convicts are chanting and clapping for the movie to come back on.}

<D>__{bogs didn't put anything in andy's mouth, and neither did his friends. what they did do is beat him within an inch of his life...}
