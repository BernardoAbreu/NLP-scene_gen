<A>__{the joker's van, bearing the monarch playing card logo. two armed goons lean against the hood. they watch as the elevator opens and an ordinary fellow in a suit steps out. bruce pulls car keys from his pocket and strolls past the thugs, head down, whistling. as he walks around the van, his hand brushes against it leaving a magnetized homing device, almost too tiny to notice, stuck to the fender. he walks another six paces, then stops short. he feels around in all his pockets, making a big show of having forgotten something.}

<D>__{oh, hell!}
<A>__{the goons eye him curiously as he strides back toward the elevator. the doors are closing before it strikes them that something is amiss.}

<D>__{hey, boss, something's up. the elevator's working.}
