<A>__{lila looks pale and shaken. she smokes.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{for two weeks i holed myself up in a motel room. i didn't even know who i was. my world had crumbled. there is nothing that makes you feel dirtier than finally deciding to sell your soul and finding no buyers.}

<L>__{interior hotel room day}
<A>__{lila lies in bed watching tv. she is a mess. the room is a mess. the wig is off. there's hair sprouting on her face. the curtains are drawn. there is a knock at the door.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{no maid service! for god's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?}

<D>__{lila, it's rosie.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{go the fuck away, rosie.}
<C>__{rose }

<C>__{lila}
<D>__{rose, please go away.}
<C>__{rose }
<D>__{lila, i want to help you.}
<A>__{lila gets up, drags herself to the door, and opens it. rose stands there trying not to let it show how lousy lila looks.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{how'd you know where i was?}

<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(suddenly crying)}
<D>__{why didn't your brother tell you that nathan was having an affair?}
<A>__{rose holds lila, who hangs on her as she weeps.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i don't know, honey. i don't know. maybe he just didn't want to get involved.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{oh, rosie.}

<P>__{(cheerily)}
<D>__{free electrolysis, if you want it! we'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time.}
<A>__{lila mulls it over. she looks back at the hotel room. it's depressing. she sniffs in her snot.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{yeah. i gotta get myself together. i want to look good. if i'm gonna fuck with nathan, and i am, i want him to want to fuck me when i do it.}
