<L>__{exterior field day}
<A>__{from a distance, stern and schindler slowly walk a wasteland that lies between the rear of def and two other factories a radiator works and a box plant. stern's doing all the talking, in his usual quiet but persuasive manner. every so often, schindler, glancing from his own factory to the others, nods.}
<L>__{interior schindler's office day}
<A>__{the party pins the two other german businessmen wear are nothing compared to the elaborate thing in schindler's lapel. he sits at his desk sipping cognac, a large portrait of hitler hanging prominently on the wall behind him.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{unlike your radiators and your boxes my products aren't for sale on the open market. this company has only one client, the german army. and lately i've been having trouble fulfilling my obligations to my client. with your help, i hope the problem can be solved. the problem, simply, is space.}
<A>__{stern, who has been keeping a low profile, hands the gentlemen each a set of documents.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i'd like you to consider a proposal which i think you'll find equitable. i'd like you to think about it and get back to me as soon as }
<C>__{kuhnpast}
<D>__{excuse me do you really think this is appropriate?}
<A>__{the man glances to stern, and back to schindler, his look saying, this is wrong, having a jew present while we discuss business. if schindler catches his meaning, he doesn't admit it. kuhnpast almost sighs.}
<C>__{kuhnpast}
<D>__{i can appreciate your problem. if i had any space i could lease you, i would. i don't. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{hohne}
<D>__{me neither, sorry.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i don't want to lease your facilities, i want to buy them. i'm prepared to offer you fair market value. and to let you stay on, if you want, as supervisors.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{on salary.}
<A>__{there's a long stunned silence. the germans can't believe it. after the initial shock wears off, kuhnpast has to laugh.}
<C>__{kuhnpast}
<D>__{you've got to be kidding.}
<A>__{nobody is kidding.}
<C>__{kuhnpast}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{thanks for the drink.}
<A>__{he sets it down, gets up. hohne gets up. they return the documents to stern and turn to leave. they aren't quite out the door when schindler wonders out loud to stern:}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{you try to be fair to people, they walk out the door; i've never understood that. what's next?}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{christmas presents.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{ah, yes.}
<A>__{the businessmen slow, but don't look back into the room.}
