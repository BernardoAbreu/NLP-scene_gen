<L>__{exterior casa loma apartments morning}
<A>__{another goddamned day. a chill drizzle. the palm trees look forlorn.}
<B>__{at corner newsstand}
<A>__{jimmy buys a paper. trudges along ventura boulevard. huddled against the chill. sleek, black sedan slides to the curb in front of him. two men get out: one is pablo, who last we saw wielding a chainsaw in milo's snuff film; the other is an ugly piece of hired muscle who we'll call chet. the two men flank jimmy and walk alongside him. he looks up, startled.}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{good morning, jimmy.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{who are you, and how the fuck do you know my name?}
<C>__{chet}
<P>__{(frowns)}
<D>__{this is the guy? you sure it's the guy?}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{this is him.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{the kid with the million dollar arm?}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{shit. he don't look like much. i wouldn't pay no million dollars for this bozo.}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{neither will anyone else, anymore.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i'm growing whiskers here, guys. you got something to say, fucking say it.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{wow. tough guy stuff. must have caught it from his buddy hallenbeck.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{don't play dumb, shithead. you were with him last night at the club.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{mr. marcon sent us to teach you a lesson, jimmy. something about keeping your big coked up nose out of his fucking business.}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{get ready, kid. this one's an e ticket.}
<A>__{and, with that, they grab jimmy under the arms. carry him across the sidewalk to a plywood fence.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{please, guys, don't do this... jesus christ, i was just her boyfriend, i swear to god, please!}
<A>__{they toss jimmy over the fence.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{not a terrible fate, under normal circumstances. in this case, however a fifty foot drop... awaits him beyond the fence. a huge, looming pit dug into the earth. foundation for a new parking garage. jimmy plummets like a stone. under normal circumstances, he'd be dead. but since it rained last night, he's got three feet of water to land in. he hits with a splash. disappears beneath the water. surfaces, screaming in pain. thrashes in the muddy water, and only when he looks down does he notice the splintered bone jutting out of his skin at a crazy angle. his million dollar arm. his throwing arm. he clutches at cracked ribs, screaming:}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{oh, god, my arm, my fucking arm, oh jesus christ!!!}
<A>__{he kneels in the muddy water, rocking back and forth. long shot jimmy alone in the pit. huddled in a pool of muddy water. his screams of pain echo in the chill, morning air.}
