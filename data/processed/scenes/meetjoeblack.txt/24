<L>__{interior hallway outside library, parrish townhouse night}
<A>__{parrish moves deliberately down the hall, slows as he nears the doorway to the library. the door is open. he hesitates before he crosses the threshold, taking in as much as his eye can see, now tentatively, he enters.}
<L>__{interior library, parrish townhouse night}
<A>__{a beautiful, classic room, areas of dim, warm light, club chairs, books reaching to the ceiling, a rolling library ladder, a weathered dictionary on a stand, a model boat carved of bone set into the stacks which are separated from the reading area by a seven foot high partition of obscured glass. parrish, poised in the doorway, looks around, nothing in sight.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{anyone here?}
<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{i said is anyone here?!}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{quiet down.}
<A>__{parrish is startled, he shrinks backward for a moment, his eyes searching the room for the voice, the timbre and pitch of which is exactly what he has heard before. there is the sense that someone is there but parrish cannot see him, and he does not dare look.}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{where are you?}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{i'm here.}
<A>__{now a flicker of a shadow from behind a corner of the obscured glass, the section of the room most distant from parrish, there is a shape. something is there.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what is this, a joke, right? some kind of elaborate practical joke? at my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the class president's hotel room and }
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{quiet.}
<A>__{parrish falls silent, something in the sound and tone of the voice muting him. he takes a step backwards.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i i uh }
<A>__{the shape moves, makes itself more visible. although still diffused by the glass, the shape has definition, a person, a man, his features are not yet distinguishable, but he is there all right.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{the great bill parrish at a loss for words? the man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear shaped tones }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what the hell is this? who are you?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, i've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest. call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you.}
<A>__{parrish struggles to make sense of what he is hearing.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i want to have a look around before i take you.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{'take me'...? where?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{it requires competence, wisdom, experience all those things they say about you in testimonials and you're the one.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{'the one' to do what?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{show me around. be my guide. and in return, you get...}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(breathless)}
<D>__{get what?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{time.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what the hell are you talking about?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{watch it!}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i'm sorry }
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{in return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, i'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that i stay interested.}
<A>__{parrish squints, trying to make sense of what is happening.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{...'yes'.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{yes what?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{'yes' is the answer to your ques tion.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what question?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{bill. come on. the question. the question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning. the question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{the 'question' }
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(urging)}
<D>__{yes, bill. the question.}
<A>__{after a moment.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{...am i going to die?}
<A>__{the figure who is the voice takes a step forward now, no longer obscured by the glass he comes into the light, re vealing himself to be the young man seen previously in the coffee shop, but there is a change; he seems odd, off center, not handsome but terrifyingly beautiful.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{a moment, parrish beside himself. he cannot bring himself to speak, finally:}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{am i dreaming this?}
<P>__{(another moment)}
<D>__{are you a dream?}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{i am not a dream.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you're coming to 'take me'. what is that? who the hell are you?}
<A>__{the young man steps closer to parrish, his face is inches from a shaking, sweating parrish's face, the young man daring parrish to identify him:}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you are ?}
<C>__{young man}
<P>__{(urging again)}
<D>__{'...yes '}
<A>__{parrish turns away. but the young man, spectacularly, is in front of him again.}
<C>__{young man }
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{who am i?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{...death.}
<A>__{parrish is shocked, stunned, terrified at the word, by what he has comprehended. he surveys the young man who, at this moment, actually seems bewildered by his effect.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{you're death?}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{death!}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{that's me.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you're not death. you're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{the jacket and the pair of pants came with the body i took. let me ask your opinion. do i blend in?}
<A>__{a hopelessly confused parrish does not respond for a moment.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you want me to be your guide ?}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{you fill the bill, bill.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i do?}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{how long will you be staying?}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{you should hope quite a while.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{and then ?}
<A>__{the young man nods, gently.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{it's... it's... over.}
<A>__{a long silence. parrish and the young man take each other in, the sense that now they understand each other. a sound at the door.}
<C>__{luisa }
<D>__{mr. parrish?}
<A>__{parrish does not hear her for the moment, luisa steps inside the library.}
<C>__{luisa }
<D>__{will the gentleman be staying for dinner, sir?}
<A>__{parrish ignores her at first, finally he looks at luisa then at the young man, then once more at both of them as if to verify the young man's presence has been acknowledged by luisa. the young man interjects:}
<C>__{young man}
<P>__{(to luisa)}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(a polite afterthought)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{luisa nods perfunctorily and exits. parrish is frozen, dumbfounded.}
<C>__{young man }
<P>__{(to parrish)}
<D>__{where is dinner?}
<A>__{parrish does not answer at first.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{this is crazy you're not going to eat dinner with us.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{bill, i am eating dinner with you. and your family. and that's what we're doing. it's not open for discussion. nothing is. don't you understand?}
<A>__{parrish is frightened by the response.}
<C>__{young man }
<D>__{good. now lead the way.}
<A>__{parrish hesitates, then obediently leads the young man out of the library, down a long hallway and across the foyer.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{excuse me? could i say something?}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{it just occurred to me }
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{speak up, please.}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{when i introduce you, if i say who you are, i don't think anyone will stay for dinner.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{then don't.}
