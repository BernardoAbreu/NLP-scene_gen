<P>__{(back to derek, diverting)}
<D>__{can i use your computer?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<A>__{danny walks off, crosses seth’s path, gets shoved into the wall, and reacts like it’s an everyday occurrence. derek kisses doris’ forehead, smiles and stares into her eyes. derek’s pov – tight on a smirking doris. match cut to: interior prison visiting room – doris – flashback she holds a receiver to her ear, a look of false strength in her eyes.}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{are you making it okay?}
<A>__{derek sits opposite from doris and nods, not wanting her to think otherwise.}
<C>__{doris}

<C>__{derek}
<D>__{mom? relax. it’s going to good use. what about dan?}
<C>__{doris}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{i don’t know. he says he’s good but... cammeron’s name keeps popping up.}
<A>__{tight on derek’s eyes. that’s the last thing he wanted to hear.}
<C>__{doris }
<D>__{i can’t monitor him all day, derek. i wish i could but i can’t. he needs you.}
