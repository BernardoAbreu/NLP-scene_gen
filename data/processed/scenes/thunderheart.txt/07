<L>__{interior gray building fencing operation}
<A>__{carl follows ray into the big sparse room of unfinished sheetrock walls. there is nothing in here but cardboard boxes, and two people; a bearded hispanic man standing behind a counter, writing on a clipboard. the other is a middle aged black man in a purple silk shirt sitting in a chair with a newspaper held open. he barely looks over the top of the wall street journal.}
<C>__{black man}
<D>__{hey, look who's here.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{louis, my man, what's happenin'?}
<A>__{ray walks up to the counter. carl lingers, fidgeting. ray sets his briefcase on the counter and click clicks it open. the hispanic fence man looks inside, and begins pulling out stacks of treasury checks.}
<C>__{fence man}
<D>__{clean ones?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{immaculate.}
<A>__{ray gestures to carl and he nervously sets his briefcase on the counter, fumbles with the first latch. the second. he flips it open. the fence man casts his eyes down at a neat cache of grade a treasury. a lot of it. then his eyes rise to carl.}
<C>__{fence man}
<D>__{what ya got there, seventy five thousand?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{a hundred and ten. count it.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{have the girl count it, we can't sit around here countin' bonds, we got things to do here.}
<A>__{the fence man pushes an intercom button and yells into a speaker.}
<C>__{fence man}
<D>__{salllly!}
<A>__{carl's eyes flit to ray. ray's eyes flit to carl. louis crushes his newspaper down and lifts a big colt python from his lap just as a section of sheetrock kicks open and three federal officers bust out, each clutching a handgun, shouting inaudibly.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{f.b.i.! get your face on the fuckin' floor! move!}
<A>__{carl startled, does an almost effeminate dip down to one knee, but that knee is swept out from under him, slapping him flat onto plywood where he is instantly frisked down by the fence man who is wielding a 9 mm handgun. but the white collar criminal is more stunned by the fact that ray is walking across the floor with his hands in his pockets over to the mr. coffee. he pours one, and adds some milk. turns and watches the bust while opening a packet of sweet n'low.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{slam dunk.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{beauty. beauty...}
<A>__{ray rests his weight against the coffee station, takes a careful sip. carl is yanked to his feet by the fence man and he stands there, looking at ray, baffled. completely shocked.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{jesus christ, larry, what the fu larry. that's not even your name, is it? what's your real name, you fucking scumbag?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{don't have one, carl. i have a number, man. just like the numbers on those treasury checks. you stole from your own country, carl. shame on you.}
<A>__{coffee in hand, ray walks briskly toward the door.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{sugar ray.}
<A>__{ray turns. louis takes a few steps toward him, putting his gun back in his waistband.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{they want ya home. upstairs wants to see ya.}
<A>__{ray stands frozen, holding the door knob, and digesting what are apparently influential words.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{make sure ya spell my name right.}
<A>__{ray just stares for a moment. then hurries out the door. carl, being arm gripped by two agents and photographed like a trout, gazes bewildered at the door.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{we just spent four months together... i thought he was my friend... what the fuck, man?}
<P>__{(even more incredulous)}
<D>__{he had dinner at my mother's.}
<A>__{camera flashes at him, an agent on either side, striking a natural pose.}
