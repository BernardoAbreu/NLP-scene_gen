<A>__{jack happily decorates his room with the christmasland souvenirs. he festoons the electric chair with boughs of holly and a sprig of mistletoe atop the confining head cap. he tosses wreaths around the necks of the gargoyles that leer down from corners of the ceiling. he ties a red bow on zero. later, in bed, snuggled down, wearing a nightcap, his pile of christmas books beside him, jack gazes critically around his room. it is over bright with electric lights they're strung everywhere they can be strung. tinsel sparkles glaringly. lips pursed, jack climbs out of bed to pull a string of lights out behind an obscuring cobweb, then isn't satisfied just to see them, but traces the intricate pattern of the cobweb with them. he steps back for perspective, comes forward to make an adjustment, steps back to look again... he frowns. he scratches his head.}
