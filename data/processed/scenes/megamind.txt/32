<D>__{prepare the subject.}

<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{plato, pour the toxic waste.}
<A>__{plato throws a switch causing the vat to tip hundreds of gallons of green and brown goo into the hole.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{drainage.}
<A>__{the slime is sucked out through the floor, leaving a goo soaked severs. master mind looks into the pit.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{well, severs?}
<C>__{severs}
<D>__{i feel fine. just a little sticky, but aside from that everything's completely }
<A>__{boom severs explodes. a hail of blood and tissue covers master mind and his men. for a good ten seconds nobody moves an inch. finally...}
