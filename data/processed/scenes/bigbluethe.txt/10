<A>__{jacques bursts out of the house, running. diving gear under his arm. a piece of buttered bread in his mouth. he catches up with his father and uncle louis. they're on a path winding down to the port. jacques slows down abruptly. tries to imitate their stride. the weather is balmy and the sea lies before them, peaceful and blue.}
