<L>__{interior day amy's office}
<A>__{on the shelves, photographs of michael and daisy stand next to the medical records and legal medicine textbooks. sitting behind amy's desk, ben is studying gary lewis' file. he flips back and forth through the different documents, photographs, and police reports. amy observes him, perplexed. we sense that she is concerned about ben's strange behavior and over sensitivity.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{look at this picture... come and see, amy.}
<A>__{he shows her a snapshot taken by the police. we see gary soaked in his own blood, the throat slit open. the picture is real, crude. he lies outstretched, facing a mirror shattered into several pointy pieces, like a spider web. in his hand, gary still holds the piece of glass that he used to cut himself.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{look...}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what!?}
<A>__{ben points to the reflection in the mirror }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{look at the piece of mirror in his hand. in the reflection of the mirror it's covered in blood, and look in reality, it's clean. not a drop of blood...}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{so what?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{don't you find it strange that this mirror doesn't reflect an exact image of reality?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i can't see the difference. it must be an effect of the angle from which the photograph was taken. what is it you are you trying to prove?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what if the mirrors were showing us something different?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what? for christ's sake, listen to yourself, ben! what are you talking about?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what if the mirrors were reflecting something that goes beyond reality?}
<C>__{amy}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{ok... this is way over my head. i don't have time for your barfly theories.}
<A>__{ben realizes that he will not succeed in convincing her. not today.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{thanks for your help...}
<A>__{he's on his way out, when she holds him back }
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{you should go home and get some rest. this guy probably just killed himself because he couldn't live with himself anymore. it happens to thousands of people, you know...}
