<A>__{the school band is on stage and playing a particularly horrendous rendition of the star spangled banner. we find malee in the flute section, playing her heart out. the conductor, mr. farmer (40) overly energetic and dorky, waves his baton, silencing the band.}
<C>__{mr farmer}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{did anyone practice over the summer?}
<A>__{the band sits silent.}
<C>__{mr. farmer}
<D>__{great. well, we still have a fall recital coming up. if anyone would like to perform a solo, sign up on the sheet outside my office. class dismissed.}
