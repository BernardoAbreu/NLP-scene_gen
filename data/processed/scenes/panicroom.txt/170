<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{seen from overhead, meg paces in the master bedroom, out of her mind with worry, no idea how to communicate to the people in the room the desperate situation. suddenly, a voice comes over the intercom speaker.}
<C>__{burnham }
<D>__{i understand. i will give her the shot.}
<L>__{interior panic room night}
<A>__{a hand comes down into frame and picks up the glucogen and the leather pouch. burnham stands, looking down at them. raoul grabs him, pulls him to the far end of the room.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{you're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time. you don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{are you gonna open the safe?}
<A>__{raoul looks at him.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{then shut up and get out of my way.}
<A>__{as burnham crosses the room, raoul makes eye contact with sarah, who is staring at him.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{don't look at me.}
<A>__{across the room, burnham drops to his knees next to sarah and unzips the pouch.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{okay, kid, all i know about this is what i've seen on tv, you gotta talk me through it.}
<A>__{sarah tries to form words, but she's too weak. burnham swallows.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{okay. no talking. no problem. tv don't lie, right?}
<A>__{he reaches into the pouch, take out a syringe, a sterile pad, and a length of rubber tubing. he takes sarah's arm, stretches it out, exposing the underside of her forearm.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{you seem like a good kid. your mom... only saw her for a second, but, woah. beautiful, huh?}
<A>__{no answer. burnham ties the rubber tubing around sarah's arm, pulls it tight.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{hey, nod or something, show me you're still alive, will ya?}
<A>__{sarah nods.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{attagirl. that too tight?}
<A>__{sarah shakes her head no. burnham takes the syringe, starts to fill it from the glucogen bottle.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{you guys are pretty rich, huh?}
<A>__{sarah shrugs. while burnham goes through the process of finding an exposed vein and giving the injection itself, he goes on, as much to comfort sarah as to comfort himself:}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{yeah, you don't think about that stuff. good for you.}
<A>__{he looks at her, sees her looking at him. thinking about him.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{i know, i know. i really screwed the pooch this time. i never did anything like this before. break into somebody's house? not even close. bad cards, kid. i swear to god, i been on the wrong end of maybe six straight years of bad cards. house. car. wife.}
<P>__{(snaps his fingers gone)}
<D>__{those are some seriously bad cards. and still, every time i pick up a fresh hand i swear to god, the rush comes so hot and prickly i feel it right down to my toes because this time, this one time, it might be there, this time it might be that hand, that perfect hand, that monster hand.}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{and you thought you were sick.}
<A>__{the shot successfully given, he pulls sarah's sleeve back down.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{feel better?}
<A>__{sarah nods, and she seems better already. burnham helps her to sit up, to lean against the wall.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{woulda been a hell of a dad.}
