<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{why not?}
<A>__{mr. white crosses to mr. blonde.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{because this guy's a fucking psycho. and if you think joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off i am at him, for puttin me in the same room as this bastard.}
<C>__{mr. blonde}
<P>__{(to eddie)}
<D>__{you see what i been puttin up with? as soon as i walk through the door i'm hit with this shit. i tell 'm what you told me about us stayin put and mr. white whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "you motherfucker, i'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."}

<C>__{mr. blonde}
<D>__{i told 'em not to touch the alarm. they touched it. i blew 'em full of holes. if they hadn't done what i told 'em not it, they'd still be alive.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{that's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?}
<C>__{mr. blonde}
<D>__{i don't like alarms.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{what does it matter who stays with the cop? we ain't lettin him go. not after he's seen everybody. you should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{we were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{there is no fuckin set up!}
<P>__{(eddie takes charge)}
<D>__{look, this is the news. blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. white and pink come with me, 'cuz if joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.}
<A>__{eddie, mr. white and mr. pink walk out of the warehouse talking amongst themselves.}
