<A>__{simon is on his feet, in full badass gamer mode. his body is positioned exactly like kable's right hand gripping the virtual blade for an underhand thrust; left hand clutching castle's throat... he forces his right hand}

<D>__{you... fucking... do it...}
<A>__{castle delivers a crunching headbutt to his nose, kable loses his footing, sweat pouring down his face, bloody, drained... castle pushes the knife back towards kable. he fights back every muscle in his arm fighting against another like yin & yang, veins rising in his neck... then kable senses an opportunity:}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{look at this knife... imagine me sticking it into your gut... think about it... make it real.}
<A>__{castle laughs... but his eyes flicker to the knife of course he can't help but picture it... ... and in that instant kable jams in the blade...}

<P>__{(blank)}
<D>__{oops.}
<A>__{... castle focuses, trying to pull it back out, but kable shoves it in deeper castle's eyes bulge. finally kable twists the knife and lifts castle off the ground. the paralysis breaks from angie she lunges forward to throw her arms around her daughter.}
