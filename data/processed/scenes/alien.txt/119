<D>__{ohmygooaaaa ahhhhh !!!}
<A>__{a red smear of blood blossoms on the chest of broussard's tunic. their eyes are all rivetted to broussard's chest as the fabric of his tunic is ripped open, and a horrible nasty little head the size of a man's fist pushes out. everybody screams and leaps back from the table. the cat spits and bolts. the disgusting little head lunges, comes spurting out of broussard's chest trailing a thick, wormlike tail splattering fluids and blood lands in the middle of the dishes and food on the table and scurries away while the men are stampeding for safe ground. when they finally regain control of themselves, it has escaped. broussard lies slumped in his chair, a huge hole in his chest, spouting blood. the dishes are scattered and the food is covered with blood and slime.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{oh, no. oh, no.}
<C>__{faust}
