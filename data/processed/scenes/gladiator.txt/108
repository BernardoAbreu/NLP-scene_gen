<A>__{the wolf of rome sleeps. then its ears rise. then its head. it sniffs the air. the wolf slowly rises and begins loping through the camp. it passes slumbering soldiers and tents, smoke lazily drifting up from campfires. the wolf finally stops and looks up. maximus is on a horse. he climbs down. the wolf goes to him and licks his hand. maximus begins marching through the camp, the wolf at his side. soldiers stir, amazed to see their general is alive. gallus leaps up, stunned, and goes to maximus. they continue to march through the camp, more and more astonished soldiers joining them. they march toward the large tents at the center of the encampment. titus emerges from his tent. slams to a stop }

<D>__{where is he?}
<A>__{just then quintus emerges from the largest tent. he stares at maximus, unbelieving. a long beat as they look at each other. quintus knows his destiny. with quiet dignity he begins whispering a prayer. maximus moves to him, embracing him:}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{i forgive you.}
<A>__{he stabs quintus with a dagger as he embraces him. quintus falls. a beat. titus goes to the dead quintus and pulls the seal of office from his uniform. he hands it to maximus. an enormous roar of celebration from the felix regiment.}
