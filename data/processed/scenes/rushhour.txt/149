<D>__{dazzle me.}
<L>__{interior north korean consulate surveillance room day}
<A>__{carson clicks off the phone, then, as he dials another number:}
<C>__{carson}
<P>__{(to walther)}
<D>__{we got one of the best sound guys right here in town...}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{newman in audio analysis...}
<C>__{dave }
<D>__{newman's gone.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{dave comes into the room.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{he quit, couple weeks ago. opened a bed and breakfast in wyoming.}
<A>__{carson looks at miranda and hangs up the phone.}
<C>__{dave}
<P>__{(continuing; looks around)}
<D>__{damn... they get hbo? i'd sure like to see the fight tonight.}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{get those tapes transferred to a sound guy. we need ambient and background analysis, the whole enchilada.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{enchilada you saying that because i'm mexican?}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{no... 'cause you're fat.}
<C>__{miranda}

<D>__{jesus h. christ...}
<C>__{sabatini}
<D>__{i'd send it to langley. let the cia earn their keep.}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{do it.}
<A>__{carson tosses javal's bloody, unlabeled prescription bottle to miranda. she looks it over, runs her finger inside, tastes the dust on her fingertip.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{given his behavior, this orange residue... i'd say desoxyn, 25 mg. amphetamines.}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{any significance?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{it's consistent with the lone wolf scenario: a handful of these is pure bravery in a bottle, 'til the psychosis and paranoia kick in.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we could check pharmacy records, on the remote chance he got them legally... if we had a couple of weeks, that is.}
<C>__{carson}
<P>__{(to sabatini)}
<D>__{get the bureau on it.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{forget it. it's a waste of manpower.}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{look, goddammit, you start skipping no chance in hell leads, we can all quit and go to the beach right now.}
<A>__{sabatini looks at them which will it be? miranda frowns and nods her okay, then spreads the l.a. map out on the table.}
<C>__{carson}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{he grabbed the family at 8:30. the last certain visual we had was just before his van went into the alley on la cienega at 8:42. he called the consulate at 9:30.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{that gives him about fifty minutes to get to his location, move and secure the hostages, and activate his time bomb.}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{he probably waited a while to pad the time he wanted us know the family was still alive...}
<P>__{(sotto; re koreans)}
<D>__{...so these crazy bastards wouldn't throw a premature shit hemorrhage, but he didn't want to call too soon, either. i say they're within 15 to 20 minutes, via surface streets, of where we last saw them.}
<A>__{he draws a circle on the city map: beverly hills to downtown, hollywood to inglewood.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{the most densely populated part of the l.a. basin. this narrows it down to about 200,000 dwellings.}
<A>__{a beat while this sinks in.}
<C>__{miranda}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{he was traveling west }
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{ bet he doubled back.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{c'mon, that's total conjecture }
<C>__{sabatini}
<P>__{(re carson)}
<D>__{ i'd trust his instincts when dealing with maniacs. he is deeply disturbed.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{you're telling me?}
