<D>__{what the hell are you doing with tape on your face?}
<A>__{no time to explain two more security guards arrive. kicks and punches fly, but lee can't get hit in the mouth! he bobs and weaves, holding his hands to carter to untie them in between swings. suddenly: blam! blam! blam! gunshots from the eye in the sky room. everyone hits the deck. carter and lee dive on to the floor as panic ripples through the casino. people flee for the}

<D>__{this can't be good.}
<A>__{lee's eyes bug he sees it too, feet stampeding past it! a high heel misses it by a fraction of an inch. he lunges for it, manages to cradle it in his taped hands when wham! he is bumped and it flies away. the second it hits the floor, it is kicked, skittering down the red carpet. above...the victor emerges in the eye in the sky room. hu li steps out on the pagoda roof and jumps down. the detonator rolls right past hu li. as she bends to pick up the detonator, lee knows he won't get there in time. horrified, he screams at carter through the tape. hu li lifts the detonator. carter finally pulls the tape off lee's face. lee spits the grenade into the air.}
