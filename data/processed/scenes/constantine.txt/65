<L>__{interior angela's apartment day}
<A>__{that surveillance video footage from ravenscar plays again. there's isabel in her nightgown walking across the roof. spread out on a cluttered coffee table is isabel's case file. coroner's report is opened. let's see "no drugs in system" and the biggie "cause of death suicide." angela sits on the couch in her robe. disheveled and distraught. she's taking this hard.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{i'm sorry, isabel...}
<A>__{she lowers her head. and in that brief moment of silence }
<C>__{isabel }
<P>__{(on tv)}
<D>__{constantine.}
<A>__{angela snaps back to the tv, freezes in shock. there's isabel ready to jump but this time she's looking right back at us at angela. then she's gone. angela quickly rewinds the tape and watches the sequence again. this time isabel doesn't look back. this time there is no name. but angela did see it. did hear it. she sits for a second. stunned.}
