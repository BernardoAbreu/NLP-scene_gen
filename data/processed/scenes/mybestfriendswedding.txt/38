<L>__{interior crab house night}
<A>__{close on a bowl filled with squares of butter. hear the butt of conversation from a rowdy, friendly jointerior julianne's right hand reaches to the bowl, fingers trace the rim innocently, then... ... slide the bowl into julianne's lap beneath the table. her right hand massages all the butter into a gooey revolving mess. we can pick out familiar voices now, family in distance, the twins closer. as, hidden from view, julianne brings... ... her left hand from her pocket. yep. the ring is still there. the finger already red and swollen from pacicky efforts to pull it off. and as applause surrounds us, julianne... plunges her ring finger into the morass of grease, frantically tearing at the ring, butter splurging on her pants, everywhere, as we pull back to see... ... the long table covered with butcher paper, the family at the far end, the twins down here with us, a mug of beer for each place, as team of waiters with heaping platters of crabs, which they... ... fling across the butcher paper, as applause continues from everyone but julianne, who still struggles secretly. as the waiters set huge wooden mallets in front of each guest, joe o'neal rises, pounds the table with his mallet for attention.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{like to welcome ever'body to our little rehearsal supper...}
<A>__{he coughs, unaccustomed to public speaking. walter and isabelle clap and call out support. so joe lifts his mallet...}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{okay, everyone stand up!}
<A>__{and everyone does. with one exception. trapped. she jams her left hand in her coat pocket, smears her right palm sort of clean on the underside of the table, grabs her mallet and jumps up.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{to the bride, uh, goes the honor... of cracking the first crab!}
<A>__{everyone applauses by banging their mallets. joe raises his high. everybody imitates.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{but first, a toast!}
<A>__{and everybody snatches up their beers with their left hands, as julianne drops her mallet with a horrific crash, grabbing her beer, looking up to...}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(on the spot)}
<D>__{i'm right handed.}
<A>__{a hugely embarrassing half second. bailed out by...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{to our host, my cuddly papa joe.}
<A>__{all turns.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{who taught me to play "blue hawaii." on my nose.}
<A>__{with a look at julianne, kim sets down her mallet gently, and performs a nasal hum of the tropical standard, strikingly her nostril repeatedly for vibrato. it is charming, and everybody watches.}
