<L>__{interior theater curran theater day}
<A>__{the curtain is up; the set, covered, is a bedroom in a deteriorating southern mansion. there is no one in the theater but max, seated on the aisle about two thirds down, and eve with lloyd and bill on the stage. she is seated; they stand between her and auditorium. there is some ad lib talk among the three which we cannot make out. margo marches down the aisle with a steady pace. she passes max smiles a sickly, hopeful smile. she ignores him as if he were a used paper cup. she disappears through the door which leads backstage. max whistles. lloyd turns. max indicated the door and puts his hands to his head in despair. margo walks out of the wings on stage. bill and lloyd turn to her. eve rises.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(cheerily)}
<D>__{terribly sorry i'm late, lunch was long and i couldn't find a cab where's miss caswell, shall we start? oh, hello, eve...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{hello, miss channing.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{how are you making out in mr. fabian's office?}
<P>__{(over the footlights to max)}
<D>__{i don't want you working the child too hard, max just because you promised. as you see, i kept my promise, too...}
<A>__{max slumps in his seat. by the time margo turns back to them, the others have exchanged swift looks.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{it's all over.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{what's all over?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{the audition.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(pleased astonishment)}
<D>__{eve?}
<P>__{(she turns to her)}
<D>__{how enchanting...}
<P>__{(to lloyd and bill)}
<D>__{wherever did you get the idea of having eve read with miss caswell?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{she's your understudy.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{eve? eve, my understudy? but i had no idea...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{i thought you knew... she was put on over a week ago }
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{it seems almost inconceivable that i haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. so eve is not working for max after all }
<P>__{(out to max again)}
<D>__{ max you sly puss.}
<A>__{max submerges further in his seat.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{miss channing, i can't tell you how glad i am that you arrived so late.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{really, eve? why?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{well, if you'd been here to begin with, i wouldn't have dared to read at all...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{... and if you'd come in the middle, i'd have stopped, i couldn't have gone on }
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(murmurs)}
<D>__{what a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what fire and music?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{you wouldn't understand.}
<P>__{(to lloyd)}
<D>__{how was miss caswell?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{back to copacabana. but eve. margo, let me tell you about eve }
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(breaking in)}
<D>__{i was dreadful, miss channing, believe me i have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i'm sure you underestimate yourself, eve. you always do.}
<P>__{(to lloyd)}
<D>__{you were about to tell me about eve...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{you'd have been proud of her.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i'm sure.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{she was a revelation...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{to you, too?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(the ice begins to form)}
<D>__{i mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty four year old character played by twenty four year old actress...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{that's beside the pointerior}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{it's right to the pointerior also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{addison !}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{so full of meaning, fire and music!}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{you've been talking to that venomous fishwife, addison dewitt }
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{ in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the world almanac!}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{you knew when you came in that the audition was over, that eve was your understudy! playing that childish game of cat and mouse...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{not mouse, never mouse! if anything rat!}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{you have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{perfectly innocent! man have been hanged for less! i'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately as if it were holy gospel!}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{i never said it was!}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{then you listened as if someone else had written you play whom did you have in mind? sherwood? arthur miller? beaumont and fletcher?}
<A>__{max has edged his way to the stage.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(from below)}
<D>__{may i say a word?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{no!}
<P>__{(to margo)}
<D>__{what makes you think that either miller or sherwood would stand for the nonsense i take from you you'd better stick to beaumont and fletcher! they've been dead for three hundred years!}
<A>__{he stalks into the wings. bill's reaction to the fight is typical. he lights a cigarette, stretches out on the covered bed. eve stands frozen with fear. margo yells after lloyd into the wings.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{and they're getting better performances today than they ever got! all playwrights should be dead for three hundred years!}
<A>__{lloyd comes out of the door leading to the auditorium. the battle goes on without a pause. as he yells back, he crosses to max at row a, center.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{that would solve none of their problems because actresses never die! the stars never die and never change!}
<A>__{he starts up the aisle with max.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{you can change this star any time you want! for a new, fresh, exciting one fully equipped with fire and music! any time you want starting with tonight's performance!}
<A>__{now it's max who stops and shouts back at her.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{this is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run of the play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(from the stage)}
<D>__{are you threatening me with legal action, mr. fabian?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{are you breaking the contract?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{answer my question!}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{who am i to threaten? i'm a dying man.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i didn't hear you.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{i said i'm a dying man!}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(from the top of the aisle)}
<D>__{i shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind! just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{it's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto!}
<A>__{max has already walked out unhappily. lloyd now slams out. margo glares after him, then turns to bill who smokes his cigarette peacefully on the bed.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(quiet menace)}
<D>__{and you, i take it, are the paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?}
<P>__{(bill waves his cigarette; he's noncommittal)}
<D>__{where is princess fire and music?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{the kid. junior.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(looks lazily)}
<D>__{gone.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i must have frightened her away.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i wouldn't be surprised. sometimes you frighten me.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(paces up and down)}
<D>__{poor little flower. just dropped her petals and folded her tent...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{don't mix your metaphors.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i mix what i like.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{okay. mix.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i'm nothing but a body with a voice. no mind.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what a body, what a voice.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{the ex ship news' reporter. no body, no voice, all mind!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{the gong rang. the fight's over. calm down.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i will not calm down!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{don't calm down.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{you're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i'm trying terribly hard.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{well, you needn't. i will not be tolerated. and i will not be plotted against!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{here we go...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{such nonsense, what do you all take me for little nell from the country? been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt }
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(sits up)}
<D>__{now don't get carried away }
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(going right on)}
<D>__{ shows up for an audition when everyone knew i'd be here... and gives a performance! out of nowhere gives a performance!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you've been all through that with lloyd }
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{the playwright doesn't make the performance and it doesn't just happen! and this one didn't full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed i have no doubt, over and over, full of those bill sampson touches!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{paranoiac!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i didn't know eve harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{tell that to dr. freud! along with the rest of it...}
<A>__{she turns away. bill grabs her, pulls her down on the bed. he holds her down.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{no, i will tell it to you! for the last time, i will tell it to you. because you've got to stop hurting yourself, and me, and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums!}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(struggling)}
<D>__{that word again! i don't even know what it means...}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{it's time you found out. i love you.}
<P>__{(margo says "ha!")}
<D>__{i love you. you're a beautiful and intelligent woman }
<P>__{(margo says "a body with a voice")}
<D>__{ a beautiful and intelligent woman and a great actress }
<P>__{(he waits; margo says nothing)}
<D>__{ at the peak of her career. you have every reason for happiness }
<P>__{(margo says "except happiness")}
<D>__{ every reason, but due to some strange, uncontrollable, unconscious drive you permit the slightest action of a kid }
<P>__{(margo sneers "kid!")}
<D>__{ kid like eve to turn you into a hysterical, screaming harpy! now once and for all, stop it!}
<A>__{margo seems quiet. he gets up. she sits up.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{it's obvious you're not a woman.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i've been aware of that for some time.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{well, i am.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i will say.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{don't be condescending.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{come on, get up. i will buy you a drink.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(with dignity)}
<D>__{i admit i may have seen better days, but i am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail like a salted peanut.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{margo, let's make peace.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{the terms are too high. unconditional surrender.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{just being happy? just stopping all this nonsense about eve and eve and me?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{it's not nonsense.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{but if i tell you it is as i just did. were you listening to me?}
<P>__{(margo nods)}
<D>__{isn't that enough?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i wish it were.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{then what would be enough?}
<P>__{(margo doesn't answer)}
<D>__{if we were married?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... margo, tell me what's behind all this.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i i don't know, bill. just a feeling, i don't know...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.}
<P>__{(margo doesn't say)}
<D>__{i said before it was going to be my last try, and i meant it. i can't think of anything else to do. i wish i could.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{we usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. then it comes up again and everything's fine. but not this time.}
<P>__{(he takes a breath)}
<D>__{you know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. goodbye, margo.}
<A>__{no word from her. he starts away.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{bill...}
<P>__{(he stops)}
<D>__{... where are you going? to find eve?}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(smiles grimly)}
<D>__{that suddenly makes the whole thing believable.}
<A>__{he goes out. margo, alone, sit for a moment sadly. then she begins to cry...}
