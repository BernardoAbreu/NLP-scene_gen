<A>__{the forest is pitch black. young edward ducks between trees, under branches, not stopping for anything, gasping for breath. he doesn't turn to look behind him. he just runs as fast as he can. p.o.v. creature: tomething chases young edward through the dark forest. its p.o.v. is skewed, inhuman. it is gaining on him. as young edward runs, beams of light become visible through the closely packed trees. something is up ahead, something bright. edward runs towards it. young edward bursts out into a clearing in the woods, running towards the bright light. p.o.v. creature: the light stops whatever is chasing young edward at the edge of the forest. what is making the light isn't visible, only young edward's silhouette running towards the blinding light.}
