<L>__{interior jackie's kitchen night}
<A>__{jackie carrying two steaming mugs from her stove. these have marshmallows floating in them. she sets them down in front of her children. ben starts plucking the marshmallows out of annabelle's mug. annabelle doesn't care, too busy video taping... ...her father. who sits with this tender, compassionate, and therefore rather ominous smile. doesn't take a smart kid like his daughter to guess...}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{so what's up? who's marrying who this time?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{mommy's marrying rache!}
<A>__{he's happy. jackie reaches and shuts off annabelle's camera. and the directness in her gaze keeps the child from complaining.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{mommy's sick, guys.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you have the worst flu since...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i have cancer. do you know what that is?}
<A>__{he doesn't. someone else does.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<P>__{( real quiet)}
<D>__{it's what grammy lil died from.}
<A>__{ben's eyes whip over to his sister. he sees the cold fear in her face. back to mom. she seems fine, calm, smiling even.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{grammy had a different kind. there are lots of kinds. hers was very bad.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{is your bad?}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{shut up. she's going to die.}
<A>__{but the anger in her eyes isn't for ben. she is glaring. at her mom.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{actually, i'm getting better already.}
<A>__{straight. as if to an equal, an adult.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{a lot smaller.}
<A>__{annabelle cuts him an angry look. he's on her shit list, too.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{so you're okay.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i'm still sick, but i'm better.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{you lied to us when you never told us!}
<A>__{ben hadn't thought of that. nods now, yeh.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{that's right. and you're mad.}
<A>__{annabelle just glares with all the hatred she can turn her fear into.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i know how scared i get when you're sick. so i waited to tell you. until it was getting smaller. i thought that was best, maybe i was wr...}

<D>__{i'd rather be with mommy.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{she's dying and rache is your mother now!}
<A>__{she jumps up from the table. hisses at her brother...}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{you are so stupid!}
<A>__{and she runs, halfway to the door...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{annabelle!}
<A>__{she turns, startled at the anger in that.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you do not run out on your moth...}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{you're worse than she is! why don't you just die, too ?}
