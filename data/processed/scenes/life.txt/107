<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior camp 8 yard day}
<A>__{it's visiting sunday and ray's boom boom room is in full swing. sylvia's girls are everywhere. down at the gunline, dillard takes his cut from inmates lined up for their turn in the tonk. a five piece prison band is playing the blues. nearby, willie is dispensing ray's moonshine from a bunkhouse window. he raises a jar in a toast.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{to superintendent abernathy. may he have many more grandchildren!}
<A>__{the incorrigibles erupt in boisterous agreement. claude grabs can't get right and shakes him.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{what i want to know is where? when? how?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{wasting your breath, claude. he ain't the type to kiss and tell.}
<A>__{just then, rev. clay and his daughter emerge from the mess hall and start across the yard. it's a good thing the old man is blind because he wouldn't want to see how far his flock has strayed. the reverend inhales deeply as one of sylvia's girls passes nearby.}
<C>__{rev. clay}
<D>__{there's a sweet fragrance in the air today.}
<C>__{clay's daughter}
<D>__{the magnolias are blooming early this year, daddy.}
<A>__{blissed out incorrigibles enjoy a last dance as the band downshifts into a slow, sultry number. in the midst of the dancers, claude clings to sylvia. nearby, jangle leg dances intimately with a young woman. up on the porch, ray refreshes biscuit's drink. biscuit has been crying and it shows. the liquor probably isn't helping.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{don't take it so hard, biscuit. she don't mean nothin' to him.}
<C>__{biscuit}
<D>__{hell with him. it ain't that.}
<A>__{he pulls some folded sheets of paper from his pocket, passes them to ray.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{these are free papers.}
<C>__{biscuit}
<P>__{(devastated)}
<D>__{what am i gonna do out there, ray? i can't go home to my mama like this. i will get the strap for sure.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{come on, biscuit, this is good news. your mama's gonna break down in tears when you show up on her doorstep.}
<A>__{poker face leans in.}
<C>__{poker face}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{i will give you three to one she gives him the strap.}
<A>__{ray gives poker face a shove, then turns back to biscuit.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{it's 1945. it's a different world now.}
<C>__{biscuit}
<D>__{not for me, it ain't.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{well you can't stay here, biscuit. this ain't no life for a man. any one of these fellas would give their right arm to be in your shoes. i sure know i would.}
<A>__{ray hands back the papers and heads off to dance with a pretty young woman lingering nearby. left alone, biscuit polishes off his moonshine and checks his reflection in the bunkhouse window.}
<C>__{biscuit}
<D>__{no life on the inside, no life on the outside...}
<A>__{he crumples the discharge papers and drops them. then he steps down from the porch and walks calmly past the dancing prisoners toward the gun line. ray lifts his head off his date's shoulder. something about the way biscuit is walking suggests that he isn't going to stop.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{hey, biscuit...!}
<A>__{but it's too late. biscuit crosses the gun line and keeps walking, his eyes focused on the horizon.}
<C>__{trusty}
<D>__{man over the line!}
<A>__{the band stops playing, the dancers grow still. dillard turns around and squints.}
<C>__{dillard}
<D>__{goddamnit, biscuit, get back here!}
<A>__{but biscuit isn't paying attention. he breaks into a run. dillard nods to hoppin' bob who raises his rifle and draws a bead. but he can't pull the trigger. he lowers his gun. shots ring out from the shooter shacks. biscuit reels from the impact of the bullets and looks down sadly at the blood spreading across his ring arounds... prisoners silently gather at the gunline. jangle leg pushes his way through the crowd and crosses the gunline without hesitation. dillard indicates for the shooters to hold their fire. they train their rifles on jangle leg as he strides toward his fallen companion. jangle leg gently lifts biscuit's lifeless body into his big arms and somberly carries him back toward the camp. the camera rises high overhead as the prisoners make way for jangle leg to cross back over the gunline.}
