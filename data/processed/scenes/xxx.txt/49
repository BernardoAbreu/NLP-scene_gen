<L>__{exterior half pipe disco night}
<A>__{a fancy, flashy disco with an extreme sports theme. a big bouncer in a leather coat works the door. this is a highclass, expensive joint but it still looks seedy and dangerous. xander and slovo walk up to the place. xander's wearing a tshirt that says "ron jeremy: american legend" complete with a photo of the hedgehog.}
<L>__{interior half pipe disco night}
<A>__{a stripper that looks like a runway model slides across the stage on skateboard knee pads while patrons cheer. the disco is a combination strip club and concert venue. all the strippers are outfitted in helmets, elbow pads, g strings and belly shirts. there's a warped tour band playing on a stage. on either side of the stage are two mini half pipes that the girls are cutting back and forth on. wealthy businessmen sit in plush booths getting table dances while the dance floor is packed with sexily dressed young}
