<L>__{interior imax room day}
<A>__{an old 19th century theater. balconies. heavy curtains. it looks like the theater where lincoln was shot, with the exception of the most recent addition, an imax screen five stories high. the room is filling with museum employees, all murmuring anxiously. margo sits down next to frock's wheelchair. her face is ashen.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{dr. frock, i just saw a man back there who'd been wading in blood.}
<A>__{as greg kawakita sits in the chair next to margo...}
<C>__{margo }
<D>__{for once i'm glad you're rumor central. what in the world is going on?}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{someone's been murdered. not shot, strangled or stabbed, either. torn limb from limb. there's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{for heaven's sake, greg, someone's been killed. look, it's cuthbert. let's hear what really happened.}
<A>__{at this everyone falls silent and ian cuthbert steps forward to address the crowd. he appears drawn and grey.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{this has been a tragic and upsetting morning. i have terrible news for us all. a member of our security force has been found murdered. the police have just informed me it was daniel beauregard.}
<P>__{(murmuring fills the room)}
<D>__{quiet. please. with the help of our head of security, mr. ippolito... the museum has been secured.}
<A>__{ippolito... rises in the back and nods to the crowd... he's an imperious looking, pompous man with shifty eyes. right now he's defensive. overnight, his job is on the line...}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{the police are satisfied we're in no danger, that we're all perfectly safe. we've been asked to remain in the gem room and be available for questioning for the rest of the day. obviously, we will all do everything we can to cooperate. are there any questions?}
<A>__{ippolito raises a hand.}
<C>__{ippolito}
<D>__{the party for the opening of the superstition exhibit... i imagine in the light of what's happened it will be pushed back.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{no action has been taken yet. the opening of the exhibit is crucial to the financial health of this museum. so for now, we expect that the superstition exhibit will open on schedule, tomorrow night.}
<A>__{ippolito registers surprise. the audience buzzes again.}
