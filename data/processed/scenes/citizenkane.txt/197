<T>__{dissolve:}
<L>__{interior chicago opera house night }
<A>__{it is the same opening night it is the same moment as before except taht the camera is now upstage angling toward the audience. the curtain is down. we see the same tableau as before the terrified and trembling susan, the apprehensive principals, the maids and singing teachers, the stage hands. as the dissolve commences, there is the sound of applause (exactly as before) and now as the dissolve completes itself, the orchestra breaks frighteningly into opening chords of the music the stage is cleared susan is left alone, terribly alone. the curtain rises. the glare of the footlights jump into the image. the curtain is now out of the picture and susan starts to sing. beyond her, we see the prompter's box, containing the anxious face of the prompter. beyond that, out in the darkness an apprehensive conductor struggles with his task of coordinating an orchestra and an incompetent singer. beyond that dimly white shirt fronts and glistening bosoms for a couple of rows, and then deep and terrible darkness. closeup of kane's face seated in the audience listening. sudden but perfectly correct lull in the music reveals a voice from the audience a few words from a sentence the kind of thing that often happens in a theatre }
<C>__{the voice}
<D>__{ really pathetic.}
<A>__{music crashes in and drowns out the rest of the sentence, but hundreds of people around the voice have heard it (as well as kane) and there are titters which grow in volume. closeup of susan's face singing. closeup of kane's face listening. there is the ghastly sound of three thousand people applauding as little as possible. kane still looks. then, near the camera, there is the sound of about a dozen people applauding very, very loudly. camera moves back, revealing bernstein and reilly and other kane stooges, seated around him, beating their palms together. the curtain is falling as we can see by the light which shutters down off their faces. the stage from kane's angle. the curtain is down the lights glowing on it. still, the polite applause dying fast. nobody comes out for a bow. closeup of kane breathing heavily. suddenly he starts to applaud furiously. the stage from the audience again. susan appears for her bow. she can hardly walk. there is a little polite crescendo of applause, but it is sickly. closeup of kane still applauding very, very hard, his eyes on susan. the stage again. susan, finishing her bow, goes out through the curtains. the light on the curtain goes out and the houselights go on. closeup of kane still applauding very, very hard.}
