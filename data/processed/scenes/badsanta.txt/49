<A>__{on the outskirts of the saguaro square mall's parking lot a city bus stops with a hiss. the doors swing open to reveal a pathetic eight year old kid, overweight, snot nosed, badly dressed and probably smelling of pee. as the kid nears the mall entrance he passes a group of older children doing skateboard stunts. they notice him.}

<A>__{one of them throws an empty can that hits him in the head. the kid walks on, it seems without noticing. the bullies, disheartened by the lack of reaction, go back to their skateboarding.}
