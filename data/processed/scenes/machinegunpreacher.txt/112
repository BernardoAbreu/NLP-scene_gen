<L>__{exterior children's orphanage night}
<A>__{and we see a handful of spla soldiers stationed around the perimeter of the compound, standing guard. sam and deng sitting next to a lantern by the front gate.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you know what's funny? in english your name means "darn it."}
<C>__{deng}
<D>__{what is this `darn it?'}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{deng. it means `shucks.' you know, like you stub your toe and you go "ahhhhh, deng!" get it?}
<C>__{deng}
<P>__{(dead serious)}
<D>__{this is not funny. in my language, in arabic, names are very important. they tell you everything about a man.}
<P>__{(becoming heated)}
<D>__{your name proceeds you wherever you go. you are sam. this is how you are known. in my language this means something.}
<A>__{sam feeling terrible, realizes he's offended him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm sorry, buddy. it was just a joke.}
<A>__{quiet, awkward, just the two of them sitting here quietly for a long beat. finally...}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{what does sam mean in arabic?}
<C>__{deng}
<D>__{small penis.}
<A>__{and deng smiles brightly. sam realizing he's been played. and deng starts to laugh. a deep, guttural, infectious laugh. sam joining him, and we sense that at this moment these two have become friends. and gradually their laughter subsides, and it's quiet again.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{can i ask you a question?}
<C>__{deng}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you believe in god?}
<A>__{deng considering this for a beat, and then...}
<C>__{deng}
<D>__{i was raised to believe there was a god in heaven.}
<C>__{deng }
<D>__{but it is impossible to live here, to see what i have seen, and not turn your back on him.}
<B>__{beat.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{maybe you'll invite him in again one day.}
<C>__{deng}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
