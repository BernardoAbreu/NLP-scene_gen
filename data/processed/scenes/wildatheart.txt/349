<A>__{lula wriggles out of the car and flys into his arms. behind them is a giant golden sunset. as they embrace the sound of the horns goes away. lulas gaze goes to a reflection of golden light on a windshield. it is the same abstract scene she saw before in her room in big tuna, but now she knows what it is. it is paces happy, smiling eyes looking up at the two of them in love. sailor, with a giant blue nose, looks into lulas eyes and sings love me tender. the people in their cars, and the people on the street look on with a feeling of love and happiness in their hearts.}
