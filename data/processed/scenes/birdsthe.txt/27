<A>__{reaching down to pick up a dead bird. med. shot al malone, the deputy a plain man with a limited intelligence, used to giving out speeding tickets or warning drunks. he holds the bird on the palm of his hand, looks at it steadily, nodding all the while.}
<C>__{malone}
<D>__{that's a chimney swift, all right.}
<A>__{close shot mitch}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{we know what it is, al.}
<A>__{full shot the room lydia is huddled in one of the easy chairs, still in shock.}
<C>__{malone}
<D>__{well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{not by the thousands.}
<C>__{malone}
<D>__{no, i gotta admit this is peculiar.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{did you have a light burning or something.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{yes, but the curtains were drawn.}
<C>__{malone}
<D>__{'cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{sure is a peculiar thing.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{what are we going to do about it, al?}
<C>__{malone}
<D>__{i don't think i get you, mitch. do about what?}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{well...}
<P>__{(he feels a little foolish)}
<D>__{well... these birds attacked us.}
<A>__{close shot malone slight disbelief on his face.}
<C>__{malone}
<D>__{what's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all.}
<A>__{close shot mitch}
<C>__{mitch}
<P>__{(still a little hesitant)}
<D>__{all right, i will grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. but, they didn't just get in. they came in! right down that chimney.}
<A>__{two shot mitch and malone}
<C>__{malone}
<P>__{(trying to make sense of this)}
<D>__{my wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.}
<C>__{malone}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{didn't know how he got in there. had a broken leg, turned out. just fluttering all around there.}
<P>__{(he shrugs again)}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{these birds were...}
<C>__{malone}
<D>__{what i'm trying to say, mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? ain't much we can do about it.}
<P>__{(he shrugs)}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{tell him about the party.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{that's right. we had a party here this afternoon for cathy. her birthday.}
<C>__{malone}

<P>__{(he grins)}
<D>__{how old is she now?}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{eleven. in the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. and miss daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...}
<A>__{close shot malone considering this.}
<C>__{malone}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{were the kids bothering them or something? 'cause sometimes they'll do that, you know. if you make any kind of disturbance near them, they'll just come after you. i seen that plenty of times myself.}
<A>__{two shot malone and lydia}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{the children were playing a game, al. those gulls attacked without...}
<C>__{malone}
<D>__{now, lydia, 'attack' is a pretty strong word, don't you think? i mean, birds just don't go around attacking people without no reason, you know what i mean? the kids just probably scared them, that's all.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{these birds attacked!}
<C>__{malone}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{well, what would you like me to do, lydia? put out a pick up and hold on any suspicious birds in the area?}
<P>__{(he smiles)}
<D>__{now, that'd be pretty silly, wouldn't it?}
<A>__{close shot mitch}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{does this room look silly?}
<A>__{two shot mitch and malone}
<C>__{malone}
<D>__{no, you got quite a mess here, i will admit that.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{seems a little pointless, though. freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you want some help cleaning up?}
<A>__{close shot mitch exasperated.}
<C>__{mitch}

<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i will get my things from the car. do you want to walk with me, cathy?}
<A>__{two shot mitch and malone as cathy and melanie go out.}
<C>__{malone}
<D>__{well, if there's anything else i can do, mitch...}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{thanks, al. we'll be all right.}
<C>__{malone}
<D>__{goodnight, lydia.}
<A>__{no answer.}
<C>__{malone}
<D>__{sure is peculiar, i got to say that for it.}
<A>__{he exits. full shot the room it is silent. mitch looks across at lydia who sits as still as a stone in her chair. the door closes gently on a note of utter helplessness.}
