<L>__{intercutting }
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{uh, well, no suit jets and i'm still carrying a good deal of velocity.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{as soon as we get hooked up, i will come get you.}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{uh, i'd have to say negative on that, jim.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{negative on the transmission?}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{no, i heard you. negative on the maneuver. i am not retrievable.}
<A>__{mcconnell and terri share a quick, anguished look.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{woody, that's not possible. you're not going that fast.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{it comes down to the amount of fuel, honey. the suit jets were designed for attitude control, not travel. retrieval just won't work.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{it has to work!}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{hey, believe me, i don't like it any more than you do.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{woody }
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{run the numbers, jim.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{i am.}
<A>__{mcconnell finishes looking over the numbers on his display pad. terri is staring at him. when mcconnell's eyes meet hers, they are red rimmed. haunted.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{woody, you hang tight. we'll get into the remo, fire her up, drop her into a lower orbit and come scoop you up.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{sounds good, jim.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{it's gonna take half an hour to get the remo reoriented! woody'll be... he'll be in the atmosphere by then!}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{then we'll have to get her moving faster.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{we don't have time!}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{you listen to jim, honey. it's a good plan.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{no! we are going to }
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{oh jesus, look! the ship!}
<A>__{phil points. mcconnell and terri look.}
<B>__{the mars recovery cockpit}
<A>__{is now several kilometers below and behind them. it's glowing red... then orange... then white. then it erupts into a giant fireball, devoured by friction with mars' atmosphere. mcconnell, terri and phil in deep space are all staring at this, awed, when mcconnell happens to look up again. he sees something alarming.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{look out!}
<B>__{their pov}
<A>__{they are drifting quickly into the remo.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{brakes!}
<B>__{all three}
<A>__{fire their suit jets, slowing themselves down. they bang into the remo at about one tenth the speed woody did. they find handholds and grab on. mcconnell hits a button on the tether gun.}
<B>__{the hook}
<A>__{releases from the remo's hull. mcconnell hits another button and it is reeled all the way into the gun. phil is already scrabbling at a latch on the remo's outer airlock door.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{okay, let's get inside! phil, start dumping the cargo, or there won't be room for us.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{but we need those supplies for }
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{dump the cargo. hang on, woody!}
<B>__{woody}
<A>__{is looking back at the remo. smiles with relief to see that terri has reached it safely.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{will do, jim.}
<A>__{he turns to look at...}
<B>__{mars}
<A>__{right below him, filling his field of view. a long beat.}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{hey, beautiful...}
<B>__{back at the remo}
<A>__{terri makes a snap decision. she grabs the tether gun from mcconnell's surprised hands, then pushes off from the remo. mcconnell lunges after her, his gloved hand straining.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{terri, no!}
<A>__{but it's too late. she's already out of reach, and now fires her suit jets, pulling quickly away from the remo.}
<B>__{mcconnell}
<A>__{is reaching to activate his own jets, when phil's hand grabs at his wrist, restraining this suicidal courage. they stare at each other. mcconnell wrenches his hand free, half maddened, agonized, staring after terri.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{goddammit, terri, it won't work!}
<A>__{but terri keeps on going.}
<B>__{woody}
<A>__{looks back at the remo, as he continues to fall towards mars. sees the small figure of his wife heading towards him.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{terri, what are you doing?}
