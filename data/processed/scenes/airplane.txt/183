<D>__{just remember, the controls will feel very heavy compared to a fighter.}
<A>__{striker is fighting the wheel and the autopilot which is drifting in his way. finally, he throws the autopilot to the rear of the cockpit.}
<C>__{kramer }
<D>__{don't worry about that. it's perfectly normal. you must watch your airspeed closely. don't let it fall below 520. both your rudder pedals and elevator trim will have additional play due to increased drag, but you can compensate by lowering manifold pressure below 154. now there's one other thing. have you someone up there who can work the radio and leave you free for flying?}

<D>__{yes! the stewardess is here with me!}
<A>__{elaine rises. the autopilot is on her back, its hands clinging to her breasts. she removes it and seats it at engineer's console.}
<C>__{kramer }
<D>__{have her take the co pilot's seat.}
<A>__{elaine takes her seat as striker regains control of the plane. he hands elaine the mike.}

<D>__{the radio's all yours now. and keep an eye on that number three engine. it's running a little hot.}

<D>__{how's it handling?}
