<T>__{fade in :}
<A>__{sounds of feet shuffling across the carpet. a glass rattles on a tray. a television is on low in the background. slowly the camera lens opens from jacob's p.o.v. and we see jezzie puttering around the bedroom. suddenly she is aware that jacob is watching her. she smiles.}

<D>__{what a night, jake. it was crazy. you kept sayin' "sarah, close the window," over and over. and talkin' to your kids. even the dead one. weird. you know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. amazing, huh?}

<D>__{the doctor said you had a virus. that's what they say when they don't know what it is. you can't do anything for a week. he says you gotta recuperate.}
<P>__{(she strokes his forehead, and gets up)}
<D>__{now you just lie here. mrs. sandelman made you some chicken soup. it'll warm you up.}
<A>__{jezzie leaves the room. jacob watches her as she goes. he seems lost and confused.}
