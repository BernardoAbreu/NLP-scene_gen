<L>__{exterior city}
<A>__{gray and cold. the streets swept with rain. and once again the tentative piano: "jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. oh what fun it is to ride ... oh what fun it is to ride ... oh what fun..."}
<L>__{interior veterinary clinic}
<A>__{jack and eddie are sitting in the waiting room: small and dirty and packed with pet owners and their animals. after a moment, a woman with a clipboard appears.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{barker.}
<P>__{(no takers)}
<D>__{jock barker?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(realizing it's him)}

<C>__{woman}
<D>__{right. bring him back.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{come on, ed.}
<A>__{jack and eddie follow the woman down a corridor.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you should've brought a leash, mr. barker. the doctor doesn't like to be bitten.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he doesn't bite.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{they never do, mr. barker.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{baker.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{right. in there.}
<A>__{the woman points jack and eddie into a small room. there is an examining table, a sink, and on the wall, a chart detailing the various breeds of dogs and cats. jack glances around the room, then comes back to eddie, who's staring up at him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you shoulda brushed, pal.}
<A>__{just then, a man in a white coat breezes in.}
<C>__{dr. beasley }
<D>__{ah, labradorus retreiverus. good fellows. quiet, but able to appreciate a good joke.}
<A>__{dr. beasley pats eddie on the side, then turns to jack.}
<C>__{dr. beasley}
<D>__{beasley.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{baker.}
<C>__{dr. beasley}
<D>__{what's our friend's problem?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{teeth.}
<C>__{dr. beasley}
<D>__{what's wrong with them?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{they're falling out.}
<C>__{dr. beasley}
<D>__{uh oh. that's not good. let's get him up here.}
<A>__{jack lifts eddie up onto the table and dr. beasley opens eddie's mouth for a look. it doesn't take long.}
<C>__{dr. beasley}
<D>__{they gotta go.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(a take)}
<D>__{how many?}
<C>__{dr. beasley}
<D>__{five's my guess. maybe more. won't know till i get in there.}
<P>__{(consulting his clipboard)}
<D>__{leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{isn't there something you can give him? a pill or something?}
<C>__{dr. beasley}
<D>__{decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, mr. baker. it spreads into his chest. then the heart goes. we wouldn't want that, would we?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how will he eat?}
<C>__{dr. beasley}
<D>__{start him out on cottage cheese. if you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes. go down like pudding through a hot pipe.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no bones?}
<C>__{dr. beasley}
<D>__{no bones.}
<A>__{jack looks at eddie.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what do you do to him?}
<C>__{dr. beasley}
<D>__{don't worry, mr. baker. we'll knock him out. he won't feel a thing.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i think maybe i will bring him back next week ...}
<C>__{dr. beasley}
<D>__{the sooner we do this the better, mr. baker.}
