<L>__{interior seance room day}
<A>__{mrs. santiago enters a dark room with a window and door leading to a side street. a paisley bedspread is tacked over the window. in the center of the room is a round seance table. two heavyset sisters, clara (39), and louise (36), are standing beside an open closet. it is empty.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{please be seated.}
<A>__{mrs. santiago sits at the table. she seems apprehensive. clara steps into the closet and taps on each of the walls as though demonstrating that they are solid.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{my sister will be with us soon.}
<A>__{she steps back out and closes the door. louise inserts a tape into a boom box and then steps forward.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{sister oda mae. grant us the gift of your all seeing presence. appear for us now.}
<B>__{angle favoring closet}
<A>__{she turns back to the closet and opens the door. like magic, oda mae brown, 41, appears standing inside. she is a black woman in a white tunic. the whiteness of her garment makes it look as if she is glowing in the dark. mrs. santiago is wide eyed. sam smiles as oda mae steps into the room.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{mrs. santiago.}
<C>__{mrs. santiago}
<D>__{buenos dias.}
<A>__{she takes a twenty dollar bill from her purse and hands it to oda mae. clara graciously intercepts the money.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{i understand you are hoping to contact your husband.}
<C>__{mrs. santiago}
<D>__{si. si.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{well, i believe he's gonna be with us today.}
<C>__{mrs. santiago}
<D>__{oh, tsank you, tsank you.}
<A>__{tears well up in her eyes. she crosses herself several times.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{but there's no telling about the other world. you gotta cast out all doubt. you gotta believe. do you believe?}
<C>__{mrs. santiago}
<P>__{(nodding her head vigorously)}
<D>__{si. si. i believe. i believe.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{and remember, we don't make no promises. i can phone up there till i'm blue in the face,}
<P>__{(she points to the ceiling)}
<D>__{...but it don't necessarily mean he's gonna be home. them folks go shopping, they play bingo. it's just like here. you can't always get 'em.}
<A>__{mrs. santiago, utterly fascinated, nods understandingly.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{sure lady!}
<A>__{oda mae's eyes glance up curiously for a second, as though she heard something, and then she continues.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{okay, let's get ready then.}
<A>__{sam steps back as the sisters get up and position themselves behind oda mae. the moment feels rehearsed, theatrical. oda mae raises her hands into the air and closes her eyes. there is a hush in the room. her body begins to tremble. mrs. santiago clutches her chair. suddenly oda mae breaks out of her trance.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{we got a problem here. i don't think he's in. wait. i feel something. did he know someone who's passed over, someone named anna... mary... consuela... maria?}
<C>__{mrs. santiago}
<D>__{si, si! his mama. she's maria.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{ah! i knew it. he's with his mama.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{oh my god...}
<A>__{oda mae's eyes dart uncomfortably around the room.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{i'm afraid this is gonna be too hard. now i got two souls i gotta contact. i don't know about that. it's difficult, you know. the pain. the effort.}
<C>__{mrs. santiago}
<D>__{i pay more. how much? how much?}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{twenty dollars.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{way to go. milk her for every penny.}
<A>__{oda mae jumps up and stares at her sisters. they look back at her curiously. they can't figure out what's wrong. neither can oda mae. mrs. santiago reaches into her purse. a twenty dollar bill changes hands. sam watches, amazed at it all. oda mae sits down and goes back into her trance. her eyeballs roll up into their sockets.}
<D>__{clara louise praise the lord. thank you, jesus.}
<A>__{oda mae is beginning to shake again. the two women grab her shoulders to keep her from falling out of the chair. suddenly her whole body stiffens.}
<D>__{clara louise}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{have mercy! have mercy!}
<A>__{mrs. santiago stares on in amazement. after a moment oda mae's body collapses in a heap. then, like a phoenix rising from the ashes, she pulls herself up in her chair and assumes a normal pose. after several seconds to get her bearings, oda mae begins to speak. only now she has an entirely new voice. it sounds deep and hoarse, like an old man's. for all its put on theatricality, it is strangely convincing.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{welcome, rosa santiago. you are fortunate today. the channel is clear. many spirits are gathering.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(scanning the room)}
<D>__{yeah? where?}
<A>__{oda mae jerks. her eyes dart nervously around the room.}
<C>__{mrs. santiago}
<D>__{my husband?}
<C>__{oda mae}
<P>__{(a bit uneasy)}
<D>__{i can feel his vibration. yes, yes, he is drawing toward us now. i can see him coming.}
<C>__{mrs. santiago}
<D>__{julio! julio! how is he? how does he look?}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{oh, he is a very handsome man.}
<C>__{mrs. santiago}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{handsome?}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{in our father's kingdom we are all handsome.}
<C>__{mrs. santiago}
<P>__{(understanding)}
<D>__{julio!}
<A>__{sam looks on dismayed.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{he is standing before me. he is wearing a black suit.}
<C>__{mrs. santiago}
<D>__{a black suit? oh yes, yes. he was buried in that.}
<A>__{mrs. santiago begins to cry. sam looks around the room with growing disgust. then he leans over to oda mae and yells into her ear.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what a crock of shit!}
<A>__{oda mae nearly falls off her chair. she spins around.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{who's there?}
<A>__{sam is stunned. clara and louise look at one another in total confusion. this is obviously not part of the act. mrs. santiago seems frightened.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{where are you?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{who?}
<A>__{oda mae screams and jumps up thrashing at the air. her knee kicks the table and sends it toppling. mrs. santiago is terrified.}
<C>__{mrs. santiago}
<D>__{julio! julio!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{get out of here! leave me alone!}
<A>__{mrs. santiago doesn't know what to do. she begins to cry.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{who are you talking to?}
<A>__{clara runs up to oda mae.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{keep him away!}
<A>__{louise looks at the empty room.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{are you talking to me?}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{do something. help me.}
<A>__{clara just stares at her sister. sam is excited and amazed.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i don't believe this. hey you. my name is sam wheat. can you hear me? sam wheat!}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{stop it!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{say my name! sam wheat! say it!}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{talk to me, oda mae. say something.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{sam wheat!}
<A>__{sam nearly falls on his face. clara's eyes widen. she is more confused than ever.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{jesus!}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{samweet?}
<A>__{oda mae runs into the closet. it has a false panel leading to a hidden chamber on the left side and she barricades herself inside it. clara and louise stand outside pulling on the handle. they seem frightened.}
<D>__{clara louise oda mae! oda mae!}
