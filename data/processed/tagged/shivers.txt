<L>__{exterior starliner towers apartment complex morning}
<A>__{starliner towers is seen in ls through the windshield of a moving car. the car approaches the complex and stops near the main doors of the west tower. out of the car climb kresimir and benda sviben, a gawky newly wed young couple. kresimir elaborately opens the door for benda, his new wife, and they walk with hands intertwined up the steps of the west tower.}
<L>__{interior lobby morning}
<A>__{as the svibens approach the main doors, the doorman leaps up from his chair beside the intercom switchboard and opens the door for them. the doorman, like most security guards, does not look capable of handling a serious crisis. he is about fifty, of average height but slightly built, wears thick glasses and seems almost embarrassed by the revolver on his hip.}
<C>__{doorman}
<D>__{morning, folks. can i help you?}
<C>__{kresimir}
<D>__{yes, please. i... er, we... are looking for the rental agent here. we have an appointment.}
<C>__{doorman}
<D>__{ok, i will just give him a little buzz and he'll come out and show you the way in.}
<A>__{the doorman presses a button on the intercom board. as he turns back to the svibens, he catches his holster on the board.}
<C>__{doorman}
<P>__{(freeing holster)}
<D>__{darned thing.}
<C>__{benda}
<D>__{do you ever use that?}
<C>__{doorman}
<D>__{this? no, never even had it out of the holster. a rival company has 'em, so we gotta have 'em. just an advertising gimmick.}
<L>__{interior annabelle's apartment morning}
<A>__{dr. emil hobbes, a huge, florid, bearded man, is strangling annabelle horsefield. despite the difference in their sizes annabelle is tall and slender, about seventeen hobbes is not having an easy time of it. hobbes is wearing overlarge blue jeans and a red plaid shirt; annabelle is in a private girls' school outfit white blouse, dark blue tie, blue knee socks, pleated gray skirt. annabelle fights back fiercely; hobbes has tears in his eyes. the struggle takes them all over her apartment, which, although sparsely furnished, presents enough objects in their way to cause a lot of crashing around. at one point annabelle breaks loose and hobbes has to chase her. annabelle slips and hobbes manages to pin her to the ground, where he has the advantage of leverage. he strangles her quickly and with tremendous, crazy energy. blood oozes from her mouth. hobbes places his hand over her mouth as though trying to prevent her from speaking, or to prevent something from leaving her body. he reaches over to his leather doctor's bag, which has spilled some of its contents on to the floor, finds a surgical clamp, and clamps annabelle's lips together. he then picks up her body, carries it over to the dining room table and sweeps the few cups and bottles on it off on to the floor. he then places her body with great tenderness on the table and begins to undress it.}
<L>__{interior lobby morning}
<A>__{the doorman leaves the svibens to open the door for the spergazzis, an elderly italian couple who both use aluminum, four pronged canes to help them walk. the svibens watch the old couple as they enter and then glance at each other significantly 'we'll be together when we're as old as they are.' mr. spergazzi tips his hat to the doorman, who opens the inner door for him. as the spergazzis make their way shakily toward the elevators, mr. merrick, the rental agent, appears from around a corner. he is slick, mustachioed, and wears a wide paisley tie. he extends his hand for a handshake even though he is still fifty feet from the inner doors. the doorman keeps the door open for him.}
<C>__{doorman}
<D>__{here's mr. merrick. he'll take you on in.}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(ingratiatingly)}
<D>__{welcome to starliner towers. and you are...?}
<C>__{kresimir}
<D>__{kresimir and benda sviben.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{eh? oh yes, of course. mr. and mrs. sweden. come right this way. sorry to keep you waiting. now, are we talking about one or two bedrooms? i assume we're not talking about bachelors, eh? ha, ha. now, i have several floor plans all laid out for you, and all you have to do is take your choice and we'll trot right on up there and take a look at 'em...}
<A>__{the three disappear around a corner. the doorman pulls a harlequin nurse romance out of his jacket and sits down to continue reading it.}
<L>__{interior annabelle's apartment morning}
<A>__{hobbes ties a green surgical mask over his mouth and nose, snaps on rubber gloves. he turns to annabelle's corpse on the dining room table, legs hanging over the edge, now naked the private girls' school clothes in a heap on the floor. hobbes takes a scalpel from the top of the radiator where he has laid out his surgical instruments. he feels annabelle's stomach until he has found what he wants, then cuts her open with one smooth, confident stroke of the scalpel. he then quickly douses the inside of her abdomen with some clear fluid in a squeeze bottle, lights a wooden match, and drops it into her abdominal cavity. the corpse bursts into flame. hobbes steps back to watch. tears spring into his eyes. he picks up another scalpel and perfunctorily sticks it into his neck. blood spurts into his mask and soaks through to the other side. hobbes sinks to his knees before the blazing corpse and struggles to draw the scalpel through the tendons of his neck.}
<L>__{interior rental office morning}
<A>__{merrick and the svibens sit across from each other at a long table strewn with floor plans and maps. the river which surrounds the complex can be seen through the glass walls of the office. merrick taps one plan with his finger and slides it over to benda.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{now you take a look at that one, brenda, and tell me if it doesn't suit you down to the ground. that one has the big view, the panoramic view...}
<L>__{interior tudor's apartment morning}
<A>__{in his bathroom, nicholas tudor is cleaning his teeth with microscopic attention to detail using an elaborate compressed water device called a water pick. tudor is thirty nine, not happy with his work as an insurance appraiser, and has recently adopted a general air of terse, sullen desperation as his primary mood. his wife, janine, calls to him from the kitchen, where she is just putting the finishing touches on breakfast.}
<C>__{janine }
<D>__{breakfast is just about ready, nick.}
<A>__{tudor pointedly doesn't answer, but continues with the water pick until he is completely satisfied. he carefully packs the machine away, then leaves the bathroom. in the dining room, janine is putting breakfast on the table. tudor sits down without a word and begins to eat. janine returns to the kitchen and comes back with a cup of coffee in each hand. she puts one cup in front of tudor, sits down, starts to drink the other one. after a pause, she speaks.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{can i call you at the office?}
<C>__{tudor}
<D>__{what do you want to call me at the office for?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{i don't know. i just thought i might want to call you. i don't know.}
<C>__{tudor}
<D>__{i won't be at the office except to sign in.}
<P>__{(he eats heartily,}
<D>__{not looking directly}
<P>__{at janine)}
<D>__{i've got a lot of claims to check out. all over the place. garages and more garages.}
<P>__{(noticing janine's}
<D>__{silence, he finally}
<P>__{looks up)}
<D>__{i will come home right after work.}
<A>__{janine continues to toy with the food in her plate. she shrugs once, as if to say, 'big deal, so what?' tudor ignores her and finishes breakfast.}
<L>__{interior a hallway morning}
<A>__{tudor leaves his apartment, closing the door behind him (we see the number clearly). he walks down the hallway on automatic pilot, obviously preoccupied, turning the corner leading to the elevators without perceiving what he is seeing. at the elevators he hesitates for a moment, then presses the up button. when the door opens, he steps in.}
<L>__{interior elevator morning}
<A>__{in the elevator are merrick, the rental agent, and the svibens.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{we're going up.}
<C>__{tudor}
<D>__{oh. well, i will go along for the ride.}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(after a pause, to}
<D>__{the svibens, indicating the}
<P>__{elevator)}
<D>__{wood grain paneling, strong, silent, fireproof, fast, cushioned ride. everything you could want in an elevator.}
<A>__{nobody says another word until the doors spring open and merrick, after a wink at tudor, hustles the svibens out of the elevator. as the doors close, merrick's voice floats back to tudor.}
<C>__{merrick }
<D>__{notice how the entranceways to all the apartments are recessed and individually lit... nope, it's down that way, brenda. that's it... recessed and individually lit...}
<A>__{once the door has closed, tudor presses the button for the top floor. as the elevator ascends, he takes out his wallet and removes a key from a zippered compartment.}
<L>__{interior hallway morning}
<A>__{tudor fits the key into the lock of annabelle's apartment. he knocks gently and then opens the door. after a pause he steps in and closes the door behind him, not wanting to be seen by anyone who might know him.}
<L>__{interior annabelle's apartment morning}
<A>__{as soon as he is inside the apartment, tudor knows that something is seriously wrong. smoke hangs in the air and the smell of burned flesh attacks tudor's nostrils. he is on his way to the bedroom when he sees hobbes's foot around the corner of the dining room. tudor approaches the dining room with his hand over his nose and mouth. annabelle's corpse is still smoking where it lies on the dining room table. hobbes's body is twisted into the fetal position at the foot of the table, one hand still clutching the scalpel stuck in its neck, the floor beneath it bright with blood. tudor winces as though stuck with a pin. blinking rapidly, he edges around the room until his angle of vision is such that he can see the head of the corpse on the table. it is definitely annabelle, eyes still staring, surgical clip still attached to her lips, purple bruises on her neck. tudor turns, his body contracting around the pit of his stomach. after a moment he manages to straighten up and stagger from the apartment, having at least enough presence of mind to take his attache case, which he left by the door, and to close the door behind him.}
<L>__{interior annabelle's apartment afternoon}
<A>__{dr. roger st. luc, tall, thin, dark, not bad looking, stands over the table staring at the corpse of annabelle. as he watches, two ambulance men throw a sheet over her and begin to lift her down on to a stretcher on the floor. the voice of the superintendent of the building drifts over to him from the other end of the apartment.}
<C>__{super }
<D>__{like i said to the police officer, he paid the rent, dr. hobbes did. and he came around and chatted a lot with everyone here, the staff, i mean. nice guy. not a high and mighty type. but it was her name on the residency list and the buzzer board: annabelle... what was it again?... annabelle horsefield. she never complained about anything, not to me, anyway.}
<A>__{the super, a small, unshaven, harassed little man with a lot of energy, is talking to a large beefy detective who writes everything down in a notebook.}
<C>__{detective}
<P>__{(pointing to}
<D>__{annabelle's corpse, which is just being}
<P>__{carried out the door)}
<D>__{and that was her. annabelle horse... field.}
<C>__{super}
<D>__{far as i know, yeah, that was her.}
<A>__{the detective now turns to st. luc, who is crouched on the floor examining the chalk outline around where hobbes's body had lain.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{is that the man who called you up here?}
<C>__{super}
<D>__{yeah, that's dr. st. luc. he's the head of our little medical clinic here.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{medical clinic?}
<C>__{super}
<D>__{yeah. this is an island, you know? takes too long to get into the city. we gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{well, let's go talk to your doctor.}
<A>__{the detective walks over to st. luc and the super follows. st. luc rises to meet him. he is wearing very informal summer clothes, a bit rumpled.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{dr. st. luc? detective sergeant heller. i'd like to ask you a few questions.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<P>__{(obviously a bit dazed}
<D>__{by what he has been}
<P>__{seeing)}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{you're the one who found the bodies?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{did you touch anything? move anything before we got here?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{no, nothing.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{you knew these people?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{i knew the man, emil hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. i saw the girl around the building but i didn't know her. she never came to the clinic.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{so you just came up to visit this hobbes and you found them like that?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{oh, no. i haven't seen dr. hobbes since i was in medical school. he taught me... he was my prof in urology and... i think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. that was it. i had no idea he'd ever set foot in starliner towers until today.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{i see. then what brought you up here?}
<A>__{st. luc begins to pace about as he talks.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{it was very strange. he called me at six this morning. hobbes called me. i thought i was dreaming. i haven't heard that voice for so long. he told me who it was, then he said something like, 'meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. i want you to go out for lunch with me. it's time you furthered your education.' then he laughed and hung up. i went back to sleep. he called me again at eight to remind me to come.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{how did he sound this time? was he nervous? depressed?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{he sounded fine.}
<A>__{the telephone rings. the super, who has been fiddling with a window with a cracked pane of glass, grabs the phone instinctively without looking at the detective, who probably would have answered it himself.}
<C>__{super}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{who? no, that's not me. you got the wrong guy. just a sec.}
<P>__{(looks up at st. luc}
<D>__{and holds out the}
<P>__{phone to him)}
<D>__{it's for you. somebody wants to know how come you didn't show up for lunch.}
<A>__{the detective looks suspiciously at st. luc, who simply looks dazed.}
<L>__{interior rollo linsky's laboratory afternoon}
<A>__{next to a shallow porcelain tray full of immense and grotesque marine worm specimens lies a large parcel wrapped in brown paper. rollo's plump fingers eagerly open the package to reveal a large variety of delicatessen sandwiches and accessories. rollo offers some to st. luc while stuffing one in his own mouth. there are cokes and old coffees everywhere, plus mustard, relish, and ketchup dispensers of all kinds. rollo and st. luc sit around rollo's desk, a very sleek metal affair. rollo's lab itself is a combination of modern office and biology room in a museum of natural history. specimens of all kinds, in bottles and cases, mounted on glass and wood, floating in preservative baths, are everywhere. there are also a few cages of living insects, moldy aquaria and lab cultures in various stages of neglect. there are also clippings from magazines and newspapers sporting furious underlinings and circlings in red ink which are stuck to walls, doors, bookshelves. despite the potential for chaos, however, there is an underlying order which reflects rollo's own real discipline, which is not always immediately apparent. and the microscopes and glass slides, the stainless steel gynecological table complete with stirrups, metal drug and instrument cabinet, etc., are spotless and in good shape. rollo is rotund, soft faced, and a manic depressive. in his manic phase he is a joker and an elbow nudger, and his general style, even when discussing medical matters in medical jargon, is broad north american jewish. in his depressive phase, he becomes a sullen kid who has an oddly sinister aspect to his character. rollo detaches himself from his baby beef in order to comment on the food that, not so secretly, he loves best of all.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{not exactly the kind of lunch hobbes would have laid on you, rog, but it's all i got, and...}
<P>__{(places hand on heart,}
<D>__{leans over}
<P>__{confidentially)}
<D>__{...all i got i share with you. go ahead. take all you want.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{you touch my spleen, rollo.}
<P>__{(they giggle at an}
<D>__{old medical school}
<P>__{reference)}
<D>__{and here all the time i was thinking if i ever bothered to think about the good old days well, at least there's rollo. he's in vd and he's happy.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{i'm still a vd man under the skin, rog. you know me. i'm a down to earth kinda guy, right?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{well, at least you still talk the same.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{so who changes?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{but you gave up your private practice. suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{that was my father's idea... private practice. he wanted to set me up i couldn't say no. but he's dead now. and me, i'm still a snoop, i gotta do research. look at that beautiful stuff...}
<P>__{(gestures everywhere)}
<D>__{...lookit it!}
<A>__{he jams a final piece of sandwich into his mouth and jumps to his feet, smiling broadly.}
<C>__{rollo}
<P>__{(with great enthusiasm,}
<D>__{indicating the entire}
<P>__{lab)}
<D>__{this is the 'satyr's tongue'!}
<A>__{he pulls a book off a shelf with a bookmark in it. he opens the book at the marked page and hands it to st. luc. as st. luc looks at the picture of a satyr with his tongue hanging out and reads the brief note on how medieval alchemists thought the ground up tongue of the satyr could cure any disease, rollo continues to talk.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{the note includes a warning against swallowing the tongue whole, but we don't see the rest of this caution. 'satyr's tongue' was hobbes's code name for our project. what we were trying to do was to find an alternative to organ transplants.}
<A>__{as rollo speaks, he walks all over the place, picking up and discarding various charts, specimens, bottled and diseased human organs, etc. as he moves around, we catch glimpses of letrasetted signs that rollo has tacked up: 'sex is the invention of a clever venereal disease hobbes'; 'dr. hobbes's prescription: starve a fever, feed an obsession'; 'the road of excess leads to knowledge'; plus several pictures of satyrs with their tongues sticking out, being cut off by alchemists, etc.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{i know. you're bored already. transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<P>__{(shaking his head in protest)}
<D>__{did i say anything?}
<C>__{rollo}
<P>__{(excited, waving}
<D>__{specimens of parasites and diseased organs}
<P>__{around)}
<D>__{look. you got men, you got parasites that live in, on, and around men. now. why not breed a parasite that does something useful? eh? why not breed a parasite capable of taking over the function of any one of a bunch of human organs? why not, for example, a parasite living in the human abdominal cavity that plugs into the circulatory system and filters the blood like a kidney? if it takes a little blood for itself, so what? be generous! you can afford it.}
<A>__{he is now in full flight. he leans over st. luc and begins to demonstrate what he says by drawing things on st. luc's stomach with his fingers. st. luc can't hide his amusement.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{you put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. i know what you're gonna say. you're gonna say it's crazy.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{it's crazy.}
<A>__{rollo throws himself back into his chair and grabs a pickle.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{right. it's crazy. but here's the beauty part. ready?}
<P>__{(leans forward for emphasis)}
<D>__{who cares?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{i don't get it.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{you know and i know that hobbes was a lousy teacher, eh? lousy. dry, academic, afraid of women, lousy. but he was always a genius at one thing getting grants. could he get grants for crazy projects?}
<A>__{st. luc is about to say something, but rollo answers his own rhetorical question with a flip of the hand, effectively silencing st. luc.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{you know who pays the rent here? eh? the northern hemisphere organ transplant society. and that's for something that's supposed to put them outta business. and they're not the only ones. we got grant money coming out of our ears.}
<A>__{he leaps up again and pulls a sheaf of reprints from medical journals like the journal of venereal disease, etc. he shoves them under st. luc's nose, then grabs a jar with a disintegrating octopus like creature in it and a sandwich at the same time. he smacks down the sandwich in front of st. luc by mistake, then retrieves it and substitutes the jar with the specimen. st. luc sifts through the papers and glances at the specimen. as st. luc looks at the papers, rollo breathes heavily down his neck and points out things of interest.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{see? there? you take a little of this... that's a very rare venereal disease you get in the nomadic crinua people, northeast asia and japan.}
<P>__{(points to a sexy}

<P>__{lady in heat)}
<D>__{oo. that one's got it bad. they call it batinh. that means 'kiss' or 'caress.' when you get it it makes your lips itchy, ya wanta kiss everything. i even had it once. i always get everything at least once so i know what the patient's talking about.}
<P>__{(he laughs but he's serious)}
<D>__{and there... you take a little of that... that's beautiful, isn't it? that's flexipes, the world's only cephalopod parasite.}
<P>__{(indicating the jar)}
<D>__{that's him right there. not a very good specimen. related to squids and octopuses. see? he lives in the guts of whales and big dolphins.}
<P>__{(wiggles a finger at the specimen)}
<D>__{ya like 'em big 'n hot 'n wet, don't ya? yeah.}
<A>__{he walks away from the desk. his manner is now more subdued and reflective. it seems as though everything he says provokes a dozen unspoken thoughts. his depressive phase is beginning.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{we don't do it all here, we send out to have tricky stuff done... the cell fusion, enucleation, chromosomal fission, all that fancy close work.}
<A>__{rollo sighs heavily. st. luc gently shoves all the papers aside.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{rollo, how come hobbes killed himself?}
<A>__{rollo toys with the gynecological examination table, sliding the stirrups in and out on their adjustment bars.}
<C>__{rollo}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{funny in the head. high suicide rate in the medical profession. too much body, alla time bodies, bodies.}
<A>__{he now gets close to st. luc, putting an arm around his shoulder.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{rog, i gotta talk serious to you. really. listen. ya listening? ok. i want you to come into this with me. to tell the honest to god truth, i'm lonely.}
<P>__{(begins to pace around again)}
<D>__{all hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. he wanted you in anyway. that's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. we would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.}

<L>__{exterior tudor's balcony night}
<A>__{tudor hangs on to the railing of the narrow concrete balcony, gulping down the air, scanning the lights of the tower opposite. suddenly the muscles of his neck go tense again, his mouth seems to gape open at the extreme limits imposed by muscle and jawbone, his hands fly up to his mouth in an attempt to keep down whatever is about to come up. hanging over the railing of the balcony like an ocean traveler in a rough sea, tudor finally gives up the struggle and hangs on for dear life as he retches, gags, moans, and finally vomits.}

<A>__{two elderly women, vi and olive, are taking a leisurely evening stroll at the base of tudor's tower. they both hold small transparent umbrellas over their heads and walk gingerly along the path bordering the lawn. suddenly the liquid, fleshy thwack of the parasite vomited by tudor from high above hitting one of the umbrellas is heard. a large splotch of blood spatters the first lady's umbrella just off center, as though it has been hit by a heavy, blood soaked sponge. the force of the blow almost twists the umbrella from the first lady's frail hand, and she gives a little cry of surprise. her companion extends a hand to help the first lady keep her balance, then gives a slightly more startled cry when she sees the blood. the first lady examines her umbrella as well, but does not react with such surprise.}

<D>__{listen, rog. i knew hobbes was funny, you know? i told you that. but i didn't really know just how funny he was. see... when he kicked off, they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother she's still alive but just barely and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab. i'm hobbes's partner, right?}
<P>__{(laughs sardonically)}
<D>__{anyway, i've been going through his papers, and what they add up to is this: hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university, the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody. we never really knew what it was we were working on. hobbes gave us each a few crumbs, but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like.}

<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{hobbes thought that man is an animal that thinks too much, an animal that has lost touch with his instinct, his 'primal self'... in other words, too much brain and not enough guts. and what he came up with to help our guts along was a human parasite that is... lemme find it here... 'a combination of aphrodisiac and venereal disease, a modern version of the satyr's tongue.'}

<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{but the important thing for you is this: hobbes used annabelle as a guinea pig. he implanted her with the thing. i figure that once the parasites took, annabelle went berserk. i dunno what she did, but hobbes wasn't ready for it. he had to kill her. and he wasn't trying to burn her, he was burning them, all of them.}

<A>__{the parasite is now half out of her mouth, hanging through the slit it has torn in her gag. st. luc lets go of forsythe and she sinks to the floor. the residents are swarming all over them. st. luc abandons forsythe and begins to fight his way up the stairs. he runs higher and higher, up flight after flight of stairs, until he is free of the slow moving residents. he leans back against a wall, panting. crooning and moaning echo up to him from below. he leans over the railing and looks down. in the stairwell several flights below, forsythe lies surrounded by milling residents, legs spread as though about to give birth. a resident leans over and pulls the parasite from her mouth, then swallows it whole with gusto. other residents touch her, stroke her, caress her, as though offering her a strange kind of comfort. st. luc reels with disgust and disbelief. he turns and runs.}
<L>__{interior swimming pool night}
<A>__{between the two towers lies the swimming pool. st. luc manages to reach the door leading from the south tower into the pool. he hangs on to the door of the pool itself for a moment in near exhaustion, then opens it and enters. the pool is dim and tranquil. two women are swimming in the deep end as though nothing were at all abnormal. st. luc watches them for a moment, enjoying the apparent normalcy of the scene. then he staggers forward, calling out to the swimmers.}

<A>__{the swimmers both flick playfully beneath the water's surface. st. luc approaches the water's edge, waiting for them to surface. the water ripples and bubbles near his feet. a sinking feeling comes over him. he watches in horrible fascination. he begins to shiver. the ripples and bubbles spread and intensify. after a pause, janine surfaces, smiling radiantly. a few seconds later, betts surfaces near her, the very picture of benign, watery calm. betts gestures to st. luc to join them in the pool. st. luc shakes his head slowly, backing away from the pool. he turns to leave the room. as he turns, mr. spergazzi appears out of the shadows behind him. using his four pronged aluminum cane, he pushes st. luc backwards into the pool, chuckling playfully. spergazzi looks around for approval as st. luc begins to thrash about wildly. betts swims up beside st. luc, grabs him, and holds him under.}

<A>__{betts allows st. luc to rise to the surface as a laughing janine splashes over to him and fastens her mouth to his. as they kiss, janine's hands hold st. luc's head fiercely. betts assists her by pinning st. luc's arms behind him. janine's throat ripples and swells, her cheeks billow as a parasite swarms upwards from deep within her body. st. luc's cheeks now swell as the parasite enters his mouth. his eyes jolt open in terror and he manages to pull away slightly, revealing the tentacles joining her mouth to his like grappling irons. st. luc twists out of betts' grasp. he and janine, still locked together, sink beneath the surface. dozens of residents pour into the pool room and join spergazzi and the others at the poolside. among these are faces already familiar to us: kurt, kresimir and benda, the old laundry room woman, etc. the new spectators clap, laugh, croon, and moan as though witnessing a wild group baptism. some of them throw themselves into the water, pulling others in with them. deep under the water's surface, st. luc still struggles to free himself from janine. residents now splash into the depths all around them. st. luc's cheeks bulge wide and blood dribbles from his nose and mouth. his throat swells monstrously. janine releases him just in time for us to see the end of a tentacle slip back into his mouth. he exhales heavily as parasite enzymes pump furiously through his body. the water boils with his exhaled breath. janine and st. luc drift apart, now completely calm, as residents splash and swim, kick and embrace.}

<A>__{the vast and dimly lit garage is full of silent cars. somewhere an engine starts up, then another and another, until the whole garage is full of fumes and the revving of engines. as we prowl amongst the cars we find many of the residents we already know, now dressed to the teeth in their seductive best. mr. spergazzi and his wife stand and watch the spectacle, canes in hand, with great dignity. with them stand others who are too old or too young to go into the night looking for new hosts for their parasites, content to remain incubators for the time being. the residents are full of bubbly anticipation in their cars. kresimir leans out of his car and shouts to no one in particular.}
