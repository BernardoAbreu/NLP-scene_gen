<A>__{jim enters the back door and sets his satchel down in the usual place. he opens the refrigerator, grabs a beer. as he closes the door, something catches his eye. he reaches inside and throws a plastic container away. rooting around noisily, he finds other things to dispose of. suddenly a baby cry stops him cold. jim stiffens, his good eye widening as the horrible truth sinks in. he carefully closes the refrigerator and tiptoes toward the living room.}
