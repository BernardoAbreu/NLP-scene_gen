<L>__{exterior "the wurrfler" conning tower day}
<A>__{the nazis have returned to their subs. shliemann is on the bridge with the wurrfler's captain and the captain's aides. the captain is an honorable career navy man.}
<C>__{the wurrfler's captain}
<D>__{colonel shliemann, all torpedoes are loaded.}
<A>__{shliemann nods and continues to stare at the bantu wind, as does the captain. the pirate crew is all lined across the bow. towering above the others, standing on the rail, proud and defiant, is katanga. shliemann looks at the wurrfler's captain a moment.}
<C>__{shliemann}
<D>__{what do you think, captain?}
<C>__{the wurrfler's captain}
<P>__{(earnestly)}
<D>__{i think not, colonel. nothing is to be gained. we are not at war.}
<A>__{shliemann mulls this, then turns to the hatch.}
<C>__{shliemann}
<D>__{...yet. let the vermin live. we must be on our way.}
<A>__{shliemann disappears down the hatch. the captain is very pleased. a radioman speaks into his headset, then follows the other aides down the hatch. in the distance the other subs begin to move away from the ship. the captain, alone on the bridge, looks once more at katanga. on the bantu wind, katanga executes what might be taken for a salute. the wurrfler's captain smiles, salutes crisply, then goes below, pulling the hatch closed. immediately, the wurrfler begins to move. and as it does, we see the rail at the aft of the main deck. from nowhere, a wet sleeve appears and a hand grabs the rail! indy pulls his dripping body onto the sub's main deck. he has lost his felt hat once and for all. other than that, his outfit is the same as always, just wetter. suddenly, water is washing over his feet; the wurrfler is beginning to submerge. indy runs through quickly deepening water toward the haven of the conning tower. halfway there, he slips and goes down. only by grabbing the base of the aftmast light does he keep from being swept away. he struggles to his feet and sloshes through knee deep water to the base of the conning tower. indy climbs the ladder to the bridge of the conning tower and looks down. the water is rising toward his fast. indy climbs the ladder to the top of the turret and braces himself between the two uprights there the 7 foot radio mast and the 20 foot periscope. still the ocean comes up to meet him. soon the top of the turret is under water and the radio mast is disappearing. indy shifts his grip to the periscope, working his way up it and hanging on for dear life as the ocean whips at his body. the periscope is quickly going under. indy hangs on to the top three feet, all that remains above. the forward movement of the sub continues, but, to indy's slowly dawning delight, the dive stops. no more of the periscope goes under. indy smiles; it's a pretty good smile, too, given the circumstances. indy pulls out his bullwhip and begins tying himself to the periscope.}
