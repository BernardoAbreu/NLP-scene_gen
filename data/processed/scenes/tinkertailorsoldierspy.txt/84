<C>__{connie sachs }
<D>__{i went straight to esterhase and alleline. i said "polyakov is a karla trained hood if ever i saw one. and if he's here it's because he's running a mole."}

<D>__{what did they say?}
<A>__{alleline switches off the image.}
<C>__{percy alleline}
<P>__{(hard)}
<D>__{you're to leave polyakov alone. you're becoming obsessed with him.}
<A>__{he glances at esterhase and then back to connie, eyes cold.}
