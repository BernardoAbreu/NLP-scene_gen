<L>__{exterior norwegian fjords late afternoon}
<A>__{we're looking down at a ship moving through the fjord, seen from high above. it's towing a smaller boat behind it. an airplane? no, we're at the top of the trollveggen, norway's legendary "troll wall". it's a near 5,000 foot sheer drop to the ocean. six figures stand at the edge of the barren cliff. they wear webbed "squirrel" jumpsuits, helmets and parachutes. on each thigh they have pistols and on their chests they have silenced mp 5 sub machine guns. together they stare down at the ship. petra is among them. she looks down at her watch. it is precisely 5:59pm. she glances around. the top of the cliff is rocky and flat. xander is nowhere to be seen. fifty yards away we see xander sneaking forward military style. he's got his "stakeout suit" on and is keeping low. he checks his watch: "6 pm" the members of anarchy 99 put on their goggles and, without saying a word, they leap off the troll wall. xander runs to the edge and looks down. he sees the group freefailing down the sheer cliff face.}

<D>__{very nice.}
<A>__{the six plummet away from him at incredible speed. in a hard arch, they peak at 120 m.p.h. then, using the webbed wings under their arms and between their legs, they go into aerodynamic "track" positions and rocket away from the wall. like dark angels, they soar out over the water in formation. on the ship below the ship below is a scientific research vessel. on the deck, a few sailors and scientists watch the sun set. the six dark figures close in rapidly. at the last moment they pull their chutes and deftly glide towards the ship. a sailor looks up and spots them. before he can shout, he's shot in the leg and goes down. seconds later, they're on the deck, tearing off their rigs. they race across the deck, taking over the ship in a surgical manner. they herd everyone back heading for the bridge. petra hangs back. she looks back at the cliff, up towards xander. xander's p.o.v. through his super binoculars we see them storming the bridge. as they head inside, they disappear from view. xander hits a button on the side of the binoculars.}
