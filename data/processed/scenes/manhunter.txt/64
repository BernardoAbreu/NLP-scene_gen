<D>__{i love it. sweet jesus, yes come on, can.}
<A>__{he photographs its placement with the camera on his belt, bracketing exposures. then he tears a small branch and uses it to put the can in an evidence bag. graham climbs higher until his foot is level to where he saw the mud. he looks to his left. something he sees stops him cold.}

<D>__{didn't you, you son of a bitch! you watched them all goddamn day long! !}
