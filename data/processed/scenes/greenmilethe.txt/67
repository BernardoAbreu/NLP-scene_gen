<L>__{exterior cold mountain penitentiary day}
<A>__{the prison truck appears, swaying along the rutted road...}
<B>__{in the truck}
<A>__{...while billy wharton stares at nothing, drool dripping from his slack mouth in long strings.}
<L>__{interior e block day}
<A>__{paul watches the truck pull in. he draws away from the slot, proceeds toward the empty cell which used to be bitterbuck's...}
<B>__{angle on truck}
<A>__{the rear doors are swung open. harry emerges. dean and percy are guiding billy by the arm, helping him down...}
<B>__{inside e block}
<A>__{paul waits at the empty cell. angle pans tight to coffey at his bars, eyes widening in a blossoming of some nameless fear or dread. something bad's coming. a whisper:}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{careful.}
<B>__{outside e block}
<A>__{billy is brought to the door. dean pulls his keys, starts to unlock it. we push in on billy's face, where the tiniest trace of a smile is starting to grow...}
<B>__{inside e block}
<A>__{...and coffey's unease grows with it. he presses his face to the bars, his whispering becoming more urgent:}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{careful. careful.}
<A>__{paul hears him, glances back with a puzzled look. coffey's gaze is directed at the door, which is being unlocked...}
<B>__{the door}
<A>__{...and opened. in that moment, the slack look on billy's face gives way to a wild grin. a crazed screech leaps from his throat, a cross between a rebel yell and a dog being tortured, freezing everybody's blood in their veins }
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{yeeeeeeehaaaawwwwwwrooooo!}
<A>__{ and he drops his wrist chain down over dean's head, jerks it tight, begins to strangle him. dean lurches forward, billy riding propelling him through the door onto the mile. percy stands frozen in the doorway, stunned. harry shoves him aside and jumps on billy from behind, trying to get him off dean. dean is choking, turning purple. paul rushes from the cell to join the fray. billy whirls, delivering a stunning kick to paul's groin. paul's bladder pain goes nuclear he falls back in agony, clutching himself and sucking air through his teeth, unable even to scream. billy rams an elbow into harry's face, knocks him sprawling on the desk, screaming and laughing and howling all the while:}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{whoooee, boys! ain't this a party, now? is it, or what?}
<A>__{paul forces himself to his feet, pulls his revolver, draws down on billy...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{let him go!}
<A>__{...but billy jerks dean around, using him as a shield...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{g'wan, shoot! see who ya hit!}
<A>__{dean is choking, dying. paul is shifting his aim, trying for a clear shot, not getting one. percy's still just inside the doorway, pressed against the wall with fear...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hit him, percy! goddamn it, hit him!}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{c'mon, percy, hit me! hit me, you limp noodle, hit me! yeehawww!}
<A>__{...and suddenly a hand comes in, grabs the hickory stick out of percy's grasp, raises it high it's brutal coming through the door. he swings the baton and lands an awesome blow to billy's head thump! the force of it spins billy off his feet and slams him flat on his back. dean crawls away, gulping ragged breaths of air. amazingly, billy's still conscious he looks up at brutal and laughs:}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{big fucker. snuck up on me. no fair.}
<A>__{still laughing, he makes another grab at dean. brutal whacks him again, turning his lights out for good. brutal drops to dean's side, helping him hack air back into his lungs:}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{breathe...breathe...that's it...}
<A>__{everybody's reining in their adrenaline. paul glares at harry.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{we thought he was doped.}
<P>__{(to percy)}
<D>__{didn't we? didn't we all of us think he was doped?}
<A>__{percy nods, still numb. paul is furious:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you didn't ask? i guess that's not a mistake you'll be need to make again anytime soon, is it?}
<A>__{harry shakes his head miserably. paul grabs billy by the feet.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{grab his arms! you too, percy!}
<P>__{(off percy's hesitation)}
<D>__{percy, goddamn it, get your feet out of cement and help us out here!}
<A>__{percy finally unfreezes. the three of them hoist billy up in a dead lift, get him in his cell, toss him on the cot. they step out, slam the door, lock it. paul looks to harry and brutal.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{get dean looked at right away, make sure he's all right. percy, you go make a report to the warden for me. start off by saying the situation is under control it's not a story, he won't appreciate you drawing out the suspense.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{what about you? you look about ready to collapse.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i've got the mile till you all get back. go on now.}
<A>__{they all exit. as soon as he's alone, paul gives in to the pain, holding his crotch and sinking to his knees with a moan. it's so bad he actually lays down on the mile, face pressed against the cool linoleum, wishing he were dead. a stretch of silence...and then:}
<C>__{coffey }
<D>__{boss? needs ta see ya down here.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{this is not a good time, john coffey. not a good time at all.}
<C>__{coffey }
<D>__{but i needs ta see ya, boss. i needs ta talk t'ya.}
<A>__{paul sighs. things couldn't get much worse than this. he rises with a supreme effort, walks painfully down the mile... coffey's cell ...and finds coffey waiting at his bars.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{closer.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm alone here right now, john. figure this is close enough.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{boss, please. i got to whisper in your ear.}
<A>__{paul blinks. maybe it's the fever clouding his brain, or maybe...hell, is this what being hypnotized is like? he tries to shake the sensation off, comes a little closer.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{boss? you know you not s'pose to do dat.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{mind your business, del. what do you want, john coffey?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{just to help.}
<A>__{his hand shoots out, grabs paul by the collar, jerks him close. paul makes a panic grab for his revolver... ...but coffey lays his free hand atop paul's, eases his grip from the gun no need for that. coffey's hand then drifts slowly down, easing to paul's crotch...}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(stunned, frozen)}
<D>__{what are you...doing?}
<A>__{...and something goes whump through paul's body. he arches back with his mouth agape and arms outstretched as a rush of energy seems to pass from paul through coffey's hand... ...and then it's over. paul comes back to the real world, weak against the bars, realizes del is hollering in his cell:}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{help! john coffey's killing boss edgecomb! help!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{del, chrissake, settle down, i'm fine...}
<A>__{it dawns on him that he really is fine. fever's gone. so is the pain in his groin. john coffey, though, seems to be having trouble. he sits down on his bunk, bends forward, gagging like a man with a chicken bone caught in his throat.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{john? john, what's wrong?}
<A>__{paul fumbles his keys to the lock, unsure if he should open the door, watching the big man's contortions grow stronger like a cat trying to cough up a hairball... ...and then comes an unpleasant, gagging retching sound as coffey's lips draw back from his teeth in a kind of godawful sneer...and he exhales a cloud of what look like tiny black insects. they swirl furiously in front of his face, turn white...and disappear. paul just stares, stunned. softly:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what did you do, big boy? what did you do to me?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{i helped it. didn't i help it?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes, but...how?}
<A>__{coffey shrugs it's something that just is.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{just took it back, is all. awful tired now, boss. dog tired.}
<A>__{he rolls onto his bunk, faces the wall. paul just stares at him, stunned. he turns and walks up the mile, his stiffness and pain now gone. del watches him go by, also stunned:}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{what dat man do to you? he throw some gris gris on you?}
<P>__{(off paul's look)}
<D>__{you look diff'int! even walk diff'interior like y'all better!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you're imagining thing. lie down, del. get you some rest.}
<A>__{paul continues up the mile...}
<B>__{e block toilet}
<A>__{...and steps back into the toilet. not trusting this situation for even a moment, paul opens his fly, takes a deep breath to prepare himself for the pain, starts to pee... ...and we hear a healthy stream of water hitting the bowl. the look on paul's face says it all blessed relief.}
