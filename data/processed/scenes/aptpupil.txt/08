<D>__{nowadays you have to... soften it.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{why do i care about this?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{because, i don't want it softened.}
<A>__{todd hops up and begins to pace the floor. dussander stares at him blankly, unsure of where this is going.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i am sure you trouble your parents to no end.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{actually, i'm pretty low maintenance. that's what my dad says.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{you told your parents about me, then?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you think i'm crazy?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i think you're crackers, but go on. i'm riveted.}
<A>__{todd looks deep into dussander's eyes. dussander is uncomfortable. slowly, todd reaches out and brushes his finger against dussander's hand. dussander gets up.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{and then it happened... i was on my way to the library. it was raining...}
<A>__{flashback: interior city bus day todd's voice narrates what we are seeing. todd, seated near the back of the bus, watches dussander climb aboard. todd thinks nothing of it at first, but soon finds that he is unable to take his eyes off him. todd is trying to place the old man's face in his mind...}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{you climbed on the bus and started this slow walk down the aisle. just like you were examining a new batch of inmates. i don't think anybody gave you a second glance but me, but somehow ...people seemed to move out of your way. and under your arm you carried a rolled up umbrella. but what really did it, what really set me off was the coat. you were wearing this long black rain coat. my mind suddenly flipped back to a picture of you taken at patin. you in your s.s. greatcoat with a riding crop under your arm.}
