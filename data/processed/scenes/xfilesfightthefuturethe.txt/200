<B>__{corridor}
<A>__{scully's head pokes through now, as she's pushed through the opening that mulder used earlier to get into the vaulted arena. pushed in fits and starts until she's all the way through. mulder now straining and squeezing to do the same on his own. the corridor is filled with heavy condensed mist now as mulder finally slips out of the low passageway, trying to get his bearing now as he huddles low over scully. turning his attention to her as she coughs hoarsely in some kind of acute spasm of pain but alive.}

<D>__{we've got to keep moving.}
<C>__{scully}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{where are we?}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{you got me. but i think i know what they did with jimmy hoffa.}
<A>__{scully is struggling now as mulder tries to pull her to her feet again. in real physical pain.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{i can't...}
<A>__{scully can't finish speaking, her voice becoming a hoarse cough.}

<P>__{(barely a whisper)}

<D>__{yes you can. you're going to make it, scully.}
<A>__{mulder hauling scully up off the floor away from camera now.}
<B>__{new angle on ribbed corridor}
<A>__{camera moving through space in the empty corridor, moving at a speed equal to mulder and scully's as they round the semi circular ribbed corridor to meet us. coming out of the mist, scully back in the fireman's carry. approaching the place where mulder slipped down into the corridor. mulder stopping and seeing:}
<B>__{the body in the melting ice lith}
<A>__{as it too moves, the embryonic creature inside it turning slightly, as if coming awake.}
<B>__{reverse on mulder}
<A>__{reacting to this and then to scully who suddenly starts gasping for breath. falling now from mulder's grasps as her legs buckle and she goes down.}
<B>__{low angle on scully}
<A>__{her face is going red, straining for air. her eyes rolling, seeking relief. as mulder drops down beside her.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{shit }
<A>__{but she is unable to answer. mulder hastening to unzip her his jacket. to get to her neck and find a pulse.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{scully }
<A>__{mulder cannot find a pulse. scully straining harder now as mulder reaches his fingers into her mouth, clearing her passageway. moving on top of her now, and pumping forcefully on her chest trying to get air into her. one two three. and putting his mouth down to hers (finally!), breathing his life into her. pulling away from her to see that he is unsuccessful at this that scully is continuing to strain. pumping her chest again }
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{you're not dying on me now godammit godammit godammit }
<A>__{as he pumps her chest. placing his mouth over hers again and breath breath breath. lifting his mouth from hers, feeling for a pulse again, putting his eat down to her mouth, praying he'll feel the breeze of a breath. nothing. while:}
<B>__{angle over him to the creature in the icy pod}
<A>__{as it moves again, more violently now. as the ice around it continues to melt and fissure.}
<B>__{resume mulder}
<A>__{his hands going to a pocket on the inside of the jacket scully is wearing his jacket finding again the syringe that he used on scully. it is still partially full of vaccine. mulder finding this, getting ready to use it when scully's body suddenly comes back to life beneath him. labored breaths which turn into a coughing spasm. mulder breaths relievedly for a moment, watching scully coughing, coming back to life. her eyes trying to focus on him, finding him. seeing his labored relief. the panic melting away.}
<C>__{scully}
<P>__{(weakly, pained whisper)}
<D>__{mulder...}
<A>__{she wants to tell him something. he leans down next to her.}
<C>__{scully}
<P>__{(continued weak)}
<D>__{had you big time.}
<A>__{mulder has but a moment to savor this weary victory though when he reacts to something, that causes him to}
<B>__{whip his head around.}
<A>__{mulder's pov down ribbed corridor through the condensed mist he can see creatures beginning to hatch, sprouting from the melted ice encased bodies they have gestated in. their three fingered hands beating at the soft ice. their powerful feet kicking at it, too.}

<A>__{looking the other way down the corridor, seeing }
<B>__{more creatures}
<A>__{the slushy material that makes up the inner core spilling out with them as the creatures kick out of their tombs.}
<B>__{resume mulder}
<A>__{lifting scully up with all his strength he has left in him. he's got to get her overhead now, back up the venting that he slipped down from. she is weak and of little help. mulder gets her propped up on his strength so that he can use the power of his legs to boost her toward the opening. which puts him face to face with the embryonic creature. its eye looking directly at him, blinking, before it goes into another fitful spasm inside its host body.}
<B>__{angle down from vent}
<A>__{where scully is boosted up toward camera. her hands reaching feebly for something to grab onto. finding a handhold.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{keep breathing, scully.}
<A>__{she utters something guttural, unintelligible as the next thrust up from mulder gets her head and shoulders into the opening of the vent.}
<B>__{resume mulder}
<A>__{beneath her, pushing with all his might. his hands under her shoes now, forcing her up into the vent like a rolled carpet into the rafters.}
<B>__{resume scully}
<A>__{struggling with her arms and elbows, barely conscious, but somehow able to manage herself forward.}
<B>__{resume mulder}
<A>__{pushing scully up the last little way. then reaching up to find a handhold for himself. grabbing hold and lifting himself as one of his feet kicks at the ice where the creature he was just face to face with bursts from its icy pod. one hand, then the other shooting out of the ice where they have broken through the host. ripping open the front of the body, including the man's face. making a slimy, gaping tear in what was formerly flesh. its hands grabbing at mulder as he thrashes to free himself from it getting a grip. as mulder struggles to pull himself up, fighting off the creature which he cannot see beneath him.}
<B>__{resume creature}
<A>__{as it emerges from the ice, still grasping and tearing at mulder's legs with its claws. but as it bursts completely from its place, mulder is able to pull himself up and into the vent in one athletic movement. angle from inside the vent scully lies motionless in the ducting, her body forced forward by mulder's in this last surging move.}
<B>__{tight angle on mulder}
<A>__{drawing his legs up quickly inside. not wasting a moment shoving scully's butt forward in front of him.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{scully you breathing?}

<A>__{letting out another low, guttural sound which strains out of her with each push forward.}
