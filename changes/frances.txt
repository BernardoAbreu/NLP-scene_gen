<ACTION_ALT>__{PROLOGUE}
<ACTION>__{BLACK. We HEAR the soft voice of Frances Farmer.}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{No one ever came up to me and said, 'You're a fool. There isn't such a thing as God. Somebody's been stuffing you.'}
<TRANS>__{FADE IN:}
<LOC>__{EXT. PUGET SOUND - DAY}
<ACTION>__{On an expanse of water, calm and undisturbed. After a moment, it begins to ripple as something rises toward the surface. A girl's face breaks through.}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{It wasn't a murder. I think God just died of old age. And when I realized He wasn't any more, it didn't shock me. It seemed natural and right.}
<ACTION>__{The girl, FRANCES, is 16, blond, very pretty: she seems like the most persuasive proof imaginable of God's existence. She swims toward the shore with long graceful strokes... then climbs the steps of the old wood jetty on West Point Beach.}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{And yet I began to wonder what the minister meant when he said, 'God, the Father, sees even the smallest sparrow fall. He watches over all his children.' That jumbled it all up for me.}
<LOC>__{EXT. PUGET SOUND - LATER}
<ACTION>__{The banks of Puget Sound, dotted with elm trees. Frances sits comfortably in the fork of a tree writing in her diary. Towel around her neck, her hair splayed out and drying golden in the sun.}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{But still sometimes I found that God was useful to remember, especially when I lost things that were important. 'Please God, let me find my red hat with the blue trimmings.'}
<LOC>__{INT. FARMER HOME - FAMILY ROOM - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{Frances is now reading aloud from her diary, gently swaying back and forth in a rocking chair. An older woman, LILLIAN FARMER, sits opposite on the couch, listening and nodding from time to time. A small suitcase stands by the front door.}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It usually worked. God became a superfather that couldn't spank me. But if I wanted a thing badly enough, He arranged it.}
<ACTION>__{ERNEST FARMER appears in the doorway and hesitates, listening to his daughter read.}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But if God loved all of His children equally, why did He bother about my red hat and let other people lose their fathers and mothers for always?}
<ACTION>__{Ernest goes to Frances and kisses her softly on the top of her head. She looks at him briefly, smiling slightly.}
<CHAR>__{ERNEST} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Bye, baby.}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{See you next weekend, Dad.}
<ACTION>__{He goes to the door and picks up his suitcase, glances at Lillian. She doesn't look up. He leaves.}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I began to see that He didn't have much to do about hats or people dying or anything. They happened whether He wanted them to or not, and He stayed in Heaven and pretended not to notice.}
<TRANS>__{DISSOLVE TO:}
<LOC>__{INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Frances stands at a podium. Other STUDENTS and TEACHERS sit to either side of her on folding chairs. Above the proscenium is engraved: West Seattle High School. Below that a banner hangs: "NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL ESSAY COMPETITION, 1931."}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I wondered a little why God was such a useless thing. It seemed a waste of time to have Him. After that He became less and less, until He was... nothingness.}
<ACTION>__{The AUDIENCE consists of parents, students, and local dignitaries. We SEE several shocked faces. Lillian is there also, smiling. Seated next to her is a distinguished-looking woman, ALMA STYLES. Ernest sits on the other side of the auditorium, looking a little worried.}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I felt rather proud that I had found the truth myself, without help from anyone. It puzzled me that other people hadn't found out, too. God was gone. We had reached past Him. Why couldn't they see it? It still puzzles me.}
<ACTION>__{Frances closes her notebook and looks up, waiting for some response. There is a deep shocked silence, then a smattering of applause. Lillian claps enthusiastically, then rises to her feet. In the back a WOMAN also stands.}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're going straight to hell, Frances Farmer!}
<ACTION>__{A stately man sitting next to her, her husband JUDGE BENJAMIN HILLIER, puts a restraining hand on her arm. The woman continues to glare at Frances. Frances stares back, dumbfounded.}
<TRANS>__{SMASH CUT TO:}
<LOC>__{EXT. SEATTLE STREETS - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The screen erupts into violence. A large unruly MOB skirmishes with POLICE in a cobblestoned square. On a truckbed addressing the crowd -- which carries placards reading: "Organize Now!", "Workers of the World Unite!", and "Elect Kaminski!" stands MARTONI KAMINSKI. By his side, leading the crowd's responses, stands a younger man with sharp piercing eyes, HARRY YORK.}
<CHAR>__{KAMINSKI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family? YORK & CROWD No!}
<CHAR>__{KAMINSKI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children? YORK & CROWD No!}
<CHAR>__{KAMINSKI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country? YORK & CROWD No! No!}
<CHAR>__{KAMINSKI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Good! Because, Brothers, that's you!}
<ACTION>__{The crowd cheers. Harry York gives Kaminski the thumbs-up sign as a banner unfurls: "Today Seattle -- Tomorrow the World."}
<TRANS>__{FADE TO BLACK: FADE IN:}
<ACTION>__{A TITLE COMES ON SCREEN: GOD'S IN HIS HEAVEN AND ALL'S RIGHT WITH THE WORLD? 'NOT SO!' SAYS YOUNG FRANCES FARMER We realize we've been watching a newsreel. We SEE the SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT presenting Frances with an award.}
<CHAR>__{ANNOUNCER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Seattle is in the news again as a high school junior wins a national competition and a hundred dollar prize with an essay denying God.}
<ACTION>__{City Hall steps. Judge Hillier and other BIGWIGS speaking heatedly to reporters.}
<CHAR>__{ANNOUNCER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This prompts civic officials to charge that left-wing politicians are encouraging atheism in the city's schools. Miss Frances Farmer was unavailable for comment, but her mother Lillian --}
<ACTION>__{Lillian stands in front of her wood frame house addressing a small CROWD of reporters, photographers, and curious neighbors.}
<CHAR>__{ANNOUNCER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Farmer, a well-known local dietician, stepped to her daughter's defense.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(emphatically)}
<DIAL>__{Frances has not turned her back on the Lord, they're just having a momentary difference of opinion. What child hasn't questioned the Lord's mysteries in order to better understand them? To paraphrase Mr. Voltaire, I may not agree with what she says, but I'll defend to the death her right to say it. Freedom of speech, unlike in the dark countries to the east, still lives in America! And in my home.}
<ACTION>__{Among the AUDIENCE in the cinema, we SEE Frances and her father. Frances slinks down in her seat until she's hidden from sight.}
<LOC>__{EXT. SUBURBAN STREET (SEATTLE) - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Frances carries library books and a small grocery bag. Her hair and skin gleam in the sun. People in their yards stare at her as she passes. She walks on, coming to a group of CHILDREN slightly younger than herself who are playing in front of a union hall. A girl, EMMA, 13, glances up.}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hi Emma.}
<ACTION>__{Emma looks away quickly, returns to her play.}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Bye Emma.}
<ACTION>__{Frances shakes her head as she walks on.}
<CHAR>__{MAN'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey!}
<ACTION>__{Frances hesitates, then turns to look: A man in his twenties whom we recognize as Harry York, Kaminski's compatriot, leaves a group of men in front of the union hall and walks toward her.}
<CHAR>__{HARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(friendly)}
<DIAL>__{C'mere. I wanna talk to you.}
<ACTION>__{Frances keeps walking. Harry hurries after her.}
<CHAR>__{HARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(reaches her, grabs her arm)}
<DIAL>__{Hey!}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't touch me.}
<CHAR>__{HARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.}

<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(waiting)}
<DIAL>__{Okay then...}
<CHAR>__{HARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?}
<CHAR>__{HARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not me. But other people seem to.}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.}
<CHAR>__{HARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(examining him)}
<DIAL>__{No... Actually, you look more like a cop.}
<ACTION>__{Harry laughs.}
<CHAR>__{HARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's rich. Hey, if I was a cop, I'd be packing, right?}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(holding coat open)}
<DIAL>__{You see a gun? Go on, search me. Pat me down.}
<ACTION>__{Frances hesitates, leans toward him as though about to frisk him. Their eyes meet, and she pulls away, suddenly embarrassed.}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?}
<CHAR>__{HARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(smiles & points to him)}
<DIAL>__{Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!}
<CHAR>__{HARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(embarrassed)}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, well --}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...}
<CHAR>__{HARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Whattaya mean?}
<CHAR>__{HARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But I'm not. The newspapers're --}
<CHAR>__{HARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah. Could look bad for you and Kaminski too, I guess.}
<ACTION>__{Beat.}
<CHAR>__{HARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.}
<CHAR>__{HARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.}
<CHAR>__{HARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Harry.}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(hesitates, nods)}
<DIAL>__{Harry.}
<ACTION>__{They half-smile, awkwardly, as if neither really wants this encounter to end. Then Harry doffs his hat.}
<CHAR>__{HARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Bye.}
<ACTION>__{She nods shyly and starts up the path toward the house.}
<CHAR>__{HARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(admiring her)}
<DIAL>__{Sure don't walk like sixteen, neither.}
<LOC>__{INT. COURTROOM - LATE AFTERNOON}
<ACTION>__{CLOSE ON Judge Hillier in his robes, identified by a nameplate on the bench.}
<CHAR>__{HILLIER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{These are perilous times. With the economic collapse comes hopelessness and desperation; and people turn to dangerous ideas --}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I know.}
<ACTION>__{The CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK. We SEE that the courtroom is empty.}
<CHAR>__{HILLIER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Those of us who represent law and order must be vigilant. Who's behind this, her mother?}
<ACTION>__{Now we SEE who he's talking to: Alma Styles, the woman who sat with Lillian at the school auditorium.}
<CHAR>__{STYLES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Impossible. As her attorney, I've known her for years.}
<CHAR>__{HILLIER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What about the father, he's a little pink. Maybe he wants to show our schools in a bad light, shift some support to Kaminski and those jackals.}
<CHAR>__{STYLES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(shaking her head)}
<DIAL>__{He's no influence; he doesn't even live at home. No, I think Frances wrote that essay with no mischief intended. It was her teacher who entered it in the competition.}
<CHAR>__{HILLIER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, the publicity must stop. It's no good for Seattle and no good for the country.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(sternly)}
<DIAL>__{Keep an eye on this, will you, Alma?}
<CHAR>__{STYLES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Of course, your honor.}
<ACTION>__{He nods with satisfaction. Two right-thinking people fighting for what they believe in.}
<LOC>__{INT. FARMER HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Ernest Farmer sits alone, motionless, at the table. Between two candles, facing him, is Frances' check for a hundred dollars. We HEAR bustle from behind the kitchen door, then Lillian and Frances enter juggling several hot dishes. Ernest rises. They set down the dishes, Frances intentionally placing the bread between the check and her father.}
<CHAR>__{ERNEST} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(pushing back her plate)}
<DIAL>__{I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.}
<ACTION>__{She leaves. A long silence. They both glance slightly awkwardly at the check. Frances takes it, folds it, and puts it in her pocket, out of sight.}
<CHAR>__{ERNEST} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thanks, Dad.}
<CHAR>__{ERNEST} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I didn't have much to do with it.}
<CHAR>__{ERNEST} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You wrote it, didn't you?}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?}
<CHAR>__{ERNEST} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.}
<CHAR>__{ERNEST} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Is Kaminski a Communist?}
<CHAR>__{ERNEST} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.}

<DIAL>__{He's a socialist, then?}
<LOC>__{INT. STUDY - LILLIAN - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Sitting at a rolltop desk. She's looking through a large scrapbook. We SEE articles about nutrition and diet, some featuring Lillian's picture, others with her name in the heading. She listens to the conversation in the other room.}
<CHAR>__{ERNEST } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{The label's not important, Francie. What's important is: this country's got nine million unemployed and something's gotta be done about it. Besides: left-wing, right-wing, up- wing, down-wing... they don't mean much. All a label is usually is a way to call somebody a dirty name.}
<ACTION>__{Lillian's face becomes set. She looks down at the book. An article titled "Girl Denies God" is there, freshly pasted. She lays a hand on the blank page opposite.}

<ACTION>__{Lillian appears in the doorway.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?}
<CHAR>__{FRANCES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes, Ma.}

<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{ERNEST} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

Their faces are slack, only their eyes glow with an animal ferocity. Some wander aimlessly about, unheeding of others who are pushing, kicking and screaming at them. Many squat in the dirt by the walls, mired in their own urine and excrement, chanting wordlessly to themselves. Some appear lifeless, their prone bodies shoved out of the way. Some women are involved in violent sex with themselves or each other, some in mindless fist-fights. In a far corner we SEE a group of men in various military and medical uniforms, their backs to us, facing the wall, grouped around something. We HEAR their cheering and laughing and joking, slapping each other on the back. We SLOWLY MOVE CLOSER and can see over their shoulders the object of their hilarity. It's Frances, lying naked and spread- eagled on the floor. Four hospital ATTENDANTS pin her arms and legs. A SOLDIER, his pants down around his ankles, is squirming violently on top of her.
