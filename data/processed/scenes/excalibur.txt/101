<L>__{exterior jousting ground day}
<A>__{the sun has risen shining cruelly into guenevere's eyes; the queen is alone at the stake. sir gawain rides up to king arthur, who waits alone, separated from the others.}
<C>__{sir gawain}
<D>__{my lord, the sun is upon the field. the queen has no champion. i demand justice, as is my right.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{so it is.}
<A>__{perceval leaps onto his horse.}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{let me champion the queen!}
<A>__{sir gawain looks at the squire with contempt.}
<C>__{sir gawain}
<P>__{(to arthur)}
<D>__{since no knight comes forward, i demand justice }
<A>__{arthur is in anguish. he searches the tree line for a sign of lancelot. he looks from guenevere at the stake to his own knights watching him. he draws excalibur. a gasp goes through the crowd of onlookers.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{boy, kneel.}
<A>__{perceval leaps from his horse and bends his knee before the king. arthur brings the sword down on the boy's shoulder, giving him the three strokes.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{in the name of god, of st. michael, and st. george, i make you a knight. rise, sir...}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{...perceval!}
<A>__{gawain shakes his head disdainfully as perceval mounts back into the saddle, his eyes burning with fervor. sir gawain and perceval ride to opposite ends of the field. the spectators fall silent, all staring blankly, their senses dulled by the tragedy, at the uneven combatants. a cry goes up. lancelot rides out of the forest. he rides up to the king and salutes him. arthur smiles at his old friend, tears of joy in his eyes. lancelot bows toward guenevere and rides on to where perceval waits. lancelot reaches out to touch perceval's cheek.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{it's my task to prove the queen's innocence.}
<A>__{perceval cannot reply, his eyes affixed on the blood that trickles from lancelot's hauberk. lancelot raises his lance in salute to gawain across the field. gawain salutes in answer. the two huge knights charge at each other, each man's spear tip making contact with the other's armor, and in the violent collision both are unhorsed. lancelot is slower at getting to his feet and drawing his sword. he is bleeding below the hauberk from his self inflicted wound. in the first onslaught lancelot fights defensively, falling back. he has to toss aside his shield and hold his stomach with his shield hand. morgana watches with merlin. every terrible blow of sword on sword reverberates through her body pleasurable. merlin is captivated by her cruel sensuality.}
