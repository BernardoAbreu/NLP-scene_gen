<L>__{interior chimera engine room continuous night}
<A>__{where the propeller shaft extends into a large turbine. she continues on, past huge rusting diesel burners, disappearing into the darkness above her, when another boom sounds. she turns, shinning her light back from where she came. nothing moves. not a sound, but for her breathing and maybe her heart pounding in her chest. another boom sounds, again echoing distantly in the silence. she shines her light through the line of burners. nothing moves. epps moves quietly between the burners. she comes to a massive watertight door at the bulkhead. she steps through, finding herself standing between a row of huge oil storage tanks. the booming sounds again, closer, as suddenly stopping. she moves on, cautiously walking between the tanks, holding her light out before her. she comes to the end of the compartment and another bulkhead. the booming sounds, still closer. she turns the light into the recesses, showing rusting machinery and a stack of oil drums. she approaches, holding the shotgun up. as she nears, the booming sounds again. she stops. it is coming from here. she tenses, raising the shotgun, holding the light as steady as she can manage. the booming sounds yet again. it is metallic and staccato. she stops in the corner beside an oil drum. several drums have toppled and lie scattered in a pile when a draft stirs her hair. she shines her light up to see that she stands at the bottom of a giant hatchway shaft rising all the way through the ship to the top deck and an echoey breeze that betrays a throughway to the outside. the booming sounds again, this time coming from the pile of oil drums. she steps closer, raising the shotgun, ready to fire. a beat as she summons her courage, then reaches out to push a drum with her foot, when a blur explodes out at her. she fires the shotgun and a spray of buckshot glances off the steel bulkhead in a shower of sparks, a flurry of frenetic flapping whizzing by her head as she looks up to see a large albatross flying back up the hatchway shaft toward the top of the ship and freedom.}

<A>__{she wipes her brow on her sleeve, holding there a moment, when she smells something really awful. she steps forward, following the smell, pushing aside the toppled oil drums to see an unidentifiable form in the beam of her flashlight. she steps still closer, training her light on the form to see that it is a human torso. a large gash runs up its middle and the clothing has been torn by scavenging birds. she hesitates, then steps still closer when she steps on something. she starts, then shines the light on the deck in front of her where the body's decaying head looks back with wide, unseeing eyes. it takes everything she has just to hold there. she shines her light back to the headless torso. she shines her light beyond that, and up, to reveal a bent steam pipe hanging out over the deck, stained with dried blood, a pair of legs dangling from the pipe when, just behind her, a booted foot comes into frame, lightly touching her. she spins around to see another body above her. except this one hangs in one piece, suspended from another bent steam pipe. it has been impaled length wise on the pipe from rectum to mouth. one of its arms has rotted off and lies on the deck below it. a few feet away, a third body hangs impaled from another bent pipe.}
