<L>__{interior hotel islay smiley's room night}
<A>__{the music a charlie rich track plays on a transistor radio. smiley sits at the window listening to the music. guillam dictates from a photograph of the documents he took at the circus. smiley becomes aware that the others are watching him. he turns away, tunes the radio into a different station, cutting the charlie rich tune.}

<D>__{jerry westerby, dismissed december 4th. and... connie sachs, retired november 28th. that's just two weeks after you and control were forced out.}
<A>__{smiley considers this, turns back to the chess set. he writes connie's name on a slip of paper, pastes it to a chess piece. there is a knock at the door. mendel lets lacon into the room excluding a very excited mrs. pope graham. lacon's wearing a tux, looking extremely uncomfortable, almost offended at the role he finds himself playing.}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{i know that car.}
<C>__{lacon}
<D>__{on our way to la boheme. the minister wondered if there was anything to report?}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{not much, i'm afraid. we were just discussing the departure of connie sachs. i wonder how research manages without her.}
<C>__{peter guillam}
<D>__{probably relieved. she always struck me as unhinged.}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{that was one of her talents.}
<A>__{lacon looks around him, dripping disdain.}
<C>__{lacon}
<P>__{(indicating the chess set)}
<D>__{looking a little unhinged yourself, george.}
<C>__{smiley}
<P>__{(distracted)}
<D>__{hmm?}
<A>__{he turns to him.}
<C>__{smiley }
<D>__{yes, i suppose i am. perhaps that's what we have to become? a little paranoid?}
<A>__{he turns back to the chess board.}
<C>__{smiley }
<P>__{(to lacon)}
<D>__{your "clean sweep." what if the mole was actually behind that sweep? what if each of us, whether we knew it or not, represented a threat to the mole?}
<A>__{lacon looks at a pile of files, distractedly picks one up. he starts to leaf through one...}
<C>__{lacon}
<P>__{(unconvinced)}
<D>__{control lost his position because of that fiasco in budapest... that poor chap...?}
<A>__{he looks to guillam for the name.}
<C>__{peter guillam}
<D>__{jim prideaux.}
<A>__{smiley nods thoughtfully.}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{yes. yes, he did.}
<A>__{he writes prideaux on a slip of paper, pastes it to a chess piece. lacon picks up another file, something catches his eye: a letter head of flames. he looks up shocked.}
<C>__{lacon}
<D>__{how did you get this? this is witchcraft material.}
<A>__{he grabs the piece of paper, stuffing it in his pocket. smiley looks at him. lacon reads something implacable in smiley's gaze... smiley turns back to the chess set.}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{control was out. and alleline was in. thanks to...}
<A>__{he writes the name "witchcraft" and places it on a chess piece.}
