<L>__{interior safehouse living room. evening.}
<A>__{it's raining heavily outside and water is dripping through the cracks in the ceiling. david kneels next to vogel with a bowl of oatmeal and strips the tape from his mouth.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{thank you. david.}
<A>__{david doesn't react. vogel hums a tune to himself in between spoonfuls, watching david, his mood strange.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{david and stephan and rachel...}
<A>__{he gives a soft laugh, finding something amusing in the sound of the names.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{if i had a choice i'd prefer rachel to feed me. so gentle...in another life, the makings of a nurse, i think...in another life...}
<A>__{david continues to feed, careful to appear immune to vogel.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{how is she today?}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{you should let her get more rest. it's a dangerous time, the first month or two of the pregnancy.}
<A>__{david stares at him, unable to hide his shock.}
<C>__{vogel }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you didn't know?}
<A>__{vogel absorbs this thoughtfully.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{you're not the father then?}
<P>__{(beat)i thought it would be you.}
<D>__{i thought...i don't know. the way you look at her. the way she looks at you...}
<A>__{david stirs the oatmeal, trying to think about what he's just discovered. vogel doesn't take his eyes off him...}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{women can be like that, they like to make you dance first, i}
<P>__{remember. (as though to himself)}
<D>__{so, she chose the other one...?}
<A>__{he shakes his head, shrugs.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{that must be hard, watching them together, right in front of you. and you not saying a word. like the poet says "great souls suffer in silence." i wouldn't have taken stephan as a family man. too ambitious, too...? whereas you? david, i see you with children...}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{shut up.}
<A>__{vogel stares at him. this is the first time someone has spoken to him in weeks. he's quick to hide his sense of triumph.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{i am expressing my sympathy. for your suffering.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what does a monster like you know about suffering?}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{i'm a doctor, david.}
<A>__{david stares at him.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{a doctor. (beat)you blind children trying to change the colour of their eyes. you inject people with petrol. you...you replace people's hands and legs and you watch as they...}
<A>__{he stops himself.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{this isn't medicine. this is disease. this is sickness.}
<A>__{vogel seems to consider this.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{so we were all insane? is that the answer?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there's no answer. i'm not looking for an answer. i'm not looking for...}
<A>__{he forces himself to be silent, tries to regain control of himself. he offers vogel another spoonful, but his hand trembles a little with the violence of his emotions.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{you're trembling.}
<A>__{david pushes the spoon into vogel's mouth, starts to load another spoonful.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{it's strange. here i am the victim, kidnapped, bound, soon to be murdered, but i think you are the one that is afraid, david.}
<P>__{(beat) afraid of the monster.}
<A>__{he leans closer to david.}
<C>__{vogel }
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{boo.}
<A>__{they stare at each other, eye to eye. vogel senses a new brittleness in david. his tone becomes more assured.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{yes. do you know why it was easy to exterminate you people? your weakness. i saw it. every day i saw it. every one of them, thinking only of how to avoid being flogged, or kicked, or killed. only thinking of themselves.}
<A>__{david looks up at him with a strange, crooked smile, eyes glittering.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{why do you think it only took four soldiers to lead a thousand people to the gas chambers? entire families? because not one, out of thousands, had the courage to resist, the courage to be the first to fall. not one would sacrifice himself. even when we took their children from them. i knew then that you people had no right to live, no right to...}
<A>__{he may have begun his speech hoping to get a reaction from david but he has lost himself in his rant and so rather than triumph we see only a moment of startled fear in his eyes as david suddenly swings the bowl violently at his head, shattering it on the pipe to which he is tied. he grabs vogel by the collar and begins to punch him, hard, again and again. vogel slides sideways, limp. and still david punches him in a murderous rage, possessed, wanting to break his skull open, to kill him. rachel and stephan run in, with rachel reaching him first. she throws her arms around him, trying to stop him, but instinctively he throws a punch behind him. it connects, splitting her lip and sending her flying to the ground. stephan runs at him, knocking him to the floor, and remains lying on him, the two of them breathing hard, the assault finally over. vogel slumps forward, held up only by the rope at his wrists binding him to the pipe on the wall. stephan is still struggling with david, who's panting, adrenalised, staring wildly at vogel's slumped body.}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{out. we're going out.}
<A>__{he begins to drag him out. stephan nods in the direction of}
<B>__{vogel.}
<C>__{stephan }
<P>__{(to rachel)}
<D>__{are you going to be alright?}
<A>__{rachel nods. as she hears the door close, she turns to stare at vogel. he's barely conscious, his face smeared with blood.}
