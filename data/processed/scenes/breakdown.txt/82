<L>__{exterior route 7 day}
<A>__{the road ascends into the rocky hills above the desert plain. the route is narrow and windy, forcing jeff to reduce his speed.}
<L>__{interior cherokee day}
<A>__{jeff drives, desperately searching for any sign of a truck. there are no other vehicles on the road. he keeps pressing the "redial" button. the "no service" indicator beeps over and over.}
<L>__{exterior mountains day}
<A>__{the road curves through a tunnel, then climbs higher, past sharp cliffs and drop offs. jeff follows the signs for "route 7."}
<L>__{interior cherokee day}
<A>__{something catches jeff's eye on the cell phone. for the first time, the "service" indicator blinks green. jeff immediately grabs the phone again and presses "redial." there is a burst of static, then we hear a scratchy ringing. the call is going through.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(thank god)}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{he waits for an answer.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{hello, steve? it's jeff taylor... listen, i don't put me on hold! i need a favor... i've gotta talk to that friend of yours at the f.b.i... no, it's about amy, she's missing }
<A>__{there is a burst of static. the reception is very poor.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i said amy's been }
<A>__{more static.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{fuck!}
<A>__{jeff holds the phone tight to his ear.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{yes, i'm still here. no don't call back steve?! steve?!}
<A>__{the signal cuts off. jeff slams the phone against the dash, furious.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{goddammit!}
<A>__{he punches redial, gets the "no service" beeping, then glances up, sees a }
<B>__{chainlink fence}
<A>__{covered with high visibility markers stretched across the road. the sign: "road closed."}
<B>__{back to jeff}
<A>__{he mashes the brakes. the cherokee skids to a halt just short of the fence. jeff stares at it.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{he grinds his teeth. beyond the padlocked gate, the highway continues as an unpaved dirt road. he deliberates, then throws the cherokee in reverse and does a three point turn so he's facing back in the opposite direction. he looks up, sees }
<B>__{dodge ram pickup truck}
<A>__{has been hiding in the bushes off the road. it lurches forward and stops in the middle of the road, blocking jeff's escape. jeff's eyes widen in fear as he recognizes the vehicle and its driver: earl. earl gets out of the cab with a hunting rifle. he raises it to his shoulder.}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{out of the car! put your hands where i can see 'em!}
<B>__{jeff}
<A>__{swears, panicking.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{i said get out, dammit! now!}
<A>__{jeff stares into the rifle, deliberating. his hand moves to the gearshift. he jerks it into reverse and floors the gas!}
<B>__{cherokee}
<A>__{peels out in reverse, snaking wildly side to side, aiming for the chainlink fence. it bursts the fence! poles and chain mesh go flying!}
<B>__{jeff}
<A>__{cranks the wheel and brakes hard. the rear end of the cherokee swings wide to the edge of the road. he throws the shift into drive and punches the throttle.}
<B>__{earl}
<A>__{jumps in the ram and takes off in pursuit.}
<B>__{jeff}
<A>__{guns the engine. the cherokee bounces wildly on the rutted, storm damaged road. he yanks the four wheel drive lever.}
<B>__{dirt road}
<A>__{the huge pickup streaks after the cherokee, its 7.5 liter v10 roaring, oversized tires devouring the terrain.}
<B>__{jeff}
<A>__{guns the engine on the washboard road surface, the vibration nearly shaking the suspension apart while }
<B>__{ram}
<A>__{keeps pace in the dust from its wake. inside the cab, earl can be seen speaking on a cb transmitter.}
<B>__{jeff}
<A>__{throws the cherokee into a sharp turn in the road. as the car rounds the bend, he looks up, reacting, as }
<B>__{idled bulldozer}
<A>__{blocks the road at a construction site. more unattended earthmoving equipment fills the road beyond.}
<B>__{jeff}
<A>__{brakes wildly. to his right, a cliff goes straight up; on the left, a guardrail protects a steep ravine. he cuts the wheel left, crashes through the guardrail and plunges into the ravine!}
<B>__{cherokee}
<A>__{bounces wildly as it hurtles down the slope, crashing through sagebrush and manzanita.}
<B>__{jeff}
<A>__{clings to the wheel, tossed about violently, as suitcases and packing boxes go everywhere. the cherokee hits a bump on the steep slope and crashes through the upper branches of a willow grove. as the leaves part, we see... a river.}
<B>__{cherokee}
<A>__{lands on the passenger side with a splash and comes to rest half submerged in the rushing water.}
<B>__{earl}
<A>__{jerks the ram to a halt, leaps out and runs to the edge of the road to look down on the cherokee in the river.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{sonofabitch...}
<A>__{he grabs the rifle and begins making his way down the slope.}
<B>__{inside cherokee}
<A>__{the world is sideways. water rushes into the car. jeff is strapped into the driver's seat by the seatbelt. the airbag deflates with a hiss. jeff grimaces in pain. he looks around, blinking. the river is flowing right through the cherokee! luggage, styrofoam hamburger clamshells and empty coke cans bob on the surface of the water. jeff fumbles with the seatbelt release. the belt comes free and he drops suddenly into the water on the passenger side. he gets to his feet, reaches overhead to unlatch the driver's side door and pushes it open. he hoists himself through the door.}
<B>__{riverbank}
<A>__{earl sees jeff emerging from the half submerged cherokee, levels the rifle and fires!}
<B>__{jeff}
<A>__{ducks back inside the cherokee, freaking. the passenger side is on the river bottom and if he tries to get out through the driver's side, he's a sitting duck! jeff swears and looks around, seeing a metal camera case underwater in the back seat. he grabs the case and swings it at the windshield. the first three blows bounce off harmlessly. then the windshield shatters with a crash! he takes a deep breath, submerges and swims underwater through the broken windshield.}
<B>__{on bank}
<A>__{earl stiffens as he sees movement in the water. several items of debris from the car are floating on the current.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{fuck!}
<A>__{he begins moving downstream along the bank, eyeing the river.}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{jeff breaststrokes for all he's worth. sand swirls in the swift current. he pushes away from a boulder in his path. he swims until his lungs are bursting, then surfaces for air.}
<B>__{on bank}
<A>__{earl sees jeff break the surface. he aims the rifle and fires! a bullet smacks the water near jeff's head. then jeff is under again.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{goddammit...}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{jeff struggles to stay in control. the current is turning swifter. his shoulder glances painfully off a boulder.}
<B>__{on bank}
<A>__{earl works his way through the brush at the river's edge. his foot lands between two rocks. he pulls it out, swearing.}
<B>__{behind rock}
<A>__{jeff surfaces and gulps in air, staying out of sight of earl on the bank. then he is down again.}
<B>__{on bank}
<A>__{earl works his way along the shore. up ahead, the river runs over rapids before passing around a bend. earl hears an engine and turns. a huge moving van has arrived on the dirt road overlooking the ravine. he shouts to the driver, pointing downriver.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{he's getting away!}
<A>__{the driver shouts something inaudible. earl runs along the bank, ducking under low hanging branches.}
<B>__{in rapids}
<A>__{jeff is carried over the rocks by the fast moving current. he slams into a boulder, letting out a cry and swallowing a mouthful of water. a downed tree hangs over the river. jeff grabs desperately and takes hold of a branch. he's got it! hanging on to the branch, he notices a familiar object floating past in the water: the "90,000 donuts" pack. jeff tries to haul himself from the river. the branch bends under his weight. then it comes free with a crack! jeff is carried downstream on the rushing water.}
<B>__{on bank}
<A>__{earl works his way along the shore. the unseen driver of the van shouts to him from upriver.}
<C>__{driver of van }
<D>__{where is he?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{he's in the water! i just saw him!}
<B>__{below rapids}
<A>__{the river has turned slow again. jeff fights to his feet in the shallows and staggers to the bank. he drops to his knees, retching. clutching his ribs, he raises his head and looks upriver. for the moment, there is no sign of earl. but he could appear anytime. jeff gets to his feet, wincing. he looks up at the rocky canyon wall bordering the river. it's steep but scalable. he begins climbing.}
