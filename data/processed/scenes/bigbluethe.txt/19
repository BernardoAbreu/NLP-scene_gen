<L>__{exterior harbor construction site day}
<A>__{a beat up fiat, towing an equally beat up trailer, stops. enzo unfolds out of the driver's seat, like a circus clown emerging from a toy car. the construction supervisor, an american, wearing a three piece suit, hurries over to him. enzo has already started undressing. roberto unloads the diving gear from the trailer.}
<C>__{supervisor}
<P>__{(exhausted)}
<D>__{signore molinari?}
<C>__{roberto}
<P>__{(shaking his hand)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(calmly undressing, expressionless)}
<D>__{how did it happen?}
<C>__{supervisor}
<P>__{(upset)}
<D>__{the company asked me to extract everything i could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, i fucked up! can you help?}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{how many are, down there?}
<A>__{enzo goes back to the car.}
<C>__{supervisor}
<D>__{just one... we're feeding him air, but he's not breathing regularly... you've got to get him out fast.}
<A>__{enzo glances at the map, then at the accident site.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{ten thousand.}
<C>__{supervisor}
<D>__{lira?}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{dollars.}
<C>__{supervisor}
<D>__{you're going to hold me up at a time like this?}
<C>__{roberto}
<D>__{you do understand you're talking to the champion diver of the world?}
<C>__{supervisor}
<D>__{yes, but ten thousand dollars...}
<A>__{enzo opens the trunk of his fiat and pulls out the jack. he slams the trunk shut, and stands looking at the american, straight in the eyes.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{okay. you tell me. how much would you say the man's life is worth?}
<A>__{extremely uncomfortable, the supervisor doesn't answer.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{in my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.}
<C>__{supervisor}
<P>__{(baffled)}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{roberto}
<D>__{that you should get your checkbook. damn quick.}
