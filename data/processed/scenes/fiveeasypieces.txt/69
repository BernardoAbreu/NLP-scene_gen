<L>__{interior roadside cafe day}
<A>__{all four are seated at a booth. the women have given their orders and a waitress stands above bobby, waiting for his:}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(looking at his menu)}
<D>__{i will have an omelette, no potatoes. give me tomatoes instead, and wheat toast instead of rolls.}
<A>__{the waitress indicates something on the menu with the butt of her pencil.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{no substitutions.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what does that mean? you don't have any tomatoes?}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{no. we have tomatoes.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{but i can't have any. is that what you mean?}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{only what's on the menu...}
<P>__{(again, indicating with her pencil)}
<D>__{a number two: plain omelette. it comes with cottage fries and rolls.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i know what it comes with, but that's not what i want.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{i will come back when you've made up your mind...}
<A>__{she starts to move away and bobby detains her.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{wait, i've made up my mind. i want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{i'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. i can give you an english muffin or a coffee roll.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? you make sandwiches, don't you?}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{would you like to talk to the manager?}
<C>__{palm}
<D>__{hey, mack!}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(to palm)}
<D>__{shut up.}
<P>__{(to the waitress)}
<D>__{you have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{i don't make the rules.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{okay, i will make it as easy for you as i can. give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce and a cup of coffee.}
<A>__{she begins writing down his order, repeating it sarcastically:}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{one number two, and a chicken sal san hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce and a cup of coffee... anything else?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(challenging him)}
<D>__{you want me to hold the chicken.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yeah. i want you to hold it between your knees.}
<A>__{the other three laugh, and the waitress points to a "right to refuse" sign above the counter.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{you see that sign, sir?!}
<A>__{bobby glances over at it, then back to her.}
<C>__{waitress }
<D>__{you'll all have to leave, i'm not taking any more of your smartness and your sarcasm!}
<A>__{he smiles politely at her, then:}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you see this sign?}
<A>__{he reaches his arm out and "clears" the table for her.}
