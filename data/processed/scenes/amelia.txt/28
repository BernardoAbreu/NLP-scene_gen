<A>__{it's dark and cold. bill and amelia stand at the dock beside their plane. he's drinking coffee as they watch slim come down the quay with a slip of paper in his hand. amelia steps forward to take it. reads with neutral eyes.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{good. slim, start the engines.}
<A>__{she still hasn't given the paper to bill. slim steps onto a pontoon. starts cranking up the propellers. as the engine kicks to life... she hands the weather report to bill. he reads. looks to her eyes.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{you signed a contract. you've got a direct instruction from me to go. that report indicates some degree of risk and it's a risk i'm taking.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{have a nice flight.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{she motions to slim, get on board. the navigator grins, starts to climb up, looking back at bill...}
<C>__{slim}
<D>__{hey, i'm scared shitless of this dame.}
<A>__{she climbs up after him. one look back...}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{read tomorrow's papers, bill. we'll both be in them.}
<A>__{and disappears. alone on the dock, bill hears the engines rev. jesus, god, she's going to do it. he takes a step toward the plane, but her head appears in the hatch...}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{so, to take off, you pull back on the thing, right?}
<A>__{her perfectly straight, innocent face. he busts out laughing. this fucking girl. tosses his coffee. climbs aboard.}
