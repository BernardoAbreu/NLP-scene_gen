<L>__{interior estate cottage, balmoral day}
<A>__{john brown is standing in the doorway of a small cottage watching, with amused detachment, as a middle aged couple, mr and mrs grant, race about their tiny living room, trying desperately to make it presentable for the queen's sudden visit. they fling open the windows, slosh water on the fire, tidy up their two grubby boys, plump up the cushions, dump knitting under the sofa and try to smarten themselves up, all in the space of a few seconds.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{there's really no need for this.}
<C>__{mrs grant}
<D>__{i will not have her seeing it like it is!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i know she means well, but i wish she'd warn us she was coming.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{she thinks if she warned you, you'd go pouring water on the fire and stuffing the knitting under the sofa.}
<C>__{mr grant}
<D>__{aye, well, you can't stop a wife being house proud.}
<A>__{mrs grant surveys the room critically.}
<C>__{mrs grant}
<D>__{all right.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{show her in.}
