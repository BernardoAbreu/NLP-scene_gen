<L>__{exterior dead tree finds honey}
<A>__{it had not been a good day, though as moonwatcher had no real remembrance of the past he could not compare one day with another. but on the way back to the caves he finds a hive of bees in the stump of a dead tree, and so enjoys the finest delicacy his people could ever know. of course, he also collects a good many stings, but he scacely notices them. he is now as near to contentment as he is ever likely to be; for thought he is still hungry, he is not actually weak with hunger. that was the most that any hominid could hope for.}
