<A>__{sam is by himself, his eyes closed, listening to music through headphones as alyssa stops to stare; she visually scans him head to foot, appearing slightly perplexed as a friend passes.}

<D>__{i wouldn't make a habit of it.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{the friend walks on; after a beat, alyssa does too.}
<L>__{exterior top of the world park evening}
<A>__{in the distance, the sun colors the sky a blinding orange as it sets. a range rover with blackened windows is parked behind a porsche. 'tinted windows,' an up tempo tune with a hand clapping by the pansy division, begins: 'a bed would be a treat but all we've got is this backseat tinted windows are a beautiful thing.' through the front windshield, we can see marek sitting in the passenger's seat with his eyes closed.}
<B>__{another view}
<A>__{josh, marek's friend, is sitting on a bench in the park behind the cars. 'a dark secluded spot in a deserted parking lot tinted windows are a wonderful thing.' suddenly, the passenger door on the rover opens and marek climbs out, brushing his hair with his hands before casually checking his zipper. he closes the door and the car speeds away. josh walks to marek and wordlessly they climb into the porsche and drive off.}
