<B>__{todd.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{...and it got worse and worse. my father hadn't had any work in three months and...also...there were other things...violence... political feelings. my father said he'd heard it was better in the trinity moons. a lot of other people must have had the same idea because the ship was jammed with people...mostly families. that's probably why it broke down... overloaded.}
<A>__{across the room, todd, wearing a t shirt and baggy pants is sitting on a stool, his face impassive as ever. as sandra talks, her back to him, todd's eyes are on the contours of her body against the shift she's wearing. it's very...erotic.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{even after they made the repairs, it barely got off the ground, it was an old converted mining transport, a piece of junk to start with. it just...dropped. maybe you saw what's left of it...out there in the wind. a lot of people died. and we couldn't make any radio contact... so we were stuck here. nobody was happy about it. a few years later, when the dumpers started coming over and dropping stuff, people tried to get their attention with explosions and fires. but it didn't work. they must be unmanned...or they just don't care. maybe they think we're garbage too!}
<A>__{todd's face is as impassive as ever while his eyes caress the shape of her body...and she, unaware, continues to reminisce.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{so there really wasn't any choice. people had to pull together and make the best of it. we became a... community.}
<A>__{as sandra maneuvers nathan, todd catches glimpses of her breasts pushing against the material of the shift. she continues, still not noticing where his attention is.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{one good thing...nobody bothers us. who'd want to fight over a godforsaken place like this?}
<A>__{a wry laugh. she turns to put nathan down on the floor and catches todd's eyes just as he shifts them quickly from her breasts. for a moment it's awkward...she looks at him...then she recovers.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{i guess that's what you like! the fighting, i mean. the wars.}
<P>__{(unsure, a question really)}
<D>__{you must...you're a soldier...}
<A>__{todd doesn't answer as we...}
