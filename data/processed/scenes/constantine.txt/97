<A>__{a lone tree stands in the center of the lit courtyard. john and angela approach it. examine it. nothing. john drops lower on the tree, to a child's height. finally sees something near the ground, gestures to angela. she kneels down next to him, sees what he sees. that same symbol. the one hennessey carved into his hand. but this time there's more.}

<P>__{(trying to rationalize)}
<D>__{there must have been a tree in our backyard... when we were kids...}
<A>__{john may not be buying it but he's not saying anything. his fingers trace these words carved below the symbol }
