<L>__{exterior farmhouse night}
<A>__{an old gothic farmhouse stands atop a hill at the end of a long sloping dirt road. scarecrows with pumpkin heads hang crucified on crosses lining the drive. everything is severely overgrown. bill and baby enter the gates of the farm, they walk up the main drive. baby runs forward and begins jumping around in the huge mud puddles, then runs up onto the front porch of the old house. the front of the house is covered with strange junk art. hundreds of dolls faces are nailed to the walls.}
<C>__{baby}
<D>__{these are all my dolls. i use to like to chop their heads off.}
<A>__{broken bottles and cans are cemented together in weird human figures, animal skins stretched over bone armatures form a makeshift roof. glowing down from the upper windows are grinning jack o' }
<B>__{lanterns.}
<C>__{baby}
<D>__{the door's locked. i will gotta go around... wait here.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{baby runs off around the side of the house. bill stands looking off into the distance at the desolate farm grounds. the rain continues to hammer down. from bill's pov we see a silhouette of a lone figure walking in the distance. the shape of a large dog follows behind him. bill jumps, startled by the sound of the heavy front door opening.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{christ, you scared the shit out of me.}
<C>__{baby}
<D>__{aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{is your brother ready to go?}
<C>__{baby}
<D>__{oh... yeah, he already left. we'll wait inside, come on.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{he left!}
<C>__{baby}
<D>__{yeah, come on.}
<A>__{baby grabs bill by the arm and pulls him into the house. the heavy iron door slams shut.}
