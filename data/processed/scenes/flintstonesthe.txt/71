<L>__{interior barney's workshop night}
<A>__{fred and barney are surrounded by books and cartons and memorabilia. they have their arms around each other and are singing.}
<D>__{fred & barney 'now it's time to do or die, grab that rock and kick it high, let's fight, fight, fight for bedrock high!'}
<A>__{they break up laughing. fred chuckles, looks at one of the many old photographs strewn around.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{boy, those were the days, barney. bedrock high winning all those games... and you and me right in the middle of it.}
<A>__{new angle favoring photo the photograph (dots in stone) shows the young fred and barney in their cheerleading costumes. barney has a sweater and megaphone; fred is in a godzilla like "mascot" costume. he's holding the hideously sculpted head under his arm.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{yeah. too bad we never made the team.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{so what? we made the team spirit. that's just as important... whatever happened to those cheerleader costumes?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{you know betty. she never throws anything away.}
<A>__{he hauls out an old footlocker, opens it. there they are.}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(rummaging in it)}
<D>__{boy. talk about memories.}
<A>__{fred tosses the cheerleader sweater to barney, who grins, pulls it on. fred also starts to get into his old "uniform," but has to suck his gut in mightily. finally, he can zip it up, stern to stem.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{back then, we thought a pop quiz was a big problem. we didn't know how good we had it. no problems, no worries...}
<A>__{saying this, fred attempts to put on the godzilla like head. he has a hard time sliding it into a hinge rail behind his neck, an even harder time swinging it down and forward.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{speaking of problems and worries, shouldn't we get on over to slate's party?}
<A>__{fred has finally "clinked" the monster head down into place. now, when he talks, the monster's mouth moves in sync.}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(echo y)}
<D>__{what for? so him and all his fancy friends can look down their noses at us?}
<A>__{completely covered in the ferocious looking suit, fred steps over to barney, stabs an angry claw in his direction.}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(echo y)}
<D>__{all they've been doing is using us, barney. and meanwhile }
<A>__{now fred reaches up to take the head off. it sticks for a moment. finally he gets it to flip back on its hinge where it hangs behind his neck like a ski parka hood.}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(normal voice)}
<D>__{ meanwhile all the time they were laughing at us.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{yeah? when did you notice that?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{about an hour ago.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{boy, there's no fooling you, fred.}
<A>__{suddenly, with a growing creaking, cracking and tinkling, a scale model of slate city in the corner begins to fall apart. fred and barney look at each other, startled, then rush over to the model. it's the interim version we saw earlier. closer model the decomposition continues, walls and supports turning into sand and running down before our eyes. in a rube goldberg like continuum, the little houses go first, falling like dominoes...}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{wha... what's happening?}
<A>__{barney tries to stop the process, can't.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{i... i don't know... the fibrerock it's... it's decomposing... but this shouldn't happen...}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{your old models are just fine...}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{indeed, the older models from barney's tinkering days are rock solid.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{it should be. there's enough coo coo berry resin in there to petrify a brontosaurus }
<A>__{suddenly barney gets it. he looks from the older models to the now decomposing little fibresphere with growing awareness.}
<C>__{barney}
<P>__{(snapping his fingers)}
<D>__{ the coo coo berries! fred, that's it!}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{what's it?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{remember i said the fibrefoam tasted funny? it was the coo coo sap that was missing!}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{but.. why would }
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{why? because coo coo berries are as valuable as goldrock! and we've had tons of 'em delivered to the plant since we started... somebody musta got greedy }
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{ not 'somebody' lava!}
<C>__{barney}
<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{fred, that sap acts as a fixative it's the glue that holds the whole formula together !}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(with mounting concern)}
<D>__{then... what's happening here...}
<C>__{barney}
<P>__{(finishing it)}
<D>__{... is gonna happen for real in the real slate city!}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{oh no... barney! wilma and betty and the kids they're all there }
<A>__{with a final whimper, the little fibresphere caves in and then the nearby slate needle crumbles, model story by model story. finally the "disk" on top of the needle is all that's left, wobbling around like a spun dinner plate. it finally falls... explodes.}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{ b barney... what do we do?}
<A>__{barney runs to a locker, grabs a big plunger powered flit gun, begins filling it with a red liquid.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{coo coo berry sap, fred! it's our only chance their only chance!}
<A>__{barney gives it a quick test squirt. fred nods, and they rush out of the room. camera pushes in on the ruins of the model "slate city"...}
