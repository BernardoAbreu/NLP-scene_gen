<A>__{the vantage point only reveals a small aspect of the interior, a square plaza with a garden beneath the sunroof of transparent bubbles. the space is open all the way down to the garden, which is two storeys below. around the garden on the bottom floor can be seen the entrances to several shops. all but one have heavy metal cage gates down and locked into position. one or two zombies are seen wandering about. they cannot enter the stores, except for the one which is un gated. halfway up the walls can be seen a balcony railing which rings the entire plaza, it is a second storey of shops. the same cage gates seal off the visible store entrances, but none of the dead creatures are evident on the balcony.}
