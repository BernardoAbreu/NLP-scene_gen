SUPERIMPOSED TITLES appear and hold for a moment. Abruptly, the image springs to life. The gun FIRES deafeningly. The nearby branches shake violently. Another set of TITLES appears. The image FREEZES again as a lone bugle plays a charge. Again and again and again, the image moves, the gun DISCHARGES noisily, the image FREEZES and more sets of TITLES appear with every FIRING. On the last discharge, the trumpet fades and all hell breaks loose:}

Troops marching across a bridge as a shell hits the river below sending water towering into the sky. An entire cavalry division galloping hard over the battlefield, blazing mortar fire visible above them on the horizon. Brief shots of the horses, their grim riders hanging on for dear life, their muscles flexing, hooves pounding the dirt. Men yelling. FASTER AND FASTER, MORE AND MORE CHAOTIC: Mortar fire, explosions, smoke. A machine gunner fires. A soldier falls. Infantrymen, rifles in hand, press through the haze. More machine gunning. More soldiers go down. A massive gun fires.}

The ground explodes. A bomb drops from an airplane. Aerial view of an exploding building. Anti-aircraft guns at work. Planes in the air. A machine gun fires skyward. Planes circle, filling the air. A single bi-plane. The plane's gunner, SHEP LAMBERT, looks down, surveys the situation, breaks into a grin. Shep nudges his pilot, CARY LOCKWOOD, and points. Cary looks down to see: Another plane below. In it, pilot BILL TALBOT waves and salutes. FRANCIS, the gunner, opens his mouth, smiles and nods up at them. An enemy plane arrives. The enemy pilot fires his twin machine guns. Bill and Francis' plane spins away. Bill cocks a snook at the enemy plane and waves dismissively at it, much to Francis' amusement. The planes circle in the air. The enemy plane trails Shep and Cary. Shep FIRES his machine gun to no avail as Cary watches. The enemy pilot returns fire. The two planes tango in mid-air. Shep FIRES. The enemy pilot grins and FIRES. Bullet holes riddle the side of Shep and Cary's plane. Cary warns Shep they've been hit. From the enemy plane's POV, Shep and Cary's plane streams black smoke. The two planes. Shep and Cary's plane goes into a steep dive, spinning out of control. Cary rips off his goggles as smoke pours up from below him. Flames fill the cockpit as Cary's gloved hands desperately try to keep hold of the red hot controls. The plane, streaming smoke, spins wildly downward. Shep, surrounded with smoke, looks skyward and salutes with mock gallantry. Above, Bill and Francis watch. Bill returns the salute with a smile and waves. Francis, though, doesn't look happy. Shep twists in his seat and looks around. Cary's hands grasp the controls in the flaming cockpit.}
