<L>__{interior police station moments later}
<A>__{einhorn is barking out orders to other cops as she heads for her office.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{emilio, get me the autopsy on podacter! aguado, send out a memo. no one talks to the press…}
<L>__{interior einhorn's office continuous action}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{…and somebody get me a cup of coffee!}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(tv announcer's voice)}
<D>__{tonight on "miami vice", crockett geets the boss coffee!}
<A>__{ace is in her office, popping sunflower seeds, kicking back. einhorn walks to her private bathroom.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{ventura, when i get out of this bathroom, you better be gone.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{is it number one or number two?}
<A>__{einhorn turns and glares at ace.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{i just want to know how much time i have.}
<A>__{einhorn goes to the sink and begins washing her hands.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{oh, by the way, i went ahead and solved that pesky, snowflake podacter marino thing.}
<C>__{einhorn }
<P>__{(humoring him)}
<D>__{oh yeah?}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{yeah, ever hear of a former dolphin kicker named ray finkle?}
<A>__{the water shuts off. einhorn appears around the corner.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{alright, ventura. make it quick.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{i found a rare stone at the bottom of snowflake's tank. it's from a dolphin '82 afc championship ring. it would have been a super bowl ring, but ray finkle missed the big kick. blames the whole thing on marino. we're talking paranoid, delusional psychosis. i saw the guy's room… cozy, if you're hannibal lector.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{so how does roger podacter fit in?}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{my guess is finkle was snooping around. podacter recognized him. end of story. as for snowflake… they gave him finkle's number, and taught him how to kick a field goal. finkle took it personally.}
<A>__{einhorn listens with great interest.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{so where is finkle, now?}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{he broke out of a metal hospital. did a claude raines. he's been planning his revenge for years. waiting for the perfect time to get back at the dolphins. the time when it would hurt them the most. super bowl time! man, i'm tired of being right!}
<A>__{einhorn walks in front and sits on the edge of the desk. she's totally softened her demeanor.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{congratulations. you've done some fine detective work, ace.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{ahh, could you talk in my good ear. i thought i heard you call me ace.}
<A>__{einhorn gets real close.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{maybe i was wrong about you. maybe you are more than just a pet dick.}
<A>__{she suddenly plants a major, tonsil cleaning, open mouthed kiss on ace. objects are knocked off the desk as they lean back.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{your gun's digging into my hip.}
<A>__{more kissing, the ace stops.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<P>__{(still coming on)}
<D>__{what's wrong, ace? want me to read you your rights?}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{maybe later.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{what is it? that bony little bitch, melissa robinson?}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{no. you just don't do anything for me.}
<A>__{he quickly adjusts his crotch, to conceal the erection. einhorn withdraws with a coy smile.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{i will be here if you ever want a real woman.}
<A>__{there's a sharp knock at the door.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{aguado opens the door.}
<C>__{aguado}
<D>__{everything okay in here? heard some commotion.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{fine, sergeant.}
<C>__{aguado}
<D>__{you want me to throw him out?}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{why don't you throw yourself out.}
<C>__{aguado}
<D>__{…yes, ma'am.}
<A>__{a crestfallen aguado exits. ace heads for the door.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{ace, i want you to leave everything to us.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{can't do that, lieutenant. i was hired to find snowflake.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{when we find marino, we'll deliver snowflake.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{when i find snowflake, i will deliver marino.}
<A>__{he exits.}
