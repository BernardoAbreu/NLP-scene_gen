<L>__{exterior big o parking lot morning}
<A>__{the regular redskins are out in force, holding signs as they lean on their beamers and porsches. shane pulls up in a battered '89 honda. when he gets out, he's immediately surrounded by six striking regulars, led by quarterback eddie martel and defensive end wilson jones.}
<C>__{martel}
<D>__{hey, you can't park there.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{look, i don't want any trouble.}
<C>__{martel}
<D>__{you don't want any trouble?! you're taking my job away, but you don't want any trouble?}
<P>__{(to wilson)}
<D>__{he doesn't want any trouble, but he puts this piece of shit in a no parking zone.}
<A>__{shane looks but it's obvious he's parked legally.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{okay. i will move it.}
<C>__{martel}
<D>__{no, we'll do that for you. go ahead, wilson. move it for him.}
<A>__{wilson motions to another big guy. the two of them proceed to roll the honda over on its roof. it lands with a crunch.}
<C>__{jamal }
<D>__{you all put that car back.}
<A>__{everybody turns to see andre and jamal walking towards them.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{who the fuck are you?}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{we're the people who take care of the quarterback. we're the guards.}
<A>__{all the regulars laugh at this.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{put the car back. gently.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{kiss my ass.}
<C>__{shane}
<P>__{(to jamal)}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{no, it's not.}
<A>__{jamal points to a gorgeous midnight blue porsche.}
<C>__{jamal}
<P>__{(to wilson)}
<D>__{that's your ride, ain't it?}
<A>__{before wilson can even answer, jamal pulls his nine millimeter. boom! boom! no more porsche windshield. all the regular redskins dive for cover.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{my windshield! you crazy motherfucker!}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{move his car back.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{my car!}
<A>__{jamal raises his gun again. pow! no porsche driver's side window.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{no! stop!}
<A>__{he turns to his cowering teammates.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{come on, help me, god damn it!}
<A>__{the guys quickly pick up the honda and put it right side up.}
<C>__{wilson}
<P>__{(to jamal)}
<D>__{you are gonna pay for this.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{no i'm not. and quit messing with my man here. that includes his ride.}
<A>__{jamal spins the nine and holsters it. andre and jamal get on either side of shane. they look at each other and then quickly switch sides.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{let's go to practice, shane.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{let's do that.}
<A>__{shane smiles at his guards, smiles at the still shocked redskins, and they move out.}
