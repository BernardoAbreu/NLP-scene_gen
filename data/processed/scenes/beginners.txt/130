<A>__{ginsberg's reading continues over: oliver flips through a mock up he made for "the sads" it's all the happy faces from 1950's advertising that we saw in the last scene. one face per panel. later: the three members of "the sads" and a record company rep arrive. jelly roll morton piano plays, we see but do not hear the meeting take place. the sads look at the designs, which include many of the "history of sadness" drawings we have seen now in cd cover format and no portraits of the band. it's clear that the sads are not into oliver's work.}
