<L>__{interior the houses of parliament, lobby corridor day}
<A>__{a few minutes later, disraeli and stanley are strolling down the busy lobby corridor. throughout their talk, tory back benchers bustle up to pat their hero on the back and offer their congratulations.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{should we take it seriously?}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{the cartoon or her majesty's absenteeism?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{well, both.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{the question is, do we need her?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{surely, you're not suggesting we dispense }
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{my dear stanley, a prime minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.}
<A>__{the pass gladstone in a huddle of cohorts.}
<C>__{disraeli }
<D>__{gossip counts. lord aberdeen was right. this country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{we'll see which way the wind blows.}
<A>__{disraeli sweeps through a prattle of back benchers.}
