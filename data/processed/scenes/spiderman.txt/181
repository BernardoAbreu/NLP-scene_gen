<A>__{red power throttle is at 95% power! spider man and roz enter, shielding their eyes from the glare. the countdown clock reads, "00:08:18".}

<D>__{aha! you never included the conjunction in your calculations, did you?! rosomorf!}
<C>__{roz}
<D>__{damn the calculations! my god, otto, you have to hear me! the world we know will collapse! everything we have devoted our lives to... all the patterns, all the harmonies... everything will be destroyed.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{a new world waits! rosomorf! it is my destiny!!!}
<C>__{roz}
<D>__{it is cosmic suicide! you have no right!}
<A>__{roz flings himself through the melted window into the experimental chamber. he grabs for the "bullet" but the waldos grab him and throw him back. roz staggers backward... into the arms of spider man.}
<C>__{roz}
<D>__{you have to stop him... spider man you have to stop him. spider man i'm afraid we're too late.}
<A>__{spider man attacks ock, trying to push him away from the throttle. ock pushes spider man away from him so strongly that spider man is knocked down. ock nudges the power throttle forward and the whine increases to an ear shattering pitch. the countdown clock reads, "00:06:48". we are at 96% power!}
