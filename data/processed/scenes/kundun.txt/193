<L>__{interior dalai lama's room day}
<A>__{this time the oracle is in the room first. he is surrounded by his attendants and the members of the kashag, the lord chamberlain, ling rinpoche and various tutors and lamas. the tension is thick. finally, the dalai lama enters. tenzin gyatso sits. he waits. the trance begins, the headdress is set upon the medium's head and the oracle begins to dance, and then, he begins to shout:}
<C>__{oracle}
<D>__{go! go! tonight!}
<A>__{the oracle staggers forward, snatches up some paper and a pen and begins to draw a map, a route, out of lhasa. he keeps repeating:}
<C>__{oracle}
<D>__{go! tonight! go!}
<A>__{close on the map drawn with a shaking, sweating hand. we see mountains, and a pass, and the names of towns along the way. tenzin gyatso rises and goes to the oracle. he looks down at the map. the oracle hands the dalai lama the map and faints as his frightened attendants rush to loosen the strap of the headdress before the poor man chokes.}
