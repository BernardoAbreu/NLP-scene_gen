<A>__{eric and corbett trudge up to the bank of a frozen stream bisecting their path. it's simple to continue, they have to cross it. corbett takes in the scenery, in no particular hurry. frustrated, but making dead sure he's always got the drop on corbett, eric puts a tentative foot on the ice.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{ice is too thin you can see the water moving underneath.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{we're not sitting here 'til november. there's a cargo plane coming to devil's cauldron in four days, and i'm putting you on it.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{we get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i've been on ice like this when i was a kid, skating. spread your weight, keep moving. go on.}
<A>__{corbett is not about to be outdone in the guts department by someone with a master's degree.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(gestures 'you first')}
<D>__{be my guest.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(points .357)}
<D>__{i'm right behind you.}
<A>__{frowning, corbett tentatively steps onto the ice and inches across the fifteen feet to the other bank.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{he turns and, indeed, eric is right behind him.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{wait 'til i'm across!}
<A>__{eric doesn't want to be too far from his prisoner. he keeps coming. the ice groans and hisses under their weight. corbett is three feet from solid ground. he drops to his knees, then stomach, and rolls like a log the rest of the way. eric splays out on the ice and crabwalks across. the ice makes an ominous cracking and water begins to seep through air holes. standing, corbett weighs his chances of bolting from eric. eric crawls doubletime. he makes it onto solid ground just as the ice under him breaks off in a big, thin, clear plate.}
<B>__{closer}
<A>__{eric sits on some rocks. corbett glares it him.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{most dangerous thing in the world: a regular joe, in over his head. you trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{it wasn't my idea to crash the plane.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{let's camp. there's grayling under this ice. i will snare some for dinner.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{we've got another two hours of daylight.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{pushing it is flat wrong. all you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail.}
<A>__{eric is not convinced. grumbling, corbett gets up and takes the lead as they continue southward.}
