<L>__{interior dragon mountain valka's living quarters late}
<C>__{afternoon}
<A>__{(scene 1850 the last dance) as toothless and cloudjumper hover for scraps, stoick and valka prepare skewers of fish. she's overwhelmed, lost in her thoughts, and covering it up poorly.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{mom, you'd never recognize it! where we used to make weapons, we now build saddles, wing slings we even fix dragon teeth! you wouldn't believe how much everything's changed!}
<A>__{valka offers a skittish half smile and hands him a plate.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{our son's changed berk for the better. i think we did well with this one, val.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{thanks, dad.}
<A>__{stoick places his hands on valka's shoulders. she flinches, dropping the plate. cloudjumper steals the fish before toothless can get to it. toothless whimpers, and as a sign of acceptance, cloudjumper regurgitates the fish so toothless can have some.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{i'm... a little out of practice.}
<C>__{stoick}
<P>__{(sweetly)}
<D>__{well, y'know... i didn't marry you for your cooking.}
<C>__{gobber}
<P>__{(to hiccup and grump)}
<D>__{i hope not. her meatballs could kill more beasts than a battle axe.}
<C>__{gobber }
<D>__{i've still got a few knocking around in here. ha ha!}
<A>__{gobber takes a bite, gags, and dump the entire plate of fish skewers into grump's mouth like a trash can.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{and once you move back in, with all of your dragons, drago won't even stand a chance. everything will be okay!}
<A>__{stoick can see that valka is overwhelmed. he lays a hand upon hiccup's shoulder, calming him.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{slow down, son. it's a lot to take in.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{oh. gotcha.}
<A>__{valka crosses the room to fill a flask with water, back turned to the group, as stoick eyes her sympathetically. he decides on a different approach... and whistles a familiar tune. on valka, as her eyes widen, stirred, recognizing the melody. she turns away from stoick, as the water overflows from the flask.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{oh, i love this one!}
<A>__{stoick approaches her delicately.}
<C>__{stoick}
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{remember our song, val?}
<A>__{hiccup watches him, curious, as stoick fumbles through the first verse of an old viking courting song:}
<C>__{stoick }
<P>__{(singing softly)}
<D>__{i will swim and sail on savage seas, with ne'er a fear of drowning. and gladly ride the waves of life, if you will marry me.}
<A>__{valka avoids his gaze, wallowing in a mess of emotions.}
<C>__{stoick }
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{no scorching sun, nor freezing cold will }
<C>__{gobber}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{ will stop me on my journey!}
<P>__{(catching himself, embarrassed)}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{stoick scowls at him, then returns his attention to valka.}
<C>__{stoick}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{if you will promise me your heart...}
<A>__{stoick pauses, setting valka up for her part of the duet.}
<C>__{stoick }
<D>__{and love...}
<A>__{stoick hangs eagerly, awaiting her words, but valka closes her eyes, rejecting his invitation. he lets out a heavy hearted sigh. but nostalgia gets the better of valka. she softly sings her part:}
<C>__{valka}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{and love me for eternity.}
<A>__{stoick beams. she brushes past him, setting into the center of the chamber and holding her forearm aloft in invitation. stoick crosses his forearm against hers, initiating a beautiful dance to accompany the song.}
<C>__{valka }
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{my dearest one, my darling dear, you mighty words astound me. but i've no need of mighty deeds, when i feel your arms around me.}
<A>__{the dance is full of charming missteps as stoick and valka recreate a moment from their past, before hiccup's wonder struck eyes.}
<C>__{stoick}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{but i would bring you rings of gold. i'd even sing you poetry.}
<C>__{stoick }
<D>__{and i would keep you from all harm, if you'd stay here beside me.}
<C>__{valka}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{i have no use for rings of gold. i care not for your poetry. i only want your hand to hold. i only want you near me.}
<A>__{gobber can't help himself. he drags hiccup onto his feet so that he can join in the dancing, too.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{c'mon, hiccup! valka, stoick, & gobber}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{to love and kiss, to sweetly hold. for the dancing and the dreaming. through all life's sorrows and delights, i will keep your love inside me.}
<A>__{hiccup is amazed by the sight of his giddy parents, spinning and laughing in each others' arms, reunited.}
<P>__{valka, stoick, & gobber (cont'd) (singing)}
<D>__{i will swim and sail through savage seas, with ne'er a fear of drowning. and gladly ride the waves of life, if you will marry me!}
<A>__{gobber carries the last note...}
<C>__{gobber}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{i'm still going...}
<A>__{hiccup taps him.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{gobber!}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{i'm done.}
<A>__{valka and stoick slow to a stop, winded and laughing.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{ah... i thought i'd have to die before we'd have that dance again.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{no need for drastic measures.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{for you, my dear... anything.}
<A>__{she smiles sweetly. stoick's eyes well with tears. he goes down on one knee, proposing to her anew.}
<C>__{stoick }
<D>__{will you come home, val? will you be my wife once again?}
<A>__{toothless nudges valka closer to stoick. they laugh as hiccup joins them. stoick throws his arm around him.}
<C>__{stoick }
<D>__{we can be a family! what do you say?}
<A>__{valka, between tears and laughter, turns to hiccup.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{yes!}
<A>__{gobber pops his head in.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{great! i will do the cooking!}
<A>__{they laugh.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{thank odin you didn't listen to me, son. we never would have found each other.}
<A>__{suddenly, toothless and cloudjumper suddenly perk up, sensing something unheard. hiccup notices.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{toothless?}
<A>__{dragons swarm past valka's chamber, racing toward some unknown disturbance.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{what's happening?}
<A>__{they're answered by subsequent heavy booms that reverberate through the fortress.}
