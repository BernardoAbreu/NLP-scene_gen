<L>__{interior kirk's quarters}
<A>__{the doors opening, kirk entering, mccoy moves to b.g. while decker stands attentively, waiting as kirk turns to him.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{explanation, mr. decker: why was my phaser order countermanded?}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(cool, polite)}
<D>__{sir, the enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. when they went into anti matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.}
<A>__{kirk is surprised by this information, perhaps slight ly chagrined. after a beat:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{then you acted properly, of course.}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{thank you, sir. i'm sorry i embar rassed you.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you saved the ship.}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(coolly)}
<D>__{i'm aware of that, sir.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(flaring)}
<D>__{stop competing with me, decker!}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{permission to speak freely, sir?}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(tight)}
<D>__{granted.}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. that, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.}
<A>__{kirk reacts with anger. struggles for and regains control.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, mister?}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{yes, sir, i will do that.}
<A>__{kirk peers at decker, who stands facing him determinedly.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{then i won't keep you from your duties any longer, commander.}
<P>__{(whirling at mccoy)}
<D>__{yes, doctor?}
<A>__{kirk's last line has drowned out decker's "aye, sir." mccoy says nothing, waits until decker is gone and the door closes behind him. then:}
<D>__{mccoy he may not be wrong, jim.}
