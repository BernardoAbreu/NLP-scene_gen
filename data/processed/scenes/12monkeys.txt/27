<L>__{interior hospital dayroom half an hour later (day)}
<A>__{cole stands in the doorway, stunned by his first sight of the large room. his eyes go to the heavily grilled windows where light pours in from outside. then, to the tv, where a cartoon commercial makes raucous noises. patients, in k mart street clothes or ratty robes, stare gloomily at the tv, or play cards, pace, or just stare blankly. billings is at cole's side, beckoning to a patient, jeffrey mason, a twenty year old white youth dressed in khakis and a plaid shirt.}
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{jeffrey. yo! jeffrey. this here is james. whyncha show james around? tell him the tv rules, show him the games an' stuff, okay?}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<P>__{(with a sly look)}
<D>__{how much you gonna pay me? huh? i'd be doing your job.}
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{five thousand dollars, my man. that enough? i will wire it to your account as usual, okay?}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{okay, billings. five thousand. that's enough. five thousand dollars. i will give him the deluxe mental hospital tour.}
<A>__{as billings walks away chuckling, jeffrey turns to cole.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{kid around, kid around. it makes them feel good, we're all pals. we're prisoners, they're the guards, but it's all in good fun, you see?}
<A>__{cole nods and jeffrey indicates card tables where patients are playing cards, checkers, chess, or working on jig saw puzzles.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{here's the games. games vegitize you. if you play the games, you're voluntarily taking a tranquilizer.}
<A>__{cole sees a partially completed puzzle of the well known painting, the peaceable kingdom, depicting a serene world of animals in harmony.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{what'd they give you? thorazine? how much? learn your drugs know your doses.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i need to make a telephone call.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{a telephone call? that's communication with the outside world! doctor's discretion. hey, if alla these nuts could just make phone calls, it could spread. insanity oozing through telephone cables, oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people, infecting them! whackos everywhere! a plague of madness.}
<P>__{(suddenly sly and confidential)}
<D>__{in fact, very few of us here are actually mentally ill. i'm not saying you're not mentally ill, for all i know you're crazy as a loon. but that's not why you're here. why you're here is because of the system, because of the economy.}
<P>__{(indicating the tv)}
<D>__{there's the tv. it's all right there. commercials. we are not productive anymore, they don't need us to make things anymore, it's all automated. what are we for then? we're consumers. okay, buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen. but if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you know what? you're mentally ill! that's a fact! if you don't buy things...toilet paper, new cars, computerized blenders, electrically operated sexual devices...}
<P>__{(getting hysterical)}
<D>__{screwdrivers with miniature built in radar devices, stereo systems with brain implanted headphones, voice activated computers, and...}
<A>__{a woman orderly, terry, turns from the feeble patient she's helping.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{take it easy, jeffrey. be calm.}
<A>__{abruptly, jeffrey stifles his hysteria, takes a deep breath and continues, completely calm now. but cole isn't listening. he's mesmerized by the tv.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{so if you want to watch a particular program, say "all my children" or something, you go to the charge nurse and tell her what day and time the show you want to see is on. but you have to tell her before the show is scheduled to be on. there was this one guy who was always requesting shows that had already played. he couldn't quite grasp the idea that the charge nurse couldn't just make it be yesterday for him, turn back time ha ha. what a fruitcake!!}
<A>__{this last thought actually penetrates cole's focus on the tv and he turns to jeffrey who's picking up speed again.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{seriously, more and more people are being defined now as mentally ill. why? because they're not consuming on their own. but as patients, they becone consumers of mental health care. and this gives the so called sane people work!}
<P>__{(hysteria again)}
<D>__{whooo! shock therapy! group therapy! hallucinations! therapeutic drugs! iggidy diggidy dig! perfect! the system in harmony like a big machine...}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{okay, that's it, jeffrey, you're gonna get a shot. i warned you...}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<P>__{(calming himself, smiling)}
<D>__{right! right! carried away, heh heh. i got "carried away". explaining the workings of...the institution.}
<A>__{just then, tj washington, a somber looking african american in a bathrobe, taps cole on the shoulder.}
<C>__{tj washington}
<D>__{i don't really come from outer space.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{this is tj washington, jim he doesn't really come from outer space.}
<C>__{tj washington}
<D>__{don't mock me, my friend.}
<P>__{(to cole)}
<D>__{it's a condition of "mental divergence". i find myself on another planet, ogo, part of an intellectual elite, preparing to subjugate barbarian hordes on pluto. but even though it's a totally convincing reality in every way...i can feel, breathe, hear...nevertheless, ogo is actually a construct of my psyche. i am mentally divergent in that i am escaping certain unnamed realities that plague my life here. when i stop going there, i will be well. are you also divergent, friend?}
<A>__{the p.a. system interrupts, startling cole.}
<C>__{p.a. system }
<D>__{james cole. report to staff. james cole!}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{staff! whoo! time for staff. now the geniuses cure you. hallelujah!}
