<L>__{interior bretton woods's office night}
<A>__{jacob waits for bretton. he looks over the place. the view of the park. the classic furniture.}
<B>__{and the huge painting on the wall}
<A>__{of a giant man like monster eating a much smaller naked human. the smaller man's head's been bitten off and blood drips down the body. jacob holds on the painting.}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{saturno devorando a sus hijos.}
<A>__{as jacob turns to see bretton standing in the doorway.}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{saturn devouring his son. francisco goya.}
<A>__{bretton heads in and closes the door behind him.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{do you collect?}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{sitting behind his desk...}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{only the obsessive compulsive or the insecure egotistical feel the need to collect things.}
<A>__{jacob nods. bretton just looks at him... making him nervous.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{your daughter's an amazing piano player. that was quite a show.}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{that wasn't my daughter. that was isabel patrovsky, she's the world's greatest living piano prodigy.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and that wasn't a show... that was a very expensive private recital.}
<A>__{there's a long beat of silence with jacob just looking at bretton... taking him in. and it's unmistakable the one thing that this man exudes above all else... is composure.}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{you cost my fund three hundred and forty million dollars today.}
<A>__{off of jacob's slight smile...}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{yeah, kills my year, pushes my watermark higher and might cause redemptions.}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i hope you're happy. my fund's in trouble now.}
<A>__{jacob just shrugs.}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{you don't want to deny it?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{who told you?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{a doctor i know.}
<A>__{bretton nods... regards him.}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{i checked with all the desks in town... you didn't make money off it.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{then why did you do it?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you destroyed my firm.}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{your firm destroyed itself.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you killed andrew zabel.}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{andrew zabel killed himself.}
<A>__{and bretton sighs...}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{the rumors were true.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you made them true.}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{no, jacob, being levered thirty eight to one in toxic debt made them true.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{institutional money running was zabel's talent... he didn't have a down year in the last twenty.}
<A>__{jacob just glares at him.}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{his fatal flaw was allowing the children on his mortgage security desk to talk him into the deadly game of hot potato everybody's been so fond of playing recently.}
<A>__{and jacob holds bretton's look for a moment, then... heads for the door without saying a thing...}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{come work for me.}
<A>__{jacob stops and turns...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{i run three billion dollars. come help me run it.}
<A>__{and jacob takes a beat... processing this...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{why me?}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{because your loyalty desired revenge, your balls actually attempted it and your skills pulled it off.}
<A>__{as he stands...}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{and as for andrew zabel... there really is no telling why he did what he did.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{as far as i'm concerned, it was just a bit of money... and there are surely more important things in the world.}
<A>__{and jacob sucks in a deep breath containing his anger.}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{now i'm going on safari with my family. think about the offer and get in touch after the july 4th holiday.}
<A>__{... heading for the door...}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{you got my attention, jacob... and that's one of the rarest commodities out there.}
<A>__{and jacob just regards him, then...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you can have my answer now, bretton... i have no interest in working for a fund that's in trouble.}
<A>__{bretton smiles...}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{touche.}
<A>__{jacob nods... holding bretton's look. then...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what's your number?}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{the amount of money you would need to be able to walk away from it all and just live happily ever after.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{everybody has one it's an exact number what's yours?}
<A>__{and bretton takes a moment to think about that, then simply says...}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{more.}
<A>__{... and disappears into his penthouse.}
