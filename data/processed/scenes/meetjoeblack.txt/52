<L>__{interior salon, parrish townhouse night}
<A>__{after dinner, parrish, allison and susan are gathered to gether. at the bar on the other side of the room, joe watches as quince pours himself a stiff hooker of brandy.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to quince)}
<D>__{cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult western males.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{i didn't know that.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{on the other hand, winston churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety one.}
<A>__{after a moment.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{you're an original, joe. a little hard to figure, maybe...}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{and you're a nice man, quince.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{drew appears unannounced in the doorway, exchanges a tense glance with susan, then heads straight for parrish who seems surprised to see him.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(to parrish)}
<D>__{sorry to intrude, bill, but we've got a bit of a crisis downtown it's not something we could talk about on the phone.}
<A>__{parrish takes drew aside.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{the board's real unhappy, pappy they felt you dealt with them pre emptorily, you never gave them a chance to speak }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what is there to say? they know what john bontecou is and if they didn't, they know now.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{yes, you made your feeling abun dantly clear. now they want to do the same with theirs.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what are their feelings?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{if i read this board right now, they want you to accept bontecou's offer.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{over my dead body.}
<A>__{parrish's burgeoning anger has now gotten the attention of joe, susan, quince and allison.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{what do you think the board is going to say when i tell them that?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i don't care.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{with all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor.}
<A>__{silence, parrish carefully calibrating drew's remark.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{whose?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{yours.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i'm just giving you the truth. there was a time when william parrish liked the truth.}
<A>__{joe, although across the room, is all attention.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i think it's time you went home, drew.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{certainly. goodnight.}
<A>__{drew goes, everybody is in shock, susan pursues him out into the hallway.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{drew!}
<A>__{he stops.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{never talk to my father like that again.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{don't worry about it. there's a beginning and a middle and an end to everything. and i think i've come to the end of my chapter with the parrishes.}
<A>__{joe has followed them into the hallway.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{and the end began with this guy.}
<A>__{drew looks down towards joe.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{mr. black ? we ran a check on you and you know what we came up with?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no, i don't }
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{not good, not bad, you know what we got? nothing. no credit, no cars, no mortgages no wives. nothing.}
<A>__{joe waits.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{all of a sudden a guy appears on the scene with the chairman of one of the greatest communications corpora tions of the world, the boss makes him privy to all the company's secrets, he attends the board meet ings, and us working stiffs with mba's up the ass and years and years and years of experience, we're left outside with our noses pressed against the window.}
<A>__{joe doesn't respond.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{this is a big time operation, deal ing in big time issues, demanding big time executives who make big time decisions. so, joe, why don't you tell me exactly what it is that's big time about you?}
<A>__{after a moment.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you first.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(to drew)}
<D>__{why don't you get off his case?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{oh, you're the great joe's attorney now? are we going to go to court? or are we going to go to bed? and i don't mean you and me. i mean you and him.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{that's it. it's over. get out.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{so i guess a blowjob's out of the question?}
<A>__{joe clears his throat.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{did you say something?}
<A>__{joe considers him evenly.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{almost.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(to drew)}
<D>__{i said get out.}
<A>__{now drew wheels, heads right for the front door and exits with a slam.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what an angry fellow.}
<A>__{a moment passes before susan realizes she and joe are alone, and joe does as well.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i'm sorry about }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{please. we don't need to talk about drew.}
<A>__{she regards joe.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{no. we don't.}
<A>__{they drift, osmotically, into the library in awkward silence.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{brave you had a chance to look at dad's rare books? jefferson's parliamentary manual, a first edition bleak house }
<A>__{joe comes closer, takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i love your smell.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{ i guess you haven't.}
<A>__{now susan, close to joe, leans closer, her nose in joe's neck. joe holds himself very still.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{i like your smell, too.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{it was everything.}
<A>__{silence, the ticking of the clock.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{when i was little, my mother used to say, "darling, you could set your heart by this clock".}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ could you?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{never tried, 'til now.}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{joe, may i kiss you?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{why, yes. thank you.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<A>__{susan reaches out for joe, they kiss, he is awkward but his very awkwardness endearing. susan pulls him closer, they linger now, mouths on each other's, then separate.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<A>__{the clock ticks on. a sense of foreboding falls over joe's face, his fear that he is passing through some barrier, a point of no return.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{joe?}
<A>__{the apprehensive expression on joe's face fades away.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i don't know who you are.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well...i'm uh, joe. and you're susan. and i uh have this weak feeling in my knees }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{and is your heart beating strangely?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{faster. and i want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me forever.}
<A>__{an intake of breath. she is about to speak.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{and you don't even have to say a word.}
<A>__{their faces inches from each other's.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i have to go home.}
<A>__{but neither susan nor joe moves.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{don't i?}
<A>__{her question makes joe, almost involuntarily, smile. susan takes the opportunity to step back from him. the sound of someone at the door, it is parrish, susan turns, comprehends immediately how the situation will appear to him.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{goodnight, daddy.}
<A>__{she drifts right past him, exits. joe and parrish are left alone now, eyes on each other's.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{hello, bill.}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{hello. would you like to join me, quince and allison for a nightcap?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{um not right now.}
<A>__{an awkward moment.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{okay. goodnight.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{goodnight.}
<A>__{parrish turns and exits, joe's head inclines, he breathes in the scent of his collar.}
