<L>__{interior dad's office day continuous}
<A>__{kale enters, goes to the desk, sits at dad's computer, clicking keys as ashley and ronnie enter }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{kale, why are you so }
<A>__{ashley and ronnie stop in their tracks at the mess. note: up till now, the office has been in reasonably good order. but now, it's noticeably different. wider the shades are drawn. soda cans everywhere... papers are spread on the floor: printed out full color gruesome crime scene photos, black & white autopsy photos of the murdered redheads... more pictures of the girl who disappeared, patricia walsh. "missing" flyers... over the above, ronnie leans down, lifts a couple of books out of an amazon.com box: "murderer: tell tale signs of a serial killer" and "the shrine of jeffrey dahmer" the titles ashley was referencing earlier. ronnie shows them to ashley who takes a receipt out of a nearby home depot box on the page smith's universal garage door remote qty (1) $29.99. ashley and ronnie turn to kale. they notice on the wall behind him, hanging next to his dad's book cover posters, a black and white poster size satellite photo of the neighborhood. giles' house is circled and labeled in flourescent ink. kale finally looks up, notices them looking }
<C>__{kale}
<P>__{(re: satellite poster)}
<D>__{ronnie, you've seen this satellite website, right? you can find any location on earth and take a picture }
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yeah, for a small fee }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{kale, what are you doing?}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{trying to get to the bottom of this.}
<C>__{ashley}
<P>__{(delicately)}
<D>__{kale, right now, it doesn't look that way.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{what's it look like?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{like you're determined to turn giles in to who you think he is.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{not who i think.}
<C>__{ashley}
<P>__{(beat; then)}
<D>__{i just didn't realize you were this }
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{what, crazy? maybe i am. but maybe i'm right.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{it's not about that, it's about }
<P>__{(beat; then quietly)}
<D>__{ what i see. what ronnie and i are seeing right now. i see a guy who looks like he hasn't slept in days.}
<P>__{(peers at dad's book cover posters)}
<D>__{i'm seeing you sitting at your dad's desk }
<A>__{that gets kale's attention.}
<C>__{ashley }
<D>__{ because you lost him before maybe... you ever really knew him. before the world according to kale took a hit from that same stuff you were telling me about, remember? all those curveballs? but it's like it's like you're still trying to dodge them by forcing pieces together that are never gonna fit... by getting all wrapped up in...}
<P>__{(re: mess)}
<D>__{this.}
<P>__{(beat; then)}
<D>__{obsessing's not gonna "protect you," kale. it's not gonna make the hurt go away.}
<A>__{kale locks eyes with ashley. a long beat, then }
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{are you two gonna help me or not?}
<A>__{ashley pauses, shocked she hasn't gotten through to kale. then }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i want to.}
<C>__{kale}
<P>__{(picks up a stack)}
<D>__{then start looking through these }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{that's not what i meant.}
<C>__{kale}
<P>__{(beat; then)}
<D>__{well, this is all i need, so i guess i will see you later.}
<A>__{ashley and ronnie trade looks. then ashley leaves. ronnie turns back to kale.}
<C>__{kale }
<D>__{so what's your deal? you hanging out or not?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i would, dude, but i've gotta pull it together and change my underwear. catch you later?}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{ronnie leaves. kale sits in silence, his thoughts unreadable }
