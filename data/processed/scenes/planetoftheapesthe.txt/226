<P>__{(promptly)}
<D>__{and our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{at the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.}
<C>__{honorius}

<D>__{objection. the accused is indeed a man. therefore, he has no rights under ape law.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{well, dr. zira? this is a man, is he not?}
