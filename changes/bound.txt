<TRANS>__{FADE IN:}
<ACTION>__{Inside a closet. It is a large closet with double doors, a crisp line of light cutting down through the center of the darkness. As we begin to descend, voices echo in our head.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{I had this image of you, inside of me, like a part of me.}
<ACTION>__{We move past a shelf filled with hatboxes and handbags.  It is a woman's closet.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{You planned this whole thing, didn't you?}
<CHAR>__{CAESAR } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{Where's the fucking money?}
<ACTION>__{We glide over the tightly packed hangers, close enough to feel the different fabrics and descend past the dresses to the racks of high heels.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.}
<CHAR>__{CAESAR } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{All part of the business.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{All part of the business.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{What choice?}
<ACTION>__{We slide along the delicate taper of a stiletto heel and reach the bottom of the closet, where we find a pair of black Dr. Martens boots that are tied together with a white rope.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{I want out.}
<ACTION>__{We move up the boots and we see it is a woman who is bound, lying motionless on the floor of the closet, the rope coiling tightly around her wrists. The crack at the bottom of the door lights her face.  She is gagged and unconscious, a trickle of blood running down her forehead.  Her name is CORKY.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{Like a part of me.}
<TRANS>__{CUT TO:}
<LOC>__{INT.  ELEVATOR - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Leaning against the back of the elevator is Corky, a very butch-looking woman with short hair and a black leather jacket.  She is a lesbian and wants people to know it. As the doors begin to slide shut, a woman yells.}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Wait!  Hold the elevator.}
<ACTION>__{Corky pushes the "open" button.  A couple steps into the elevator.  His name is CAESAR, a middle-aged Italian, wearing an expensive suit and sunglasses. She is VIOLET; a piece of sexual candy that would melt in your mouth. She hears it again, a guttural sound.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thanks again for this opportunity, Mr. Bianchinni.  Goodbye.}
<ACTION>__{She hangs up the phone and walks toward the wall. As she gets closer, we hear a bed rocking, tapping against the wall. The man's breathing grows more and more labored until finally it swells --}
<TRANS>__{DISSOLVING INTO:}
<LOC>__{INT.  BATHROOM - MORNING}
<ACTION>__{The whining motor of a high-powered drain-rod. The spiral cable whips wildly, spiraling deeper into the tub drain, black goo splattering everywhere. The machine is so loud Corky almost cannot hear someone pounding on the apartment door. Killing the motor, she stands and goes to the door. Behind the door is Violet, wearing jeans, a white T-shirt and cowboy boots.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of met in the elevator --}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee?}
<ACTION>__{She is holding two cups of coffee: one black, one with cream.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sure.  Come on in.  Give me a minute.}
<ACTION>__{Violet steps inside as Corky goes back to the bathroom to wash off the drain dreck.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What happened to Rajeev?}
<ACTION>__{Corky calls from the bathroom, scrubbing her hands vigorously.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Who?}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, he went home to India, but as far as I know he'll be back.}
<ACTION>__{She wipes her hands on her overalls, returning to the main room.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So this is temporary for you?}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Pretty much.  One day at a time.}
<ACTION>__{Violet hands her the cup of black coffee.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I guessed you were straight black.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Good guess.}
<ACTION>__{They both sip from the piping hot mugs.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{A favor?}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, I'm sorry --}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Are they really?}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're doing everything yourself?}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.}
<ACTION>__{She looks at Corky's hands cupped around the mug.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah ...  I bet your car is twenty years old.}
<ACTION>__{Corky smiles.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Truck.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Truck.  Of course.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{'63 Chevy.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I knew it.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{VIOLET SIPS}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't, really.  I was referred to him.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, really.}
<ACTION>__{Corky suddenly feels she has revealed something.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Do you know him?}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Caesar is your husband?}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.}
<ACTION>__{Smiling, she says nothing else.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thanks.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{My pleasure.}
<ACTION>__{CORKY watches her leave.}
<LOC>__{EXT.  THE WATERING HOLE - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A dirty bar hidden away on a dark street, its cracked, moon- white sign the only evidence it exists. Corky's truck swings into a space in front of a couple of large motorcycles.  She flips her collar and heads for the door.}
<LOC>__{INT.  THE WATERING HOLE - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The smell of leather and cigarette smoke fills Corky's nose as she crosses to the bar.}
<CHAR>__{BARTENDER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, well ...}
<ACTION>__{Corky sits as the fat bartender waddles over.}
<CHAR>__{BARTENDER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Been awhile, Cork.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Five years, two months, sixteen days. How you doing, Sue?}
<ACTION>__{Corky puts a cigarette in her mouth and lights it.}
<CHAR>__{SUE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Like shit.  Now that we're all caught up, how about a drink?}
<ACTION>__{Sue opens the refrigerator and pulls out two Old Styles.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thanks.}
<ACTION>__{They click the bottles together and drink.}
<CHAR>__{SUE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You got a job yet?}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah.  Some plumbing, painting and shit.}
<ACTION>__{Sue laughs.}
<CHAR>__{SUE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I mean a J-O-B.  A real job.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not for me, Sue.  I'm straight and narrow.  I'm just here to get laid or drunk and hopefully both.}
<ACTION>__{Corky gets off the stool.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thanks for the beer.}
<ACTION>__{Looking around, she sees a woman alone at one of the back tables.  Through the smoky din, she bears a slight resemblance to Violet. The woman is dressed all in black, including a leather jacket. Smiling, Corky slides into the chair beside her.  There is no one smoother.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hi.}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hello.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know ...  that outfit would look great on my bedroom floor.}
<ACTION>__{The woman smiles just as someone taps Corky on the shoulder. She turns and is face-to-face with a large bull of a woman in a heavy leather Chicago Police jacket.  She is more wide than fat.}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN COP} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey, Jesse.  What's happening here?}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Nothing ...  yet.}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN COP} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Who's this?}
<ACTION>__{Her coat opens as she puts her hands on her hips.  A service revolver is clipped to her belt. She squints at Corky, her head nodding in recognition.}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN COP} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Wait, I know you.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't think so.}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN COP} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I didn't know you were out.}
<ACTION>__{Corky smiles at the woman in black.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{When you get tired of Cagney and Lacey, come find me.}
<ACTION>__{She heads for the exit.}
<LOC>__{EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The neighborhood would be politely described as "rough." Corky's truck does not stand out parked alone on the littered street.}
<LOC>__{INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{It is a hole but it is home. Corky is lying on her futon staring up at the ceiling, a beer resting on her stomach; a folk singer quietly croons from the radio. We see the ceiling, a circle of light hovering over the small desk lamp.  We move in on the spot, which slowly fills up the screen until there is nothing but the white light. Suddenly a wet paint roller loaded with white paint cuts a swath across the ceiling.}
<TRANS>__{MATCH CUT TO:}
<LOC>__{INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Corky is painting the ceiling.  The folk ballad has become an angry Riot Grrrl anthem. She is working hard, the roller sucking back and forth. Sweat covers her face. Dropping the roller down, she reloads it in the tray when the phone rings.  She stops and answers it.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hello?  Oh, hi, Mr. Bianchinni ... yes, everything is going fine.  I got the tub drain all cleaned out.}
<ACTION>__{She listens for a moment.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What apartment?}
<ACTION>__{She glances at the main wall.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{All right, all right, I guess I could take a look.  Yeah, you're welcome, goodbye.}
<ACTION>__{She hangs up and looks again at the wall, feeling...  curious.}
<LOC>__{INT.  HALL - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Corky knocks and after a moment Violet opens the door.  She seems surprised.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would call you.  God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not exactly.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He said you lost something.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, come on in.}
<ACTION>__{She steps back and Corky walks inside.}
<LOC>__{INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Violet leads her through the apartment.  It is expensively furnished with very masculine tastes; a lot of gray and black leather.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I was doing some dishes and just as I pulled the stopper my earring fell in.}
<ACTION>__{Corky looks at her blankly.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's one of my favorites.  That's why I got upset.  I know it probably seems ridiculous to you.}
<ACTION>__{An eyebrow goes up.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?}
<ACTION>__{Violet nods. She opens the sink cabinet and pulls out a pair of channel locks from her back pocket.  The teeth of the channel locks open and bite onto the pressure nut.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Do you have a pot or a bucket?}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sure.}
<ACTION>__{She hands one down to her.  Corky slides it under the curved pipe. As she works, Corky feels herself staring at Violet, at the hem of her dress curving tightly around her thighs. Water begins to trickle into the pan. The nut slides loose and Corky tips the trap.  Water splashes into the pan with a soft metal "tink."}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Did you find it?}
<ACTION>__{Corky fishes into gray water and pulls out the earring. Violet screams, a huge smile on her face, half-falling as she tries to hug Corky.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I can't believe it!  You did it!}
<ACTION>__{Corky leans back under and replaces the trap.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.}
<ACTION>__{Corky checks the drain by running the water.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{If you won't take money, how about a drink?  It's getting late.  You can't work all night.}
<ACTION>__{Corky eyes her for a moment.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay, one drink.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What do you want?}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{A beer?}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{A beer.  Of course.}
<ACTION>__{She smiles and turns to the bar.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sit down.}
<ACTION>__{Corky sits on the black leather couch and Violet returns with two bottles of Heineken.  Corky sneers.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thanks again.}
<ACTION>__{They clink the bottles and swig.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make you nervous, Corky?}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.}
<ACTION>__{She looks at Violet, then takes another long pull on the bottle.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thirsty, maybe.}
<ACTION>__{Violet smiles, her eyes again talking for her.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Curious, maybe.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.}
<ACTION>__{Violet notices the tattoo on Corky's arm.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's a great tattoo.}
<ACTION>__{She reaches over and touches it.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Beautiful labrys.}
<ACTION>__{Corky is a bit suprised that she knows what it is.  She nods, rubbing it as if trying to hide it.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Are you surprised that I know what it is?}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Maybe.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I have a tattoo, would you like to see it?}
<ACTION>__{She moves closer, sliding over the leather cushions as she opens the front of her dress.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{A woman in upstate New York did it for me.}
<ACTION>__{She is not wearing a bra.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Here.  Do you like it?}
<ACTION>__{Set against the soft white skin of her breast is a bright green-stemmed violet.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It took her all day to do it.  She promised me it wouldn't hurt, but it was sore for a long time after.  I couldn't even touch it.}
<ACTION>__{Corky looks up from Violet's breast to her dark eyes.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But now I love the way it feels.}
<ACTION>__{She runs her fingers softly over the slightly scarred skin.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Here, touch it.}
<ACTION>__{Corky feels the blood pounding in her ears as Violet takes her hand and places it on her breast.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What are you doing?}
<ACTION>__{Violet looks at her.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why?}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Because I want to.  I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.}
<ACTION>__{Corky watches her, trying to figure her out even as her thumb presses into Violet's nipple. Inhaling sharply, Violet closes her eyes; she can feel Corky staring at her.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You don't believe me.  But I can prove it to you.}
<ACTION>__{She takes Corky's wrist and begins pulling her hand down her body.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You can't believe me because of what you see ...}
<ACTION>__{She forces Corky's hand between her legs, up under her dress.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But you can believe what you feel.}
<ACTION>__{Violet opens her eyes, a wanton smile on her lips.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You see ...  I've been thinking about you all day.}
<ACTION>__{Corky's forearm flexes and Violet moans. With both hands, Violet takes hold of Corky's forearm.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You planned this whole thing?}
<ACTION>__{Violet's head swims; she is unable to breathe.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{If I say yes, will you take your hand away?}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{...  yes.}
<ACTION>__{Now it is Corky who smiles. Violet shivers, her thighs rubbing, her hips thrusting against Corky's hand.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Please, Corky ...  please ...}
<ACTION>__{Her eyes barely open.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{...  kiss me.}
<ACTION>__{In a single motion, Corky takes hold of the back of her neck and covers Violet's open mouth with her own. With her hand still stuffed between Violet's legs, Corky lays her back onto the couch as the kiss becomes more -- More desperate, more hungry until -- We hear the front door unlock and open.}
<CHAR>__{CAESAR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Violet?}
<ACTION>__{Violet's eyes pop open and she pushes Corky back.}
<CHAR>__{CAESAR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Violet, you home?}
<ACTION>__{They scramble to compose themselves.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah.  In here, C.}
<ACTION>__{He comes around the corner and in the dim light sees the two figures sitting close on the couch.}
<CHAR>__{CAESAR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What's this?}
<ACTION>__{He mistakes Corky for a man.}
<CHAR>__{CAESAR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What the fuck is this?}
<ACTION>__{Violet stands as Caesar barrels toward the couch.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I didn't expect --}
<CHAR>__{CAESAR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What the fuck is going on?}
<ACTION>__{Corky stands and turns, Caesar suddenly realizing that she is a woman.}
<CHAR>__{CAESAR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, shit ...}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.}
<CHAR>__{CAESAR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ... it's fucking dark in here.}
<ACTION>__{He reaches to the wall for the lights.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{She is working for Bianchinni.}
<ACTION>__{Caesar extends his hand.}
<CHAR>__{CAESAR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, right, right.  Don mentioned that to me.  Hi, welcome to the family.}
<ACTION>__{Corky shakes his hand.}
<CHAR>__{CAESAR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're helping Rajeev?}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.  Rajeev's in India.}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{She's doing the work herself.}
<CHAR>__{CAESAR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really.}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's what Violet said.}
<ACTION>__{He looks at her as if he knows something.}
<CHAR>__{CAESAR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So, you just got out?}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Jesus, Caesar!}
<CHAR>__{CAESAR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What?  It ain't no big fuckin' deal. I know who Don hires.  Did you know he did time himself?}
<ACTION>__{Corky shakes her head.}
<CHAR>__{CAESAR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thirteen fucking years.  See, there ain't no secrets here.}
<ACTION>__{Corky doesn't like this man.}
<CHAR>__{CAESAR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How many'd you do?}
<CHAR>__{CORKY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Five.}
<ACTION>__{He whistles.}
<CHAR>__{CAESAR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not bad.  What for?}
<CHAR>__{VIOLET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
