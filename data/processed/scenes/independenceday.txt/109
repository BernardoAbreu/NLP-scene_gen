<A>__{we see the long highway leading to washington, the space ship hovering above it. one side of the freeway is packed solid, the other completely empty, save for one car...}
<L>__{interior moishe's olds night}
<A>__{moishe looks to the other side of the freeway, jam packed. on his side, they are the only car for miles.}
<C>__{moishe}
<D>__{the whole world is trying to get out of washington and we're the only schmucks trying to get in.}
<A>__{as moishe drives, david distracts him as he unpacks his backpack unloading his laptop. he grabs a cd.}
<C>__{moishe }
<D>__{what the hell is that?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{this, pops, is every phone book in america.}
<C>__{moishe}
<D>__{you think an important person like constance is going to be listed?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{she always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...}
<A>__{david starts to look it up. suddenly...}
<B>__{dozens of cars heading straight for them}
<A>__{in the attempt to get out, hundreds of cars have been re directed by the military to use the opposite side of the highway.}
<C>__{moishe}
<D>__{oh my god!}
<A>__{moishe swerves violently to avoid collision, barely missing the oncoming traffic. dodging right to left, moishe hangs on for dear life. a military office, assisting in diverting the cars turns just in time to see the olds whiz by. david and moishe are bounded around the inside of the car as moishe tries to veer through traffic. suddenly a truck blocks off their only escape route. moishe turns hard and drives up onto the right shoulder. overhead angle olds and traffic the olds is the only car in headed that direction. using the shoulder, swerving to miss barricades, they drives off an exit ramp.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{nice driving, pops!}
<A>__{dangerously close to a heart attack, moishe is, for once, at a loss for words. over their adrenaline pumped faces...}
