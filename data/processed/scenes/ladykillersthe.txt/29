<L>__{interior munson house kitchen day}
<A>__{mrs. munson has stuffed the paper enclosed bill into an envelope, which she is now laboriously addressing to bob jones university.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{and the choir was all in good voice. mm mm }
<A>__{there is a knock at the door.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{...who could that }
<A>__{the cat yowls and hisses. i e. munson house foyer day as mrs. munson swings open the door. g.h. dorr stands on the stoop mournfully dry washing his hands and obsequiously ducking his head.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{my dear mrs. munson, i do so hope this is not an inopportune time for our first practice }
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{somebody die?}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{i beg your oh!}
<A>__{he looks back at the long black vintage lincoln hearse parked at the curb behind him.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...no no, no bereavement, though it is so kind of you to enquire. no, the hearse is simply a vehicle commodious enough to accommodate all of the members of our ensemble. and of course our instruments, contrived in an age ignorant of miniaturization...}
<A>__{he turns and gestures at the vehicle. at his sign, gawain, the custodian, emerges from the driver's side. clark pancake emerges from the front passenger side. the general, wearing a different but equally pressed khaki suit and ascot, and with a smoking cigarette in his lips, emerges from a back door. gawain goes to the back of the hearse and opens its hatch to let out lump hudson, the football player. lump helps unload five large and oddly shaped instrument cases, each man taking one except for lump himself, who carries two. as the parade of losers and misfits winds its way up the walk:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...let me introduce you to my friends, my colleagues, these devoted and passionate musicians... this is gawain macsam, our bassoonist...}
<A>__{gawain nods as he passes by.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...general nguyen pham doc, viola da gamba...}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{no smoking in this house.}
<A>__{the general tosses his cigarette away and bows stiffly as he passes.}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{so sorry.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...clark pancake a multi instrumentalist, but with his remarkable embosser clark specializes in wind instruments, and is especially accomplished on the french horn...}
<A>__{he nods, passes.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...and, finally, aloysius "lump" hudson. lump is our sackbuttist and thank you, lump i see you've also brought my fiddle...}
<A>__{as he hands dorr the violin case:}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{here's your fiddle, doctor.}
<A>__{mrs. munson sizes up the group.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{you ain't gonna make a racket, are ya?}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{oh no. oh no no no no no. no, we shall recuse ourselves to the basement where we shall be i think here the expression is uniquely appropriate...}
<A>__{he gives a sickly smile.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...as quiet as the crypt.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{hmph.}
