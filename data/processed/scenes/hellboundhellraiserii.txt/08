<A>__{the scream continues, but the blackness is replaced by kirsty's anguished face; it is she who is screaming. the scream subsides, replaced by breathless panting accompanied by rapid eye movement.}

<P>__{(off camera)}
<D>__{ah, you're awake. good.}
<A>__{we pull out to see that kirsty is sitting up, fully dressed, on a hospital bed. ronson, a police detective, sits on a plain wooden chair, which is the only other piece of furniture in the room. the walls are bare save for a piece of primitive art on one wall, and, on another, a circular barred window looking out. ronson stands up and walks to the foot of the bed. he rests his hand on the bed's metal frame and smiles a perfunctory smile.}
<C>__{ronson}
<D>__{tell you what we'll make a deal. i will tell you what i know, then you tell me what you know. o.k.?}
<A>__{kirsty is still re orienting herself. she blinks a few times and then focuses on ronson's hands gripping the bed.}
<C>__{ronson}
<D>__{o.k.?}
<A>__{kirsty looks up at ronson's face and then around at the room.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{where am i?}
<C>__{ronson}

<D>__{what was it, kid? smack? angel dust? don't tell me acid's back in fashion?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{what are you talking about? who are you?}
<C>__{ronson}
<D>__{oh, excuse me...}
<A>__{ronson reaches in his jacket and flashes an i.d.}
<C>__{ronson}
