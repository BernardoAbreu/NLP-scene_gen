<L>__{interior melvin's apartment bedroom night}
<A>__{melvin is in his bedroom everything he's taking neatly stacked on the bed waiting to be packed (he is taking a camera). he has a list of what he needs. all items underwear, socks, etc... with four checks next to each one and still he checks each stack on the bed and adds another check. the phone rings. this is an amazing development. he has almost no recent experience with receiving a nighttime phone call. he makes a little comment to himself as he moves.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{woo woo.}
<A>__{he stops briefly trying to remember where the phone is and then, remembering, crosses and picks it up but before bringing it to his mouth nervously clears his throat.}
