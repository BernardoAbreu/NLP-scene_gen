<L>__{interior driving range late day}
<A>__{tin cup holds court.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{takes about two ounces of brains to figure it out. anyone think they got a brain with two ounces of brains in it?}
<A>__{the regulars silently look at each other, reluctant to reveal the heft of their brains.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{for chrissakes, boys! a little self confidence from the players' gallery. we ain't talking long division.}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(timidly)}
<D>__{how much we gotta lose?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{you want to liven things up, earl? that's a hell of an idea. say everyone puts in twenty bucks and the pot goes to whoever solves the riddle.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{you going to get the riddle, tin cup?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<P>__{(patiently)}
<D>__{dewey. i'm the one asking the riddle. i already know the answer. i don't getta guess. although... we could say if i get to five hundred bounces and no one gets the riddle, i get the pot. and i know what you're thinking. it's an impossible riddle. well, it's not. it's an easy riddle. and if somehow by the grace of fluke luck i win, and you all don't agree it was an easy riddle, hell, i will refund your money. earl, clint & all i'm in... we're in... count us in... etc...}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{okay, a man's driving down the road with his son and they get in a crash. two ambulances come and take the man and his son to different hospitals. son goes into the operating room, the doctor looks at him and says, 'i can't operate on this boy. he's my son.' how's that possible?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the clock's ticking boys...}
<A>__{tin cup begins bouncing a ball on the face of his wedge.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{father didn't sneak back in, right? he's still at the other hospital?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{it ain't 'star trek,' earl. no one beamed him aboard.}
<A>__{that eliminates the most plausible theory in their minds. the men think harder.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{well... if the father married the son's daughter }
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{it's a family riddle, earl. think clean thoughts.}
<A>__{the regulars puzzle some more.}
<C>__{clint}
<D>__{give us a little hinterior}
<C>__{molly }
<D>__{the doctor's a woman.}
<A>__{all heads turn to take in the arrival of:}
<B>__{molly griswold}
<A>__{standing just inside the door she's a fresh faced beauty in her early thirties, and she's got all new everything the sport of golf requires: new bag, new clubs, new shoes, new clothes, new visor... she looks like she stepped out of an ad in golf digest. and all the men are asking themselves the same question: what's she doing here? the silence invites molly to supply the riddle's answer.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{the doctor is the son's mother. feminists pose the riddle to reveal how deeply our sexual stereotypes run.}
<P>__{(directly to tin cup)}
<D>__{i take it you're a feminist?}
<A>__{tin cup misses the ball he's been bouncing, breaking the spell. the regulars wait for tin cup's response.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{ma'am, i've been called a lot of things but no one's ever saddled me with that one.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{you might try being saddled sometime the smell of leather, the sting of a whip...}
<A>__{the regulars snicker, enjoying her one upmanship.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<P>__{(slightly taken aback)}
<D>__{i'm just a humble golf pro...}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{you're roy mcavoy the golf pro? i pictured something... different. i have a seven o'clock lesson.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i thought i had a doctor griswold at seven.}
<A>__{they hurry out to the range, tin cup oblivious to his gaffe. and the regulars gather to look out the window their pov through window to the range, where molly is stretching and tin cup is discreetly waving to the regulars to get lost.}
