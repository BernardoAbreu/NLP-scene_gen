<L>__{int: brotherhood building, augustus' office continuing}
<A>__{we are in a beautifully ornate office. it is like a private chapel. we see silus enter. he is grim. augustus is kneeling in prayer. he senses silus.}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{the infection is spreading. each day he shares his blood with more of them. even though they are locked in their homes.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{he is somewhere in the quarantine zone. i will find him.}
<A>__{augustus turns to silus. augustus moves closer to him, stares into silus' strange, pale eyes.}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{clear. so very clear your eyes. the way they were when you were born. there will be no search.}
<A>__{augustus moves off to his desk. silus is shocked.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{no search?}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{the queen has instructed the government to evacuate the city around the quarantine zone. in another day they will take action.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{what kind of action?}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{eradication. of everything within the area. they will burn it all. including edgar.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{and the innocents there, who are not infected?}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{it is a necessary step. we cannot let this escape.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{augustus looks up at silus; this is perhaps the first time silus has refused anything that augustus has decreed.}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{is it the policewoman? is this affecting your thinking? there is no love for our kind silus. only service.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{we have done this. released this thing into the world. we have betrayed their trust in us, more than once. i won't do it again.}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{there is no debate. they will be sacrificed, so the rest will be pure.}
<A>__{silus shakes his head.}
<C>__{augustus}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{this policeman, jones. he talked to the press. told them this came from edgar.}
<A>__{silus watches augustus very carefully.}
<C>__{augustus}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{there are members of the inner circle who question the way you have handled this. blame you for this man's actions. i have made it clear that you will fix this. that you will silence him.}
<A>__{augustus moves close to silus now. gently touches his face.}
<C>__{augustus}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{these are hard things we do. but you must think of the greater good. and of your own future.}
<A>__{cut to a light bulb flickering.}
