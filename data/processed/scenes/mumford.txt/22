<L>__{interior mumford's apartment magic}
<A>__{mumford comes in and puts the bags down on the kitchen counter. he goes directly to the table by his main chair and picks up the tv remote. he switches it on and changes the channel. the opening segment of unsolved mysteries is just beginning. it previews the stories on that evening's episode disappearances and unclosed cases with robert stack hosting. close on mumford's face as he watches. only when the whole show has been previewed does he seem to relax. he leaves the show on as he goes into the kitchen and begins unloading the bags.}
