<A>__{the laddermen look confused seeing brian sitting among them. a car suddenly cuts the truck company off. the driver slams the brakes, pushing the truck company into a horrible skid. the back fishtails, the wheels jump the curb, bash a mailbox, and then the whole rig rolls onto its side and drags to a stop. it's tangled confusion in the rear cab. firemen, unhurt, piled atop one another. brian slides his way out from under them and looks down the street where plumes of smoke rise six blocks away. he starts running.}
