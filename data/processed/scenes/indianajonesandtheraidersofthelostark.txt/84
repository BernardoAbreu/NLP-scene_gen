<L>__{exterior between two tents day}
<A>__{indy hustles between the tents. up ahead, two german officers stop to talk, blocking his exit. he moves along the side of one of the tents until he finds an opening and slips inside.}
<L>__{interior the tent}
<A>__{indy finds himself in a tent set up for rather comfortable living. he has just started to cross it when he hears a loud, excited grunting. he turns toward the sound. in the corner, tied to a chair and gagged is marion. indy rushes to her, snatches the gag from her mouth and embraces her. they kiss, deep and long.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i though you were dead.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{they were throwing me around like a rag doll.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{they must have switched baskets. thank god for that! bless those bastards. have they hurt you?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{no. not since i got here. they just asked about you what you knew. the frenchman's got the hot's for me. i've been playing that along. oh, indy, get me out of here.}
<A>__{indy pulls out a knife and then stops suddenly, thinking.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(putting the knife away)}
<D>__{i have to leave you here for a little while. i know where the ark is. if i take you out of here they'll start combing the place for us.}
<C>__{marion}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{cut me loose!}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{keep your voice down.}
<C>__{marion}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{i said get me out of }
<A>__{indy pops the gag back in her mouth. her eyes widen in fury and she grunts obscenities at him.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{look, you don't know how glad i am to see you. and i don't like doing this. but the whole thing will be shot if you don't just sit here quietly. they haven't hurt you in the last twenty four hours, they aren't going to start now. i will be back to get you in no time.}
<A>__{he kisses her forehead, jumps up and hurries out of the tent.}
