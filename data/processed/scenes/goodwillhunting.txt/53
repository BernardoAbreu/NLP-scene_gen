<L>__{interior will's apartment night}
<A>__{will sits alone in his one room apartment, reading. a closer look reveals he is reading a self help psychology book. will is flipping through the book at about a page per second. he shakes his head and smiles. upon finishing the book, he throws it in a nearby wastebasket. push in on the back of the book where a smiling psychologist is pictured.}
<L>__{interior psychologist's office continuous}
<A>__{will sits in a well decorated psychologist's office. across from will sits the same psychologist, henry lipkin (40), from the book. they are in mid session.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that's why i love stock car racin'. that dale ernhart's real good.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{now you know will, and i know, what you need to be doing. you have a gift.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i could work the pit maybe, but i could never drive like dale ernhart }
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{you have a quality something you were born with, that you have no control over and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. and i'm not saying that's wrong. i'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. he's been to my house for dinner. as a matter of fact i did some free consultation for "mike" that's not his real name. that's in my book.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{yeah, i read your book. "mike" had the same problems as "chad" the stockbroker.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{yes. the pressures you feel, and again, i am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential you're in a rut. so stop the tom foolery the shenanigan's, will.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you're right. i know.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{will, your not getting off that easy.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{no, but, i mean you know... i do other things. that no one knows about.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{like what, will?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i go places, i interact.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{what places?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{certain, clubs.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{like, paradise. it's not bad.}
<A>__{will gives the psychologist a furtive look.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{it's just that feeling when you can take your shirt off and really dance.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{when the music owns you. do you understand?}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{i might understand that.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{c'mon, i read your book. i talked to you. it's just something i know to be true.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{that's very presumptuous.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<P>__{(a little laugh)}
<D>__{well, i'm sorry to disappoint you, but i'm married and i have two children.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i'm sure you do. you probably got a real nice house, nice car your book's a best seller.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{you're getting defensive, will.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{look, man. i don't care if you're putting from the rough. there are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; alexander the great, caesar, shakespeare, oscar wilde, napoleon, gertrude stein, not to mention danny terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{who is "danny terrio?"}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{if you wanna hit "ramrod," take your shot. take some pride in it. you go to church? so fuckin' what, god loves you. i mean, christ. a guy as well known as you? by the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house sunday nights you probably look like "inspector clouseau."}
<A>__{the psychologist calmly packs his things.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{well, i can see this is pointless...}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you're getting defensive... henry. and hey, chief tell the wife, at least. christ, set her free.}
<A>__{the shrink gets up and walks out.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{fuckin' hypocrite...}
