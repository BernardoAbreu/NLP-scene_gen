<L>__{interior wheeler hallway day.}
<A>__{now we're moving behind april as she moves through the silent house. she carries a basket of dirty laundry on her hip. she pulls the bedding off the couch. the distant sound of children playing.}
<C>__{mrs. givings }
<D>__{yoo hoo!}
<A>__{she turns to see mrs. givings at the screen door. april manages a friendly smile.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{hi helen.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{i can't stay a minute... my, don't you look comfy! i just wanted to bring this sedum for that messy patch in the front yard.}
<A>__{she puts it on the table.}
<C>__{mrs. givings }
<D>__{all it wants is just a tiny dollop of water for the first few days, and you'll find it absolutely thrives.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{well, thank you... you want some coffee?}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{only if you're having some.}
<A>__{helen sits down. with the end of her finger, she pushes a dirty dish out of her way.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{is there something i can do for you, helen?}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{oh... yes, i almost forgot. i do have a small favor i'd like to ask...}
<P>__{(quiver of anxiety )}
<D>__{it's about my son, john. he's been in the hospital.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{i'm sorry to hear that.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{well, actually, just for the present, he's in pleasant brook... psychiatric.}
<A>__{april's face. she knows what it means.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{...i'm so sorry.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{oh... nothing serious. he just got a little run down. things can just get the better of us sometimes. don't you think?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{yes. of course.}
<A>__{mrs. givings smiles. then, pretending to read the titles on a stack of books on the table...}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{it really is a marvellous facility and the treatments seem to be doing him wonders... anyway, they said getting out for an afternoon might do him some good.}
<A>__{she pauses on sartre's `nausea', looks at it vaguely.}
<C>__{mrs. givings }
<D>__{i think he finds my friends a little conventional, frankly. i mean, he's travelled. he has a phd in mathematics. i suppose you could say he's an intellectual. it would do him a world of good to meet a young couple like you.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{we'd love to helen.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{so, i thought perhaps if you had some time...}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{we'd love to.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<P>__{(flushed with relief)}
<D>__{thank you, dear... thank you.}
<A>__{april smiles generously.}
<C>__{mrs. givings }
<D>__{i remember when you first came off the train. you weren't like most of my clients. you were different, somehow.}
<A>__{april's face. she's listening.}
<C>__{mrs. givings }
<D>__{well, you looked simply ravishing and i just knew frank did something terribly brilliant in town. you just seemed... special... of course you still are.}
<A>__{april takes this in.}
