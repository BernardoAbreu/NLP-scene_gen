<L>__{int lab level "a" timeless}
<A>__{...water! chris kicks, paddles with his rifle, righting himself, getting his bearings. he's in a huge aquarium that's built into one of the laboratory's walls... and he's not alone. there are six sharks in the tank. zombie sharks, their flesh rotting, leaking pus. the largest of them snaps at chris, but its jaws catch only a clump of his swirling hair. chris kicks with his feet, remaining upright, and fires his wet winchester. the bullet wimps out, restrained by the water. it penetrates the shark, but barely. we can see the casing lodged in the animal's flesh. chris gets an idea. he kicks forward. plants the barrel of his winchester directly against the aquarium glass... only to find himself aiming directly at... ...jill, who is aiming back at him with her m 16. they're both stunned. they stare at each other for a moment, like gunfighters, until... ...another shark circles in for an attack. chris swings the winchester away from jill and fires underwater. the aquarium glass cracks... but holds.}
<C>__{jill }
<D>__{hang on! we're gonna get wet!}
<A>__{jill fires. more cracks, but the glass is resistant. chris out. water surges into the lab, knocking wesker and some of his squad down. they stand up again, only to find themselves knee high in a dark pool...with shark fins slicing the surface. everybody opens fire. the dead fish keep coming.}
<C>__{aiken}
<D>__{where the fuck is a shark's brain?}
<C>__{sullivan}
<D>__{in it's head! i swear, aiken, you would be better off dead.}
<A>__{in a bizarre frenzy, the sharks kick their tails, making startlingly quick turns, darting every which way, snapping at the scent of warm flesh. the troopers, hampered by the water, splash around wildly, many of them nearly getting bitten. the air above thickens with a fog of graphite from ten spitting automatics. the water gets darker as it becomes clouded with blood. but thankfully, the level is dropping. the water is seeping out through grates in the floor. the sharks become more visible, moving slower as their bellies scrape the floor. the troopers pick them off, one by one. the immediate threat passes...but as the water drains away, the troopers become aware of... a klaxon like sound. another alarm. the entry door glides shut with a booommm!}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{nice. very nice, valentine! you set off a containment breach!}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{it must have been the water. god, the water! (she turns to chris} did you swallow any?}
<C>__{speyer}
<D>__{i did.}
<C>__{sullivan}
<D>__{a bunch of us did, man.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{separate systems. salt water. no germs. but.. .it breached!}
<A>__{wesker, looking crazed, his sunglasses gone, is typing on his "game boy"... getting no response.}
<C>__{wesker }
<D>__{we can go in deeper. but we can't get out. not with my card key.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{so...we live here now.}
<A>__{rosie finds sullivan looking at her curiously.}
<D>__{rodriguez (cont.} landlords. shit hills. kicked my family out of six apartments. i got use to sayin'...'so...we live here now'.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{there are override exits... but i can't find them without this!}
<A>__{wesker flings his "game boy" angrily against a wall. it shatters into bits.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{that was a smart move.}
<A>__{wesker bristles. he's about to confront chris, but he spots his sunglasses where they were deposited on a floor grate by the water. he walks over and picks them up, wiping the lenses on his shirt. without looking at chris, he asks...}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{and... you are?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{nobody. just a...a local guy...}
<A>__{chris spots a dry lab coat hanging on a wall hook. he takes it down and uses it to dry his rifle.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{...who gets pissed off when he finds... his farm animals... and his father's oldest friend... dead. and the only woman he ever cared about turns out to be a goddam metal head!}
<A>__{wesker, while seeming to understand, still doesn't look up.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{valentine...who is this asshole?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{his name is chris redfield. he was... part of my cover, sir.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{cover?}
<A>__{a snappy argument develops, a lover's quarrel, with higher than normal stakes.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{this is not the time to mouth off, chris! you're in deep shit here!}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{why didn't you let me in on this?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{why did you have to come after me? how did you get in here, anyway?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i used to play here, when this was a fucking laundry room! and what makes you think i came after you?}
<C>__{barry}
<P>__{(interrupting) whoa! look here.}
<A>__{barry is stooped over the faceless zombie that wesker shot. he rips an i.d. badge from the corpse's coat. he tosses it to wesker, who reads the i.d... "dr. j. marcus"}
<C>__{barry }
<D>__{is this the pile of shit we're supposed to bring out of here?}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{it...it once was.}
<C>__{vickers }
<D>__{i got something here.}
<A>__{brad has been quietly working at one of the lab's computers. barry rushes over and looks at the monitor screen.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{a map. same as on your gizmo. exits marked...blue and green.}
<A>__{wesker steps in for a look.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{the greens are the overrides. (to brad) can you print this out?}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{i can try.}
<A>__{chris calmly retrieves his wet shoulder bag from the floor. he wrings out the cloth and, using the lab coat, wipes the bullets dry.}
<C>__{vickers }
<P>__{(off the screen) we're on level 'a'.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{we have to get down to level 'd'.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{hold on. marcus is dead. if this mission was about bringin' him out, we're outta here, right?}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{i wish we were, but no. we have a potential outbreak here. we might be the only ones who can stop it.}
<C>__{speyer}
<D>__{stop it? how?}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{there's... an antidote.}
<A>__{everyone's ears perk.}
<C>__{wesker }
<D>__{we can't bring marcus out, but we can bring out the serum. maybe somebody...can analyze it... and figure how to beat the virus.}
<A>__{jill looks at chris. catches him weighing options.}
<C>__{jill}
<P>__{(privately) not simple.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(privately) not complicated, either.}
<D>__{we only have to decide... what's right... and what's wrong.}
<C>__{jill}
<P>__{(privately) i forgot. you're never}
<D>__{confused. so...what's right, mohawk? and what's wrong?}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{shit. (at the computer) there are no green exits on this level. why... why would that be?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{they don't want anybody up here to go snoopin' ...upstairs or down.}
<A>__{wesker looks at chris with that odd, confident smile.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{pretty good guess. you must have been in the military, son.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{native american. exempted.}
<C>__{vickers}
<P>__{(typing, starting to panic) fuck!}
<D>__{there... there's no way out!}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{yes there is.}
<A>__{chris points at the broken grid above the shattered aquarium. wesker looks up. then looks back at chris.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{not a bad idea. (turning to vickers) see if you can call up... service charts, schematics.}
<A>__{brad's fingers fly. he scrolls through menus.}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{got it. ceiling grids, ladders. the whole infrastructure.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{print it. print all of it.}
<A>__{the young man types a command. wesker rushes over to the h. p. and grabs the first chart that rolls out. rebecca steps over to brad. she points at his leg. seated at the computer, his trousers hiked, blood can be seen on his sock, just above his boot.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{what's that from?}
<C>__{vickers}
<P>__{(nervous) i...snagged it. on the}
<D>__{desk. when we were scrambling.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{lemme look at it.}
<C>__{vickers}
<P>__{(adamant) no. it's just a scratch!}
<A>__{chris watches wesker as he studies the printed charts.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{there's a... part of an old laundry chute. it might not show on there. it runs up to the kitchen.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{i'm not going up. i'm going down.}
<A>__{wesker, grim faced, looks at his team.}
<C>__{wesker }
<D>__{i'd like to let you guys off the hook. but i can't. i need back up. you're comin' with me. any objections?}
<A>__{the troopers exchange glances. jill is first to speak.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{no objections. we'll back you up.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(disappointed) you said... people}
<D>__{wind you up and you do whatever they want you to do.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{stay out of this, son. you're the only one who doesn't have a choice in this. there's no place to lock you up. i can't let you go, you're a security risk. i could shoot you. legally. but your lady friend would probably get all over my ass. so... i'm afraid you're comin' with us... whether you like it or not. (to jill, pointedly) he's your responsibility, valentine. see that he doesn't make trouble.}
<A>__{jill looks at chris.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{you up to the challenge?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{try me.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(snappy) i already have.}
