<L>__{interior record label morning}
<A>__{pete enters and walks into ronnie's office. ronnie is drawing on a blackboard behind his desk.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm drawing the album cover for van halen's diver down.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{if you spent a little bit more time focusing on graham parker instead of drawing album covers, i wouldn't be in this predicament.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm focused on graham parker.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you're supposed to help me with him!}
<C>__{pete }
<D>__{you're supposed to call the companies, you're supposed to get people to the show!}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i've done everything i can, pete. you had me pushing around a corpse. it was like being in fucking weekend at graham's.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{what should we do? i'm out of ideas.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you fly in the rumour. i can't sell a reunion concert without the band. it's ridiculous.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{with what? i can't afford it.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you put this on yourself. you wanted the responsibility, take it on the chin, and stop acting like a bitch.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{what did you call me?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{chin.}
<A>__{pete walks out of ronnie's office and into the main office space. ronnie follows.}
<C>__{ronnie }
<D>__{pete wait. i have an apartment, i have health insurance, i have car payments. i have responsibilities.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{don't talk to me about responsibilities. i have a life. i have a family. i can't afford to sit in my apartment getting high, jerking off, and then going to tommy's chili burgers at three in the morning.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{that's not even the order that happens in!}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i have everything to lose here. everything.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yes. because you spent thousands of dollars on shit we don't need. you really need to spend thirty thousand dollars on a fucking neon sign, dude? which is inside? it's not even outside. we know where we work.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{if you want to sign a band, you have to look like you're the real deal.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(to cat)}
<D>__{princess labia, how much is it to fly the rumour in?}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{it's twelve thousand.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{twelve thousand dollars!}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you know what? fine. fly in the rumour. put it on my amex.}
