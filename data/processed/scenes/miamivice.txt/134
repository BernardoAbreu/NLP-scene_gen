<A>__{enters. she touches his back. he turns to her with a smile.}
<C>__{crockett}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{let's talk deliveries.}
<A>__{isabella is not let down by the switch to commerce. she merely goes there, too. after all, this is their subject. soft smiles.}
<C>__{crockett }
<D>__{...and a different kind of deal.}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{like...?}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{like "three thousand a ki?" that's nice. and i can supply the transportation into south florida and the gulf, more reliable and on time than fedex. but, three per ki was ok for openers.}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{and why should continuing excellence cost more?}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{cost less. that's the pointerior}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{is it december?}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{did christmas come early this year...?}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{better than that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we become partners. only in this territory and only on loads we run. and you don't pay us three thousand a ki. you pay us zero. why we get is thirty percent of the load. product or cash. "and why," you're thinking, "would i be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? is he chipping? crazy for my love? too many mojitas?" and the answer is, "of course" but also "no. it is because sonny can deliver what no one else can."}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{good samba dancing...?}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{zero risk.}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{'cause you don't lose loads?}
<C>__{crockett}

<C>__{isabella }
<P>__{(deadly seriously)}
<D>__{what if i tell you that your ideas are too big for your skin?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that merely to propose this is a dangerous thing?}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{then i would say to you, this has been fun...}
<A>__{there's a long pause. this is business. this is what is.}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{the range should be between fifteen and seventeen point five percent of the p.o.e....to even consider it.}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{i need thirty. calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{available cash is not an issue for us...}

<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{maybe i'm only one.}
<A>__{and she slides into his arms. and smiles...}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{we'll do it at twenty two...}
<A>__{isabella laughs. she kisses him under the shower water. and it's tough to know who is pushing it further out onto the edge.}
<C>__{crockett }
<D>__{...and now what?}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{and now i make you breakfast again...}
<A>__{her breathing is heavier as she buries her head in his neck.}
