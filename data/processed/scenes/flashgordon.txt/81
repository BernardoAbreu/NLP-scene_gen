<D>__{it's the risk i ask, barin hide him for me in arboria.}
<C>__{barin}

<C>__{barin}
<D>__{snake keeper! rouse your beast!}
<A>__{angle snake keeper a halfwit tree man, drowsing against another part of the parapet, he jerks awake, shuffles across to a big wicker basket, pulls off the lid. a hideous eel like serpant rears it's head, hissing and snapping venemously. the keeper sticks his arm down. the snake coils around it. with a drooling grin, the keeper withdraws it. cu flash watching with horrified revulsion.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{keeper carries the hissing snapping snake toward an enormous stump of a tree trunk. he holds his arm out over it, whistles a curious note. the snake leaps off the arm and vanishes into the hollowed out trunk. we notice now that there are six holes drilled into the gnarled wood.}
<C>__{barin }
<D>__{who dares the beast?}
<A>__{a battle scarred old tree man steps forward. without a word, he goes to the stump and plunges a hand into one of the holes.}
<B>__{inside the stump}
<A>__{big cu snake with a hiss, fangs strike a wrist.}
