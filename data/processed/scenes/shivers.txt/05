<L>__{interior annabelle's apartment morning}
<A>__{hobbes ties a green surgical mask over his mouth and nose, snaps on rubber gloves. he turns to annabelle's corpse on the dining room table, legs hanging over the edge, now naked the private girls' school clothes in a heap on the floor. hobbes takes a scalpel from the top of the radiator where he has laid out his surgical instruments. he feels annabelle's stomach until he has found what he wants, then cuts her open with one smooth, confident stroke of the scalpel. he then quickly douses the inside of her abdomen with some clear fluid in a squeeze bottle, lights a wooden match, and drops it into her abdominal cavity. the corpse bursts into flame. hobbes steps back to watch. tears spring into his eyes. he picks up another scalpel and perfunctorily sticks it into his neck. blood spurts into his mask and soaks through to the other side. hobbes sinks to his knees before the blazing corpse and struggles to draw the scalpel through the tendons of his neck.}
