<L>__{interior precinct house, hallway night}
<A>__{somerset and mills come from the print lab. a janitor is mopping the hall. the computer is heard whirring and clicking onwards. somerset sits with a groan on a couch outside the door. mills flops beside him.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{you really meant what you said to mrs. gold. you really believe we'll get him, don't you?}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{and you don't?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i wish i still thought like you. i'm so far gone from that.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{so, tell me what you think we're doing.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{all we do is pick up the pieces. we take all the evidence... all the pictures, statements. write everything down and note what time things happened. we take it all, make a nice, neat pile and file it away. just in case it's ever needed in a courtroom.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{you're unbelievable. in my entire life, you're the oldest man i've ever met.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i've seen even the most promising clues lead to dead ends. hundreds of times.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i've seen the same. i'm not the country hick boy you seem to think i am.}
<A>__{somerset takes out a cigarette and lights it.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{in this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... if every un revenged corpse were to suddenly rise and walk again, there would be no more room for the living.}
<A>__{mills slumps back, crosses his arms, closes his eyes to sleep.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{don't try to tell me you didn't get that rush tonight... that adrenalin. like we were getting somewhere.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{and, don't try to tell me it was because you thought we found something that would play well in a courtroom.}
<A>__{somerset looks at mills, puffs the cigarette. the computer is heard: whir click whir click... insert title card}
