<L>__{interior mining museum (main street, town) day}
<A>__{vintage mining gear. walls covered with sepia tone photos chronicling the history of the mccormick mines. gladys lauderback (50s) sits at a desk. she blows smoke from her kool into the breeze of an air conditioner. ignoring the signs behind her head: "no smoking!", "danger gas!" as chris enters, gladys hides her lit cigarette in a drawer.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{did you pop him one?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{he had it comin'. but sam palmer... that woman abuses her power.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{why? because she stopped you from givin' wade another pop?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i'm not proud of it.}
<A>__{chris goes to a table and a map of the mines that honeycomb beneath the town. many of them are marked "explored." many aren't. chris checks another tunnel off the list. he sniffs the air and glares at gladys. smoke rises out of her desk drawer. gladys yanks it open and puts out the flame.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i thought you were trying the patch.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{i am.}
<A>__{she raises her sleeve to reveal several nicotine patches. chris exits through a door at the back of the museum.}
