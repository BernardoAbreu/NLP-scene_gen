<A>__{coraline races downstairs to the other living room where the little door home must be! but the living room is locked tight. she pulls at the handles, plants a foot and tries with all her might! it's no use. she stops, panting, then hears a piano note being hit over and over.}
<L>__{interior other father's study same}
<A>__{coraline opens the door and finds the other father sitting at the piano, his back to her, hitting the note. she speaks in her bravest voice.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{hey you! where's the other mother? i want to go home.}
<A>__{the other father turns around. he looks ill; his hair messed and his glasses askew. he speaks, his voice slowed down.}
<C>__{other father}
<D>__{all will be swell, soon as mother's refreshed. her strength is our strength.}
<A>__{the white gloved hands pop out from the piano. one covers his mouth, the other wags a finger in his face.}
<C>__{other father }
<D>__{mustn't talk when mother's not here.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{if you won't even talk to me, i'm gonna find the other wybie. he'll help me.}
<A>__{she turns to go.}
<C>__{other father}
<D>__{no point; he pulled a long face...}
<A>__{he pulls down the corners of his mouth impossibly far.}
<C>__{other father }
<D>__{...and mother didn't like it.}
<A>__{the piano hands pop out again, aggressively shut his mouth and spin him away from coraline. frightened, she runs to the door that leads outside, and pulls it open.}
