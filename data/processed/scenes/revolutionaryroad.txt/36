<A>__{frank stands at the mantle tying his tie.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well, i guess this wasn't what you had in mind when you went to work this morning?}
<A>__{maureen covers herself with the sheets.}
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{no. it certainly wasn't.}
<A>__{frank inspects the contents of the mantle: photos of maureen at the prom; maureen with her parents. maureen tentatively fingers her hair that has now gone to frizz. the sheet slips down. she grabs at it. then wills herself to calm down and act sophisticated.}
<C>__{maureen }
<D>__{do you have a cigarette, frank?}
<A>__{he turns and smiles at her.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{sure, here.}
<A>__{he comes over and gives her one. lights it with his zippo. she exhales, slowly gaining confidence. frank gets up and pulls on his jacket.}
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{can i get you a drink or anything?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no thanks, maureen. actually, i guess i'd better be cutting out, it's getting kind of late.}
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{gee, that's right. have you missed your train?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's all right, i will get the next one.}
<A>__{he comes over to her. bends down, kisses her gently on the lips.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{listen: you were swell. take care now.}
