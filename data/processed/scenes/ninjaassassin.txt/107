<L>__{exterior herbalist night}
<A>__{the sort of store where the owner lives above the shop. mika pounds on the door as a light comes on in the floor above. a moment later, the door opens.}
<C>__{herbalist}
<D>__{what is it? what }
<A>__{he steps out of the way as mika helps raizo in, bloody and half dead.}
<L>__{interior herbalist night continuous}
<A>__{herbalist places herbs into a hand grinder as raizo staggers through the rows of bowls, grabbing what he needs and handing it to her.}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{...dong xia leaves...three of the lo chan...dragon root...}
<C>__{herbalist}
<D>__{you should not mix these. very dangerous.}
<A>__{raizo ignores him. gives her some more dried bits and pieces. the herbalist shakes his head.}
<C>__{herbalist }
<D>__{if you are in pain...if you wish to die...there are other ways, this will be agony }
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{no...it will save me....}
<C>__{herbalist}
<D>__{it will? you're sure?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{let me write this down.}
<A>__{he goes to find a pen and paper as mika grinds away.}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{hot water.}
<A>__{she goes to a tea kettle, pours water into the bowl. he reaches for it, and nearly collapses. she helps him raise the cup to his lips. tilts it and watches him drink. takes the empty cup away from him. raizo shudders as the drugs course through him.}
<C>__{raizo }
<D>__{i have to sleep now...a day at least.}
<A>__{his eyelids flutter. she's holding him up now muscles already loosening.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{a day?!? what should i do?}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{...keep moving...}
<A>__{he slumps over the counter like a child dropping into deepest sleep as the herbalist comes back, pen and paper in hand. he pauses as he sees mika standing over raizo. she looks from him to raizo and back again, then:}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{i will have him to go.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{can you...help me to the car?}
