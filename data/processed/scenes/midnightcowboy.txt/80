<L>__{interior cass's bedroom day}
<A>__{joe turns away from a small terrace, buckling his belt, glancing off toward the sound of cass in the shower. he flicks the tv remote control, enjoying his power, ignoring the silent images on the screen battle casualties, a pretty girl recommending aspirin, a man's stomach flashing animated pain, starving war refugees, a dog eating pzazz flicking it off to concentrate on the costume jewelry and perfume bottles on cass's dressing table.}
<C>__{cass's voice}
<D>__{don't look, baby...}
<A>__{joe turns to look as cass comes from the bathroom, holding a towel around her as she runs behind the closet door.}

<A>__{a tower of black bugle beads emerges from the closet door.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{zip this thing, will you, tex?}
<A>__{joe zips her dress, follows her to the dressing table, where she sprays her hair with lacquer.}

<A>__{joe grins, relieved as she takes out a gold lame purse and opens it. he frowns as she folds; it upside down, empty.}
<C>__{cass }
<D>__{darn! i didn't get to the bank tex could you let me have a little coin for the taxi waxi?}
<A>__{joe stands mute as she cups his chin in her hand, seductively.}

<D>__{you're such a doll. i hate money, don't you? god, it's been fun.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{funny thing, you mentioning money. i was just about to ask your for some...}
<A>__{joe tries to laugh but it sticks in his throat as cass speaks an impassioned whisper still holding joe's chin.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{you bastard! you son of a bitch! you think you're dealing with some old slut? look at me! you think just cause you're a longhorn bull you can get away with this crap? well, you're out of your mind. i am a gorgeous chick, thirty one, that's right, you said it!}
<A>__{sobbing suddenly, she throws herself on the bed. joe stands bewildered by the vastness of her grief.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{hey. hey, cass. did you think i meant that? christ, would i be asking you for money with a wad like that riding on my hip?}
<A>__{joe waves his wallet at her, but she only cries louder. he hands her a kleenex. she clutches it to her face, wailing. joe leans over the bed, whispering in her ear:}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{hey. you are a gorgeous looking piece, cass. guy gets horny, just looking at you. it's a fact. how much you need for that taxi? ten? twenty? there you go.}
<A>__{joe tucks a twenty dollar bill into her bosom, tilts his stetson and starts out. cass blows her nose, looking after him. o.s. chorus sings, "from this valley they say you are going we will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile..."}
