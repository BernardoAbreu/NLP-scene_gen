<T>__{main title sequence:}
<A>__{a pair of elevator doors open. amy klein exits and walks towards camera. she's all in black, from her black sneakers and black stockings up to her tinted glasses and jet black hair. the only thing about her that isn't black is a complexion so translucently pale that it bespeaks only the most rare and grudging familiarity with daylight. she has a paper coffee cup and a cigarette in the same hand, and she alternates sips of coffee with puffs of her cigarette with a practiced proficiency. she ignores the unhappy looks of her fellow employees. she clearly has practice at this as well. little office cubbies scattered around a converted loft space. "too hip" employees sit at their desks, typing at computers, conferring at tables going about the business of turning out another issue. they point and whisper as amy walks by. amy passes another cubicle as a young reporter holds the newspaper's front page up in front of amy. a big headline reads, "how to be a crack whore" written over a photo of a crack den in which we glimpse things better left unseen. beneath the headline is written, "a special report by amy klein."}
<B>__{i}
<C>__{young reporter }
<D>__{nice reporting klein. how `bout you show me what you learned?}
<A>__{amy is already past him, she throws back a middle finger for a response.}
<C>__{young reporter }
<D>__{maybe later.}
<A>__{betty, 50ish, her glasses hanging on the tip of her nose, sees amy coming.}
<C>__{etty}
<D>__{hey, amy...}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{morning...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{morning? it's half past four.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{mmm...}
<A>__{betty gives a broad gesture over her shoulder, pointing toward the editor's office across the work space. amy heads across the way, toward the office. betty picks up the phone.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{mr. rickman... amy's here. right.}
<A>__{nt. charles rickman's office day charles rickman, the editor in chief, is an englishman in his early forties, sporting a pony tail which, like a moustache on a sixteen year old, only serves to emphasize his true age. he's fiddling around with some sort of tv vcr set up, and is looking away from the door as it opens and amy enters behind him.}
<C>__{charles}
<P>__{(without turning)}
<D>__{ah, i detect that unique and ubiquitous combination of female sweat and patchouli oil that signals the arrival of...}
<A>__{he turns toward a dour amy.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{...the delightful and world famous amy klein. have a seat, angel of light.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{eat me, charles.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{it's exactly that lack of respect for authority that got you fired from the new york post.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i wasn't fired. i was re assigned.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{of course. where would you be without me? by the way, i don't recall ever being thanked properly for this "re assignment".}
<A>__{charles makes air quotes with his fingers.}
<C>__{charles }
<D>__{lucky for you i opened my doors to you here as soon as i heard you were "available".}
<A>__{more air quotes. amy walks over to a "trophy table" where she looks over a cluster of framed photo's. she points to one of her and charles, smiling together. more innocent times for both.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i seem to recall a rather similar "reassignment" with you, charles.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{touche'. well, thanks to international conglomerates and the euro dollar i, along with mother england, am blessed with your acquaintance, yet again.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{hey a contract's a contract.}
<A>__{she holds up the cassette recorder.}
<C>__{amy }
<D>__{look, if all this about me being late with the crack whore story it's all right here and it's gold. i was just about to }
<C>__{charles}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{it's not about the crack whores, i'm sure you're working your usual unrestrained insightful magic on what i'm certain will be another eye opening expose. i expect nothing but brilliance in five thousand words or less.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but this is better.}
<A>__{amy spots an open container of chinese food on charles's desk. she inspects it, then picks something out of it with a pair of chop sticks.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{so what then? are we being sued again?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{hmm? oh no.}
<P>__{(sees her eating)}
<D>__{please feel free to have some of that.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{thanks. what is this? general tso's cat?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{spare me the "nothing comes close to new york chinese" speech just this once. go on, sit down. just something i wanted to show you...}
<A>__{he heads back over to the vcr. amy ditches the chinese food and picks up her coffee again. she sits, lights another cigarette.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{okay... rewind, rewind? rewind.}
<A>__{he finds the button, presses it and turns back to amy.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{somebody mailed us this thing around two weeks ago but, in keeping with our usual level of efficiency, betty didn't get around to opening it `til this morning. then she brought it to me.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{charles closes the door.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what's the matter? this x rated or something?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{something. amy, with your encyclopedic world wide knowledge of skank ology have you ever heard of "deaders?"}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{oh, sure. they're generally in their forties, kind of ex hippy types. they still think jerry garcia is like "really cool" even though he's dead.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{not dead heads... dead ers. d e a d e r s.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{you know, sometimes they wear ponytails. dream about how great the sixties were. you see `em in the park sometimes...}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{love of my life, go screw yourself. i'm asking you a serious question.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{no, charles. i've never heard of "deaders."}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{watch the tape.}
<A>__{charles goes to the vcr and hits the play button. amy finishes her coffee and lights a new cigarette with the still glowing butt of her last one. she leans forward.}
<B>__{on the tape}
<A>__{the image flickers into view. it's handheld, low rez, clearly been shot in some dingy apartment somewhere, decorated in a "mattresses on the floor beer spray on the walls" type decor. there are around half a dozen people there, in their twenties and younger. they drift in and out of frame, in and out of focus. we hear a woman's voice clearly the person who is operating the camera, as the shot moves about the room. this is marla chen.}
<C>__{marla}
<P>__{(off screen)}
<D>__{okay, okay. here we go. there's anna...}
<A>__{the camera hesitates for a fleeting moment on anna, a girl with bright dye red hair (on the side of her head that isn't shaved). anna looks, with no particular expression and goes away. the camera turns toward a smudged mirror on the wall and we get a look at marla, a twenty ish asian girl.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{here's marla chen, official deader archivist. hello, me.}
<A>__{he camera turns toward a door as it opens and katya, a young round faced girl with dark hair, comes out, looking a bit nervous.}
<C>__{marla}
<P>__{(off screen)}
<D>__{and here's the star of the show. katya...}
<A>__{she gives a little smile. the camera swings over toward a mattress on the floor. some of the people are tugging a plastic sheet over it. one of them, and the one who clearly appears to be in authority a man with albino like features winter.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{and here's our deader bed this is the scene of the crime. crime to be...}
<A>__{he camera moves in on winter.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{and here is the fearless leader of the deaders... winter.}
<A>__{winter glances up, then dismisses the camera altogether. he looks off screen, then raises his hand. the room quiets. we hear various voices.}
<C>__{voices}
<D>__{shh. quiet. we're starting.}
<A>__{winter looks up and the camera swings toward katya. she hesitates. a girl next to her starts to prompt her.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{do you become one of us of your own free will?}
<C>__{katya}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{are you afraid?}
<C>__{katya}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{good. fear is the place we go to learn.}
<A>__{she hesitates.}
<C>__{atya}
<P>__{(reciting)}
<D>__{my skin isn't real. my eyes aren't real. my muscles aren't real. my bones, my heart, my veins and nerves, and flesh and meat... aren't real. what i see, what i hear, what i taste, what i touch, what i remember, what i think, what i feel, aren't real.}
<C>__{winter}
<P>__{(off screen)}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{katya}
<D>__{i'm not real.}
<A>__{the camera swings back to winter, who gestures for her to come forward, then swings back to see her coming. the various people in the room gather around as she comes to the mattress. the camera moves this way and that, trying to get the best angle to cover the action. people spread towels on the mattress, over the plastic, as katya, naked, sits down on the towels, then lays back, flat on the mattress. inter looks to the black kid standing next to him. he comes up with a big handgun maybe a .45.}
<C>__{katya}
<D>__{i'm not real...}
<A>__{the camera moves in closer as winter takes the gun and slips it into katya's hand.}
<C>__{katya}
<D>__{i'm not... i'm not real...}
<A>__{he slides the gun over and puts it to the side of her head.}
<B>__{amy}
<A>__{...sits forward in her seat, not quite believing what she's seeing.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{holy ... charles...}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{just keep watching.}
<B>__{on the tape}
<A>__{katya is breathing fast now, but we can't be sure if it's terror, or passion, or some combination of both. she continues to lie on the mattress, the barrel of the gun pressed against the side of her head.}
<C>__{katya}
<D>__{i'm not real. i'm not...}
<A>__{winter reaches out, hesitant, and cocks the gun in her hand. meanwhile, we see other hands, reaching in, pressing a folded up towel against the opposite side of her head. other hands come in and press a doubled over pillow against the towel.}
<C>__{katya}
<D>__{i'm not real. i'm not... i'm not...}
<A>__{she closes her eyes, grits her teeth. her back arches.}
<B>__{amy}
<A>__{drops her cigarette as it burns down to her fingers. she stands.}
<B>__{on the tape}
<A>__{katya holds her breath... and pulls the trigger. there's a huge concussion as the bullet tears straight through her head. we can see it splatter out the other side, tearing through the towel and the folded over pillow, which catch a great blast of bone and brain. we hear some screams in the room. amy jumps back.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{have you called the police on this?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{just watch...}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i want to know if you've called the pol...}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{i said, "just watch."}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{oh, man, don't tell me that was some special effect...}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{you tell me.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{this is sick...}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{that's saying a lot, for you.}
<A>__{the camera is now pointing at winter. there is a look of deep tenderness in his face as he circles around and kneels down, staring toward katya, who is lying, as dead as dead can be, on the mattress. blood has run from the ghastly wound down both sides of the plastic, and towels on the side of the bed catch the mess. winter reaches down and gently removes the gun from katya's lifeless hand... and then, light as a feather, lies down on top of her. the camera moves forward and down as marla, presumably, elbows her way through for a better vantage pointerior the camera moves in close as winter stretches out along katya's body. he places his lips on her forehead, kissing her lightly, then presses his lips against hers kissing her or maybe something else. it seems almost as if he's breathing into her. his body moves as his lungs expand and expel, and he seems to be struggling toward some non sexual climax. amy watches, both repelled and fascinated.}
<B>__{on the tape}
<A>__{winter continues his odd ritual, finally taking a great final breath, as if he's reached the point of exhaustion, and expels it. nothing happens. he leans in close.}
<B>__{with amy}
<A>__{amy leans in close as well.}
<B>__{with winter}
<A>__{he draws in another breath he seems to be in agony as he does it presses his lips to katya's dead ones, and exhales. the breath seems to go on forever longer than it should. and then, when it seems as if winter can't breathe out another teaspoon of air, katya's body abruptly twitches beneath him and then she sucks in a ragged breath. her previously open and lifeless eyes, move. her head raises up.}
<B>__{with amy}
<A>__{she simply stares, breathing again for the first time in a moment, unable to quite take in what she's seeing.}
<B>__{on the screen}
<A>__{winter, exhausted, looks down at katya, smiling. there's nervous laughter, sounds of relief from around the room. winter slides off of her. katya looks this way and that, presumably at the others, looking down at her. a hand reaches down and she takes it. the camera follows as winter pulls her unsteadily up to standing. all this despite the fact that there is still an exceedingly large and obvious hole in her head... the size of a dime on one side, the size of a half dollar on the other. the others move in, touching her, congratulating her. she's still a bit shaky, uncertain. then she lifts one of her hands to the side of her head the side with the big exit wound. she touches it gingerly, confirming that it is really there. then she slowly slides her fingers in. they penetrate her skull, unobstructed, to the second knuckle. katya takes her fingers from this ghastly wound and stares at them, bloody. yet she's alive. fine. she looks up at the others, then smiles widely. the others move in, giving her hugs, pecks on the cheek. she touches the wound again. she starts laughing.}
<C>__{katya}
<P>__{(as if actually realizing) it)}
<D>__{i'm fine...}
<C>__{k}
<A>__{she touches the wound again.}
<C>__{atya}
<D>__{i feel great...}
<A>__{she starts laughing.}
<C>__{katya}
<D>__{oh, man! oh, man...}
<A>__{the image cuts off, goes to snow. there is a moment of silence. amy turns to charles.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what the hell...}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{that's what i said.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{have you... have you found any of these...}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{i haven't done anything. i told you, i just looked at it today. by some chance are you... interested in pursuing this?}
<A>__{amy hesitates, shaking her head, not sure what it's all about.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{look, amy. maybe this is just some kind of bull shit shot on tape gore movie. and since that's all it can be, that's all you're going find, but it sure smells different to me. if it's bull shit, you'll know pretty fast. if it's not...}
<A>__{amy, though, is only half listening, lost in her own thoughts.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{how could she...}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{who said miracles can only happen at lourdes?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{who said they happen there?}
<A>__{she lifts her fingers to the side of her head, duplicating the action of katya slipping her fingers inside the wound.}
<C>__{harles}
<D>__{amy... you know what my father said once...}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{that all writers were queers?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{no, that was a different time. this time, we were driving down the block and there was this fortune telling place, you know, this gypsy fortune telling place in a store front? and he said, "you know, if i could tell the future i wouldn't be living in any crappy store front."}
<A>__{he looks back at the tape.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{if i could do that, i wouldn't be hanging out in some rundown basement. i'd own the earth.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{maybe they're just getting started.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what else do we have besides the tape?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{just a return address on the envelope.}
<A>__{he holds up the envelope which is addressed to "amy klein c o the underground". amy hesitates. snatches the envelope out of his hand. she reads the return address.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{looks like your online fan base is growing. it's an address in bucharest. it's where all the euro trash kids looking for a good time are heading these days. amsterdam is so 90's.}
<A>__{she's shocked that he would even know.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{why charles...}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{i still like to keep my finger on the pulse, even though i know you think i don't have one.}
<A>__{she thinks about it. he hands her a thick envelope.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{your ticket, hotel and per diem.}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{you know me too well.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{it's what keeps me up at night.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now here's the part where i'm supposed to say be careful. be careful.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{always.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{call me when you get settled.}
<A>__{she just smirks and exits.}
