<L>__{interior trafalgar hospital. ward. nikolai's room day}
<D>__{nikolai is conscious in bed, attached to a single drip. his wounds have been stitched up. a doctor and two nurses are settling nikolai's vital signs, moving around him, checking his temperature. finally they clear the bed and through the glass of the room we see anna, standing outside, staring in at nikolai.}
<L>__{interior trafalgar hospital. ward. nikolai's room night}
<D>__{nikolai is peering through half opened eyes. the last nurse is checking his vital signs. then anna enters. the nurse stops work...}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{anna?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{is it ok to talk to him for a minute? the nurse hesitates...}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{he's still in trauma. do you know him? anna glances at nikolai who is rousing himself.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{yes. the nurse is reluctant but sees anna's fierce stare and finally leaves. after she has gone nikolai stirs, focuses on her face.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i thought you did birth. nikolai smiles, but anna is trying hard to even out her fear and anger.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{my uncle.... nikolai tries to sit up and registers pain.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{...the one who spat in your face... he's disappeared. a pause. nikolai gasps in pain as he raises himself up. anna sees the wounds on his arms and glimpses the tattoos on his chest, scaring her even more.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{if we don't hear from him soon we're going to the police... nikolai reaches for a bottle of water and manages to take a swig. anna is impatient for a reaction.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{do you know where he is? a pause. nikolai finishes the bottle of water in one thirsty swig. finally...}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{yes. a pause.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{he's in scotland. in edinburgh. in a five star hotel. anna is locating the door in case she has to flee as nikolai swings his legs out of the bed to stretch his painful limbs.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{edinburgh?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i'm going to need some clothes. i arrived here without any. can you get me some? anna doesn't budge.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{i can't walk out of here naked.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you can't walk out of here because you're attached to a drip. explain edinburgh. nikolai sighs, sits back down on the bed. he finally speaks softly.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{your uncle knew too much. nikolai shrugs.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{i was told to get rid of him. i was meant to send him to heaven with a bullet in his head. instead i sent him to edinburgh. with a first class ticket. a pause.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{he is of the old school. he understood the situation. exile or death. edinburgh was his idea. he said they throw a great party at new year. and he said it was a good excuse to get away from his family. nikolai smiles at anna.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{so... just a pair of jeans and a t shirt. a jacket. and some shoes. anna still looks disbelieving. nikolai sighs.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{the hotel is called the caledonian. without a pause anna leaves.}
