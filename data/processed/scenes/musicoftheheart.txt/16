<L>__{interior music room day}
<A>__{in a noisy music room with bad acoustics, roberta tries to take control of fifty kids, third through fifth graders, who are in a state of manic excitement over the fifty violin cases on the floor.}
<C>__{roberta}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{please do not open the cases, o.k.?}
<A>__{they ignore her.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{look, can everyone just settle down and listen to me please?}
<A>__{angle three girls open their cases.}
<C>__{roberta}
<P>__{(starting to lose it)}
<D>__{keep them closed! please.}
<A>__{angle two boys open their cases.}
<C>__{roberta}
<P>__{(to the boys)}
<D>__{did you hear what i just said?}
<A>__{angle three kids are using the violin cases as pretend machine guns and shooting each other.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{put those down, please!}
<A>__{angle a boy and a girl are having a "sword fight" with their bows.}
<C>__{roberta}
<P>__{(to the fencers)}
<D>__{don't do that! put the bows back in the cases right now!}
<A>__{there's the sound of violin strings being plucked.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{who's plucking?}
<A>__{roberta wheels around to find a girl plucking her violin like a banjo, and doing a little dance. this is lucy, a skinny puerto rican girl in perpetual motion.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{what have i been saying? put that away! back in the case!}
<A>__{roberta takes a breath. the kids settle down a bit.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{o.k. thank you. that's much better.}
<P>__{(takes another breath)}
<D>__{i will be dividing you into five classes, but for today }
<A>__{angle a boy plays "bongos" on his violin case.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{o.k. that's it! you! stand up!}
<A>__{the bongo player stands.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{you will be the first student who will not be in my violin class. out!}
<A>__{the child looks stunned.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i said out!}
<A>__{with a sheepish expression, he exits. the room is finally quiet and roberta's amazed that something worked. she puffs up a little bit, enjoying the feeling of control.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{who else would like to be kicked out of my class?}
<A>__{the students stare at her, afraid of her now. de sean, a small but tough black boy, raises his hand.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{are you raising your hand because you want to be kicked out?}
<C>__{de sean}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{de sean}
<D>__{i don't wanna learn no stupid violin. it's for wimps.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{who told you that?}
<C>__{de sean}
<D>__{i just know.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{de sean.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{well, de sean you haven't given me a good enough reason, so you're staying.}
<A>__{she looks around the room.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{anyone else?}
<A>__{silence.}
