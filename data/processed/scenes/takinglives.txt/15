<A>__{we hear breathing and the soft rush of a river. soft, rhythmic. then footsteps. two eyes open, reflect moonlight. the footsteps drawing closer. click! a flashlight turns on. revealing:}
<L>__{exterior forest construction site night}
<A>__{grace vanderholt lies in the grave where the body was discovered. it has been excavated by criminologists, the soil sifted, the grass and brush removed. grace sits up. grace holds out her fbi creds, shielding her eyes from the bright light.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it's okay, i'm supposed to be here.}
<A>__{click. the light goes off. revealing laval and reynaud.}
<C>__{inspector laval}
<D>__{agent vanderholt, we requested your help. i'm inspector laval, this is inspector reynaud.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{hi. look, i'm not ready to talk to you guys yet. i need a little more time here.}
<A>__{reynaud and laval trade looks, walk toward two uniforms guarding the site. grace lays back down. sighs. concentrates on the sounds. the river. wind in the trees. then: laughter (o.s.).}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{would you mind trading one liners somewhere else? i need to hear the natural sounds. i appreciate it.}
<A>__{the policemen have gathered in a chummy knot. laval gestures for them to walk down the road.}
<B>__{on grace}
<A>__{she steps out of the grave. sits by it. writes some notes. everything glistens in the moonlight, alive. grace takes it in for a beat. then: howling, the lonely song of a distant wolf. grace rises, crosses to the river, to a big gravel bar. used as a campsite complete with a large fire pit. grace sits by the fire pit. more howling, closer this time. grace looks down river, sees the glowing eyes of a timber wolf staring from a clump of trees. the animal stares a beat, then runs off. grace has the chills. grace walks quietly toward the trees. grace just a few feet away. rustling. she cautiously moves aside a sapling.}
