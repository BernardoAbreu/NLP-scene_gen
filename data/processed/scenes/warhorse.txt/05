<L>__{interior main auction ring. the same.}
<A>__{the auction ring is full of people of all shapes and sizes. there is a sense of celebration and busyness about market day. we concentrate on two men ted narracott (dad), in his forties, clearly both the cares of the world and alcohol have worn him down before his time, and si easton, his more solid friend, both working farmers. just behind si is his 15 year old son, andrew. ted has a drink in his hand. they all look at joey bridling against the men who are trying to hold him.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{now that's a beauty.}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{forget it, ted. he's half thoroughbred and not got a day's work in him.}
<P>__{(points to a plow horse next to joey)}
<D>__{now, there... there's your ticket.}
<A>__{in contrast to joey, the solid and bulky plow horse stands like a rock. but dad remains fixated on joey.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{but look at him, si. look at that creature.}
<A>__{indeed, joey is magnificent, his power clearly emerging because of his upset.}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{don't be daft. you need something solid to plow a field.}
<C>__{dad}
<P>__{(fixed on joey)}
<D>__{yeah, but he's something else, that one.}
<A>__{the auctioneer announces the start of the auction...}
<C>__{auctioneer}
<D>__{alright gentlemen settle down settle down horses on my right men with money in their pockets on my left it's the perfect combination. is fred goddard here?}
<A>__{fred shouts his reply from the crowd.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{yes! i's here.}
<C>__{auctioneer}
<D>__{good more money than sense. dave hill?}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{i'm here. yes!}
<C>__{auctioneer}
<D>__{bugger off, you tight bastard you've been coming here for 20 years never bought so much as a pork scratching.}
<A>__{the crowd are loving all this. dad notices a figure across the ring, lyons, clearly a man of money. you can see something light up in dad's eyes a combination of dislike and alcohol. joey is led into the auction pen.}
<C>__{auctioneer }
<D>__{okay first up today a gorgeous young horse prettiest thing i've seen since my wife on our wedding day. let's get going, shall we? who wants this wonderful creature.}
<A>__{but no one bids.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{one guinea.}
<C>__{auctioneer}
<D>__{one guinea, one guinea, one guinea...}
<C>__{young andrew easton}
<D>__{i thought you needed a plow horse, mister narracott.}
<C>__{auctioneer}
<D>__{any advance on one guinea? any advance on one guinea?}
<A>__{joey is still trying to get back to his mother. a voice from the crowd pipes up:}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{two guineas.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{three!}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{ted narracott it's completely the wrong animal.}
<A>__{lyons whispers to his son, david, 15, next to him. david eyes joey skeptically.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{si easton i'm not gonna let that bastard see me off.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{five guineas.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{six!}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{oh for the love of...!}
<A>__{joey is straining to get to his mother, the men are pulling him back.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{seven.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{greedy sod thinks he can just buy anybody.}
<P>__{(bidding)}
<D>__{eight.}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{stop it he's your landlord you can't be picking fights with him.}
<A>__{lyons looks over. there is now tension in the crowd as they sense a battle royal for the horse.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{ten guineas.}
<A>__{he smirks at dad.}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{you haven't got the money. let's go home let's have a pinterior}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{eleven guineas, sir, from as good a man as any in this town.}
<A>__{they all look at lyons in his suit and bowler hat.}
<C>__{auctioneer}
<D>__{do i hear twelve guineas? twelve guineas?}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{that's top price for a workin' animal. ted! save it for the shire!}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{there are big days and there are small days. which will it be?}
<C>__{auctioneer}
<D>__{do i hear any advance on eleven guineas?}
<A>__{all eyes are on lyons and his son david is 15, smartly dressed.}
<C>__{david lyons}
<D>__{just let him go, dad, i don't care for him, he's too... jumpy.}
<A>__{lyons isn't listening to david; he's looking hard at ted.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{shall we say twenty five?}
<A>__{the crowd gasps. this is clearly personal.}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{well, he's got you there. nice try, ted.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{you were great, mr n. gave him a run for his money.}
<A>__{but when he looks at ted, ted's eyes are locked into the eyes of his rival.}
<C>__{auctioneer}
<D>__{going, going...}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{thirty. thirty guineas!}
<A>__{total silence. he stares hard at lyons. who simply smiles, raises an eyebrow, tips his hat and walks away. it dawns on dad that he's won the auction. he breaks into a sweat.}
<C>__{auctioneer}
<D>__{thirty guineas. thirty guineas. going going gone to mister ted narracott.}
<A>__{he bangs his gavel. it's a done deal.}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{what have you done, ted? what have you done?}
<A>__{dad doesn't acknowledge si. moments later ted stands staring at joey, who looks back. ted holds his reins numbly, accepts his receipt from the auction man in a kind of daze. suddenly, lyons appears at dad's shoulder.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{quite a beast, there. but what you gonna do with him on a working farm? i hope you got the rent, ted. i will be around for it when it comes due.}
<A>__{dad does not acknowledge lyons. lyons smiles and walks away with son david, and his cronies. si shakes his head at dad.}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{you're a fool, ted. and our rosie'll never forgive you.}
