<L>__{exterior hudson street day}
<A>__{zoe has her head held high and her cute belly pushed out as far as it will go. a woman with a double stroller approaches. zoe smiles.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{twin toddlers}
<D>__{hi. hi.}
<A>__{zoe walks on. she sees her reflection in a store window and smiles. she looks like an actual pregnant person now. as she is walking and smiling to herself, we hear a familiar voice.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{her p.o.v. stan appears next to her in the reflection. for a brief second, they look like a family. zoe turns. they both stop. unsure of whether to hug or what. they just stand there.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{you said that already.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you...look great.}
<A>__{zoe touches her belly. proud but protective.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{how are you feeling?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{a long silence.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{you have a beard.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{yeah, it's awful isn't it.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{don't lie.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{did i tell you how pretty you look?}
<A>__{zoe nods. another silence.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{i miss you.}
<A>__{a group of school kids, lost in their own conversations, push up the block, separating zoe and stan for a moment. this separation makes the moment all the more tense.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i miss you, too.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{this whole time we've been apart, i've been trying to figure out what it is about you that i love so much. and i think that it's that a lot of people talk about doing things, but you actually do them. you're really kind of daring. how you quit your job and took over a pet store all because some asshole sold you a lame dog. you came and found me at the farmer's market even though the night before i acted like a total stalker...}
<A>__{zoe smiles at the memory. stan continues.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{and now you're pregnant. because you wanted to have a baby and didn't think you could wait any longer. well, that's just the same kind of thing. it's...brave. and i can't love you for being that way but then walk away for the same reason.}
<A>__{stan takes her hands.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{i love you. i've been waiting my whole life for you. and i can't let one little baby get in the way of that. i just...can't.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{there's something i need to tell you.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{it's big. and you're allowed to take all of this back when i tell you.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{what.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{it's not just one baby....i'm having twins.}
<A>__{stan looks at her. is she joking? her look says no. he takes a beat. and then, even though it's not a joke, he starts to laugh. a little laugh at first and then a big one. and then, zoe starts laughing too. the whole thing is just so ridiculous.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{this is insane.}
