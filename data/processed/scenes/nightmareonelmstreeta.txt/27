<L>__{exterior tina's street. night.}
<A>__{tina runs out onto front lawns, screaming for help. no help comes. in fact, the only response is for all the porch lights on the block to be turned off. the man roars out from behind a tree a tree too narrow to have hidden him nearly upon the girl! tina runs in panic at last making her own home, only to be trapped against its locked front door. she hammers against its thick wood.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{nancy! open the door nancy!}
<A>__{the man slows. he has tina now and knows it.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{she's still awake. nancy can't hear you.}
<A>__{tina turns and looks full at the approaching man. smudged by deep shadow, he's big and hideous. he wears the same dirty yellow sweater from the first nightmare from the wall hanging and blanket too and has the same sagging hat and leering grin over his misshapen face. and on his fingers are the steel talons. close on him as he takes the blade on the end of his right index finger and lopes off one of the fingers of his left hand. then another. we see the pieces of fingers fall past tina's face in}
<B>__{slow motion.}
<A>__{angle on the ground of the fingers squirming on the ground, one flopping onto tina's naked foot. tina leaps back, sickened, and begins stamping on then as if they were huge bugs. the man snaps up his arm and the fingers fly back into place on his hand. he leers at tina then suddenly lunges at her, sweeping with his cutting hand! tina's no weak sister blocks his arm, deflecting the spines, and grabs the man's ugly face with her other hand. but the face only slides off to the bone . the man presses in, and tina contorts in horror as the knives slash across her shoulder cutting her deeply. tina staggers backward, groaning, her foot now inexplicably caught in bedclothes! she falls over her bed's conformter, twists away from the man and, like a child, pulls the cover over her! the skull faced man crushes down, and there's a fierce grappling punctuated by his grunts and the girl's deafening screams and they both become totally wrapped in the comforter until they're beneath it, fighting for life and death.}
