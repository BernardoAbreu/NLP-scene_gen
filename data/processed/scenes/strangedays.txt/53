<A>__{a black limo pulls into the lot. it is a continental armored stretch, downsized from today's standards. the door opens and mace gets out. she is compactly built, dressed in black slacks, a conservative black jacket, heavy rubber soled shoes. she glances around as she heads for the coral lounge entrance, the unconscious sweeping gaze of a security professional.}

<D>__{see, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{an ex cop that doesn't carry. it's embarrassing. i oughta not be seen with you.}
<P>__{(as she slips up behind them)}

<P>__{(attention caught by tv)}
<D>__{hey, bobby, turn that up.}
<A>__{the bartender obeys: it's more news about the jeriko one killing. there's file footage of jeriko and his band, the prophets of rage; interview with a lot of furious fans, mostly black inner city kids; and a news clip of jeriko at an outdoor rally, exhorting the crowd with near religious fervor:}
<C>__{jeriko one }
<D>__{the lapd is a military force turned against its own people. we live in a police state! the mayor and the city council sit up in their offices with their social programs that don't work... they're rearranging deck chairs on the titanic. but the new day is coming! two k is coming! the day of reckoning is upon us. history ends and begins again right here! right now!}
<A>__{max raises a glass in salute to the tv screen.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{to the end of all things!}
<P>__{(slugs down the shot)}
<D>__{you know how i know it's the end of the world? because everything's been done, every kind of music's been tried, every government's been tried, every fuckin' hairstyle. how you gonna make it another thousand years, for chrissake?}
<A>__{on the tv, clip of jeriko's speech has been replaced by an interview with jeriko one's manager. tran vo. tran is vietnamese, and around lenny's age. he's angular, suave, cool as an early frost. dialed in. lenny sees his face on the screen like a personal nightmare.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i'm telling ya, it's over. we used it all up }
<C>__{lenny}
<P>__{(riveted to the tv)}
<D>__{shutup a second!}

<D>__{but i mean isn't he faith's new }
<P>__{(she mouths the word "boyfriend")}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{sssssh! not in front of lenny. you may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.}
<A>__{on the screen, tran is being jostled as he walks, answering the reporters questions in a glare of minicam lights.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{the lapd have said they believe this is a gang related incident. can you comment on that, mr. vo?}
<C>__{tran}
<D>__{we have no facts yet. all we know for sure is that we have lost a great artist, that a great voice for change is now silent...}
<A>__{lenny, scowling, pushes away from the bar. mace goes with him.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{thanks for giving me a ride. i just have a few stops, mostly on the west side }
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{whoa, whoa, whoa. i said i'd drop you home, but i'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds. i've already pulled twelve hours today.}
<C>__{lenny}
<P>__{(upbeat again)}
<D>__{come on, mace. this is gonna be a big night. can't you feel it? the energy in the air? there's money to be made, dreams to sell.}

<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{mace, you're my friend. i need you. plus i will give you 25% of what i make tonight.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.}
<A>__{lenny starts to whine like a puppy. mace gives up.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{jeez, you're pathetic. okay, i got a pickup at the st. james. i will take you there, you can get a cab.}
