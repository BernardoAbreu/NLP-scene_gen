<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(cold)}
<D>__{take it.}
<A>__{without hesitation the cubans pull the large brass compass from its base.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{now, get the hell off my ship.}
<A>__{as they leave the ship, they pause. the commander looks back at the skipper, then deliberately drops both sextant and compass into the sea.}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{you'll really have something to teach your students now.}

<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{las estrellas es lo unico, que un marinero verdadero se mesesita para encontrarse. verdade patron?}

<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{alright then, let's get outta here.}
<A>__{the crew bolt to there positions.}
<C>__{older chuck }
<D>__{with staff and string he showed us how to build a sextant. as we rode the trades, he shared the ancient secrets of how to read the waves and follow stars. and some mornings later, bathed in the orange glow of a sunrise, panama rose from the sea like a phoenix.}
