<A>__{something is wrong with him. he is bleeding from the head. he stands almost motionless. in shock. jeffrey peers into the room again. he enters carefully and lets the door close behind him. he very cautiously moves forward into the room. slowly he moves closer to a hideous sight. standing in the middle of dorothy's apartment is t.r. gordon, the yellow man. he is in an extreme state of shock. he is bleeding badly from a huge wound at the top left of his head. his eyes focused on something only his twisted inner mind see. sitting in one of dorothy's chairs is a dead man with no ears. only half healed bloody wounds at each side of his head. a bullet hole in the center of his forehead. the t.v. is crushed in but it is turned on and it is the television that produces the high electrical whine. jeffrey moves forward again and kicks the television cord out of the wall. the high whine stops instantly. silence except for the yellow man's labored breathing. suddenly there is a loud "radio voice" coming from the yellow man's police radio which is turned "on" in his jacket pocket. jeffrey's heart leaps and just as suddenly the yellow man throws his arms out wildly knocking a floor lamp to the ground and crushing out its light. jeffrey's heart goes wild at this sight and he jumps back but the yellow man is silent and motionless again. the radio talks again.}
