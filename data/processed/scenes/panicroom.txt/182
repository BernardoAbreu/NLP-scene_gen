<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{in the master bedroom, meg pulls on a pair of jeans that are hanging over a chair. she steps into a pair of boots. she shoves the gun into her belt. here in the bedroom, she can hear the drill. from the house next door, she hears pounding again, more muffled curses. apparently the neighbor can hear the drill too. meg looks from the walls of the bedroom to the walls of the panic room. her eyes light up with an idea. she goes to the front wall of the bedroom, stands with her back against the exterior wall (street side), with her left shoulder against the common wall that's shared with the neighbor's brownstone. she begins to step off the distance, heel to toe, measuring with her feet until she reaches the metal door that is the entrance to the panic room.}
