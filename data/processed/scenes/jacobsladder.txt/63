<A>__{jacob hurries into the bedroom and pulls an old shoe box from the closet. the box is filled with yellowing army papers, dog tags, and photos of old comrades. beneath his discharge papers he finds a sheet scribbled with the names and addresses of platoon buddies. jacob grabs it. then his eyes fall on the frayed remains of an old letter. he picks it up and unfolds it with great care. the letter is written in a child's handwriting. "dear daddy, i love you. please come home. jed got a frog. eli lost my key. mom wants you to send her money. love, gabe."}
