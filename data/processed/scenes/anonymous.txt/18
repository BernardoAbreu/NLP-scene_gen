<C>__{southampton}
<D>__{the stage craft is quite spectacular. far more elaborate than anything i've seen at court. i've witnessed be headings that god as my witness look as real as at the tower, cannons fired in battle...}
<A>__{they come to the second floor, where a selling maid has a box of food and drink in front of her bosom much like a match stick girl.}
<D>__{selling maid ale? mutton, mi' lord?}
<A>__{southampton waves her off as they follow the usher up another flight of stairs.}

<A>__{oxford continues up, two steps behind southampton. they come to the third floor and enter the box seating area reserved for nobles, giving oxford his first real look at the theater itself. oxford looks around and sees from oxford's pov audience members laughing others drinking maids selling food the actors acting... it's alive. magical.}
<B>__{back to oxford}
<A>__{oxford takes it all in, almost stunned by it. on stage the actor william shakespeare (30) plays a commoner. he is handsome, sexy, charismatic; and holds a tankard of ale, and swigs from it constantly. another actor spencer (30) plays "fastidious"; a pompous, over dressed, caricature of a nobleman. he wears an enormous feather on his hat. also on stage is an actor called john heminge (late 40's), who plays "sogliardo"}
<C>__{shakespeare}
<D>__{and whither were you riding now, signior? "fastidious" who, i? what a silly jest's that! whither should i ride but to the court?}
<C>__{shakespeare}
<D>__{o, pardon me, sir, twenty places more; your hot house, your pig house, or your whore house!}
<A>__{the audience roars in laughter as shakespeare looks below at a buxom young lady among the "groundlings". he smiles seductively. she smiles back.}

<A>__{jonson (now 25 and clean shaven) is watching the performance from behind a curtain, silently speaking the lines with the actors.}
<B>__{in the raised seating}
<A>__{a group of playwrights and poets watch the play with an air of judgement. they are: christopher "kit" marlowe (32), young, brilliant, a bit foppish (he likes the boys), thomas nashe (late 30's) a heavy set, a hard drinking satirist and thomas dekker (29), considered a bit of a hack by his colleagues. they are called the "mermaid's wits" because they frequent a pub named the mermaid's tavern.}

<C>__{marlowe}
<D>__{that might be so, but like a grain of wheat hid in a bushel of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find it, and when you have it, it's not worth the search!}

<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{marlowe spot me a few pence, will you? henslowe still owes me for "shoemaker's holiday".}
<C>__{marlowe}

<D>__{but with whom? tell me not he prefers the company of such old grey men as that!}
<A>__{nashe squints.}
<C>__{nashe}
<D>__{i think yes, by the beard, that's the earl of oxford. old tom hooker used to play for him. had his own acting troupe for private court performances and the like.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{i wonder if he needs any material?}
<C>__{marlowe}
<D>__{certainly not any of yours.}
<C>__{nashe}
<D>__{no, no that was years ago. had a falling out with the queen, i heard. he's more of a recluse than a patron these days.}

<A>__{shakespeare points to "fastidious".}
<C>__{shakespeare}
<D>__{who, he, the noble there? why, he's a gull, a fool, no salt in him i' the earth; man, he looks like a fresh salmon kept in a tub!}
<A>__{shakespeare struts around as though he owned the place. the more he talks, the more the audience roars in laughter.}
<C>__{shakespeare }

<A>__{shakespeare continues his rant, speaking directly to the groundlings.}
<C>__{shakespeare}
<D>__{he has his skin tann'd in civet, to make his complexion strong, and the sweetness of his youth lasting in the sense of his sweet lady. and, sadly, the poor man's brain is lighter than his feather...}
<A>__{as the audience howls in laughter, we see:}
<B>__{a nobleman}
<A>__{with a feathered hat gets up in fury, and exits the theater, his lady with him. the audience laughs at him as he goes.}
<B>__{on stage}
<A>__{shakespeare smiles triumphantly.}
<C>__{shakespeare }
<D>__{he is a good and empty puff, but he loves you well, signior. i wish you well with him.}

<B>__{backstage}
<A>__{later in the play... shakespeare returns backstage and takes a deep swig from his tankard. he's actually drunk, though his performance didn't show it at all. he spots jonson, and grabs him.}

<C>__{henslowe }
<D>__{will! will shakespeare!}
<A>__{shakespeare turns to see a furious philip henslowe (50's) heading his way.}

<A>__{complete panic erupts as dozens of the queen's guard storm into the theater. everyone tries to get out as quickly as possible, including the other actors, henry condell (20's), thomas pope (30's), william sly (13). sir richard pole, the captain of the guard jumps on stage.}
