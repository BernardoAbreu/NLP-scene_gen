<L>__{exterior stone wall and stream moving view night}
<A>__{a group of men with flashlights and guns lead michael, tom and rocco to the stone bridge spanning the stream which runs through the estate.}
<B>__{low close view}
<A>__{michael's dispassionate face, looking down. the view moves to hagen's, and then down to the murky water under the bridge, where we see the bodies of three strangers, lying in the moving water; machine type guns nearby, with their throats cut. light from the many flashlights illuminates the grotesque scene.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{fish them out.}
<A>__{several of the men wade down into the stream; rocco helps, and even tom steps down to get a better look at who they were. they are total strangers; rocco examines the type of guns they used. when they climb back onto the ground, michael is gone. everyone notices it, but no one says anything. hagen stands there, holding the envelope michael had given him in his hand. he realizes that now, he is the don.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{get rid of the bodies. tomorrow morning i want a report made to the local police, and paper, that some explosives we keep on the property were accidentally ignited.}
<A>__{the men respond; hagen makes the lonely walk back to the lighted section of the compound, which now resembles a prison camp.}
