<L>__{exterior dickie's terrace. late day.}
<A>__{marge and ripley and dickie watch from the terrace as below them an ambulance takes away the body. it seems as if the whole town looks on fiancee, parents, brothers, sisters, police, priest, etc. as the corpse is loaded into the vehicle a brief scuffle occurs between silvana's fiancee and her brother. they are pulled apart. then the ambulance pulls away.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what's the fight about? that's her fiance, isn't it? are they blaming him?}
<C>__{dickie}
<P>__{(sharp)}
<D>__{i don't know! why are you asking me?}
<P>__{(agitated)}
<D>__{how can it take an hour to find an ambulance?}
<C>__{marge}
<P>__{(conciliatory)}
<D>__{well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so i suppose }
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{i don't know why people say this country's civilised. it isn't. it's fucking primitive.}
<A>__{and with that he kicks out violently at a chair supporting the recordplayer. records, machine, chair go flying across the terrace. dickie storms inside.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{dickie!}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i will go and see what's the matter.}
