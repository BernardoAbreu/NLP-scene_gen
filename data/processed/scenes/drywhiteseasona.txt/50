<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior viljoen's office day}
<A>__{behind the large desk, colonel viljeon replaces the tele phone receiver; there is a knock on the door and a young policeman ushers in ben. colonel viljoen stands and ex tends a hand.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{come in, mr. du toit, come in. how do you do?}
<A>__{they shake. he's a large, friendly man, ruddy face, gray crew cut.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{nice to meet you, colonel viljoen.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{i used to watch you play for the transvaal. you were one of the great wing forwards.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{long time ago.}
<A>__{there's a knock on the door.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{the door opens revealing captain stolz.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{captain stolz, mr. du toit.}
<A>__{captain stolz nods correctly, unsmiling, comfortably dressed, english style. he shakes hands with ben. then walks toward the window and stands there. as he's watching ben, he begins to clean out his pipe with a silver penknife;}
<C>__{viljoen}
<P>__{(to ben)}
<D>__{do sit down.}
<A>__{ben sinks into a low leather chair before the desk. be hind him he can feel stolz's eyes. viljoen peers through his half moons at the letter in front of him. the pipe scraping continues behind ben's ear.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{all right now, gordon ngubene.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well... to put it simply, colonel...}
<C>__{viljoen}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i'm always grateful for that.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i thought there might have been some kind of misunderstanding i could help straighten out.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i know him, colonel. he works at my school. he's done work for me too.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{and you feel you know him enough to vouch for him.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{yes, after so many years... 10 years. gordon's not the type to get himself in trouble. he's an honest, hard working, church going man.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{ha! you'd be surprised how many honest, decent, church going men we come across during a working day.}
<A>__{he leans back comfortably in his chair.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{it's routine, mr. du toit a routine enquiry. cleaning up these townships we must leave no stone unturned.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i appreciate that but gordon would never...}
<C>__{viljoen}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{not an easy task either the press screaming blue murder especially the english.}
<C>__{viljoen }
<D>__{and they'll be the first to squeal if the reds took over, make no mistake. rushing back overseas clutching their bloody british passports. have you any idea what will happen here if we don't follow every lead? we have a duty obligation. you have your job we have ours.}
<A>__{ben hastens to reassure him. he looks directly at ben, frank, open, trustworthy.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{colonel believe me, i'm with you all the way. but in this case i'm sure that in your worthy pursuit of the guilty you have, unwittingly, involved the innocent. after all, we're all human. we all make mistakes sometimes.}
<A>__{viljoen laughs again.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{we are indeed, mr. du toit we are indeed. though there's many who might need persuading as to that fact.}
<A>__{then... authority.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{mr. du toit. while you're here, would you mind if i asked you a few questions about ngubene?}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(genuinely)}
<D>__{colonel, i'd welcome it.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{good!}
<A>__{there's another pause. the colonel takes out a fountain pen unscrews it and arranges a sheet before him before speaking.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{shall we start with his son?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{jonathan.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{the eldest.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{yes. he died some time ago.}
<A>__{viljoen doesn't react.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{what do you know about gordon's activities since jonathan's death?}
<A>__{the noise stops behind.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{nothing, colonel.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{did gordon ever discuss the death with you?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{of course he did he was upset.}
<A>__{the colonel pauses.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{but he accepted the truth?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{he is a religious man... in the end he would have resigned himself to it.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{would have? you mean he didn't? was he angry? rebellious?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{come on, colonel! if one of your kids died...}
<P>__{(nods to family picture on desk)}
<D>__{... and nobody would tell you how it happened or where his body is buried, wouldn't you be upset?}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{we told him how his son died, mr. du toit.}
<A>__{ben turns back, surprised.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{you have a son, mr. du toit?}
<A>__{the colonel looks up at him... the first sign of steel in his eyes... then back to the papers. the noise starts again behind ben.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{does he burn and destroy everything he can lay his hands on?... no and neither does mine. that's what i can't understand... after everything the government does for them.}
<P>__{(looks straight at ben)}
<D>__{think about it, mr. du toit. we're for you, not against you.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(irritably)}
<D>__{i've never doubted it, colonel. it's you who appear to be doubting me. these questions. you're making me feel like a criminal.}
<A>__{there's a moment's pause then a burst of laughter.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mr. du toit... i'm sorry. it's force of habit. once a policeman, always a policeman, eh?}
<A>__{more laughter ben joins in. viljoen stands, signalling an end to the meeting.}
