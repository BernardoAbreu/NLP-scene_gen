<A>__{dodge, epps, greer and murphy sit around the galley table.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{out here? what, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{somebody's probably looking for her as we speak.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. we've got every right to salvage her.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{you mean tow her back? that's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{we've done it before.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. but we got half the bering sea and the whole alaskan gulf to drag her over.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{you have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? the fittings alone could go for a few million.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{if you get it back in one piece.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{it's a risk i'm willing to take.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{all we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{so we cut her loose and wait it out. a little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{it's a bloody navigation hazard. one boat can't control a ship that size.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{the damn thing's been floating around for god knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. so we take it easy. a little of the old push pull.}
<A>__{a long beat as they hold there.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{listen. forget this job's just a pay check for a minute. you know i've been good to you. but i'm prepared to offer you something better now.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{if we do this right, it's worth a lot of money. a lot of money.}
<A>__{they hold there looking on at him, waiting.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. at least. who knows, could be more. could be a lot more.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{what i'm proposing is... we split it four ways.}
<A>__{a beat. dodge looks to epps and greer.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{think about it. a million bucks a piece.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{you want to spend the rest of your days drag assing tank barges on the gulf coast, fine. otherwise, let's get to work.}
