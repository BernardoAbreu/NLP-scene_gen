<L>__{exterior dead end street day}
<A>__{the ivans pull up in their transport trucks. they see all the blood and rush towards slovo. but something doesn't look right. ivan 1 tastes the blood and spits it out.}
<C>__{ivan 1}
<D>__{it's sweet.}
<A>__{ivan 2 pulls a chrome dart from slovo's chest. slovo groans.}
<L>__{interior nightclub night}
<A>__{it's a crowded basement rave club. hot and sweaty ravers dance in provocative outfits. the anarchy 99 group is standing on the best booth, right on the packed dance floor. surrounding them are a handful of mafiya bodyguards who stand at attention like the secret service. anders swings from a water pipe and then drops onto the table, smashing glass. a drunk guy tries to pull petra onto the dance floor and she punches him. the bodyguards drag the dude out for a proper thrashing. yorgi shatters a bottle against the wall.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{total chaos, man! welcome to anarchy 99!}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{what's "anarchy 99"?}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{it's all this craziness! it's what we've been living since 99, when we left the army. one of our brothers died in grozny and we said the hell with this shit. what for? he dies for what? politics? who's politics? not ours.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{you wanna see my politics?}
<A>__{xander shows him a tattoo on his arm. it shows planet earth with a giant screw through it.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{screw the world. if i'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{that's what i'm talking about, man! that's why anarchy 99 was born.}
<A>__{yorgi rolls up his sleeve, revealing an anarchy 99 tat (a circled "a" with "99" underneath).}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{to us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. it's everybody does what he wants. people think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. there's an old punk song. it says: "america stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'anarchy burger' by the vandals.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{you got it, man. it's stupid but it's true. true freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. that's when you know you're living, man.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{how you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{easy. you get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.}
<A>__{yorgi throws a fistful of money onto the dance floor. the xed out ravers swat it around like confetti.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{you hang with us, buddy, taste some freedom! petra! dance with this guy!}
<A>__{yorgi melts into the dance floor crowd, leaving xander alone with petra. she gets up grumpily and starts dancing. xander joins her, but she won't even look at him.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{this is great, dancing with the back of your head.}
<A>__{she reluctantly turns around.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{if you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{yorgi asked me to.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{you do everything yorgi says?}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{go to hell.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{it's gonna be like that, huh? you got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. why's that?}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{mind your business.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{did you guys used to date? that's it, right? he broke your heart and you're still soft on him. that's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you.}
<A>__{she glares at him and walks away. xander follows.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{why are you still hanging around? your business is finished, you should go home.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i was invited. what's your story?}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{i don't know who you are or where you come from, but i don't like you. you ask too many questions.}
<A>__{there's a big line outside the "ladies" and no line at the "men's". petra heads into the men's room. some dude whistles at her. she pushes him out of the way and enters a stall. xander leans on the sink.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{come on, don't front like that. you'll put a guy right off you.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{don't even bother, x man, i'm not your type.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{that right? why's that?}
<A>__{the stall door flies open and petra marches out.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{my chest is too small and my brain is too big.}
<A>__{she shoves him to the door and stomps back to her stall. xander walks back out, shaking his head and laughing. across the room, viktor shoves the d.j. out of the way and puts on "anarchy burger" by the vandals. the rave dance is interrupted by the pounding punk beat.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{xander, check it out! the revolution begins!}
<A>__{viktor and anders swiftly turn the dance floor into a violent mosh pit. xander can't help it, he actually likes these guys.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{let's get some air, man.}
<A>__{yorgi and xander head outside. a moment later, kirill hurries out another door.}
