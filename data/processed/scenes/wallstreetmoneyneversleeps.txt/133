<A>__{upset, she looks for her keys.}
<C>__{winnie}
<D>__{i have to go to work.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{bretton owed him a favor because he fed your father information twenty three years ago when he was a young broker in london and your father never ratted him out.}
<A>__{she just looks at him... shaking her head... and not in disapproval... but in pity. but he keeps going.}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{and he never put the money into bretton's fund. turns out your trust had built up a controlling position in hudson river bank.}
