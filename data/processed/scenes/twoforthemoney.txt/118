<A>__{no. when you lose 10 out of 12, fuck doesn't quite cover it. what would be more appropriate is something like "holy fucking shit!" or "my fucking god." or "jesus fucking christ!"}

<A>__{enough. i get the idea, walter.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{you're right. i mean 2 for 12 on our biggest volume weekend what the hell's left to say? except maybe keep the phone number and switch it over to a fucking suicide hotline! brandon hefts the golf bag, walks away. yelling after him }
