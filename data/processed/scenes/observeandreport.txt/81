<L>__{interior mall day}
<A>__{ronnie sits down on one of the benches in the mall. he watches a couple walk by, their little kid swinging between their arms. then, stevie comes in and takes a seat next to ronnie.}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{what are you doing, ronnie?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm just taking a break. what do you want, stevie? i don't have time to fuck around with you today.}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{i got something.}
<A>__{stevie reaches into his pocket. he pulls out a bunch of polaroids of penises.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{what the fuck is this?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{dude, i found these all over the mall. i'm guessing that whoever this mall flasher is, left these for girls to find.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{this thing gets grosser and grosser all the time. well, thanks for the clue. maybe i can use this to identify the freak. you can skate all you want around here.}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{what's wrong with you, ronnie?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{i don't know. you just seem kind of sad.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{nah, man, i'm fine. i mean, i'm catchin' perverts and protecting this mall and just you know, really livin' the dream.}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{that's cool. look, man, you want to get high?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{no, i don't want to get high.}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{that's cool.}
<A>__{the conversation dies down and the two just kind of sit there.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{and by the way, if i see you getting high, i will call the police and have your criminal ass arrested. don't you fuckin' ever mistake my kindness for weakness. i hate drugs and i hate you too.}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{fine, you fucking dick.}
<A>__{steve stands up to leave. ronnie sits there looking sad.}
