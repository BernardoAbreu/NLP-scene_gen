<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{ishmael stands at an open closet. cardboard boxes have been set aside. one has been searched for treasure. the page is in his hand. only slightly discolored by age.}
<C>__{hatsue }
<D>__{dear ishmael. these things are very difficult to say. i can't think of anything more painful than writing this letter.}
<A>__{he closes his eyes.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{think of reading it.}
<C>__{hatsue }
<D>__{i don't love you, ishmael. there is no more honest way to say it.}
<A>__{he carries the letter to the twin bed. where he slept alone. thinking of her.}
<C>__{hatsue }
<D>__{whenever we were together, i knew it. i loved you and i didn't love you at the same moment.}
<A>__{he sinks slowly. as if beneath the letter's weight.}
<C>__{hatsue }
<D>__{the last time. at the cedar tree. i knew we could never be right together. and that soon i would have to tell you.}
<A>__{his eyes are dry. the letter has used up his tears long ago.}
<C>__{hatsue }
<D>__{this is the last time i will write to you. i am not yours anymore.}
<A>__{he sets the letter on the bed beside him.}
<C>__{hatsue }
<D>__{i wish you the very best. your heart is large and you are gentle and kind. i know you will do great things in the world.}
<A>__{he reaches now to his inside coat pocket. withdrawing...}
<C>__{hatsue }
<D>__{i must say good bye to you now. our lives will move on. the best we can.}
<A>__{...a page. folded in quarters. sets it near the letter.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{milholland's report was like her letter. something no one else. would ever read.}
<A>__{he stares at them. side by side.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{thing about having only one hand. it's hard to tear pages up. and i wasn't carrying a match.}
<A>__{he lies back. across the bed.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{so i thought of my father. the man who would have taken this report to judge fielding.}
<A>__{tears stand in his eyes.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{but every reporter. chooses his own balance. finds the facts that matter.}
<A>__{shuts the eyes. against them. against everything.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{after all, the freighter was only a theory. it proved nothing at all. there were other facts. that mattered.}
<A>__{we close on his face. the tightness of the muscles.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{tomorrow i would write a column. about prejudice. and she would be grateful. for my large...and gentle...heart.}
<A>__{the eyes open, they are blank. staring...}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{her husband would be judged. and she would be alone.}
<A>__{...at the future.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{alone. the past looks different.}
