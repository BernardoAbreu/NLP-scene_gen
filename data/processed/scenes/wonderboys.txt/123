<A>__{as a chubby woman stands to acknowledge the applause, grady cranes his neck, searching the sea of seats. to his surprise, he finds crabtree sitting prominently in the front row, in his shirtsleeves, smiling his spookily complacent smile. james is next to him, now wearing crabtree's metallic sports coat over grady's flannel shirt.}

<D>__{now, this next one, i think, is especially exciting to announce, because it concerns a student here at the university. our own james leer, a sophomore in english literature, has found a publisher for his first novel, which i believe is called the lovely parade.}
<A>__{grady blinks, leans forward, and watches walter smile warmly toward the front row. crabtree gives james a jab in the ribs and slowly, awkwardly, james rises. stunned, carrie mcwhirty turns to the girl next to her.}

<C>__{walter}
<D>__{until next year. thank you, everyone.}
<A>__{the lights come up. as the auditorium empties, crabtree shakes walter's hand and jeff and his goatee escort hannah green down the aisle, where she drapes her lovely arms around james. grady watches them ail, sitting alone in his row, when suddenly sara appears over james' shoulder. she says something congratulatory, turns, and exits out a side door. grady blinks, scrambles up.}
