<A>__{hagen alone in the office. he is drinking. he looks up at the sound of cars; the caporegimes are arriving. then he hears footsteps. the door opens; and in a robe, with slippers, don corleone slowly enters the room. he walks directly to his stuffed armchair, sits down. his face is stern, as he looks into hagen's eyes.}
