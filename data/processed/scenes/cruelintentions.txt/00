<L>__{exterior manhattan skyline day}
<A>__{we circle around the island of manhattan moving closer and closer till we're looking down on fifth avenue. as the melody continues to play we move towards a building and zoom into a window.}
<L>__{interior therapist's office day}
<A>__{a fifty year old female therapist (dr. greenbaum) sits at her desk, frowning as she takes notes. books of jung and freud line the shelves. a young man (sebastian valmont) sits in a chair in front of her looking impatient. the therapist continues to write notes.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{jesus. we've been at this for six months.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{and you haven't made an ounce of progress.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{sebastian takes out a cigarette.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<P>__{(not looking up)}
<D>__{there's no smoking in my office.}
<A>__{sebastian sneers at her then puts the cigarette away. dr. greenbaum finishes her notes and looks up at him, shaking her head.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{what do you want me to say? that i'm supposed to feel remorse because i act the way i do? the truth is i don't.}
<A>__{dr. greenbaum shakes her head and takes notes.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{look, i'm not like all the other kids in high school. i don't care about book reports and extra credit. teachers are idiots anyway. the only challenge out there for me is women. you see a girl you like. you pursue them. you conquer. you move on. it's exciting.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{but you said you have the worst reputation.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{don't you want to change that?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{let me tell you something, doctor. chicks love a guy with a bad rap. they say they don't, but they don't mean it. they all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." the trick is to let them think it's true.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{i think that's all the time we have for today.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{same time next week?}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{no. this is going to be our last session.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{why? i like spending time with you. you know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. you have killer legs. killer.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{this isn't a joke. your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. i'm trying to help you.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{don't be insecure, doc. you're a big help.}
<A>__{sebastian picks up a book of freud.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{he was a coke addict, you know.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{you think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. it doesn't work, sebastian.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{it works a little.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{no it doesn't. i see right through you.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{you do?}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{i hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. it's going to get you into trouble.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{well, you don't have to get nasty about it.}
<A>__{sebastian approaches a photo on her desk and picks it up.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{my daughter, rachel.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{yummy.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{don't even think about it. rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending princeton this fall. she's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{really? care to make a wager on that?}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{good luck, sebastian.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{what, nervous i'm going to win?}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{would you please leave.}
<A>__{sebastian puts on his glasses and leaves.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum }
<D>__{asshole.}
<A>__{the doctor stews for a moment, then reaches into her desk, sifts through some papers where she finds a pack of benson & hedges and lights one up. she looks at the photo of her daughter, then hits the speaker phone and dials.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum }
<D>__{rachel, it's mom.}
