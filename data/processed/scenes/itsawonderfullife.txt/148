<L>__{interior hall night}
<B>__{medium close shot george starts up the stairs}
<A>__{the knob on the banister comes off in his hand, and for a moment he has an impulse to hurl it into the living room. then, he replaces the knob, and goes on up the stairs.}
<L>__{interior zuzu's bedroom night}
<B>__{full shot}
<A>__{the sound of janie at the piano can be heard, the same monotonous rhythm over and over. zuzu (aged six) is sitting up in her bed, the lamp burning beside her. she is holding her prize flower. george tiptoes in. then, as he sees she's awake, he comes over, sitting on the edge of her bed.}
<C>__{zuzu}
<D>__{hi, daddy.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well, what happened to you?}
<C>__{zuzu}
<D>__{i won a flower.}
<A>__{she starts to get out of bed.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{wait now. where do you think you're going?}
<C>__{zuzu}
<D>__{want to give my flower a drink.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{all right, all right. here, give daddy the flower. i will give it a drink.}
<A>__{she shakes her head and presses the flower to her. a few petals fall off. she picks them up.}
<C>__{zuzu}
<D>__{look, daddy... paste it.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yeah, all right. now, i will paste this together.}
<A>__{she hands him the fallen petals and the flower. he turns his back to zuzu, pretending to be tinkering with the flower. he sticks the fallen petals in his watch pocket, rearranges the flower, and then turns back to zuzu.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{there it is, good as new.}
<C>__{zuzu}
<D>__{give the flower a drink.}
<A>__{george puts the flower in a glass of water on the table beside her bed.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{now, will you do something for me?}
<B>__{closeup george and zuzu}
<A>__{they whisper.}
<C>__{zuzu}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{will you try to get some sleep?}
<C>__{zuzu}
<D>__{i'm not sleepy. i want to look at my flower.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i know i know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.}
<C>__{zuzu}
<D>__{it will?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<A>__{she closes her eyes and relaxes on the bed. george pulls the covers over her. he bends down and his lips touch a tendril of the child's hair. then he gets up and tiptoes out of the room.}
