<L>__{interior basement later}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{and now, direct from three weeks of rehearsal in walter's garage, four guys who have dedicated their lives to becoming the greatest singing}
<P>__{group in the world... (beat)}
<D>__{charlie, walter, leon and terry. the definitions.}
<A>__{applause as the group enters from the furnace room. they all wear black pants and iridescent sharkskin jackets. charlie is in the center of the group as they position themselves.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{one, two, three ...}
<A>__{the group begins to sing an a capella version of rama lama ding dong (or i wonder why). charlie sings lead, backed up by the other three. walter dances insane, temptationlike steps. the crowd huddles around them, clapping and grooving. peggy is on the planet of lost innocence, removed and melancholy.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{charlie really has a great voice.}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{maybe they'll be the next dion and the belmonts.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{don't get your hopes up.}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{come on, where's your enthusiasm?}
<A>__{charlie sings directly to peggy, grinning at her. in spite of herself, she smiles back at him. she's starting to realize why she fell in love with him. he's irresistible.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{he is kind of cute, isn't he?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{yeah. you're so lucky. he really loves you, too. he's always telling walter how wonderful you are.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{he does?}
<A>__{the group finishes the song. charlie blows peggy a kiss. the crowd applauds, including peggy. dolores joins peggy, carol and maddy.}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{carol and i saw you with that creep, richard, today.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{first of all, richard is not a creep. he happens to be an exceptional person. if any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{god, peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. you're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? you don't even know the boy. if you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{are you for real?}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{touchy, touchy!}
<A>__{dolores storms away.}
<C>__{maddy}
<P>__{(to peggy)}
<D>__{i don't know what you said to her, but i wish i'd said it.}
<A>__{charlie and walter walk over and accept "bravos" from the girls. walter does his james dean imitation.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{charlie, what do you think of richard norvik?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{he's trying.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hey! who needs physics when we've got chemistry?}
<C>__{peggy}
<P>__{(charmed)}
<D>__{come on, let's dance.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{put on some makeout music, and kill the lights.}
<A>__{we hear a record scratch. a slow song begins. the lights are dimmed. coupler begin to slow dance. charlie holds peggy close, barely moving. peggy is mistyeyed, moved by being in charlie's arms again.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{there isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{you're pretty charming when you want to be.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah i know. but i don't have to flatter you. it just feels right. you're the perfect girl for me. as in is, was and always will be. i'm glad dancing was invented. you know the first dances were rituals. like fertility rites.}
<A>__{as they dance charlie gets embarrassed by an erection, and moves his hips away from peggy. she surprises him by grabbing his tush and pulling him into her.}
