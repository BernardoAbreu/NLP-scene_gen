<D>__{your excellency!}
<A>__{count dooku turns as obi wan and anakin run in through the hanger doors. they draw their lightsabers. the droids raise their weapons.}
<C>__{count dooku}
<D>__{that won't be necessary, captain. stand down. and leave them to me.}
<A>__{the droids lower their weapons and back off to the walls. count dooku looks at obi wan and anakin with slight amusement.}

<D>__{i'm taking him now! obi wan anakin, no!}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{you'll pay for all the jedi you've killed today, dooku.}
<A>__{anakin charges across the open space at count dooku, who smiles faintly, watching him come. anakin raises his lightsaber. at the last moment, count dooku thrusts out an arm, and anakin is lifted up, hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. he slumps to the foot of the wall, semi conscious. count dooku moves toward obi wan}
<C>__{count dooku}
<D>__{kenobi, isn't it? as you can see, my jedi powers are far beyond yours. now, back down. obi wan i don't think so.}
<A>__{obi wan lifts his lightsaber. count dooku smiles.}
<C>__{count dooku}
<D>__{ah, but if i must.}
<A>__{count dooku draws his lightsaber. he and obi wan start to circle each other.}
<C>__{count dooku}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i have spent the last ten years learning to use the power of the dark side. it gives me infinitely greater power. obi wan you will have to prove it.}
<A>__{obi wan comes in fast, swinging at count dooku's head. dooku parries the cut easily. as they fight, it quickly becomes clear that dooku is the complete swordsman elegant, graceful, classical a master of the old style.}
<C>__{count dooku}
<D>__{grand master kenobi, you disappoint me. yoda holds you in such high esteem.}
<A>__{count dooku parried another cut.}
<C>__{count dooku}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{surely you can do better...?}
<P>__{(parries)}
<D>__{no, i'm surprised. has jedi swordsmanship degenerated so quickly, or are you trying to make fun of me?}
<P>__{(cuts)}
<D>__{which is it?}
<A>__{count dooku thrusts. obi wan steps back quickly, panting for breath.}
<C>__{count dooku}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{come, come, master kenobi. put me out of my misery.}
<A>__{obi wan takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again. for a moment, he drives count dooku back. then dooku's superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces obi wan to retreat. count dooku increases the tempo of his attack. obi wan is pushed to the limit to defend himself. dooku presses. his lightsaber flashes. obi wan is wounded in the shoulder, then the thigh. he stumbles back against the wall, trips, and falls. his lightsaber goes skittering across the floor. count dooku raises his lightsaber. obi wan looks up helplessly. dooku's lightsaber flashes down and clashes against anakin's lightsaber! count dooku and anakin stare eyeball to eyeball.}
<C>__{count dooku}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{that's brave of you, boy but foolish. i would have thought you'd have learnt your lesson.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i'm a slow learner.}
<A>__{and anakin charges at count dooku. the force of his attack catches the count slightly off balance. anakin's lightsaber flashes. count dooku draws back, putting a hand to his arm. he takes the hand away and looks at the smear of blood whee anakin has nicked him.}
<C>__{count dooku}
<D>__{you have unusual powers, young padawan. but not enought to save you this time.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{don't bet on it! obi wan anakin!}
<A>__{obi wan uses the force to catch his lightsaber and he tosses it to anakin. with two lightsabers, anakin attacks. count dooku parries and ripostes. it is no contest. anakin is driven back against the wall. he loses one lightsaber. finally count dooku, in one flashing move, sends anakin's arm, cut at the elbow, flying still gripping his lightsaber. anakin drops to the ground in agony. count dooku draws himself up to deliver the coup de grace. suddenly, the great doors slide open. the droids turn fast, raising their weapons. through the thick smoke, emerges the heroic figure of yoda. he stops on the smoke filled threashold, four droids lined up on either side of him, guns pointed. before the droids can get off a shot, yoda raises his hand, and the droids are flung against the far walls and crash to the floor in heaps of smoking metal. silence. count dooku steps away from anakin to face the jedi grand master. his lightsaber whirls in a formal salute.}
<C>__{count dooku}
<D>__{master yoda. at last we shall know who is the most powerful.}
<A>__{yoda draws a miniature lightsaber out of his cane. he salutes formally.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{count dooku. no interest in contests, do i have.}
<A>__{count dooku charges across the space at yoda. he rains down blows upon the tiny figure. yoda doesn't budge an inch. for the first part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that dooku aims. nothing the great swordsman tries gets through. his energy drains. his strokes become feebler, slower. yoda attacks! he flies forward. count dooku is forced to retreat. wprds are insufficient to describe the range and skill of yoda's speed and swordplay. his lightsaber his a humming blur of light. count dooku's lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand. he staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel. yoda jumps onto dooku's shoulders, and is about to drive the lightsaber into the top of the count's head.}

<D>__{the end for you, count, this is.}
<C>__{count dooku}
<D>__{...not yet...}
<A>__{count dooku raises his arms and knocks yoda off his shoulders and then, with all his might, he uses the force to pull on one of the cranes in the hanger. it comes crashing down on obi wan and anakin. but in the blink of and eye, yoda is under the crane, holding it up, using the force. yoda closes his eyes and concentrates. anakin is unconscious, and obi0wan tries toget out from under the crane. the fallen crane trembles and starts to life. behind it, the sound of the sail ship's engines are heard starting up. yoda concentrates harder. slowly, the crane rises. the sound of the engines increases. yoda exerts every scrap of his powers. the crane lifts clear of anakin and is thrown to the ground. dooku's sail ship takes off. obi wan and anakin struggle to the exhausted yoda, but it's too late. the sail ship rises into the air and flies away. padme and a clone captain with about ten troopers appear in the doorway.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{anakin!}
<A>__{padme runs too him and throws her arms around him. anakin is barely able to stand up. the clone captain marches up to yoda, stops, and salutes smartly.}
<C>__{clone captain}
<D>__{resistance is at an end, general. what are your orders ?}
<A>__{yoda looks at him and sighs.}
