<L>__{interior blue door fight club night}
<A>__{superimpose over action... "november 12, 1975 philadelphia" ... the club itself resembles a large unemptied trash can. the boxing ring is extra small to insure constant battle. the lights overhead have barely enough wattage to see who is fighting. in the ring are two heavyweights, one white the other black. the white fighter is rocky balboa. he is thirty years old. his face is scarred and thick around the nose... his black hair shines and hangs in his eyes. rocky fights in a plodding, machine like style. the black fighter dances and bangs combinations into rocky's face with great accuracy. but the punches do not even cause rocky to blink... he grins at his opponent and keeps grinding ahead. the people at ringside sit on folding chairs and clamor for blood... they lean out of their seats and heckle the fighters. in the thick smoke they resemble spectres. everyone is hustling bets... the action is even heavier in the balcony. a housewife yells for somebody to cover a two dollar bet. the bell rings and the fighters return to their corner... somebody heaves a beer can into the ring. the black fighter spits something red in a bucket and sneers across the ring at rocky.}

<A>__{the bell rings... rocky makes the sign of the cross. the fighters engage in battle. the other fighter grabs rocky in a clinch and purposely butts him... the butt opens a bleeding cut on the corner of rocky's eye. rocky becomes furious over the foul and drives a flurry into the man's body... rocky slams the man on the jaw and the fighter is out for the night. the fans throw rubbish into the ring. rocky ignores it. the fans loudly go about collecting bets. the referee does not bother to even count the fighter out and drags him under the ropes where he is placed on a stretcher. two new fighters enter the ring. rocky slips on a tattered robe. embroidered clumsily on the back is, "the italian stallion."}
<C>__{announcer}
<D>__{winner, rocky balboa next a six rounder between local lightweights.}
<A>__{without pomp rocky climbs out of the ring and bums a cigarette from a spectator... the fighter on the stretcher passes behind him. he watches for a moment and continues up the aisle... before he even reaches the rear of the club the bell rings and the next fight has already begun... rocky fades into the darkness of the rear of the club.}
