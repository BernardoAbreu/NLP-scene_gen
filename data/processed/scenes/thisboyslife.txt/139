<L>__{interior school workshop day}
<A>__{toby is working with a table saw. suddenly a two inch thick manilla envelope plops down beside him. he looks up to see arthur standing beside him. glancing around to see that he's unobserved, he checks the contents of the envelope: we see school stationery, blank transcript forms, and a stack of official envelopes. toby closes his eyes. he's saved.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{you could leave too, you know.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{no, i've grown progressively fond of concrete. i think i will stay here all alone and dress up in my mama's old clothes sometimes like you said.}
<A>__{arthur turns and swishes away. toby pats the manilla envelope, turns back to the saw. suddenly he jerks, looks down, and sees that the ring finger of his left hand is spurting blood. toby says a mild, astonished "hey," and sinks to his knees.}
