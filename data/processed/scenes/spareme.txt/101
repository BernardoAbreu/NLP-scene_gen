<L>__{exterior miles 'o' lanes parking lot day}
<A>__{the sign has been changed to "sheila's alley." a sparkling new badass super chromed vespa is parked in the handicap zone. the barbie and ken dolls are wired to the headlamp. they look incredibly worse for the wear. a parking ticket is nestled between them. theo's car pulls in nearby.}

<A>__{theo walks through the doors and into the alley packed with serious bowling types. as he walks towards the back of the alley, several bowlers stop bowling and stare at him in awe.}

<D>__{theo! howya doin'?}
<A>__{theo walks on. others greet the conquering hero.}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{theo! hey, theo's back!}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{hello there, stranger.}
<C>__{little girl}
<P>__{(still crying)}
<D>__{waaaaaaaaaaah!}
<A>__{at the far end, we see sheila, dressed in a fitted jogging suit, bowling alone on her lane. bowlers stop and hold their balls at their sides. sheila notices the whole alley is silent. theo steps up to the lane, bowling ball bag in hand. as he straps on his wristbrace he peers down the lane and sees a seven ten split; mule ears.}
