<T>__{cut to jim garrison:}
<A>__{'s office new orleans same day (1963) pause. the lovely old china clock on the wall reads 12:35. somewhere a car backfires. we see a close up of the clock moving to 12:36. we hear the sound of a pen on paper, scratching... we see a shot of jim garrison as a young air pilot in world war ii; hear the sound of airplanes. the camera moves to framed photos of jim as a young, lincolnesque lawyer... we hear sounds of political rallies, cheering... a shot of jim's grandfather shaking hands with president william taft. the sound of bulldozers carries us to a shot of jim staring at piles of decaying corpses at dachau... a photo of clarence darrow... a law degree and an appointment as district attorney of the new orleans parish... mother garrison with young jim on the desk... another family his own. we look across the thick desk with the chess set, a complete works of william shakespeare and a nazi helmet with a bullet hole in it... to jim himself writing pen to paper. we sense the quiet intellect of the 43 year old man. the clock ticks in the awful suspended silence. it's as if the air itself has been sucked from the silent room. this is the last moment of peace before the world will rush through the door in all its sound and fury to change his life forever. the camera haywires into a close up of jim as he looks up... and knows. lou ivon, jim's chief investigator, is already standing there in the room. he is burly, in his 30s his expression universal for that day.}

<A>__{there are sounds of shock, muttering, some sobbing in the restaurant. lou gulps down his drink. jim sits stunned.}
<C>__{jim}

<A>__{he holds back the tears. the food comes. lou waves it off. they just sit there.}
