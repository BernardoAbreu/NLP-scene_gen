<A>__{serene music of the italian baroque pergolesi's stabat mater sung by a choir of boys with organ accompaniment. we see the outside of the 17th century church sitting in the wide landscape of lombardy: sunlit fields, a dusty, white road, poplar trees.}

<A>__{the music continues and swells. we see the twelve year old salieri seated between his plump and placid parents in the congregation, listening in rapture. his father is a heavy looking, self approving man, obviously indifferent to the music. a large and austere christ on the cross hangs over the altar. candles burn below his image.}

<D>__{even then a spray of sounded notes could make me dizzy, almost to falling.}
<A>__{the boy falls forward on his knees. so do his parents and the other members of the congregation. he stares up at christ who stares back at him.}
<C>__{old salieri }
<D>__{whilst my father prayed earnestly to god to protect commerce, i would offer up secretly the proudest prayer a boy could think of. lord, make me a great composer! let me celebrate your glory through music and be celebrated myself! make me famous through the world, dear god! make me immortal! after i die let people speak my name forever with love for what i wrote! in return i vow i will give you my chastity my industry, my deepest humility, every hour of my life. and i will help my fellow man all i can. amen and amen!}
<A>__{the music swells to a crescendo. the candles flare. we see the christ through the flames looking at the boy benignly.}
<C>__{old salieri }
<D>__{and do you know what happened? a miracle!}
