<L>__{interior harvey's cubicle v.a. hospital 1980's day}
<A>__{harvey scratches his head.}
<B>__{close up on his doodling}
<A>__{harvey writes "i got a job" in a balloon over the stick figure's head.}
<C>__{real harvey }
<D>__{so to stave off desperation and feelings of uselessness i resigned myself to a menial existence. but hey, maybe the guy who's had a happy life feels worse just before he dies than th' guy who had a sad one. or, maybe not. i dunno. maybe i just needed a woman.}
<A>__{toby comes in, decked out in plaid and stripes. he has an empty messenger bag.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{hi, harvey. do you want these gourmet jelly beans? i gave up sweets for lent.}
<A>__{harvey turns around. he seems down, depressed.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{huh? sure, i will take 'em.}
<A>__{toby watches harvey eat a few.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{hey, watermelon. that's pretty good.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i recommend the pina coladas. they are excellent and very authentic tasting.}
<A>__{toby heads down a file row and proceeds to take a few off the shelves, stuffing his bag. harvey gets up and comes after him.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{hey toby, can you eat lentils during lent?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{sure. i don't see why not. you can't eat meat on certain days, but lentils should be acceptable anytime.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{ya think there's any connection between lentils and lent?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i don't think so but i will ask sister mary fred at church on sunday.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{sister mary fred, huh? is she cute? sounds kinda mannish but who am i to be picky.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{harvey, you're funny. she's a nun.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{so what? maybe she became a nun because she couldn't get a guy.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{harvey, she became a nun because she had a higher calling.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{higher calling. that is such a crock of shit. i don't know why you waste your time prayin' anyway.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{well, harvey, i like the ritual. and i'm a very spiritual person. you know, you should try believing in something bigger than yourself. it might cheer you up.}
<A>__{toby turns on his heels and walks off.}
<C>__{harvey}
<P>__{(calling after him)}
<D>__{what? do i seem depressed, toby?}
<A>__{toby doesn't respond. harvey shrugs and digs deep into the jelly bean bag. he pulls out a fistful. close on harvey's hand jellybeans in every imaginable color. harvey fingers a few and then picks a blue one.}
<C>__{bob the director }
<D>__{cut!}
