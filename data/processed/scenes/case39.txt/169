<L>__{exterior emily's house night}
<A>__{smoke swirling past her, she exits the house, locking the front door behind her. she backs away and watches it burn, holding her fish tank, the only thing she saved.}
<T>__{time cut to:}
<A>__{billowing black smoke. the house fully engulfed as fire engines arriving on the scene, sirens wailing. emily watching with neighbors on the sidewalk as the firefighters uncoil their hoses. the window to lucy's bedroom is a bright red square, an inferno. and as emily stares at it, disbelieving what she's done, the figure of a child appears.}
<C>__{lucy}
<A>__{her whole body ablaze. horrific. she just stands there, arms at her sides, burning. just now the fire marshall crosses to the onlookers. hollers over the noise and commotion:}
<C>__{fire marshall}
<D>__{everybody get out okay?!}
<A>__{emily wavers, not sure what to say. the fire marshall sees her indecision.}
<C>__{fire marshall}
<D>__{this your house?!}
<P>__{(she nods yes)}
<D>__{anybody else inside?!}
<P>__{(off her hesitation)}
<D>__{ma'am...?!}
<A>__{emily opens her mouth to reply, but sees something behind her that closes her throat.}
<C>__{lucy}
<A>__{standing on the sidewalk in her pajamas. unscathed.}
<C>__{fire marshall}
<D>__{anyone else inside?! yes or no?!}
<A>__{emily, in shock, shakes her head no. the fire marshall rushes off, walkie talkie squawking. emily stands frozen as lucy comes through the crowd to her. more dismayed than angry.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{that was mean.}
<A>__{she takes emily's hand. together they watch the house burn. firelight playing on their faces. the fish bouncing off the glass in the tank at emily's feet.}
