<A>__{a rainstorm over the freak show. we pass along the row of freak wagons. these freaks truly deserve the name. they are quite different from the rather domestic ones we saw in the circus in england. these are not fakes. a rope cordons us off from them. the audience, which we see all around us, is enjoying the freaks, but there is a sense of vulgarity in their gaiety. they seem hard, and cold and jaded. we move by pinheads, a hermaphrodite and a legless wonder. some siamese twins are playing cat's cradle. past them runs a dwarf with a plumed hat playing a small flute. trailing behind him on a string is a small wooden ark on wheels. a lionfaced man is combing the hair that covers his face. a rubber man pulls the skin of his neck up over his face. there is a fairly big crowd standing around a tall man, affectionately rubbing the small parasitic twin, growing out of his chest. the barker owners compete with each other and the occasional thunder. finally we hear the patter of bytes, telling of the horrible fate of john merrick's mother on that african isle so many years ago. a very big crowd is listening to him. they are looking at the poster at the back of the wagon, waiting impatiently to see the elephant man.}

<D>__{...the result is plain to see. ladies and gentlemen... the terrible elephant man!}
<A>__{he raps twice with merrick's silver tipped walking stick and pulls the poster up. merrick is standing unsteadily in the wagon. he is quite sick. the audience gasps and shudders. a few shrieks are heard. the elephant man is always the elephant man.}

<D>__{turn around!}
<A>__{merrick slowly turns around, the audience gasping at the sight of the horrible tumors. bytes raps the walking stick twice.}

<D>__{dance!}
<A>__{merrick begins a series of awkward movements, his pained version of a dance. without his walking stick it is very difficult for him, but he strives to do it. some of the crowd laughs at this, others shudder at the strange sight. suddenly merrick falters and comes to a stop, breathing irregularly. seeing this, bytes goes to him and bringing the stick behind merrick, out of view of the audience, jabs him savagely in the back.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{dance!}
<A>__{merrick groans with pain and some of the people in the first row flinch back. merrick begins to dance again as people throw coins onto the stage, which the boy gathers and puts into a cap.}
