<A>__{will and lambeau work together at the board. they communicate non verbally as they collaborate on a problem. after a particularly amusing series of numbers, they share a look and laugh.}

<A>__{will and sean sit in silence. a long moment passes. sean casually reclines in his chair, disinterested. will restlessly looks around the room and then back to sean. an odd half smile crosses sean's face. after a moment:}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you know, i was on this plane once. and i'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like "we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. then he says "man, all i want right now is a blow job and a cup of coffee." so the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes "don't forget the coffee!"}
<C>__{sean}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{you've never been on a plane.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i know, but the joke's better if i tell it in the first person.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i have been laid you know.}
<A>__{sean smiles.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{yeah? you got a lady now?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{yeah, i went on a date last week.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{how'd it go?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{well, are you going out again?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{haven't called her.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{jesus christ, you are an amateur.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i know what i'm doing. she's different from the other girls i met. we have a really good time. she's smart, beautiful, fun...}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{so christ, call her up.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{why? so i can realize she's not so smart. that she's boring. you don't get it. right now she's perfect, i don't want to ruin that.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{and right now you're perfect too. maybe you don't want to ruin that.}
<A>__{will says nothing.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{well, i think that's a great philosophy will, that way you can go through your entire life without ever having to really know anybody.}
<A>__{sean looks directly at will, who looks away. a beat.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{my wife used to turn the alarm clock off in her sleep. i was late for work all the time because in the middle of the night she'd roll over and turn the damn thing off. eventually i got a second clock and put it under my side of the bed, but it got to where she was gettin' to that one too. she was afraid of the dark, so the closet light was on all night. thing kept me up half the night. eventually i'd fall asleep, out of sheer exhaustion and not wake up when i was supposed to cause she'd have already gotten to my alarms.}
<A>__{will smiles, sean takes a beat.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{my wife's been dead two years, will. and when i think about her, those are the things i think about most. little idiosyncrasies that only i knew about. those made her my wife. and she had the goods on me too. little things i do out of habit. people call these things imperfections will. it's just who we are. and we get to choose who we're going to let into out weird little worlds. you're not perfect. and let me save you the suspense, this girl you met isn't either. the question is, whether or not you're perfect for each other. you can know everything in the world, but the only way you're findin' that one out is by giving it a shot. you sure won't get the answer from an old fucker like me. and even if i did know, i wouldn't tell you.}
<A>__{will smiles. a beat.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{why not? you told me every other fuckin' thing. you talk more than any shrink i ever met.}
<A>__{sean laughs.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i teach this shit, i didn't say i knew how to do it.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you ever think about gettin' remarried?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{my wife's dead.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{hence, the word remarried.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{my wife's dead.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{well i think that's a wonderful philosophy, sean. that way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.}
<A>__{a beat. sean smiles.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{time's up.}
