<L>__{interior grocery store night}
<A>__{will shakes a shopping cart free from the pile up while his mother checks her list.}
<B>__{at the produce section}
<A>__{sandra starts to bag string beans.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{mom, would you say you understand dad?}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what i mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{how is that possible? i mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.}
<P>__{(decidedly)}
<D>__{you can't honestly say you know him.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{yes, will, i do. and don't presume things you don't know.}
<A>__{she's more amused than annoyed, but will is entering dangerous territory.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{would you say you understand josephine?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{yes. but that's a different...}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{no it's not. it's exactly the same. your father and i met, we dated, and we married we chose each other because we understood each other on some fundamental level. just the same as you two.}
<A>__{she moves on to the carrots.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{josephine and i have a lot in common.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{yes, you both think william bloom is a very smart man.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. and i've been his wife longer than i've been your mother. you can't discount that.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{true. but i've known him my whole life, and i don't feel like i know him at all. or ever will.}
<A>__{with a look, sandra acknowledges the stakes.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{i know it's not easy. just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. you just ended up together. you could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. if you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{but i understand you, mom. i always have.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{well, clearly you don't. but i'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.}
