<L>__{interior stan's room later}
<A>__{they are now on their backs staring at the ceiling. they look happy and worn out their p.o.v. those little glow in the dark star stickers are all over the ceiling. there's barely any glow left. stan lets out a big sigh as he looks at the "stars"...}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{that was amazing. i mean, like, totally and exceptionally, over the top, amazing.}
<A>__{zoe turns to him. takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{stan.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{there's something i really have to tell you.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{there's something i have to tell you, too.}
<A>__{now stan turns to her. they are face to face.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{can i go first? `cause if we're going to say the same thing, i want to say it first.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{we're not going to say the same thing.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{well, let me go, because this is really embarrassing, and i just have to say it.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i've dated a lot of women. i mean, not tons, but a lot. and, the thing is, i've never...been in love before. i've never even told anyone i love them before. because i just never felt it. but from the day we met, from the first time our backs accidentally touched in the subway, i feel this, this...}
<P>__{(he shakes his head)}
<D>__{maybe this is too much to say right now, but...i love you, zoe. i really do.}
<A>__{stan finishes. he looks at her and smiles. zoe just stares at him.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{in my mind, you were supposed to say, i love you, too.}
<A>__{instead, zoe covers her mouth and runs to the bathroom. a beat later, we hear her vomit.}
