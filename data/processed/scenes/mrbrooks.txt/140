<L>__{exterior street n night}
<A>__{on the sidewalk mr. smith is walking toward the on coming traffic. the headlights make it difficult to tell one car from the other until they pass. that doesn't keep him from looking for mr. brooks. the houses stop and he's passing a pocket park. in a dark space between the street lamps, a hand falls on mr. smith's shoulder. he jumps and a scream squeaks out of his throat. it's mr. brooks, in his pottery throwing clothes.}

<D>__{are you ready to rock and roll, mr. smith?}
<A>__{mr. smith swallows hard and nods. mr. brooks propels him into the park.}
