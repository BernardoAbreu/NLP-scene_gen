<D>__{you met mickey knox, didn't you?}
<C>__{jessie}
<D>__{yeah, i visited him when he was up in susanville. he's a little cerebral for my taste, but all in all, we got along.}
<L>__{interior office day}
<A>__{wayne, sitting in a chair in front of a desk, interviews dr. reinghold, who sits behind the desk.}
<C>__{wayne }
<D>__{to get a psychiatric view on the strange attraction mickey and mallory seems to have, we talked with doctor emil reinghold, noted psychologist and author.}
<A>__{wayne begins his interview.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{can you shed some light, doctor reinghold, on why the public has taken a pair of sociopaths so close to their bosom?}
<C>__{dr. reinghold}
<D>__{well, for one, the media has done a tremendous job of turning the husband and wife mass murderers into celebrities. but it's the country's youth who have turned the couple into the ultimate anti heroes. basically, the very thing that makes them most lethal is the exact same thing that captures the public's hearts and minds mickey and mallory's operatic devotion to each other. in a world where people can't seem to make the simplest relationships work and the slightest emotional commitment is considered devastating, mick and mallory have a do or die romance of a shakespearean magnitude. to the country's youth, 75 percent of which are coming from broken homes, that's appealing. they have an 'us against the world' posture which always appeals to youth. and they've taken that posture seventeen steps beyond. it's not 'us against the world,' it's 'we're gonna kill the world.' they're exciting. i read their file and i find myself turning the page like it was a paperback. why do disillusioned youths get into mickey and mallory? why do disillusioned housewives read romance novels? why are you filming this special? because you know as well as i do, you say 'tonight at nine charles manson speaks,' everybody's going to tune in to hear what he says. mickey and mallory have shocked a country numb with violence. they've created a world where only two exist and anybody who inadvertently enters that world is murdered.}
