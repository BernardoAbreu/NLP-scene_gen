<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{claudia is intent on looking at sandro who is doing the driving. the car is traveling on a country road but claudia shows no interest in the landscape. she continues to stare at sandro as if she wants to know his most secret thoughts. suddenly, feeling himself being stared at, sandro turns towards claudia. she quickly drops her gaze. then sandro turns his eyes back to the road, and claudia looks up at him again. from a bend in the road up ahead, preceded by the loud and penetrating blast of a horn, the bus mentioned earlier by the storekeeper appears. sandro barely manages to stop the car in time off to one side of the road. he gets out and places himself in the middle of the road where he starts signaling for the bus to stop. with a loud screech of its brakes, the bus comes to a stop almost directly in front of him. the bus driver opens the window and leans out.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{did your car break down?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{no. i only want some information.}
<A>__{meanwhile, the driver's assistant gets down from the bus and the passengers lean out of the windows. claudia has also gotten out of the car and appears on the scene.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{we're searching for a girl of about twenty five... seems she boarded this bus two days ago, in the afternoon... you should remember her because she was a stranger around here...}
<A>__{the driver gets down from the bus and comes over to sandro, scratching his head.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{she was a little nervous... dark haired ... with a kerchief around her head?}
<A>__{he turns to his assistant for verification, who, in turn, searches his memory and then adds:}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{two days ago... wasn't there that midwife on the bus, too? sure, that's right, and she was talking to some young woman ...}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{can you tell me where she got off?}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{all i can tell you is that the midwife is from x...}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{okay, thanks.}
<A>__{sandro turns and goes back to his car while the others climb back on the bus which begins to leave. claudia and sandro remain standing near the car, watching the bus disappear. then claudia turns and looks out over the fields. she sees a dry riverbed filled with stones that sparkle in the sun, beside it a high rocky bank. sandro stands next to her and she becomes vividly aware of his presence. as she glances at him, he turns around, then she quickly starts up a conversation as though she were anxious not to have any romantic mood develop between them.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{my god ... let's hope it was her.}
<A>__{then, still feeling sandro's eyes fixed upon her, she turns and starts heading towards the car. sandro catches up with her and takes her hand. before they climb into the car they look at each other intensely. a moment later, the car takes off at full speed.}
