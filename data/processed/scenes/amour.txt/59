<L>__{interior kitchen adjoining bedroom hallway day}
<A>__{georges is seated at the kitchen table where he had breakfast with anne in scene 8, and writes a letter. pauses for reflection. gentle cooing of pigeons, scarcely audible. suddenly, georges starts. at the far end of the long kitchen, beside the door between the kitchen units, a pigeon is walking. georges stares at it. for a long time. then he gets up slowly and, via the door located beside the kitchen table, he goes into the adjoining room. on the sofa there, he has set up his new bed. he takes the wool blanket from the bed and comes back into the kitchen, carefully approaches the pigeon that then runs off in alarm. georges carefully opens up the blanket and finally throws it over the pigeon. but it manages to escape into the hallway. georges follows it. this action is repeated several times. the pigeon is more and more panicky, starts to fly up, flutters about in all directions. georges closes the light well window to cut off its escape route. this lasts an exhausting amount of time, but he ends up capturing it. he cuddles it against him, rolled up in the blanket, leans against a wall, then holds it as if it were a baby.}
