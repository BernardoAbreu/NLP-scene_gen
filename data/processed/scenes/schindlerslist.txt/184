<A>__{schindler leafing through the page of names, counting them, drinking, to the sound of the typewriter. eventually, quietly to himself }
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{that's it.}
<A>__{stern heard him and stops typing, glances over.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{you can finish that page.}
<A>__{stern resumes where he left off, but then hesitates again. there's something he doesn't understand.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{what did goeth say? you just told him how many you needed?}
<A>__{it doesn't sound right. and schindler doesn't answer. he's avoided telling stern the details of the deal struck with goeth, and balks telling him now. finally awkwardly }
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i'm buying them. i'm paying him. i give him money, he gives me the people.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{if you were still working for me i'd expect you to talk me out of it, it's costing me a fortune.}
<A>__{stern had no idea. and has no idea now what to say. schindler shrugs like it's no big deal, but stern knows it is.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{give him the list, he'll sign it, he'll get the people ready. i have to go back to brinnlitz, to take care of things on that end, i will see you there.}
<A>__{stern is really overcome by what this man is doing. what he can't figure out is why. silence. and then }
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{finish the page.}
<A>__{stern turns back, does as he's told. schindler drinks. nothing but the sound of the typewriter keys. and then nothing at all. the page is done. the rest will die.}
