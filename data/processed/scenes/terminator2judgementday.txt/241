<A>__{a103 exterior compound behind the trailers there is an aging and rusted caterpillar sitting behind one of the trailers. john expertly backs it toward terminator who is holding one end of a piece of heavy chain which disappears into the sand.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hook it on.}
<A>__{terminator hooks the chain onto the towhook on the back of the tractor. john hits the throttle and the cat churns its treads, pulling some massive load. a six by eight foot sheet of steel plate moves slowly under six inches of sand. john drags it far enough to reveal... a rectangular hole in the ground. like the mouth of a tomb. the kid drops down from the tractor and walks to the hole.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{one thing about my mom... she always plans ahead.}
<A>__{a104 interior weapons cache from inside the "tomb". sunlight slashes down into a cinder block room, less than six feet wide but over twenty long. sand spills down the steps. the walls are lined with guns. john precedes terminator into sarah's weapons cache. rifles, pistols, rocket launchers, mortars, rpgs, radio gear. at the far end, boxes containing ammo, grenades, etc. are stacked to the ceiling. terminator gets real alert. scanning, wondering where to begin. he picks up a mac 10 machine pistol. racks the bolt.}

<D>__{excellent.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yeah, i thought you'd like this place.}
<A>__{a105 exterior compound nearby sarah emerges from a trailer. she has changed. boots, black fatigue pants, t shirt. shades. she looks hard. salceda is nearby, packing food and other survival equipment with yolanda. he looks up as sarah approaches, and slaps the side of a big four by bronco next to him,}
<C>__{salceda}
<D>__{this is the best truck, but the water pump is blown. you got the time to change it out?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{yeah. i'm gonna wait till dark to cross the border.}
<P>__{(she pulls him away from yolanda)}
