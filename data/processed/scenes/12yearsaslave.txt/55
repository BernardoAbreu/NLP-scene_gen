<L>__{interior freeman's great room day}
<A>__{we come in on an odd sort of sight; a jumble of activity. customers have come to see freeman's lot the room all gussied up with flowers. freeman moves among them, displaying them as a rancher would prize chattel. freeman makes the slaves hold their heads up "look smart" as he previously admonished them. they are made to walk briskly back and forth while customers feel their hands and arms and bodies, turn them about and ask what skills they possess. the customers routinely make the slaves open their mouths and show their teeth. at times a male or female slave are taken off to the side, stripped and inspected more minutely. one of them, john, is stripped and inspected. cape, as he's done previously, plays his fiddle. a buyer william ford; a man of middle age, and an attractive nature in his tone of voice consults a list he's drawn up and asks of freeman:}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{what is the price for the ones platt and eliza?}
<C>__{freeman}
<D>__{a thousand for platt; he is a nigger of talent. seven hundred for eliza. my fairest price.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{you will accept a note?}
<C>__{freeman}
<D>__{as always, from you, mr. ford.}
<A>__{eliza is beside herself as it seems she is about to be separated from her family. she begs of ford:}
<C>__{eliza}
<D>__{please, sir... please don't divide my family. don't take me unless you take my children as well.}
<C>__{freeman}
<D>__{eliza, quiet!}
<C>__{eliza}
<D>__{you will have the most faithful slave in me, sir. the most faithful slave that has ever lived, but i beg that you do not separate us.}
<A>__{a buyer interrupts the skirmish and approaches freeman and delivers coolly, eyeing randall }
<C>__{buyer}
<D>__{your price for the child?}
<C>__{freeman}
<D>__{you see how fit the boy is. like ripe fruit. he will grow into a fine beast.}
<A>__{randall is made to run, and jump by freeman exhibiting his activity and his condition.}
<P>__{freeman (contâ€™d)}
<D>__{six hundred, and that's fair and final.}
<C>__{buyer}
<D>__{done.}
<A>__{he reaches into his waistcoat and retrieves his wallet, counting out six hundred dollars, placing them into the already extended hand of freeman. ford sees the distress and panic in eliza; it visibly touches him. he now tries to buy emily to console her.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{how much for the little girl? you have no need for her. one so young will bring you no profit.}
<C>__{freeman}
<D>__{i will not sell the girl. there's heaps 'n piles of money to be made off her. she is a beauty. one of the regular bloods. none of your thick lipped, bullet headed, cotton picking niggers.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{her child, man. for god's sake, are you not sentimental in the least?}
<C>__{freeman}
<D>__{my sentimentality stretches the length of a coin. do you want the lot, mr. ford, or do you pass on them all?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{i will take the ones platt and eliza.}
<A>__{eliza grips her children tight.}
<C>__{eliza}
<D>__{i will not go without my children. you will not take them from me.}
<A>__{as if to prove her wrong, freeman puts a foot to eliza and harshly kicks her away from emily.}
<C>__{eliza }
<D>__{please, don't. no!}
<A>__{freeman, to cape:}
<C>__{freeman}
<D>__{take her out of here.}
<A>__{cape drops his fiddle, begins to pull eliza away toward the door of the room, but her screaming and pleading do not abate. it is clearly unsettling to the other buyers.}
<C>__{freeman }
<D>__{keep her quiet.}
<A>__{cape tries to muzzle her with his hand, but eliza continues to scream for her children as emily does for her mother.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{mama... mama!}
<C>__{freeman}
<P>__{(to solomon)}
<D>__{play something! get the fiddle and play.}
<A>__{as ordered, solomon takes up cape's fiddle and begins to play lightly.}
<C>__{freeman }
<D>__{play!}
<A>__{solomon plays harder and more loudly. still, it is barely enough to drown out eliza's cries. freeman gets the other slaves to clap along with solomon's playing. emily frees herself and runs back, crying but endeavoring to be strong }
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{don't cry, mama. i will be a good girl. don't cry. i will keep my head up and i will look smart. i will always look smart.}
<C>__{freeman}
<D>__{make merry, all of you! goddamn it, cape! keep her quiet or it's your damned hide i will take it out of!}
<A>__{cape pulls a rag, stuffs it in eliza's mouth. clamping both hands over her mouth, he hauls eliza from the room by the head. it is an ugly, ugly scene.}
