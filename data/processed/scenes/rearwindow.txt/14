<A>__{we now see the source of the piano music. it comes from the apartment with the studio window which we saw earlier where the man was shaving and listening to the radio. the short, balding man sits at the piano playing a few notes, then transferring them by pencil to notepaper on the piano rack. he continues this process, fighting the interference of the ballet music. the opening bars of his melody are beautiful and ear catching. it is slow, hard work, and the ballet music finally becomes such an interference that he gives up and walks to the window to look down toward the dancer's apartment. he stands by a table at the window which is littered with records, the morning coffee cup, unwashed, the remains of breakfast, old newspapers, song sheets, etc. he takes a cigarette out of his mouth, looks for an ash tray, and ends up putting it out in the coffee cup. he then returns to the piano and begins picking out the melody the dancer is playing on her record player.}
