<A>__{watson walks down a dingy hallway towards a door. with a look of resignation, he opens the door to see holmes sitting alone in the sterile, barely furnished room. holmes faces the corner, playing scales on his violin. on the table next to him, an upside down beer stein and an assortment of prescription medicine bottles. watson approaches, sees holmes has bloodshot eyes from lack of sleep. watson picks one of the medicine bottles which is open.}
