<L>__{interior harvey's bedroom 1980's night}
<A>__{a repeat of the opening scene... like a ghost, a naked harvey stands over his bed staring down at a sleeping joyce. in the eerie light, he's almost translucent.}
<C>__{harvey}
<P>__{(faintly)}
<D>__{joyce... joyce?}
<A>__{joyce springs up, alarmed.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{what's wrong, harvey? what are you doing up?}
<A>__{harvey just stands there for a moment saying nothing.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{harvey}
<P>__{(delirious, out of breath)}
<D>__{tell me the truth. am i some guy who writes about himself in a comic book? or am i just just a character in that book?}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{harvey...}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{when i die, will 'dat character keep goin'? or will he just fade away.}
<A>__{joyce just stares at him, unsure how to answer. finally harvey collapses. joyce leaps from the bed, nervous, hysterical. she gets down on the floor and shakes him.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{omigod, harvey! harvey, wake up!}
<A>__{close on harvey's face his eyes remain closed, his expression far, far away. the sound of joyce's voice fades until it seems like a distant echo. then panels from harvey's comics begin to float over his head, his life literally passing before his eyes in comic book form. slowly, the comic images and the unconscious harvey evaporate, giving way to:}
<B>__{green screen a surreal dream sequence}
<A>__{we are now in a large, empty room similar to a blank comic book panel. a healthy, fully dressed harvey appears in the corner of the frame. he is very far away, barely recognizable. we slowly dolly towards him as he delivers a formal soliloquy to the camera:}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{my name is harvey pekar. it's an unusual name harvey pekar...}
<A>__{as harvey speaks, one dimensional comic book images from his life pass over the screen once again. this time in front of him, behind him, everywhere. we dolly in towards him.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{1960 was the year i got my first apartment and my first telephone book. imagine my surprise when i looked up my name and saw that, in addition to me, another harvey pekar was listed!}
<A>__{images of harvey's childhood float by, followed by his young adult years.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{i was listed as harvey l. pekar... my middle name is lawrence... he was listed as harvey pekar no middle initial... therefore, his was a purer listing.}
<A>__{we see harvey age in the images: he's hanging on the street corner with friends, collecting records, hanging with crumb.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{then, in the seventies, i noticed that a third harvey pekar was listed in the phone book! this filled me with curiosity.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{how could there be three people with such an unusual name in the world, let alone in one city?!}
<A>__{now, numerous images of harvey's many years at the v.a. hospital float by: harvey filing, harvey arguing with his boss, harvey and toby, etc.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{then one day, a person i worked with expressed her sympathy to me concerning what she thought was the death of my father. she pointed out an obituary notice in the newspaper for a man named harvey pekar. one of his sons was named harvey. these were the other harvey pekars.}
<A>__{the comic images fade out. harvey is once again alone in the empty room.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{six months later, harvey pekar jr. died. although i'd met neither man, i was filled with sadness. "what were they like," i thought. it seemed that our lives had been linked in some indefinable way.}
<A>__{we slowly move in on his face. extremely close. as close as the camera can get.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{but the story does not end there. for two years later another harvey pekar appeared in the directory. what kind of people are these? where do they come from, what do they do? what's in a name?}
<B>__{end dream sequence}
