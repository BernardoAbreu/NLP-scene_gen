<L>__{interior funeral home. basement corridor day}
<A>__{eliot stops by a thermostat. studies it for a moment. turns it lower. he glances at his watch. takes out his keys from his jacket and moves over to the prep room door.}
<L>__{interior funeral home. prep room moments later}
<A>__{anna sits on the slab. her hands behind her back. she carefully watches eliot as he pulls on his pale blue smock then walks over to a cabinet. behind anna's back her hands clutch the large scissors.}
<B>__{prep room}
<A>__{eliot opens a cabinet full of boxes of hair dye with photographs of smiling women. as he prepares the dye he looks across at anna. she's staring at something behind him. eliot turns. sees the uncovered body of the old woman on the gurney. he quickly walks over. carefully pulls the white sheet over the old woman.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{who is she?}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{mrs. whitehall.}
<A>__{he mixes the dye in a bowl as he moves over to anna.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{you shouldn't be afraid of her. the dead can't harm the dead.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(forcefully)}
<D>__{but i'm not dead!}
<A>__{anna's hand suddenly flies up... she slashes at eliot's face with the scissors. the sharp edge misses his cheek by inches. eliot drops the bowl. stumbles back against the steel trolley. instruments crash to the floor. anna staggers to the door. her legs weak. her long lank hair falling over her eyes. she frantically wrenches at the door handle but it's locked. eliot gets up. slowly moves towards anna. she turns. raises the scissors.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{stay where you are.}
<C>__{eliot}
<P>__{(holds out his hand)}
<D>__{give me the scissors. i only want to help you.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{don't come any closer. i swear to god i will kill you.}
<A>__{eliot walks right up to her. his face now inches from hers.}
<C>__{eliot}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<A>__{anna doesn't move. eliot looks her steadily in the eye. he reaches for her hand. slowly. deliberately. he brings the scissors to his cheek. then lets go of anna's hand. close on eliot's face the sharp tip pushes into his skin.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{go on.}
<B>__{prep room}
<A>__{for a moment we think she might do it. but then she wavers.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{what are you waiting for?}
<A>__{anna's confidence falters. she slowly lowers her hand. the scissors fall onto the floor. anna looks down defeated. her breath labored. suddenly she realizes...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i'm breathing!}
<P>__{(raises her head)}
<D>__{look. i'm still alive!}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{you think you're still alive because you're still attached to life. it's normal. you're just imagining you still have symptoms of life.}
<A>__{she's not listening. eliot takes a roll of paper towels. kneels down, picks up the bowl of dye and mops up the mess.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{maybe i was in some kind of coma. the doctors made a mistake. they're always making mistakes.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{you died. everyone dies.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{how can i be dead if we're talking?}
<A>__{he stands up. sighs wearily.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{we're talking not because you're alive. but because i have a gift.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i can talk to those between life and death.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{to help them make the transition.}
<A>__{anna's stunned. for the first time we sense a seed of doubt in her mind.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{is this what happens when you die?}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{it depends on how you lived your life.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{not everyone needs my help. some let go as soon as their body dies. others don't let go until long after they're in the grave.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{am i a ghost? is that why i'm here?}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{you're here so i can bury you.}
<A>__{anna's silent. trying to make sense of what she's just heard. eliot takes her arm. leads her to the slab.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{come. we've wasted enough time already.}
<A>__{she lies down submissively. suddenly very tired. eliot leans over her to apply what's left of the dye.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{no. please. i don't want }
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{you're a corpse. your opinion doesn't count anymore.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{but i can breathe. i must be alive.}
<A>__{she weakly pushes him away. anger flashes across eliot's face, but just as quickly he controls it.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{you people. you all think that if you breathe, shit, piss you're alive.}
<A>__{anna doesn't know what to say.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{you clutch onto life as if your life was worth clutching onto. was your life worth clutching onto anna?}
<A>__{anna turns her head away. clearly he's struck a chord.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{was it? maybe you died a long time ago.}
<A>__{eliot rips off his latex gloves. tosses them into a bin.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{i have to tell you i'm surprised you're still arguing with me. you don't have much time left.}
<P>__{(gestures to the old women)}
<D>__{look. she's accepted her death. her life has been examined. she has no more regrets. and now she's at peace. she used her time well. you still have so much to learn.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i have nothing to learn!}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<A>__{eliot stands in the doorway. he switches off the light. his body silhouetted by the light from the hallway.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{your funeral's in three days. soon you'll be enclosed in a coffin. then buried in the ground. no one will hear you then. no one will talk to you there.}
<A>__{the door clicks shut behind him. anna doesn't move. clearly unsettled by eliot's words. after a moment she looks at the old woman. she moves over. hesitantly pulls away the white sheet. stares at the old woman curiously. then tentatively touches her cheek.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{are you cold?}
<A>__{she takes the old woman's hand. strokes her paper thin skin.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i'm so cold.}
<A>__{anna notices the old woman's plastic ankle tag.}
<B>__{on plastic ankle tag}
<A>__{name: carol whitehall. sex: f. dob: 11.02.30.}
<B>__{prep room}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you had a long life.}
<A>__{anna turns back. studies the old woman's serene face.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you look so peaceful.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{aren't you scared?}
<A>__{anna's eyes fill with tears.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i'm scared. i'm so scared.}
