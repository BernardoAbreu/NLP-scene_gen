<L>__{interior study diogenes club day}
<A>__{it is a very elegant room shelves of leather bound volumes reach to the high ceiling, there are antique terrestrial and celestial gloves, scientific instruments in polished brass, marble busts of english statesmen. mycroft holmes is standing at a refectory table, with his back to the door, engaged in a curious operation. a dusty bottle of wine is held in an ingeniously engineered cradle. as he turns the crank, the bottle tilts forward gently, and he decants the wine into three glasses without disturbing the sediment. mycroft is an impressive figure of a man, seven years older than sherlock, impeccably dressed. behind his snobbish airs and bantering manner, one senses tremendous reserves of strength and authority. the door opens, and holmes and watson enter.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<P>__{(without turning)}
<D>__{come in, come in, sherlock dr. watson... sit down.}
<P>__{(holmes and watson seat themselves)}
<D>__{you're looking very fit, both of you.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(putting down hat and cane)}
<D>__{and how are you, mycroft? how's your gout?}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{under control. except for the occasional twinge.}
<A>__{he brings over two of the glasses of wine to holmes and watson.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{i have a treat for you a very old madeira 1814. there are only six bottles left in the world. i have two of them, and am negotiating for a third.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{if you don't mind my saying so, anybody who's susceptible to gout shouldn't be }
<A>__{mycroft has moved back to the table and picked up his glass of madeira.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{the last doctor who warned me about that was crossing piccadilly, slipped on an orange peel, and was run over by a delivery van from the fortnum and mason. your very good health.}
<A>__{he and watson sip their drinks, but not holmes.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{why are you wasting this precious stuff on us?}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{well, i see you so rarely. how long has it been? not since the case of the greek interpreter.}
<P>__{(to watson)}
<D>__{isn't it ridiculous? two brothers living in the same town...}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{in the same town, perhaps but not the same world.}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(taking another sip)}
<D>__{mmmm. superb. how old did you say it was?}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{1814. one year before waterloo.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{one year before waterloo? think of that.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{you do know where waterloo is, don't you, doctor?}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{belgium, isn't it?}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{quite.}
<P>__{(turning to holmes)}
<D>__{and speaking of belgium, it has come to my attention that you are interested in the whereabouts of a certain engineer.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{yes, i am.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{well, i can save you a lot of trouble.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i'd be grateful for any suggestion }
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{my suggestion is that you pursue it no further.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{any particular reason?}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{because it involves the national security. we are handling this matter ourselves.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{we? who's we?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{the diogenes club, of course.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{i didn't say that.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i have always suspected that there was some underground connection between this stodgy and seemingly calcified establishment and the foreign office in whitehall.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{that's neither here nor there.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it seems to me that the diogenes club is here, there and everywhere. when there are rumblings of revolt in the sudan, an expedition subsidized by your club conveniently shows up to study the source of the nile. when there is trouble along the indian frontier, some of your fellow members pop up in the himalayas, alledgedly looking for the abominable snowman.}
<A>__{a young man in morning coat and striped trousers comes in, holding a telegram. mycroft crosses to him.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<P>__{(to watson)}
<D>__{what a fertile imagination my brother has. at the age of five, by carefully observing a neighbor's house, he deduced that babies were brought not by the stork, but by the mid wife in her satchel.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{as good an explanation as any.}
<A>__{mycroft has taken the telegram, and is coming forward with it. the young man clears his throat.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{yes, wiggins?}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{an immediate answer is requested, sir.}
<A>__{mycroft inserts a monocle in his eye, opens the telegram, moves toward the desk reading it.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{tell them that the three boxes go to glennahurich, and the red runner goes to the castle.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{the three boxes to glennahurich, the red runner to the castle. very good, sir.}
<A>__{he exits. holmes glances toward the telegram as mycroft puts it down on his desk. catching his look, mycroft turns his telegram face down, lets the monocle drop from his eye.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{why don't you crumple it up and swallow it to make sure.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{my dear sherlock, there are certain affairs that do not come within the province of the private detective. they have to be dealt with on an altogether different level.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{in other words, you want me to stay within my limits.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{i do indeed.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{speaking of limits, what exactly is jonah limited?}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{sherlock, when i said drop this case, it was not merely a suggestion it was an order!}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{by whose authority?}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{by the authority of her majesty's government. i hope i've made myself clear.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{perfectly.}
<A>__{in his nervousness he drops his bowler, which rolls along the floor.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{now if you'll excuse me, gentlemen }
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{goodbye, sir.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{a pleasure, as always.}
<A>__{he and watson retrieve their hats, move toward the door.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<P>__{(to holmes)}
<D>__{just a minute.}
<P>__{(picks up holmes' cane)}
<D>__{you forgot your tool kit.}
<A>__{he tosses the cane to holmes, who catches it.}
