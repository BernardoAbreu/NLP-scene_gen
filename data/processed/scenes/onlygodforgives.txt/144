<A>__{the concierge and the manager see jenna coming towards them and brace themselves... however, to their relief, she diverts to the palm court area where gordon is waiting for her.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{nice evening?}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{lovely, yeah. just catching up, you know.}
<A>__{jenna sits down. lights a cigarette.}
<C>__{jenna }
<D>__{you're a piece of work, aren't you?}
<A>__{gordon blushes. jenna blows out her match.}
<C>__{jenna }
<D>__{no fucking hanging about with you, is there?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{well, i don't know about that. just been out here a while... know how to get things done.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{i bet you do.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{but things are going to shit. since billy died, julian's all over the place...}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{we'll have to something about that the, wont we? but, first things first, what about chang?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{my son's guardian angel.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{he's just a retired cop...}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{good, then he won't be to hard to kill, will he?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{it's not that simple... is there somewhere we can go that's a little more private?}
<A>__{beat. she raises her eyebrows.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{what did you have in mind?}
<A>__{gordon blushes. moves closer, conspiratorial...}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{you can't just going round killing cops here anymore. it's not that easy.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{i didn't say it was easy. but then, you're a resourceful man, aren't you?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{i looked into it. chang's a hard man to get to. none of the thais'll go near him...}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{well then you're going to have to find someone who's not a fucking thai then, aren't you?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{there might be a way... but julian can't find out...}
<A>__{jenna looks at gordon smiles and crosses her legs.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{don't you worry about that. there are certain things that a mother and son shouldn't and don't discuss...}
<A>__{gordon thinks he does but isn't a hundred per cent sure.}
