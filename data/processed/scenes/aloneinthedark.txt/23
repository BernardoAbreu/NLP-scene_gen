<L>__{exterior alley 13h}
<A>__{carnby bursts out of the herbalist store's back door, exiting out into a small, cluttered alley. carnby lands hard in the debris, but he rolls with the fall and is back up on his feet, running. the alley ends in a high wall with a billboard on top of it. the wall has a railing along one side. carnby vaults over the railing and keeps running. the alley is crowded with workers unloading crates out of the loading dock of the ice factory. a beat cop walks by. carnby runs past the beat cop, just barely bumping into him. but as carnby passes him, he deftly grabs the beat cop's gun from his holster. the beat cop doesn't even notice his gun is missing as he turns, annoyed to see carnby racing away.}

<A>__{pinkerton runs out of the herbalist store's back door. he runs directly at the high wall. pinkerton leaps up, scrambling right up the side of the wall. he hauls himself up the billboard, until he's standing at the top of the billboard itself. pinkerton looks down below and spots carnby running into the loading dock of the ice factory. pinkerton leaps off the billboard. the beat cop looks up, stunned to see pinkerton leaping towards him. pinkerton lands on top of a moving dolly of crates, crushing the crates on it. the worker pushing the dolly falls back, shocked. pinkerton leaps off the dolly and keeps chasing after carnby. the beat cop fumbles for his gun. it's not there. pinkerton smashes the beat cop out of the way as he pursues carnby. the beat cop flies into a pile of crates, knocked out. pinkerton follows carnby into the ice factory.}
