<A>__{david's sister, jennifer, hangs out with her friends in the parking lot. all the girls are dressed in the exact same uniform: blue jeans, beeper on the belt, white v neck t shirt, car keys in their hand. (even the girls without a car hold car keys in their hand). jennifer is by far the prettiest and, thus, is the leader of the group. they all look toward the luncheon court where david and his friends are hanging out.}

<A>__{a group of very hip boys strut through the parking lot. they bop up and down with the self confidence of all cool sixteen year olds. the girls freeze when they see them.}

<D>__{hi mark.}
<B>__{different angle.}
<A>__{he pauses then looks over at her. jennifer slides sinuously off the fender of the car, flicking her hair like a young racehorse. she has a perfect 16 year old body and the whole parking lot knows it. mark heads over to her, followed by his lackies. the two groups meet at the tail gate of the nissan pathfinder like a small summit conference.}

<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{my mom'll be out of town.}
<A>__{kimmy and christin positively gasp while mark's lackeys mumble and glance around. the import of the thing isn't lost on anybody. mark bobs up and down a little faster.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{so uh ... maybe we could uh ...}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{cool.}
<C>__{mark}
