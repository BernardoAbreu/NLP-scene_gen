<L>__{interior drew's kitchen night}
<A>__{amanda's about to put the roast on the table when gus nuzzles up behind her, breathing down her backside. with his drink in hand, he sweeps her hair aside and zeros in for a kiss on the back of the neck. gus eases his free hand around between amanda and the counter and presses his palm firmly into her crotch, drawing her body tight to him. she stiffens at his intimate hold, uncomfortable with his timing.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{gus, please...}
<A>__{at the back door, drew is watching from beyond the screen, disgusted by the sight of gus pawing his mother. drew swings the door open as loud as he can to signal his return. gus plants a last kiss on the back of amanda's neck and backs off. but before he goes, he snatches a chunk of meat from the serving platter. leveling his leering eyes at amanda, he stuffs it into his mouth suggestively.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{god damn, you're good.}
<A>__{drew rolls his eyes and takes his seat at the table, returning his attention to the tv, where another music video is on. gus glances at the tv, annoyed by the music. he drops into his spot at the head of the table, blocking drew's view. drew leans to the side for a better look. gus takes notice and leans to the same side to obstruct his view.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{you're breaking the law here, drew.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{really, gus. it won't bother me.}
<A>__{gus ignores her, inching forward with a confidential, harsh whisper.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{your mom's spent the last hour cooking. stop being a little jerk and show her some appreciation.}
<A>__{drew aims the remote control at gus, as if to shut him up, and silences the tv. amanda approaches with the roast. the moment it's on the table, drew starts dishing up a hefty serving. gus spears drew's fork with the serving fork.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{not that much appreciation. i thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{hey, i'm so sorry i'm not the stud that you are.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{knock it off, guys...}
<A>__{gus throws back a sip of bourbon.}
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(to drew, quietly)}
<D>__{you watch that mouth of yours, drew buddy.}
