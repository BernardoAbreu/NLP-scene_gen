<L>__{exterior barton cottage garden path day}
<A>__{willoughby is leaving. he has a flower from marianne's bunch in his buttonhole and is on his horse, looking about as virile as his horse. everyone has come out to say goodbye, marianne supported by elinor and mrs dashwood.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{till tomorrow! and my pocket sonnets are yours, miss marianne! a talisman against further injury!}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{goodbye! thank you!}
<A>__{he gallops off. they all wave. margaret follows him down the road for a while.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{good work, marianne! you have covered all forms of poetry; another meeting will ascertain his views on nature and romantic attachments and then you will have nothing left to talk about and the acquaintanceship will be over.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{i suppose i have erred against decorum. i should have been dull and spiritless and talked only of the weather, or the state of the roads.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{no, but mr willoughby can be in no doubt of your enthusiasm for him.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{why should he doubt it? why should i hide my regard?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{no particular reason, marianne, only that we know so little of him }
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{but time alone does not determine intimacy. seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other and seven days are more than enough for others.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{or seven hours in this case.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{i feel i know mr willoughby well already. if i had weaker, more shallow feelings perhaps i could conceal them, as you do }
<A>__{then she realises what she's said.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{marianne, that is not fair }
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{i am sorry, elinor, i did not mean}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{i know. do not trouble yourself, marianne.}
<A>__{elinor turns back into the house.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{i do not understand her, mamma. why does she never mention edward? i have never even seen her cry about him, or about norland.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{nor i. but elinor is not like you or i, dear. she does not like to be swayed by her emotions.}
