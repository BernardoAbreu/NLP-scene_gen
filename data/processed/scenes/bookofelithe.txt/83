<L>__{exterior bay rope bridge day}
<A>__{eli and solara make their way carefully across the bridge. it feels highly unstable and sags low over the bay, the waters below close enough to lap around their ankles.}
<L>__{exterior alcatraz island day}
<A>__{eli and solara arrive at the prison gates. securely locked. as they inspect it for a possible way to enter:}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{who goes there?}
<A>__{they look up. a guard in paramilitary fatigues is stationed in one of the perimeter towers. training a rifle on them.}
<C>__{alcatraz guard}
<D>__{identify yourselves!}
<A>__{in the opposite tower another guard has his rifle trained on them too. eli looks up, raises his hands.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{my name is elijah stone. i have a message for your boss. i need you to tell him that i have a king james bible in my possession.}
<B>__{beat.}
<C>__{alcatraz guard}
<D>__{remain where you are! do not attempt to move or you will be fired upon!}
<A>__{keeping the gun trained on them, the tower guard uses his free hand to talk into a walkie talkie radio. we don't hear the conversation. all eli and solara can do is wait. the guard puts away his radio and shouts back down:}
<C>__{alcatraz guard}
<D>__{be prepared to surrender any weapons at the gate!}
<A>__{beat. and then the massive front gates slowly open on mechanical runners with the low groan of rusted iron. eli and solara look at each other, then step gingerly inside.}
