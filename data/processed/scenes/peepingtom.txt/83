<L>__{interior studio e. early evening}
<A>__{close shot of mark. he is holding his cine camera; fixed to it is a collapsible tripod. suddenly he pulls one leg of the tripod out. we see that a very sharp spike protrudes from the end of it. from mark's pov we see vivian looking at the spike. he raises it towards her until the spike is only inches from her throat.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{yes... that would be frightening!}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{but... there's something else...}
<A>__{we can hear his heart pounding as if it will burst and gradually vivian, too, becomes aware of it.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{well? what is it?}
<A>__{just for a moment mark's arm moves. his back hides what he is doing. suddenly we see vivian turn her head sharply she is looking at something out of camera.}
<C>__{vivian}
<P>__{(in a whisper)}
<D>__{that...?}
<A>__{the spike is very close to her throat but vivian ignores it, staring out of camera. over mark's shoulder we concentrate on vivian's face.}
<C>__{vivian}
<P>__{(in a whisper)}
<D>__{mark... take it...}
<A>__{the fear on her face is rapidly growing...}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{... away!}
<A>__{she tries to move back but the trunk prevents her.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{mark you!}
<A>__{it is almost a scream. we can hear mark breathing quickly. vivian raises her hands to push something away from her. suddenly the screen is filled with her eyes. we see them dilating with terror. there is a sudden crash as the big power switches go out in the roof. the lights go out. there is a scream in the darkness. then silence. the darkness acquires a grey, opaque quality as if one is seeing the world through a curtain it is the world of mrs. stephens. a bright light is felt, rather than seen, beating against our eyelids. it looms closer and stronger.}
<C>__{helen's voice }
<D>__{and that, darling, is the end of the news! unless you want the football results?}
<A>__{close shot of mrs. stephens, a large glass of whisky and the bottle beside her. it is night.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{no thank you.}
<A>__{close shot of helen. 'she's got the key of the door' is overlaid.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what else can i read you?}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{the label on this whisky bottle! are you sure it says seventy per cent proof?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{certain.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{they're bigger liars than the press!}
<A>__{from helen's pov we see her reach for her glass with a steady hand.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{is that your last tonight?}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{i doubt it.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{your last but one?}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{don't haggle.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(producing a coin)}
<D>__{toss me double or nothing?}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{done!}
<A>__{helen spins the coin on the table mrs. stephens listens intently... the coin stops spinning.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{heads.}
<A>__{her fingers shoot out and feel the surface of the coin.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{bad luck, darling.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{huh.}
<A>__{she turns the coin over and carefully feels the other side. helen watches her with a smile then looks thoughtfully at the ceiling.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{what are you looking at?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{the ceiling!}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{wondering if that young man is home?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{well he is... i heard him come in... four paragraphs ago.}
<A>__{from helen's pov we see the sightless eyes staring at her.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{do you like him?}
<A>__{close shot of helen.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{yes, darling.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{he has a quality...}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<P>__{(sipping her glass)}
<D>__{wish this had.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{... and i think he could help me.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{with your photographs?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{yes...}
<A>__{close shot of mrs. stephens.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{helen...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{mrs. stephens hesitates which is rare.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<P>__{(abruptly)}
<D>__{it doesn't matter.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{mummy, what's worrying you?}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{the price of whisky.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what else?}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{what else matters?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{don't you like mark?}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{haven't met him.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you don't like him! now why not?}
<A>__{close shot of mrs. stephens. again she hesitates.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{i distrust a man who walks quietly.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{he's shy!}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{his footsteps aren't! they're stealthy...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{now darling.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{are you going up to him?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{may i?}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{we both have the key of the door... mine needs oiling and yours needs exercise... off you go.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{she kisses her and glances at the whisky glass.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{remember that you lost the toss.}
<A>__{she walks to the door.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{helen...}
<C>__{helen}

<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{if you're back in five minutes... i won't even finish this.}

<A>__{she hurries out. mrs. stephens instantly refills her glass. close shot of her hand. it has begun to tremble. mark's dark room close shot of mark's hands, in the green light of the dark room. he is busy unloading and winding film onto a developing rack. he puts the rack of exposed film into the tank and starts the time clock. close shot of the time clock ticking. a knock is heard off. mark looks up.}
<C>__{mark}
