<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(to beck)}
<D>__{roger...}
<P>__{(to sixpack)}
<D>__{more light, sixpack...}
<A>__{there is no answer. willie turns around. her helmet lamp eerily illuminating the darkness around her. sixpack is nowhere to be seen.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{sixpack?}
<A>__{she turns in the other direction and suddenly blinding lights are turned on.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{boo!}
<A>__{sixpack laughs. his lights now on, he stands right behind her.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{you shit....}
<C>__{beck's voice}
<D>__{what's going on, four? what's happening?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{we're fine, shack. his lights malfunctioned for a minute. how's this?}
<A>__{she again holds out her hand to the rov.}
<B>__{inside shack}
<A>__{beck looks at the monitor and presses a red button to start the tape, then after five seconds releases the button.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{that's great. now let's move 35 degrees southwest.}
<B>__{willie and sixpack moving}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(to sixpack)}
<D>__{you screw around like that again and }
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{what's wrong, did you miss me?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{hardly.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{don't worry, darlin, i'm...}
<A>__{suddenly sixpack's foot hits some loose rock and slides. willie turns in his direction and sees his headlight turning, becoming smaller, then disappearing as his radio goes dead.}
<B>__{inside on beck}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{what's wrong?! what happened?}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{on willie she has stopped in her tracks. all around her is blackness. her helmet light hardly penetrates the darkness.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{sixpack?! sixpack...}
<A>__{then she looks down a cliff right in front of her feet. the drop is thirty feet into a waving sea of tubers. beck's voice brings willie back.}
<C>__{beck's voice}
<D>__{willie? what's going on?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{he's gone. i think he's fallen. i'm going down after him.}
<B>__{mess}
<A>__{jones is bench pressing 200 pounds on a fold down compact gym, while dejesus huffs and puffs on an exercise bike.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{that's it jonesy...sweat it out, man...got to get the poison out of our blood.}
<A>__{jones grits his teeth and struggles against the weight, suddenly bowman throws open the door and sticks her head in.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{sixpack is lost.}
<A>__{corridor moments later bowman, jones and dejesus are heading for the control room where they are joined by cobb.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{weren't they tied? they're supposed to be tied.}
<A>__{they all enter the}
<B>__{control room}
<A>__{beck is at the console with doc in his chair.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{how far away is she?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{two hundred meters.}
<A>__{willie's voice silences them.}
<C>__{willie's voice}
<D>__{four to shack...nearing the bottom. look at this...}
<A>__{they all stare at the monitor. the screen is filled with huge waving tubers.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{my god, look at the size of those tubers....}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{nine, ten feet high...}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{if he had his blinkers on }
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{it wouldn't make any difference in there...he could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{on willie she moves through the dense waving forest of giant tubers, parting them with her hands as she moves slowly.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{sixpack?}
<B>__{control room}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{why can't we pick up his signal?}
<C>__{dejesus}
<P>__{(a joke)}
<D>__{maybe he got eaten?}
<C>__{bowman}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{what would be dumb enough to eat sixpack?}
<B>__{on willie}
<A>__{she moves aside the last of the tubers and freezes at the sight in front of her.}
<C>__{willie's voice}
<D>__{four to shack...you picking this up?}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{all eyes suddenly go to the monitor. a huge dark maw fills the screen.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{affirmative...widening picture.}
<A>__{the image on the screen widens and we see the opening is a huge gash in the side of a sunken ship.}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(to doc)}
<D>__{tighten the picture on the upper righthand corner.}
<A>__{close on the monitor: the picture zooms in on the corner and willie's added light suddenly brings the letter "m" into focus. beck presses the red record button and pans the rov slowly across the bulkhead of the ship. the next letter is an "a". then suddenly a cyrillic letter appears, then others.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{what the?...}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{russian.}
<C>__{willie's voice}
<D>__{i'm going inside.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{what's your air reading?}
<C>__{willie's voice}
<D>__{twenty minutes...}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{twenty minutes!...who had tank duty?}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{who else...sixpack.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{the man is unbelievable... i say, leave him in there.}
<C>__{bowman}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{what about his suit? that's a million five the company's got to replace. they'll make somebody go get it.}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(to willie)}
<D>__{willie, we're giving you five minutes...after that we're coming in.}
<A>__{willie's pov her life support gauges move eerily around the perimeter of her mask. she moves along steadily down darkened corridors. she opens a door and it drops from its corroded hinges a cloud of sludge rises off the bottom. the room looks empty.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{sixpack?...answer me.}
<A>__{she throws open another door. it also looks empty, then wham! a grotesque echonoderm slams into her helmet. willie bats it aside and as soon as she recovers shines her light into the room. what she sees: the ship's infirmary. broken glass, stainless steel...the light does strange things, reflecting, sparkling...}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{the infirmary...}
<C>__{beck's voice}
<D>__{three minutes...}
<A>__{her helmet mounted camera pans the room one more time, then as she turns to leave it captures a strange gleam of white in the corner a large human like skeleton. willie doesn't see it.}
