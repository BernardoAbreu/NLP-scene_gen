<L>__{interior father benedetto's kitchen evening}
<A>__{jack eats a bowl of chilled carrot and sorrel soup in silence. father benedetto watches him, pleased to see his guest so absorbed. as soon as jack has finished, father benedetto invites him to help himself from the ancient tureen. then he bustles over to the stove, humming again. jack eats, studying a framed photo of father benedetto with his arm around a tough, corpulent italian man in his mid twenties. fabio. father benedetto returns to the table with a large covered dish issuing steam into his face. he notices jack's eye line.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{all the sheep in my flock are dear to me, but some are dearer than most. especially those that have strayed from the fold.}
<A>__{off jack's intrigued look father benedetto clarifies:}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{fabio. he is a... [in italian] 'car doctor'. but i suspect his practice is not entirely sound. ecco!}
<A>__{father benedetto whisks the lid off the covered dish revealing a stew of poultry carcasses covered in sauce.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{fagiano. pheasant. with sauce of orange juice, orange peel, chestnuts, garlic, marsala wine and... come si dici in inglese? brodo di pollo. chicken broth.}
<A>__{father benedetto serves each of them with a complete bird and pours white wine into fresh glasses.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{also: salsify in garlic butter. mange tout. fried wild mushrooms with truffle.}
<A>__{jack helps himself to vegetables. father benedetto watches him as he savours his first taste. jack licks his lips and sips some cold white wine. the two men regard one another, the priest awaiting a verdict.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sinful.}
<A>__{father benedetto shrugs.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{the holy father eats better than this.}
<A>__{the flash of a smile crosses the priest's face.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{have you ever wanted to be anything other than a priest?}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{have you ever wanted to be anything other than a... come se dice in inglese...?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{photographer?}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{photographer.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i do what i'm good at.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{i'm sure you have other talents. you have the hands of a craftsman, not an artist. you are good with machines. yet you told me just the opposite when we first met.}
<A>__{jack hides his unease from the watchful priest.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{journalism cannot make you a rich man.}
<A>__{father benedetto's eyes flick over the rolex.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{perhaps you are rich already?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm not a young man. i have my savings.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<P>__{(in italian)}
<D>__{my meagre income is subject to the vagaries of the stock market and with church attendance declining there's less and less money in the offertory. but if a man has god in his vaults...}
<A>__{he looks searchingly at jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't think god is interested in me. father.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<P>__{(in english)}
<D>__{i know better than to try to make a convert over pheasant and trebbiano.}
<A>__{jack is silent. the two men continue eating. then casually:}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what are the snakes for, father?}
<A>__{father benedetto taps the end of his nose in the universal sign for secrecy.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{"the grave soul keeps its own secrets, and takes its own punishment in silence."}
<A>__{he has a twinkle in his eye. the priest is on a mission to extract the truth... and jack knows it.}
