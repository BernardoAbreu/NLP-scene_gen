<ACTION>__{OVER BLACK WE HEAR THE DULL SOUNDS OF INDUSTRY; A MUFFLED MASS OF MACHINES, GEARS, STEAM. FADE IN ON: A SIGN. Twelve feet across. Painted decades earlier, grim- covered black, white and red. It reads in large 40's era, hand-painted type, "SAFETY IS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN!" Then: "DAYS SINCE LAST ACCIDENT" and below that, NUMBERS, painted on hanging metal cards. Four possible digits can hang here, but there are currently three: "784." SLOWLY PUSH IN on this sign as a MAN APPEARS, rising on a forklift, in a greasy, monochromatic work jumpsuit. Removes the "4" from its hooks. Then removes the "8." Then the "7." Finally, he hangs up a number. "1." The man LOWERS out of frame as we creep even closer to the hanging single digit, wondering about the accident... and how bad it was and the FACTORY SOUNDS GROW DEAFENING -- AND AS IT BUILDS TO A CRESCENDO, WE CUT TO SILENT BLACKNESS:}

He holds the locket. Rubs it gently with his thumb. CONTINUE TO BOOM UP. We now SEE THE BOY'S FACE. This is JOE LAMB, 14. On the precarious edge of adulthood. He looks out at the horizon with stricken eyes. He moves forward and we PAN, so we're BEHIND HIM NOW. In the frosty distance, past countless leafless trees and modest homes, is a STEEL MILL. Smokestacks and structures. The lifeblood of this late 70's town.}

<ACTION>__{A WIDE SHOT. A grey, snow-covered, early February day here in LILLIAN, OHIO. Many cars are parked outside the house, notably a SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SQUAD CAR in the driveway. Joe, a vision of black on white in his too-big black suit, now sits on a small swing set he hasn't used in years. He solemnly looks down at the LOCKET he still holds. No doubt trying to reconcile the fact that it no longer hangs around his mother's neck. Then a SOUND. Joe looks up. A CAR has arrived -- a distinct 1968 BUICK GSX -- a YELLOW MUSCLE CAR with a BLACK RACING STRIPE down its center. Joe watches as the car sits there for a moment. Then a MAN gets out. Someone Joe has seen before, but doesn't know personally. A man in his early 40's, in jeans and a work shirt. He's not exactly sloppy, but if you look closely, you could tell he's been drinking. This is LOUIS DAINARD. Joe watches Louis carefully as he moves to the house, to the porch and inside the house. Joe's eyes glued on the house for a while. Then he looks back to the locket. He OPENS IT, and stares at the picture inside (which we do not see). And as he stares, TEARS come to his eyes. A moment broken by the SOUND OF RAISED VOICES -- Joe turns toward the house. After a beat, the SOUND of something BREAKING -- something glass. Then the house BACK DOOR bursts open -- Joe cranes his neck -- and what he sees he'll never forget: his father, Jack, leading an in-pain and HAND-CUFFED Louis Dainard from the house and into the rear of the squad car. When he slams the back door, he sees Joe. Sort of freezes as their eyes lock. But Jack's more uncomfortable}

It's an old WAREHOUSE, dirty, cobwebbed, crowded with CRATES, old MACHINERY, CHEMICAL BARRELS and JUNK. The Detective turns on his FLASHLIGHT -- aims it -- sweeps it across the space -- the light HITTING THE LENS for a moment. The Detective walks through the spooky, dark space. A low, growling industrial DRONE makes the whole place oddly creepy. Then: A SOUND -- quick but strange -- slithering -- and the Detective aims his flashlight -- tense. He watches. Waits. We see where he's aiming the light, which cuts through THICK DUST in the air. It's an old office door, ajar. Hathaway is still. Nervous. Watching the door -- waiting for it to open... and then -- from the darkness BEHIND HIM -- a terrifying open-mouthed ZOMBIE APPEARS -- ATTACKS -- and the Detective TURNS -- his flashlight KNOCKED TO THE GROUND -- and Hathaway falls too -- the wild-eyed gaping-mouthed Zombie DROOLING as it tries to bite Hathaway's flesh -- we recognize that the Zombie is CARY. Actually, not a bad performance. The Detective pulls out his GUN -- but the Zombie grabs his wrist -- they wrestle with the gun -- the Zombie wanting to rip into Hathaway's neck -- but Hathaway sees three SHARP-TIPPED NAILS sticking out of an old piece of WOODEN CRATE -- and after a significant struggle, Hathaway PUSHES THE ZOMBIE BACK so his head is IMPALED BY THE NAILS -- which we see ENTER HIS SKULL!!!
