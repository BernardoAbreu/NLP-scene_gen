<L>__{interior large investment bank trading floor day}
<A>__{the frame is filled with the face of peter sullivan, a 27 year old risk assessment analyst. he has a doctorate from mit and is staring intently into a large bank of computer screens. an elevator door opens and four human resources people come out of the elevator carrying large file boxes. they walk down a long glass enclosed hallway that runs the full length of the trading floor. the scope of the floor now comes into frame. there are more computers than can be imagined and several large boards on the far walls that are scrolling thousands of numbers. peter gives a knowing glance to the guy sitting next to him, seth bregman, a young analyst in his early twenties.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{is that them?}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(nods yes)}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{jesus christ.}
<A>__{the human resources people turn and separate into a large glass walled conference room that runs along the floor as almost every person on the floor watches.}
<C>__{seth }
<D>__{are they going to do it right there?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{fuck me.}
<A>__{will emerson, sitting next to them, leans back in his chair.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{have you guys ever seen this before?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{best to just ignore it. keep your head down and get back to work... and don't watch.}
<A>__{the hr people begin walking out onto the floor looking at a piece of paper in their hand then walking up behind a person and asking their name. it is brutal. the camera follows one hr woman, heather, with her piece of paper down the hall and into a row of employees, she walks right past the three guys then stops a bit down from them.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{timothy singh?}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{i'm afraid we have to speak with you.}
<A>__{tim gets up and walks back towards the conference room with the woman. peter puts on his headphones and very loud rap music drowns out all other noise and peter tries to get lost back into the numbers on his computer screen. the sequence follows the hr people walking around and firing people intercut with peter just staring at his computer screen. it runs for almost the length of the song until finally the same woman comes walking back down the hall and stops behind peter and taps him on the shoulder. he takes off his headphones and the music stops. he is shell shocked.}
<C>__{heather }
<D>__{eric dale?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{eric dale?}

<D>__{i'm not eric dale.}

<C>__{peter}
<D>__{he's my boss, he's down that hall.}
<L>__{interior eric dale's office continuous}
<A>__{eric dale is sitting at his desk, he is 52 years old and looks exhausted. he looks out through the glass of his office as she walks over to the door.}

<D>__{mr. dale?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{this way.}
<A>__{eric walks out the door first.}
<L>__{interior trading floor continuous}
<A>__{they walk along the full length of the trading floor to reach one of the conference rooms. everyone left on the floor is watching.}
<L>__{interior trading floor meeting room continuous}
<A>__{there is a more senior looking human resources lawyer, lauren bratberg, already sitting at the table. they all sit and look at each other for a beat.}
<C>__{lauren bratberg}
<D>__{well... mr. dale i'm obviously sorry that we are here today but these are extra ordinary times as you very well must know.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i run risk management... it just doesn't seem like a natural place to start cutting.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{i hope you understand that this is in no way personal. a majority of this floor is being let go today.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{ok}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{mr. dale. ms. bratberg is now going to run through the details of what the firm is offering.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{ok}
<A>__{lauren bratberg slides across the table a very thick severance contract agreement.}
<C>__{lauren bratberg}
<D>__{mr. dale the firm is offering you six months severance at half your salary. you will keep all unvested options that you currently hold. health will be extended through that period. you have till tomorrow at...}
<A>__{she looks at her watch.}
<C>__{lauren bratberg }
<D>__{4:47 to either take the offer or it will be revoked. do you understand?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{lauren bratberg}
<D>__{now, unfortunately mr. dale due to the highly sensitive nature of your work here the firm has to take certain precautions for security purposes that may seem punitive in nature. i hope considering your...}
<A>__{she looks down at the piece of paper in front of her to fact check.}
<C>__{lauren bratberg }
<D>__{...over 19 years of service to the firm, you will understand that these measures are in no way a reflection of the firms' feelings towards your performance or your character.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i'm sorry??}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{she's apologizing for what's about to happen.}
<C>__{lauren bratberg}
<D>__{your company email, access to the server, access to the building, and your mobile data and phone service will all be severed as of this meeting. this gentleman...}
<A>__{she points behind him and a smallish benign looking security guard is standing in the doorway.}
<C>__{lauren bratberg }
<D>__{will take you to your office so that you can clear out your personal belongings.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{what about my current ongoing work? i'm right in the...}
<C>__{lauren bratberg}
<D>__{the firm has worked out its transition plan and is prepared to move forward, but we appreciate your concern.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{we understand that this is very difficult and here is my card. please contact me over the next few weeks if there is anything that i can do to help you through this transition in your life.}
<A>__{they all stare at each other in silence for several long awkward beats.}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{sir?}
<A>__{eric finally stands up and walks out with the guard and back over to his office.}
<L>__{interior eric dale's office}
<A>__{eric walks into the office and sits at his desk and begins to clear his things out into a file box. the guard stands at the door. eventually eric's sympathetic yet still energetic immediate superior, will emerson comes to the door.}

<C>__{eric}
<D>__{you know i was just in the middle of a bunch of shit here that someone should really take a look at.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{eric, they are telling us that everyone has got to get out of here and leave everything behind. while we appreciate your concern, this is not your problem anymore. alright? good luck.}
<A>__{eric looks straight ahead as will leaves the office. he packs up the last of his things, which does not take long, then stands and gets ready to walk out. he looks around and heads out into the cubicle area.}

<A>__{sam rogers walks out of his office and stands in front of the trading floor that just an hour before had seated 130 people. now just thirty three are scattered throughout the vast mostly empty space. they all look up in silence at him. long pause, then sam's face begins to glow a bit. his posture straightens, he fills up. he speaks slowly at first then builds.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{you are all still here for a reason... most of this floor was just sent home... forever. we have spent the last hour saying good bye... they were good people and they were good at their jobs... but you all were better. now they are gone. they are not to be thought of again. this is your opportunity. on every floor of this building and in every office from hong kong to london the same thing is happening. before this is all done 3 of every ten guys who were standing between you and your boss's job are now gone. that is your opportunity. i've been at this place for thirty four years and let me tell you that this will not be the last time you go through this. but you all are survivors... and that is how this firm over 107 years has always continued to grow stronger. so hold your heads high... and get back to work.}

<C>__{eric }

<A>__{this time she looks up. when she sees him she debates if she should stop. she does. he slowly moves a little closer to her, still carrying the slightly tattered box with his personal belongings in it.}

<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{peter}

<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well it's a fairly complicated...}

<D>__{you want one?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{peter gives him a bit of a look.}

<D>__{what?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{we are in here stressing our fucking heads off that the world as we know it is ending, and they've got no idea what's coming.}

<C>__{peter}
<D>__{twenty seven.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{whatever, same thing, i made almost a quarter of a million dollars last year... for what... pushing some numbers around on a computer screen, so a bunch of glorified crack addicts could take that information and pretend to understand it, and then make a bet against some other jock half way around the world who if he wasn't doing this would probably be in some otb somewhere putting it all on number seven. and at the end of the day one guy loses and the other guy wins.}

<D>__{one of eric's guys.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{...and tells him that he was almost on to something but hasn't been able to figure it out. so he gives him the disk and says give it a try... but the last thing he says as the doors to the elevator close is `be careful'...}

<D>__{be careful?}

<D>__{...it isn't good.}
<A>__{will's look gets sam up and he comes over to stand behind will at his desk and look at the computer.}
<C>__{will emerson }
<D>__{as far as i can tell these here are the historical volatility index limits... which i guess our whole fucking trading model relies on pretty heavily... and we are so fucking levered up that if this thing starts getting outside those limits it gets ugly in a hurry.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{how ugly?}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{real ugly.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{and how close to those limits have we gotten?}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{oh we're beyond close... we broke through five or six days over the last two weeks, but we've managed to stay on the upside of it... for now...}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{for now?}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{well look what happens here when we get on the wrong side of it.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{what am i looking at?}
<A>__{will takes his finger and points at a red number with a whole lot of zeroes after it. sam's look says it all.}

<D>__{well... in laymen terms my thesis was a study in the way that friction ratios effect steering outcomes in aeronautical use under reduced gravity loads.}

<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{yes. but as you certainly know our business is selling and buying. it doesn't work for very long without both components. if we suddenly stop buying for a day or two that just doesn't hide under the rug, it gets out and this whole this thing comes to a end... and right quick.}
<C>__{jared cohen}

<D>__{please...}

<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{and sam we need eric dale, it's making me very uneasy knowing he is out there right now wanting to put a knife in our backs while he's not even aware he's holding the knife in his hand.}

<D>__{jesus man.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{did you know the fear most people feel when they stand on the edge like this is not actually a fear that they will fall but instead it's the subconscious fearing that they might jump? ....it's a fear of losing faith.}

<C>__{peter}
<D>__{how would they even do that?}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{you can't... it's impossible. but they'll figure out a way. i've been at this place for ten years and i've seen some things that you wouldn't believe... and when all is said and done... they don't lose money. they don't care if everyone else does, but they won't.}

<D>__{what do you do with all that money?}

<D>__{i don't know really. it goes pretty quick. you learn to spend what's in your pocket.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{two and a half million goes quickly?}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{well the tax man takes half of it up front. so now you got what... million and a quarter. mortgage grabs another 300k, i gave 150 to my parents to live off, so now you got what??}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{eight hundred.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{i bought a car last year for 150. probably another 100 eating... 25 on clothes, put 400 away for a rainy day...}

<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{yeah, kinda shocked me, although i was able to write most of it off, as entertainment.}
<A>__{with that he flicks his cigarette over the edge of the building just as a massive corporate helicopter comes sweeping up from behind the building and comes right over their heads. they are now yelling above the rotor noise.}

<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{please sit down.}
<A>__{he then seats himself at the head of the table. everyone in the room has the printout in front of them. jared is seated immediately to his left, then sam, then sarah, ramesh, will, peter, and finally seth.}
<C>__{john tuld }
<D>__{welcome everyone. i must apologize for dragging you all here at such an uncommon hour but from what i've been told this matter needs to be handled urgently, so urgently in fact that it probably should have been addressed weeks ago...}
<C>__{john tuld }
<D>__{but that is spilt milk under the bridge. so why doesn't someone please try to explain to me what's the problem here?}

<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{jared, it's a little early for all that, how bout in english? ... actually i'd like to hear from the guy who put this thing together... mr. sullivan is it? does he speak english?}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{i'd like to speak to the analyst who seems to have stumbled across this mess.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{well, that's peter sullivan here.}
<A>__{jared looks down the table to peter, as does everyone else in the room. jared gives him a go ahead look.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{sir.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{ah, there he is.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{how old are you mr. sullivan?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i'm twenty seven sir.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{please call me john.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{so mr. sullivan why don't you tell me what you think is going on here, and please speak as you might to a young child or a golden retriever, i didn't get here on my brains i can assure you of that.}
<A>__{peter is very nervous.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well, sir. as i guess you may or may not know i work for mr. rogers here as an associate in the risk assessment and management office at mbs}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{now you lost me at m...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{sorry...}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{i was joking mr. sullivan.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yes... well as you probably know over the last 36 40 months the firm has begun packaging new mbs products that combine several different traunches of rating classification in one tradable security. this has been very profitable as i imagine you noticed.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{i have.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well the firm is currently doing a considerable amount of this business every day. the problem, which is i guess why we are here tonight, is that it takes us... the firm... almost a month to layer these products correctly thereby posing a challenge from a risk management standpointerior}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{and mr. sullivan that challenge is?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{we have to hold these assets on our books longer than we might ideally like to.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{but the key factor is these are essentially just mortgages, so that has allowed us to push the leverage considerably beyond what you might be willing, or allowed to do in any other circumstance, thereby pushing the risk profile without raising any red flags.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{and how far have we pushed that profile tonight mr. sullivan?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{we have pushed it to 1.215 trillion dollars... at mbs alone.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{give or take.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{give or take.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{now mr. sullivan what i am guessing, and give me a little rope here, what i am guessing that your report here says is that considering the, shall we say bumpy road, we've been on the last week or so that the numbers that your brilliant co workers up the line ahead of you had come up with in the past don't seem to make much sense anymore considering what's taking place today?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{actually not taking place today but what's already taken place over the last two weeks.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{so what you're saying is it's already happened?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{sort of.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{and mr. sullivan what does your model say that means for us here?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well, that's where it becomes a projection. but...}
<A>__{peter looks down at jared for approval to go forward.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{you're speaking with me mr. sullivan.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well... sir... if those assets were to decrease by just 25 percent, and remain on our books... well... that loss would be greater than the current market capitalization of this company.}
<A>__{the room goes silent. john tuld looks at peter long and hard. he then stands up and goes over to the window and looks into the city.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{so what you're telling me mr. sullivan is that the music appears to be about to stop and we are going to be holding the biggest bag of stinking shit ever assembled in the history of capitalism?}
<A>__{everyone looks back at peter.}
<C>__{john tuld }
<D>__{mr. sullivan?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well sir, i'm not sure i'd put it that way but let me clarify using your analogy, what this model shows is the music, so to speak, just slowing, if the music were to stop, as you put it, then this model would not be even close to that scenario. it would be considerably worse.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{well let me tell you something mr. sullivan. do you want to know why i'm sitting here in this chair with you all, why i get the big bucks, so to speak?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{i'm here for one reason and one reason only.}
<A>__{john tuld continues to look out over the city for a long beat.}
<C>__{john tuld }
<D>__{i'm here to guess what the music is gonna do a week, month, a year from now. that's it, nothing more....... and i'm afraid... standing here tonight... that i don't hear... a... thing... just silence.}
<A>__{the room falls completely still for at least half a minute. then john tuld spins around quickly with a considerably more upbeat tone and looks up and down the table.}
<C>__{john tuld }
<D>__{so, now that we know that the music has stopped, what can we do about it?}
<A>__{long silence.}
<C>__{john tuld }
<D>__{mr. cohen, ms. robertson, i'm afraid this is where you are supposed to step back in. lord knows we relied enough on mr. sullivan today.}
<A>__{jared and sarah come to attention and gather their thoughts.}
<C>__{john tuld }
<D>__{what have you got for us?}
<A>__{long pause.}
<C>__{john tuld }
<D>__{what have i told you since the first day you walked into my office? (pause) that there are three ways to make a living in this business... be first, be smarter, or cheat. well i don't cheat, and even though i like to think we have got some pretty smart people in this building of the two remaining options, it sure is a hell of alot easier to just be first.}
<A>__{the room goes silent again as mr. tuld stares back out the window.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{sell it all today...}
<A>__{john tuld smiles just a bit. then turns.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{is that even possible sam?}
<A>__{sam looks across the room at john tuld, they have known each other for 35 years.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{it is, but at what cost?}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{i will pay.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{john and sam look and read each other.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{almost a trillion bucks of paper?}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{where does it come back to us?}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{everywhere.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{sam, i don't think you seem to understand what your boy down here just said... if i made you... how would you do it?}
<A>__{sam rogers looks down at the table for a long, long, beat.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{you bring the traders in for their normal 6:30 meeting and you be honest with them, they're gonna know it's the end either way, so you'd have to throw them a bone, and a pretty big one. you'd have to come out of the gate storming... 40 percent done by 10:15 and 70 percent of your positions need to be gone by eleven, cause by lunch the word will be out. no swaps, no nothing, and by two o'clock you'll be getting 65 cents on the dollar, if you're lucky, and the feds will be in here looking up your ass and trying to slow us down.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{ramesh?}
<A>__{he looks to ramesh shah down the table.}
<C>__{ramesh}
<D>__{they'll slow you down but it's yours to sell. they can't stop you.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{john... let's just say we pull that off, which is saying something... the real question is... who are we selling this to?}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{the same people you've been selling this to for the last two years... and whoever else will buy it.}
<A>__{they look at each other to see if they understand each other.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{if you do this you've killed that market for years. it's over.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<P>__{(nods.)}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{and you are selling something you know has no value.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<P>__{(cuts him off cold)}
<D>__{we are selling to willing buyers at the current fair market price, so that we may survive, sam.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{you'll never sell a thing to any one of them again.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{do you!!! this is it, sam, this is it!}
<A>__{the rest of the table is taken aback and just watching them go at it. silence.}
<C>__{john tuld }
<D>__{it's 4:00... jared you've got till 5:00 to break this down and draw me up a plan.}
<C>__{john tuld }
<D>__{is there anyone else who actually knows what's in there right now, block by block?}

<D>__{i don't know.}

<D>__{probably...yes...almost definitely.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{are you?}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{no.}

<C>__{seth}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{it's not personal, you're just in the wrong place at the wrong time, the young guys are always the first to go. nothing i say is gonna make you feel any better.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i get it.}
<A>__{seth looks over at will and around at the interior of the luxury car and then back into the city.}
<D>__{seth (cont'd) (cont'd) when did you know this is what you wanted to do?}
<A>__{he thinks that through.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{the first time i made 36 million dollars for the firm in the last eleven minutes of the trading day.}

<D>__{i guess. and what about everyone else?}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{everyone else?}

<D>__{normal people.}

<D>__{what are you a socialist? fuck me seth.}
<A>__{will looks over at seth, sizing him up, looking to see if he has what it takes.}
<C>__{will emerson }
<D>__{look, if you want to do this with your life, and do it well, you need to believe that you are necessary. and you are. if people want to live like this...with their big cars and these houses that they haven't even paid for. then you are necessary. the only reason they can continue to live like kings is because we've got our fingers on the scale in their favor. and if i were to take my finger off...}
<C>__{will emerson }
<D>__{then the whole world gets really fucking fair, really fucking quickly. and no one wants that, they say they do...but they don't. they want what we're giving them, but they also want to play innocent and pretend they have no idea how we get it. and that's more hypocrisy than i can swallow. so fuck em.}
<A>__{long look out at the city ahead.}
<C>__{will emerson }
<D>__{and tomorrow if this all goes south they'll crucify us for being reckless, but if we are wrong and everything get's back on track. they'll be laughing their arses off at us for being the biggest bunch of pussies that god ever let through the door.}

<D>__{jesus, when did you start feeling so sorry for yourself, it's unbearable... what, you think we may have helped put some people out of business today? that it's all just for naught? well you've been doing that everyday for almost forty years sam. and if all this is for naught then so is everything else out there. it's just money, it's made up, a piece of paper with some pictures on it so we don't all kill each other trying to get something to eat. but it's not wrong and it's certainly not any different today than it's ever been. ever. 1637, 1797, 1819, `37, `57,`84, 1901, `07, 1929, `37, `73, and 1987... god damn did that motherfucker fuck me up good, 92, 97, 2000, and whatever this is gonna be called. they're just the same thing over and over. we can't help ourselves, and you and i can't control it, stop it, slow it, or even ever so slightly alter it... we just react... and we get paid well for it if we're right... and get left by the side of the road if we're wrong. there's always been and there's always gonna be the same percentage of winners and losers, happy fucks and sad sacks, fat pigs and starving dogs in this world... yes there may be more of us today... but the percentages... they always stay exactly the same.}
<A>__{they stare at each other for a long beat and then tuld looks down and takes another bite. he chews. he looks up again.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{i will do it john, but not because of your little speech, but because i need the money. i'm not sure how it could possibly be after all these years, but i need the money.}
<A>__{they both look at each other again, then look over and see jared cohen walking down the dining room aisle with peter sullivan next to him.}
<C>__{sam rogers }
<D>__{you're keeping the kid?}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{keeping him? he's getting promoted. it's all hands on deck now sam, there's going to be a lot of money to be made coming out of this mess, we're going to need all the brains we can get around here.}
<A>__{they look at each other one last time then sam starts walking away and as he passes peter he just gives him a slight nod.}
<T>__{very slow fade to black: over black:}
<A>__{we hear the sound of someone digging in dirt with a shovel.}
<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior very upscale old growth suburban nyc backyard 11:00 pm 74 74}
<A>__{fade up on sam rogers standing in a hole in the backyard digging. next to him is a large black medical looking bag. he continues to dig. eventually the flood lights from the house come on and the whole back yard lights up. then the door opens and a woman in her fifties wearing a bath robe and slippers comes out onto the deck. it is sam's ex wife. mary rogers. she squints towards the back of the yard.}
<C>__{mary rogers}
<D>__{hello! ... i've called the police.}

<C>__{mary rogers}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{she comes down off the deck and walks across the lawn up next to the hole.}
<C>__{mary rogers }
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{ella died.}
<A>__{mary looks down and sees the large canine body bag.}

<D>__{well, you take care of yourself.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{is it alright if i finish up here?}
<C>__{mary rogers}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{mary walks back across the lawn into the house and turns off the lights. sam starts back in digging the ditch and starts humming a song. he keeps digging as the song he is humming then kicks in with the full version.}
