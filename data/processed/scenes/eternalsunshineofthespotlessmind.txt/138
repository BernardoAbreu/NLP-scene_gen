<A>__{the platform is crowded with business commuters. joel is among them. the platform across the tracks from them is empty. suddenly, joel turns and makes his way through the crowd. he climbs the stairs, crosses the overpass and makes his way to the empty platform. an almost empty train pulls into that platform. joel gets on the train and watches the business commuters through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the station.}
