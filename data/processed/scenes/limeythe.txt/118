<L>__{interior hallway. day.}
<A>__{thompson leads wilson past a row of windows. dockyards, harbor activity outside. toward a door with things stencilled on it. one of them: us dept. of customs.}
<L>__{interior office.}
<A>__{a man named feather. black. half sitting on the edge of a table. wilson is shown in. wilson at the door. sizes feather up at a glance.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{this is where i come in.}
<A>__{he walks confidently in. outside, through the window, an image of a foreign sports car being hoisted in the air by a crane. there's a chair. wilson sits in it. feather squints a little. seems ready to listen to whatever wilson has to say.}
<C>__{wilson }
<D>__{how's it going, squire, all right? now listen when i was in the nick second time, it was no, third. third stretch, yeah. there was this screw had it in for me. that geezer was top of my list. two years after i was slung, i saw him. he was sitting on a bench in holland park. there was no one else about. i coulda gone up behind him and snapped his fucking neck. but i left it. coulda nobbled him, but i didn't. 'cos what i thought i wanted wasn't what i wanted. what i thought i was thinking about was something else. this berk on the bench wasn't worth my time. see what i mean? it didn't matter. it meant sod all in the end.}
<A>__{feather has been listening to this, expressionless. now he raises a finger as if there's a point he wants clarified.}
<C>__{feather}
<D>__{there's one thing i don't understand.}
<P>__{(wants to make this clear)}
<D>__{the thing i don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, i can see that, i'm on your manor now, right. so there's no need to get out of your pram. i'm johnny come lately to all this. whatever the bollocks between you and this slag valentine, it's got nothing to do with me. i don't wanna know.}
<C>__{feather}
<D>__{well, i will tell you. i believe this valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{i can well believe it. i'm sure he has done, son. he's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.}
<C>__{feather}
<D>__{but i can't be sure. i don't even know who he is. he's too insulated. too many layers around him.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{your guess is as good as mine, mate. i'm here on another matter entirely.}
<C>__{feather}
<P>__{(moves to window)}
<D>__{yeah, i guess you are.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been me for the high jump.}
<C>__{feather}
<D>__{that dude who works for valentine. he's the one sent those guys after you. you know that.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{yeah. shouldn't wonder. must've done.}
<C>__{feather}
<D>__{so what's your beef, pal?}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{nothing financial. strictly personal.}
<P>__{(moves to window)}
<D>__{i can see how all this import export malarkey might give rise to confusion where i'm concerned. a foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.}
<C>__{feather}
<P>__{(looks at him)}
<D>__{it was you. downtown.}
<C>__{wilson}
<P>__{(all innocent)}
<D>__{eh?}
<C>__{feather}
<D>__{because that wasn't anything to do with me. and suspicion has been cast in my direction.}
<P>__{(pondering)}
<D>__{didn't make any sense. choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{no, i can reassure you on that pointerior valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.}
<C>__{feather}
<D>__{he'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut. didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{all of what?}
<C>__{feather}
<D>__{of the deal, man.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{oh, yeah, right. the deal.}
<C>__{feather}
<D>__{but if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{as you prefer, squire. as you prefer.}
<C>__{feather}
<P>__{(weary of his life)}
<D>__{in which case i will just do what i usually do.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{and that is?}
<C>__{feather}
<D>__{what am i doing?}
<A>__{he's standing at the window, staring out. as if wilson isn't even in the room any more. a ship being loaded out there. inspectors with clipboards. trucks like the ones we saw at that warehouse downtown.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{looking the other way.}
<P>__{(turns to go)}
<D>__{gotcha.}
