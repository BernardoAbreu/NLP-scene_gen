<L>__{interior front hall same time}
<A>__{lurch is closing the front door, looking puzzled. the family is busily decorating the house for their annual halloween festivities. all the decorations are elegant yet ancient, dusty and faded. the crystal gloves in the chandeliers have been replaced by miniature jack o lanterns. skeletons, each wearing a top hat, hang from the sconces by the nooses around their necks. there are clusters of black and orange balloons, covered with cobwebs. uncle fester and thing are draping the banisters and stairway railings with a garland made from crepe paper, dead branches and spanish moss. skulls, each holding a candle, are scattered about, on the stairs and the furniture. a stuffed, life size scarecrow leans against the stairway, with a pitchfork through its throat. a banner on the wall reads "happy halloween", and the letters drip with blood. gomez hangs upside down from the balcony. morticia hands him a decoration. granny appears from the kitchen, carrying a tray of food.}
