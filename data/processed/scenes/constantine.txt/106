<L>__{interior john's apartment later}
<A>__{pushing slowly through a lifeless apartment drawing closer to the opened bathroom door. water is pouring.}
<C>__{angela }
<D>__{do i take off my clothes or leave them on?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{john?}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{i'm thinking.}
<C>__{angela }
<D>__{john.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{on is fine.}
<L>__{interior bathroom}
<A>__{john fills a 70 year old porcelain bathtub. angela stands in the center.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{why water?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's the universal conduit. lubricates the transition from one plane to another. now ask me if there's water in hell.}
<A>__{john turns off the faucet.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{sit.}
<A>__{angela grabs his shoulder for balance, lowers herself. when she's sitting, the water is all the way to her neck.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{normally only a portion of the body has to be suspended but you wanted the crash course...}
<C>__{angela}
<P>__{(teeth chattering)}
<D>__{what will i see?}
<A>__{his eyes say it all. enough.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{lie down.}
<C>__{angela}
<P>__{(gesturing the depth)}
<D>__{lie down?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you have to be fully submerged.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{for how long?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{as long as it takes. here }
<A>__{john cups the back of her neck, holds her face just above the water as she lowers down. her breathing is picking up. john leans over the tub, looks straight down at her.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{last chance...}
<P>__{(off her look)}
<D>__{take a deep one.}
<A>__{angela takes a deep breath, holds it. john pulls his hand away and she settles to the bottom, her eyes riveted on his the entire time. angela's pov a silent john ripples above. his hand grips her arm, skin to skin.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{angela lies there and panic sets in. she starts to surface but john pushes her head back to the bottom, holds it firm. her eyes dart about. air is running out. she can't hold her breath much longer. it's not working but the room's lighting begins to pulsate as if the current were ramping down. it slows to that dim half light as john's eyes close. a single blink. angela is lying in now boiling water, screaming for all of her life. water muffles the sound but not the fury. huge tub shudders hard snapping out of the hold down bolts. john is stunned how powerful is this woman? another scream and the inch thick tub cracks. water starts streaming onto the tile. john lunges, grabs angela and pulls her up from the water her muffled screams shattering the air as her mouth breaks the surface. she slams hard against his chest arms wrapping tight fingers digging into his back leaving marks that might just scar. tub gives way and the damn breaks. john and angela go down hit the tile as one water washing over them both. angela lies there on top of john. trembling. she looks up him, eyes filled with revelation.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{all those people... so sad...}
<A>__{john nods, helping her understand.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{... i've always known... where the bad guys are... where to aim, when to duck... it's not luck... i've always known...}
<A>__{tears stream down her cheeks. john reaches out to touch her when her eyes clamp tight in pain }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{angela?}
<A>__{eyes snap open and she's off him in a second, runs out. john pries himself from the tile, goes after her.}
