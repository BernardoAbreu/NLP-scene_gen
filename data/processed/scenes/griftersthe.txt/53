<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{roy, very comfortable in pajamas and robe, sits in a wheelchair beside the bed, with magazines lying handy on the bed. myra, irritable, paces beside him.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{i don't see why you're still here. you look healthy to me.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i just do what the doctor says, babe.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{you're just comfortable, that's all. you don't even ask to go home. you just lie around, let your mama take care of you.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(truly astonished)}
<D>__{mama!}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{who else is paying for all this? you badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(insulted)}
<D>__{i will pay lilly back, don't you worry about that.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{i don't like to come here, roy. every time i do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{that's just lilly's way.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{and you never defend me. you're afraid of her.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{oh, don't be stupid.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{you're a mama's boy, if you want the truth.}
<A>__{this is so absurd, roy doesn't know how to respond.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{are you kid ? i hadn't even seen her in seven years!}
<A>__{lilly enters, smiling in self confidence. a large ugly burn is on the back of her right hand.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{should my ears be burning?}
<C>__{myra}
<P>__{(surly)}
<D>__{they might as well.}
<A>__{lilly gives her a mock admiring look.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{i heard those skirts were coming back.}
<A>__{myra's not quite up to direct confrontation with lilly. she glowers at roy instead.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{get well soon.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(easy)}
<D>__{every day in every way.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{i will see you when you get home.}
<A>__{myra stalks out. acting as though myra hadn't existed, lilly puts her bag on the bed, takes mail from it.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{what happened to your hand?}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(casually dismissive)}
<D>__{just a little accident. i went by your place, picked up your mall. just bills, i will take care of them.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i can take care of my own bills, lilly.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(indifferent shrug)}
<D>__{whatever you say. the manager says your boss called.}
<P>__{(crooked grin)}
<D>__{really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{what are you talking about? so i've got a job. so what?}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{stop kidding me! four years in a town like los ang gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? you expect me to believe that?}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(spreads hands; it's obvious)}
<D>__{it's there. the boss called, you said so yourself.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{and that dump you live in! those clown pictures on the walls!}
<A>__{this reference alerts and worries roy, which he tries to hide.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i like those.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{you do not! roy dillon? cornball clown pictures? commission salesman? it's all a front, isn't it? you're on the grift, i know you are. you're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because i wrote the book!}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{you're one to talk. still running playback money for the mob.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{that's me. that's who i am. you were never cut out for the rackets, roy, and if you }
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{how come?}
<A>__{she considers him. his expression is jaunty, daring her. she gives him a somber answer.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{you aren't tough enough.}
<A>__{he's afraid she's right. he covers the doubt with a display of self assurance.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{not as tough as you, huh?}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(dead serious)}
<D>__{no. and you have to be.}
<A>__{she holds up her burned hand, showing it to him.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{you asked me about this. you really want to know what happened?}
<A>__{he isn't sure he does; but what choice does he have?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{up to you.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{my boss is a guy named bobo justus, back in baltimore. when a long shot gets too much action, i have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{the first day of the delmar meet, there was a nag called bluebell. i should have been on it. but that was the day after you came in here, so i stuck around to see how you were gonna be.}
<A>__{he would speak protest, deny, explain, but she cuts him off.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{that was my choice, nothing to do with you. i took a chance, and it didn't work out.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{bluebell came in?}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{i sent bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets. i hoped that would cover me.}
<P>__{(shrug)}
<D>__{it didn't.}
