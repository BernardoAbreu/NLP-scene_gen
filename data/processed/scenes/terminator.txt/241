<A>__{the walls of a narrow alley, inky black, frame a police cruiser parked on the street beyond. firelight from the back of stoker's lights the street garishly. a young cop stands beside the car talking via radio with the mike cord pulled through the side window. he speaks with a distinctive twang a displaced southerner.}

<A>__{the sweeping headlights of a turning car momentarily illuminate the face of terminator, motionless in the dark right in front of us. eyes open. listening.}

<D>__{better get another truck round to this side.}
<A>__{terminator's silhouette emerges from the blackness and strides purposefully toward the cop, camera following. the officer whirls and reaches for his gun but terminator flings him brutally into the side of the car, steps over him and opens the door. before getting in he notes the unit number on the roof: 143. then he slides behind the wheel, slips the squad car into gear, and pulls out. camera preceding car, hide wide angle, as it accelerates rapidly, until the lines across the street are flashing under it in a staccato rhythm.}
