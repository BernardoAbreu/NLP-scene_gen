<L>__{exterior cottonwood golf course charity event day}
<A>__{banners and galleries and concession tents create the atmosphere of a polite circus.}
<L>__{exterior cottonwood golf course charity event 16th green}
<A>__{ day billy mayfair putts out on the 16th green to polite applause.}
<L>__{exterior cottonwood golf course 16th tee day}
<A>__{the two twosomes tee off and the caddies follow, including tin cup.}
<L>__{exterior cottonwood 16th fairway day}
<A>__{a leader board reads: simms stadler 10, mickelson mccord 8. a giant gallery lines the fairway and rings the distant green which is fronted by a lake, as: stadler hits a three wood toward the green the ball plunks in the middle of the lake. the gallery groans. stadler just shrugs to simms, as if to say, "i thought i had enough club."}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{like i told you, it was more'n you had in the bag.}
<C>__{stadler}
<D>__{yeah, well... i had to go for it after your caddy said he could get home from here.}
<A>__{simms swivels his head around to look at tin cup.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i could.}
<A>__{simms looks away, at the shot he's facing: a two hundred fifteen yard carry over water. he looks back at tin cup, shaking his head.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{i gotta hand it to you, roy. for fifteen holes you've seemed to grasp the concept here: i'm trying to win and your job is to help me.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{five percent of your earnings does numb the gag reflex.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{give me the seven iron. i'm laying up.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{you can make that shot.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{the smart play's to lay up.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{these fans didn't pay thirty bucks to watch a tour star lay up on a short par five.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{i'm sitting on a two shot lead with three to go, and my partner's in his pocket. suddenly, par's a good number. gimme the seven iron.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{no way. you're going for the green. these fans paid good money to see golf shots they can't hit, not golf shots they feel shitty about themselves for having to hit.}
<A>__{simms reaches for the seven iron. tin cup clamps a hand over the club.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{thirteen years on tour and you're still a pussy. hit the fucking one iron, dave.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{thirteen years in a driving range and you still think this game's about your testosterone count.}
<A>__{simms removes tin cup's hand from the seven iron and grabs the club, stepping up to address the ball. tin cup mutters to the gallery.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{two fifteen to carry, and the tour star's laying up.}
<A>__{and the remark summons gallery voices suddenly urging simms to go for the green. simms motions for tin cup, as if reconsidering.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{but if you're gonna editorialize, do it on the other side of the ropes. i got no qualms about firing your ass right here, right now.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{fire me? hell, i should fire you.}
<A>__{simms steps back to his ball with the seven iron, and: stadler's still standing back where he hit the shot into the lake. mickelson and gary mccord, the other team in the pairing, are there with him. romeo, stadler's caddie, stands just behind them.}
<D>__{mccord}
<P>__{(to mickelson)}
<D>__{i know you could knock it on from here, i'm just saying that caddie's been drinking muddy water if he thinks he can.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{he can.}
<A>__{all the players look at romeo as: simms dumps his seven iron shot safely down in front of the water to a smattering of polite applause. simms tosses the club back to his bag as tin cup retrieves the divot. and:}
<C>__{stadler}
<D>__{hey, dave! we in a hurry?}
<A>__{simms looks several yards back where stadler is still standing with mccord and mickelson.}
<C>__{stadler}
<D>__{'cause i just bet mccord and mickelson that your caddie could knock it on from here.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{we're trying to win a tournament, pardo.}
<C>__{stadler}
<D>__{i know. but i'm getting five to one.}
