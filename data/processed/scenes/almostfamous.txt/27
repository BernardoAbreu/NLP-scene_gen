<L>__{exterior top of sports arena ramp night}
<A>__{william inches into the realm of the girls at the top of the ramp. the wind whips. it's just him, and two groupies in their evening best. they now pretend to barely notice the young journalist who has been banished to stand with them. chattering excitedly, with sophistication far beyond her 17 years, is estrella. she sports long unruly black hair. her partner hangs in the shadows, adjusting shoes. estrella turns to the kid with great disinterest.}
<C>__{estrella}
<D>__{who are you with?}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(embarrassed to be alive)}
<D>__{me? i'm with myself.}
<C>__{estrella}
<D>__{no, who are you with?}
<A>__{what band?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i'm here to interview black sabbath.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm a journalist. i'm not a... you know...}
<A>__{estrella stares at him. moving into the parking lot light, introducing herself, is a luminous girl in a green faux fur trimmed coat. this is penny lane. there is an inviting warmth and real interest in the way she asks:}
<C>__{penny lane}
<D>__{... you're not a what?}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(enthralled)}
<D>__{oh... i'm just... not a... you know.}
<C>__{penny lane}
<D>__{not a "what"?}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(charmed)}
<D>__{you know. a "groupie."}
<A>__{the two girls are deeply insulted by the word.}
<C>__{estrella}
<D>__{ohhh!}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{sorry, i }
<C>__{penny lane}
<D>__{we. are not. "groupies."}
<A>__{estrella indicates penny with great reverence.}
<C>__{estrella}
<D>__{this is penny lane, man. show some respect.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{ sorry.}
<A>__{penny steps closer, focusing completely on the kid. behind her, concert goers throw a few woo woos their way. she seems not to hear them.}
<C>__{penny lane}
<D>__{"groupies" sleep with rock stars because they want to be near someone famous. we are here because of the music.}
<A>__{we}
<D>__{are band aids.}
<C>__{estrella}
<D>__{she used to run a school for band aids.}
<C>__{penny lane}
<D>__{we don't have intercourse with these guys. we support the music.}
<A>__{we inspire}
<D>__{the music. we are here because of the music.}
<A>__{william is nodding like a doll in a dashboard window. listening.}
<C>__{estrella}
<D>__{marc bolan broke her heart, man. it's famous.}
<C>__{penny lane}
<D>__{it's a long story. i'm retired now. i'm just visiting friends.}
<C>__{estrella}
<D>__{she was the one who changed everything. she said "no more sex, no more exploiting our bodies and hearts... "}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{right. right.}
<C>__{estrella}
<D>__{"... just blow jobs, and that's it. "}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{okay. well, see, now i get the difference.}
<A>__{shot drifts off him and picks up, out of the darkness, another breathless girl teetering on tall shoes. she is in the vicinity of 16. her black hair is cropped short and died red, just like the cover of bowie's aladdin sane. she is polexia, the voluptuous one, from riverside.}
<C>__{polexia}
<P>__{(the usual greeting)}
<D>__{it's all happening. it's all happening.}
<C>__{estrella}
<D>__{polexia!! did you tell sabbath we were going to be here?}
<C>__{polexia}
<D>__{i talked to dick with stillwater, i talked with sabbath. they're all dying to see us. it's all happening.}
<C>__{penny lane}
<D>__{this is our journalist friend. journalist friend, meet estrella starr, and polexia aphrodisia. and you are }
<C>__{william}
<D>__{william.}
<A>__{silent beat. his name lands like a thud.}
<C>__{polexia}
<D>__{here comes sabbath!}
<C>__{estrella}
<D>__{ozzy!!! tony!!! it's us!!}
<A>__{a long black limo with darkened windows swishes past, beeps twice. the metal backstage gate rises and the limo rolls inside. and then silence again. the girls do not discuss being rebuffed.}
<C>__{estrella }
<D>__{i think i saw sapphire in there.}
<C>__{polexia}
<P>__{(can't hold it in any longer)}
<D>__{okay. i was with ian hunter all night at rodney's last night. wanna see his spoo? i saved it in a baggie.}
<A>__{she opens her purse and shows the girls something inside. william edges away.}
<C>__{estrella}
<P>__{(peering into purse)}
<D>__{i'm really happy he's doing so well.}
<C>__{penny}
<P>__{(regarding what's in purse)}
<D>__{yeah. i know he's such a talented guy. i mean, look at him. who deserves it more?}
<C>__{polexia}
<P>__{(looking in purse)}
<D>__{nobody he's so sweet.}
<C>__{estrella}
<P>__{(with compassion)}
<D>__{don't you just root for him, you know. to go that little distance between good and great?}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{wait. that's not his. i would know his.}
<A>__{a very odd look on his face, william now cranes for a discreet look. what's in that purse? bam the backstage door opens out steps sapphire, 19, a tall girl with taller platforms. heavy eye makeup. her accent is texan, with odd traces of english. in one hand is a half drained bottle of champagne. in the other, a fistful of backstage passes.}
<D>__{sapphire does anybody remember laugh tah?}
<P>__{(as they turn) come and get 'em!}
<A>__{the girls scream and happily head down the ramp to sapphire. penny looks back and grabs william with a well placed arm hooked around his. he joins the clacking sea of legs moving down the ramp. sapphire slaps passes on the girls. as scotty (the keeper of the backstage list) watches, penny now slips william forward for a pass.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{oh no. not this one }
<C>__{sapphire}
<P>__{(off william)}
<D>__{who brought opie?}
<A>__{the kid looks over his shoulder. who's opie?}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{he's with us.}
<C>__{scotty}
<P>__{(hand blocking william)}
<D>__{he wasn't with you.}
<C>__{sapphire}
<P>__{(to scotty)}
<D>__{are you going to turn this into a thing?}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{all of you can wait outside! top of the ramp!}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i don't want to cause a thing. i will wait.}
<C>__{penny}
<P>__{(privately, to william)}
<D>__{i will go take care of this.}
<A>__{sadly, they leave him behind. the thundering arena sound of the collecting crowd, the p.a. system blasting yes' "roundabout"... purposeful roadies carrying guitar cases... the glimpse of backstage rock and roll... everything he wants to be a part of is on the other side of this door. and then it shuts. he stands alone. at the top of the ramp, a tour bus unloads. it reads stillwater tour 73. moving loudly out of the bus is the opening band. this is stillwater. four road weary band members, and their road manager. voices booming. russell hammond, 27, presses the buzzer with the nose of his guitar case. it's obvious from moment one. this is the star of the band, the charismatic one. he's tired. they're late. william recognizes him instantly, as the guitarist stretches. the buzzer goes unanswered. the kid is invisible to him, as the others now arrive behind russell. tour band manager dick roswell, 27, follows, loudly banging on the steel door. he has the flaxen haired look of a former hippie, but he carries the emblem of a real pro the newest silver halliburton briefcase covered with backstage passes. his direction is always forward.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{let us in, we're stillwater! we're on the show!!}
<A>__{william is surrounded by them now. they stand together under the single lightbulb, familiar faces, a live action album cover. jeff bebe the singer, his shiny black hair hanging in sheets around his head. ed vallencourt the quiet drummer, his long arms hanging limply at his sides. his is a face made for the background. larry turner the compact bass player. dick now kicks at the door with his foot, as william produces a copy of creem magazine.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(to dick)}
<D>__{hi, i'm a journalist. i write for creem magazine.}
<A>__{once again, the magazine hangs there. he can't give it away.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{the enemy! a rock writer!}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(struggling forward)}
<D>__{i'd like to interview you or someone from the band.}
<C>__{dick}
<P>__{(busy, running behind)}
<D>__{i'm sorry but could you please fuck off?}
<A>__{william blinks a little, takes it in stride. russell sizes him up, moving in the background.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{okay. okay. i could do that.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{you guys never listened to our records. you're all just frustrated musicians. do you know what your magazine said about us? what was it "the singer's incessant cater walling distracts from an assault with no clear purpose."}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(in background)}
<D>__{that was rolling stone.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{yeah. okay. fuck off anyway. we play for fans, not critics.}
<A>__{stung, william shrugs. it's been a terrible night, but at least thrillingly so.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{russell. jeff. ed. larry.}
<P>__{(can't help it)}
<D>__{i really love your band. i think the song "fever dog" is a big step forward for you guys. i think you guys producing it yourselves, instead of glyn johns, was the right thing to do. and the guitar sound was incendiary.}
<P>__{(gestures with fist)}
<D>__{way to go.}
<A>__{he turns and leaves, beginning his long trek back up the ramp. russell looks at the others. that kind of love is hard to give up.}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(good humored, yelling)}
<D>__{well don't stop there.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{yeah, come back here!! keep going!}
<A>__{they wave him back, as the backstage door opens again. the kid moves back down the ramp. they herd him in with them, through the door. scotty quickly spots the kid and squares off. russell notes the kid's swirling emotional state, shoves him forward.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{not this one.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{he's with us. scotty he's not with you.}
<A>__{he's not with them.}
<D>__{he's not on the list. he's not coming in.}
<A>__{and this is my arena. and}
<D>__{furthermore }
<A>__{russel craves the confrontation and moves forward closer to scotty.}
<C>__{scotty }
<D>__{ have a good time tonight. welcome to san diego.}
