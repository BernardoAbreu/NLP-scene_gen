<L>__{interior charles'office right after}
<A>__{charles in a meeting with several subordinates. everyone is in late night disarray. they are obviously on their way to pulling an all nighter. the door to the office flies open. tyler barges in. janine trailing.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{tyler? tyler? you can't just...}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{it's fine janine.}
<A>__{there is space between the two men. tyler extends a rolled up piece of paper to his father.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{she drew you a picture.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{put it on the table.}
<A>__{beat. tyler holds on to the portrait.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{you have a daughter who sincerely believes you don't like her.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{if i have any questions about what my daughter may believe, i will let you know.}
<A>__{tyler gestures with the portrait}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{don't you at least want to know her? she's telling you something, dad. she's communicating. why aren't you riveted? why isn't this the most important thing? at least for one night of your life?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{i've heard this song before, tyler. subordinate #1 we can come back...}
<A>__{the subordinates rise.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{it's fine, khaleel.}
<A>__{they sit. there is still distance between the two men. beat.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{who is this display for?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{you, mr. roth.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{she knows i will take care of her.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{and...?}
<A>__{the subordinates rise again.}
<D>__{subordinate #1 we really can come back another...}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{sit the fuck down.}
<A>__{they sit.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{and that i love her. i love her. good god, you toss that word around like currency. you have no idea what it means.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{maybe not. maybe caroline doesn't either. where would she have learned it?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{i have provided her world. and yours.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{that does not mean you're allowed to shatter it whenever there's something better to do.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{who the hell do you think you're talking to? you pedaled down here on your bike for christ's sake. you have to take care of nothing. you are responsible for no one. you're a kid. you think you're the first one to lose anything? do you think that there is anything you feel that i haven't already felt?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{you didn't find him. i found him. and you're so tragically blind, the rest of your children are going to hang themselves on your watch.}
<A>__{charles goes, snarling, for his son, and tyler is more than willing. janine and one of the subordinates get between them.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{stop! stop!}
<A>__{the men are pulled apart. tyler is white and trembling with rage. charles' face is completely dark and closed.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{get out of here tyler.}
<A>__{tyler runs for the door. stumbling over furniture, caroline's portrait crushed under his feet.}
