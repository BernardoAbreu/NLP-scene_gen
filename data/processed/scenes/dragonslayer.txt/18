<B>__{riders}
<A>__{three horses gallop through the moors and fens of central urland. galen is tucked up behind tyrian. on the distant horizon, the battlements of the king's castle glow in the slanting light of a new day.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{throne room day within the castle is a great hall with shafts of daylight poking in through narrow windows set high in the walls. in the middle of the room stands a carved oak throne. there is casiodorus rex, king of urland, a bearded man in his fifties, as spare and somber as the room in which he sits. he is flanked by a few servants, assorted courtiers and tyrian. standing before them all is galen, looking unhappy. he pours a pitcher full of water into a small glazed goblet.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{one of the best things about the water here in urland is that there's so much of it look at that!}
<A>__{water continues to pour into the goblet without overflowing. galen takes a sip.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{mmm. good. but not cold enough. perhaps i could borrow a scarf from his majesty.}
<A>__{the king makes no sign. galen approaches stiffly, takes a scarf and retreats.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i cover the goblet, so... remove, so... and behold: winter in a mug!}
<A>__{and he's done it: he turns the goblet over and a small chunk of ice hits the floor. the royal reaction is equally frosty. galen is bombing, and he knows it.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{all right. how many of you have ever seen a table fly?}
<A>__{he mutters an incantation. in the audience, tyrian notes that galen has his hand wrapped around the amulet. there is a loud clatter as the heavy oak table before the throne begins to jitter and buck. as the wine spills and plates go flying, the king wearily raises a hand.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{enough! that's fine.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{wait, it'll rise now.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{don't bother. not necessary.}
<A>__{the table cracks in half and dumps a mess of fruit and crockery at the onlookers' feet.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{tell me: the landslide it was accomplished this same way?}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{i see. and having rendered such unique service to our kingdom, what would you claim as a reward?}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{please no payment. i have always found magical practice to be its own reward. i seek only some yet greater challenge.}
<A>__{this handsome sentiment doesn't go over any better than his tricks.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{did you ever hear of king gaiseric? of course not, you weren't even born. he was my brother, a great king and a valiant man at arms. when he ascended to the throne, the dragon was unbridled. no one knew where it might strike nexterior so he brought forth his broadsword and his spear, assembled a company of his best fighters and went out to do battle.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{he was never seen again. but his attack provoked the most terrible reprisals: whole villages incinerated, entire crops burned. death, famine, horrible.}
<A>__{the king grimaces as the memories come flooding back.}
<C>__{king}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{how did you arrogate to yourself the role of savior?}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i was invited.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{not by me. did you ever consider the consequences of failure?}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{what failure? what's the matter with you people? you want the dragon back?}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{then the beast is dead?}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{yes, of course. dead.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{we shall see.}
