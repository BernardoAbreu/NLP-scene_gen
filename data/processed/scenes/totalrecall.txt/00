<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior desert day}
<A>__{all we can see, filling the entire frame is a flame orange sky...almost like the sky from the burning of atlanta in "gone with the wind". superimpose: presenter credit. pan down lower and lower until we see the terrain below... the desert. there is no vegetation whatever, just sand and odd shaped rock formations. the air is filled with red dust, which alternately obscures and then reveals the image. camera moves forward optically enlarging the film grain in the process.}
<B>__{slow disolve opening credits begin.}
<A>__{another shot of a barren landscape, once more with bizarre rocks. dust. sound of wind. camera moves forward again.}
<B>__{dissolve.}
<A>__{another landscape, but this time, in the distance are some enormous plastic domes. sunlight striking them and reflect ing causes brilliant rainbows. camera optically tracks toward the dome, seen in tantalizingly indistinct fashion through the red dust. dissolve... another angle, and, in the distance, on the horizon of the arid landscape is a huge sphinx like structure. (it is reminiscent of the egyptian sphinx, but both body and face, though gargoyle like, are different in design.) there are some large pyramids not far from the sphinx. camera moves optically forward. dissolve. camera is much closer to the sphinx and is directly in front. it moves (combination of zoom and optical printer move) towards the eyes, which appear to be red gems. as camera approaches one of the eyes, it appears to be stained red glass, as in a temple. suddenly there is a terrific explosion and the glass shatters into millions of fragments which hurtle toward the camera...}
