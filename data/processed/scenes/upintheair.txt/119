<L>__{interior alternate conference room, detroit company day}
<A>__{an unsuspecting man in his mid fifties enters the room and takes a seat at a computer terminal. (for the remainder of the scene, we will intercut between natalie's room and the pov of the man's ichat session.)}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{hello, mr. samuels. my name is natalie keener.}
<C>__{samuels}
<P>__{(checking out the pc)}
<D>__{what's going on here?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i wish i was here with better news, however your position here at deckers is no longer available.}
<C>__{samuels}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{you've been let go.}
<C>__{samuels}
<D>__{what, just like that? i can't believe... who are you?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{my name is miss keener. i am here to tell you about your options...}
<C>__{samuels}
<D>__{i work here for seventeen years and they send some fourth grader in here to can me? what the fuck is this?!}
<A>__{ryan fights the urge to jump in. he is sitting next to natalie, but just out of view of the camera.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{it's perfectly normal to be upset. however, the sooner you can tell yourself that there are greater opportunities waiting for you...}
<C>__{samuels}
<D>__{greater opportunities? i'm fifty seven fucking years old!}
<A>__{mr. samuels is now on the verge of tears. eyes red.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{anybody who ever built an empire, or changed the world, sat where you are now. and it's because they sat there that they were able to do it.}
<A>__{we remain in the room with natalie and ryan, but we hear mr. samuels crying. it's loud and embarrassing. it's coming from the next room. he's literally on the other side of the wall.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{there's a packet in front of you.}
<A>__{samuels picks up the packet and opens it.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{i want you to take some time and review it.}
<A>__{samuels begins to leaf through.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{all the answers you're looking for are inside those pages.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{the sooner you trust the process, the sooner your next step in life will unveil itself.}
<A>__{samuels puts down the packet. the tears still coming slowly.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{i need you to return to your office now and begin to put together your personal things.}
<A>__{samuels doesn't move. he's just sitting there in a daze.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{thank you for your time, mr. samuels.}
<A>__{no reaction. just more silent tears. natalie is getting nervous.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{mr. samuels? there's nothing else we can discuss now.}
<P>__{(and again)}
<D>__{thank you for your time.}
<A>__{ryan fights the urge to break in as natalie continues to lose her composure. craig leans into his computer, watching intently.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{mr. samuels... mr. samuels.... mr.}
<C>__{samuels...}
<A>__{finally, samuels breaks from his daze. he looks up and around for a second, then gets up and leaves. natalie catches her breath. a second later, samuels passes their room, visible through the conference room windows. they watch as he walks away.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{you did good.}
<A>__{natalie nods.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{you okay? want me to take over.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{no, i'm alright.}
<A>__{natalie pulls out a list of forty names. the amount of people is daunting. she crosses off the first name.}
