<A>__{in the b.g. we hear christine's horrific screaming. the killer hangs up. ben looks ahead, traffic is picking up. he puts the suv into gear, peels out the nearest opening, narrowly avoiding collision. his car screeches down the off ramp.}

<D>__{reaction to what?}
<A>__{ben passes under the huge, pallid "h" in the sign. what seems at first like a gentle raindrop, beads down ben's forehead. he rolls back his head, his legs turning to jelly, his eyes widening in horror.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{ohmygod! no! christine }
<A>__{has been gutted from neck to groin. she has been fastened to the cross bar in the "h" with heavy rope. her lifeless body sways ever so gently in the southern california wind. utterly horrified, ben staggers into the shadows, not seeing the ghost as he rises from the void, knife in hand. in one quick, brutal stab, the knife is driven into ben's spine. ben screams as he's turned around, face to face with his attacker.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{but i'm the killer in stab 3!}

<D>__{well i see a lot of the audience has dressed to the occasion. today we have director of the upcoming stab 3: return to woodsboro, roman bridger. why don't we give mr. bridger a nice welcome to the set of total entertainment.}
<A>__{the crowd goes wild with applause and faux knife slashes as roman bridger, ravishingly handsome, 29, tall and stocky, enters stage dressed in a flashy white suit. he sits down on a chair beside gale's desk, places a stab 3 coffee mug beside gale's hand.}

<C>__{roman}
<D>__{well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big time sunrise studio producers like i do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a walt disney picture to a tobe hooper flick.}
<A>__{roman smiles. the true costumed horror film buffs in the audience break into applause. gale, somewhat distracted, other what not caring what this second rate director has to say, gazes at a costumed individual at the far corner of the set, watching from a half open exit door. now it could be just her imagination running away with her and her atmosphere but it almost appears as if the figure is pantomiming slitting his throat with a gleaming blade. a loud buzzing o.s. gale is startled out of her skin. she looks up at a sign hanging over the stage. the word "commercial break" is illuminated in flashing red light. gale sighs, looks back to the exit. the ghost is gone. she turns to roman.}

<D>__{a trilogy?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{that's right. it's a rarity in the horror field, but it does exist, and it's a force to be reckoned with, because true trilogies are all about going back to the beginning and discovering something that wasn't true from the get go. 'godfather', 'jedi', all revealed something that we thought was true, that wasn't true. so if it is a trilogy you are dealing with, here are some super trilogy rules. one, you got a killer who's gonna be super human. stabbing him won't work, shooting him won't work, basically in the third one, you gotta cryogenically freeze his head, decapitate him, or blow him up. number two; anyone including the main character can die. this means you, sid. i'm sorry, it's the final chapter. it can be fuckin 'reservoir dogs' by the time this thing is through. number three; the past will come back to bite you in the ass! whatever you think you know about the past, forget it. the past is not at rest, any sins you think were committed in the past are about to break out and destroy you. number four,never, ever under any circumstances go running off by yourself, cause if friday the 13th has taught us anything, it's that the next time we're gonna see you, you're gonna have a fence post jutting out from your back. so in closing, let me say good luck, god speed, and for some of you, i will see you soon, cause the rules say, some of you ain't gonna make it. i didn't, not if you're watching this tape.}
