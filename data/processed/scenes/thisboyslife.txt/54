<L>__{exterior road night}
<A>__{toby moves to where the dead beaver lies on its back, its eyes open, in the red glow of the taillights. toby picks the thing up and lugs it back toward dwight, who has the trunk open.}
<L>__{interior buick night}
<A>__{dwight is still drinking, between swallows, he gives toby sneering glances. dwight is driving very fast. the road begins a series of curves. dwight doesn't slow down, and the tires begin to scream on the curves. the road runs along a steep gorge. dwight increases the speed, and the car begins to fishtail.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i'm a little sick to my stomach.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{sick to your stomach? a hotshot like you?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i'm not a hotshot.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{that's what i hear. i hear you're a real hotshot. come and go where you please, do what you please. isn't that right? yeah, regular man about town. performer, too. that right, jack? you a performer?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{that's a goddamned lie.}
<A>__{dwight keeps glancing from the road to toby, and back again.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{if there's one thing i can't stomach, it's a liar.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i'm not a liar.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{sure you are. you or marian. is marian a liar? she says you're quite the little performer. is that a lie? you tell me that's a lie and we'll drive back to seattle so you can call her a liar to her face. you want me to do that?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{then you must be the one's a liar, right?}
<P>__{(as toby nods)}
<D>__{and you're a performer?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i guess.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{you guess? you guess? let's see your act. go on. do your act.}
<P>__{(when toby is silent)}
<D>__{i'm waiting.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{sure you can.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{do me. i hear you do me.}
<A>__{again toby shakes his head, and then gasps as the car skids hideously close to the cliff's edge. dwight is oblivious to the danger.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{yeah, i hear you're good at doing me. here. do me with the lighter. go on. take it.}
<A>__{dwight holds out the velvet covered zippo, driving with one hand, and the car is all over the road. dwight puts the lighter back into his pocket. the car slows a bit.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{hotshot. you pull that hotshot stuff around me and i will break every bone in your body. you understand me?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{you're in for a change, mister. you got that? huh? you got that good?}
<P>__{(so scary)}
<D>__{you're in for a whole 'nother ballgame.}
