<C>__{guy}
<D>__{no, they're not really the same thing. reincarnation is when you come back as something different and eternal recurrence is when you}

<A>__{her voice echoes weirdly. when the echoes die down she hears something from the vent that makes her scowl: laughter. as if our guy and the clerk are having a good laugh at her expense. pissed off now, she climbs back down, and attacks the broken doorknob with renewed urgency. and finally succeeds in getting the door to open.}

<L>__{interior stranded oldsmobile night}
<A>__{the interior is dark. the girl has been thrown under the dash. it's hard to tell in this light whether she's still breathing. finally she stirs, disoriented. she climbs back into her seat, piecing together where she is. it takes her a beat to remember him. she looks over slowly. he's not moving, though thanks to his seatbelt he's still upright behind the wheel. his head rests limply against the driver's window, which now looks out on nothing but snowbank. a link of blood trickles down the glass. dead? she's not taking any chances. without a sound she slips into her shoes, coat. gropes for her cellphone among the detritus at her feet. suddenly he stirs, groaning. she freezes. the seconds ticking by on the dashboard clock. when he doesn't wake, she resumes fumbling for her cell. finds it. then eases open the creaky passenger door. and launches herself into the frigid night.}

<D>__{i don't know. think i hit my head.}
<A>__{he puts his hand to the left side of his skull and pushes on it. like someone testing a melon for ripeness. come to think of it, his speech is a little wooden. she watches as he turns and takes a few aimless steps away.}

<C>__{girl}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{guy}

<C>__{guy}

<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{yeah, but you can still see our tracks.}
<A>__{the mystery of the missing tracks seems to have penetrated his post accident fog, bringing him back into sharper focus. she watches as he walks out in front of the olds' headlights to the middle of the road, where the other vehicles track's should be.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{what the hell?!}
<A>__{he walks back to the olds and opens the passenger door (the only access into or out of the stranded car, thanks to the snowbank). he begins searching the glove compartment for a flashlight.}
<B>__{angle on her}
<A>__{deliberating whether to seize this moment of distraction to make a break for it. she looks back down the long dark road. looks back at him bent over rummaging in the oldsmobile. too risky. curiosity getting the better of her, she walks out to the middle of the road to have a look for herself. no tracks. just an expanse of fresh powder and a few of his footprints.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{this doesn't make any sense...}
<A>__{at that moment he emerges from the car with a flashlight. he spokes it, sweeps the strong beam over their surroundings. the left side of the road falls off into a darkness so deep even the flashlight's beam can't penetrate it. a precipice. he cups his hand and calls out at the top of his lungs.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{hello!}
<A>__{she jumps at the sound of his voice, her nerves frazzled.}
<C>__{guy }
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{anybody out there!? anyone?! hey!}
<A>__{his voice is swallowed by the dark. after the echoes subside the only sound in the hush is the sizzle of falling snow and a weird otherworldly hum. he snaps off his flashlight, thrusts it into his coat pocket.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{what now?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i guess we see how bad we're stuck.}
<A>__{they trudge back to the car, boots crunching in the snow.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{you steer, i will push.}
<A>__{he holds the passenger door for her while she scrambles in, scooting over into the driver's seat. he leaves the door open so they can communicate. he walks back to the rear of the stranded oldsmobile. he's pulling on gloves when something half buried in the snow nearby catches his eye. he takes out the flashlight, shines it at the roadside. little wooden crosses. just two this time. another sad shrine, to a different set of anonymous victims of route 606. their proximity to the stranded olds obviously unsettles him.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(calling)}

<A>__{he bends with a little wince and braces his shoulder against the rear bumper.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{ready!}
<A>__{the tail lights come on as she turns the ignition. he hears her crank the starter motor. cranking... cranking... cranking... finally turning over. she slips the oldsmobile in gear, and he starts pushing. the rear tires spin, throwing slush; but car won't budge.}
<C>__{guy }
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{give it more gas!}
<A>__{she floors it; the tires screaming. he puts everything he's got into pushing, but it's no use. suddenly his face contorts in pain and he clutches his side. he drops out of view, disappearing in a cloud of red exhaust. a beat later he pulls himself up, pounds on the trunk.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{the tires stop spinning.}
<L>__{interior stranded oldsmobile night}
<A>__{she's sitting in the driver's seat of the idling car when she hears the crunch crunch crunch of his approaching footsteps. in that moment she makes a decision. scrambles across the front seat, pulls the door shut hard.}

<C>__{guy }
<D>__{you wanna pop the locks?}

<C>__{guy }
<D>__{you gonna unlock the door or what?}
<A>__{she sees him cup his hands and peering in through the window. she keeps her eyes down, focuses on her shaking fingers as they frantically dial her cellphone. no signal.}

<D>__{hey, c'mon, it's freezing out here!}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{better get used to it, asshole.}

<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i thought i was driving you home.}

<D>__{you're not driving me home because one, you don't live near my home and two, this piece of shit isn't driving anywhere. now what are we doing here? why did you get off the highway?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i told you, this is a shortcut. anyway, you were the one who said she was so bored on the highway. this used to be called `scenic 606' because there's an amazing view of the valley }

<D>__{one, you've never been anywhere near here before so don't pretend you knew it's a shortcut, and two, there's an amazing view of shit because it's pitch black out!}

<C>__{girl}
<D>__{exactly.}
<A>__{he straightens, exasperated, puts a hand to his injured head. she looks at him standing there, hugging himself against the sub zero cold, his teeth chattering. he doesn't look like an ax murderer. she doesn't know what to do. there's a long beat. finally, he throws up his hands in disgust, decides to go to plan b.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i'm gonna walk back to the gas station for help. you've got the heater and the radio, so you should be all right here. though i really think you should consider coming with me.}

<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{i bet you do.}
<A>__{he looks in at her one last time, exits. she listens to the crunch of his footsteps until she can't hear them anymore. suddenly there's a loud bang against the passenger side window. she jumps.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{but it's my car!!}
<A>__{he goes crazy on the stranded olds: punching the roof, jerking the door handle, kicking the door, screaming at her the whole time. she cowers inside, scared to death. finally he gives up, and with a final bang to the roof, exits. he turns and heads back down the road. we watch through the rear window as he trudges robotically away, his boots crunch crunch crunching in the snow. he stops. leans his weight against a tree. looks back at the car. whatever it is he's doing, he's clearly not walking to the gas station. he straightens, and continues on until he's out of sight.}
<L>__{exterior stranded oldsmobile roadside night}
<A>__{the stranded oldsmobile sits on the roadside, engine running, hood and windshield covered in white. the interior lights are on, giving it an enchanted look, like a cottage in a grimm's fairytale.}
<L>__{interior stranded oldsmobile night}
<A>__{she's in the back seat ransacking his suitcase and other possessions, looking for the duct tape. despite the heater it's cold enough in the car (thanks to the gap in the window) to see her breath. a public service announcement plays on the car's radio.}

<D>__{... the national weather service has issued a winter storm warning for the entire eastern seaboard...}

<D>__{... carbon county residents can expect snow accumulations of four to six inches...}
<A>__{suddenly we see a blur of movement outside the car's foggy rear window... but she's too busy searching through the junk in the back seat to notice. finally she finds what she's looking for: silver duct tape. also a pair of scissors. she holds the scissors like a dagger, clearly thinking they could come in useful if she needs to defend herself. she climbs up front, rips off a three foot length of tape. again, in the b.g. more movement outside the car... but she's too busy sealing the passenger's side window against the frigid draft to notice that someone's outside.}

<D>__{as wind chills plunge to fifteen below overnight...}
<A>__{finally she glimpses movement outside the passenger window. she gasps, ducking out of sight below the car's dashboard. she doesn't move, listening, her eyes bright with fear. after a long beat she risks a peek over the steering wheel. the windshield is fogged, so she wipes a peephole in the condensate. it's too dark to see much beyond the car's hood. she reaches shaking fingers toward the steering column. flicks on the headlights. a stranger is walking away down the middle of the dark road. she screams, reaches instinctively to check the power locks. the stranger, a black man dressed in a dirty suit, walks with hunched shoulders. snow swirling around him in the darkness. who the hell takes a stroll in the middle of a snowstorm? over her initial shock now, she reaches for the door handle.}
<L>__{exterior route 606 roadside night}
<A>__{she gets out of the car, clutching the scissors in both hands like a dagger. she stands behind the protection of the open car door and calls out to the stranger moving down the middle of the snowy road a dozen yards ahead. there's a weird humming noise in the air she can't place.}

<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{no reaction from the stranger.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{hello? do you live around here?}

<C>__{girl }
<D>__{we had an accident. my friend went for help. he'll be back any second.}
<A>__{the stranger's dapper suit is more than dishevelled. it's soaking wet, caked in motor oil or some other dark slime.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{kinda crappy night for a walk, don't you think?}
<A>__{and there's something definitely "off about his shuffling. it's like he's crippled, or injured. in fact he seems to be crying. (or is it moaning?)}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{hey, wait!}
<A>__{but the stranger just keeps shuffling toward the shoulder of the road, headed in the direction of the dark stand of trees beyond. soon he moves beyond the reach of the headlights and disappears into the gloom.}

<A>__{he turns and trudges back to the oldsmobile, climbs in, and pulls the door shut after him. leaving her there in the snowy road, clutching the scissors, her teeth chattering. she stands there, shivering, looking very small and alone. hold on her as she weighs her options: stay out here and freeze. or risk seeking shelter with a stalker. not much of a choice.}
<L>__{interior stranded oldsmobile moments later}
