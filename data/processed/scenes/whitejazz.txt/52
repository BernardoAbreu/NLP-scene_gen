<L>__{interior bedroom continuous}
<A>__{inside. move fast now. a fist sized lump swells mid chest, blossoms into my throat. i don't want to see what i know is there. turn the corner: club alabam songbird tilly hopwell. three breaths from death. a spike snapped off in her greyish, motionless left arm. her right hand claws at tile. these beautiful dark eyes stare up at me like she was hoping for someone sooner. throttle marks on her neck, one breast exposed, bra pulled down for a grope. i don't want to touch her face but i do...she closes her eyes the moment my fingertips hit. that gases my hate. choke back sudden tears.}
<C>__{voice behind me}
<D>__{fuck you doin'?}
<A>__{turn back. greaser in the doorway, brown bagged t bird hits the floor as he reaches for his waist stand and shoot him in the throat. drive the .45 into his sternum like a blade before i fire the second third fourth shots. he falls flails. jump shock from the other room.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{police!}
<A>__{bodies scramble. no words. just pistol fire through the half rotted walls punks taking potshots. no compliance means i hit the hallway shooting back. firing dead bang at a couple fleeing silhouettes see them pop stumble fall the archway above my head shreds, collapses. somebody firing a sub machine gun. flat on my ass, my back finds the wall, cough up plaster, sleeve my eyes to see. then quiet, save the rattle clap of changing clips.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{put that god damn gun dow }
<C>__{tommy magdalena }
<D>__{ you set me up you cocksucker!}
<A>__{machine gun fire lights up my left side. roll. taste floor grime as subsonic zips snap close...bullets miss by inches.}
<C>__{tommy magdalena}
<D>__{ rat fuck cop! you killed him wilhite!}
<A>__{every part of me pauses...`wilhite'...back door gets blunted open, frantic footfalls recede. that big bent v 8 on tommy's `32 deuce roars to life. up now, plow through the cloud of cordite. see one of tommy's pachucos propped up against the wall, unhit, unhurt. point my .45 and pull the trigger a i pass. hit an empty chamber...this punk's lucky day.}
