<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{the party walks towards a big double door behind which a single voice preaching can be vaguely heard. nguni knocks on the door.}
<L>__{exterior soccer field}
<A>__{the doors open to an entire soccer field jammed with humanity. a boxing ring is raised in the center. the only lights in the area directly over it. with the twelve witnesses in the lead, the party makes its way through a path in the crowd. an old woman with a fly switch, not unlike inkosikazi's, speaks from the ring. as pk passes the whispers start.}
<C>__{whispers}
<D>__{onoshobishobi.}
<A>__{the woman in the ring begins to chant. the crowd picks it up.}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{onoshobishopi ingelosi. shobi shobi ingelosi.}
<A>__{pk looks back at maria who is a bit unnerved, as are morrie and solly. he looks across at mandoma whose face is a mask looking straight ahead, betraying nothing. the two men climb into the ring and stand in their corners. the old woman shuffles over and peers into pk's face. she mutters something inaudible, then turns to the crowd.}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{onoshobishobi ingelosi.}
<A>__{the crowd picks up the chant. she waves and the crowd goes silent. somewhere in the darkness a single voice begins to sing "nkosi sikelel i afrika" the african national anthem. the crowd picks it up. pk looks down to the front row where nguni sits courteously attending to maria in a seat of honor among the twelve men in suits. the african national anthem finishes. the bell rings three times. the old woman is led from the ring. an indian referee in all white enters the ring and waves the two fighters forward.}
<C>__{referee}
<D>__{you are listening to me please. when i am shouting break, you must break at once. when a knockdown is coming, it is for an eight count. no heads, no elbows. you fight clean or by golly i am giving you penalty points. good luck, boys.}
<A>__{pk and mandoma touch gloves and go to their respective corners.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{what do you see?}
<A>__{solly watches mandoma dancing across the ring.}
<C>__{solly}
<D>__{a very tough fight.}
<A>__{the bell rings.}
<C>__{solly}
<D>__{watch the left hook.}
<A>__{mandoma comes charging across the ring and begins to fire everything in his arsenal at pk, overwhelming him. pk cannot get away from him and takes a series of devastat ing combinations which end in a left hook to pk's jaw. pk drops like lead. the referee starts counting. pk shakes his head clear and rises at eight. the referee checks his gloves. there is a cut under his right eye.}
<C>__{referee}
<D>__{continue.}
<A>__{again, mandoma comes charging hard. pk defends himself as best he can, trying to counter. but mandoma's offense won't allow it. he beats on pk until the round ends. pk sits down in his corner. morrie works on his eye.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{god, he hits like a truck.}
<C>__{solly}
<D>__{he's going for the quick knockout. he can't keep it up. soon the truck runs out of gas.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{if he catches me again like that i will run out of gas permanently.}
<A>__{the bell sounds. pk is hardly off his stool when mandoma is on him, pummeling him. pk backpedals, bobs and weaves. mandoma's punches come fast and furious, each one looking to end the fight. mandoma gets pk against the ropes and bangs away. pk covers up. mandoma punishes his arms and kidneys. pk swings back and es capes. mandoma pursues him. he catches pk with a body chop and then a chopping left. pk goes down again. the referee starts to count. the crowd is completely silent. the bell rings. pk returns to his corner, shaking his head, trying to clear it. he flops onto his stool.}
<C>__{solly}
<D>__{he's had it. he's got no strength in his punch.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{could've fooled me.}
<C>__{solly}
<D>__{i'm telling you.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{tell him.}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{look he's taking water.}
<A>__{they all look.}
<B>__{their pov}
<A>__{of mandoma, breathing heavily, sweating profusely, drinks deeply from his water flask.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{solly}
<D>__{see. where that water goes you go. right to here.}
<A>__{he pokes pk's belly.}
<C>__{solly}
<D>__{you put your punches there, you win. you don't, you lose.}
<A>__{the bell rings. mandoma comes charging out. pk goes on defense. he hits mandoma hard to the head. mandoma whips around and hits him hard. pk spins and hits the canvas. his vision blurs, doubles. the sound of a waterfall fills his head.}
