<L>__{interior lobruto's office soon after}
<A>__{district attorney joe lobruto, 50 ish, sits behind a massive oak desk, studying a thick file. doesn't look up as a secretary shows willy in. willy hesitates. looks around: he's never been here. flags, wood panelling, leather furniture, windows overlooking the city. finally lobruto looks up, takes willy in.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{william no middle initial slocum.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{sit.}
<P>__{(as willy does:)}
<D>__{eighty four percent conviction rate. that's remarkable.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{with a case load thirty percent higher than any other first year dda.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{of course you also swapped more cases than the rest of them put together.}
<A>__{willy considers his options. he always does.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i offered my losing cases in exchange for two or three of anyone else's possible convictions. they couldn't handle their workloads, and i prefer not to lose.}
<A>__{lobruto knew this; the question was would willy admit it.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{you're going to need a middle initial.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{you're going to wooton sims.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{in two weeks.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{you'll be able to afford a better suit. but those guys all play squash and have middle names. they go in for the mother's maiden name a lot.}
<A>__{beat. willy doesn't like the implied personal judgement, but the only way it shows is how calm he stays.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{my mother didn't have a maiden name.}
<A>__{lobruto nods, unruffled by willy's hard calm.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{so you're a bastard; sometimes i can be a son of a bitch. maybe you belong here.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i didn't work this hard to stay where i belong.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{you're a street fighter, willy. you should be in court. we can move you up to better cases.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i appreciate the offer.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{i didn't think so.}
<P>__{(closes the file, stands)}
<D>__{well you got your litigation experience. your chops. and your juicy private sector job. anything else the city of los angeles can do for you?}
<A>__{willy's amused. he stands, too. as they shake hands:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{no, i think that's everything thank you.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{the offer stands. if you get tired of carrying a spear.}
<A>__{willy nods but lobruto notes the tiny flicker in his eyes: not getting it and trying to cover. lobruto smiles gently.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{it's an opera joke. give my regards to bob.}
