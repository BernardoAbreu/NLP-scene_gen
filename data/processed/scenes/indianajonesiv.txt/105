<A>__{the tank has nearly made it to the top of the mountain. trekking through a narrow, rocky ravine. the tank rolls to a stop. the top hatch flips open. indiana, scraggy and tyki pop out. tyki suddenly points to the mountain top, which is cloaked in thick layers of clouds. tyki's eyes fill with joyous tears. he begins to shout. his voice squeals with excitement. scraggy translates for indy.}
