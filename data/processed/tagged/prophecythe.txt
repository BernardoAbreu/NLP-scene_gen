<T>__{fade up on:}
<A>__{a howling dust storm battering the doors and walls of a tiny woodplank church. inside, huddled together against the rage outside, are a small group of people. all in black, mostly elderly, they kneel in prayer. before them, on the cramped altar, lies a man. dressed in the uniform of a general, surrounded by the silk softness of his casket. he's an old man, far from the crump of battles, consumed now with stillness, listening to the prayers of old people. of desert wind, moaning through thin wood. the candle beside his head flickers and wanes in the ceaseless gusts, strains for life, then goes out.}

<L>__{exterior downtown los angeles night}
<A>__{it's not the best part of town and probably never was. a place of seedy, anonymous brick flophouses shackled by rusting fire escapes, lying on an alley unique only for its bad drainage. it's here, in the dim, flinty light, that a figure enters. wearing a long coat and, despite the night, sunglasses, he pauses on the slimy asphalt and gazes up the sides of the flophouses, to their yellowish windows and competing mexican radio stations. one window, dark and quiet on the third floor, catches his gaze. there's a metal hand railing in the alley that the long coated figure effortlessly pops up onto. sunglasses focused on the window, he lowers himself into a motionless crouch, a perch, on the railing with the ease of a crow. or a gargoyle.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{dawn is a muddled, limp thing that does nothing to improve the alley. the figure is still there, a motionless gargoyle perched on the railing. watching the window. the shadows shorten, the air grows warmer, and now there's movement behind the window. the sunglassed gargoyle drops down off the railing, jumps up to the first rung of the fire escape, and begins climbing.}
<B>__{behind the third floor window}
<A>__{is a room as grim as we expect. lumpy iron bed, sink that's been pissed into one too many times, and simon; a man in a tight sweater and dark sunglasses, busily emptying his pockets on the ruined dresser: loose change, a town paper's obituary column. simon's sunglassed eyes look up suddenly, his body stifffening. he whips around to face the window just as it explodes into fragments. the gargoyle leaps into the room on the trail of glass. simon spins and throws himself against the intruder. the two struggle savagely across the room, smashing chairs. simon manages a grip on the gargoyle's face and pounds the back of his skull against the wall. the gargoyle gets his locked fists up and swings them like a war club, smacking simon's face and sprawling him backwards onto the bed. the two, across the room for each other, pause.}
<C>__{gargoyle}
<D>__{where is it?}
<A>__{simon's climbed to his feet, the two men in sunglasses now walking slow circles around each other.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{leave me alone.}
<C>__{gargoyle}
<D>__{you've found it, haven't you?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<A>__{the gargoyle drops his head and drives himself into simon, who hammers the gargoyle with his fists. blood smears. the gargoyle's gotten free a knife that he jams into simon's leg. pressing home his advantage, the gargoyle slams simon up against the wall. he tears open simon's shirt, digging his fingers into the chest, ripping the skin aside, the first plunging deep, cracking the sternum bone, pushing even further, toward the blood gouged pumping beneath simon plows his knee up between the gargoyle's legs. over and over. till the grip loosens and simon shoves him to one side, using the momentum and drives to swing the body around and at the shattered window. the gargoyle smacks the frame and collapses, his head cracking on the sill and forcing a shard of glass through his neck. simon moves to the window and brushes aside the gargoyle's sunglasses, revealing two totally empty eye sockets. pushing his thumbs into them, simon uses the leverage to lift the gargoyle off the sill and push his body out the window. the gargoyle bounces once on the fire escape, then spread eagles thirty feet to the asphalt. somebody turns up their mexican radio station. the gargoyle's a wreck. but he manages, slowly his shattered remains arguing every inch to climb first to his knees, then miserably to his feet. a bent, splattered, hopeless thing that manages to stumble three or four feet before being hit by a freeway speed firebird bombing down the alley. the impact pins the gargoyle to the grill and rams him into a brick wall, crushing a chest that belches out a sickly, bruised heart like a wet rag against the firebird's windshield.}
<B>__{three floors above}
<A>__{simon leans against his splintered window and looks down at the pinned and very finished body of the gargoyle. his own shirt and pants are a mess of torn blood and his breathing is difficult. pain flashes across his forehead as he checks that his own sunglasses still sit snugly on the bridge of his nose. at the sound of a distant siren simon turns and quickly finishes packing his duffle bag. stiffly pulling on an oversize surplus army jacket that partly conceals the damage beneath, he picks up the bag and painfully shuffles out.}

<B>__{on the edge of town}
<A>__{from the inky oblivion of the road, comes a crunch of gravel.}
<B>__{on the other side of town}
<A>__{stands a large, nineteenth century brick schoolhouse. an icon from a more prosperous past, its dark massiveness was meant for scores of ruddy faced miner's kids. now it seems to be imploding, eating itself with creeping decay. on this night it is silent and dark but for a small glow in one corner and the faint sound of children's voices in song. it is a hymn. an ancient, latin one. the melancholy beauty of voices rising and falling in choir.}
<B>__{inside the building}
<A>__{is a school auditorium. on the stage, dwarfed by it, are twenty five students from first grade to high school, singing together as a choir. a young woman, katherine, directs their acapella voices as the small group of parents, lonely in the huge room, look on.}

<B>__{in the school auditorium}
<A>__{young voices struggle with the complicated hymn and its pain of centuries. faces white, mexican, navaho. katherine guides them with soft hands. she smiles in pride. they smile back. proud. of her. of themselves and the beauty coming from their mouths. one small, beautiful navaho girl, mary, maybe eight, gets a special smile of special friendship from katherine. the mortuary's front door now stands ajar in the darkness. small shards of glass glisten in the carpet.}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{is the dead general. even in the bleached ravages of age and death, his face still holds a shadow of vigor and pride. it takes a moment in the weak flicker of the candle to realize someone is there with him. simon in his oversized surplus jacket. his arms are folded tightly across his middle, as if in deep cold. but his gaunt face is moist with sweat and his breath is shallow and uneven. he stares at the old man behind sunglasses and takes slow, cautious steps forward into the amber glow. holding out two blood stained fingers, simon touches the general's forehead. a new strain crosses his perspiring face. concentration. placing his right palm on the general's chin and the left on his forehead, simon cracks open the dead man's mouth.}
<B>__{in the school auditorium}

<B>__{inside}
<A>__{he climbs a littered and disused staircase, past broken beer bottles and condom wrappers to a dark and creaky second floor. it's part of the school building long abandoned. doors to classrooms lie half off their hinges, windows are broken, rats squeak between ancient desks stacked like funeral pyres. simon, his breath echoing in the cold darkness, shuffles along the broken linoleum till he comes to a rectangle cut in the wall where a row of lockers used to be. he crawls into the space and there, surrounded by rot, curls up on himself and sucks his thumb.}

<P>__{(reading from slip of paper)}
<D>__{"and as in the first war, the angels so fought over the nature of their god, and there was much vanity and destruction in heaven. for some angels called their lord the son of god, and others called him the begotten father of jesus christ." what do you think?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i've never heard that quote before. theologically, the "first war" obviously refers to the war in heaven where michael the archangel threw out satan and his gang. old time bible stuff. but this implies there was a second war. that's news to me.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{and the rest of it?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{oh, it's a fairly common theological debate. or was. the idea that if christ is god's son, does that make him less than god or are they the same being in different forms. that very argument almost tore the early christian church apart in the 4th century. that was the good old days when people actually worried about theology. anyway, it was settled when the bishops of the world got to together at the council of nicene in 325 and hashed out the various interpretations of scripture into a uniform dogma of belief. the result was the nicene creed, which basically said that christ was in fact the same as god and was owed the same power and respect as the father. that they were the same.}

<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{do you think it's possible that john might have written that extra chapter?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{who knows? vichini was the greatest biblical scholar of the age, some claimed he made his own translations from the original writings. maybe he did find some unknown writings by john. it's possible i suppose. john always was a little negative about angels. all this actually has something to do with an lapd murder?}

<D>__{i hate to break it you, but that particular family spat has been settled for 1,600 years. nobody loses sleep over it anymore. honest.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{what did john have against angels?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{oh, he didn't trust them much. all that running around smiting and killing in the name of the lord. god's wild bunch. he thought it made them fickle and vain. one click above ghosts. satan didn't help the image much either.}

<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{when i was younger i used to believe that no matter how much you mucked around in your life, one day, if you listened hard enough, a voice would tell you what you were really cut out to do. and when it didn't show up on schedule i decided to go look for it. and i looked in a lot of places, believe me. i drove that road out there so far that the end became the beginning again. and it was when i got here that i realized there never was going to be a voice. so i stopped looking and took the first job they offered me. that make any sense to you?}

<A>__{ that could easily belong to a bum. it's gabriel and jerry's digs. just the moldy blanket, single oil lamp, piles of twinkie wrappers, and something else. from outside the cave it's the same whine, the same blurryness that drips off gabriel like sweat. but once they step into the room, into the lair, it suddenly jumps in volume. this is where gabriel sleeps, and it's thicker here, like honey on the walls. thomas has difficulty focusing his eyes.}
<C>__{katherine}

<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{...yes.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{but thomas can't hear katherine anymore, her voice has disappeared beneath the whine. as it becomes too much he leans his weight against the rock wall and shuts his eyes. it's then they come. flashes of images: of screams and fire. of impossible vistas of emptiness and death. and shrieking overhead, shrieking everywhere; grotesque, winged creatures with no eyes. some with faces we know; gabriel, simon, and the gargoyle. all these images are being jammed into both their minds by the cave. thomas forces his eyes open but the scenes playing all around him won't go away. tears are running down katherine's face as she stands there locked in the same images. thomas stumbles about the room as if drunk, the visions, incomprehendibly black visions of war and destruction on an alien plateau, eat his brain. he sinks to his knees and begins to cry.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{oh no... oh god no...}
<A>__{katherine's curled up on the floor like a child, weeping. the images are driving them mad. thomas, fighting the insanity pounding at him, crawls pathetically across the floor to the oil lamp. his fingers grasp it spasmotically as he rises to his knees and leans back.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{he heaves the lamp against the cave wall, where it explodes, the oil erupting into a swirling blaze that consumes the corner. the images break a second in the heat and light and sucking wind. just long enough for thomas to grab katherine's arm and pull her out of the room.}
<L>__{exterior mine day}
<A>__{katherine and thomas lie in the dust outside the mine's tunnel entrance. catching their breath. trying to organize and repair the short circuits in their brains. thomas rolls on his side, squints at the sun. katherine's voice is faint and raspy.}

<D>__{what... what was that? hell?}
<C>__{daggett}

<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{thanks man, i appreciate it. you're a sport.}

<C>__{gabriel}

<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{go. go!}
<A>__{katherine disappears through the bedroom doorway. gabriel spins around and stands. thomas leaps from a ragged crouch, hitting gabriel low with a body block. it's like butting concrete. gabriel picks up thomas by the scruff of the neck and heaves him through the flimsy room paneling. thomas crashes with a mass of splinters into the kitchen. he stumbles backward hopelessly as gabriel peruses him through the trailer. he desperately throws pots, glasses, anything at gabriel. finally trapped, he scrambles up onto the dinner table, scattering salt and sugar bowls, and dives through the levored window.}

<A>__{katherine huddles mary close to the ground as flaming chunks whack everywhere. gabriel is hammered to the earth and disappears in the rolling fire cloud. thomas, further away, is knocked head over heels in the ruddy dust. the fire cloud dissipates quickly into the sky, leaving behind scorched brush, and little else, crackling softly. gabriel's body looks blackened and still. katherine rushes to thomas, who's pulled himself up to his knees, a ragged slice above his eye bleeding badly. she helps him to his feet and over to the pickup, where he sits down against the tire as katherine pulls out her first aid kit. mary's there, standing with her shaken grandmother.}

<D>__{this may be your last chance to tell it.}
<A>__{a wind outside rustles through the hogans.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{the other night, you were talking about waiting for a voice to call you to something. well, let me tell you, the worst thing that can happen to you is to be called to something. since i can remember a voice from somewhere deep in the church called me. so loud and so often that by thirteen i knew i was going to be a priest. you know what that's like? my parents, friends, all of them thought i was crazy. but see, i had this voice. the voice that kept coaxing me along, telling me there was a reason. so i entered the seminary and was half way to my starched white collar when my mother, father, and my little brother were wiped out in a car crash.}
<A>__{he pauses, the old emotions creeping back up on him.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{i had never asked anything of the voice. not when the neighborhood kids made fun of me, not when my father looked down at me like some knock kneed faggot. i never questioned a damn thing. but on the morning i spent looking down at three parallel graves, i asked it one question. why. why were these people taken from me? and the voice, that same voice that would wrench me out of my sleep some nights with its jabbering, it was suddenly stone silent. it was the only question i ever asked of it and it just left me hanging in the fucking wind...}
<A>__{he blinks back the tears welling in his eye.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{so after that i traded in priest school for homicide school. because if god wouldn't talk to me the devil sure as hell would, and his ways were a lot easier to understand.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{we've never seen god, have we? not in any of this.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{yeah, he's certainly a shy son of a bitch, i will give him that.}
<C>__{katherine}

<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{and he's on her. with his left arm he brutally forces her to her knees as his right hand, palm out and fingers splayed, clamp themselves over her face. katherine's mouth opens in a silent scream as the pain, immediate and beyond endurance, flows through her body. from somewhere outside, there's a sound. katherine gulps chokes of agony as her very clothes begin to smolder around her. we hear the sound once more, closer, before the entire kiva wall explodes inward as katherine's pickup crashes through it. the mangled grill and hood slam into gabriel from the side and smash him to the ground like a broken puppet. katherine falls backward to the floor, gets up, and runs to the truck's cab. inside sits a near catatonic thomas. katherine takes only a second to share a look with him before reaching back and pulling out the pickup's tire iron. gabriel, a shattered, broken thing, pulls himself up to his knees. the sunglasses are gone and two eyeless pits stare out at mary, huddled in the corner. bleeding from every pore, one arm bent back the wrong way, he crawls across the floor toward her, his voice the milky slur of a stroke victim.}

<A>__{she hits him again with the tire iron. then lifts it high once more above her head. she's going to crush him, to implode his skull. when a hand stops her. sort of a hand. a claw. lucifer's. he's standing behind her, holding the raised bar still.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{katherine releases the bar and lets it clang to the floor. lucifer turns to the villagers, gazing fearfully at him as they awkwardly try to finish the chant.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{please. go on.}
<A>__{lucifer's gaze falls on a deeply fucked up gabriel who groans at the sight of him.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{oh man, this just isn't my day.}
<A>__{lucifer kneels down beside him. katherine instinctively starts to reach for the tire iron but the sycophant hisses a liquid, chattering warning at her.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{long time.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{the world's young, man.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{and full of ambition.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{this isn't your war.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{but i remember the last one. michael's war.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you lost.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{but lots of angels were with me. every one followed their leader out of heaven.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{yeah yeah, i was there, remember?}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{except one. oh, he was with me all right. he hated the eagle scout. envied the power he gave to his son. but this angel never came out front during the war. and when it ended he thought maybe, maybe the eagle scout didn't notice. so he laid low and towed the company line till he could start his own war. it was all just jealousy.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you're dreaming.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{but maybe he did notice. maybe that's why i'm here.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{ stay away from me.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{you've always been a part of me, gabriel. and now it's time to come home.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<A>__{lucifer slams gabriel's head against the floor and pins it. as the angel thrashes furiously, lucifer forces his arm into gabriel's chest. gabriel cries out as lucifer pulls his arm half out and forces it deeper. again. and again. soon gabriel's screams become giggles, then a crazed, hysterical laughter. the room goes insane. an impossible nightmare of chanting navahos, glaring headlights, and gabriel's echoing laughter as lucifer pumps his chest. laughter that rises to a kind of orgasmic cry then instantly stops as lucifer pulls out the angel's heart, and eats it. at that instant grey horse places his hand on mary's forehead, speaks a last line, and the chant is completed. sticky, smoky, awful silence. gabriel is a non thing. a battered, hollow shell. bartholomew grey horse, his voice cracked and finished, turns to katherine.}
<C>__{grey horse}
<D>__{the enemy spirit is gone.}
<C>__{daggett}
<P>__{(weak, faint)}
<D>__{where?}
<A>__{from outside the kiva suddenly comes the sound of a wounded, savage growl. katherine walks to the doorway. just outside a lone coyote is twisting in the dirt with furious agony. abruptly its thrashings cease. the animal stands and flashes for an instant at katherine cold yellow eyes more than animal. then it's gone into the blackness. forever. she turns and goes back to thomas in the cab. bleeding to death is a real possibility for him. she pulls an old shirt out of the back and tries to makeshift a wrap for his sliced arm.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{more will come... to look for the soul...}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{and they won't find it. not in mary.}
<A>__{a few of the village elders appear at the cab.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{can you help him?}
<C>__{villager}
<D>__{we have some bandages.}
<A>__{katherine walks over to where mary, sweaty and shaken, sits huddled in a corner attended by grey horse.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{are you all right, pumpkin?}
<A>__{mary's voice shakes as tears roll out her eyes.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i'm okay.}
<A>__{katherine gathers her up into her arms and holds her.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{it's going to be okay... we're all going to be okay...}
<A>__{the chattering, hissing sycophant grabs gabriel's body by the hair and shoulders and drags it out the door. lucifer has remained behind, crouched on his haunches, his liquid, yellow eyes on katherine.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{i can't quite bring myself to say thank you.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{then this is done.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{not necessarily. maybe i like you. maybe i want you to come with me.}
<A>__{he rises to his feet and steps slowly toward her.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{you owe me, katherine. and you're going to ask me to take you home.}
<C>__{katherine}
<P>__{(clutching mary)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{you will. you will because any other way is going to be more awful than you can imagine.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{are you threatening me?}
<A>__{just a grinning, twisted stare.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{then you've picked the wrong person this time. i've just about had it up to here with ghosts. so you can put away the horror movie sneer and the k mart halloween eyes, because we know you now. we know you all. and if you want to force the issue then go ahead because you're just another angel to me. take a look at your buddy gabriel. then ask yourself, do you really, really want to fuck with us?}
<A>__{the smallest hint of a pause.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{perhaps another time.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{i'm holding my breath.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{goodbye, katherine. for now.}
<A>__{and he's gone. through the door and into the night.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{is he coming back?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{i don't think so, honey... i don't think so...}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{the fullness of day over old woman butte, hot and bright. chasing the night and its fears away under the punishing glare of noon. the village is full of police vehicles now. green broncos from the navaho tribal police. blue and white sheriff department sedans. the navaho cops are talking with katherine and mary. thomas is sitting on the trunk of a patrol car getting his wounds properly bandaged as the sheriff we met earlier leans beside him chewing on a wild oat stalk.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<P>__{(to deputy bandaging thomas)}
<D>__{is he going to live?}
<C>__{deputy}
<D>__{with any luck.}

<D>__{hmmm.}
<A>__{he chews some more on his stalk. looks off at the village.}

<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{gabriel what?}

<D>__{just gabriel.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{pretty violent guy, gabriel. even for out here.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{yeah.}

<D>__{what were you doing way up here?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{enemy ghost way for mary tsosie.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{indian stuff.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{yeah. indian stuff.}
<A>__{the sheriff looks over at katherine's pickup still jammed into the side of the kiva.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{did you kill this gabriel?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{maybe. i think so.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{don't have any idea where the body is i suppose.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{well, if he's alive he won't get far out there. us or the coyotes, it'll be the same.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i rang your office in la. they don't have a warrant out for a gabriel. or anybody else in arizona.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{i hadn't gotten around to it.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{sort of an out of pocket thing.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{the sheriff takes his hat off. runs his finger along the inside band.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{that woman lying at the bottom of the arroyo, the one still in her hospital gown, know anything about that?}

<D>__{no.}

<D>__{really.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{really.}

<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{you'll be going back to los angeles now?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{the sheriff pushes off from the patrol car and tosses aside the oak stalk.}

<D>__{don't hurry back.}

<C>__{deputy}
<D>__{don't do much but breathe the next few days. and get to a hospital. you're going to need some serious stitches.}

<D>__{thank you. i feel worse.}
<P>__{(to katherine re navaho cops)}
<D>__{they lean on you much?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{not really. i think they might have even understood. one of them's related to this clan. he'll give us a ride back if we want.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{good. i think i've about run out of hospitality with the sheriff's department.}
