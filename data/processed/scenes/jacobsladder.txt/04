<L>__{interior subway tracks night}
<A>__{jacob enters the rumbling passageway between the cars. the wheels spark against the rails. the dark tunnel walls flash by. he pulls the handle on the door to the next car. it is stuck. he struggles with it. a lady sitting alone inside turns to look at him. she seems threatened by his effort. he motions for her to help. she turns away. a look of disgust crosses jacob's face. he kicks the door. it slides open. the woman seems frightened as he approaches her.}

<P>__{(glad for a response)}
<D>__{yeah, you and everyone else.}
<A>__{jacob walks to the other end of the car and sits down. the only other passenger is an old man lying asleep on the fiberglass bench. occasionally his body shudders. it is the only sign of life in him. the train begins to slow down. jacob peers out of the window. nostrand avenue signs appear. he is relieved. he gets up and grabs hold of the overhead bar. the old man shudders and stretches out on the seat. as he adjusts his position, tugging at his coat, jacob catches a brief glimpse of something protruding from beneath the coat's hem. his eyes fixate on the spot, waiting for another look. there is a slight movement and it appears a long, red, fleshy protuberance. the sight of it sends shivers up jacob's spine. it looks strangely like a tail. only the stopping of the train breaks jacob's stare.}
