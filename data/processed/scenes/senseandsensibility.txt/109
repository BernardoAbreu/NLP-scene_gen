<A>__{fanny, john and robert are drinking chocolate together.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{apparently they never were engaged.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{miss grey has fifty thousand pounds. marianne is virtually penniless.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{she cannot have expected him to go through with it. but i feel for marianne she will lose her bloom and end a spinster like elinor. i think, my dear, we might consider having them to stay with us for a few days we are, after all, family, and my father.}
<A>__{he trails off. fanny exchanges an alarmed glance with robert. she thinks fast.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{my love, i would ask them with all my heart, but i have already asked miss steele for a visit and we cannot deprive mrs jennings of all her company at once. we can invite your sisters some other year, you know, and miss steele will profit far more from your generosity poor girl!}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{that is very thoughtful, fanny. we shall ask elinor and marianne next year, then... certainly!}
