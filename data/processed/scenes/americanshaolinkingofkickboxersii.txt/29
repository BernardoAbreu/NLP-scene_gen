<B>__{establishing shot of temple interior as drew opens the heavy door.}
<A>__{the muted half light inside is in direct contrast to the sunlight of the day outside. drew quietly closes the front door, and the half light takes over. he walks through the temple proper, and what follows is a montage of temple shots, establishing the feeling of the temple: the famous shaolin monk painting, the depressions in the floor of the training hall, the incense blackened walls of the temple, the temple figurines, the red lanterns hanging from the ceiling, a huge wooden carving of bodhidharma, etc. no one is around. drew continues to explore, looking for someone to talk to. he wanders into another hall, following the o.s. sounds of chanting. once inside this hall, he sees a group of monks, amid hanging incense burners and paper lanterns, sitting down on the floor chanting in rhythm. no one notices that drew is standing there. the monks eyes are open, but they don't seem to see him. he stands there for a moment, then shrugs and walks out of that hall. he goes into a corridor, then passes the "wooden man chamber". he sticks his head in, and sees all kinds of wooden statues lined up. he almost starts in, but is distracted by the sounds of training outside (o.s.). he walks out in search of the sounds.}
