<A>__{eve sits next to a roaring patio fireplace with a steaming cup of tea. allenby comes outside, joins her.}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{good god, eve you'll freeze out here.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i wanted some fresh air, robert. how is mr. gardiner?}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{a rather large contusion, but i don't feel there is any serious damage. i'd like to keep an eye on him, though i suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{stay here? is that necessary?}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{not necessary, but preferable. i don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{yes, he is different... not the kind of person one usually meets in washington.}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{how true. mr. gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{he's very intense, and internal, don't you think?}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{at times, yes. but that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. actually, i found him to have quite a sense of humor.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{good. it might be pleasant for a couple of days.}
<P>__{(eve puts down her tea)}
<D>__{... robert... is there any improvement...?}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{no, eve... i'm sorry.}
<A>__{eve is silent for a moment, looks out to the darkness.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{... sometimes when i see ben i could swear that he's getting stronger... something that he might say, the way he moves, or a look in his eyes makes me feel that this is all a nightmare and that he'll be better soon... it's just so hard to believe what's really happening...}
