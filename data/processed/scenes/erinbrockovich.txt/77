<C>__{erin}
<D>__{come here, you little motherfucker }
<A>__{the bug crawls up onto the table, zipping behind the salt, the pepper, the napkin holder. erin keeps after it, banging the table harder and harder with each smack of her shoe.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{hey, whoa relax }
<A>__{the salt and pepper skid off the table. the napkins fly from their holder. just as erin's about to nail the bug, it slips into a crack in the wall and disappears. erin hurls her shoe at the crack. it smashes into the wall.}
<D>__{eringod damn it!}
<A>__{as erin stands there staring at the wall, her breath starts to come heavily those deep breaths that precede tears. she slowly slides down into a chair, defeat overcoming her.}
<C>__{erin}
