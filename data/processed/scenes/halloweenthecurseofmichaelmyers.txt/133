<L>__{interior cellar (continuous)}
<A>__{john tentatively descends the stairs. barefoot. the flashlight beam preceding his every step. a rumbling below. the cellar is lit only by a shaft of moonlight cutting through the single dusty window. john probes around, shining the flashlight over cobwebs, boxes the puddle of water at his feet. now flooding the entire floor. john sloshes through the water toward the washing machine which is running at full tact.}

<A>__{he opens the washer lid and lifts out a water logged sheet. it drips red onto the white appliance blood. john backs away, loses his footing, and slips in the water landing right at the shape's feet. john screams as the shape grabs him by the neck, lifts him off the floor with one hand, then carries him across the basement and slams him brutally against the open fuse box. the shape's free hand lifts an enormous butcher knife. a loud whap as it's driven to the hilt into john's chest, through the fuse box. sparks wain from the wall. electricity courses through john's writing body.}
