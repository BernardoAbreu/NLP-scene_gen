<A>__{over the house is still the great big full moon. the front door opens and out comes the old man with the five dogs. the old man is in a greatcoat and a felt hat, and he's smoking a cigar. he stops on the top step and lets go a huge plume of cigar smoke. then he starts off with the dogs down the street.}
