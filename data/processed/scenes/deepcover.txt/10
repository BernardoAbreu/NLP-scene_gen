<L>__{interior same another interview}
<A>__{joe stevens watches carver reading his file and waiting for an answer. when none is forthcoming, carver glances up, finds stevens looking right back at him.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{the nigger's the one who falls for your bullshit.}
<A>__{he says it pleasantly, without belligerence. carver smiles: he's found his man. he offers his hand.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{gerald carver, united states district attorney. call me gerry.}
<L>__{interior a darkened room day night}
<A>__{on a tv screen: a grainy black and white tape, date and time stamped at the bottom. a grungy street, palm trees. the light from the monitor dimly illuminates carver and stevens. on screen the camera finds: a man in jeans, sneakers and sweatshirt on a street corner.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{he ought to be wearing a sign.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{you can tell he's a cop?}
<A>__{stevens laughs: it's obvious. a real drug dealer joins the cop. undercover cop: "you got it?" dealer: "in the motel, right over here..." the cop's uneasy, keeps glancing back toward the camera as they go.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{he keeps looking for his back up. now, the other guy knows it, too.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{then why's he taking him to the room?}
<C>__{stevens}
<P>__{(why else?)}
<D>__{to rip him off.}
<A>__{carver studies stevens in the darkness, impressed. on screen: the figures disappear into the motel. we hear their voices. dealer: "here, try some of it." undercover cop: "uhh... no, i don't..." dealer: "why not, you sonofabitch?" two bursts of sound distortion. a plainclothes cop, taft, (black, stocky, powerful) bolts from behind the camera, sprints toward the motel. the camera wobbles after him.}
<C>__{stevens}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{too late.}
<A>__{on screen: the camera (jerky, hand held) nears the open motel door. taft is bent over the undercover cop's body.}
<C>__{taft}
<D>__{oh, bobby... jesus, jesus...}
<P>__{(to the camera)}
<D>__{get an ambulance and back up. now!}
<A>__{he slams the wall, starts past the camera. carver pushes the pause button; the tape freezes on a jerky image of taft's face.}
<C>__{stevens}
<P>__{(focussed on taft)}
<D>__{who is he?}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{charles taft. lapd narcotics.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{he's a good cop.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{he's a great cop. two [names citation] and a [another citation]. as tough as they come and twice as honest.}
<A>__{carver watches stevens watch taft, smiles at something.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{but the cops aren't getting it done here, are they? gotta try something new...}
<A>__{he opens a manila envelope, dumps the contents on the desk: driver's license, social security card, high school transcript, prison records... all in the name of william g. hull. no photos.}
<C>__{stevens}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{who's john hull?}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{you are. if you want to be.}
<P>__{(off stevens)}
<D>__{most undercover guys don't know what they're doing because it's a day gig.}
<P>__{(indicates dead cop on tv)}
<D>__{i need somebody who goes under and stays there; six months, a year, five years...}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{what does he have to do?}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{buy drugs. sell drugs. feed me information.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{he's a snitch.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{he's a drug dealer. a criminal. a scumbag. but for the right side.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i want you to come to los angeles on loan to the justice department as a federal agent. your experience there will be credited toward your seniority here. and you'll come back to cleveland a p3 or higher.}
<C>__{stevens}
<P>__{(uncomfortable)}
<D>__{i can't do that. i've got a wife and kids.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{you're separated from your wife, she's filled for divorce. you see your kids every other weekend.}
<A>__{stevens takes a breath: this is awkward to explain.}
<C>__{stevens}
<P>__{(almost a confession)}
<D>__{all my life i've stayed away from that stuff. i've never touched drugs.}
<C>__{carver}
<P>__{(tolerant)}
<D>__{come on, a little grass...?}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{not grass. not nothing. i never even had a drink.}
<P>__{(his motto)}
<D>__{never have, never will. you don't understand. i made a choice in my life.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{what's to understand? you saw your father killed when you were ten, and you decided you wouldn't be like that.}
<P>__{(off stevens' surprise, carver grins)}
<D>__{i'm god, i know everything. you wanted to be a good boy, so you became a cop. hiding out in uniform... that's why you got the hard on for taft.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{it's not that simple.}
<C>__{carver}
<P>__{(opening joe's file; as if reluctantly)}
<D>__{i will tell the truth, joe. you're never going to be a taft.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{i don't believe that.}
<A>__{but he does.}
<C>__{carver}
<P>__{(looks at mmpi results)}
<D>__{you ever take a look at your psychological profile? you score almost like a criminal.}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"resents authority..."}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{i do not.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{"...exaggerated moral standards, but with no underlying value system." look at the anger, the repressed violence, it's almost off the scale...}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{let me see that...}
<A>__{carver hands him the scores which are, of course, just clusters of numbers. stevens is upset, though oddly unsurprised, as if this only confirmed his secret fears.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{why'd you join the force?}
<C>__{stevens}
<P>__{(awkward, but felt)}
<D>__{i wanted to be of use.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{well, now you can be. you won't be taft, but maybe you'll be something more... interesting.}
<P>__{(sits back)}
<D>__{there's a man named ramon gallegos who supplies 60% of the cocaine to the west coast. he's smart, smooth, and sufficiently elusive that we don't even have an adult photograph of him. however, his uncle is hector guzman, an important latin american political figure. gallegos uses uncle's connections to get product into the country, and everyone we've sent after him has ended up like that...}
<A>__{indicates dead body on tv.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{why would i be different?}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{you already are, that's the pointerior..}
<P>__{(indicates file, test scores)}
<D>__{you've got the ability and the personality to go underground and blend in completely. that's what the others couldn't. some part of them showed. that's why they're dead. see, there's only one rule in this game.}
<A>__{stevens raises his eyebrows: what?}
<C>__{carver}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{don't blow your cover.}
