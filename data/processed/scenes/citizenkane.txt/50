<L>__{interior parlor mrs. kane's boardinghouse day }
<A>__{camera is angling through the window, but the window frame is not cut into scene. we see only the field of snow again, same angle as in previous scene. charles is manufacturing another snowball. now camera pulls back, the frame of the window appearing, and we are inside the parlor of the boardinghouse. mrs. kane, aged about 28, is looking out towards her son. just as we take her in she speaks:}
<C>__{mrs. kane}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{be careful, charles!}
<C>__{thatcher's voice}
<D>__{mrs. kane }
<C>__{mrs. kane}
<P>__{(calling out the}
<D>__{window almost on}
<P>__{top of this)}
<D>__{pull your muffler around your neck, charles }
<A>__{but charles, deliriously happy in the snow, is oblivious to this and is running away. mrs. kane turns into camera and we see her face a strong face, worn and kind.}
<C>__{thatcher's voice}
<D>__{think we'll have to tell him now }
<A>__{camera now pulls back further, showing thatcher standing before a table on which is his stove pipe hat and an imposing multiplicity of official looking documents. he is 26 and, as might be expected, a very stuffy young man, already very expensive and conservative looking, even in colorado.}
<C>__{mrs. kane}
<D>__{i will sign those papers }
<C>__{kane sr.}
<D>__{you people seem to forget that i'm the boy's father.}
<A>__{at the sound of kane sr.'s voice, both have turned to him and the camera pulls back still further, taking him in. kane sr., who is the assistant curator in a livery stable, has been groomed as elegantly as is likely for this meeting ever since daybreak. from outside the window can be heard faintly the wild and cheerful cries of the boy, blissfully cavorting in the snow.}
<C>__{mrs. kane}
<D>__{it's going to be done exactly the way i've told mr. thatcher }
<C>__{kane sr.}
<D>__{if i want to, i can go to court. father has a right to }
<C>__{thatcher}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{mr. kane, the certificates that mr. graves left here are made out to mrs. kane, in her name. hers to do with as she pleases }
<C>__{kane sr.}
<D>__{well, i don't hold with signing my boy away to any bank as guardian just because }
<C>__{mrs. kane}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i want you to stop all this nonsense, jim.}
<C>__{thatcher}
<D>__{the bank's decision in all matters concerning his education, his place of residence and similar subjects will be final.}
<P>__{(clears his throat)}
<C>__{kane sr.}
<D>__{the idea of a bank being the guardian }
<A>__{mrs. kane has met his eye. her triumph over him finds expression in his failure to finish his sentence.}
<C>__{mrs. kane}
<P>__{(even more quietly)}
<D>__{i want you to stop all this nonsense, jim.}
<C>__{thatcher}
<D>__{we will assume full management of the colorado lode of which you, mrs. kane, are the sole owner.}
<A>__{kane sr. opens his mouth once or twice, as if to say something, but chokes down his opinion.}
<C>__{mrs. kane}
<P>__{(has been reading}
<D>__{past thatcher's shoulder as he}
<P>__{talked)}
<D>__{where do i sign, mr. thatcher?}
<C>__{thatcher}
<D>__{right here, mrs. kane.}
<C>__{kane sr.}
<P>__{(sulkily)}
<D>__{don't say i didn't warn you.}
<A>__{mrs. kane lifts the quill pen.}
<C>__{kane sr.}
<D>__{mary, i'm asking you for the last time anyon'd think i hadn't been a good husband and a }
<A>__{mrs. kane looks at him slowly. he stops his speech.}
<C>__{thatcher}
<D>__{the sum of fifty thousand dollars a year is to be paid to yourself and mr. kane as long as you both live, and thereafter the survivor }
<A>__{mrs. kane puts pen to the paper and signs.}
<C>__{kane sr.}
<D>__{well, let's hope it's all for the best.}
<C>__{mrs. kane}
<D>__{it is. go on, mr. thatcher }
<A>__{mrs. kane, listening to thatcher, of course has had her other ear bent in the direction of the boy's voice. thatcher is aware both of the boy's voice, which is counter to his own, and of mrs. kane's divided attention. as he pauses, kane sr. genteelly walks over to close the window.}
