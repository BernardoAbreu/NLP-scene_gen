<D>__{the '57 meeting was about how we were going to divide up the whole country. this meeting is about how we're gonna survive. you got 'made' guys informing for the feds; bosses going to jail; everybody's dealing drugs; people are getting whacked without permission. and on top of everything, now we got the chinese triads and these crazy russians to deal with. everything's changing. we need a leader. someone with fresh ideas. someone like you. it's gonna be a new century, paul. we gotta change with the times.}

<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{wait a second. i'm just gonna grab a toothpick.}
<A>__{the instant he steps back inside, manetta and his bodyguard are struck by an incredible volley of gunfire, which blows out all the glass in the door and windows. vitti's bodyguard, jelly, grabs him and throws him behind the counter, shielding him with his body. outside, the shooting has stopped and curious bystanders are looking in the broken windows. vitti's eyes well up with tears.}
