<L>__{exterior the ring}
<A>__{they trade. nothing. foreman advances, ali backs to the ropes, tags foreman with a couple of harmless left jabs. now foreman opens up with heavy artillery. ali gets in a couple of shots, but for the center of the round he's pummeled by foreman. midway through... foreman accepts a left jab, and while ali's left arm is out with it, foreman hammers a right into the exposed lower midsection of ali and then follows it with six tremendous hooks to ali's abdomen. ali pushes him away. foreman comes in again. foreman gets him on the rope again, and a surprising right on the left side of ali's face.}
<B>__{ali}
<A>__{ties up foreman's left in the crook of his elbow, and they stagger, married, awkwardly, into the center of ring. the referee separates them. another angle: foreman charging and throwing heavy shots. ali takes some on his elbows, arms, biceps and shoulders. now we see ali lean back. way back. 45 degrees back... we start to hear the twang of the rope. we get it. ali is using the rope as a shock absorber. some foreman punches get through, but the rope twangs and foreman's hitting a trampoline with a hammer. between deflection and being ring wise, ali dilutes much of what george throws. then foreman drives three powerful hooks into ali's side. ali's body spasms but, as if inconsequential...}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{george! show me something.}
<A>__{ali insulting, taunting snaps jabs into george's face, talking through his mouthpiece...}

<D>__{where's your punch, man?!}
<P>__{bundini dundee (o.s.)}
<D>__{ali, get off the ropes! stick 'em! jab! off the ropes!}
<A>__{up closer: ali blocks a rage of foreman head shots with his fists, the abdominal shots within his elbows. each foreman punch is a haymaker.}
<B>__{foreman}
<A>__{suddenly switches. from the floor: foreman's uppercut comes from camera and slams right through ali's guard, right into his jaw. ali's hurt! he holds on.}
<P>__{dundee bundini (over)}
<D>__{off the ropes! dance, champ, dance!}
<A>__{ali's pushed back like a rag doll.}
<B>__{foreman}
<A>__{throws a right hand. it, too, slams through ali's guard. he's in trouble. ali's eyes flash. roll in his head. he sees neon. time slows...lights dim...}

<C>__{ali}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{open the door, richard...outta this room... put on your coat, man...get out...}
<A>__{the ring: foreman slams shots into ali's kidneys, his ribs. ali will piss blood for two months. but ali stays on the ropes. as time}

<C>__{ali }
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{think my fight's over...? that...}
<P>__{(to george)}
<D>__{...all you got? that the hardest you hit?}
<A>__{ali comes off the rope, and ali hits foreman with a terrific three shot combination, a right left right. wham wham wham. feints. hits foreman with a left right. wham wham!}
<C>__{ali }
<D>__{c'mon, chump!!!}
<A>__{the bell. it's an ali rally at the end. he throws foreman a look of contempt as he walks to his corner. ali's corner}
