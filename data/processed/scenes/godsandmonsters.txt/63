<A>__{whale comes forward as clay enters, offering a hand at the end of a spindly wrist.}

<D>__{how are you, mr. boone? so glad you are free for lunch.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{all right, i guess.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i assume you worked up an appetite with your labor.}
<A>__{a hesitant smile from clay. whale picks a stack of mail off the table, rifles through envelopes.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{forgive my rudeness. at my age, the post is the cream of the day.}
<A>__{he returns the stack to the table but holds on to a square envelope.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{do you mind?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<A>__{clay looks off while whale opens the envelope.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{hmmm? princess margaret?}
<A>__{he is examining a folded card. he rubs a thumb over the printed lettering.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{her majesty's loyal subjects in the motion picture industry... cordially invited...reception at the home of...mr. george cukor!}
<A>__{his lips smack open in disgust.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{that pushy little horning in on the queen's sister, then offering to share her with the whole damn raj? i live in this country to get away from this rubbish!}
<A>__{he tosses the invitation on the table.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{is this david's doing?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{this david's a friend?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{yes. an old, useless friend. you must excuse me, mr. boone. this is a world i finished with long ago. i pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment.}
<P>__{(a deep breath)}
<D>__{lunch should be ready. shall we?}
<A>__{he holds out an open hand so that clay can precede him into the dining room.}
