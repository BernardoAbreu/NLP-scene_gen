<D>__{after breakfast, we drove out to phoenix park, where numbers of the young gentry were known to mrs. o'reilly, to all of whom she presented me in such a complimentary way that, before half an hour, i had got to be considered as a gentleman of great expectations and large property.}

<D>__{i had little notion then that i had got amongst a set of impostors that captain o'reilly was only an adventurer, and his lady a person of no credit. the fact was, a young man could hardly have fallen into worse hands than those in which i now found myself.}
<A>__{an evening of gambling.}
<C>__{roderick }

<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{what could happen to a man but misfortune from associating with such company? and in a very, very short time i became their prey.}
<A>__{roderick loses two hundred guineas to captain o'reilly in a single hand. we see captain o'reilly cheat, but roderick does not. he pays him the 18 gold guineas, remaining from the sum his mother gave him.}
