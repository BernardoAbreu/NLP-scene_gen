<L>__{exterior wisconsin skies late afternoon}
<A>__{we are on the belly of shermin's helicopter looking at the tree tops rushing underneath.}
<L>__{interior helicopter late afternoon}
<A>__{shermin is standing back of lyman and bell who are seated in front of the square of television screens watching various shots of the wooded landscape flowing by under them. shermin scrubs his hands over his face then bends over to stretch his back.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{aghh... i'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.}
<C>__{lyman}
<D>__{i wouldn't worry about it... there might not be any little league tomorrow.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{major bell}
<D>__{i'm telling you they're probably friendly.}
<C>__{lyman}
<D>__{then why did they try and sneak in the back door? tell me that. why didn't they contact us first and say...}
<C>__{radar technician}
<P>__{(loud)}
<D>__{ufo coming out of the grass.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{lock in.}
<C>__{radar technician}
<D>__{got it.}
<A>__{lyman and the technicians tap out orders to their tracking units and the views of the forest on three of the television screens change to images from their microwave scanners, neutron back scatters and doppler radar. on a fourth screen the forward looking infrared module begins creating a picture of the ufo. the men relax as they recognize the configurations of a light sea plane.}
<C>__{lyman}
<D>__{this is crazy. what were we going to do if that had been the ship? we have two thirty calibre machine guns, three m16's and some handguns.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{give it a rest, lyman.}
<C>__{major bell}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{i've never once heard of anybody being hurt by an extraterrestrial...}
<A>__{shermin goes hand over hand along the overhead straps to the radio operator. he begins to flip through a stack of telex messages.}
<C>__{lyman}
<D>__{that's because the ones that were hurt, died. they couldn't talk to you.}
<C>__{shermin}
<P>__{(to technician, after a look at lyman)}
<D>__{any reports about monsters, people in halloween masks, anything like that?}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{no, but there sure were a lot of people who saw lights in the sky last night. reports are still coming in.}
<C>__{major bell}
<P>__{(under above)}
<D>__{i've heard of blood being drawn, sometimes they were taken for a ride in the ship, a lot of times they said they had sex... but nobody was ever hurt...}
<C>__{lyman}
<D>__{but you decided those weren't real. this one is.}
<A>__{there is a buzz and a red dot appears in the center of one of the screens.}
<C>__{lyman}
<P>__{(over his shoulder to shermin)}
<D>__{fox.}
<A>__{he taps a three digit code and fox comes into view.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{i've got something for you.}
<A>__{a photograph of a very thin slab of yellow plastic pops up on a second screen next to fox. above lines of glowing colored dots are symbols of a hydrogen atom, pulsars, a nude man and a woman and earth's position in our solar system.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{recognize this?}
<C>__{major bell}
<D>__{it's a copy of the plaque nasa sent into space on the pioneer probes.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.}
<C>__{major bell}
<D>__{they must have picked it up in space.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{then it's not an accident that they found us.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{we don't think that's necessarily bad. at least it's a point of contact.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{not necessarily bad! if they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{we'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{that's not going to happen, george, unless you get us the help you promised us.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{we've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{don't let them do it this way, george. it's too important. we can't find this thing alone.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{you have to. we're trying to contact the ship. if we do, i will let you know immediately. good luck.}
<A>__{the television screen is reduced to static. lyman shuts it off.}
<C>__{radar technician}
<D>__{you get the feeling we're expendable?}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{we always were.}
