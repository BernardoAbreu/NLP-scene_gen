<L>__{exterior house day}
<A>__{william is in the barn loft, shoveling corn down to feed the hogs, while he glimpses something coming. the boy's pov an ox cart is coming down the curving lane. its driver is campbell, with macclannough walking behind it. the farmers glance up at william, their faces grim... from his perch in the loft, william sees that the neighbors have brought: the bodies of his father and brother. the cart stops; campbell, with a bandage around his left hand where more of his fingers are now missing, studies the back of the ox, as if it could tell him how to break such news. the butt of the ox seems to tell him to be matter of fact.}
