<L>__{interior james's apartment night}
<A>__{`crash', the door flies open as james and the nurse stumble through, mid embrace, tearing at one another's clothes... the apartment is basic. cramped. messy. like that of a poor student. ashtrays filled with half smoked joints. empty beer cans. a toaster. a kettle. a stereo. a cage containing two budgerigars. a mattress on the floor. newspapers with headlines about the dockers strike, england's crumbling economy, rolls royce being bailed out by the government subtle reminders of britain in transition, leaving behind its strong, imperial past. james and the nurse stand against the wall, still half dressed, but already passionately making love...}
<P>__{james (v o)}
<D>__{i have a theory why women like racing drivers. it's not because they respect what we do...driving round and round in circles. mostly they think that's pathetic. and they're probably right..}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{it's our closeness to death.}
<A>__{james and the nurse continue noisily, tirelessly making love in the shower...}
<P>__{james (v o)}
<D>__{the closer you are to death, the more alive you feel...the more alive you are. and they can see that in you. feel that in you. the way you live. willing to risk everything. james (v o) (contid) with no thought for tomorrow...as if each day is your last. it's a wonderful way to live...and the only way to drive. the only way to get that tenth of a second on everyone else...}
<A>__{the lovemaking becomes more intense...}
<P>__{james (v o)}
<D>__{to dare to be one step bolder...one step faster...}
<A>__{james is covered in perspiration, out on the edge...}
<P>__{james (v o)}
<D>__{sure one step closer to death...}
<A>__{james and the nurse, both screaming as they approach orgasm...}
<P>__{james (v o)}
<D>__{but one step closer to victory, too...}
<A>__{james and the nurse both climax together...and collapse on the bed. exhausted.}
