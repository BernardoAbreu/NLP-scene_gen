<DIAL>__{THE MAIN COMPOUND OF U.S. OUTPOST #31}
<ACTION>__{The interior is a cramped and never ending maze of hallways, passageways and doors which connect the many rooms and compartments within the compound. Sturdy, but prefabricated materials have been used in its construction. There is a laboratory. An infirmary. A kitchen and mess hall. A communications room and sleeping quarters. Other cubicles are for storage and supplies. The most spacious area of the building, and the main center of activity, is the Rec Room. Of the many entrance ways to this room can be seen the small work chambers with their sophisticated computers and other scientific equipment. The below quarter houses the generator and still other compartments for storage. A long underground tunnel connects the main compound to the dog kennel.}

The smaller hovels are connected by wooden planked walkways and steadying ropes. Multicolored pennants stick put of the snow marking pathways and directions to outdoor experiments. A tractor and two helicopters sit idle, covered with mounds of continuously mounting snow. TWO MEN, NORRIS AND BENNINGS standing some thirty yards from the main building are in the process of letting up a large red balloon. Childs, a hefty black man, is twenty yards away tinkering with a snowmobile. Their beards are caked with ice. It is winter and it is harsh. The faint sound of the copter turns their attention.}

He reloads his gun and bellows in his Scandinavian tongue. Norris and Bennings have no idea what he is saying. The survivor waves his arms as if shooting them off, screaming as he does so; his face now caked with blood. The two men are bewildered. The dog jumps up, licking and pawing them, imploring for safety. Blam!! The visitor fires. The men jump back in disbelief.}

A bullet smacks into the dog's hip, sending it skidding and howling in pain. Childs, the black man by the snowmobile, takes cover, diving behind his machine. Bennings is hit. Norris pulls, drags him back toward the compound. The dog crawls along beside them. The intruder is relentless in his assail. He runs, screaming, firing, screaming, reloading and firing.}

They pull feverishly along the ground trying to make it to the compound. The screeching closes in behind them. MacReady loses his grip on the rope and is blown toward the main building.

Another leg slaps Nauls to the ground. MacReady dodges still another appendage, dives on the generators and throws the switch. The current rips through the door. Garry dies instantly.

He clenches a stick of dynamite between his teeth, like a buccaneer's cutlass. Two large, compressed air tanks have been tied together at the top and are draped around his neck.
