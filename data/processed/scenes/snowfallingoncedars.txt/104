<L>__{interior kabuo's cell night}
<A>__{kabuo sits on the cot, the way we have always seen him. alone in his mind. footfalls. kabuo oblivious, far away. the door clangs open.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{you have a visitor, son.}
<A>__{turns to the visitor...}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{you said three minutes.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{won't take two.}
<A>__{and moran leaves. the door clangs shut. they are alone. only one man smiling...}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{please, sit down...}
<A>__{but the tall man doesn't. doesn't move.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{she told me you're writing a column. we're very grateful.}
<A>__{ishmael nods, awkwardly. acknowledging this.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{she. said you two go way back...}
<A>__{ishmael stares into kabuo's earnest smile.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{that's nice.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{you said there was a lantern in his hand. when you found him in the fog.}
<A>__{kabuo blinks. the man's tone is formal. as if the offer of friendliness is somehow rejected.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{and another one. lashed to the mast?}
<A>__{kabuo's own smile has faded. the mask has returned.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{two. lanterns.}
<A>__{and kabuo grins. in spite of himself.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{if i did the math right.}
<A>__{ishmael leans back. against the door.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{it's the sheriff's math. i'm wondering about.}
