<A>__{he stoops by her, picks her up and hugs her limp body close... as he does this, vietnam tom approaches from behind him. chris turns to face him but says nothing, still holding sam. the wind picks up and blows in gusts around them... tom looks down at the two of them for a moment, then reaches down and picks up his bunny mask. the evil grin is red with sam's blood, and one of the teeth is missing... the last of the fireworks display occurs, leaving the night full of smoke, hellish clouds and an increasing number of bright tailed meteors the apocalypse. amongst the churning clouds, a tornado like portal cuts through the sky and touches down somewhere in the town. it's swirling and vast, stretching down from limitless space...}
