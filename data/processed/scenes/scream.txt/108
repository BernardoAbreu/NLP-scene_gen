<D>__{sid, you found me out...i'm a virgin. and pretty happy about it right now.}
<A>__{sidney nudges their bodies. they both stir.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{careful. this is the moment when you think the killer's dead, but then he springs back to life for one last scare.}
<A>__{sidney grabs the gun from gale.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{not this time.}
<A>__{she positions her foot on stu's chest and aims.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{this is for my mom, asshole.}
<A>__{she shoots him in the forehead, a clean and perfect shot. the she aims the barrel at billy who's eyes suddenly open, blinking up at her, blood bubbling from his lips. he's not yet dead. their eyes lock.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{and this billy stud bucket is for having an incredibly small weenie.}
<A>__{she fires another perfect shot. they're both goners. sidney drops the smoking gun, standing silent over the bodies. a quiet moment when suddenly...}
<B>__{a figure lunges at them}
<A>__{both sid and gale and randy scream in epic, final scare proportions as mr. prescott leaps forward, still bound and gagged. sid catches her breath, relaxing.}

<A>__{sidney looks at him, dumbfounded.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{maybe catch a movie?}
<A>__{a long moment as sidney's face goes from disbelief to resignation to the slight trace of a smile.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{only if it's a nice meg ryan movie.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{you got it.}
<A>__{he smiles at her...watching as sidney grabs hold of her father, holding him tight as gale weathers, with camera in hand, gets one hell of an ending to this scary movie.}
<C>__{the end}
