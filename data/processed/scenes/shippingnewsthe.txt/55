<L>__{exterior hillside day}
<A>__{billowy clouds frame a languid kite, silver and sleek, darting this way and that. graceful, in command of the currents.}
<C>__{wavey }
<D>__{herry prowse! look how well your kite is doing!}
<A>__{see her now, seated atop a grassy slope. it is she who holds the string, and her boy is way down at the bottom of the hill with bunny. blue jumper billowing, the girl is teaching him how to make necklaces from wildflowers and garbage bag twisty ties. herry and the naked barbies watch with great attention. the learning will come later.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{are you making it dance with your thoughts?}
<A>__{on this he looks up. serious.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{keep thinking your thoughts! your kite is doing so much better than mr. quoyle's!}
<A>__{pull back slightly to reveal that quoyle has been sitting right beside her all along. he holds the string of a big, glum kite that hangs motionless in space with barely a flutter. as she watches the kids, he stares at her, fixedly deciding whether to ask...}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{do you think bunny's. strange?}
<A>__{wavey looks over. sees that he's worried half to death.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{in new york. they said she had a... personality disorder.}
<C>__{wavey }
<D>__{and it was named petal.}
<A>__{do you understand that?}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{all these hallucin...}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{the white dog. sometimes with the skinny ghost. kids do things like that, it's called imagination. like the necklaces.}
<A>__{the necklaces, yeh. a thought that frightens him.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{you know how many she makes?}
<A>__{she does.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{it's a skill, she's proud of it. and she brings her dolls along. and she looks good in blue. and she wears a key for a good luck charm.}
<A>__{her kind smile. no big deal.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{and she's saving her mother a room. did she tell you that?}
<A>__{wavey's slow nod.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{she talks to her at night. i can hear through the door.}
<A>__{very quiet now. the wind. the kites.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{you know how kids think. you have all those books.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{the ones i read to teach herry. they don't make me an exp...}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{just. is she okay?}
<A>__{that was naked. he swallows.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{i mean. if you had to guess..}
<A>__{too serious a subject. too good a woman. for an easy lie.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{that child is the only friend my son ever had. so she's strange, you bet.}
<A>__{she swallows, too. her eyes are damp.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{i love that little girl. and i will see to it. that she's all right.}
<A>__{hold the look.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{and i don't have to guess about it.}
