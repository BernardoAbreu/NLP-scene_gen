<A>__{over black comes the sound of deep heaving breaths. moist flesh flapping accompaniment. someone is beating off. a pause as the someone turns the page of a magazine. the beating off resumes at a quickened pace. the squeaking of bed springs joins in. another page is turned. feverish thumping until a male voice lets out a quiet moan. the breathing gradually slows to normal and lets out a relieved sigh of finality.}

<D>__{my name... is nick.}

<C>__{nick }
<D>__{the next thing you should know about me is that i am obsessed with sex.}
<A>__{a view of the drawer reveals it to be filled with neatly filed issues of penthouse and hustler. he puts the most recently utilized magazine in its place.}

<A>__{we pan down, and where nick's crotch is supposed to be, there is a hole in the screen leading us to...}
<B>__{las vegas of the body}
<A>__{the pulsing neon sign outside the club reads: nick's penis. we fly inside where we find a star studded floor show. drunken conventioneers make out with strippers. a leopard leaps through a burning hoop on stage.}

<D>__{he'd like to own a more prestigious model of bmw, but, as he often reminds me, he is burdened with crippling child support payments.}
<A>__{nick glances up and spots lacey, 20, coming up the drive toward him in a weensy bikini. her body has more outcroppings than the coastline of albania. she continues past him and embraces george.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{lacey is dad's latest bimbette. she is twenty and a recently minted alumna of stanfort.}
<A>__{super: (stanfort institute of cosmetology) george and lacey exchange saliva shamelessly. nick turns his attention back to the beamer. as the making out becomes heated groping, george's grip on the hose slackens. nick gets blindsided by the jet of water.}

<A>__{we're back with nick as he types on his computer. he looks down at the tent in his boxers.}
<T>__{cut to:}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{except his was black and yours is white. and dirty.}

<C>__{estelle}
<D>__{jerry, i don't understand. what happened to the chevy nova?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{sold it to a sailor on the alameda naval air base. a man should never own a car for more than three months, estelle. that way he always gets the thrill of owning a new automobile!}
<A>__{jerry smiles with cretin pride. nick looks to his mother and disturbingly enough, she seems turned on by his car owner savvy.}

<C>__{nick }
<D>__{i'm starting to think her boyfriends are like u.s. presidents.}
<A>__{as jerry pulls out, he tosses his beer bottle in the direction of the trash can at the end of the drive.}

<A>__{from the living room comes the sound of an orgy and the jingle jangle of a belt buckle. then the ding dong of the front doorbell. the jingle jangle pauses and when the doorbell rings a second time, the orgy gets muted. nick enters the kitchen pulling up his trousers. i e. estelle's home moments later the door is opened to reveal two burly, tattooed sailors standing on the stoop. their eyes drift to nick's mid section. nick follows their eyes to the belt buckle he neglected to fasten out of haste. he returns his gaze to the sailors as he wrangles the belt.}
<D>__{sailor #1 is jerry here?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{he just left. what's up? sailor #1 what's up is that hunk of shit chevy he sold us made it seventeen miles before the engine blew up. sailor #2 and we found evidence of a banana in the transmission.}
<A>__{the second sailor holds aloft the banana peel sealed in a plastic bag. nick glances to drive and regards the smoking chevy nova with its camouflage paint job. a third sailor is rummaging through the boxes in the open garage. he finds some spray paint and shakes the can. nick turns back to the sailors on the stoop.}
<D>__{sailor #1 so he owes us nine hundred dollars.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{well, i think he used that nine hundred dollars to buy his lincoln. he's giving my mom a joyride in it now. but he'll be back this afternoon, so i would come back then. he's pretty stubborn. you might have to beat it out of him. sailor #1 that can be arranged. in the meantime we're leaving the piece of shit in the driveway. with a note.}
<A>__{nick looks one more time to the chevy as the third sailor finishes painting the hood with the words: pay up or die.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i like it. very to the pointerior well... see you guys this afternoon!}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i dunno, lefty. i think your sister is just waging psychological warfare.}
<C>__{lefty}
<D>__{well it's working. what am i gonna do, nick? i'm obsessed. i think about millie so much my balls ache.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{maybe your just not wacking off enough.}
<A>__{as if in response, lefty passes the binoculars off to nick and then turns over onto his back and unzips his pants. as lefty jerks it, nick looks with nonchalance...}

<D>__{in case you haven't heard, lefty's erect member takes a dramatic turn midway up the shaft.}
<C>__{lefty }
<D>__{then i look at this issue of better homes and gardens that has a girl that looks just like millie until it gets good and hard. i think it's starting to straighten out.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{why don't you just have your parents take you to the dick doctor?}
<C>__{lefty }
<D>__{are you kidding? it would kill them to know that i even get hard ons.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{still, you might want to get it fixed before asking millie out.}
<C>__{lefty }
<D>__{true. what if i shove it up the wrong hole?}
<A>__{nick gives a dubious glance in lefty's direction.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{lefty's grasp of the female anatomy is somewhat tenuous; he imagines there are orifices galore down there.}

<D>__{nick, you little shit, get down here!}
<A>__{jerry hollers from the kitchen where estelle gapes out the window. nick calmly joins them from upstairs.}

<D>__{nick, do you know anything about this?}
<A>__{she points out the window and they all take in the chevy and the sailors' oh so subtle note on the hood.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{oh, yeah. those sailors came by. they want their money back. i guess there was a banana in the transmission.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{you tell them when i was coming back?}

<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i think i will go get the lincoln washed.}
<C>__{estelle}
<D>__{you're leaving? what happens when the sailor comes back for his nine hundred dollars?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{just tell him he bought the car with my standard guarantee. thirty days or thirty feet. whichever comes first. i'm in the right.}
<A>__{and on cue comes the ring of the doorbell and the simultaneous pounding of angry navy fists on the back door. they peer out the window and find the fleet on the front steps.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{oh, look. the sailors are here.}
<A>__{jerry first starts to dart one way and then another, searching for a hiding space as he hisses.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{get rid of them!}
<A>__{and then the front door gets kicked open and a mob of sailors pour in. jerry flees. a handheld cam chase as he heads for the back and is cut off by the sailors coming in. jerry bolts up the stairs.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{jerry, where are you going? just tell them you are in the right.}
<L>__{interior estelle's home continuous}
<A>__{they manage to grab jerry by the legs and haul him down the stairs. jerry loses his grasp step by step, crying with a sound not unlike e.t. when the flashlight hit him in the cornfield. the two big guys with bad haircuts hold jerry off the ground while the earnstwhile chevy owner goes through his pockets.}
<D>__{sailor #1 sixty three lousy dollars.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{that's my life savings!}
<A>__{one of the sailors pokes jerry in the gut hard and he whimpers.}
<C>__{estelle}
<D>__{don't hurt him! nick, call 911! sailor #1 touch that phone, kid, and you lose your left nut.}
<A>__{nick raises his hands. "you don't have to tell me twice."}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{please. please don't hurt me. it's all i got, guys. i swear. take the lincoln! sailor #1 i don't want the lincoln. i want my nine hundred dollars. i'm taking the sixty three, which means you owe me another eight hundred and thirty.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{eight hundred and thirty seven, actually. sailor #1 exactly. have it by tomorrow or you'll be found in the trunk of your new used piece of shit at the bottom of the bay.}
<A>__{and with that they release him and jerry crumples to the floor like an abandoned marionette.}
<L>__{interior estelle's kitchen moments later}
<A>__{the three of them watch the fleet pile into a navy van that reads for official use only. the moment they pull out, jerry dusts himself off and puts on a pretense of being unfazed.}

<D>__{wow, those guys are even dumber than i thought. they actually think i'm stupid enough to let them muscle me into paying.}
<C>__{estelle}
<D>__{jerry, what are you talking about? we need to call the police!}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i'm not some tattle tale like your son.}
<A>__{nick rolls his eyes.}

<D>__{then for god's sake, jerry, just sell the lincoln and pay them!}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{can't. it's in the code.}

<D>__{code of the streets, babe. code of the streets.}

<D>__{i'm not sure how this is the solution to his problem. but i've decided to go along with it, seeing as i'm not rooting for him anyway.}

<D>__{jerry...? you said it was a cabin.}
<A>__{in the back, nick removes his sunglasses to regard the long, green, turd of a trailer. some concrete dwarves in the grass. a dusty canvas awning over a small cement patio. a decrepit picket fence with a sign that reads: my green haven. estelle looks as if she's about to cry. jerry puts his arm around her.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{c'mon estelle. it's real cute on the inside.}
<L>__{interior my green haven night}
<A>__{substitute cluttered for cute. the three of them are crammed around a dining surface as accommodating as an airplane tray table. 3 d religious art hangs on the wall above them.}

<A>__{jerry pushes out and disappears into the back. nick watches him with loathing. estelle smiles apologetically.}

<A>__{her smile fades.}
<C>__{estelle}
<D>__{nick, how many men do you think there are who'd be interested in a forty one year old woman with two brats, no money, and stretch marks?}
<A>__{and with that she excuses herself, leaving nick to ponder.}

<L>__{exterior woods day}
<A>__{the serene melodies of rousing hymns float from the well attended congregation in the meeting hall. we track across the trees as nick makes his way down the path. he slows to observe the sun coming through the canopy overhead. he glances off the path and comes to a sudden stop. a grape arbor flanked by corinthian columns set against the blue of clear lake. a chestnut haired sheeni saunders stands facing the water, her head tilted down to read the book in her hands. the wind coming off the lake blows her dress just enough to give a hint of the shapely thighs underneath. light falls in shafts through the latticework of the arbor like something out of a francois boucher painting.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{the moment i see her i know the gods, while having cruelly endowed me with imperfect posture and pussy postponing pimples, had put me here for a purpose. my heart palpitates. my mind races. i get an instant t.e.}

<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{pardon me, everyone.}
<A>__{sheeni steps into the tiny closet to change. vijay and nick regard the... wall of taggarty's conquests a series of mug shots of sullen looking teenage boys. most of them have been given a grade of c or below.}

<D>__{i assume he went back to the boys' dorm. now really, nickie, you are keeping everyone awake with your inquiries.}
<A>__{though silence follows, we take a moment to allow nick's mind to race in the dark. he stands and looks at the mirror above the dresser. francois can be made out sitting by the window in the moonlight, stroking the thompson.}
<C>__{francois}
<D>__{now is our chance.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{chance for what?}
<C>__{francois}
<D>__{to confront our nemesis. we must go to the boys' dorm and kill trent where he sleeps.}

<C>__{ed}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{nothing. it's just that sheeni mentioned trent has a thing for a guy named ed, and that he touches the guy when he falls asleep. but obviously if that were you, you'd know about it. must be a different ed solomon. take care now.}
<A>__{nick takes off running and ed stares after him.}
<L>__{exterior ecole des arts et litterature grounds night}
<A>__{the security van continues to make its rounds. we find nick crouching behind the steps to the boys dorm. he pulls the hood of his windbreaker over his head and takes a deep breath. as the searchlight passes by, he makes a break for it. track with nick as he darts from one form of cover to the next, perhaps accompanied by the imagined sounds of mortar blasts and machine gun turret fire. at long last he reaches the girls' dorm undetected.}
<L>__{interior girls' dorm hallway night}
<A>__{nick bangs on the door. heather answers in little more than a g string and nick seems to forget his mission just long enough to appreciate her body.}

<C>__{lefty}
<D>__{you can have one of ours, nick. if you need one.}

<C>__{heather}
<D>__{he didn't say, but i'm pretty sure i just saw him go into our bathroom down the hall.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{thanks. oh, and i'd be careful with those condoms. trent's roommate ed said that trent pokes holes in them so that he can get sheeni pregnant and be with her forever.}

<L>__{interior girl's bathroom night}
<A>__{there is the clap of thunder outside as nick throws open the door to the girls' bathroom. he looks around with murderous rage. there comes the sound of someone vomiting. nick kicks in the stall and finds bernice lynch, 17, a thin platinum haired girl with six earrings per lobe. she hurls into the toilet again and turns around to find nick.}

<D>__{q'est que c'est passer ici?!?}
<A>__{nick bolts upright, smacking his head against the top bunk. he lands on the floor, where he gets a view of... trent standing behind the matron. the blinding light makes his features difficult to make out but his white teeth are definitely smiling diabolically.}

<A>__{nick and the other two boys pause in the doorway. where once the chevy occupied the space, the living room was now fairly returned to it's normal uncluttered state with all the furniture placed back in the original positions. at some point wally must have sawed a hole in the wall shared by the living and dining areas because the chevy now occupies that hole and has been painted and decorated such that it has achieved an almost seamless blend with the wall. estelle goes and takes a seat on the couch.}
