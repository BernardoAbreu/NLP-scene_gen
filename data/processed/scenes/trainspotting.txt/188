<D>__{so why did i do it? i could offer a million answers, all false. the truth is that i'm a bad person, but that's going to change, i'm going to change. this is the last of this sort of thing. i'm cleaning up and i'm moving on, going straight and choosing life. i'm looking forward to it already. i'm going to be just like you: the job, the family, the fucking big television, the washing machine, the car, the compact disc and electrical tin opener, good health, low cholesterol, dental insurance, mortgage, starter home, leisurewear, luggage, three piece suite, diy, game shows, junk food, children, walks in the park, nine to five, good at golf, washing the car, choice of sweaters, family christmas, indexed pension, tax exemption, clearing the gutters, getting by, looking ahead, to the day you die.}
