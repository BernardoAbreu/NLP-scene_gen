<L>__{135: interior kitchen living room. berlin's house. day.}
<A>__{back door opens and helena walks in. first thing she senses is cold. this place smells like it hasn't been lived in since she was last here. and last time she was here she was happy. dumps her case and heads for the living room. can't see it but feels the overwhelming gloom. finds a couch and now she sits to wait. the silence is almost total. but something disturbs it. helena looks around. back on her feet she tries to discover source of the sound. finally arrives at a table lamp. she feels the bulb and it's hot. a large moth beats itself crazy inside the shade. reaches in and turns it off & the house is in virtual darkness.}
