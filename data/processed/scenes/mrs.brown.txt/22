<L>__{exterior osborne house, the grounds day}
<A>__{the royal horse carrier rattles into the grounds and on down the driveway past the beautiful, manicured lawns stretching away towards the ornate twin towers of osborne house. a few outdoor servants watch its progress curiously.}
<L>__{interior osborne house, queen's dining room day}
<A>__{the silence continues as victoria finishes her plain pudding. immediately, servants appear at every place and whip away the pudding bowls whether their owners have finished or not. nobody thinks this odd; it is part of the routine. doctor jenner clears his throat.}
<C>__{jenner}
<D>__{we're expecting brown this afternoon, ma'am.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{whom?}
<A>__{a beat. victoria takes a sip of water, dabs her mouth with her napkin and rises. everyone else rises too. suddenly, the queen turns to bertie's nervous wife, princess alexandra, and proclaims abruptly:}
<C>__{victoria }
<D>__{that's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, alex. silk suits you well.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but you are not eating enough. one must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.}
<C>__{princess alexandra}
<D>__{yes, ma'am.}
<A>__{victoria nods earnestly. lost to the effect her words have had, she marches out again. behind her, she leaves princess alexandra feeling humiliated and crestfallen in front of all the others. bertie takes her hand and squeezes tight, trying awkwardly to console.}
