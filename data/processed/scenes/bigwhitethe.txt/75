<A>__{ted at his cubicle, thinking hard as he chews on some jerky as he works the phone. snow whips by outside the window.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(just waiting to cut in)}
<D>__{that's really super, simon. now how'd you like to run some names for me?}
<A>__{ted sees cam reflected in his dark computer screen. annoyed, he puts his hand over the receiver.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{you mind?}
<C>__{cam}
<D>__{now, now. let's not forget who's pulling double duty.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(hanging up)}
<D>__{simon, i will call you back.}
<P>__{(to cam: forced)}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{cam}
<D>__{much better. so?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{turns out our mr. barnell is mortgaged to the nuts. his business is about one step away from chapter 11. plus it's like his brother raymond never existed. he's got no credit history, no nothing for the last five years.}
<C>__{cam}
<D>__{ya know, not having a credit history isn't actually a crime. people around here have been known to swap a snow mobile for 500 pounds of venison. doesn't exactly leave a paper trail.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yes, but he was in florida, someplace. plus, the only thing he did after his recent "reappearance" was get some new id and a new credit card. didn't charge anything.}
<C>__{cam}
<D>__{wow. less than nothing.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{it's something.}
<C>__{cam}
<D>__{no it's not... in my humble, junior investigator's opinion.}
<A>__{the phone rings. ted picks up.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{watters, claims. yeah, hang on...}
<P>__{(to cam)}
<D>__{it's personal. i promise.}
<A>__{cam shrugs, walks off. ted waits 'til he's gone...}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{mr. barnell... your ears must have been burning, i was just sure, what time?}
<A>__{ted is scribbling down something on a pad of paper.}
