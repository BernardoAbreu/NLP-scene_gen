<L>__{interior bus early morning}
<A>__{song continues. almost everybody is asleep. william takes the camera and snaps a polaroid of a sleeping penny. she wakes up.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{give that to me.}
<A>__{she grabs for it, they have a brief play fight. he grabs some other polaroids from her pocket. he hustles to the back of the bus, pockets the photo, and settles down to watch the passing landscapes. she chases him down the aisle. music continues as she sits down next to him. out the window, a long distance running team of girls keeps pace with the bus for a bit. they wave. penny watches them over sunglasses, waves briefly to the real world.}

<P>__{(breathing heavy, owning the world)}
<D>__{when we go to morocco, i think we should wear completely different clothes, and be completely different people.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{what will our names be?}
<A>__{she snaps a polaroid of a nearby sleeping silent ed, pockets the polaroid. she regards russell up ahead, also sleeping. her attention has already wandered from morocco.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{what do you think of russell?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i like him.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{you're coming to cleveland, right? william cleveland, ohio?}

<D>__{get my interview with russell before greenville.}
<A>__{and you've got to help}
<D>__{me. okay? friends... remember?}
<A>__{penny is still watching russell.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{you should give him a break. there are real problems in the band. off the record.}
<A>__{gravely noting the word "problems", the kid joins penny in watching russell, who is splayed haphazardly, sleeping restlessly up ahead.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{what problems?}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{okay. i got it. i think your name should be spencer, and mine will be jane.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i can't keep up with you.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{no one can.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{what's your real name?}
<A>__{she looks at him briefly. she puts her arm around him. it's intoxicating, but he doesn't quite know how to act. with her free hand, she gestures with a hanger. as they regard russell sleeping nearby:}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{here's the thing about russell. he's my last project. i only do this for a very few people. and i think we should do it together he is almost great. we've got to take him there. you and me we can do it. deal? because the other guys are good but he could be great. he's my last project.}
<A>__{he looks at her. she imitates his face back to him.}
<C>__{penny }
<D>__{it's all happening.}
