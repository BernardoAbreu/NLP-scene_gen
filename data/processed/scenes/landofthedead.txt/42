<L>__{interior center ring "the arena" day}
<A>__{riley and charlie drift into a large room that's packed with bettors hooting and hollering like football fans. they're all jammed onto tiered wooden viewing stands arranged around an iron mesh structure that looks like a lion tamer's cage. gates open. the painted walkers are thrust inside the cage. their nooses are released. the gates are locked behind them.}
<B>__{d}
<A>__{ead red, alarmed by the color of dead black's face, reaches out and gently touches the painterior its fingers come away with blackened tips. lack follows suit, staining its fingers red. black licks its hand, spitting when it identifies not blood, but something distasteful. bookies drift among the spectators, taking bets with fists full of cash.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what are they betting on, riley?}
<B>__{s .}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{red or black. who's gonna win the fight.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what fight? stenches don't fight.}
<C>__{tout }
<D>__{they do when there's food.}
<A>__{the tout sidles over.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{what's on the menu today? cat or dog?}
<C>__{tout}
<D>__{i told you. today it's something new.}
<A>__{clang! another gate opens in the cage. a hush falls as everyone awaits what will come. including the dead men, who gaze with anticipation at the opening. what comes is... ..a woman! alive, badly bruised, her dress in tatters. despite tarnish, she still looks sexy. last night she was a hooker known as slack. now she's meat in a lion cage.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{jesus fucking christ.}
<A>__{the gate slams shut. the dead things walk toward the woman. riley rushes off. charlie follows.}
<B>__{s}
<A>__{lack backs up, hits the wall of the cage and, terrified, starts to circle its iron perimeter. the dead men flank her. black is the first to touch her. the crowd howls. lack's terror turns to determination. she punches black three times in the face. the thing recoils as she glides out of its grasp. riley and charlie reach the bruisers who took their weapons.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{give us our guns.}
<C>__{bruiser}
<P>__{(handing over the weapons) you}
<D>__{leavin'?}
<A>__{riley cocks his m 16.}
<B>__{t}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{in a little while.}
<A>__{in the ring, black reaches for slack again. with one lightning fast move, she kicks it in the chest, sending it flying into red's arms. red shoves black aside. black makes another try for the woman. red grabs its rival. this time black hangs on to red's shirt. the two twirl around in a staggering lampoon of a wrestling match. slack rushes to the side of the cage and starts to climb. she's agile. strong. but she almost falls as the cage shakes with the force of... ...red slamming black against the mesh. on their way back through the arena, riley and charley push through the crowd, trying to reach the center ring. a goon steps in front of them.}
<C>__{goon}
<D>__{no guns in here!}
<A>__{riley gives him a rifle butt in the face and moves on.}
<B>__{s}
<A>__{lack continues to climb the cage, almost out of reach, but black grabs one of her ankles, pulling her down and slamming her to the ground. black hunkers, drooling, over slack. as it is about to bite, rat a tat! a short burst from riley's m 16 shatters black's collarbone. cheekbone. skull. the thing drops. red lunges for slack. riley kills it with another short burst. he crowd panics, stampeding toward the exit. suddenly more bullets fly, this time from a glock, fired by... ...chihuahua, who, in a rage, is pushing through the legs of the fleeing crowd. he makes it to a clear spot and draws a steady bead on a target...charlie. chihuahua pulls his trigger. riley beats him by an instant, firing the m 16. just as chihuahua's gun goes off...a line of bullet holes perforates the little man's belly. the round from his glock misses charlie completely. riley runs to the cage, where slack stands, trembling, just on the other side of the bars.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{she nods gratefully. hihuahua is still on his feet. and now he is really pissed. not because of the holes in his gut, but because...}
<C>__{chihuahua}
<D>__{my suit! you fucked up my new suit!}
<A>__{riley turns to chihuahua, but doesn't have time to lift the m 16 before...blam! the little man fires at him. slack delivers a powerful kick into the flexible fencing, sending riley sprawling to the ground and saving him from... ...chihuahua's round, which misses riley...but hits slack! spun around by the impact, she falls face down. chihuahua continues to fire. riley marine crawls as bullets punch around him, sparking off the cage. chihuahua keeps coming, keeps firing, until... ...a single shot from charlie's .45 shatters his skull. he drops like a broken pinata. riley looks up, seeing two other men with guns. chihuahua's goons. for a moment it seems as if a major shooting match is going to break out. but before it does...}
<C>__{policeman }
<D>__{hold it!}
<B>__{.}
<A>__{..four policemen burst in. the goons lower their weapons. riley runs back to the cage, blasts the lock on the nearest gate, and rushes inside. slack's body is lying on the floor. he suspects she's dead. when her body moves, he suspects worse. he plants the barrel of his m 16 against her temple.}
<C>__{slack}
<D>__{i'm alright, i'm alright!}
<A>__{slack uses her left arm to push herself up to a sitting position. her right arm is bleeding, up near the shoulder.}
<C>__{slack }
<D>__{ucker got my right arm. i'm a lefty.}
<A>__{they look into each other's eyes.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{seen you around.}
<C>__{slack}
<D>__{seen you around.}
<C>__{y}
<C>__{i}
<A>__{a policeman steps over.}
<C>__{policeman}
<D>__{the hell happened here?}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{somebody shot the little fat man.}
<C>__{policeman}
<D>__{yeah, i see that. you're under arrest.}
