<A>__{precious lunges for a trash bin into which she promptly vomits. she quickly catches her breath. wipes her mouth and looks 10 feet away at a brightness coming from an open doorway. her heart beats loudly. precious stands up. she seems to be there for a considerable spell. a blur of a young girl darts into the room from the other end of the hall without looking at her. ms. rain, petite, african american, beautiful, thirties, alert eyes enters the hallway looking at her watch and then up to precious.}
