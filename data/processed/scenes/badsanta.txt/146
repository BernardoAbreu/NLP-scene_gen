<A>__{frozen in a semi circle at the foot of the neighboring lawn, an army of cops has guns trained on the felled santa claus, who is sprawled on the neighbor's stoop, motionless. his hand stretches toward the front door holding a fluffy pink elephant un delivered... the six year old draws in his breath and screams. he is joined by his equally adorable little brother and sister who look, and scream, with him. somewhere, a neighborhood dog barks. a cop looks up at the window and the three shrieking children.}
