<L>__{interior apartment bedroom day}
<A>__{wesley is in bed on top of joyce, humping her slowly.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{... and what kind of car does she drive?}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{well, she wanted a lesabre, but del made her use that blue corsica...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so, is this what you boys'd call 'pumping me for information?'}
<A>__{joyce giggles as wesley stops moving.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{did you say lesabre?}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{look, she didn't kill del over no car if that's what you're thinking.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{but she could have taken one, right?}
<A>__{with her knees, joyce prods him into humping her again.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{maybe, but i don't think she had the nerve. i know her. and i'm a pretty good judge of character...}
<A>__{joyce reaches for a cigarette on the nightstand and takes a deep drag. wesley closes his eyes and turns away, offended.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{... yeah, i can see that.}
