<C>__{jean}
<D>__{he's fucking one of his grad students. i don't care aside from the pathetic english and humanities cliche, like all those departmental dicks fucking their students he can fuck who he wants and that's who teachers meet, students. he was just a turd the way he didn't give mom a chance to respond or anything. what sucks now is she's on my ass cause she's afraid i will have some post divorce freak out and become some heroin addict or shoot everybody at school. or god forbid, lose my virginity. i don't know what it is about dad splitting that put mom on hymen patrol.}
