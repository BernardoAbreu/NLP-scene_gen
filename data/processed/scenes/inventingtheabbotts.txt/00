<A>__{(late spring, 1957) opening credits roll over a tent montage assorted angles of a group of men hard at work erecting a large striped "big top" style canvas tent, including: the long steel stakes being sledge hammered into the lawn, practiced hands rapidly rigging the lines, the tall center poles being leveraged upright, the heavy rolled up sections of canvas being maneuvered into position, and ending with the canvas being hoisted up the poles as the tent assumes its full and finished form. new angle tent on the front yard of the abbott mansion. the residence is on main street, four blocks from where the commercial district begins. the mature, over arching trees makes this street of prosperous houses a grand promenade.}
