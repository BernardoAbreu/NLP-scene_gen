<A>__{frank brushes past tables, hits the street and runs down the palazzo, toward cara.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{cara!}
<A>__{cara says nothing. she just shoots frank an angry glance and climbs onto a vaporetto (water taxi). frank runs to the edge of the water as it motors away. suddenly he feels the presence of somebody behind him. two of ackerman's men are right there. they pin his arms forcefully.}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{ok signor... you can come with us now.}
<A>__{frank looks at the two big men on either side of him. then at cara disappearing over the water. the fight drains out of him and he doesn't resist.}
