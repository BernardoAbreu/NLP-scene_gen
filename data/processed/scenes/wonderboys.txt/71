<A>__{james irish whiskey in one hand, the pride of humboldt county in the other watches with deep absorption as judy and mickey have a heartfelt conversation. then, sensing something ...he turns. hank and irene winters, grocery bags in arm, stand frozen.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{hullo.}
<A>__{footsteps are heard on the staircase and grady hobbies into view. he tries a smile.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{mom. dad.}
<L>__{interior den winters house (a bit later)}
<A>__{hank winters emerges from the bathroom with a roll of tape, a bottle of alcohol, and some cotton wool.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{well, it's infected, i can tell you that. i'm just going to clean it up a bit. it's up to you to find someone who knows what they're doing. here. put your foot up.}
<A>__{grady puts his foot up on hank's lazy boy, then notices a book lying face down on the seat. the author on the back cover looks as if he's trying very hard to look consequential. to his surprise, grady realizes the author is himself.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{so he's one of your students, this boy?}
<A>__{grady glances into the living room, where james and irene sit on a long couch together, sipping something hot. james is looking out the window, a curious expression on his face. grady looks out his own window, sees the newfoundland sniffing curiously at the galaxie's trunk. when he glances back into the living room, he and james make brief eye contact, then blink, look away.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{yes. he's a good kid. maybe a little messed up.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{well, i'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.}
<A>__{grady tries to read hank's face is he messing with him? but hank gives nothing away. grady nods to the book.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{what made you pull out that old thing?}
<C>__{hank}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{i was thinking of you.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{it's no arsonist's daughter, but i guess you know that. it's a young man's book. it got me remembering how it felt to be young.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{maybe i should read it.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{oh, i don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, grady.}
<A>__{grady doesn't have to read hank's face this time.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{where's emily, hank?}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{i 'don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, grady.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i'm not going to stalk her. hank. i just. ..want to know where i stand.}
<A>__{hank looks up, incredulous.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{where you stand?}
<C>__{grady}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{l just want to say i'm sorry.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{she's in philadelphia seeing linda aahby. the neurologist.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{neurologist? why? what's wrong?}
<C>__{hank}
<P>__{(frowning)}
<D>__{nothing's wrong. they went to wellesley together.}
<C>__{grady}
<P>__{(sheepishly)}
<D>__{oh. right. linda ...i haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. my editor's in town and i have the book to finish and }
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{ah, right. the book.}
<A>__{grady starts to continue, then stops, cowed by something in hank's tone, something dismissive. instead, he looks away, toward the living room, and catches sight of james again, sitting alone now with his big cup of cocoa.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{listen, hank, i'm sorry about ail this. i didn't come here to upset you and irene. i want you to know that.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{why did you come here, grady?}
<A>__{grady gestures vaguely.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i just wanted to see her, i guess emily. and to see you too you and irene. and to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this everything that's happening it's not forever. it doesn't mean "goodbye."}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{give me a break, grady.}
<A>__{hank snaps off the tape, slaps grady's ankle.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{you're done.}
