<A>__{one floor up, the man steps into the hallway and starts for the stairs, moving quickly and confidently. knows where he's going, knows what he wants. he starts down the stairs, happens to glance to the side as he does so. he freezes. he's looking in the open doorway of the top floor bathroom, staring hard at something that clearly disturbs him. a nightlight. plugged into an outlet in the baseboard in the bathroom. (for the record, it's the power puff girls.) the man climbs the stairs again, concerned, goes to the door of the bathroom. he looks from the nightlight to the countertop. there's a moving box on the countertop. his eyes widen. this is news to him, bad news. he takes a step back and a breath. he turns, looks to the end of the hall. his eyes now adjusted to the darkness, he notices something he didn't see before, something coming from under the door to the fourth floor bedroom. light. from inside. from another nightlight.}
