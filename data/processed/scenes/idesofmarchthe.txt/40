<D>__{in fairness, this has been tried before...operation chaos, as rush limbaugh called it, where republicans voted for a democrat they thought they could beat in the general election. we asked senator pullman's campaign manager if this sudden right wing support is welcome...}
<A>__{cut to a pre tape with duffy.}
<C>__{duffy }
<D>__{is it decisive?...of course not...look, we believe that the polls are within the margin of error and that the senator will win ohio...with ohio democrats...i can't really see republicans showing up to vote for our candidate...having said that, we'll take all the support we can get.}

<C>__{jack stearns}
<D>__{i know you're looking for a reaction, but listen we have two great candidates in a very tight race...and at the end of the day the voters will decide who best can represent this party in the fall.}
<C>__{chris mathews}
<D>__{i understand jack but doesn't this kind of disruption take away from what you want to be pushing this year?}
<A>__{back to stephen}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{your dad is an asshole.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i will tell him you said that.}
<C>__{stephen}

<C>__{molly}
<D>__{you said you wanted to talk to me about something?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{yeah, i just wanted...i just wanted to be clear about everything...so there's no confusion...}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i won't tell anyone about last night.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{well yeah, i'd appreciate it if we kept this...i mean, you know how people are.}
<C>__{molly}

<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i was?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{totally.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i thought i was being all smooth and subtle.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{you were pretty forward.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{you were pretty forward ...inviting me to the bar.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{well...i've been trying to fuck you for a while.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{wow.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{pretty slutty of me, huh?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{no, not at all...i mean i kind of respect it in a weird sort of way.}
<C>__{molly}
