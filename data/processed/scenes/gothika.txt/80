<L>__{interior miranda's office}
<A>__{miranda shuts the door behind her and slips behind her computer. shrouded in darkness. hits a switch and a surveillance monitor comes to life. now she has a view of the corridors: two guards here, a nurse going for a smoke, a janitor at the coffee machine and so on. she switches on her computer and taps her fingers as she waits for it to boot up.}
<B>__{on surveillance monitor}
<A>__{the janitor with his coffee cup now heading back towards miranda's office corridor miranda glances at the door, can see the glare of the computer screen reflecting against the glass pane. she tries opening drawers but they're all locked. she remembers something and digs a sweatshirt from beneath the couch, uses it to block the light. computer powered up, she runs an online search for "rachel parsons." waits as the info appears }
<C>__{miranda}
<P>__{(to self)}
<D>__{alright. what happened to you?}
<B>__{on computer screen}
<A>__{various listings: the archive news of her funeral, something about her search and a local news article about teen suicide. that's the one she chooses. hits "printerior" she checks the surveillance monitor again: the janitor now mops right outside her door.}
<B>__{on printout}
<A>__{the heading says "what drives our teenagers to suicide?" a quick glimpse gives us ages (16, 18, 17) and names of three local girls who have died. rachel's name and photograph appears with two others: jenny dixon and andrea white. miranda pockets it, looks back at the surveillance monitor: the janitor is walking away. she watches him disappear down the hall. slowly but surely. and now the screen is empty. but just for a second. because suddenly rachel is there. staring straight at her. makes us jump.}
