<L>__{exterior yard behind building saigon night}
<A>__{a tiny light glows inside a paper lantern. lying on the around are three corpses, all of them asian, all of them expensively dressed and all of them with their heads blown off. as nick stands looking at them a door comes open on the back of the building,and two burly men bring out another corpse. the body is that of a young american. like the asians he is expensively dressed and he is dead from a bullet in the right temple.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{if you are brave and lucky i can make you rich.}
<A>__{nick turns. a man is standing in the shadows of a small grape arbor, eyeing him with a look of cold amusement. the man's accent is french. beside him, on a small white table, is a bottle of champagne and several glasses.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{you have played?}
<A>__{nick stares at the man, nods.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{once you have played it is not so hard. cigarette?}
<A>__{nick shakes his head.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{you seem... disturbed.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i... no. you do this for money?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{mais certainment... a great deal of money. naturally i do not do it myself. i myself do not possess the nerve.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{but i am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... it is a thing quite rare. champagne perhaps? tch, tch. don't say no. when a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.}
<P>__{(gives nick a glass)}
<D>__{where did you play?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{up north.}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{we... three bullets.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{and then you...}
<A>__{the man makes a clicking sound, three times, as if firing a pistol. nick nods.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{how extremely clever. that is really most extraordinaire... allow me please to introduce myself. i am armand... and you are?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{nick.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{nick. c'est extraordinaire! do you know that i have a cousin who is called nicholas and a nephew nickolai. so you are, comme on dit, en famille. in the family.}
<A>__{there is another shot from inside and another round of}
<B>__{applause.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i have to go.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{but you must come in.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no, i }
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{but i insist.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i have to go.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{you are frightened, no?}
<A>__{nick nods.}
<C>__{armand }
<D>__{of what is there to be afraid? the war? the war is no problem. it is a joke, a silly thing. i make one call and get you out.}
<A>__{armand refills nick's glass. nick looks at it. the glass is as thin as paper and the sparkling bubbles dance and hiss. nick lifts the glass and empties in one swallow.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{see, i'm going home.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{ah yes. of course.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{to the girl who waits.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(gives him a look and sits)}
<D>__{yeah... do you mind if i sit?}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{but of course! please make yourself comfortable. perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or ?}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(weary, shaking his head)}
<D>__{no. none of that.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{unfortunately i must now go in, but i leave you my card. naturellement i pay my players cash american. just so you know.}
<A>__{armand disappears in the darkness. then his voice comes again.}
<D>__{armand (v.o.) (cont'd) however, should you prefer german marks, or perhaps swiss francs, this of course can be arranged. everything can be arranged.}
<A>__{armand moves around the side of the building and the sound of his footsteps fades away. the two burly men come lurching with another corpse. laughter comes from inside the building and there is a glimpse of an elegantly dressed woman seated at a cafe table. the burly men return to the door and shut it tight. in the distance the sky goes up in a huge flash of fire and then the sound of the explosion rolls across the city like a great dead wind.}
