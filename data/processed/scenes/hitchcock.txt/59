<A>__{hitch knocks at the door.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{are you decent my dear?}
<A>__{janet steps out dressed in a crisp, sexy white shirt and pencil skirt. she does a twirl for him. the effect is stunning. even the stagehands stop to watch.}
<C>__{janet leigh}
<D>__{am i alright?}
<A>__{his picks a tiny piece of lint on her sleeve.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{perfect.}
<A>__{as he escorts her onto the soundstage, tony comes up to greet them.}
<C>__{anthony perkins}
<D>__{i want to thank you again for this opportunity, mr. hitchcock.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{it's just "hitch", tony. hold the cock.}
<A>__{janet caught that she's clearly amused. tony gives her a gracious peck on the cheek.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{look at you two. america's favorite boy and girl nextdoor...}
<A>__{janet flicks a glance back at hitch.}
<C>__{janet leigh}
<D>__{and we're about to move to a whole new neighborhood.}
<A>__{already, tony can't help feel a little excluded from hitch and janet's little clique. hitch ushers them across the soundstage where the crew are assembling.}
<C>__{vera miles}
<D>__{morning janet. morning tony.}
<A>__{vera miles marches up in her frumpy tweed suit and wig.}
<C>__{vera miles }

<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<P>__{(already moving past her)}
<D>__{that's hand woven imported camel hair from rodier. don't you approve?}
<C>__{vera miles}
<D>__{you're the genius.}
<A>__{she checkmates him with a ravishing smile.}
<C>__{vera miles }

<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{everyone's is. until alma finishes the revisions. now hurry along, vera. you're just in time for the oath.}
<C>__{vera miles}
<D>__{the what?}
<A>__{he steers her towards a line of laughing crew members forming a circle with the rest of the cast. he takes janet by the hand, placing her right next to him and officiously raises his right hand. the cast and crew duly follow suit, all except for vera.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{i solemnly promise...}
<C>__{crew}
<D>__{i solemnly promise...}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<P>__{(ignoring vera's sarcasm)}
<D>__{that i will not divulge the plot nor the many secrets of psycho...}
<C>__{crew}
<D>__{that i will not divulge the plot nor the many secrets of psycho...}
<A>__{we see vera's crossed fingers behind her back then tilt up to janet's look of mock disapproval. vera pokes her tongue out.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{to friends, relatives, trade reporters or columnists not even to outgoing president dwight d. eisenhower, god bless him.}
<A>__{everyone cracks up, but hitchcock's only interested in the reaction of his new blonde, standing in pride of place, right beside him.}
