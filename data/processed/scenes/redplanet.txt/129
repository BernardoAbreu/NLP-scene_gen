<L>__{exterior mars surface night}
<A>__{the two men run. lit by the two moons phobos and deimos fear and terror. it's unbelievably cold. plumes of breath light up around them as they go. following the star on the horizon. across a valley, over a ridge. over a dune. scrambling. up and over the next long, long gradient. they lose the star over this false horizon as they climb. there's something odd, however. a faint broad wash of light coming over the lip. they crest the rise to reveal }
<B>__{valley}
<A>__{completely covered in phosphorescent algae. pale green and glowing. a mile across, a mile wide. if they weren't rushing for their lives, it would be worth stopping to stare. across the vale canis minor sits directly in the center of a small mountain pass. they're about to dash onward when something intuition, it's hard to say what hits burchenal.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{stop.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{burchenals' not quite sure at first. but won't enter the algae. walks left, walks right. kneels down. the algae glows. otherworldly. and then movement. in the f.g. a worm, green, glowing and filled with algae, slithers through. and then another. and another, indistinguishable from the plants around them they've imbibed. and then as burchenal plays his light out across the valley we realize it's entirely full of worms. gallagher takes an appalled step back. they're fucked.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{we're fucked.}
<A>__{burchenal considers for a moment. and yeah, probably has that epiphany. then }
<C>__{burchenal}
<P>__{(re the pass)}
<D>__{get to the closest point you can safely. i'm gonna go down to that end.}
<A>__{he starts to run to the far end.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{what are you gonna do?}
<A>__{burchenal's far enough away now that his voice comes over the suit radio.}
<C>__{burchenal }
<D>__{i'm gonna distract them.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{you're gonna distract the worms??}
<C>__{burchenal }
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{perhaps gallagher ought to give this more thought. but he doesn't. maybe it's the exhaustion. maybe it just never would have occurred to him. burchenal disapears into the darkness and the distance. gallagher waits. then }
<C>__{burchenal }
<D>__{you ready?}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{burchenal }
<D>__{good. lemme know when it starts to clear.}
<A>__{gallagher doesn't get it. but a moment later, a shiver runs through the worms. and they start to undulate away. towards burchenal. pulsing faster and faster until it's clear in a moment or two, like a giant amoebae withdrawing, he will have clear access to the pass.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<A>__{at the far end, is five hundred yards into the worms. they know. they've told each other. and they're coming in pulsating waves. towards him. at the epicenter. he gags. and hears }
<C>__{gallagher }
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{it's clear.}
<A>__{burchenal tries to turn around. he's mired now. and they're up to his waist. it's a fucking nematode feeding frenzy.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{he can't even lift his feet. they're beginning to cover him now. he can see the color of his suit spreading around him as they devour it.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<P>__{(then; oddly calm)}
<D>__{you were right, son. there's gotta be a reason. this can't just be an accident. i don't know what the worms're doing here or how they got here. but science don't explain it. and it pisses me off to no end.}
<A>__{gallagher turns. he can see now what burchenal has done. a tiny glowing figure can be seen 1000 yards away. gallagher's speechless at first...}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{i'm gonna have to turn off my radio in a sec. so you don't have to hear me screaming like a girl.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{what have you done??}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{finding out there's things i don't understand. that science don't know squat about. maybe even the damn earth's worth saving. someone's gotta give it a try. gotta find out about these worms. go, get off this fucking planet.}
<A>__{during which we've cut to g: allagher, 'cause you don't want to see this.}
<C>__{burchenal }
<D>__{there's two women in missoula, one in bozeman. tell them each they were my last words. and make sure my horse gets sold to someone who knows how to ride.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{oh, my lord...}
<A>__{radio goes silent. across the distance we can see a figure, now entirely coated in luminous worms, writhing wildly. gallagher leaves his light on, starts to run. as robby flees, we pull back, further and further until he's just a tiny figure in the landscape until we are at what was burchenal. the frenzy is all but over. the phosphorescence is gone in the center of the circle. the edges are the color of his suit. then blood red for forty yards. bits of bone white. and then right in the dead center, as we watch; gray, spreading, spreading as what was once burchenal's brain is food for worms.}
