<D>__{what?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{take your seatbelt off.}

<D>__{don't you know anything, lloyd? ninety percent of all accidents happen within five miles of home. we've already traveled 6.3 miles.}
<A>__{lloyd thinks about this. then:}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{well what about the people who live around here? what if we got into an accident with one of them?}
<A>__{harry considers this, then sheepishly puts his seatbelt back on. lloyd opens a bag of doritos and fiddles with the radio.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{where'd you get those?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{bought 'em when we filled up.}
