<A>__{asteroids collide, creating a fireworks display outside the bridge window. darth vader stands, staring out the window above the control deck. then slowly turns toward the bridge. before him are the hologram images of twenty battleship commanders. one of these images, the commander of a ship that has just exploded, is fading away quickly. another image, in the center and a little apart from the others, is faded and continually disrupted by static. it is the image of captain needa, commander of the star destroyer most hotly on the tail of the millennium falcon. admiral piett and an aide stand behind the dark lord.}

<C>__{vader}
<D>__{yes, admiral, what is it?}
<A>__{the admiral is scared, his face white as a sheet.}
