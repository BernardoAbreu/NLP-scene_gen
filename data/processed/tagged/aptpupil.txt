<A>__{a boy is seated near the back of a moving bus. this is todd bowden, 15, as all american as they come. he stares out at the other passengers indifferently. then something catches his eye.}
<L>__{exterior residential street santo donato day}
<A>__{title: santo donato, ca february 1984 todd pedals his bike down a quiet street and pulls up to an unassuming bungalow set far back on its lot. this is the kind of house one would hardly notice driving through the peaceful suburban community of santo donato. todd gets off his bike and heads up the front steps. on the way, he bends down to pick up the l.a. times. two signs, in laminated plastic, are secured neatly above the door bell. the first reads: "arthur denker". the second reads: "no solicitors, no peddlers, no salesmen". todd rings the bell. nothing. he looks at his watch. it is twelve past ten. he rings again, this time longer. still nothing. finally, todd leans on the tiny button, staring at his watch as he does so. after more than a minute of solid ringing, a voice is heard from within.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{all right. all right. i'm coming. let it go!}
<A>__{todd lets go as a chain behind the heavy door starts to rattle. then it opens. an old man stands behind the screen. he is kurt dussander, a.k.a. arthur denker. mid seventies. standing there in his bathrobe and slippers, a cigarette smashed in his mouth, he looks like a cross between boris karloff and albert einstein. dussander stares at todd, who tries to speak, but suddenly cannot.}

<D>__{a boy. i don't need anything, boy. can't you read? i thought all american boys could read. don't be a nuisance, now. good day.}

<C>__{todd}
<D>__{don't forget your paper, mr. dussander.}
<A>__{the door stops. dussander opens it slowly. he unlatches the screen and slips his fingers around the paper. todd does not let go.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{give me my newspaper.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{sure thing, mr. dussander.}
<A>__{dussander snatches the paper away and closes the screen door. quickly, almost imperceptibly, the old man's eyes survey the area: across the street, up and down the sidewalk, the boy's bicycle.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{my name is denker. see?}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{denker. perhaps you cannot read after all. what a pity. good day.}

<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{you get away from this house, god damn you! i will beat you all the way home.}
<A>__{but todd regains his composure quickly. he brushes himself off and levels his eyes at the old man who now hardly seems the threat he was a few seconds ago.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{after 1965, no one saw you again... until i did. three weeks ago on the downtown bus. if you want to call the cops, go right ahead. i'ii wait on the steps.}

<D>__{you'll do no such thing.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i won't? listen, old man, if i want to start screaming right here, i will. if i want to ride down to the police station and bring the cops back myself, then i will. i will do what ever i want. do you understand?}

<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{is that what you want, to come into my home? so be it. there is no arguing with crazy people.}
<A>__{dussander turns and steps back through the screen door. he stops at the threshold of the house and turns. he is holding the screen door open with one leg, the front door open with the other. he looks straight ahead. a moment later, todd steps into the house.}
<L>__{interior dussander's house day}
<A>__{dussander's home is what you would expect of a single, poor, old man. nothing fancy, nothing out of the ordinary. todd looks around, perhaps half expecting to find a nazi flag or an oil painting of der fuehrer hanging above the mantle. but he doesn't, and moves into the living room where an old picture of a woman sits framed on an end table.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{my wife. she died in 1955 of lung disease. at that time i was working at the menschler motor works in essen. i was heartbroken.}
<A>__{todd's attention drifts away and his fingers slip over to a lampshade next to the photograph. he begins to feel it as though he were inspecting it for something.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{stop that!}

<C>__{todd}

<D>__{your hands are shaking.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{yes, they're shaking. i'm old. we all shake. you are most tiresome, and rude. now if you have a point i wish you'd come to it.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{we're in no rush. if i thought you had plans, i'd say cancel them, but since i know you don't...}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{you know nothing of my business }
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{what business? you sit in that ugly chair and watch soap operas all day. except on friday afternoons when you walk down to the movie theater. and twice a week you take the bus downtown to do your shopping. you always use the express lane because you never have more than ten items.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{you have been following me?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{of course, i followed you. you think i normally go around to peoples' houses and accuse them of being nazi fugitives?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{perhaps for me you made an exception.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{no, for you i had to be sure. for kurt dussander i had to be absolutely certain. ...now, i am, and that's why i'm here.}
<A>__{todd sits on the sofa.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{oh, yes, i see now. as i am this ex nazi fellow, as you say, then this must be the part where i offer you my hidden stash of gold, taken from the mouths of old jewish men, of course, which i keep buried in the basement. isn't that right, boy? well, i'm afraid you're wasting your time. i have no money. if i did i might even give you some just to be done with this nonsense.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i don't need money. you don't have any anyway. at least, i don't think so. you probably had to spend it all to sneak in the country. a good american passport is expensive on the black market, that i know.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{do you? good for you.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{yes, i do. i know it all, dussander. you're my one great interest.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{your what?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{my one great interest. well, not you personally, but, ...well, it's something i learned back in eighth grade. our teacher, miss harmon, she said we'd have to find our one great interest in life. you know, the thing that would really grab us. once we did that, everything would fall into place. like hers, she said, wasn't teaching, but collecting nineteenth century postcards. i guess there's no money in that, so she has to be a teacher. anyway, she told us to start thinking about it. so i did, but nothing happened. until the following summer, in ronny pegler's garage. that's where i found it.}
<L>__{interior ronny pegler's garage day}
<A>__{todd and ronny, both 13, rummage through several large boxes in the corner of the garage. we see that the boxes are filled with old war magazines. ronny tosses several of them to the ground as he digs for his dad's old copies of penthouse. ronny selects one penthouse and rifles through it. he discards it a moment later.}
<C>__{ronny}
<D>__{one of these has three girls doing it at the same time.}
<A>__{but the old war magazines catch todd's attention. he picks one up curiously and carefully flips through the tattered pages. we see a few of the photographs: nazi storm troopers, prisoners behind barbed wire, the ovens.}
<C>__{ronny }
<D>__{i got it! check this out. ...todd, look.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{hang on a sec.}
<A>__{as young todd stares into this secret world, his voice comes in...}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{it was all there... pictures of stuff i'd never seen, stuff they never put in the books anymore, especially the ones they give us to read. and here were stacks of them.}
<L>__{interior dussander's living room day}
<A>__{todd speaks excitedly. dussander, very bored, clearly indulges him.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{it... grabbed me. it was just like miss harmon said. i couldn't believe it. but there it was, the camps, the uniforms, the ...the way they saluted each other. but what am i telling you for? you know more about this stuff than anybody.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{yes, what are you telling me for?}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(ignoring him)}
<D>__{then last year i wrote my big term paper on dachau. i got an a+. it was the only a+ she gave. i mean i always do real well. a's on everything. that's why i'm accelerated.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{accelerated?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you know, accelerated. i skipped two grades, second and ninth. i didn't need them. that's why i'm already a junior.}
<A>__{dussander sits.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i see...}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{some kids resent me for it. that's not important. anyway, my paper really floored my history teacher. i guess because i got through all those books without throwing up. but i learned something. i learned that when you talk about the camps now, you have to remember to sound really disgusted. i mean, you can't just say what happened like the magazines did and leave it at that. if i tried that the teacher would have freaked and called my parents in.}
<L>__{interior ronny pegler's garage dusk}
<A>__{todd sits on one of the boxes surrounded by dozens of the old magazines. the door to the house opens and ronny, looking cross, pokes his head out.}
<C>__{ronny}
<D>__{todd, your mom's on the phone. she says you have to come home for dinner. ...todd?}
<A>__{todd, lost in the sea of old photographs, doesn't notice ronny at first. then he looks up at him. in his eyes is a glint of a darkness that we will come to know better.}

<P>__{(suddenly wary of todd)}

<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{why do i care about this?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{because, i don't want it softened.}
<A>__{todd hops up and begins to pace the floor. dussander stares at him blankly, unsure of where this is going.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i am sure you trouble your parents to no end.}

<D>__{actually, i'm pretty low maintenance. that's what my dad says.}

<D>__{you think i'm crazy?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i think you're crackers, but go on. i'm riveted.}

<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{and then it happened... i was on my way to the library. it was raining...}
<A>__{flashback: interior city bus day todd's voice narrates what we are seeing. todd, seated near the back of the bus, watches dussander climb aboard. todd thinks nothing of it at first, but soon finds that he is unable to take his eyes off him. todd is trying to place the old man's face in his mind...}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{you climbed on the bus and started this slow walk down the aisle. just like you were examining a new batch of inmates. i don't think anybody gave you a second glance but me, but somehow ...people seemed to move out of your way. and under your arm you carried a rolled up umbrella. but what really did it, what really set me off was the coat. you were wearing this long black rain coat. my mind suddenly flipped back to a picture of you taken at patin. you in your s.s. greatcoat with a riding crop under your arm.}
<L>__{interior dussander's living room day}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{it was incredible.}
<A>__{dussander stares back at him flatly.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{all of this... because of a rain coat?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{well, it wasn't that easy. i mean, i had to really check up on it. and every picture of you in those books is forty years old, at least. i went back to the library to find the picture. and then i matched it with the photos i took.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{you took photographs of me?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{yeah, i got this little camera. fits right in the palm of my hand.}
<C>__{dussander}
<P>__{(crunches cigarette into ashtray)}
<D>__{clever boy.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{but even then i couldn't be sure. i needed real proof. so i went to the mall and bought a fingerprint kit from the hobby shop and a book that tells you what you're supposed to look for and then dusted your mailbox while you were at the movies. pretty smart, huh?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{you... put dust on my mailbox? for fingerprints? you took photographs of me? what else did you do?... i don't believe any of this.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i already had a copy of your fingerprints. they're on your want sheet from the israeli government. it's on database at uc irvine. can you believe that?}

<D>__{no kok.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{milk?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{milk.}
<A>__{dussander disappears into the kitchen. todd stands alone in the living room. he lets out a long, nervous breath, showing for the first time the presence of something other than the cold confidence he has been putting up for dussander. he knows he has crossed into dangerous territory from which there is no going back. but after a moment he composes himself; he has come this far. the sternness returns to his eyes. todd is all business. he takes a breath, and then speaks loudly enough for dussander to hear him in the kitchen.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{it takes eight good matches, they're called compares, actually, for a fingerprint to get accepted in court.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{is that right?}

<D>__{you should be a detective.}

<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{boy, i will tell you this once more, and for the last time. my name is arthur denker. it has never been anything else. it has never even been americanized. if you must know, and apparently you must, i was named by my father who greatly admired the stories of arthur conan doyle. i did serve in the reserves, i admit, and in the late thirties, when i was first married, i supported hitler. i supported him most, i suppose, because for the first time in years there was work and there was tobacco. ...would you like a cigarette?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{no. my dad used to smoke. mom made him quit. now he's addicted to nicorette... that's nicotine gum.}

<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{anyway, hitler lost his mind at the end, directing phantom armies at the whim of his astrologer. he even gave his dog, blondi, a death capsule. on may 2nd, 1945, my regiment surrendered to the americans. i remember that a private named gonzales gave me a chocolate bar. i wept.}

<D>__{why should i? why should i do any of it?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{because you hung up the phone. that's why. ...and just so you know, just so there is no misunderstanding whatsoever. everything i have on you, the compares, the want sheet, all the photographs, are all in an envelope under my mattress. i'm going to put it there every time i come to see you. if anything happens to me, if i should suddenly disappear, some one will find it. believe me }

<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{french}
<D>__{so let's get to the bottom line, shall we? what i'm proposing is some family counselling at the counselling center downtown. everything is in confidence, of course. a man in charge down there, harry shumacher, is a good friend of mine. i think todd and his parents should go see him together. it might be difficult for todd to go to his parents with this; i think you should do it. maybe we can get everybody on track by the end of the next quarter. it will be tough, but not impossible.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i'm not sure that would be the best thing for the boy. the parents might resent him if i took them that proposal right now. things are very delicate. to swing the scale too far in the wrong direction might cause more harm than good. the boy has promised to work harder in his studies. he is most concerned by the drop in his grades, more alarmed than you might expect. he has his mind set on attending stanford or berkeley next fall and does not wish to see his plans altered.}

<D>__{i have a great deal of experience in these matters, mr. bowden. and please understand that my interest in your son's marital problems begins and ends with the effect they are having on todd. and right now i think they are having quite an effect. i really think counselling is in order here.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{allow me to make a counter proposal. you have, i believe, a system for warning parents of poor grades?}
<C>__{french}
<D>__{yes, interpretation of progress cards. iop cards. the kids call them flunk card. they only get them when their grades in a class fall below the seventy percent. that means a "d" or an "f". why?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{and they are sent out when?}
<C>__{french}

<D>__{hey there.}
<A>__{todd looks up. he seems pleasant, but there is little warmth in his voice.}

<D>__{here. take it.}
<A>__{todd grabs the scope. but joey doesn't let go. he finally locks todd in a stare that he has been avoiding for months. he wants to say something. todd takes the scope. he sees that joey is serious. he takes a few steps toward the edge, toward the gun. he looks out.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{it's such a rush, you know?... to be up here. don't you feel it? so high above them they never know we're here. it's like an ant farm. we're the gods on mt. olympus, joey. they can't see us, they can't hear us, but every so often we can make them feel us. just so they never forget. look...}
<A>__{he looks through the scope at the freeway. he picks out passing cars.}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{there goes a future track star. there goes a judge. a mom and her two kids. a policeman. that one's a school teacher, that one's a drug dealer... you see, joey, it doesn't matter. it doesn't matter how smart you are ...or how many grades you skip. there's always someone who can take it all away. the right person snaps their fingers... and it's done.}

<C>__{joey}
<D>__{todd, i'm gonna go. i'm gonna... walk home.}

<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{what a mess.}
<A>__{he rises slowly and brushes himself off before heading down the steps to finish the bum for good. after about three steps he stops abruptly. he appears puzzled, but after a moment the expression changes. a look of searing pain rushes across his face. dussander brings his hand to his chest. he collapses on the stairs. he is having a heart attack and knows it.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{oh my god.}
<A>__{he looks down at archie, up to the kitchen, then back down to the cellar. a moment of decision. the stairs appear ten times longer in each direction than they did a minute ago. getting to his feet, he turns slowly toward the kitchen. he starts up the steps at a painfully slow pace, counting with each step.}

<A>__{todd smacks the back of the shovel on the finished grave to pack the dirt, then smooths the area over to destroy any markings. he is sweaty, dirty, and tired. but his manner is cool and efficient as he concentrates intently on the matters at hand. he runs upstairs, hopping over the bloody spot where archie's body used to be.}

<C>__{todd}
<D>__{that's right. i was. that's what i was doing there. it was in german but he insisted i try to read it anyway. once or twice he got pissy about the pronunciation but i asked him what did he want from me. i don't speak german. mr. denker... dussander... got really excited at one pointerior he yelled out, "yes, that's what you would do all right." but i didn't know what he was talking about. then he grabbed his chest.}

<C>__{richler}
<D>__{why not, todd?}
<C>__{todd}

<A>__{dussander lurches up in the bed in a spastic, contortive fit as the air embolism reaches his heart. his arm flails against the iv unit, sending it crashing to the floor. the monitors next to him reflect a drastic turn in his condition. the door flies open and a pair of nurses charae in through the swarm of journalists. richler and weiskopf run in and the eager cameramen follow. the room is bathed in flash explosions as the nurses try to subdue dussander.}
<L>__{interior bowden house garage day}
<A>__{todd throws open a cabinet door above the workbench and eyes the boxes and boxes of ammunition. he lets out a beautifully wicked laugh as he dumps all of the cartons into his backpack. he leaves the cabinet door open as he slips the bag over his shoulder.}
<L>__{exterior bowden house driveway street day}
<A>__{todd zooms out of the garage on his bike, the rifle slung over one shoulder, the backpack over the other. he zips past french's body and out into the street. in the distance, we hear the faint, but rising wail of sirens. a front door or two slams shut as todd passes. suddenly he cuts up between two houses. a man standing in his back yard sees todd and freezes. todd ignores him. he steers the bike through the yard and picks up the dirt path he has used so many times before.}

<A>__{from above we see dussander's eyes, wide open, motionless. yet the expression on his face is one of odd satisfaction. a doctor pounds on his chest, barks orders. the trauma team prepares the defibrillator, but we know they are too late...}
<L>__{exterior dirt path day}
<A>__{todd rides fast over the dry, rocky ground. the wind streaks back his hair. his excitement is as palpable as the grin dancing across his face. an aerial shot follows him as he angles the bike off the trail and up a steep embankment. as the camera moves ahead of him, we see the crest of the hill, and beyond it... the freeway, teeming with rush hour traffic.}
