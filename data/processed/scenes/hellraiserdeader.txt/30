<L>__{interior subway platform night}
<A>__{amy stands on the platform as the door hisses shut. the train pulls away. she checks her watch, then moves to the other side of the platform. she looks down the tunnel. the light from an approaching train is beginning to reflect off the curved wall of the tunnel. she turns back in the direction she just looked. far down the platform, there's a bench with a lone occupant a slumped over figure dressed in a shiny green raincoat. she turns toward it, staring. in the distance, no details of face or form are visible just the lumpy figure in the shiny green raincoat. she takes a step toward it, but still cannot make out any detail in the slumped over figure. she approaches... as does the train. there is no sign of movement. she comes around, closer to the edge of the platform, to get a more direct view of the green coated form. as she does, she sees that one hand is draped off the front edge of the bench, hanging limp. the hand is gray. amy takes a step forward. his eyes pop open! he looks at her with large black eyes, dead eyes. dripping from beneath his raincoat is a small pool of fresh blood. amy gasps, takes a step back and her heel lands on the edge of the subway platform. she struggles for balance. abruptly, a man's voice comes from somewhere.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{amy klein!}
<A>__{amy stumbles forward, goes down to her knees and turns. around twenty feet behind her, standing on the edge of the platform, with his back toward the drop, is winter, wearing a black trench coat, cinched at the waist. he looks down the tunnel. amy does as well. the train is coming into the station. she turns back toward winter. he stares at her, with malevolent eyes. and as the train comes flying in, he calmly falls backward, directly into its path. amy screams. in an instant she's up, running alongside the braking train. the doors open, but virtually nobody comes out. the front of the train is still far ahead.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{hey! you hit someone! someone fell in front of the train! hey! hey!}
<A>__{the doors hiss and start to close. finally, amy reaches the front window of the train. she hammers on it. it opens and a middle aged woman's face leans out the driver.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{somebody fell... somebody fell in front of the train.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{where? where is he? where'd he fall?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{back there, way back...}
<A>__{she looks back in the direction from which she's come. the bench is now empty.}
<C>__{t}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{aw, damn... dammit!}
<A>__{amy, though, is now looking, this way and that at the confused faces of people peeking out through the doors of the train. there is no sign of winter}
