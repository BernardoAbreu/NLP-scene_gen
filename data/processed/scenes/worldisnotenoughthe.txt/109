<A>__{the henchman holds davidov against the wall with his huge fist around his neck. near his head, the live flame of a sconce hisses, burning blue and yellow, drawing their fuel from the glass basin of hot oil attached beneath it. the hooker, obviously one of renard's gang, has finished donning her khaki pants and combat boots and straps a gun onto her shoulder. renard looks distastefully at the room.}

<D>__{is this how you spend the money i pay you? and with the rest you hire fools who shoot like blind men?}

<D>__{bond...}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{should be dead as well. your failure today is astonishing. it is a disgrace.}
<A>__{he approaches close to him, stopping at the flaming sconce near his head.}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{do you know why the color is blue at the wick?}
<A>__{davidov starts to sweat.}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{because that is where the flame is the hottest.}
<A>__{renard touches the glass well of oil.}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{the temperature is close to five hundred degrees.}
<A>__{renard uses his knife and pops the seal from the lamp, removing the well of oil...a drop of the hot oil falls on his hand and singes it black in an instant... renard does not even flinch. davidov starts talking, trying to placate...}

<D>__{the plane...it's all been arranged...}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{then you are completely unnecessary...}
<A>__{renard raises the container of oil over davidov's head:}
<C>__{davidov}
<D>__{i have the documents, the landing authorizations, the security passes...}
<A>__{renard stops, the oil tilted, just ready to pour... his dead eye...has it drooped further since we last saw him?...seems to glitter in the light...}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{bond is suspicious. we are moving sooner, tonight. we understand each other?}
<C>__{davidov}
<D>__{yes...yes...}
<A>__{renard lets a trickle of oil drop onto davidov's head... he screams as his hair smokes and singes... renard makes a motion, the thug releases davidov, who falls to the floor, clutching his head.}
