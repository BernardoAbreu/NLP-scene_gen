<P>__{(commiseratingly)}
<D>__{times is hard,}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{well, let's get to it.}
<A>__{he begins dealing and splitting the money out on the hood of the car, as they gather around.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{this is clyde barrow.}

<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{hah?}
<A>__{buck is clearly embarrassed.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{uh, clyde...well...what about blanche?}
<A>__{everyone reacts with stunned amazement at blanche's nerve in wanting to get her cut.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{blanche sees she has to rise to her own defense, and she rises to the occasion with spirit and verve.}
<C>__{blanche}
<D>__{well, why not? say i earned my share! same as everybody. i coulda got killed same as everybody, and i'm wanted by the law same as everybody. besides i coulda got snake bit sleepin' in them woods every night!}
<P>__{(building it up)}
<D>__{i'm just a nervous wreck and that's the truth. and i have to listen to sass from miss bonnie parker all the time. i deserve mine!}
<A>__{close. buck. day looking at clyde, his face full of weak smiles and embarrassment at his wife.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(with a sigh)}
<D>__{okay...okay...hold your horses, blanche. you'll get your share.}
<A>__{bonnie is livid but says nothing. clyde, the leader has decided. c.w. looks indignant, like a hog who's just been given a bath. clyde begins counting all over again in near silence.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{married a preacher's daughter and she still thinks she's takin' the collection.}
<A>__{everyone now laughs, but blanche. clyde continues counting.}
<C>__{buck}
<P>__{(to blanche)}
<D>__{well, don't spend it all in one place now, hear?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{she'll be doin' right well to spend it at all.}
<A>__{bonnie turns and ambles away from the car. after a moment clyde stops counting and moves after her. he's prepared for a fight, stands behind bonnie's arched back trying to gauge the degree of hostility there.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{bonnie?}
<A>__{no answer.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(a little defensive)}
<D>__{look, bonnie, i've said it and i guess i will keep sayin' it before we're thru blanche is buck's wife and buck is family.}
<A>__{he waits expectantly.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(finally, utterly without malice)}
<D>__{ she's such a silly billy...}
<A>__{bonnie looks plaintively to clyde.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{my family could use some of that money.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{them laws have been hangin' round your mamas house 'til all hours, bonnie. it's just too risky to go there.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(exploding)}
<D>__{well, where can we go? we rob the damn banks, what else do we do?}
<A>__{clyde cannot really answer. suddenly c.w. starts yelling:}
<C>__{c.w.}
<D>__{clyde! clyde! clyde!}
<A>__{clyde flinches at the sound. c.w. comes bounding over, as rude an assault on their sensibilities as he can be.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(wincing as they are nose to nose)}
<D>__{i hear you, c.w.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<D>__{this ol' heap's gushin' oil! we got to swipe us another set of wheels right away, or we won't get anywhere. look here.}
<A>__{he reaches down under the pan of the car and scoops a gooey handful of slick black oil which he holds before their faces.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<D>__{see?}
<A>__{clyde nods slowly. he looks back to bonnie. he sees.}
