<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i want my fucking zippo now!}
<A>__{walter starts yanking at his hair.}
<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{walter, that is a behavior...}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(raking his nails against his forearm)}
<D>__{fuck you!}

<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i'm walter. kill anybody recently? run anybody over with a fucking car?}

<A>__{rosa takes two of kym's several bags. they are oddly matched. a coach tote, a fake prada, a gristedes bag, and a world wildlife fund tote bag.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you're not letting her get behind the wheel are you? are you?}
<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{walter, you are only responsible for yourself. (to kym) this is all your stuff?}

<D>__{you know you never gave me your cell number.}
<C>__{rosa}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{it was a mistake. i'm lucky i didn't get fired. we've discussed this. (she offers her hand) good luck.}
<A>__{kym doesn't appear to have heard her but she shakes the hand barely... so very, very faintly. kym's dad, paul buchman, a tired, prosperous man in his late}
