<L>__{exterior summit trail night}
<A>__{this "expedition" reaches the top hal is in the lead, with qualen just inches behind. qualen shoves hal forward.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{is this it?}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{yeah. this is it.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{good. get out of the way.}
<A>__{travers takes out the tracer and starts following the blip. elsewhere on the summit gabe frantically rushes around, looking for the case he spots a crater of snow, rushes to it and starts digging. even below the snow, the tracer's blinking red light is glowing and visible. gabe laughs as he digs it out. nearby on the summit travers has his eyes glued to the tracer monitor, which shows the case is nearby.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{this way.}
<A>__{qualen shines a light all of them push their way through the trees.}
<B>__{travers}
<A>__{is excited now he can't even wait for qualen's flashlight, he intuitively races through the trees, dividing his attention between his surroundings and}
<B>__{the monitor}
<A>__{which shows he's practically on top of the case finally}
<B>__{travers}
<A>__{shoves his way through some small pines he can see the blinking of the red tracer light ahead through the branches.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(calling behind)}
<D>__{it's over here!}
<A>__{travers shoves his way through the branches, and heads for the light but something's wrong qualen comes up behind travers and shines the light on}
<B>__{a snowman}
<A>__{cute, if hastily constructed, stands with a five pebble smile, as well as douglas' cap, in a clearing. the still blinking, still operable tracer is now the nose of the snowman. the case is leaned up against it. travers runs over to the case, furious, and opens it. it's empty except for a single $5000 bill. travers picks it up scrawled on the margin is "let's trade."}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{he's still alive.}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{he's still alive!}
<P>__{(to qualen and the others)}
<D>__{he can't be far away spread out!}
<A>__{qualen, kynette, delmer and krystel fan out into the woods, each with a flashlight and a fun. ryan, however, straps on nightfinder goggles and runs out without a flashlight.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(to hal, brandishing gun)}
<D>__{put your hands on your head.}
<A>__{elsewhere on the summit gabe watches the chaos with a grin from a slightly elevated vantage point he can see the flashlight beams, all headed in the wrong direction. but he doesn't see ryan "nightfinder" pov with these goggles, light is amplified a thousandfold this isn't one of those infra red, thermo blob jobs it looks more like day for night photography. even starlight is enough for ryan to run easily through the thick woods and he's going in the right direction.}
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{begins climbing down to level ground so he can circle closer to where travers is holding hal before he can get far "nightfinder" pov ryan looks up, and can clearly see gabe climbing down the small rock, twenty yards distant }
<B>__{ryan}
<A>__{smiles, looking macabre under the goggles, and opens fire }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{is startled as the bullets impact inches over his head he jumps the last ten feet to the ground and is running even as he hits the ground more bullets hit where gabe was a split second ago }
<B>__{ryan}
<A>__{chases gabe, easily maneuvering through the trees }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{runs too, trying to dodge ryan's continuing fusillades gabe knows this territory, but to him, it's still pitch dark he stumbles, and rams against trees }
<B>__{ryan}
<A>__{keeps coming up behind, closing the hap, gabe's bright form just ahead }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{comes out of the trees and finds he is on another part of the summit. all that's beneath him is gabe's pov a sudden, sloping plunge down a field of ice. no escape route here anything that goes down this slide is going all the way to the ground far below.}
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{is driven forward by a fresh burst of bullets he dives to the edge of the ice field and ducks behind a boulder the sole source of cover.}
<B>__{elsewhere on the summit}
<A>__{kristel, qualen and kynette, having heard the gunshots, are now rushing to gabe's position }
<B>__{ryan}
<A>__{almost casually emerges from the woods. he can see there is nowhere for gabe to have gone except behind the boulder. he walks toward it as if he had all the time in the world.}
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{fumbles in his backpack and pulls out something from the douglas exhibit an ancient flare that looks like a can of sterno. gabe pulls out his lighter and tries to light it it resists and looks like a dud, but finally it catches, and as it ignites gabe heaves it over the boulder at ryan ryan "nightfinder" pov the flare arcs over the boulder to fully ignite, turning everything into a blinding, agonizing flash of white }
<B>__{ryan}
<A>__{screams, putting one hand over the goggles, trying to rip them off }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{bolts out from behind the boulder to rush him }
<B>__{ryan}
<A>__{instantly aware of what gabe's doing, blindly shoots, fanning out in a semi circle as he gets the goggles off }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{just runs straight ahead to ryan, getting to him before the machine gun field of fire can intersect his path gabe tackles ryan as he manages to get the goggles off both men fall to the ground, and the machine gun clatters away, landing on the edge of the ice, just out of reach ryan, now recovered from the blinding flash, pulls an ice axe out of a pack sheath and swings it at gabe gabe rolls away in time, and gets to the machine gun, grabbing it but ryan dives for gabe, slamming into him the force of it knocks the machine gun loose it skips down the ice slope but the momentum of ryan's hit also carries both gabe and ryan over the edge, onto }
<B>__{the ice slope}
<A>__{gabe and ryan both tumble over the edge and start sliding down, ryan face first on his stomach, gabe head first and on his back both are in immediate agony, because}
<B>__{close on the ice}
<A>__{ it's covered with razor sharp, irregular ridges, both large and small, that slice through clothing and shred skin as they pick up speed gabe's upside down pov the ice field the edge and a five thousand foot drop are less than a hundred yards away }
<B>__{gabe and ryan sliding}
<A>__{ryan flails and screams as the ice gashes him from underneath gabe, however, manages to flip over and to the side he lunges on top of ryan and rides him down like a bobsled gabe's pov end of the ice slops is coming up too fast }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{tries to maintain his perch on ryan, who is screaming and not yet used to the idea of being a human sled he isn't remaining still enough to provide a smooth ride gabe frantically reaches behind to ryan's wrist to get the ice axe, trailing from a wrist strap, but ryan's arm is thrashing away, threatening to toss off the axe }
<B>__{on summit}
<A>__{qualen, kristel and kynette arrive at the lip, and look down, incredulous qualen pov gabe riding ryan gabe and ryan, accelerating, have almost reached the edge }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{finally grabs the ice axe, pulling it off ryan's wrist just as they reach the precipice edge, gabe loops the axe to his wrist and swings toward the ice with everything he's got the axe's scythe like blade catches on the ice, right at the lip of the precipice gabe is wrenched to a painful halt, suspended over the drop, as what's left of ryan, still screaming, shoots over the edge gabe unhooks the axe, and gets another handhold. gabe uses the axe to climb further down the ice to some rock finding easier hand holds, he quickly disappears into the darkness. qualen, kristel and kynette look down ryan's death scream is still echoing. qualen is furious gabe has escaped with the second case.}
<C>__{qualen}
<P>__{(to kynette)}
<D>__{follow him!}
<A>__{kynette shines his flashlight below, illuminating the long, frozen streak of blood on the ice.}
<C>__{kynette}
<P>__{(gestures with light)}
<D>__{after you.}
