<B>__{their pov}
<A>__{room empty, window open. carl strides to the window and hoists himself out. grimsrud opens the medicine cabinet and delicately taps aside various bottles and tubes, seeking the proper unguent. he finds a salve but after a moment sets it down, noticing something in the mirror. the shower curtain is drawn around the tub. he steps toward it. as he reaches for the curtain, it explodes outward, animated by thrashing limbs. jean, screaming, tangled in the curtain, rips it off its rings and stumbles out into the bedroom. grimsrud follows.}
