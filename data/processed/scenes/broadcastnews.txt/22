<D>__{no. it wasn't just the speech the same thing happened with this guy. i have passed some line some place. i am beginning to repel people i'm trying to seduce.}
<L>__{interior aaron's apartment night}
<A>__{as he talks with jane.}
<C>__{aaron}
<P>__{(agreeably)}
<D>__{he must have been great looking, right?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{why do you say that?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{because nobody invites a bad looking idiot to their bedroom.}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{okay. let's do me.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{okay. i feel like i'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{this conversation is not worthy of you.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{i'd give anything if that were true.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(laughing)}

<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive? if needy were a turn on?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{call if you get weird.}
