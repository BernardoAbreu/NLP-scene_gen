<L>__{exterior it's raining men parking lot night}
<A>__{dolly from the front end of a jaguar xke, michigan vanity plate reading: amanda. to its windshield, through which we see hawk and amanda kissing in the front seat, clad only in their underwear. something like "me and mrs. jones" plays on the radio. when they separate, amanda takes out a flask and offers it to hawk.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{he gulps some down and pulls the flask away coughing.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{what the hell is that?}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{gin.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{whoa. some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. i'm a brewski man myself.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{better ease up then, hawk. wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{who's whiskey dick?}
<A>__{amanda plants a stocking foot on hawk's crotch and rubs.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{well. obviously no one you have to worry about... woody.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{my name's not woody, it's haw haw...}
<A>__{hawk's eyes cross as he lets out a deep, obnoxious groan.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{...holy shit!}
<A>__{amanda looks down at his crotch.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{but you do know premature peter, don't you? shame, i just bought these stockings.}
<A>__{hawk has never been more embarrassed.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{well, amanda, this has been quite a night. so far you've seen me and my dick throw up.}
<P>__{(to the heavens)}
<D>__{what's next? projectile diarrhea?}
<P>__{(beat, to amanda)}
<D>__{man. what a stud, huh?}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon to be ex husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. the man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... the man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. the man for whom faking it was invented. christ, if i hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, i would have never known i even had sex with the prick.}
<A>__{she takes a healthy swig of gin, relishing its bitterness.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{you love him?}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{i just told you, he's a big, hairy...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{no, i mean... you love your son?}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{more than anything in the world.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{and he loves you back, doesn't he?}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{he's a little spoiled, but i know he does.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{well, shame on him if he doesn't.}
<A>__{she pats his shoulder.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{you're sweet.}
<A>__{hawk stares out the windshield.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{my mom died of a heart attack while she was having me. man, i wish i had known her for even one day. if they ever invent a time machine, that's what i'm doing. going back in time to meet my mom. i'm gonna say, "mrs. pitchford?... or miss williams, depending on when i show up. you don't know me, but i'm your kid from the future. just wanted to thank you for the blue eyes, pug nose and for tying the knot with a guy who didn't mind diaper detail... oh, and, uh... cut down on the red meat, will ya?"}
<A>__{amanda caresses hawk's cheek. he turns with her hand and kisses it. he takes her arm and begins kissing his way up to her neck, her cheek, her mouth...}
<C>__{dr. love to the rescue}
