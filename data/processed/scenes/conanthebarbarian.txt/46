<L>__{exterior desert day}
<A>__{tamara stumbles through a stretch of barren wasteland, the plumes of the oasis' sandstorm now off in the distance behind her. the sun mercilessly beats down upon her face, her lips are already chapped. she falls to her knees, unable to go on. she looks up, as the heat streams off the desert floor, creating a swirling mirage. through which the silhouette of a rider appears, followed by others.}
<B>__{slaver caravan}
<A>__{the horse drawn carts of the caravan are lined with iron bars, and behind the bars are a bevy of young women, mostly looking worse for wear. the head slaver rides ahead, and walks up to the heap of white cloth that is tamara.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{water please }
<A>__{he lifts her barely conscious head, eyeing her features, a greasy paw examining her body. he smiles.}
<C>__{head slaver}
<D>__{the gods are good.}
<P>__{(to the other slavers)}
<D>__{chain this one in my cage. she'll be the prize of the auction in khor kalba.}
