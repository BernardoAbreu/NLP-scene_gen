<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior wayne manor establishing night}
<A>__{a vast, rambling mansion on sixty wooded acres a half hour's drive from gotham: old money, and how. out front, a team of red jacketed valets are parking expensive cars.}
<L>__{interior ballroom night}
<A>__{a dealer's hand pushes cards out of a shoe (the card kind, not the florsheim kind). it's casino night at wayne manor; the ballroom has been outfitted with roulette wheels, blackjack tables, etc., and the various members of gotham's power elite are happily and legally throwing money into harvey dent's campaign kitty. dent himself is surrounded by a gang of political cronies, telling jokes, calling in favors. vicki's off in another group, looking luscious, drawing compliments from big shots and envious, furtive glances from their wives. and, in a corner of the room, all alone in his cheap suit, stands alexander knox staring inquisitively up at the ceiling. a butler, alfred, appears alongside knox with a trayful of champagne glasses. he too looks up at the ceiling.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{how high up would you say that is?}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{i'd say about thirty feet, sir.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{you know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{which bathroom is that, air?}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{the small one.}
<A>__{knox takes a drink and alfred moves on. a moment later, vicki detaches herself from her little circle of admirers and hooks up with knox.}
<C>__{knox }
<D>__{man, i feel like robin leach. you actually know all these people?}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{some. i am a rich bitch, remember.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i'm quoting.}
<A>__{knox winces at the reminder. she smiles and takes his arm.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{yeah, i guess we move in different circles. though i did meet a one eyed pimp last week.}
<B>__{angle on james w. gordon}
<A>__{gotham's police commissioner, a distinguished looking gent in his late fifties. he's at a craps table, blowing into his fist. onlookers root him on as he lets the dice fly. snake eyes. crapped out. gordon passes the dice as knox and vicki wander up alongside him.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{commissioner gordon! what do you hear from our pointy eared friend?}
<A>__{knox puts his hands up behind his head and wiggles his fingers like little bat ears. gordon groans.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{knox, for the ninth time, and you can quote me there is no bat.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{aww, commissioner. there's gotta be one honest cop in gotham city.}
<A>__{harvey dent is working the room. he ambles up, claps a friendly hand on gordon's shoulder.}
<C>__{dent}
<D>__{how's your luck, jim?}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{mr. dent. what's your stand on winged vigilantes?}
<A>__{dent exchanges a meaningful look with gordon.}
<C>__{dent}
<D>__{mr. knox, i think we have enough real problems in this city without worrying about ghosts and goblins and halloween characters.}
