<A>__{a large painting of the face of rafael is carried aloft on a stick, draped with red and black scarves. price photographs the boys and the painting. national guard soldiers shove into the parade up and down the street they spring into action, running for position with their guns. an ice cream vendor is knocked down, a mother clutches her "angel" daughter, another child is whisked inside a door as the soldiers break into the procession. the "muchachos" with rafael turn to run but realize that the soldiers have cut off their escape. three soldiers break into the parade and are separated from the boys only by a group of priests. trapped, the boys panic, but as the soldiers push towards them: the priests block the soldiers and intentionally scuffle with them, allowing the boys just enough time to dart into a house. one of the boys drops the picture of rafael as he heads in the door. the crowd pushes forward, the route to the door is blocked off, and the boys escape. soldiers find the portrait of rafael and shoot it full of holes with their automatic weapons. price photographs "rafael" as his image is ripped to shreds with bullets. the singing and the parade march on.}
