<L>__{interior meeting hall night}
<A>__{an aa meeting is in progress. an older woman stands at the podium sharing her story. the room is filled with different groups of people, all of whom sit with their "own group," like a high school lunch room but the people are adults. there are distinct groups of "pretty women" "obsessively tattooed people" "businessmen" and "hipsters." as kate who's slightly confused enters the building, a hip looking man donovan, 30's stops her, extending his hand.}

<B>__{later}
<A>__{the room is completely full with over one hundred people. the tattooed man stands at the podium.}
<C>__{tattoo man}
<D>__{not to embarrass anyone, but so that we may get to know you better is there anybody here in their first thirty days of recovery?}
<A>__{several people scattered throughout the room stand up and introduce themselves as alcoholics. kate stands up.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i'm kate. i...i'm...i guess i'm a little drunk right now.}
<A>__{people burst into laughter.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{do you want me to talk about my childhood or something?}
<C>__{tattoo man}
<P>__{(painfully polite)}
<D>__{you know, kate, we actually ask that you don't share if you've had a drink or any mind altering substance in the past 24 hours.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(not listening)}
<D>__{i can i kinda hate my dad and don't talk to him. and my mom...oh, man...i don't even know where to start. she's, like, stuck in the 80's and kind of a metalhead. her last boyfriend called himself a drummer but really just gave drum lessons to little kids and }
<C>__{tattoo man}

<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(not picking up the hint)}
<D>__{i like drinking is the thing. i mean, i don't want to say you guys are wrong or anything...}
<A>__{kate nervously laughs. some of the people in the crowd look embarrassed for kate.}
<C>__{tattoo man}
<D>__{thank you we're all here to help. we do have to move on, though.}
<A>__{the woman next to kate gets her to sit back down.}
