<D>__{the sword of damocles is hanging over my head.}
<A>__{frank runs down the ladder and kicks riff raff who starts to lower the chandelier. frank climbs up the other steps to meet his creation coming down. magenta & columbia cross to the tank.}

<D>__{and i've got the feeling someone's going to be cutting the thread. oh, woe is me. my life is a misery. oh, can't you see that i'm at the start of a pretty big downer....}
<A>__{as rocky gets level with him, frank lunges for him but lands inside the tank....because... rocky simultaneously abandons the chandelier, lands between magenta and columbia who now each have a pair of scissors with which they will snip his arm and leg bandages.}

<A>__{frank, in the tank behind rocky, puts his arms round rocky's neck. rocky spins away. magenta and columbia hang on to one end of his chest bandage so that it undoes as he goes.}
