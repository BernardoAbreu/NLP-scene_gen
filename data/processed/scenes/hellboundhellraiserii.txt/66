<L>__{interior shopping mall day}
<A>__{a large multi level shopping complex obviously up market and expensive. we see malahide, riding up one on the central escalators, looking around him as he does so, as if searching for a specific shop. he reaches the next level and begins to walk along one of the several avenues that lead away from the central square containing the escalators. he walks past several shops, looking in their windows; a chic specialty shop, a window full of clocks, a cutler's. finally, he stops in front of one. he stares at its display window. the window is classily minimal. there is in fact only one dress in it. it is an exquisite white cocktail gown. the gown is full length but quite tight fitting, merely flaring a little from below the knee, and has a halter neck. malahide walks into the shop.}
