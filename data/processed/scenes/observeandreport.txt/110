<L>__{interior mall night}
<A>__{the mall is basically empty as dennis and ronnie make the final rounds. they get to the doors and lock up for the night.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{dennis, i got to thank you for today. man, i was so down, but you taught me that i don't need to take things so seriously here. we have a pointless existence. who gives a fuck?}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{don't mention it, homey. i'm just glad i got me a partner in crime.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{a partner. i like that. you know, i've never really had a friend before, but i think that this could be the beginning of a real good thing.}
<A>__{dennis unlocks the doors to the gap.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{you ain't even seen the best part. after everybody leaves, i rob the shit out of this place.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{i steal shit!}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you're the one who's been robbing the mall?}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{hell yeah! who'd you think it was?!}
<A>__{dennis goes inside the gap and just starts grabbing shit.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i can't believe this. right in front of my goddamn face this whole time!}
<A>__{dennis holds up a sweat shirt.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{this probably will look good with my complexion.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{dennis, i can't take part in this.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{ronnie, i thought you were down?! what the fuck?! here i am opening up myself to you and you're just gonna stick it to me like this. what the fuck has this place ever done for you? don't you know that people see us as jokes?! a useless tool that's left in the shed. well that's not me. not now, not ever. i told you, i'm an outlaw.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i can't let you rob the mall.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{what the fuck you mean you can't let me?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{come on, dennis. we're best friends, so just put that stuff back and let's go get a beer.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{alright, ronnie, you're right.}
<A>__{dennis sets the shirts down.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{i don't really know what i was thinking. robbing the mall? let's just go get that beer.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{good, man. that makes me feel better.}
<A>__{ronnie turns to walk, but dennis grabs the hand of one of the mannequins and rips it off. he takes the hand and cracks ronnie over the head with it. ronnie goes down on his knees.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{see ya in mexico, bitch.}
<A>__{dennis cocks back and whacks ronnie again. ronnie's lights go out.}
