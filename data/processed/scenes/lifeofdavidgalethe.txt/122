<D>__{look at me. he's not your man. his name is dusty wright, deathwatch director before constance. he's a 'bullhorner,' a zealot who thinks a good demonstration has to end in a riot and arrests. 'almost martyrs don't mean shit.' they fired him. constance kept him in the organization, and he loved her for it. the man adored her.}
