<D>__{oh, never mind...}
<A>__{the janitor suddenly twitches, his eyes rolls up in his head. as he gasps his last castor heaves him down a stairwell. now we see the needle thin custom stiletto in castor's hand. castor kicks the janitor's mop and bucket down the stairs making everything look like an accident.}
