<L>__{exterior chapel, cold mountain town. 3 years earlier. day}
<A>__{a wooden joist swings across the view of the blue ridge. men are swarming over the roof of an unfinished chapel, below which appears the small town of cold mountain. among the workers, armed with nails and hammer, knees clutching a rafter, is inman, fresh and a whole lifetime younger. rourke and butcher are also there hammering, building, kidding around and oakley, barely a teenager. below them, women are setting up a lunch for the workers, ada amongst them. she has the circumspect air of the blue stocking, uncomfortably aware of the dirt beneath her hem, the men's radar for her every move. inman watches her as sally swanger approaches.}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(to ada, as monroe moves off)}
<D>__{ada, how are you settling in? are you liking the farm?}

<P>__{(pointing at inman}
<D>__{who immediately looks}
<P>__{away)}
<D>__{no. him in particular, up in the rafters. been pressing me all morning.}
<A>__{up on the roofbeams of the chapel, the men are preoccupied with talk of secession from the union.}
<C>__{rourke}
<P>__{(hammering)}
<D>__{i call this nail: northern aggression.}
<P>__{(hammering)}
<D>__{i call this nail: a free nigger.}

<D>__{show some respect these nails are making a church.}
<C>__{rourke}
<P>__{(hammering)}
<D>__{i call this nail: respect the church.}
<A>__{ada comes over, carrying a tray of lemonade glasses. calls up to inman.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{inman swings down. he feels the other men staring, burning a hole in his head.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{i'm ada monroe.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{i'm inman.}
<C>__{ada}

<C>__{ada}
<D>__{w. p. inman.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{repeating a thing doesn't improve it.}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{people call me inman.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{if you were to take a glass of lemonade your friends might stop staring. inman.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{they're not my friends.}
<A>__{he drops down to ground level, takes the lemonade, scowls at the other guys. they're breaking for lunch and as they make their way to the trestle tables they enjoy jostling inman.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{and what do you do?}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{i work wood. got a piece of land. mostly work wood.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{clear fields?}
<C>__{inman}
<P>__{(uncomfortable)}
<D>__{i can clear a field.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{so, was there something in particular you wished to say to me?}
<C>__{inman}
<P>__{(thinks about it)}
<D>__{not that comes to me.}
<P>__{(hands back the glass)}
<D>__{i will say thank you for the lemonade.}
<A>__{and he turns and joins the other men gathering round the tables for lunch. ada watches him, intrigued. rourke and co. approach esco swanger, a known sympathizer with the north, to give him a bad time.}
<C>__{rourke}
<D>__{esco loves the yankees.}
<C>__{esco}
<D>__{i prefer a yankee to a halfwit.}
<A>__{inman arrives just as rourke points a warning finger at esco. he pushes the finger down to get by. esco continues:}
<C>__{esco}
<D>__{what is it you think you'd be fighting for?}
<C>__{rourke}
<D>__{the south.}
<C>__{esco}
<D>__{and what's that when it's at home?}
<A>__{esco's sons, ellis and acton, who're working at the other end of the building, have now arrived at the table.}
<C>__{acton}
<D>__{pop, you causing trouble?}
<C>__{esco}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ellis}
<D>__{that means yes.}
<C>__{esco}
<D>__{you cut the wood, you carry the water for good old king cotton. now you want to fight for him. somebody has to explain it to me.}
<C>__{acton}
<P>__{(to rourke and the others)}
<D>__{don't even try.}
<A>__{the others are desperate to tease inman.}
<C>__{butcher}
<D>__{how's the lemonade? sweet?}
<A>__{ada, at the lemonade stand again, watches them laughing at inman, who keeps his head fixed on the table.}
