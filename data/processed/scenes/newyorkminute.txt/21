<B>__{action}
<A>__{parker steps outside where it's just as crowded. she scopes the situation, which isn't good stranded commuters jostle for the few remaining taxis. two executives get into a shoving match. to the left, a couple of black lincoln town cars standard car service rigs sit idling, each with a driver next to it, holding up his sign with his client's name scratched on it. an executive (#2) passes her, finger in the air, signaling the first driver who holds a sign that read: "wilcox."}
<D>__{executive #2 that's me.}
<A>__{with no further ado, the driver opens the back door for him, the exec climbs in, the driver hustles around to his side and in an instant, the car leaves the chaos behind. parker raises an eyebrow. hm. the second driver (bennie) with a head like a cinder block and no neck, is talking on his cell phone and holding up a sign, "scarpelli." parker shoots a finger into the air. this barely gets his attention but he nods, nonchalantly. parker signals again one minute then turns back inside.}
