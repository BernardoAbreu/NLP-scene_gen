<A>__{vivian is in the living room, pacing, edgy, the doorbell rings. she turns. it rings again. she opens it. stuckey is standing outside with a small briefcase. he looks agitated. he tries to hide it.}

<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{no, i will just have to wait then, won't i?}
<A>__{there is a bar set up. stuckey sets his briefcase down. he crosses to the bar.}
<C>__{stuckey }
<D>__{mind if i have a drink?}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{he pours liquor in a glass. he fires it down. it seems to calm him a bit.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{do you want to know what he did? do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did? he handed the whole thing back to kross! on a silver platter. for no reason! what was he thinking, i mean, what was going through his goddam head? why?}
<P>__{(pours another drink)}
<D>__{what was all that benevolent crap? what are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation? i will probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{i think it's great.}
<A>__{stuckey glares at vivian.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{i bet. a lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.}
<C>__{vivian}
<P>__{(mocking)}
<D>__{aw, come on, bill. it's just business.}
<A>__{he looks at her a moment.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{but what do i know, maybe you're worth it. come on, show me. let's see your act.}
<A>__{he grabs her wrist.}

<D>__{get out!}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{don't worry. i will pay for it. what a you charge? huh? twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, maybe? are you a fifty dollar whore?}
<A>__{he tries to kiss her and pulls her down on the couch on top of him.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{are you crazy?}
<A>__{she bites his hand. stuckey slaps her. vivian starts flailing back. but stuckey is too strong. vivian staggers back at the force of another slap. stuckey slams her up against a wall and starts rubbing up against her.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{you got a mean streak in you, don't you.}
<A>__{he tries to kiss her again.}
<C>__{stuckey }
<D>__{is that what he likes about you? huh? answer me!}
<A>__{and suddenly a hand lands on stuckey's shoulder. stuckey turns his head, startled.}
