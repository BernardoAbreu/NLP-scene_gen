<L>__{interior main doors night}
<A>__{the doorman sits beside the intercom board reading another harlequin nurse romance when he happens to glance up and notice the elevator flashers which indicate a stuck elevator. he sighs, shakes his head always something going wrong stuffs the pocketbook into his jacket, and gets up, taking out a huge ring of keys from his pocket as he does so. he walks over to the metal control panel sunk into the wall between the elevators and opens it with one of the keys on the ring. then, checking to make sure which elevator is the stuck one, he plays with a switch which manually overrides the floor selector and brings the elevator down. the doorman watches as the numbers show that the elevator is finally coming down. he stands by, waiting to see who or what has caused the elevator to stay at one floor for so long, jingling his keys, trying to look stern and authoritarian. the doors spring open. kurt stands at the back of the elevator, one arm around the young girl, who hugs him tightly. the girl is finishing the last bit of one of the crepes, sucking her fingers deliciously. the mother sits slumped in the opposite corner, her coat open, her dress torn, bruises on her face. she struggles to her feet. kurt and the girl are ignoring her. the doorman is nonplussed. he hesitates, then makes a move toward the elevator, intending to help the woman to her feet.}
