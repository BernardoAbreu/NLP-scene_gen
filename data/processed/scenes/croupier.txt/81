<L>__{interior sitting room night}
<A>__{jack comes in from the bedroom. marion says nothing. she puts the typescript down. jack waits. marion gets off the sofa.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i don't like it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i don't like it at all. you had a wonderful character before, the gambler. he was so romantic.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he was a loser. this guy's a croupier. he can't lose. people have shat on him all his life. now he's in control. he's a winner.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{is that your idea of a winner? he doesn't give a shit about anyone. he uses people and }
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{ it's because of the sex, isn't it? you don't like the sex in it.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i don't give a fuck about the sex. most men'll fuck a lamppost. he's just a miserable zombie. is that the way you feel now? is that what's happened to you?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{marion. it's a book.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{oh really. then why is he called jake. why don't you come clean and call him jack.}
<P>__{(softens)}
<D>__{there's no hope in it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's the truth.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{without hope there's no point to anything.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{now wait a minute. what's so hopeful about your job? spending the day catching poor people stealing. you said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. at least in the casino everybody gets caught. rich or poor, the odds are the same. it's all relative.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{crap. it's not relative. it's unfair. like your casino. it's designed unfair. and your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.}
<A>__{jack sees marion is getting really angry. he crosses the room, pointedly takes marion's handbag, opens it, takes out a national lottery card and receipt. the doorbell rings.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{you're just like all those other dummies out there. fourteen and a half million to one! is that your idea of hope?}
<A>__{the doorbell rings again.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{the door, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{leave it.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{no. answer it!}
<A>__{jack hands her the lottery card and goes to the door, opens it. bella stands there.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{you fucking little shit! you shopped me.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<A>__{marion watches, numb.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{reynolds got a doctor in. they forced me to take a dope test. it was positive. as you knew.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't know anything about it.}
<A>__{bella looks over to marion.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. what do you think of that? i can't get a job now.}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{you bastard. you're no different from matt. a pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{look bella, i don't know anything about this. you should talk to matt.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{you're all scumbags.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i agree.}
<A>__{without looking at marion, bella suddenly kisses jack on the lips. bella looks hard at jack, then leaves. jack pursues her.}
