<L>__{interior cave}
<A>__{the light glows just around the next corner... the children run after it, slipping in the mud, laughing, turning the corner... and the light glows just around the next corner. they scramble, they slip and slide, they can't catch the light, but they're all having the time of their lives. bloom included. holding the girl's hand, laughing, eyes full of wonder.}

<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{the children's parents, less so.}
<A>__{the foster parents exchange a glance. quick shots stephen is smacked. the wad of money is snatched from a grubby small hand by an angry big one. a telephone slams down. on a form, the field "reason for return:" is filled with "larceny."}

<A>__{the owner of the voice, a man a bit younger than charleston in a derby cap, snatches the gun away and slaps charleston hard.}
<C>__{charleston}
<D>__{cause the turk was right. after seeing her, after that night on the airstrip, after cairo everything changed, and he couldn't see the play through that one milky eye, but the turk was right about one thing, that there's nothing beautiful about money. she's beautiful.}
<C>__{mcguire}
<D>__{this isn't happening...}
<C>__{charleston}
<D>__{he'll never have her now. she's free. and i will never see her in scarlet again, her chestnut hair, but it's worth the money and my job and his life and the rest of my life that she's free.}

<D>__{wow.}
<A>__{he pats victor, who sits up, spitting blood. mcguire looks to victor and the woman for a reaction. gets none.}

<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{what else did he tell you?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i'm not going to tell it as good as stephen. you two kicked around till your early teens, then stowed away on a merchant marine freighter and ended up in st. petersburg, where you spent five years under the tutelage of a shadowy old swindler named the diamond dog. and he was your fagin and stephen was his artful dodger, but it ended suddenly and badly.}

<D>__{well it's funny how everyone's usually got one.}
<A>__{as penelope tells her story she gets fancier with her shuffles.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{when i turned six i started getting allergies, hayfever, rashes, really bad. so my mom took me into the doctor, and he did that test where they use needles to prick a grid on your back with all the different toxins, to see which ones you're allergic to. the next day i came in, the doctor lifted up my shirt, and my back looked like a patch of oily, moldy, blackish green double puff marshmallows. i was allergic to everything. so they sealed the house with plastic and a special ventilation system, and i spent my entire childhood and adolescence indoors. mostly alone. lonely.}
<A>__{she pulls the queens out of the deck and lays them face up on the table.}

<D>__{wow.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{it wasn't `til i was nineteen they discovered what i was actually allergic to was the aluminum alloy the hypodermic needle was made out of. then i was going to leave, but my mom got sick. so i stayed. and she stayed sick, a long time.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{do you feel cheated?}
<A>__{penelope does an amazing card trick using the four queens.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{the trick to not feeling cheated is to learn how to cheat. so i decided this wasn't a story about a miserable girl trapped in a house that smelled like medical supplies wasting her life on a dying person she sometimes hated. it was about a girl who could find infinite beauty in anything, any little thing. and do anything she decided to do. and love the person she was trapped with. so i told myself that story until it became true. now did doing that let me escape a wasted life, or did it just blind me so i wouldn't want to escape it? i don't know. but either way, i was the one telling my own story. so i don't feel cheated.}
<A>__{she finishes the trick. a single pair of hands clapping turns their heads. at the far end of the deck, alone at a table, the large man in the fur collared cape, who for reasons unlikely to become clear at the moment will be called the curator.}

<A>__{he hands her a single blood red rose. she puts it in her teeth, and they dance. if there is a tinge of tension in the air, the bolero suits it. the moon ducks behind a cloud once more, and they dance on in the dark.}

<P>__{(glances at the curator)}
<D>__{soon.}
<A>__{they go, leaving bloom and penelope, who squints at an unframed oil on canvas, of a lonely stone well in a primeval forest clearing. it sits at the foot of an unmade bed.}
<C>__{the curator}
<D>__{from a private collection on the island of ikaria. that one.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{who painted it?}
<C>__{the curator}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{why is it the last thing you see every night, and the first thing you see every morning?}
<C>__{the curator}
<D>__{that's a story. you have a minute?}
<A>__{he closes the blinds and sits on a stool in front of the painting. setting the stage.}
<C>__{the curator }
<D>__{my daughter travelled with me when she was very young, and i'd show her the places and the art, all the most joyous and terrifying things in the world.}
<A>__{memories of his daughter's hand in his, flashing against the sun.}
<D>__{the curator (cont'd) (cont'd) i wanted that the world was alive in the most fantastic way for her. to built her a pair of wings. make these things real. but maybe more than any other objet d'art, she loved to hear she'd ask to hear the story of the stone golem. from a painting in a small private collection on the island of ikaria.}
<A>__{he motions to the painting, and we move into it. as he tells the story the scenes are shown in the painting, just as still images, which we move across like a picture book.}
<D>__{the curator (cont'd) (cont'd) well rachel, like most monsters the golem was once a human. a boy, about your age. the curator (cont'd) (cont'd) and one day the boy was walking home, and he quarrelled, he fought, with a good friend of his. they got very angry and his friend pushed him a certain way and the boy fell and struck his head and died. the boy's friend was very sad but also very frightened. so instead of telling the boy's parents, he did something awful. he pulled the body into a quarry, a pit of broken rocks, and hid the boy beneath a pile of large stones. well. years went by, and the boy's friend became a young man, and one day while drinking in town (which}
<P>__{in his guilt he did quite a lot of)}
<D>__{he heard that a well was being built near the forest... with the stones from the quarry. he ran to the quarry to find it nearly empty... no stones, no body. he ran to the well where the masons were finishing their work. `did they find anything strange in the quarry?' he asked, expecting, maybe hoping they'd arrest him for the awful crime on the spot. but no, they said, motioning to the well. nothing strange. just stones. they left him alone there at the well, and he stood looking into it as the sun fell behind the mountains and twilight set the world in a deep, still silence.}
<A>__{the last image we land on is the well, alone in the clearing. its dark innards loom ominously in the long pregnant silence that follows. then, with a piercing roar, a living monster of stone lunges out of the well, animated and terrifying, grabs the friend by the throat and with a crunching of bones and one last roar pulls him back down into the depths of the well. silence again. we pull out of the painting, back to the curator, sitting very still.}
<C>__{the curator }
<D>__{my daughter died nineteen years ago today. she was six. she went out to play one afternoon and vanished.}
<C>__{the curator }
<D>__{the next morning we found her, in a stone well on a neighboring property. i climbed down to her, but slipped and broke my leg, and while we waited for the rescue team to pull us out she died in my arms. if you've had a child... my whole everything just focused down to one thing, to hold her and make her feel safe. but no matter what i said to her, i couldn't stop her shaking, crying. her last moments on this earth were filled with terror. of a stone golem.}
<A>__{he stands, opens the blinds, pours another drink.}
<C>__{the curator }
<D>__{it was the first painting i `acquired.' i keep it maybe hoping some night the golem will come for me.}

<D>__{it is you i do business with, yes?}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{right. oh, right.}
<A>__{she gives him the envelope with the certified check. he shakes her hand, then deftly adjusts his grip so that just for a moment he holds her hand as you would hold a child's. he lets go, and smiles apologetically.}

<A>__{the dog plays with a heavy gold lighter, making sparks.}
<C>__{diamond dog }
<D>__{it's been a funny thing, watching you boys take what i taught you and eclipse me. i'm so proud to be a footnote in the lives of the brothers bloom. and you hate me. the curse of all bad fathers that my presence on this earth after i die will not live on the lips of admiring men, but will sink into the murky backwaters of my children's psyches.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{is this profundity? cause you can skip it.}
<C>__{diamond dog}
<D>__{ha! ha ha. piss and vinegar.}
<A>__{the dog scoots next to bloom.}
<C>__{diamond dog }
<D>__{when i first took you boys in, showed you the ropes, haunting st. pete's, piss and vinegar. i still crave that youthful joy. even today.}
<A>__{the dog's hand touches bloom's leg. there is something horrible about this. beneath the bar, bloom grips the sharp pencil like a knife.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{don't touch me.}
<C>__{diamond dog}
<D>__{you probably won't believe i loved you boys very much.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{you're going to take your hand away or i'm going to break your arm, there's nothing between.}
<A>__{he does, but bloom's fingers don't loosen on the pencil.}
<C>__{diamond dog}
<D>__{but love, you know. we know, folks like us, you can always blink and realize that it's a fiction, and like peter walking on water or wiley coyote running off a cliff, if you look down in doubt you'll fall. that's the price of our lives, the wax in our wings. one day stephen's going to fall. it may be glorious, but he's going to fall hard and he won't be there to tell you what to do and protect you. when he's gone, remember me.}
<A>__{the dog has moved in very close to bloom, his breath hot on his face, and his hand comes to rest fully on bloom's leg. bloom's hand with the pencil quivers, about to strike when bloom is pulled from the bar stool by a heavy hand. stephen, his eyes burning through the dog.}
<C>__{diamond dog }
<D>__{hello stephen.}
<A>__{stephen smashes a bottle from the bar and slashes it across the dog's hand. waiters and porters tackle him, the dog howls, holding his bleeding hand. bloom stands numb, and puts the pencil in his pocket.}

<D>__{thanks.}

<D>__{no!}
<A>__{bloom's revolver pops out of his sleeve and he's firing into the blackness. stephen drops flat to the ground. the fiery rapport of a big pistol flashes from the blackness, strobing the scene like stage lightning. bloom reloads behind the cover of a heavy flat, but stephen lies on his stomach out in the open.}
<C>__{bloom }
<D>__{stephen!}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{stay back!}
<A>__{but bloom makes a dash for his brother, out into the open, unloading three more rounds into the dark. the dark figure returns fire on bloom, who is sprinting full on his feet in a large pool of light. a sitting duck. stephen launches himself up, tackling bloom backwards. just before they fall behind the safety of the flat, a red burst of blood flowers from stephen's left lower back. bloom sets him down gently, and hears heavy footsteps behind him. he turns, firing, but only sees a blur of dark coat go by, through the torn backdrop. bloom runs out on stage, tearing the tarpaulin, and fires after the dark figure limping up the aisle and away into the lobby. silence. bloom walks back to stephen, who lies behind the flat, breathing heavy. blood soaking through his shirt.}

<D>__{please tell me this is all gonna be ok. tell me that's a squib, and that's makeup, and that you just gave me what i always wanted and pulled off the perfect con.}
