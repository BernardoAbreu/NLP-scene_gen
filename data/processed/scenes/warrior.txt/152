<A>__{tommy continues to batter brendan, then he swoops in, picks him up, and slams his big brother into the ground. then he does it again. and again. and again. brendan, the wind knocked out of him, is on his back, trying to protect himself from tommy, who mounts him and starts blasting away with a blur of lefts and rights. the only thing that saves brendan is the horn. which tommy ignores, blasting his brother with a brutal cheap shot to the jaw well after the round had ended.}
