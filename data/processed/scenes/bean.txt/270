<A>__{bean sitting in the wedged car. he tries the door but it won't open a centimetre. he's totally stuck. he looks up at a small window in the roof. if only he could get that open. he pushes various buttons, which set of windscreen wipers, squirters, radios. he pushes the cigarette lighter. finally, he pulls a lever and the bonnet pops up an inch. at which moment we see the lighter shoot out, and on to the seat. bean is still looking round below the dashboard, when he notices a little fire in the seat beside him. not good news. bean panics a bit, turns and half climbs over into the back seat, when he spies a drinks cabinet. he has a very good idea he finds a cut crystal decanter of brown liquid, opens it and uses it to douse the fire. not a wise move with brandy. before the cut, we see the whooosh! of a major fire in the front seat of the car.}
