<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{i think that's about it for business. but on a personal note, be advised that, ah, none of you can sing worth a damn.}
<A>__{laughter in the mmcr.}

<B>__{kirov}
<A>__{flips a switch on the radar gun, then swivels its muzzle slowly across the near slope of the mountain. we hear and feel the radar signal. the immediate result is that the pulsing tone we've been hearing suddenly stops.}
<B>__{luke}
<A>__{looks up from the display screen. a puzzled expression.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{why did that stop?}
<A>__{a split second later, he gets his answer. we hear a whoosh, a mighty rushing of wind, as a gigantic, translucent cylinder starts to swirl and rise, straight up from the top or the mountain, at its center. as it swirls, the cylinder picks up debris pebbles, sand from the sediment encrusted surface of the slopes.}
<B>__{the four astronauts}
<A>__{stare up at this spectacle, awed. a cyclone? some kind of energy wave? they have no idea. at the moment they're too fascinated to even be scared. tilting up from their pov we see the whirling cylinder rise, higher and higher, perfectly straight, until in just moments it's as tall as a skyscraper. as it rises, it gains speed and power, narrowing at its top into a conical vortex. it's sucking up so much dirt, so many rocks even small boulders now that the accumulating debris begins to darken its swirling, translucent outer "skin".}
<B>__{the astronauts}
<A>__{exchange amazed glances. can't believe their eyes...}
