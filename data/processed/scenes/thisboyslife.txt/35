<L>__{exterior small bridge day}
<A>__{the three stand by the edge of the bridge, looking down into the water. they see salmon fighting the last few yards of their yearly battle to spawn. against the rapid current, they leap again and again. long strips of flesh hang from their bodies.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{they always show you salmon fighting to get upstream, but they never show you what they look like when they get there.}
<A>__{her face strained, caroline leans over for a closer look. the salmon swim in slow, stunned circles, some with an eye missing or hanging by a membrane, a hideous sight.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{it's pitiful. awful.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{they'll spawn, and then they'll die. they're dying now.}
<A>__{as toby and caroline move to the passenger side of the car, toby speaks so dwight can't hear:}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i hope to hell it's not an omen.}
<A>__{caroline has to fight back a smile.}
