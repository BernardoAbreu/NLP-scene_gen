<A>__{salander browses through an iphoto album of old photographs of blomkvist and the motorcycle he mentioned. in some of them, erika is with him. in all of them, he's wearing a leather jacket not unlike salander's.}
<D>__{blomkvist o s what are you doing?}
<A>__{he's just woken up in a tangle of blankets on the couch to see her at his laptop. she closes the album, leaving on the screen what she was looking at before: his imovie of the parade and some annotated police files.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{going over your notes.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{they're encrypted.}
<A>__{she gives him a don't be a child look.}

<D>__{have some coffee.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i will. and then we'll have a talk about what's yours and what's mine.}
<A>__{blomkvist drags himself up, pours himself some coffee, adds some milk.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{it's amazing what you figured out from the parade photos.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{too bad you don't have hers.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{whose.}
<A>__{she doesn't say. he comes over. she plays the imovie, stops on a frame before harriet turns her head. points to a young couple standing among the people behind her. the woman has an instamatic camera in her hand.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{her.}
<A>__{she advances to the next frame: the woman has raised the camera to her eye. and the next: harriet turning her head in foreground while in the background the flash cube atop the woman's instamatic flares slightly. blomkvist is stunned, by both the fact he didn't notice it before, and what it means: though the woman is taking a snapshot of the parade, she could have inadvertently included in it whatever whoever harriet saw at that moment across the street.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{he takes over his laptop from her, finds the later courier photos he didn't include in his imovie, after harriet has left. in one, the couple is moving off the other way. in another, they're getting in a parked car to leave. he sharpens the photoshop contrast. the rear license plate is partly visible, but too small for him to make out even by squinting.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{can you read that?}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{a, c, three the rest is blocked.}
<A>__{he focuses on a decal on the car's back window. the letters are even small and blurrier, but she thinks she can make out }

<C>__{salander}
<D>__{too small to read.}
<A>__{he gets up. heads for the front door to smoke his cigarette outside }
<C>__{blomkvist }
<D>__{i'm going to have to go to norsjo.}
<A>__{he opens the door to leave and sees on the porch the charred corpse of the cat. its legs sawn off and arranged in the shape of a swastika lie in the middle of a dark circle of blood. he seems too startled to move, but when salander sees it, she immediately gets her camera and begins framing close ups of the cat parts, and its head resting atop the seat of her motorcycle. blomkvist stares off at harald's house ...}
