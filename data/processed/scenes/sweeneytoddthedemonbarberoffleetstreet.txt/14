<D>__{of course, when she goes there, poor thing, poor thing, they're having this ball all in masks.}
<A>__{lucy wanders lost through the swirling dancers, they buffet her, confusing her...}
<C>__{mrs. lovett }
<D>__{there's no one she knows there, poor dear, poor thing, she wanders tormented, and drinks, poor thing. the judge has repented, she thinks, poor thing. "oh, where is judge turpin?" she asks.}
<A>__{the beadle finds lucy again and graciously gives her his arm, leading her through the party. she is thankful for the salvation he provides. he brings her to judge turpin. the judge descends on lucy, raping her. the other guests crowd around ravenously, enjoying the spectacle. a feverish nightmare.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett }
<D>__{he was there, all right only not so contrite! she wasn't no match for such craft, you see, and everyone thought it so droll. they figured she had to be daft, you see, so all of `em stood there and laughed, you see, poor soul! poor thing!}
