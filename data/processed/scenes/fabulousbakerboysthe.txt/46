<A>__{jack paces outside the veterinary clinic, rubbing his arms against the night's chill. he glances up at the flickering sign over the building: "twenty four hour emergency care." inside, a kid with deep set eyes is bent over a magazine. jack hesitates then enters.}

<A>__{jack glances around, ill at ease.}
<C>__{kid}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you want something, pal? if you're looking for a bathroom, try the super chief around the corner.}
<A>__{the kid goes back to his magazine.}

<D>__{you can check in on him tomorrow. between eight and five.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah, well, couldn't i take a look now?}
<A>__{the kid looks up at jack with mild contempt.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{you want to know if he's okay. right?}

<D>__{black. labrador.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{all right. they lay the dead ones out in the cold room. i will take a look.}
<A>__{the kid disappears into the back. jack stands frozen, watching the swinging door come to rest. he looks like a man who, unexpectedly, finds a razor pressed to his neck. he fumbles for a cigarette, but doesn't light it. he waits. a moment later, the door swings open.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{nope. just a couple poodles.}
<A>__{jack nods, then, moving stiffly, leaves.}
