<L>__{interior interrogation room seattle police department}
<A>__{a small, cold room with a large mirror along the west wall. gina sits at the table, shivering. her breath visible, so are her nipples through a white, seattle p.d. t shirt. conners paces around her like a circling shark. dekker's in the corner, observing.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{we found the money.}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{that money was dwayne's...}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{that money came from our evidence room.}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{i told you. i don't know nothing about a bank robbery. whatever damon was into, i didn't know!}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{so, where were you going?}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{vacation.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{this isn't possession or solicitation, gina. this is felony murder one. you could get life.}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{me!? i didn't do nothing!}
<C>__{conners}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{it's "i didn't do anything." "didn't do nothing" is a double negative, infers the positive. the grammar in this country sucks.}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{then i didn't do any thing!}
<A>__{conners takes a seat next to gina. his eyes burn through her.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{this isn't going away. you want to walk out of here, you tell me something... now.}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{i swear i don't know. now i'm done talking. i want a lawyer.}
<A>__{dekker lowers his head. disappointed.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{you sure that's what you want?}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{fine. then it's two phone calls i will make. the first will be to the public defender's office. the second to children's services.}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{suddenly gina's bravado disappears. suddenly a scared and lonely girl.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{it's simple... if you insist on a lawyer, i take your kids.}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{not like you cared about them anyway. you were ready to fly the coop with "shit for brains."}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{no. you can't do that.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{i can and i will.}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{don't.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{tell me what i want to know!}
<A>__{dekker stares incredulously at conners.}
<C>__{gina}
<P>__{(broken)}
<D>__{i don't know anything. please don't take my kids. please.}
<A>__{conners stares into gina's eyes. she's telling the truth. conners wraps his coat around gina's shoulders.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{get her some coffee... something hot.}
