<L>__{interior spaulding's day}
<A>__{the door swings open. wydell enters slowly, putting on his best cowboy attitude. naish follows suit. wydell, hands on his belt, struts up to the counter. no one is around. a rusted bell sits on the counter, taped to it is a handwritten note, "ring for service". wydell rings it once, waits, no response. rings it again, waits, no response.}
<C>__{naish}
<P>__{(looking around the room)}
<D>__{get a load of all this crap... this is one sick place.}
<A>__{wydell begins ringing the bell non stop. spaulding shouts from the backroom.}
<C>__{capt. spaulding}
<D>__{whoever's a jerking off on that bell better be gone when i get out there... 'cause i'm gonna rip your nuts off.}
<A>__{spaulding enters from behind the curtain, angry. he sees the troopers and puts on a phony grin.}
<C>__{capt. spaulding}
<D>__{officers, officers what can i do for you today? i ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.}
<C>__{wydell}
<P>__{(pulls a paper from his pocket)}
<D>__{what i need are some answers.}
<P>__{(unfolds the paper to}
<D>__{reveal a picture of}
<P>__{denise)}
<C>__{capt. spaulding}
<D>__{well, i will try but i don't know nothing 'bout nobody. i'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what i'm saying.}
<C>__{wydell}
<P>__{(holds up picture)}
<D>__{you seen this girl? say... within the last 24 hours.}
<A>__{spaulding reaches out and grabs the picture.}
<C>__{capt. spaulding}
<P>__{(studies the picture)}
<D>__{yeah, yeah i seen her. good looking kid, but not really my type...}
<P>__{(gesturing with his hands)}
<D>__{...i like meaty, eh?}
<C>__{naish}
<P>__{(losing patience)}
<D>__{hey ass clown, how 'bout some answers. he ain't interested in your love life.}
<C>__{wydell}
<D>__{come on, get with the facts.}
<C>__{capt. spaulding}
<D>__{hmmmmmmmmm?}
<C>__{wydell}
<D>__{what'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?}
<C>__{capt. spaulding}
<D>__{aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high rise kids. they were poking around... asking stupid questions.}
<C>__{naish}
<D>__{questions about what?}
<C>__{capt. spaulding}
<D>__{this and that, mostly some tired dr. satan bullshit... they got a gander at the display back there and thought they could solve the great deadwoods mystery.}
<C>__{wydell}
<D>__{and...}
<C>__{capt. spaulding}
<D>__{and i gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... i figured what's the harm. stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.}
<C>__{wydell}
<D>__{is that all... think real hard.}
<C>__{capt. spaulding}
<D>__{yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as i do with most of the assholes that wander through here.}
<C>__{wydell}
<D>__{how's about you give me those same directions.}
<C>__{capt. spaulding}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, sure. you don't have to get all true grit all over my ass... i will give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all i care.}
<C>__{wydell}
<P>__{(hands him a note pad)}
<D>__{enough talk, write.}
