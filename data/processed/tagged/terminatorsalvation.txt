<L>__{interior death row cell dawn}
<A>__{start tight on marcus wright. he's an intense, powerful man,}
<L>__{20's 30's, his head shaven. marcus stares into camera with a}
<A>__{resigned expression. we hear the voice of a priest:}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{yea, though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death, i will fear no evil: for thou art beside me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me...}
<A>__{camera pulls back, straight up. marcus lies in his cot, staring at the ceiling. he's smoking a cigarette. this overhead angle reveals a priest with a bible, in a folding chair beside him. a chess set, stacks of books, writing materials in the cell. two guards wait, shackles in hand. marcus has no interest in scripture. he blows a cloud of smoke which drifts in the direction of the priest, who blinks and shuts his bible. one of the guards unlocks the cell door for dr. serena kogan. she's in her 30's 50's, brilliant, attractive, but thin and pale, a scarf tied around her head. she carries a clipboard. the priest backs off to give her some privacy with marcus.}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{marcus i'm doctor serena kogan, i'm with project angel. you consented to donate your body to science...}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{yeah, i'm pretty much done with it.}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{you've been chosen for our research.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{chosen? lucky me.}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{we just need a couple of signatures...}
<A>__{marcus sits up, she passes him the clipboard and pen he notes that her hands are shaking.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you don't need to be scared.}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{i'm not. it's nerve degeneration.}
<A>__{marcus looks up from the form, takes in the scarf covering her sparse hair.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{cancer?}
<C>__{serena}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{you're not the only one with a death sentence.}
<A>__{marcus meets her eyes. she studies him a beat.}
<C>__{serena }
<D>__{what you're doing is important, marcus. our work is still highly experimental... but you may be helping people in ways you can't begin to imagine.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i'm a regular hero.}
<A>__{with that sarcastic comment, he signs his name we see the words "project angel" at the top of dense type on the form. serena takes the clipboard, starts to rise. she touches his hand for a moment.}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{thank you. and... i'm sorry.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{no one lives forever.}
<A>__{the guard sees serena out.}
<L>__{interior death row corridor night}
<A>__{low angle marcus' chained ankles clank as the guards lead him down the corridor, past prisoners in their cells; some avert their eyes, others give a nod or raise a fist.}
<C>__{priest }
<D>__{marcus, this is your last opportunity to make a confession...}
<A>__{marcus stares straight ahead, taking deep, steady breaths, struggling not to succumb to fear.}
<D>__{priest (v.o.) (cont'd) is there nothing you would say to officer martinez' family?}
<L>__{interior death row execution chamber night}
<A>__{close buckles tighten... an alcohol swab on marcus' forearm... a needle punctures his skin.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{what can i say. i was seventeen, i was angry, i was stupid.}
<A>__{fingers turn the valve to release the lethal chemicals. close on marcus' eyes, looking up toward the deadly i.v., running into his arm. from this, he looks toward his reflection in a one way mirror, the dim shapes of witnesses beyond.}
<D>__{marcus (v.o.) (cont'd) yeah... i'm sorry about it. i'm sorry about everything. the whole goddamn world...}
<A>__{as the lethal injection takes hold, his pov moves to bright lights overhead, losing focus and bleaching to white... from the white screen, a face emerges, backlit, blurred it's serena. she's in focus for just a moment, leaning into camera then moves out of frame.}

<L>__{exterior cornfield dusk}
<A>__{cornstalks as far as the eye can see, rustling in a summer breeze. figures are moving within the field. we only make them out in silhouette, but all carry heavy rifles.}

<A>__{a computer targeting screen the figures are highlighted in this tactical display, as is an octagonal hatch into the ground beneath the corn.}
<L>__{exterior cornfield dusk}
<A>__{the figures in the corn look up we hear an aircraft approach with a jet whine fwoom! a massive concussion as a bunker busting missile bores into the earth at high velocity, burrowing deep then a huge blast flame and dirt are thrown high in the air, many of the figures blown sky high. a flaming body hits the ground in fg, face to camera... we now see it was a steel terminator its metal skull blown open and scorched, its red eyes shattered. a 10 warthogs stubby attack planes scream from the sky, raking the remaining figures with cannon fire, blasting them to bits. these aircraft no longer bear traditional u.s. insignia they're painted in wild colors, graffiti lettering says things like: "bot blaster," "kill for connor," "rage against the machines," etc... resistance fighters. motley military and civilian choppers land in the cornfield, disgorging resistance soldiers. these are human troops in high tech helmets, carrying slightly futuristic conventional}
<B>__{assault weapons.}
<A>__{the warthogs veer off, laying napalm in the distance behind the soldiers. the troops run toward an opening which has been blown into the ground, the remains of the octagonal hatch where the bunker buster hit. a surviving terminator rises from the singed corn, fires its plasma rifle dropping a soldier. his comrades fire explosive bullets and blow the robot apart. the leader of this assault group waves his soldiers to enter the dark hatchway.}
<L>__{interior underground facility corridor night}
<A>__{collapsed ceilings, flames, a high tech installation in ruins; red lighting, distinctive of skynet environments. soldiers flick on helmet lamps and make their way carefully inside pretty deserted. they kick aside rubble to enter }
<L>__{interior underground facility robotic room night}
<A>__{helmet beams play over banks of electronics and a dozen fixed, industrial robots not remotely humanoid engaged in mysterious tasks, mechanical arms at work. the soldiers rake the room with gunfire machinery collapses, sparks from exploding circuitry.}

<C>__{team leader}
<D>__{clear!}
<A>__{soldiers move from cover and through the blown door.}
<L>__{interior underground facility storage room night}
<A>__{tubes and fiber optic cables run into dozens of glass cylinders filled with translucent pink liquid. the soldiers make their way in, alert but nothing's moving in here. the team leader peers into a cylinder, aims his headlamp at a small mass of tissue floating inside, connected to a dense network of fiber optic cables... it's a human brain.}
<C>__{team leader}
<D>__{oh god.}
<A>__{the team leader recoils but before he can say more, the room shakes with a deafening roar.}
<L>__{exterior cornfield night}
<A>__{a huge escape ship rises straight up from an open hatchway. nearby troops crouch and fire after it. the ship pivots in mid air and roars off, soldiers dodging the engine blast.}
<L>__{interior underground facility storage room night}
<A>__{the team leader speaks into his headset. the other soldiers inspect the many cylinders, react in horror and shock.}
<C>__{team leader}
<D>__{you will not believe the shit we found down here }
<A>__{as he speaks, camera finds a green led on the ceiling which suddenly flashes red and blinks rapidly }
<L>__{exterior cornfield night}

<D>__{ repeat, that was not us! a ship escaped, they musta blown the place themselves! jesus, a lot of our guys were still down there...}

<B>__{raindrops.}
<A>__{months have passed, the season changed corn long dead, a black stubble. rain falls. a patch of mud stirs something below is moving. the mud roils, seeming to assume a human shape... eyes open, looking around in shock, the naked figure is so drenched in mud we can't recognize it at first. the figure rises, looks up at the sky, and falling rain washes away mud from his face... it's marcus wright. he opens his mouth, makes a few guttural noises... then screams. camera pulls up from marcus' agonized face...}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior plateau evening}
<A>__{bare feet trudge through the dirt. marcus moves along a slight rise, wrapped in torn and filthy rags, mud caked on his body. eerie silence. reaching the edge of a rise, he sees in the distance a decimated city, buildings collapsed into rubble.}
<L>__{exterior dead city night}
<A>__{moonlight. the skeleton of a large dog lies on the ground, partially covered by a dusting of snow. it still bears a rotting collar attached to a chain. move to a chain link fence, partially collapsed, a singed, faded sign: "beware of dog." wider, we're in the low rent district of this city in ruins rubble, random walls still stand. hulks of cars, rusted, windowless. it's been over a decade since the bombs fell. marcus is the only thing alive here. he moves down this block, picks up a handful of snow, brings it to his lips. a collapsed newsstand. marcus walks past the racks, picks up a magazine which crumbles in his hands. a human skeleton, clothes in tatters, is half buried behind the collapsed counter. there's a bulge in its shirt pocket. marcus gingerly reaches into the pocket and fishes out a cellophane wrapped pack of cigarettes and a butane lighter. marcus sits on a piece of rubble by the skeleton. he tears open the packet and puts a dried out, stale cigarette to his lips, tries the lighter a few times, finally gets a flame. he lights the cig, inhales deeply he waits for a rush, feels nothing. he takes a few more drags, increasingly disappointed, then flicks the cigarette away. he rises, looks toward a caved in storefront, makes out a clothing store's tattered sign on the ground, amidst broken glass: "sale! going out of business! everything must go!"}
<L>__{interior ruined clothing store night}
<A>__{fallen racks, clothes and shoes covered in years of dust and rubble. marcus, grateful to be rid of the rags, has pulled on jeans and sneakers, using the cigarette lighter for illumination. he kicks away some fallen ceiling tiles from a rack of army jackets. he holds one up looks good.}
<L>__{interior ruined bar night}
<A>__{partially collapsed, a downscale watering hole. broken stools, booths, a dead pinball machine. marcus, dressed now, again using the lighter to find his way, sorts through the broken glass and rubble behind the bar, comes up with }
<B>__{a dusty bottle of whisky.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{hallelujah.}
<A>__{he unscrews the cap, raises the bottle to a skeleton on the floor nearby. marcus takes a long pull and chokes, instantly dizzy. he sinks to the floor, passing out.}
<T>__{cut to black:}
<A>__{memory montage: quick, fragmentary, impressionistic povs, blurred, altered. sfx of heartbeats, a respirator. webs of tubes and fiber optics fills the frame. grids of laser light scan rapidly into camera. digital displays blink through murky liquid. serena moves}
<L>__{into frame, a look of concentration on her face as she peers}
<A>__{through the liquid, into camera. she starts to smile.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior dead city day}
<A>__{blue sky. tilt down to find marcus, who plods on through the dead city's outskirts. he pauses near a collapsed bus kiosk. a smiling woman stares out at him from a faded advertisement. marcus studies the woman. she's nothing like serena, but her expression recalls the beckoning vision. he runs his hand over the image of her face, pulls away a chunk of cracked, graffitied glass over the poster. then he carefully tears the poster to remove the woman's face, folds the paper, slips it in a pocket and continues on.}
<L>__{exterior highway night}
<A>__{deserted, car hulks about, crumbling skeletons at the wheels. marcus moves down the center of the freeway on this moonlit night, paying little attention to anything around him. we're in mostly flat, treeless plains. from the opposite direction, figures approach, moving through the darkness. marcus hurries excitedly toward them, the first living creatures he's seen. he waves.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{hey! yo, over here!}
<A>__{the figures pause, turning toward him in unison.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{damn it's good to see you guys, i felt like i was the last man on...}
<A>__{he freezes in his tracks. these aren't humans. they're t }
<L>__{400s plastic skinned terminators armed with plasma}
<A>__{rifles. they wear a motley collection of found clothing, but their male humanoid faces are identical, unnatural and motionless, like masks. their eyes flicker red as they scan him.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{oh god...}
<A>__{marcus backs away, runs. the t 400s stare after him but don't fire. angle through binocular mask marcus running for all he's worth, heading toward the viewer. we hear a muttering voice:}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{hey mister, where you goin' in such a hurry?}
<A>__{angle on a boy, scrawny and filthy, in his early to mid teens. he crouches on the supports of a freeway sign. he wears layers of tattered, over sized clothing. he scrambles quickly down from the sign. at an off ramp, marcus' pace slows as he moves to get off the freeway, when the boy emerges from behind some rubble, holding a handgun in one hand, a lit oil lantern in the other.}
<C>__{boy }
<D>__{whoah, whoah hang on there. got any food?}
<A>__{marcus raises his hands, shakes his head. the boy looks him over dubiously.}
<C>__{boy }
<D>__{you look like you been eating pretty good.}
<A>__{the boy moves closer, puts down the lantern, frisks marcus with one hand while holding the gun on him with the other.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you're human... you can see me, you can touch me. this place is real.}
<A>__{the boy makes a dubious face, yanks a handful of paper scraps from marcus' pocket.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{i thought i was in hell.}
<C>__{boy}
<P>__{(raises an eyebrow)}
<D>__{this sure ain't heaven.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{those things with masks, red eyes }
<C>__{boy}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{terminators t 400s. what is this stuff?}
<A>__{the boy unfolds the paper scraps in the lantern light angle on paper scraps the woman's face from the poster, a fragment of a model's photo from a magazine ad, a painting of a female face from a paperback cover. the boy looks puzzled, intrigued by the pictures. but with sudden speed, marcus grabs the boy's gun hand and wrenches it hard it fires into the air. marcus gets control of the gun, wraps one arm around the boy's throat.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{if i'm not in hell, where am i?!}
<C>__{boy}
<P>__{(choking)}
<D>__{texas!}
<A>__{the noise of a shotgun pumping close behind marcus marcus spins to face his attacker, pressing the handgun into the boy's cheek. he's face to face with a girl, a couple of years younger than the boy, training the shotgun at marcus' head she looks ready to shoot.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{let him go!}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{first put down the shotgun.}
<A>__{the girl shakes her head angrily. she wears an aged, beloved baseball cap with a star on it.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{do what he says.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{he'll kill us both!}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i don't wanna kill anyone.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{do it, star. put it down.}
<A>__{she shakes her head slightly, aiming carefully at marcus' head, just a few feet away, a slight smile on her face.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{there was only one bullet in that gun.}
<A>__{marcus hooks his foot around the oil lantern and deftly boots it at the girl. burning oil spills across her leg, she cries out and fumbles the shotgun. marcus tosses the boy at her, the two of them sprawl on the ground, the shotgun falling to one side marcus quickly snatches up the shotgun. using snow, the boy helps the girl extinguish the flames from her clothing. marcus stands over the kids with a gun in each hand. he struggles to control anger, speaks quietly.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i don't like it when people point guns at me.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{it wasn't loaded.}
<A>__{marcus quickly checks the chambers of both the shotgun and handgun indeed, both are empty.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you took on a guy like me with one bullet and an empty shotgun?}
<P>__{(studies them admiringly)}
<D>__{pretty stupid.}
<A>__{he shoves the handgun in his belt, puts the shotgun down and kneels to pick up fallen scraps of paper a few have caught fire and are incinerated. the boy and girl get to their feet, stare at marcus.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{can i have my gun back?}
<A>__{marcus shrugs, gestures for her to pick it up. he still looks at the pictures in his hands.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{where'd you get those?}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{in the city.}
<C>__{boy}
<P>__{(steps away from him)}
<D>__{the city? oh man. that place is red hot.}
<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(a small smile)}
<D>__{seemed kinda dead to me.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{no radiation.}
<A>__{a spotlight appears in the distance a roving hunter killer moving in their direction. quickly, automatically, the kids dive for cover behind a wall of debris. marcus looks toward the light, unaware of danger. the boy bolts from behind cover, grabs marcus by the arm }
<C>__{boy }
<D>__{get down, they've seen the light!}
<A>__{he drags marcus back behind the debris wall, just in time as the h k nears, the light finds the burning oil. it fires blue pulses, which chew up the asphalt nearby then it moves on, failing to pick out the humans. marcus is dumbfounded.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{that wasn't a helicopter...}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{it's an h k hunter killer. where the hell have you been?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{rads musta fried his brains. let's go, kyle.}
<A>__{the h k has vanished in the distance. the girl rises. the boy kyle shakes his head, stays at marcus' side.}

<C>__{kyle }
<D>__{gonna be light soon, marcus, better find cover. we spotted some buildings half a mile that way.}
<A>__{kyle points but gets no response. he shrugs, sets off with star in that direction. kyle calls over his shoulder:}

<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{eyeball. only one.}
<A>__{they drop down again. one aerostat patrols the area. it's a surveillance drone the size of a softball, shiny steel, an inset camera lens with a red glow. it flies in a geometric pattern, hovering every few seconds before continuing on. it vanishes around the corner of the fast food joint, moving in the direction of the motel. star has been timing its moves.}

<D>__{where are we going?}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{there.}
<A>__{he points toward the coast, we see a marina in the distance, a boat moored at a dock. marcus steers the atv down a slope toward the shoreline.}
<L>__{exterior coastline dock night dawn}
<A>__{marcus, kyle and star leap off the atv and sprint for a motorboat. kyle carries the rifle now. as they near the boat, marcus reacts to the sight of red eyes flickering in the darkness at the end of the dock, the blue glow of a rifle charging. marcus leaps in front of kyle and star shielding them with his body. the plasma blast envelops him, marcus is blown into the water. kyle and star are flattened by the force of the blast, lie motionless on the dock. their plasma rifle lies a few feet away. the skeletal terminator who shot marcus moves swiftly down the dock, its plasma rifle trained on the water now. it moves past kyle and star, who remain motionless on the ground, and goes to the edge of the dock blam! star snatches up their own plasma weapon, and blasts the thing in the back, knocking it into the water, which is only a few feet deep here. as it rises, she fires again, taking the terminator's head off. it goes under. the sky is beginning to lighten now as, a moment later, marcus emerges. as he climbs from the shallow water back onto the dock, kyle and star stare at him with astonishment. seeing their expressions, he checks himself for damage there's metal exposed at his shoulder, arm and hand, his face partially torn away, one eye missing. he tries to speak, but can only manage an electronic croak. kyle and star back away from him.}

<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{star puts the rifle aside, with an apologetic expression. she moves to marcus, gingerly touches his exposed metal then hugs him tightly. kyle, more stoical, looks out to sea. his expression changes, becomes almost hopeful as in the distance, a huge, black shape rises to the surface of the water, just visible against the dawn horizon. fireworks! missiles blast the h k... napalm erupts around the tanks and terminator army as a squad of a 10s scream in from over the land, firing cannons, launching air to ground missiles to take out the tanks. one a 10 flies low overhead and wags its wings.}

<D>__{kyle, could you give us a minute?}
<A>__{kyle reluctantly leaves, still looking at the photo, with a nod to marcus on the way out. he joins star in the doorway, they go off together. kate, connor and marcus are alone now. throughout scene, kate fights to maintain a steely control but she's clearly not far from tears.}

<P>__{(off his shrug)}
