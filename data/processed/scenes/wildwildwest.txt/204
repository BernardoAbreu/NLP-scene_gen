<L>__{interior tarantula below deck dusk}
<A>__{west's eyes are popping out of his head, the mechanical pressure of loveless's leg.}
<C>__{gordon }
<D>__{stop or i will shoot!}
<A>__{if possible, west's eyes pop even further. gordon shoot? new angle loveless looks up to see gordon holding the derringer on him from up above.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{you expect to kill me with that little pea shooter?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{if i have to. yes.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{why is it, that i'm unafraid?}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{i believe you gentlemen are the polar opposites of a moral dilemma and i'm stuck in the middle. on one end, we have mr. west, a man of primitive vigours uncomplicated by intellect. and on the other, there's mr. gordon. a man of ideas, but unlike myself, lacks the passion to kill for them. he'd like to be able to act his way out of it. and for some reason when he's actin', someone always seems to get killed.}
<A>__{loveless puts more pressure on west's head, he groans. gordon aims.}
<C>__{west}
<P>__{(gasps)}
<D>__{shoot him, gordon...!}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{i'm right about you, aren't i, gordon? and that's why i'm gonna kill your friend here. then i'm going to kill you.}
<A>__{pop! the shot startles loveless, west and even gordon. but when loveless realizes that he's not hit, he laughs.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{after all that, you missed.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{not exactly.}
<A>__{he gestures down loveless's legs to a punctured metal tube that's spraying a stream of hydraulic fluid all over the deck rendering the foot on west's head, powerless. west gets out from under, rubs his neck to regain circulation.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{better than a fountain pen, don't you think.}
<P>__{(nods behind gordon)}
<D>__{by the way, your chivalry's about to be tested.}
<A>__{gordon turns to see... angle amazonia and lippenreider charging him. they smash into him, driving him to the rail. as they pummel him, trying to throw him over, gordon realizes this is no time for passivity. he retaliates with a series of chops and kicks that would make west proud. over the rail, goes lippenreider. in that split second before she drops, gordon mouths "bye bye." before he can savor the moment further, amazonia clubs him from behind. gordon whirls and hits her so hard it surprises them both. over the railing she goes! as amazonia hovers there, president grant gives her the kick in the pants she needs to go sailing.}
<C>__{president grant}
<P>__{(to gordon, impressed)}
<D>__{we'll be joining them in a moment if you can't stop that thing!}
