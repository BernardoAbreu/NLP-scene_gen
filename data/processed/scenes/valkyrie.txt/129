<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{we've had no confirmation that }
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{dammit man, i saw the explosion myself. nothing else matters now. we are committed.}

<D>__{i no one has spoken to him yet.}
<A>__{stauffenberg pounds his fist on the wall, furious for the first and only time showing us a crack in his ultra cool exterior. he collects himself and looks at his watch.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{listen to me, olbricht. never mind germany. never mind europe. your life is at stake now, do you understand? if you want to live through the night you'll do exactly as i say.}

<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{i am at the airfield now. i will be in fromm's office in fifteen minutes. be there when i arrive.}
