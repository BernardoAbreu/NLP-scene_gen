<L>__{exterior hospital pearl harbor day}
<A>__{evelyn, receiving the letter at mail call. she sits on the grass under a palm tree, in paradise, reading his letter.}
<C>__{rafe's voice }
<D>__{there is one place i can go to find warmth, and that is to think of you.}
<L>__{exterior outdoor restaurant oahu day}
<A>__{evelyn is off duty, and wears a light cotton dress. she's let her hair down, and her skin has the sheen of light sweat in the tropical heat. the restaurant is barely more than a shelter of palm wood posts with a frond roof, and it looks out over the harbor. evelyn sits alone. she's brought writing paper. as the hawaiian waiter serves her an icy tropical ambrosia with chunks of pineapple and a fresh plumeria flower floating at the rim of the glass, she lifts her pen. but before she can start to write, three naval officers move over to her table from the bar. they're out of uniform too, wearing garish tropical shirts.}
<C>__{navy guy 1}
<D>__{a woman beautiful as you shouldn't be sitting alone. buy you a drink?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{thank you...ensign.}
<A>__{the guys look at each other, impressed that she could tell.}
<C>__{navy guy 1}
<D>__{ensign! smart too!}
<C>__{navy guy 2}
<D>__{so how about that drink? or dinner?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{thank you, but...i really want to be alone right now.}
<C>__{navy guy 3}
<D>__{want to see something long and hard?}
<A>__{he shows her the tattoo of an anchor on his forearm. evelyn looks away from them, toward the harbor.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i've got a letter to write.}
<C>__{navy guy 3}
<D>__{cold bitch.}
<A>__{his friends start to pull him away, but evelyn's eyes flare.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{navy guy 3}
<D>__{i said you're cold.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{cold? no, i'm just thinking about a war. and maybe you should be too.}
<A>__{they leave, shaking their heads. evelyn picks up her pen, and writes.}
<C>__{evelyn's voice }
<D>__{dear rafe... it's strange to be so far from you in body, and so close to you in spirit. but if our spirits really give our bodies life, then you should know this: every night i look at the sunset, and try to draw the last ounce of heat from its long day...}
<A>__{she looks toward the sunset now; then she writes again...}
