<L>__{interior cafe day}
<A>__{graham and ann are having lunch. ann looks to have had a lot of wine. graham drinks club soda with a twist.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{it's hard to explain. it's like... john treats everybody the same, you know? i mean, he acts just as excited about seeing somebody he hardly knows as he does when he sees me. and so i feel like, what's different about me, if i'm treated exactly the same as some acquaintance? if i don't like somebody, i don't act like i do. i guess that's why a lot of people think i'm a bitch.}
<A>__{she takes a sip of wine.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{yeah, i know. i mean, i'm not saying i know people think you're a bitch, i'm saying i know what you mean. and i don't even know that people think you're a bitch. do they?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i feel like they do.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{hmm. well, maybe you are. really, i wouldn't pay much attention.}
<A>__{ann smiles.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i know that i just don't feel a connection with very many people, so i don't waste time with people i don't feel one with.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{right, right. i don't feel connected to many people, either. other than john.}
<A>__{graham nods.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{can i tell you something personal? i feel like i can. it's something i couldn't tell john. or wouldn't, anyway.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{it's up to you. but i warn you, if you tell me something personal, i might do the same.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{okay. i think...i think sex is overrated. i think people place way too much importance on it. and i think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap. i m not saying women don't want it, i just don't think they want it for the reason men think they do.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i'm getting confused.}
<A>__{graham smiles.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{do you understand what i'm trying to say?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i think so. i remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{yes! yes! i think that's very true. very.}
<A>__{graham watches ann take a sip of wine.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{so what about kids?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{kids? what about them?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{do you want them?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{yeah, actually, i do. but john doesn't. at least not right now.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{why is that?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i don't know, he just said he wants to wait. i quit asking.}
<A>__{graham nods.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{so what's your personal thing? are you really going to tell me something personal?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{do you want me to?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{as long as it's not...gross, you know? like some scar or something. it has to be like mine, like something about you.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{agreed.}
<A>__{graham takes a sip of club soda.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i'm impotent.}
<A>__{ann looks at him closely.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{you're what?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{impotent.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{you are?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{well, let me put it this way: i cannot achieve an erection while in the presence of another person. so, for all practical purposes, i am impotent.}
<A>__{ann takes a large sip of wine. graham lights a cigarette.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{does it bother you?}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(exhales)}
<D>__{not usually. i mean, honestly, i haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so i feel i'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear headed goes.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{well...are you self conscious about it?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i am self conscious, but not in the same way that you are. you have got to be the most attractive self conscious person i've ever seen.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{why do you say i'm self conscious?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{well, i've been watching you. i've watched you eat, i've watched you speak, i've watched the way you move, and i see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. i think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. and you know what?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{they are looking at you. ann, you are truly breathtaking. i don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. and those that don't or can't resent you. and the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{my therapist said that }
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{you're in therapy?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{aren't you?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{hah! no, i'm not. actually, i used to be, but the therapist i had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. of course, i lied to him constantly, so i guess i can't hold him totally responsible...}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{so you don't believe in therapy?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i believe in it for some people. i mean, for me it was silly, i was confused going in. so i just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{well, my therapist knows me intimately.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{you had sex with you therapist?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{of course not.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{oh, see, i meant someone you've had sex with. that's part of the theory.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{excuse me for asking, but how would you know?}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{well, i wasn't always impotent.}
<A>__{ann takes another sip of wine and thinks for a moment.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{basically, yes.}
