<D>__{i can't do it.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{would you do it for a nickel?}
<C>__{nicholas}
<D>__{i can't do it.}
<A>__{rick lifts the child from the toilet.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{watch daddy.}
<A>__{rick stands in front of the toilet and relieves himself. nicholas watches by his side. he finishes and zips himself up.}

<A>__{rick's pov: a puddle on the floor. a rap on the cell door. rick turns around to find melanie (24) looking in.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i'm melanie... the baby sitter...}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{oh, right, i'm glad you could...}

<C>__{rick}
<D>__{you have a kid.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{so do you.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{not criticizing, just surprised. i don't believe anyone at their old day care had kids. if they did they kept them in a closet and only brought them out on special occasions. christmas, easter, an occasional birthday, and maybe when they had friends over for dinner, but only as a status symbol. it was like they'd say, "here's the white picket fence. here's the suv. here's the dog. oh yes, here's the 2.5 children. kids you can get back in the closet now."}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{you'd could make a fortune with a renta kid business.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{that has potential.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i've often thought of renting mine. why pay for a baby sitter when thousands of people would pay good money to set your kid on the mantle for a few hours?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{so, what's his name?}
<C>__{zach}
<D>__{i'm zach.}
<A>__{rick drops to a knee and extends his hand.}

<C>__{rick}
<D>__{you got me there. i am old.}
<C>__{zach}
<D>__{how old?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{older than dirt. when i was a kid we didn't have dirt. we had rocks and we had hammers. if we wanted dirt we banged a few rocks with really big hammers, and then we had dirt.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{worked the chain gangs?}
<C>__{zach}
<D>__{you're too old for my mom.}

<C>__{rick}
<D>__{i will have to try that. so, any questions about the job? melanie moves towards the boys.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i'm going to go talk to them for a little bit. i will let you know.}
<A>__{melanie crouches to the boy's level. they appear to take a real shine to her. nicholas hands her a book, and the four of them move to the cell cot. the boys gather round.}
<C>__{zach}
<D>__{my mom tells great stories.}
<C>__{kris}
<D>__{we don't have a mom.}
<C>__{zach}
