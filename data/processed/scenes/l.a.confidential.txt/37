<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior chief's office day}
<A>__{the chief sits behind a desk in a four star uniform. dudley smith sits to his left, d.a. ellis loew to his right. seen earlier at the mickey cohen press conference, loew is the only civilian. bud white stands across from them. there to be judged.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{officer white, you've refused to cooperate with internal affairs. but you should know this is bigger than a police board. indictments may be handed down. quite frankly, we need police witnesses to offset the damage done to the department's image. will you testify?}
<A>__{bud glances to a gray tinted mirror, then to the chief.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{no, sir. i won't.}
<A>__{the chief sighs, looks to loew.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{district attorney loew.}
<A>__{loew steps to bud, holds up a newspaper with the cell block photo. the headline: "bloody christmas."}
<C>__{loew}
<D>__{bloody christmas. the press love to label. you and officer stensland brought the liquor into the precinct. stensland was already drunk. do you see how appearing as a voluntary witness against him could offset the damage you've done to yourself?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i won't do it.}
<P>__{(staring at mirror)}
<D>__{i won't testify against my partner or anyone else.}
<C>__{loew}
<D>__{this man is a disgrace.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{your badge and gun, officer.}
<A>__{bud sets them on the chief's desk.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{this is the new l.a.p.d., white. you're suspended from duty and dismissed.}
<A>__{turning, white shoots the mirror a stiff middle finger as he makes his way out. dudley smith hides a smile.}
<B>__{other side of glass}
<A>__{exley watches, involuntarily leans back as bud passes on the other side of the glass. the chief's office dudley, loew and the chief wait as exley enters.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{ed, your observations have been astute. what's your assessment of this situation?}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{the public demands justice, sir. this was a full fledged riot of policemen. shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured. force them to retire. but someone has to swing. indict, try and convict stensland and bud white. secure them jail time. feed them to the sharks, sir. protect yourself; protect the department.}
<A>__{dudley gives exley a look. he's angry with him.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{stensland's a disgrace. straight d fitness reports from every c.o. he ever served under. but white is a valuable officer.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{white's a mindless thug.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{no, edmund. he's a man who can answer yes to those questions i ask you from time to time.}
<A>__{the chief interrupts with his own concern.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{i want to know who we give the public in contrast? the department needs role models. clean cut, forthright men the public can admire.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{i will testify, sir. i'm not afraid to do what's right.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{and i will promote you. you'll be a lieutenant immediately.}
<A>__{exley seizes the moment, going over dudley's head.}
<D>__{exley detective lieutenant.}
<A>__{the chief and dudley exchange a look. neither approves.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{ed, you're 30. your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{i know that, sir. i also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.}
<C>__{loew}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{before we start polishing our laurels, it would look better if we had a corroborative witness.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{that'll be hard to come by. the men hate a turncoat.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{jack vincennes. he's the technical advisor on 'badge of honor,' sir. he lives for it. that's the way to get him.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{all right, ed.}
<P>__{(into desk intercom)}
<D>__{call sergeant vincennes.}
<A>__{as exley starts out, dudley pulls him aside, speaks low.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{you'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{yes, dudley. i am.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{so be it.}
<B>__{jack vincennes}
<A>__{looking sharp, he strides down the hall, enters the... chief's office round two. centred on jack. exley is gone.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{sergeant, we'll get right to it. nine civilian witnesses have identified you as hitting ezekiel garcia.}
<C>__{loew}
<D>__{but my office has a stellar witness who will tell the grand jury that you hit back only after being hit.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what do i have to do?}
<C>__{loew}
<D>__{testify against the three officers who have already earned their pensions. our key witness will testify roundly, but you can plead ignorance to questions directed at the other men.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{i will guarantee you a slap on the wrist. a brief suspension followed by a temporary transfer from narcotics to ad vice.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{when you transfer out of vice, you'll be back on the show.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the show, sir?}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{badge of honor, vincennes. we need to tone down your profile for a bit.}
<A>__{the chief just got jack where he lives.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{john, i doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath. don't start now.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{okay. i will do it.}
<A>__{smiles all around. loew smiles at the two way. a move not lost on jack who wonders who might be on the other side.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{dismissed, vincennes.}
<A>__{jack leaves. the chief steps to the mirror, looks through.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{so be it. detective lieutenant.}
<B>__{other side of glass}
<A>__{exley clenches his fist in victory. the chief continues.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{ace them at the grand jury tomorrow, son. wear the smart looking suit and ace them. and, ed? lose the glasses.}
