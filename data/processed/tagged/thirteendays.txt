<D>__{we've worked up several military scenarios. before i ask general taylor to lead us through the various options, i'd like for us to adopt a rule. if we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. because once they are, i don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.}
<A>__{and there it is. the clock is running.}
<C>__{bundy}
<D>__{sir. we need to consider... if we decide to act, there's a good chance we'll end up in a general war.}
<A>__{the room falls silent. the president leans back in his chair, studying the circle of men around the table, weighing them. kenny and the others watch him in silence. a long, dramatic pause. a course that will change history is about to be chosen. the president leans forward, folds his hands on the table. fated. grave.}

<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{if we hit 'em, kill a lot of russians, they'll move against berlin. they attack berlin, that's nato... and we're at war.}
<A>__{the guys stop again. the autumn day is bright, warm, alive. the air, the distant city sounds derail the relentless train of logic for a beat. and in their faces we see that all three men, for the first time, feel the enormity of war, its shadow over everything. it's only a couple of steps away. steps that they're seriously contemplating.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{damned if we do, but if we don't, we're in a war for sure somewhere else in six months.}
<A>__{pained, the president turns away.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{no choice. this is going to cost lives any way we go. do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. we have to get rid of those missiles.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{there've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{he's right, jack. taylor is saying we may have some time. we've got to use it.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{so if there are alternatives that make sense and i'm not saying there are we need 'em. need 'em fast.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what about the allies? congress? i think we may need to start letting key people know. and they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. we're going to need to get the u.n. staff in and warmed up. jesus... i don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the soviets got that cryptographer of ours.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{we can't worry about everything right now. we've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.}

<D>__{... i know. cia and the military fucked us on the bay of pigs.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{they're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. we can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. we need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{we got a bunch of smart guys. we lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.}

<D>__{i will do it.}

<D>__{okay. kenny and i only show for the meetings you call us into. impress us. and do it fast.}
<P>__{(to kenny)}
<D>__{you're in charge of keeping this quiet. if word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. and it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{then we need to do a few things right away. no pierre. he knows, the press knows. you're going to have to keep up your schedule your movements are followed too closely. and we need to get these guys out of the white house. george ball's got a conference room at state.}

<A>__{kenny glances over his shoulder at scotty who points to a window. a beat, then kenny returns to look out the window. outside, the west wing drive is filled with limousines. a flash of dismay, but kenny covers fast.}

<L>__{interior treasury building garage night}
<A>__{a car jolts to a stop. the camera pans up over the sagging suspension, the government plates, the hood ornament revealing half of excom inside. kenny stands nearby waiting for them. the doors open, and out they pile like a bunch of clowns: bobby, mcnamara, rusk, ball, martin, dioptric, sorensen, stevenson, and nitze. they're sitting in each others' laps, banging their heads on the roof, joking, but tense.}

<D>__{an invasion...}
<C>__{general taylor}
<D>__{yes, sir. we can be sure we get all the missiles, and we remove castro so this can never happen again.}

<C>__{the president}
<D>__{is this the chiefs' recommendation?}
<C>__{general taylor}
<D>__{yes, sir. our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. the invasion happens eight days later.}
<A>__{the president leans back in his chair, turns to the man at the far end of the table: dean acheson, 60s, former secretary of state. he sits silent, like some revered oracle, the architect of the american cold war strategy of containment.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{dean. what do you think?}
<A>__{acheson arches an eyebrow, and when he speaks, his voice resonates throughout the room, powerful, smooth, hypnotic.}
<C>__{acheson}
<D>__{mr. president, you have rightly dismissed the diplomatic option. the soviet will only tie you down in negotiation, and leave us short of our goal, the removal of the missiles. negotiating will do nothing more than give them time to make the missiles operational, complicating the necessary military task we have at hand.}
<A>__{everyone in the room listens to him with rapt attention, his presence overshadowing the room, oracular:}
<C>__{acheson }
<D>__{for the last fifteen years, i have fought here at this table along side your predecessors in the struggle against the soviet. gentlemen, i do not wish to seem melodramatic, but i do wish to impress upon you one observation with all conceivable sincerity. a lesson i have learned with bitter tears and great sacrifice.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the soviet understands only one language: action. it respects only one word: force.}
<A>__{kenny stares at the old man. acheson's gaze finds his through the cigarette smoke. acheson's eyes travel to the president.}
<C>__{acheson }
<D>__{i concur with general taylor. i recommend, sir, air strikes followed by invasion, perhaps preceded by an ultimatum to dismantle the missiles if military necessity permits.}
<A>__{taylor nods, vindicated. the others murmur their approval. bobby, at the table in front of kenny and to his left, trades a dire look with kenny. this is happening too fast. bobby holds his head, looks about at the others, deeply distressed. the president sinks back in his chair, staring at acheson.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{then it appears we have three options. number one. a surgical air strike against the missiles themselves. two, a larger air strike against their air defenses along with the missiles.}
<A>__{kenny eyes bobby. bobby is writing something.}
<C>__{the president }
<D>__{and three, invasion.}
<A>__{bobby looks over his shoulder at kenny, and reaches back to him with a folded note. kenny takes it, opens it. it reads now i know who tojo felt planning pearl harbor.}
<C>__{the president }
<D>__{we're certainly going to do number one; we're going to take out these missiles, so it seems to me we don't have to wait very long. we ought to at least be making those preparations.}
<A>__{kenny gives bobby a curt nod. bobby tilts his head at the president: pass the note on to him. kenny rises, slips the note in front of the president. the president unfolds the note, and we hold on it and his reaction as in the b.g., out of focus, taylor speaks:}
<C>__{general taylor}
<D>__{yes, sir, we're preparing to implement all three options, though i must stress again, sir, there are risks to the strikes without the follow on invasion.}
<A>__{bundy clears his throat. speaks from somewhere down the table.}
<C>__{bundy}
<D>__{you want to be clear, mr. president, that we have definitely decided against a political track.}
<A>__{the president folds the note away, glances at bobby. a beat, the president looks from bobby to acheson.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{dean, how does this play out?}
<C>__{acheson}
<D>__{your first step, sir, will be to demand that the soviet withdraw the missiles within 12 to 24 hours. they will refuse. when they do, you will order the strikes, followed by the invasion. they will resist, but will be overrun. they will retaliate against a target somewhere else in the world, most likely berlin. we will honor our treaty commitments and resist them there, defeating them per our plans.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{those plans call for the use of nuclear weapons.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and what is the next step?}
<A>__{acheson sits back in his chair, smooths his moustache. a dramatic beat, and then his ominous pronouncement rings out:}
<C>__{acheson}
<D>__{hopefully cooler heads will prevail before we reach the next step.}
<A>__{a chill runs down kenny's spine. he looks in shock to the president. the president remains calm. but in place of the fated look the president has had, there's a hesitation.}
<L>__{interior west wing halls night}
<A>__{acheson strides down the hall, taylor, sweeney, carter and bundy swept along behind him. bundy is on the defensive, the others grim.}

<C>__{bundy}
<D>__{we have time.}
<C>__{general carter}

<A>__{kenny finishes pouring him and bobby a couple of more shots, discreetly turning a blind eye to the president's pain. the president returns from his desk, shirt untucked, disheveled, back stiff. he eases into his rocking chair. bobby lies sprawled on the couch. kenny sits down. they all look at each other. a beat, something like shock.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{jesus christ almighty...}
<A>__{they burst out laughing. an absurd, tension draining moment. they shoot their drinks, kenny refills.}
<C>__{kenny }
<D>__{call me irish, but i don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{acheson's scenario is unacceptable. and he has more experience than anyone.}

<D>__{there is no expert on this subject, no wise old man.}
<A>__{the president stares kenny in the face, understanding.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{the thing is, acheson's right. talk alone won't accomplish anything.}
<A>__{kenny considers the president, his face straight as he says:}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{then let's bomb the shit out of them. everyone wants to, even you, even me.}
<P>__{(there's a point)}
<D>__{it sure would feel good.}

<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{he's right. and things are happening too fast. it smells like the bay of pigs all over again.}

<C>__{the president }
<D>__{there's something...immoral about abandoning your own judgement.}

<C>__{the president}
<D>__{general lemay, do you truly believe that's our best course of action?}
<C>__{lemay}
<D>__{mr. president, i believe it is the only course of action. american is in danger. those missiles are a threat to our bomber bases and the safety of our nuclear deterrent. without our deterrent, there's nothing to keep the enemy from choosing general nuclear war. it's our duty, our responsibility to the american people to take out those missiles and return stability to the strategic situation. the big red dog is digging in our back yard, and we're justified in shooting him.}
<A>__{taylor steps in softly, smoothly: good cop to lemay's bad.}

<A>__{bundy is uncomfortable. everyone turns to him. he nods. kenny realizes he's been co opted by the military. mcnamara does too, lets out a deep breath. the president eyes bundy, then paces out from behind his desk, walks up to lemay.}

<C>__{mcnamara}
<D>__{we're kidding ourselves...}
<A>__{and not only that, in his bleary, sleep deprived fog, he begins to understand something happening down there. the camera moves over the enormous map, over the scrolling cryptic numerology. the buzz of radio communications bleeds in from the background. the overhead platform swivels on its motor, like the vast arm of some fate writing god as the watch officer on it updates the movements of the ships. mcnamara stares, at the verge of grasping something. through the door crack of genius, he has the glimpse of some grander thing, some grander design.}
<C>__{admiral anderson}
<D>__{very well. load your guns.}

<D>__{so now you've got to talk him out of it. and then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.}
<C>__{bobby}

<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{he gets it, but he's pissed.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{that's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?}
<C>__{sorensen}
<D>__{it depends on if we really believe there's been a coup.}
<A>__{that strikes a cord with kenny.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{i agree. if there has been a coup, and there's a hard line government in power now, then it doesn't matter what we say. the end of the day we'll either agree to their terms, they'll agree to ours, or we'll go to war. but what if there hasn't been a coup? what if... what if what is happening is a series of accidents?}
<C>__{sorensen}
<D>__{the second letter is an accident?}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{no. the letter is an intentional, but it's having an effect far greater than its authors intended.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what if our jupiter missiles are just a last minute haggle to salvage something? maybe a bone khruschev is throwing to the hard line, not really caring if we reject it or not?}
<P>__{(beat)}

<D>__{if they're sane and human like we are, then maybe we just refuse, and they'll let it slide, like we've been letting things slide.}

<D>__{we've only got time for one more round of diplomacy. the first airstrikes start in less than 36 hours.}

<A>__{the president leans forward. sensing he's about to speak, all eyes turn to him.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{we give them something. we tell them we'll remove the missiles from turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. we also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{and we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.}
<C>__{mccone}
<D>__{it's transparent. the press'll be all over it.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{six months from now, i'm not going to care. are you? we'll deal with it.}
<C>__{mcnamara}
<D>__{at least it will expose whether khruschev has been overthrown. we'll know what we're dealing with.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{and if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.}

<C>__{rusk}
