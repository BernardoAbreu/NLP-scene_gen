<P>__{(catching himself)}
<D>__{sorry harry, i know this is painful.}
<A>__{harry's eyes are slitted down lethally as he stares across the street.}
<L>__{interior car lot sales office day (late afternoon)}
<A>__{tight on a tape player, with simon's hand adjusting the volume. the sound of traffic noise and middle eastern music blares from the deck. pull back to see simon on the phone, talking loud, as if over the din of a real place.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{it's a great little bar, amanda, you'd love it. beirut's a great place if you know the city. listen, this isn't a secure line. i will tell you all about it when i get back tomorrow... if i live.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{scared? never! except of you }
<A>__{during this, the owner of the place, doug wurtz, has come out of the back room and looked out at the lot. what doug sees is harry, browsing among the cars. doug turns from the window and bears down on simon, who sees him coming and speeds up his rap.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{ i have to go, baby. a guy's coming toward me }
<A>__{doug grabs the phone out of his hand and slams it in the cradle.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{simon, look out there. you see that man? notice how he's looking at the cars. he's called a customer. i know it's been a while, but do you remember what you're supposed to do when we have a customer?}
