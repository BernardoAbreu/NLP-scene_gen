<A>__{cass is doing a slow, careful, acrobatic climb across milo's body in an attempt to reach the gun without waking milo up. she puts a hand on the headboard. she is lifting her knee over him, when he stirs. she freezes, waiting for him to settle. it's like playing twister, only if the person you're playing with finds out, he's going to kill you. she manages to get herself straddling him, arms stretched, the gun almost within reach, when:}

<D>__{are you trying to seduce me?}
<C>__{cass}
<P>__{(swallowing)}

<P>__{(innocently)}
<D>__{i didn't know you were still so attracted to me. i mean, i remember how you used to like to greet me at the door in nothing but a...}
<C>__{cass}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{yes, it's true, i'm still attracted to you.}
<A>__{her hand is groping around blindly, where the fuck is it? she stretches more, bringing her face even closer to milo's.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{really? wow. that's great news. you know what would be really sexy right now?}
<A>__{uh oh.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{if we both just went to sleep?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{no. if you talked dirty to me.}
<A>__{the gun seems to be getting father away. their lips are}
<B>__{almost touching now...}

<D>__{really? what part of me?}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{just...all of you.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{be specific.}
<A>__{cass blushes fiercely. if she didn't want that gun so bad...}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(helpfully)}
<D>__{my great hair? my chest? or...something lower like...}
<A>__{he reaches down and whips out:}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{my gun?}
<A>__{the gun is in his hand. that's why she couldn't reach it. he knew what she was up to this whole time. she flips off him and back onto her side. milo sits up, flipping on the lights.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i knew i couldn't trust you!}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{i knew i couldn't trust you!}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{when were you gonna tell me about the matches you found back there in the hotel room?}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{when were you gonna tell me you have no intention of helping me with my story?}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{you're right. i'm not helping you. this is my story now. this time i get to come out on top! karma, babe. k a r m a. karma....}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{oh my god, would you get over it already! so i cracked the case before you did, it was 3 years ago, it happened, stop being such a baby and move on!}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{oh i'm moving on. you know how i'm moving on? by cracking this case before you, then taking you in so you can spend this xmas in jail, all alone.}
<A>__{he rolls over, turning his back to her. cass stares at the ceiling, fuming.}
