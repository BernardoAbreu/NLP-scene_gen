<L>__{interior lodge main room}
<A>__{a large meeting hall. the room is draped, and brightly lit with fluorescent lights. at one end sits a large, gold painted wood throne. on either side are large candle holders, with lit candles. a small table serves as an altar in front of the platform. on a footstool is a potted plane with an artificial bird perched on its top. the throne and altar look like a set left over from a summer stock "macbeth". peggy and barney enter. several men lead peggy away from barney to the throne. one man places a go1den cape around her shoulders. they lead her up the platform to the throne.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{hey, george. get the lights.}
<A>__{the lights are dimmed. the room is lit by the candles. the men form a semicircle around peggy. old men at the end of their lives, they are serious and passionate about the possibilities of life beyond this world. one by one, four men from either end of the line approach the altar with offerings: a cup of wine; an egg; a gold coin; and a rose. the men rejoin the line. leo cooper, a tall, whitehaired man, takes two steps forward. the other men begin to sing a gregorian chant.}

<P>__{(to peggy)}
<D>__{are you ready, dear?}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{leo steps back, closes his eyes and spreads his arms.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{fasten your seat belts. here we go.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{lord of the universe, vast and mighty one. ruler of light, king of the sun. creator of earth, air, fire and water.}
<P>__{(kneeling down)}
<D>__{we adore thee and invoke thee! grant thine aid. look with favor upon us as we witness the regeneration of man. we behold the innocent endeavors of singleminded men and women. for we are the company of unbodied souls and immortal angels. we ask thy intervention, that this girl may return to thee on the wings of your love.}
<C>__{peggy}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{this is never going to work.}
<A>__{the old men form a circle in front of peggy. they begin to circumambulate east to west, intoning together, their heads bowed. as barney passes in front of peggy, he winks at her. she smiles back.}
<C>__{men}
<D>__{fount of life, chariot of the spirit, womb of the mother, reclaim thy child of light.}
<A>__{we hear a clap of distant thunder. peggy trembles. the artificial bird falls off the plant. peggy is struck with amazement. she begins to glow, poised to take off. the men continue to chant while:}
<C>__{leo }
<D>__{the name of your love is sacrifice. we offer up this girl, that her soul may find its home.}
<A>__{suddenly a door is opened, a gust of wind pours in and extinguishes the candles, plunging the hall into darkness.}
<C>__{leo }
<D>__{nothing to worry about. somebody get the lights.}
<A>__{the lights are turned on. all the men look to the throne. peggy is gone. they are speechless for a couple of beats.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(chipper)}
<D>__{well, the girl's gone. let's play some poker.}
<A>__{close on barney he smiles, happy that she made it. george crosses to the wall, reaches behind the drapes and presses a button. the wall slides open to reveal a fullyequipped card room. the men shuffle in.}
