<L>__{interior hysterical monk's barn night}
<A>__{a small structure housing a handful of sheep and a few chickens in wire cages. the wooden walss are full of gaps where boards have been ripped off. the hysterical monk holds a torch to illuminate the scene. one of his sheep is laying on its side...}
<C>__{hysterical monk}
<D>__{i just gave her dinner and she keeled over.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so would i. it's freezing in here.}
<C>__{hysterical monk}
<D>__{been using the wood from the walls for the fire in my cabin.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{haven't we all...}
<A>__{john kneels at the ewe. she's breathing heavy. rapidly. john puts his left hand down on the hay covered floor while he checks the animal's neck pulse with his right hand. she gives a weak "baa ah."}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{may be pneumonia. pitch some of that hay around her. stop this damn cold breeze.}
<A>__{the hysterical monk props the torch up in an empty bucket and retreives a crude iron pitchfork from the wall. starts to pile hay around the fallen animal.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{first, i will }
<A>__{he sits up to reach for his back, then stops when he sees what's on his left hand a slimy mucous like substance}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{wait a minute...}
<A>__{the hysterical monk stops on mid pitch. john rubs the material between his fingers. brings it close to his nose. sniffs.}
<C>__{hysterical monk}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't know. it's all over the ground. some sort of }
<A>__{baaa aaah!!! the ewe starts to shake quiver john tries to hold it down the hysterical monk, at this juncture, goes completely apeshit.}
<C>__{hysterical monk}
<D>__{what?! what?!}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{jesus! help m }
<A>__{the ewe is shaking so violently that john is thrown back he knocks over the bucket the torch falls into the hay the light is cut off as the torch almost smothers. then the hay starts to burn weak fire light revealing: baaaa aha sclortch h !! the ewe explodes ! stomach bursts spraying the two monks with entrails and blood they start screaming. the flickering fire light grows as... a terrible alien chest burster bursts out of the jerking and twitching carcass. it shows the characteristics of the animal in which it has gestated. tiny razor sharp teeth and black, glass like eyes peer from a enlongated head covered with downy, but gore matted wool. a quadroped, its shrunked hind legs struggling to free itself from the cooling morass of intestines. john can only scream as the most horrible nightmare he can imagine tries to slough off the animal's mortal coil. the hysterical monk, fear overcome with anger at the loss of his beloved sandy, steps in front of the near catatonic medic and instinctively thrusts his pitchfork into the creature the sharp prongs pierce its still forming body the creature wails a high pitched shriek half alien, half sheep as it is roughly torn from it's nesting place the monk lifts it twists at the end of the fork, acid blood dripping onto the wood floor each drop bursting into a little pool of fire. the hysterical monk turns to the now raging hay fire the entire corner of the barn is ablaze shoves the abomination in the sheep alien pops and sizzles as tongues of flame leap up to lap at it's struggling body tiny tail whipping about the creature dies, its fading screams are soon the only sound heard within the barn. the hysterical monk holds his fork in the flame as he looks back to check on }
<B>__{john}
<A>__{face contorted, eyes glued to the burning creature. heaving lungs push air through his diaphram, but no sound comes from his open mouth the doctor in training has seen the devil.}
