<L>__{interior vivian's apartment day}
<A>__{vivian sits on her bed, lost in thought. her bags are packed, ready to go. with a sigh she rises. she picks up the bags, exits the room. vivian stands in the dreary living room, looking at it, taking it all in for the last time. she suddenly looks more than a little bit frightened to be leaving. she musters resolve. she goes to the door, opens it and exits, closing it behind her. silence. vivian suddenly comes back in. she puts down her bags. she crosses to the kitchen where she takes coffee can piggy bank from the shelf. she puts some more bills into it, places it back where kit will find it. she turns and starts again for the door. she stops. she hears something. music. an aria from la boheme. fainterior seemingly coming from nowhere. she dismisses it she's hearing things. she opens the door. stops. the music is louder and getting louder now it's not her imagination. she hurries over to the window.}
