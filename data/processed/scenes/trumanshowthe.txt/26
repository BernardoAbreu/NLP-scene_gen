<L>__{exterior truman's house. dusk.}
<A>__{the backyard of a modest but tidy one story tract home. beyond the plank fence at the end of the property flows a busy expressway. truman wheels a lawnmower towards the garage as his wife, meryl, pulls up the drive in her four year old toyota camry. she has a sensible blue vinyl bag over her shoulder and carries a new knife set in a wooden block. she kisses truman affectionately on the cheek.}

<D>__{i got it free with the tune up.}
<A>__{looking over truman's shoulder, she notices a small uncut patch of grass, missed by truman in one of his passes.}
<C>__{meryl}
<D>__{you missed a section.}
<A>__{meryl enters the house. truman restarts the lawnmower and obediantly pushes it towards the offending patch of lawn. as the mower brushes up against the unconforming blades of grass, truman pulls back abruptly. he checks the kitchen window for meryl and wheels the mower away, leaving the patch uncut.}
