<A>__{an office building of clear architectural merit located in an industrial area. even the sign "popcorn pictures" has all the artistic dignity the name itself lacks... music enters... gradually, movement becomes choreographed...i.e., the young actor and actress running across the street do so with uncommon grace. the area matt passes is very crowded and we still haven't reached the most congested area of all as we study faces and hear snatches of the actors' preparation.}
<D>__{middle aged actor what am i, a duck?}
<C>__{older actress}
<D>__{sure i will tell you... favor first... do a nice middle aged lady a favor... a fair trade... tell you what you want to know in return for a...}
<P>__{(grimaces over dialogue she must say)}
<D>__{...a pity fu...}
<A>__{music becoming more insistent as we approach the building the mumbling of the actors taking on the sound of a wailing wall...}
<C>__{various young hysterical actresses}
<D>__{...the height of ego. you think your he manness can make me get on that elevator even though i'm phobic?... i can't get on that elevator. i don't care if... they catch us. do you get... it. do you get it! i can't! i can't... three, please.}

<B>__{two actresses}
<A>__{standing near each other exchange glares as they break each other's concentration and move apart... their movement serving as our gateway to dancing... the song "make believe" enters fully now and builds in intensity, reaching a repeated phrase, as we move to matt and he enters the building, thereby cutting off the song.}
<B>__{on matt}
<A>__{as the song continues in intensity, matt enters the building at the end of a repeated phrase cutting off the song as we move to:}
<B>__{angle on reception area}
<A>__{where cathy breslow, age 30, waits. hollywood is a bit of an uphill struggle for cathy. she is bright where others are brilliant, pretty where others are gorgeous, enormously hard working where others are obsessive compulsive. she is clearly waiting for someone while reading an enormously thick book galley. matt almost scoots by her, then stops.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{hi... see, i did recognize you. you didn't have to wait for me.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{well, i wanted to introduce you. as if knowing me would help.}
