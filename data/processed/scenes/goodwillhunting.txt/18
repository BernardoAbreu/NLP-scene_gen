<D>__{hey, bobby champa! i went to kindergarten with you right? sister margaret's class...}
<A>__{bobby is bewildered by this strange interruption and unsure of will's intentions. just when it looks as though bobby might remember him, will drills him with a sucker punch which begins the fight sequence: 40 frames over m. gaye's "let's get it on." will's momentum and respectable strength serve to knock the hapless champa out cold. as soon as will hits bobby, his friends converge on will. billy jumps in and wrestles one guy to the ground. the two exchange messy punches on the sidewalk. will is in trouble, back pedaling, dodging punches, trying to avoid being overrun. when will goes for one guy, another has an open shot and he hammers will with a right hand to the head. will is staggered and bleary, as a second guy winds up for a shot he is blind sided by chuckie who hits the kid like he was a tackling sled, lifting him off the ground. chuckie turns to see will still outnumbered. it's all will can do to stay standing as morgan drop kicks one of champa's boys from the hood of a car. contrary to what we might think, morgan is actually quite a fighter. he peppers the kid with a flurry of blows. the fight is messy, ugly and chaotic. most punches are thrown wildly and miss, heads are banged against concrete, someone throws a bottle. in the end, it's our guys who are left standing, while bobby's friends stagger off. chuckie and morgan turn to see will, standing over the unconscious bobby champa, still pounding him. angle on will: savage, ugly, vicious, and violent whatever demons must be raging inside will, he is taking them out on bobby champa. he pummels the helpless, unconscious champa, fury in his eyes. chuckie and billy pull will away. the police finally arrive on the scene and having only witnessed will's vicious attack on champa, they grab him.}
