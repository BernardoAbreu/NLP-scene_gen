<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{the early twilight shadows are beginning to fall. the sky is still clear but the sun is fading. there is a deep silence and the air is absolutely still. in a certain sense, sandro's car, standing there in the middle of the deserted street, is the only thing alive in that desolate town. huddled close to each other, claudia and sandro are asleep on the grass. lazily, claudia awakens, and then sandro also opens his eyes. they are both somewhat disheveled.}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(faintly audible)}
<D>__{it's late... we should be going.}
<A>__{little by little, she leaves behind the drowsiness of her deep and peaceful sleep, purring languorously in a typically feminine fashion. sandro smiles and gently embraces her. a moment later, claudia releases herself from sandro's arms, sits up and realizes that the countryside and the town itself are as black and motionless as death. a cold shiver runs down her back and she quickly comes to her feet.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{let's get out of here, fast... this is not a town, it's a cemetery.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{who knows why they all left...}
<A>__{claudia starts to move but her legs are still numb from her sound sleep and she hobbles along comically, laughing at the same time. sandro also gets up and finds that his legs are cramped. hobbling and laughing himself, he follows claudia towards the car. but the car, baked by the sun, is like an oven. they both make boisterous and playful exclamations, then another embrace, another kiss. finally, they climb into the car and drive off with a loud roar that echoes up and down the abandoned town.}
