<L>__{interior landing outside old salieri's salon night}
<A>__{the cook is standing holding the candlestick in one hand, the dish of cakes in the other. the valet arrives, panting.}
<C>__{valet}
<D>__{did he open?}
<A>__{the cook, scared, shakes his head: no. the valet again knocks on the door.}
<C>__{valet}
<D>__{here i am, signore. now open the door.}
<A>__{he eats the sugared cake in his hand, elaborately and noisily.}
<C>__{valet}
<D>__{mmmm this is good! this is the most delicious thing i ever ate, believe me! signore, you don't know what you're missing! mmmm!}
<A>__{we hear a thump from inside the bedroom.}
<C>__{valet}
<D>__{now that's enough, signore! open!}
<A>__{we hear a terrible, throaty groaning.}
<C>__{valet}
<D>__{if you don't open this door, we're going to eat everything. there'll be nothing left for you. and i'm not going to bring you anything more.}
<A>__{he looks down. from under the door we see a trickle of blood flowing. in horror, the two men stare at it. the dish of cakes falls from the cook's hand and shatters. he sets the candlestick down on the floor. both servants run at the door frantically once, twice, three times and the frail lock gives. the door flies open. immediately, the stormy, frenzied opening of mozart's symphony no. 25 (the little g minor) begins. we see what the servants see.}
