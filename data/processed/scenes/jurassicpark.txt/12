<L>__{int hammond's quarters day}
<A>__{hammond ushers his guests into his own richly appointed baronial suite. ellie looks out a small window at the tee pees and the contrasting lifestyle below. she then focuses on the high fence, circling the perimeter of hammond's quarters. above is a skylight, with metal bars. grant whispers to her, indicating the obviously modified window frame.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{who makes a windows ... smaller?}
<A>__{timmy smacks him forehead, points to grant.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{i know you. you wrote my book. lost world of the dinosaurs. it's awesome.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{timmy's got dinosaurs on the brain.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{don't worry he'll grow out of it.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{dr. grant's embarrassed that his book was so widely successful. he wrote if for gra}
<A>__{duate students. hammond smiles intensely. but he's patient. he stands be a huge table covered with a sumptuous velvet drape.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{although dr. grant suspects otherwise, this is not an ill conceived, half baked, poorly funded plan that i've headed. this is a plan to which i committed all of my personal resources, literally billions of dollars. and donald gennaro here has kindly helped me raise that sum again from wealthy japanese. they love theme parks. i have recruited pre eminent scientific minds from hallowed universities and we've taken the time to do things right.}
<A>__{lex peeks under the cloth. hammond smiles at her and recovers the table.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{jurassic park is the most advanced amusement park in the world. we work with genetics life's essential building blocks to create new}
<A>__{worlds. i set out}
<D>__{to make biological attractions. living attractions. attractions so astonishing that they'd capture the imagination of the entire world.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{what exactly do you mean ... biological attractions?}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{as you well know, long ago, creatures ten times larger than whales roamed our adolescent earth. and then mass, mysterious extinction created a time barrier unscalable until ... now.}
<B>__{beat.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{dinosaurs.}
<P>__{(superbly proud)}
<D>__{i've been cloning dinosaurs!}
<A>__{camera pushes in on grant's incredulous face. hammond whips off the drape, revealing a complex and detailed scale model of the entire resort.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, jurassic park. not a resort, not a scien}
<A>__{tific conservatory,}
<D>__{just a little piece of pre history that every child in the whole wide world will insist on visiting.}
<A>__{hammond grins with delight.}
<C>__{gennaro}
<D>__{at least every rich child.}
<A>__{grant and ellie come forward to examine the model. the kids crowd in. camera snorkels through the model revealing different enclosures with miniature dinosaurs, moats, fences, roads, a river.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{apatosaurs in the lowland. gallimimus in the grassy plain. dilophosaurus above the river. the mighty tyrannosaurus rex! 238 fabulous creatures so far!}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{real dinosaurs, grandpa? don't they want to just kill each other?}
<A>__{hammond excitedly punches a button colored display grids light up.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{timmy, there's electric fences and moats and video surveillance at all times. there}
<A>__{are monitors every hundred feet}
<D>__{whatever we could plant them on the island. a computer to tabulate it all.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{you created dinosaurs? who gave you the right to do that?}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{i didn't create them. i found a way to wake them up, to stir them out of their prehistoric slumber.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{we don't have the science. there's no source of dinosaur dna.}
<A>__{hammond's proud, excited face shifts to one that divulges modestly.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{yes ... there is.}
