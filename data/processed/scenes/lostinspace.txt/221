<A>__{don and the robot, will riding his back, navigate the terrain alongside the ravaged hull of the jupiter two.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{look.}
<A>__{on the ground, crumpled in a heap, is smith. don checks his pulse.}
<C>__{west}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{damn. he's still breathing.}
<A>__{(over) the rushing wind. rumbling. a portal opens before them to a far younger world. then another portal, to a world far older. a third portal rips across the sky overhead.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{the time machine must be near full power. the portals are collapsing.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{which one leads us home?}
<A>__{more portals are opening around them, others winking shut.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{there.}
<A>__{through a new rip in time, the intact jupiter two can be seen in relief of the battered future craft. the ground beneath their feet is beginning to give way.}
<C>__{will}

<C>__{west}
<D>__{sure we can.}

<A>__{the portal is beginning to shimmer. the ground starts to fall away.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{jump!}
<A>__{don hurls smith through, will, the robot and west darting across the threshold just as the portal winks closed.}
