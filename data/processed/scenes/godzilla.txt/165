<L>__{interior bedroom same late afternoon}
<A>__{audrey has been crying. crumpled kleenex wads piled up all around her. a television plays a news broadcast, boasting the headline: they call him}
<B>__{godzilla}
<A>__{! on the t.v. we see a news conference with general anderson addressing some reporters.}
<C>__{reporters}
<P>__{(simultaneously)}
<D>__{can you comment on the nest? how many more of these things will there be?}
<C>__{general anderson}
<P>__{(filtered)}
<D>__{that's why i'm holding this conference. to try and avoid a needless panic.}
<A>__{animal enters and watches from the back of the room.}
<C>__{general anderson}
<D>__{contrary to some frivolous reports, we have no information to lead us to believe that there are any eggs of the creature in the city.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{stupid idiots!}
<C>__{animal}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{it's all my fault. what have i done, animal? what have i become? look at me. this isn't me. i don't do things like this.}
<C>__{animal}
<D>__{you made a mistake.}
<A>__{suddenly someone exits the bathroom and crosses out of the room. animal looks at the stranger as he leaves.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{yeah, i just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.}
<C>__{animal}
<D>__{didn't you tell me he left for the airport?}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{yeah. why are you asking?}
<C>__{animal}
<D>__{i just saw him. he's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.}
<A>__{audrey tries to make sense of this. suddenly she realizes.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{my god. he's going after the nest.}
<C>__{animal}
<D>__{perfect! you wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.}
<A>__{excitedly animal goes to the closet and retrieves a big overcoat.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{animal, i can't.}
<C>__{animal}
<D>__{look, you want to make it up to your friend? well if he's right, this is your chance.}
<A>__{he starts going through his drawers, taking out battery packs, tapes, etc, and putting it in his pockets.}
<C>__{audrey}
<P>__{(misgivings)}
<D>__{i don't know. i've already made such a mess of things...}
<A>__{animal walks up to the door, ready to exit.}
<C>__{animal}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{audrey, i'm going after them. you can come with me or not.}
<A>__{conflicted, audrey is not sure what to do. animal opens the bedroom window and begins to climb out.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{animal}
<D>__{lucy'd kill me if she knew.}
