<A>__{a shot of buddy in his room at night. he is dressed and at a study table listening with cheap earphones to a homemade crystal radio set. enter a rather somber faced doll in her nightgown.}
<C>__{buddy}
<P>__{(listening)}
<D>__{chattanooga. i had st. louis, missouri.}
<C>__{doll}
<D>__{buddy, i'm worried about rose.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{so am i.}
<C>__{doll}
<D>__{she hasn't got any sense. in some ways, she's awful dumb.}
<C>__{buddy}
<P>__{(takes off earphones,}
<D>__{gives it a moment of grave consideration, then}
<P>__{his opinion)}
<D>__{it isn't that she hasn't got any sense, doll. her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.}
<C>__{doll}
<D>__{then why does she act so dumb?}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{dumbness doesn't concern her, doll. and neither does smartness. you see }
<A>__{buddy is interrupted by the sound of the distant angry shout of a man's voice, evidently from somewhere outside in the woods because buddy and doll turn at once toward the window. in shock they listen.}
<C>__{first man's voice}
<D>__{you son of a bitch, what are you doing here?!}
<C>__{second man's voice}
<D>__{i'd like to ask you the same question, you bastard!}
<C>__{first man's voice}
<D>__{i told you to stay away from her, goddamn you!}
<C>__{second man's voice}
<D>__{you got no right to tell me to stay away from her, i knew her before you did!}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{oh, boy. oh, boy, oh boy. daddy isn't going to like this.}
<C>__{first man's voice}
<D>__{she told you to leave her alone, didn't she?}
<C>__{second man's voice}
<D>__{like hell she did! you're the one she wants to get shed of!}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{he and doll hurry from the room.}
