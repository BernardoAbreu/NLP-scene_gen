<L>__{exterior porch of alma's house night}
<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{the porch is at the rear of the house, leading off from the living room. it is on the very edge of the cliff. prew and alma are dancing to the music of a portable victrola. it is playing "why don't we do this more often?" a table still contains the dinner plates. prew's expression holds the wonder of a child at a magic show. he misses a step, stumbles.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{i never caught on to dancing much.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{you're a very good dancer.}
<A>__{the record ends and alma goes to change it. camera follows prew to the edge of the porch as he looks out over the view. long shot view prom prew's pov a magnificent panorama strings of lights in the valley and across on st. louis heights in the far distance the neon of waikiki.}
<B>__{medium close shot prew}
<A>__{working with his thoughts, afraid to broach them. he lights a cigarette, his fingers trembling.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{i been wanting to tell you a long time now }
<P>__{(deep breath)}
<D>__{i love you.}
<B>__{medium close shot alma}
<A>__{looking through records for a new choice. she speaks quite conversationally, as if offered a pleasant compliment.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{that's nice. because i love you, too.}
<A>__{she puts on a record "it all comes back to me now." it plays throughout the sequence.}
<C>__{two shot}
<A>__{as alma comes over to prew.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{i mean it. i need you.}
<C>__{alma}
<P>__{(as before)}
<D>__{i'm glad. because i need you, too.}
<C>__{prew}
<P>__{(recklessly)}
<D>__{a thirty year man is movin all over, goin all the time. up to now i never thought a thirty year man had any business to think of gettin married.}
<A>__{she stares at him, amazed, a touch angry.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{you're a funny one, little prew boy.}
<C>__{prew}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{yeah. must be the altitude.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{a very funny one that i cannot figure out.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{why's it funny if a guy wants to marry you?}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{because i'm a girl you met at the new congress club! and that's about two steps up from the pavement.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{okay i'm a private no class dogface soljer. and the way most civilians look at it, that's two steps up from no thin.}
<A>__{there is a silence. alma is honestly distraught.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{oh, prew, prew, i thought we were happy: why do you want to spoil things?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{lissen, i ain't think in of now. but i got a plan cookin in my head. you want to go back to the states in a year. well, you could stretch it some, make it two years. and i could swing a sergeant's stripes if i were a non com the army'd let me pick my duty when i re enlist.}
<P>__{(lost in the picture of it)}
<D>__{and there's some posts back in the states like jefferson barracks the married noncoms rate solid brick houses... with lawns with new cut grass and walks with big old oak trees...}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{now i know you've lost your mind! how do you expect to become a sergeant under this captain holmes of yours? it's all you can do to keep out of the stockade!}
<B>__{close shot prew}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{i could fight.}
<C>__{two shot}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{it i go out for boxin he'd send me to non com school. the regimental championship is next month. i bet i could win the middleweight even without training. i used to be pretty good i could do it.}
<A>__{alma is deeply moved. she speaks gravely, sincerely, not at all immodestly.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{no. i don't think you should give in to the treatment... even to marry me.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{this'd be worth it.}
<C>__{alma}
<P>__{(almost desperately)}
<A>__{prew it's true we love each other now. but back in america, it might be different... we might not even want each other...}
<C>__{prew}
<A>__{okay. but that ain't the real reason.}
<C>__{alma}
<A>__{all right. it's not.}
<C>__{prew}
<A>__{what's the real reason you won't marry me?}
<C>__{alma}
<A>__{i won't marry you because i don't want to be the wife of a soldier.}
<C>__{prew}
<A>__{well, that's the top i could ever do for you }
<C>__{alma}
<A>__{because nobody's going to stop me from my plan. nobody. nothing. because want to be proper.}
<C>__{prew}
<A>__{proper?}
<C>__{alma}
<P>__{(impassioned)}
<A>__{yes, proper. respectable. secure. in a year i will have enough money saved. i'm going back to my home town in oregon and i'm going to build a new home for my mother and myself and join the country club and take up golf. and then i will meet the proper, man with the proper position. and i will be a proper wife who can keep a proper home and raise proper children. and i will be happy because when you are proper you are safe.}
<C>__{prew}
<P>__{(bitterly disappointed but admiring)}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{you got guts, alma. i hope you pull it off.}
<A>__{the victrola record ends. alma turns away from prew and goes to the victrola. now that shots had her say with such certainty, she deflates. except for the fact that she looks like a girl who never cries, she looks as if she might cry. she lifts the record off the turntable.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{but i do mean it when i say i need you. because i'm lonely. sometimes i'm dreadfully lonely... you think i'm lying, don't you?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{no. nobody ever lies about being lonely...}
<A>__{alma puts the same record on again. prew looks out over the beautiful view.}
