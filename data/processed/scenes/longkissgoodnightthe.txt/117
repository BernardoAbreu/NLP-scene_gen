<A>__{charly, sweating at sub zero. brushes hair from her eyes. blinks. still jabbing with the knife, why the hell is she digging? gonna crawl under the damn door? she's gone loopy. lying flat, she appraises her work a tiny notch. poked through to the other side. the actual penetration to daylight: millimeters. then, she does two seemingly nonsensical things: crosses to caitlin gently takes the doll from her, then:}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{open.}
<A>__{reaches in her mouth. takes out her retainer. must be the temperature. crosses to the door again. kneels down. calmly, with infinite care, takes the retainer... inverts it, now it's trough shaped. holds it flush against the tiny notch she carved. baby doll, now. holds it directly above the retainer. depresses the knob in its back: it pees gasoline. gas, trickling down the retainer, through the brick into the other room. not much. enough. she stands. draws a trail with the doll. crosses, dribbling, over to caitlin. hands the doll back to her. what nexterior.? she grabs the hunting knife, that's what. raises it high one terrifying moment, is she gonna put it in the kid...? hardly. brings it down on the floor. slams it down.}

<D>__{for lighting your candle.}
<A>__{charly stares, dumbstruck, at the tiny gift. the bitterness, the self hatred, all of it. under innocent eyes on christmas eve detonates, blown sky high, and she sweeps up her daughter and cradles her, tears streaming...}
