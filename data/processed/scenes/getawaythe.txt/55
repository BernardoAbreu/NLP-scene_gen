<L>__{interior a dentist's office}
<A>__{the d.d.s. tortures a balding patient with a drill. the patient groans, lifts one leg in the air from the pain. when the power goes, the dentist quizzically raises the drill and examines it. the patient pants in relief.}
<C>__{dentist}
<D>__{superior technology, my ass.}
<A>__{an electric weather time indicator above the town square... as the bulbs dim... doc running down the sewer; stopping at the manhole he scrambles up the permanent ladderway, tossing his wire cutters up into the truck parked over him. carol in the driver's seat again she tries to start the engine. doc pulling himself back up into the van with a gymnastic thrust he quickly slides the manhole cover with the tongs. carol the engine still won't start. doc drops the hatch door back down into place on the floor of the truck...}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(snapping his look to carol)}
<D>__{okay.}
<B>__{carol turns the ignition switch back on...}
<A>__{carol as the engine roars to life she engages the gearshift. the truck begins to move forward. suddenly, the motor does stall. doc's pace tightens. the cars behind the van continue}
<B>__{honking.}
<A>__{carol again grinding away at the engine. her lips are compressed into a thin line... after a moment... the motor catches, the truck again moves forward. doc picks up the large black suitcase from the floor of the panel truck, then begins to move toward the cab and carol. the panel truck whips off main street and onto a side avenue. carol pulls the van up to the curbway, jerking to a stop. doc is now in the front seat beside carol. he pulls the truck door open, then hesitates. he touches her arm, their eyes meet briefly, both their faces warming for a moment. doc gives her a casual wink then quietly exits the truck.}
<B>__{on the sidewalk}
<A>__{doc turns and begins walking toward an open alleyway. behind him the panel truck pulls smoothly away. walking up the alley doc pulls on a pair of black gloves. he turns again, now moving down a totallydeserted side alley. the alley opens at one end onto a back street; the opposite end is bounded by a large brick building. doc removes his pistol from his coat pocket, then approaches a doorway along the side of the brick building. at the last moment he pulls down the watch cap mask.}
