<L>__{2 bean sits down and who should be his next door neighbour? the grand man,}
<A>__{whose name is reynolds. bean smiles merrily. the affection is not mutual. champagne comes round instantly. bean takes it, along with a small bowl of nuts, and clinks glasses with his unsmiling partner. bean tries to impress him by throwing nuts up into the air and catching them in his mouth (a well practised art). no response. bean then switches on the noisy overhead air blower. then can't turn it down again. it's very stuck. he manages however to push it away from his face straight into reynolds' . reynolds looks annoyed, bean guiltless. then 'bean has an idea. he takes a tissue out of his pocket, puts in his mouth, chews it into a spitball and rams it into the blower. both of them are relieved. reynolds picks up his champagne to have his first proper sip. and whapp! the spitball, under high pressure, shoots into it, sending champagne spraying all over reynolds. not a good start.}
