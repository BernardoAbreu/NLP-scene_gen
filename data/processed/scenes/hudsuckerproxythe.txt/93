<A>__{as norville falls the last few feet and lands on his face with one last mighty bong of the hudsucker clock.}
<B>__{boom down}
<A>__{from a tavern sign that says ann's 440, down to the front door, which norville is entering.}

<A>__{sitting halfway down the bar is amy, staring morosely into a coffee cup. at the cut : we are tracking back, pulling away from her. norville enters, comes up next to her and makes the go eagles sign, hooking his thumbs in front of his nose and spreading his fingers. two familiar voices narrate the scene, sounding a little tipsy:}

<D>__{this you're familia' with.}
<A>__{our pull back ends looking across an elbow of the bar, towards norville and amy, now in wide shot. resting on the bar in the extreme f.g. are two champagne glasses, half full of fizzing champagne. norville and amy kiss.}
<C>__{lou }
<D>__{...geez.}
<C>__{benny }
<D>__{...geez.}
<A>__{we hear labored, raspy breathing.}

<D>__{...y'all right, benny?}
<A>__{in a quavering voice:}
<C>__{benny }
<D>__{...yeah, i'm... it's just... it's beautiful, lou!}

<D>__{it's the most beautiful t'ing i ever saw.}
<A>__{a bartender enters to block our view of norville and amy. he is youngish, with a beat goatee, wearing dungarees and a sweatshirt with cut off sleeves. he looks to either side at benny and lou.}

<D>__{crazy. get you anything else? sangria? carrot juice? herbal tea?}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{we see benny and lou are sitting side by side at the bar. lou wears a fake whispy beard and white eyebrows and a long flowing robe; he holds a fake scythe. on the bar next to him sits a large hourglass.}

<A>__{benny is wearing nothing but an oversized diaper, a baby bonnett and a sash across his hairy chest and thick belly that says "1959." he chucks himself in the heart, cocks his head and sucks in air, then blows it back out.}

<D>__{...bromo.}

<A>__{the hand reenters to lay down a wallet, and then to deposit a burning cigar in an ashtray.}
<C>__{moses }
<D>__{...and the start of a new business cycle. when he learned that norville owned the comp'ny, ol' sidney was upset at first.}
