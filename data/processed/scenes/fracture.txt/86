<L>__{interior hospital room late that night}
<A>__{the life support system clicks and hisses and beeps. jennifer is curled into a fetal position, despite the tubes and wires. willy sits by her bed. still in his suit from court, the jacket off, the tie loose. he's been there a while. but now he speaks.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{your husband said something...that i can't seem to shake loose of. he said i'm a winner.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and he's right. i can't lose. i can't stand people who lose.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i may have been working so hard to put some distance between me and...people like you that maybe i messed up. i don't know if did anything wrong. or what i should have done. i really don't know, any more...what i'm supposed to do.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but i feel like i let you down. somehow in the...process. and if i did, i'm sorry. that's all. i just i hope you...have...just, some...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{anyway.}
<A>__{he feels stupid. takes a breath. looking at her pale, drawn, comatose face. he stands, goes to get his jacket, lying folded on a table by the door. pulls it on, settles the shoulders, tugs at his cuffs. gets his briefcase. he goes to the door, and as he opens it he looks back. freezes. jennifer's eyes are wide open. she's staring at him. willy stands, breathless, watching her.}
