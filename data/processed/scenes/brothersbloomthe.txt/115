<L>__{exterior prague streets day}
<A>__{penelope and bloom stroll home in silence through crowded, vibrant cobblestone streets.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{you aren't constipated. you're scared. what are you scared of?}
<A>__{they walk on, suddenly somehow holding hands. as they approach the hotel, bloom deftly breaks their hand holding off. penelope notices why.}
<L>__{interior prague hotel room continuous}
<A>__{stephen, up in the window watching them approach. he recedes into the room.}
<L>__{exterior prague streets night}
<A>__{the sun sets against the castle, taking us into night.}
<L>__{interior prague hotel bar night}
<A>__{bloom drinks alone, sketching penelope's face with a pencil. a smell breaks his concentration.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{diamond dog, carrying a cup and a cane.}
<A>__{standing behind him, a soft old man in an ashy suit and eyepatch. the diamond dog.}
<C>__{diamond dog}
<D>__{bloom. how long has it been?}
<P>__{(sits, orders)}
<D>__{tea.}
<P>__{(to bloom)}
<D>__{can you believe that? tea? been a long while.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{if i call stephen down he'll kill you.}
<C>__{diamond dog}
<D>__{well then please don't call stephen down. look at you, you're terrified. c'mon now, look. take a look. i'm an old man with no depth perception. you don't have to be scared of me.}
<A>__{the dog plays with a heavy gold lighter, making sparks.}
<C>__{diamond dog }
<D>__{it's been a funny thing, watching you boys take what i taught you and eclipse me. i'm so proud to be a footnote in the lives of the brothers bloom. and you hate me. the curse of all bad fathers that my presence on this earth after i die will not live on the lips of admiring men, but will sink into the murky backwaters of my children's psyches.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{is this profundity? cause you can skip it.}
<C>__{diamond dog}
<D>__{ha! ha ha. piss and vinegar.}
<A>__{the dog scoots next to bloom.}
<C>__{diamond dog }
<D>__{when i first took you boys in, showed you the ropes, haunting st. pete's, piss and vinegar. i still crave that youthful joy. even today.}
<A>__{the dog's hand touches bloom's leg. there is something horrible about this. beneath the bar, bloom grips the sharp pencil like a knife.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{don't touch me.}
<C>__{diamond dog}
<D>__{you probably won't believe i loved you boys very much.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{you're going to take your hand away or i'm going to break your arm, there's nothing between.}
<A>__{he does, but bloom's fingers don't loosen on the pencil.}
<C>__{diamond dog}
<D>__{but love, you know. we know, folks like us, you can always blink and realize that it's a fiction, and like peter walking on water or wiley coyote running off a cliff, if you look down in doubt you'll fall. that's the price of our lives, the wax in our wings. one day stephen's going to fall. it may be glorious, but he's going to fall hard and he won't be there to tell you what to do and protect you. when he's gone, remember me.}
<A>__{the dog has moved in very close to bloom, his breath hot on his face, and his hand comes to rest fully on bloom's leg. bloom's hand with the pencil quivers, about to strike when bloom is pulled from the bar stool by a heavy hand. stephen, his eyes burning through the dog.}
<C>__{diamond dog }
<D>__{hello stephen.}
<A>__{stephen smashes a bottle from the bar and slashes it across the dog's hand. waiters and porters tackle him, the dog howls, holding his bleeding hand. bloom stands numb, and puts the pencil in his pocket.}
