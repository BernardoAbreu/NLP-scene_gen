<L>__{exterior local golf course sunset}
<A>__{ben and father in law are having a drink after a round of golf, outside the club house.}
<D>__{father in law i'm getting tired of the trek to cape town and then back to pretoria. if i had my way, parliament and government would be in the same city. there's nothing wrong with pretoria.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i thought you'd prefer cape town; the sea and table mountain. father in law that's for holidays. anyway, ben, one of the reasons for this visit was that i wanted to have a discussion with you.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what about? father in law it's that photograph in the papers. ben, a thing like that could be an embarrassment for someone who is a member of parliament. it's a grievous day when one's family's behavior comes between him and his duty to the fatherland.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{are you blaming me for trying to help those people? father in law i've been doing that all my life, be they black or white. but no member of our family has been seen with a kaffir woman before, ben.}
<A>__{father signals the african waiter for more drinks.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i am glad you mentioned it, father. because i'd like to discuss the whole thing with you. first, there's the matter of gordon ngubene himself. father in law what about him? i thought the case was closed.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{the inquest didn't clear up half of what happened. father in law oh, really?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{we have no irrefutable evidence yet, but we have enough to indicate that something serious is being covered up. father in law you're jumping to conclusions, ben.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i know what i'm talking about. the black waiter places the drinks on the table. father in law all right, ben, i'm listening. perhaps i can use my influence. but you'll have to convince me}
<A>__{first.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{if they have really nothing to hide, why is the special branch going out of its way to intimidate me. father in law}
<P>__{(practically choking)}
<D>__{what's this about special branch?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{they raided the house; they are tapping my phone, and i have been threatened by one of the officers. father in law i'm sorry, ben, i'd rather not have anything to do with this sort of thing.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{why? father in law if the special branch are involved they must have good reasons.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it's exactly what i said, father, when jonathan first got into trouble. of course, they have good reasons: hushing up how gordon died and how his son died! father in law}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{ben, how could you side with the enemies of your people?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you mean you're prepared to sit back and allow an injustice to be done. father in law}
<P>__{(his face grows purple)}
<D>__{it's you, ben, who talk about injustice? a man who teaches history at school? did you forget what our people have suffered under the english oppressors? now that we have at along last come to power in our own land.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{now we're free to do to others what they used to do to us. what will you do if you were a black man in this country today, father? father in law don't you realize what the government is doing for the blacks? it's a slow process, ben. one of these days the whole bloody lot of them will be free and independent in their own parts of the land, the bantoustans what can be more just than that? but they're not ready yet.}
<A>__{the waiter returns father in law pays the bill, and as he rises to leave, he puts a paternal arm on ben's shoulder.}
<D>__{father in law we have nothing to be ashamed of before the eyes of the world, my boy.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(standing, his golf bag in his hand)}
<D>__{we don't? i'm not sure we're going to survive.}
<A>__{they walk away.}
<D>__{father in law don't underestimate us, ben. our power of survival. we are afrikaners!}
