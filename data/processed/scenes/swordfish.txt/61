<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i heard this story about this young hacker who made a virus that broke the f.b.i.'s carnivore program that was actively reading every subscriber's e mail and scrambled the systems. he did what the federal judges wouldn't do and kept the government out of our privacy.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{i think i heard that. story is he went to jail and the federal carnivore program is back in full swing. it was a real tragedy. what can i do for you?}
<A>__{changing the subject.}
<C>__{gabriel}

<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{take a look at this.}
<A>__{he is handed an open laptop, it glows. he sets it on the table and spins it around in front of stanley.}
<C>__{stanley}
<P>__{(like an alcoholic}

<D>__{you know i can't touch that.}
<A>__{helga pours a shot of tequila.}
<C>__{helga}
<D>__{you like tequila, stanley?}
<A>__{helga shoots the tequila, then turns to stanley, places her lips against his. the gold liquid drips from their lips as she spits it into stanley's mouth. he pushes her away, breaking the liplock, and swallowing the tequila. she licks it from his face.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{no need for modesty, we're all friends here, stanley.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{this is bullshit. i came }
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you want something from me, amigo, i want something from you. d.o.d. dbase, 128 bit r.s.a. encryption. whattaya think? impossible?}
<A>__{stanley's having a little trouble concentrating on gabriel.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{nothing's impossible.}
<A>__{helga begins sucking on stanley's fingers. he pulls them away.}
<C>__{gabriel}

<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{something like that. is this an interview?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{sort of. marco, let's give him some incentive.}
<A>__{the drapes close. two of gabriel's crew step out. marco yanks out a .40 caliber glock and quickly screws a well used silencer onto the end. marco walks around behind stanley.}
<C>__{stanley}
<P>__{(now totally confused)}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{helga smiles, then drops her head into stanley's lap. we hear his pants unzip.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{relax, stanley.}
<A>__{he has to go with it.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i've been told the best crackers in the world could do this in sixty minutes. unfortunately, i need someone who can do it in sixty seconds.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{you're kidding...}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{'fraid not.}
<A>__{stan realizes now no one is smiling. he grabs the blonde by the hair but can't pull her up.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{forty five seconds. time is a wasting, big guy.}
<A>__{the silencer is pressed into the back of his head. stanley tries to focus on the screen. stanley sucks air through his teeth, trying to focus.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you have thirty seconds, stanley.}
<A>__{stanley gives up on trying to get her up and his hands start flying over the keyboard. we intercut : the action with a closeup of stanley's hands working the keyboard, and a closeup of gabriel, and a closeup of the lcd screen which reads in flashing red letters "access denied."}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{she's very good, isn't she, stanley?}
<A>__{tension builds as stanley continues to work the keyboard. "access denied."}

<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{three... two...}
<A>__{"access denied." he grabs her head. she doesn't come up. the screen flashes: "access denied."}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{too bad, stanley. ya gotta die.}
<A>__{marco puts the silencer to his eye.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{wait... !}
<A>__{click. the gun is empty. stanley tries to catch his breath. helga lifts up her head. everyone laughs. gabriel walks around the table.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i was just fucking with you, stan.}
<A>__{stanley is pissed. helga, smiling, kisses him on the cheek. stanley tries to calm down. he gets up, shoots someone's half drank drink, zips his pants, then }
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{so was i.}
<A>__{stanley hits the enter key and spins the computer around. closeup computer screen "access granted" appears, and the department of defense logo scrolls across the screen.}
