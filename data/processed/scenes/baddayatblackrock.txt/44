<A>__{walks thoughtfully down street. he comes abreast of hotel.}
<L>__{exterior porch of hotel}
<A>__{where smith is still sitting. for a moment he watches macreedy speculatively, then...}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{mr. macreedy.}
<P>__{(reasonably, as}
<D>__{macreedy turns toward}
<P>__{him)}
<D>__{i'd like to ask you a few questions... as long as you're around...}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(walking up steps)}
<D>__{i'm around all right.}
<A>__{he stands facing smith on the porch, then...}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(with just a touch of wryness)}
<D>__{you probably know that miss brooks is no longer in the car rental business?}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(solemnly)}
<D>__{good. i wouldn't want to see that girl get into trouble...}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{you wouldn't?}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{...what with rental permits, gas rationing... you know what i mean.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{sure. i admire your sturdy sense of responsibility.}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(dismissively)}
<D>__{it's just, a girl like that has a future.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{let's talk about my future.}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(almost slyly)}
<D>__{do you have the time?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{i don't seem to be going any place.}
<A>__{he takes the other chair.}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{i hear you handle a jeep real well.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{i have a way with jeeps. a certain familiarity.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{i think i understand. you're an army man.}
<P>__{(looking at macreedy's stiff arm)}
<D>__{where'd you get it?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{italy.}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(sincerely)}
<D>__{tough. i tried to get in myself, the day after those rats bombed pearl harbor.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{what stopped you?}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{the physical. they wouldn't take me. the morning after pearl, i was the first man in line at marine recruiting in sand city. and they wouldn't take me.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{tough.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{what do you do in los angeles, mr. macreedy?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{i'm retired.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{you're a pretty young man...}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{you might say i was forced into retirement.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{what were you looking for in adobe flat?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{komako, like i told you. like you told me, he wasn't there.}
<A>__{smith laughs quietly.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{what's so funny?}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{nothing. it's just i don't believe you. i believe a man is as big as what he seeks. i believe you're a big man, mr. macreedy.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{flattery will get you nowhere.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{why would a man like you be looking for a lousy jap farmer?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{maybe i'm not so big.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{yes, you are.}
<P>__{(a beat; looking hard at macreedy)}
<D>__{i believe that a man is as big as the things that make him mad. nobody around here has been big enough to make you mad.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{what makes you mad, mr. smith?}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{me...? nothing in particular.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(bemused)}
<D>__{i see. you're a big man, too. only...}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{...the japanese make you mad...}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{that's different. after the sneak attack on pearl harbor... after bataan...}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{...and komako made you mad.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{it's the same thing.}
<P>__{(scoffing)}
<D>__{loyal japanese americans that's a laugh. they're mad dogs. look at corregidor, the death march.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{what did komako have to do with corregidor?}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{wasn't he a jap? look, macreedy, there's a law in this county against shooting dogs. but if i see a mad dog loose, i don't wait for him to bite me.}
<P>__{(exhales sharply,}
<D>__{shaking his head}
<P>__{with irritation)}
<D>__{i swear, you're beginning to make me mad.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{all strangers do.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{not all. some of 'em. when they come here snooping.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{snooping for what?}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{i mean, outsiders coming around, looking for something.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(pressing)}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{i don't know. people are always looking for something in this part of the west. to the historian, it's the "old west." to the book writers, it's the "wild west." to the businessmen, it's the "undeveloped west." they all say we're backward and poor, and i guess we are.}
<P>__{(snorts)}
<D>__{we don't even have enough water.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{but this place, to us, is our west.}
<P>__{(heatedly)}
<D>__{i just wish they'd leave us alone.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{leave you alone to do what?}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{i don't know what you mean.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{what happened to komako?}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{he went away, i told you. shortly after he left, a bunch of kids got fooling around out his place. they burned it down. it was one of those things you know how kids are.}
<A>__{macreedy laughs quietly.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{what's funny?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{nothing. only i don't believe you. any more than i believed you about the letters.}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{you don't seem to believe anything i say.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(vaguely)}
<D>__{yes, i do about businessmen, for instance. i think a businessman would be interested in adobe flat.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{all that land lying fallow. could be put to some use. like a graveyard.}
<P>__{(smith opens his mouth}
<D>__{to speak but macreedy}
<P>__{goes on)}
<D>__{a historian might be interested, too. because of the strange customs around here, such as burying cattle...}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{burying cattle...?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{something's buried out there.}
<A>__{he takes the wild flowers from his pocket, holding them in front of smith.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{see these wild flowers? that means a grave. i've seen it overseas. i figure it isn't a man's grave or someone would have marked it. sort of a mystery, isn't it?}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{sort of. maybe you can figure it out.}
<A>__{macreedy gets up, half turns to smith.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{maybe.}
<A>__{he starts down the steps.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{why not give it a whirl?}
<P>__{(macreedy turns)}
<D>__{it'll help you pass the time...}
<P>__{(continued; meaningfully)}
<D>__{...for a while.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{not interested. i got other things to do.}
<A>__{he turns and walks down the street.}
