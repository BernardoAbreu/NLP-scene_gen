<A>__{a trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit. in a few moments all is quiet. the muffled sounds of a distant officer giving orders finally fade. two floor panels suddenly pop up revealing han solo and luke. ben kenobi sticks his head out of a third locker.}

<D>__{boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.}
<C>__{han}

<C>__{ben}
<D>__{leave that to me!}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{damn fool. i knew that you were going to say that!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?}
