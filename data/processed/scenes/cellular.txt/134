<A>__{the darkness is oppressive. craig is pushed inside and pulls the hood off.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{goddamn it, what the hell are you people going to }
<C>__{jessica }
<D>__{craig?}
<A>__{craig stops dead, hearing the voice. scans the cobweb filled room, seeing nothing then from the depths of the shadows, jessica materializes looking haunted and lifeless as a ghost.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{jessica?}
<A>__{jessica races for the safety of craig's arms, but just as she's about to be embraced, greer steps forward and yanks jessica back by her hair. she squeals in pain.}
<C>__{craig }
<D>__{hey }
<A>__{craig moves to object, but oof! deason sends him gasping to the floor with a sledgehammer fist to the gut.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{no, don't hurt him!}
<A>__{jessica struggles and, with an annoyed shove, greer sends her spilling into craig. she hugs tightly against him. when craig gets his wind back, he comes to his knees and manages to croak out }
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{ricky...?}
<A>__{jessica nods gravely. he's here, too. craig looks at his wife's face, bruised and hurt, and tears rise in his eyes.}
<C>__{craig }
<D>__{oh, god, jess... what have they done to you?}
<A>__{but jessica won't let this moment be about pity.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{who are they, craig?}
<A>__{craig doesn't know what to say.}
<C>__{jessica }
<D>__{tell them, craig. tell them they have the wrong family. tell them they've made a mistake }
<A>__{but something in his eyes disagrees.}
<C>__{jessica }
<D>__{what?! what is it? .u craig this isn't a mistake, jess.}
<A>__{and that's all it takes for jessica's world to shatter. greek emerges from the shadows, startling them, and backhands craig's jaw with the butt of his gun.}
<C>__{greek}
<D>__{where is the disc now?}
<A>__{blood trickles from the corner of craig's mouth.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{you have to promise. if i give it to you... you'll let my family go.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{i will tell you what, you tell me where it is }
<P>__{(turns his gun on jessica)}
<D>__{ and i won't blow her brains all over you right now.}
<A>__{greer traces the barrel of the gun down jessica's cheek. craig looks utterly helpless.}
<C>__{greer }
<D>__{your call craig. it's an eighty five cent bullet to me.}
<A>__{greer lowers the gun to her neckline pulls her shirt lower... she pleads "no" at craig with her eyes, but he finally breaks.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{okay. enough, you win. but if anything }
<C>__{greer}
<P>__{(training gun on craig)}
<D>__{just shut up and talk.}
