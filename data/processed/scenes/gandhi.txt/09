<A>__{the armory hall the fort of lahore interior day silence. the camera is close as it crosses a table with legal documents. gradually we hear a muffled cough, whispers, shuffled papers, and it at last comes to a large close shot of general dyer. another angle. a commission of inquiry sits in the large armory hall of the old fort. dyer faces a panel of commissioners: lord hunter, presiding, mr. justice rankin, general barrow, a british civil servant, and an indian barrister. the commission functions like a public parliamentary committee little ceremony, no judicial robes, a small group of public and press, who sit on wooden chairs behind a barrier that isolates the commission's business. much of that public is english fellow officers and civilians. a government advocate (english) turns to face dyer.}
<C>__{advocate}
<D>__{general dyer, is it correct that you ordered your troops to fire at the thickest part of the crowd?}
<A>__{dyer glances woodenly at the panel a man in some shock at the consequences of what he assumed was an act worthy of praise.}
<C>__{dyer}
<P>__{(righteously)}
<D>__{that is so.}
<A>__{the advocate looks at him with a degree of disbelief more at his attitude than his statement.}
<C>__{advocate}
<D>__{one thousand five hundred and sixteen casualties with one thousand six hundred and fifty bullets.}
<A>__{a slight reaction from the public section. dyer's jaw tightens.}
<C>__{dyer}
<D>__{my intention was to inflict a lesson that would have an impact throughout all india.}
<A>__{he stares at the panel like a reasonable man making a reasonable pointerior the evasiveness, the only half buried embarrassment of their response only deepens his own withdrawal into himself.}
<C>__{indian barrister}
<D>__{general, had you been able to take in the armored car, would you have opened fire with the machine gun?}
<A>__{dyer thinks about it. then unashamedly }
<C>__{dyer}
<D>__{i think, probably yes.}
<A>__{a muted reaction from the public section. the indian barrister stares at him a moment, then simply lowers his eyes to his notes.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{general, did you realize there were children and women in the crowd?}
<C>__{dyer}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i did.}
<A>__{for the first time there is the hint of uncertainty in his manner.}
<C>__{advocate}
<D>__{but that was irrelevant to the point you were making?}
<C>__{dyer}
<D>__{that is correct.}
<A>__{there is just a tremor of distaste quickly suppressed among the panel. not so quickly in the public section.}
<C>__{advocate}
<D>__{could i ask you what provision you made for the wounded?}
<A>__{dyer looks at him quickly. the question is unexpected, even a little "clever." the officers listening clearly resent it.}
<C>__{dyer}
<P>__{(a moment, then firmly)}
<D>__{i was ready to help any who applied.}
<A>__{and that answer stops the advocate. he smiles dryly.}
<C>__{advocate}
<D>__{general... how does a child shot with a 3 0 3 enfield "apply" for help?}
<A>__{dyer faces him stonily, a seed of panic taking root deep in his gut. jallianwallah bagh exterior day quiet: the same silence as at the court of inquiry. the camera is panning slowly along a section of the wall. we are close and see the bullet holes, the patches of splashed blood, the scratches where fingers have dug at the surface of the wall to claw a path to safety... and finally the camera comes to a close shot of gandhi, matching that of dyer, whom we have just left. he is surveying the wall in the now empty park numbly, desolately. nehru stands a few feet away from him, his mood the same, the same benumbed grief and incredulity. resume the wall gandhi's point of view. the camera continues its pan bits of human hair matted in the dried blood, and the bullet ripped foliage, the well, trampled ground around it, little pieces of clothing. flies buzz around the debris. abstractedly, gandhi touches the bucket rope that lies across the surround. nehru has moved to the other side of the well. gandhi lifts his eyes to him...}
