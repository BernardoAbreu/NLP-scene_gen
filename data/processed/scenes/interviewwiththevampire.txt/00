<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{interior room night (san francisco)}
<A>__{a small bare room, illuminated only by the streetlight coming through the window. a hand presses a cassette into a recorder and fiddles with a small microphone. malloy sits over a table fiddling with the tape. he is young, half shaven, dressed in t shirt and jeans. he looks too louis, who stands by the window, looking out on the street, with his back to malloy. louis is dressed in an old fashioned suit.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{so you want me to tell you the story of my life...}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{that's what i do. i interview people. i collect lives. f.m. radio. f.f.r.c. i just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who }
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(quietly interrupting)}
<D>__{you'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. i've had a very unusual life.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{so much the better. i've got a pocket full of tapes.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you followed me here, didn't you?}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{saw you in the street outside. you seemed interesting. is this where you live?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{it's just a room...}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{so shall we begin?}
<P>__{(playfully, almost teasing)}
<D>__{what do you do?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i'm a vampire.}
<A>__{malloy laughs.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{see? i knew you were interesting. you mean this literally, i take it?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{absolutely. i was watching you watching me. i was waiting for you in that alleyway. and then you began to speak.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{well, what a lucky break for me.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{perhaps lucky for both of us.}
<A>__{still in shadow he turns from the window and approaches the table.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i will tell you my story. all of it. i'd like to do that very much.}
<A>__{malloy is uneasy as he studies the shadowy figure, fascinated but afraid.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{you were going to kill me? drink my blood?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{yes but you needn't worry about that now. things change.}
<A>__{louis stands opposite, hand on the chair. malloy is riveted.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{you believe this, don't you? that you're a vampire? you really think...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{we can't begin this way. let me turn on the light.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{but i thought vampires didn't like the light.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{we love it. i only wanted to prepare you.}
<A>__{louis pulls the chord of the overhead naked light bulb. louis' face appears inhumanly white, eyes glittering. inhuman or not alive. the effect is subtle, beautiful and ghastly.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{good god!}
<A>__{he struggles to suppress fear and understand.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{don't be frightened. i want this opportunity.}
<A>__{the light appears to go out by itself and suddenly louis is in the chair, dimly lit by the street light from the window. the cassette is turning.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{how did you do that?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{the same way you do it. a series of simple gestures. only i moved too fast for you to see. i'm flesh and blood, you see. but not human. i haven't been human for two hundred years.}
<A>__{malloy is speechless, frightened yet enthralled.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what can i do to put you at ease? shall we begin like david copperfield? i am born, i grow up. or shall we begin when i was born to darkness, as i call it. that's really where we should start, don't you think?}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{you're not lying to me, are you?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{why should i lie? 1791 was the year it happened. i was twenty four younger than you are now.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{but times were different then. i was a man at that age. the master of a large plantation just south of new orleans...}
