<L>__{interior disturbance ward late afternoon}
<A>__{as the aide locks the door behind them, the other aides lead bromden and mcmurphy toward a bench, where they unshackle them.}
<C>__{aide}
<P>__{(pointing to a bench)}
<D>__{wait over there...}
<A>__{the three aides go down the hall, leaving mcmurphy and bromden who sit and look at their new surroundings. there is a man sitting next to them. mcmurphy's pov the architecture is the same as the ward we left below, but it is the atmosphere that is different. a heaviness pervades all. heavily sedated patients sit isolated from each other. others stand shifting from one foot to the other, while others walk up and down the hallway, their locomotive powers not unlike that of parkinson's disease (caused by too much sedation). suddenly, one patient gets up, speaking very angrily, shouting incoherently at no one; he crosses the hall and enters a side room. an aide goes in after him. a long beat, then the aide comes out with the patient and gently leads him back to his seat, talking softly to the man. further down the hallway, a gurney is wheeled out of the east room with a patient lying on it, out cold; he is wheeled further down the hall to the men's dorms, where he is left to sleep it off. two aides come out of the est room and head in mcmurphy's direction, where one of the aides motions to the patient sitting next to mcmurpby.}
