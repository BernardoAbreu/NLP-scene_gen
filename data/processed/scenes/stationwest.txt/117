<L>__{exterior woods in back of warehouse}
<A>__{as haven leaves his horse in the brush and trees and then approaches the building. he finds a window in back, breaks it with a stone; then waits tensely to see if the sound has attracted any attention, gun in hand now. it doesn't. haven replaces the gun in his holster, opens the window and crawls inside.}
<L>__{interior warehouse night}
<A>__{haven surveys the piles of crates, boxes and equipment. he starts his search methodically and swiftly. suddenly a shaft of light comes from the front doors opened now by two men. haven shrinks back, drawing his gun. the men start to enter when pete's voice is heard.}
<C>__{pete's voice}
<D>__{where you guys goin'?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{you want them uniforms out, don't you?}
<C>__{pete's voice}
<D>__{i will tell you when.}
<A>__{the men turn and leave. haven relaxes. he goes back to work, pulls back a big canvas tarpaulin one of the men had approached, and there before him is revealed the army uniforms, stacked in neat piles. he looks and smiles grimly. outside is the sound of horses and more men arriving. haven goes slowly around the warehouse now, looking for something. at last he finds it: a can of kerosene. he takes it over to the uniforms, pours it liberally on them. at just this moment a figure appears at the door.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{what you think you're doin'?}
<A>__{haven lights a match and tosses it on the soaked bales of uniforms. they blaze up instantly. the man shoots as haven ducks away.}
