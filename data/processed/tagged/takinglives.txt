<A>__{laval reacts.}
<L>__{interior autopsy room day}
<A>__{gloved hands carefully remove the skull from a box. the medical examiner places the skull on an exam table and begins cleaning it. grace walks around the headless body. the wetsuit has been removed, the body has been autopsied. headless, skeletal hands, the legs are surprisingly well preserved. director gillet is tall, heavy, smoking a cigar. he's a cop's cop and all around nice guy.}
<C>__{director gillet}
<D>__{i can't tell you how excited we are to have you here.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you only have one victim. usually there's two or three by the time i get called in.}
<C>__{director gillet}
<D>__{this case made page one of the globe. the tabloids say there is a headhunter on the loose.}
<C>__{director gillet }
<D>__{the mayor wants closure. that's his vacation house they were building. i get calls from supervisors i didn't know i had.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you clear the mayor?}
<C>__{director gillet}
<D>__{we cleared the mayor. he read the article on you in newsweek and insisted we fly you up. the papers say two campers had a drunken fight and the loser lost his head.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{director gillet}
<D>__{i don't solve crimes anymore, i balance budgets.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{this was not a heat of the moment killing. and the victim was buried complete with head. the grave was five foot ten. the victim's height. with square corners. dug with a shovel the killer had the foresight to bring.}
<C>__{director gillet}
<D>__{thirty five detectives searched the area saturday. my investigators think you're a witch.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i've been called worse.}
<A>__{the medical examiner finds two small holes in the skull, waves the photographer over.}
<C>__{director gillet}
<D>__{jeez. look at that, looks like he got ice picked.}
<A>__{she simulates fangs with her hands, they match marks on the skull.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{no. a large canine did that. probably an old or sick timber wolf that couldn't hunt. it dug up the body and chewed off the head. it felt safe in the trees, away from the riverbank, away from the other wolves.}
<A>__{the medical examiner looks at a chewed vertebrate.}
<C>__{medical examiner}

<A>__{inspectors laval and reynaud enter. both give grace wary nods. inspector laval hands the medical examiner a paper bag marked human remains.}
<C>__{inspector laval}
<D>__{this was a meter from the skull. at soil level.}
<A>__{the medical examiner opens the bag. removes a wig. no, not a wig; someone's ponytail and leathered scalp. tangled with the hair is a braid of green nylon cord tied to two pieces of broomstick. the photographer snaps some shots. the medical examiner gingerly untangles the cord.}
<C>__{medical examiner}
<D>__{look at this.}
<A>__{grace crosses, grins. grace studies the cord, noting the intricate knots.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{bingo. that's your murder weapon.}
<C>__{inspector laval}
<D>__{it might be trash a camper left.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{no. look at it, braided parachute cord, two pieces of broom stick. you approach the victim from behind, loop it around his head and hold on for all your might. the more the victim struggles, the quicker he passes out. and now you have convenient handles to drag around two hundred pounds of dead kayaker.}
<C>__{inspector laval}
<D>__{that is a theory.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{that's exactly what it is. a theory. that evidence supports. when the suspect is in custody you can ask him yourself what happened and you won't need me. inspector.}
<A>__{laval bristles, he crosses to check his cell messages. gillet looks at grace, at the cord. turns to her quietly.}
<C>__{director gillet}
<D>__{laval and reynaud are my stars. very smart, very persistent investigators. on the street; they're magnificent.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i can see that director. you're lucky to have them.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{go ahead, director, say what you have to say.}
<C>__{director gillet}
<D>__{you're the expert. if you have any suggestions on how to proceed...}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{sure. a forensic anthropologist can draw the victim's face based on the skull. i know someone at quantico who can do it by tomorrow.}
<C>__{director gillet}
<D>__{we have people.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{call 'em. then show the results to everybody around who was selling outdoor goods two years ago. you have his initials; mrc, inside the wetsuit. the long hair is distinctive, someone may recognize him. it's a semi long shot.}
<C>__{director gillet}
<D>__{no, that's bread and butter detective work. thank you.}
<P>__{(checks his watch)}
<D>__{we should get upstairs.}
<A>__{they cross to the exit. director gillet barks orders in french at his two star inspectors.}

<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i had a case once where wild dogs had removed remains. councilman #2 so i can tell my people there isn't a headhunter running around the wilds of quebec?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{no headhunters, sir. however, a killer is out there. councilman #1 director gillet. do you have the victim identified?}
<C>__{director gillet}
<D>__{no name yet, sir. we have someone from the university recreating his face from the skull. councilman #1 why, after two years, has nobody reported him missing?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{he wasn't missed. he had no family, or moved often. he had the musculature of a serious outdoorsman. he spent a lot of time in his kayak. councilman #1 the big question is who killed him.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{always is, sir. i can give you a rough profile; white male, thirty to thirty four. has some college but no degree. neat in appearance. at least six feet tall. very intelligent. charming when necessary. he uses murder as a tool, probably in furtherance of a criminal endeavor. he's killed before and will again unless caught.}
<A>__{laval and reynaud write furiously. gillet is impressed. as are the councilmen.}
<D>__{councilman #1 we really appreciate the fbi sending you. when can we expect your report?}

<D>__{very solid time of death. two years ago.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{so before he died he got his paychecks, paid his taxes. patronized sporting goods stores. and had long spending gaps where he was enjoying the great outdoors. that pattern continues a year after his death. he gets some paychecks. rents an apartment. buys a three thousand dollar kayak. pays his taxes. dead and buried and still paying his taxes. then everything stops. last visa charge was to travelocity for a plane ticket to mexico city.}
