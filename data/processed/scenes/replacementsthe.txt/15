<L>__{interior o'neil's bedroom close on o'neil night}
<A>__{as he sleeps peacefully. the only sound is the hiss of his oxygen. then we hear ice cubes sloshing in a glass. o'neil opens his eyes and sees: jimmy mcginty, a handsome devil in his late sixties, wearing golf clothes and sipping the last dregs of a scotch rocks.}
<D>__{mcginty you look like shit.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{i'm dying, jimmy. mcginty you been dying for twenty years.}
<A>__{o'neil motions to the glass. jimmy pours three fingers from a glenlivet bottle and hands it to him.}
<D>__{mcginty that poof of a nurse of yours is gonna kick my ass if he catches you drinking.}
<A>__{o'neil removes his oxygen to sip his whiskey. he smiles as it goes down.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{gimme a butt. mcginty i quit.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{mcginty nods.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{you pussy. i want you to come back as head coach. i fired that asshole tilden today. mcginty i'm retired. and besides, you don't have a team. they all flew home in their jets to their castles.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{we're gonna finish the season anyway. all of us owners decided. we're gonna use replacement players. mcginty you're a bunch of greedy bastards, aren't you?}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{us, greedy?! what about the god damn players?! i got the highest payroll in the n.f.l. and they still want more! mcginty that's because you've been bottle feeding straight cash to these big babies for years.}
<A>__{o'neil sips his whiskey and calms down.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{no team owner in their right mind is gonna give back those t.v. revenues.}
<C>__{o'neil }
<D>__{all we promised fox was twenty two guys with a pulse every sunday. but think about it, jimmy. we got a great opportunity here! we got a chance to put a team on the field that plays the game just for the love of it. like we used to play it. mcginty we also used to play without face guards.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{jimmy, i'm really dying. the doctor says i will be gone by superbowl sunday. help me bring a winner back to d.c. you did it for me once before. you can do it again. mcginty listen: i golf once a week with the president of the united states. i walk my grandkids to school every day. i got a young wife who will fuck me any time i want, which frankly, isn't too often, but it's comforting to know it's there. i don't need it.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{come on. wouldn't it be fun? a bunch of poor nobodies who play to win instead of a bunch of bitchy millionaires? you can put it together, jimmy. player's love you. they always have.}
<A>__{mcginty pours more scotch and looks into the glass.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{tell me you're gonna do it. mcginty shut up, i'm thinking.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{okay. here's the deal: you let me recruit who i want, with no interference?}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{absolutely. mcginty i'm talking anybody i want. no exceptions. and no interference with my coaching, either, like you used to.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{sure, jimmy, sure. mcginty and one more thing: no more notre dame stories. you start telling me notre dame stories and i pull your plug personally. i swear to god.}
<A>__{o'neil smiles.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{deal.}
