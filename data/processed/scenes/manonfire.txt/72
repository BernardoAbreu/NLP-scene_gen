<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<C>__{pinta's voice}
<D>__{creasy!}
<A>__{creasy is on his feet, out the door in a heartbeat.}
<L>__{exterior side yard day}
<A>__{creasy dashes around just as the gutter drops on one side. pinta drops ten feet, jerks to a stop as the gutter stops, then drops the last twenty feet... ...landing in a hedge. creasy dashes over.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{pinta!}
<A>__{she's in a lot of pain, but moving her arms and head. frank's licking her face.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{it hurts.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{pinta}
<P>__{(short)}
<D>__{everywhere!}
<A>__{she puts her hands to the left side of her ribs. creasy carefully probes with his fingers. she winces.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{i don't think they're broken. anywhere else?}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{my ankle.}
<A>__{as maria huffs and puffs her way up.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{i'm going to get you out, okay?}
<A>__{pinta nods. creasy eases his arms under, around her, lifts her out as gently as possible. she disappears in his arms.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{oh, creasy...}
<A>__{and she bursts into tears. maria looks up at the thirty foot fall. begins to cross herself.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{it's okay. she's just scared.}
<A>__{creasy cradles her, pats her back. as pinta says his name like a mantra...}
