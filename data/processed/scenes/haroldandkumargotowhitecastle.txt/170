<L>__{interior white castle 7:45 am}
<A>__{harold and kumar have finished their meals. they both look full and satisfied. harold takes one last sip of his soda.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{oh...that hit the spot.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{it was the best meal of my life.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{mine too.}
<A>__{the two of them sit there, looking at all the empty containers and wrappers. after a long pause of silence, kumar speaks...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{dude, you know what? i think i may actually go to my interview today.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{seriously?}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{yeah. you know, my whole life i've been afraid being just another nerdy indian guy turned doctor. well, tonight got me thinking...}
<A>__{suddenly, harold notices a convertible parking outside the restaurant it's billy and j.d. with two women.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{there are far worse things in the world than being tagged for having a natural ability in medicine...}
<A>__{harold pretends to be listening to kumar but he is more focused on billy and j.d., who get out of the car with their women and start walking towards the front door.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{like having boils all over your face. or dealing with the shit those black guys had to go through.}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(not paying attention)}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{besides, i have to admit, it felt pretty cool saving that guy's life last night. somewhere between that, getting yelled at by my dad, and seeing neil patrick harris, i realized that i've always wanted to be a doctor i've just been too scared to admit it.}
<A>__{kumar sees that harold isn't paying attention...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{hey, rold, are you listening to me? i'm having a major epiphany here.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{i will be right back...}
<A>__{at that moment, billy and j.d. walk in the restaurant with their women, zoe and tracy, respectively. tracy looks like some bimbo slut that j.d. picked up at a strip club. zoe, on the other hand, has a sweet renee zellweger quality about her. she and billy are the perfect hollywood couple...}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{hey, billy you paying for this or what?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i will be there in a second...}
<A>__{j.d. and tracy check out the menu. billy takes zoe aside whatever their story is, it seems to have reached the "you complete me" moment...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{look, i have to admit something to you. at the start of last night, all i really cared about was getting some. but then i met you, zoe. you're so different from all the other women i've ever met. you're smart, funny, artistic. i guess what i'm trying to say is...}
<C>__{harold }
<D>__{what the fuck is going on here?}
<A>__{billy turns around and sees harold...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{harold? what are you...?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{never mind me. what are you doing here? i thought you and j.d. were busy all night with "clients." isn't that why i had to do your work?}
<A>__{j.d. hears the commotion and turns around...}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{hey! what the hell is going on here?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{back off, cock boy! what i have to say to him goes double for you!}
<A>__{kumar sees what's going on he can't believe it.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{cock boy? i'm sorry, but did you just call me "cock boy?"}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{yeah, you know i did. you're just stalling because you're not quick enough to think of a comeback.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{oh, i'm not quick enough?}
<P>__{(to billy)}
<D>__{he thinks i'm not quick enough.}
<P>__{(to harold)}
<D>__{well, i got news for you...}
<P>__{(long beat, thinking)}
<D>__{i am quick enough...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{...cock boy!}
<A>__{j.d. is embarrassed. billy tries to placate the situation.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{listen harry...}
<C>__{j.d.}
<P>__{(to billy)}
<D>__{don't even bother with him. we'll just tell berenson later...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{tell him what? that i'm your work horse! that you guys think you can just party all weekend and leave all your work to the quiet asian guy in your office! huh?}
<A>__{j.d. is stunned. now he's a little nervous.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{no, no you don't understand...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{no, you don't understand. i'm not doing your work anymore.}
<C>__{harold }
<D>__{and if either one of you douchebags ever tries to pull this shit again, i will go to berenson and tell him what's really going on.}
<A>__{harold notices traci and zoe listening...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{and i will tell everyone in the office how you both caught gonorrhea from that whore.}
<A>__{traci and zoe hear this and are freaked out. they slowly back away from billy and j.d....}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{now, if you'll excuse me, i have to get going. see you on monday.}
<A>__{harold leaves the restaurant. kumar follows. billy and j.d. are left embarrassed and in shock.}
