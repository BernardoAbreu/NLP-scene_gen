<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{meg and sarah come out of sarah's bedroom just as raoul reaches the top of the stairs at the other end. they're cut off. meg freezes, staring at the hulking ski masked figure at the end of the hallway. she thinks, no idea what to do for a second. she looks frantically to her right the bathroom, dead end. she looks to her left. the elevator. she yanks open the elevator door, throws aside the gate, and races inside with sarah. raoul takes off down the hall, lunging for the elevator.}
