<A>__{max does this, ordell pats him down.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{jackie didn't trust melanie. she'd already tried to get jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. what she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{lift up your pant leg. you help her?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{all i did was walk out with it.}

<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{that i gotta see.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{she still is. she doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{have her bring the money here.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{it's in the safe. she can't get at it.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{call her, tell her the combination.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i'm telling you, you got her spooked. she won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{you expect me to just walk in there?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{if she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. when you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. that scares her more than anything.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{that's why she's givin' up my money huh? not that bullshit about melanie. i didn't trust her ass neither, but i knew how to handle her. she was my blonde headed little surfer gal. i fuckin' told louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. she's at your office.}
