<D>__{lumpy! help me!}
<A>__{lumpy desperately tries to reach choy's hand ... but choy slips away into the abyss. kong roars with frustration, and tosses the entire log into the chasm! quick image: denham, preston, jack, jimmy and lumpy gripping the log as it falls! quick image: preston thrown off the log halfway down ... he manages to grab onto a rocky shelf. angle on: preston is nearest to the far bank ... he leaps, and manages to catch hold of some hanging vines, hauling himself up to safety. angle on: the log plummets into a web of vines, which arrest its fall and sends it flipping end on end, throwing the men clear into mid air... denham, jack and lumpy land in soft mud which cushions the impact of the landing.}
