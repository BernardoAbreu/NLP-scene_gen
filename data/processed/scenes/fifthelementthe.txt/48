<L>__{interior laboratory}
<A>__{the two enter a cylindrical laboratory. there is a huge glass turbine in the middle with the metal glove inside. a dna chain scrolls on the computer screen.}
<C>__{mactilburgh}
<P>__{(rather fascinated)}
<D>__{the compositional elements of his dna chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. his knowledge is probably limitless..}
<C>__{munro}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{is there any danger? some kind of virus?}
<C>__{mactilburgh}
<D>__{we put it through the cellular hygiene detector. the cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.}
<A>__{munro hesitates a moment. then he sighs and uses his personal key to open the self destruct box.}
<C>__{munro}
<D>__{ok, go ahead! but mr. perfect better be polite... otherwise i turn him into cat food.}
<A>__{mactilburgh starts the operation rolling as munro puts his hand on the sell destruct button, ready to use it. thousands of cells form in the heart of the generator, an assemblage of dna elements. then the cells move down a tube, like a fluid, and gather in an imprint of a human body. step by step bones are reconstructed, then the nervous and muscular systems. whole veins wrap around the muscles. an entire body is reconstructing before our very eyes.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{three seconds to ultra violet protection.}
<A>__{a shield comes over the reconstructing body and makes it invisible.}
<C>__{mactilburgh}
<P>__{(to munro)}
<D>__{...this is the crucial phase, the reconstruction of pigment. cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. that means growing skin. clever, eh?}
<C>__{munro}
<P>__{(disgusted)}
<D>__{wonderful!}
<A>__{the meter slows, drops to zero.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{... end of reconstruction, beginning of reanimation .}
<A>__{a whoosh of air in the glass chamber. captain munro has his hand on the self destruct button, ready to destroy the being that has barely been reborn.}
<C>__{mactilburgh}
<P>__{(pushing a button)}
<D>__{activate life support system.}
<A>__{an electrical discharge fills the glass chamber causing the body inside to jerk. after a few moments of silence, the sound of a heartbeat fills the room over the loudspeaker.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{life support system activated.}
<A>__{the supreme being is alive once again.}
<C>__{mactilburgh}
<D>__{remove the shield.}
<A>__{the assistant automatically removes the ultra violet shield which slowly reveals... a woman... nude... young... and very beautiful. munro stands there gaping. not quite his vision of the supreme being. mactilburgh glances at munro and gently pushes his hand away from the self destruct button.}
<C>__{mactilburgh}
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{i told you ... perfect!}
<A>__{munro is hypnotized by the girl's beauty.}
<C>__{munro}
<D>__{...i'd, uh , like to get a few pictures for the}
<A>__{archives}
<D>__{before she wakes up.}
<A>__{mactilburgh looks at him with a grin. a remote control camera approaches the girl's face, a flash goes off. blinded by the flash, the girl jumps and screams. she cowers in a corner, shaking from the cold, darting eyes everywhere looking for the case she was holding.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(very angry)}
<D>__{ouacra cocha o dayodomo binay ouacra mo cocha ferji akba ligounai makta keratapla. tokemata tokemata! seno santonoi aypa! minoi ay cheba! givomana seno!}
<C>__{munro}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{what's she saying?}
<C>__{mactilburgh}
<P>__{(to his assistant)}
<D>__{activate the phonic detector.}
<A>__{the girl kicks the window repeatedly.}
<C>__{mactilburgh}
<D>__{and give her a light sedative... and something to wear!}
<A>__{the assistant hits a button. a pile of clothes drops out of a trapdoor in the ceiling. she snatches up the clothes angrily and dresses quickly. munro draws closer to the glass window. he watches her dress with undisguised pleasure.}
<C>__{munro}
<P>__{(to mactilburgh)}
<D>__{this thing solid?}
<C>__{mactilburgh}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{an elephant couldn't crack it.}
<A>__{the girl finishes dressing.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{teno akta chataman assin omekta!}
<A>__{munro smiles safely behind his plate glass window.}
<C>__{munro}
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{you're gonna have to learn to communicate better than that angel if you want out.}
<A>__{munro dangles the key on a chain that will let her out. the girl rams her fist right through the window. she grabs the key and yanks it. the chain snaps tight and munro slams into the window knocking himself out. the girl puts her hand through the window again, unlocks the chamber and steps out. she is still bit wobbly on her legs. two guards try to grab her. she sends them flying across the room. mactilburgh is most impressed. he sets off a general alarm.}
