<L>__{ext street, near black sabbath clubhouse, moments later}
<A>__{a run down street in inglewood. the black sabbath clubhouse is a low lying pool hall bar with a crude hand painted sign reading beer pool darts. motorcycles are parked out front. roller dolly from alongside chev’s car at high speed, break off and follow inside as chev parks haphazardly, rushes out and busts into the joint ...}
<L>__{interior black sabbath clubhouse, continuous}
<A>__{the continuous roller dolly move takes us inside and keeps going. eight or ten brothers, some wearing motorcycle leathers, are scattered around the room, shooting stick, drinking, etc. chev barges in, drawing a glok .45 from his coat and goes straight at orlando black, hip, 30’s, better dressed than the others who is at the center of a group of}
<B>__{badasses.}
<A>__{before anyone has time to react chev has the gun pressed into orlando’s forehead and is pushing him through the place into the bathroom. everyone scatters and takes cover at the site of the glok; firearms appear. chev locks the door, slams orlando against the far wall and starts circling around him with the gun beaded on orlando’s forehead.}
<C>__{chev}
<P>__{(out of his mind)}
<D>__{where’s verona!!}
<C>__{orlando}
<P>__{(flipping out)}
<D>__{it’s cool it’s cool it’s cool!}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{talk!!}
<A>__{chev cocks the gun.}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{i’m talking! what are we talking about?}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{don’t fuck with me!!}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{ok, nobody’s fucking with you, just calm down ...}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{don’t tell me to calm down motherfucker!}
<A>__{there’s banging on the door. a biker yells from outside.}
<C>__{biker }
<D>__{o land o! what’s up!}
<C>__{orlando}
<P>__{(calling back)}
<D>__{there’s a white man with a gun in here, i would prefer that he not cap my ass, so please refrain from any sudden ass bullshit!}
<P>__{(to chev)}
<D>__{now you see that? i’m trying to help you here.}
<A>__{chev starts to chill out.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{look, i got to find ricky verona ...}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{why would i know where ... ?}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{... right, i know, you don’t know where he is, but you’re going to tell me where he is, or i’m going to blow your brains into that toilet!!}
<A>__{the door busts open and a half dozen gun wielding brothers crowd into the tiny room. total mad chaos ensues, chev, orlando and the brothers packed in like sardines, everyone pointing guns at every one else’s head, shoving each other back and forth, everyone screaming. the situation teeters at the very edge of an explosion of bloody violence. finally orlando cuts through the din with a booming voice.}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{the white man is cool! the white man is cool!}
<A>__{silence just the sound of chev’s heartbeat, pumping.}
<P>__{orlando (cont’d) (calmly)}
<D>__{can we all just get along? can we?}
<A>__{beat. chev’s gun is still trained on orlando’s head.}
<P>__{orlando (cont’d)}
<D>__{now chevy here has something he would like to discuss. so we are going to discuss it. in a civilized manner. chevy? i believe you had a question, or some point you were trying to make?}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{where’s verona.}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{ok. i am not affiliated with ricky verona.}
<C>__{chev}
<P>__{(starting to lose it again)}
<D>__{you pulled the anselmo job together, don’t try to bullshit me ...}
<A>__{he presses closer to orlando ... the brothers bristle ... the situation is close to blowing up again.}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{easy ... easy ... now things are beginning to clarify ... you see how that works? how discussion can lead to clarity?}
<A>__{chev is running out of patience.}
<P>__{orlando (cont’d)}
<D>__{clearly you are operating under a false pretense. ricky verona and myself did not “pull the anselmo job together.” in fact, ricky verona fucked me on the anselmo job. in fact, ricky verona owes me seventy five hunna dollars.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{that’s not how i heard it.}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{but that’s the way it is. that’s the way it is. so you see, i don’t know where ricky verona is. because if i knew where he is, i would probably be there right now, beating his gucci ass down.}
<A>__{standoff. chev holds the gun with an unsteady hand, studying orlando’s eyes, evaluating. then, as much from exhaustion as from a sense that he’s telling the truth, he lets his gun hand drop.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{alright.}
<A>__{the room lets out a collective exhale. the brothers mutter amongst themselves damn right you better put that shit away, crazy bitch ass mother ...}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{thank you. that’s what i’m talking about. that resembles civility.}
<B>__{lub dub ... lub dub ... lub ... dub}
<A>__{chev begins to fade again. he slumps back, looking as though he might pass out. one of the brothers catches him, holds him up and shoves him away.}
<P>__{orlando (cont’d)}
<D>__{shit dude, what’s the matter with you?}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{forget it. i just gotta find ricky verona, that little bitch ...}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{i understand that. you’ve made that point abundantly clear to all of us.}
<A>__{he takes pity on him chev really looks like shit. a few of the brothers lose interest, begin to filter out of the room.}
<P>__{orlando (cont’d)}
<D>__{now what can i do to help you?}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{look, just give me some coke, ok? you got any coke?}
<A>__{orlando gives him the look.}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{ok, now you’re insulting me.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{come on, man, i know you got coke.}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{you think every brother is carrying, is that it?}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{come on, i don’t have time for this, just give me something ... i’m really dying here ...}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{i can see that.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{no. you don’t understand, i’m really fucking dying ... if i don’t ...}
<P>__{(losing it again)}
<D>__{may i just have some coke, please?}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{so this is medicinal use coke, that’s what you’re telling me.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{that’s right.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{you got something for me, or what?}
<A>__{chev shoves his gun into his belt, pulls out a wad of tens, tosses it into the sink. he’s visibly fading. orlando takes a quick look over the wad, pulls a little plastic bag out of his vest pocket, tosses it to chev. the bag hits chev square in the forehead, hits sweat and sticks. chev reaches for it lamely it slides off and lands on the floor. his reflexes are not the best at this pointerior chev collapses to his knees, breaks it open and snorts it right out of the bag like a pig on his elbows and knees. the brothers find this hilarious. orlando shakes his head in disgust.}
<P>__{orlando (cont’d)}
<D>__{chevy ... come on, man...}
<A>__{we hear chev’s heart rate start to build, increase in volume. suddenly he pops up to his feet, almost slips and falls, steadies himself. a new man.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{ok, that’s good. that’s good.}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{oh that’s good, right?}
<A>__{chev pounds rhythmically on chest, keeping time with his beating heart.}
<P>__{orlando (cont’d)}
<D>__{why you looking for verona anyway?}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{seems like some chinese assholes hired him to kill me...}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{ah, so this is about the don kim situation.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{what do you know about it?}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{i know you pulled the trigger.}
<C>__{chev}
<P>__{(flipping out)}
<D>__{of course i pulled the trigger! why wouldn’t i pull the trigger?!}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{o...kay...}
<A>__{abruptly, chev’s heart stops... his eyes go wide he waits for it...}
<B>__{lub...}
<A>__{... waiting...}
<B>__{dub.}
<A>__{... and then it starts up again, slow, erratic. chev is ghost}
<B>__{white.}
<P>__{orlando (cont’d)}
<D>__{whoa, chelios. you good, man?}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{this shit’s not working.}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{beg your pardon?}
<A>__{chev swoons, close to blacking out.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{i think i know what i have to do.}
<C>__{orlando}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{well, a man’s got to do what a man’s got to do.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{uhh... what exactly is it that you got to do?}
<A>__{chev snaps to his senses.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{got to kick... some black... ass.}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{chev turns to the biggest, meanest looking brother in the room, pats him on the chest in a mock friendly way, then, without warning, slams his head forward into the brother’s face, knocking him backwards into the hallway, sending all the other brothers sprawling like tenpins.}
<C>__{orlando }
<D>__{there he goes again.}
<A>__{chev has a pool cue in his hands. he moves out into the hallway, eyes wild. sound: chev’s heartbeat starts to rev up.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{alright ... who wants white meat?}
<A>__{all hell breaks loose.}
