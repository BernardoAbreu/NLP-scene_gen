<C>__{rose}
<D>__{you mean a farm?}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{no, no, not exactly. it isn't a farm in the sense that it's a farm. not at all. it's a... dairy establishment. you'll like it! i'm sure you'll like it because it's so... peaceful!}
<A>__{rose bows her head and begins crying.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{honey, rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. now i don't think }
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{just a minute, rose, you don't understand. this isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. a neighbor of cousin hop's, i talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! stop crying, rose! do you hear me? stop crying, it's ideal!}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{i don't know how you can call it ideal don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{i don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! she can't stay in this house forever! i fired her, damn it!}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{it sounds like a farm to me. calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! it's settled! and i must say we've been more than fair to you, rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!}
<A>__{rose sits head bowed at the kitchen table.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i'm not cryin' because of me, i'm cryin' because of somebody else.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(stops in mid air, so to speak)}
<D>__{what?}
