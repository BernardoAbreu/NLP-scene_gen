<L>__{interior vern's apartment door day}
<A>__{the door opens. and eddie is taken aback. vern has been beaten up. really worked over. his lip is split, his face puffy and bruised. his right hand is bandaged.}
<C>__{vern}
<D>__{well, that was fast.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{what hap }
<C>__{vern}
<D>__{don't ask.}
<A>__{leaving the door open, vern turns around and motions at eddie with his left hand to come in. the place is all mismatched antique furniture the possessions of someone who collected once, with enthusiasm, but who's letting it all go to hell. vern sits, keeping his injured arm elevated.}
<C>__{vern }
<D>__{so, eddie. i guess you're interested after all.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{yeah. that stuff's amazing.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{it works better if you're already smart.}
<A>__{eddie can't get over how bad vernon looks.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{vern }
<C>__{vern}
<D>__{you don't want to know.}
<A>__{and eddie wants the drug more than he wants to know what happened.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{what's... um... what's it called?}
<C>__{vern}
<D>__{it doesn't have a street name yet, because it doesn't have a street profile. and that's the way we want it to stay. the boys in the kitchen are calling it mdt 48.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{"the boys in the kitchen...?" vern, that doesn't sound fda approved.}
<C>__{vern}
<D>__{"fda approved," that's a laugh. did you really believe that shit?}
<A>__{eddie stares at vern as he pours himself a coffee.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{okay, so what did we have here? some unknown, untested, possibly dangerous drug scammed out of some unidentified lab somewhere, given to me by a highly unreliable guy i hadn't seen in years.}
<C>__{vern}
<D>__{so you want some more of it?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{yes. definitely.}
<A>__{vern chuckles. he knew it.}
<C>__{vern}
<D>__{we'll talk about it. but first maybe you can do me a little favor.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{uh... sure.}
<A>__{eddie wants to get on with it and get out of there, but vern clearly has him by the balls.}
<C>__{vern}
<D>__{you can see, i'm in no shape to go out right now. will you hop down to the dry cleaners and get my suit? and maybe pick me up a little breakfast...?}
<A>__{eddie sighs. vern tosses him a set of keys.}
