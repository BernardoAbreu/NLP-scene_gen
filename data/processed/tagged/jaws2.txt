<A>__{attacking. missing brody, who hauls himself up out of the way in life or death spasm. the great jaws close, fastening onto the thick cable. shaking it. the cable resists for a moment, then splits, layers or insulation and armor crack open, the jaws clamp harder 20,000 tons of pressure then the live copper core is reached. zap!}
<B>__{the shark}
<A>__{dying. leaping and convulsing as hundreds of thousands of volts surge through its body, grounded in the salt sea. hot white fire shimmers like a halo, the fish smokes and stinks, sputters, and dies.}
<B>__{brody}
<A>__{watching, cowering on the rubber raft to which he fell when the shark hit the cable. it's strangely silent. the lights on cable junction flicker and die as circuit breakers shut down the mains, protecting the line. only the boat's worklights provide light now.}

<D>__{sean?}
<A>__{no answer. water lapping at the rocks, some kids sobbing quietly. brody listlessly paddles towards the wreckage of the raft, expecting the worst...}

<A>__{timmy's doughdish, where we last saw sean. there's a scrabbling from inside, and sean appears, soaked, from under the seat where he'd fallen.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{dad?}
<A>__{brody moves toward him, holds out his arms, taking sean onto his raft. they paddle back towards the rocks.}
<B>__{the island}
<A>__{with the kids clinging like drowned rats to the rocks; they're wet, scared, exhausted, but safe. sean hugs his daddy as they step onto land.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{they made me go with them.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{sure they did...}
<A>__{he kisses the damp forehead.}

<A>__{a crowd of worried parents and adults, ellen and hendricks in the forefront, are staring towards the harbor mouth. it's dawn and the sun is rising. they see something, a cheer goes up.}
<B>__{angle on the water}
<A>__{a big coast guard cutter is steaming into the harbor, a little group of survivors on the foredeck.}
