<L>__{exterior wasteland dawn}
<A>__{the sun rises out of the east. and out of the sun comes the fleet of armored vehicles. racing side by side down the road. the lead vehicle comes to a halt. a door opens and redridge gets out. more armed men emerge from the other vehicles and follow him as he marches into the wasteland by the roadside. the dead brigands are splayed out in the dirt where eli slew them. a flock of buzzards is picking their bones clean.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{he's been here.}
<A>__{redridge looks at the footprints in the dirt headed from the bodies and back onto the road. two sets of tracks.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{the girl's with him.}
<A>__{he moves back to the cars.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{move out!}
<A>__{the other men hold for a moment, still looking at the half eaten bodies in the dirt. redridge turns back.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{i said move out!}
<C>__{carnegie gunman}
<D>__{i heard this guy's protected somehow, some... power from up above. that there ain't nothing on this earth can touch him.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{he's just a man. you put a bullet in him, he'll go down like any other. i don't want to hear no more of this superstitious horseshit!}
<A>__{hesitantly, they make their way back to the vehicles. the cars gun their engines and move on down the road, past the abandoned chevron station. dust pluming in their wake.}
