<A>__{moonlight filters down through the foliage of massive trees, showing as shafts in the swirling night mists. this is one of the most primeval forests on the planet, a place of violent growth and death filled shadows. massive tree roots grip the earth, entwined with vines that climb swaying into the vaulted canopy above. water drips constantly. and life is everywhere. furtive. timeless. churning in the shallow pools, under the bark, in the sweating fruit... leaping through the matted foliage above. a figure rises behind a rotting log, like a being from interstellar space. rambo removes his goggles and headset, then shrugs out of his chute harness. he looks around slowly. taking it in.}
