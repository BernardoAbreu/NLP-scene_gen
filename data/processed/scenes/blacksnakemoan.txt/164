<L>__{interior lazarus' home kitchen night}
<A>__{rae watches with intense curiosity as laz tunes his guitar, sitting at the table.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<P>__{(takes another drink)}
<D>__{ain't played 'fore nobody in years.}
<A>__{laz slides his calloused fingers across the strings, spurring the old guitar into an impressive wail. rae grips the chair.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<P>__{(plays as he remembers)}
<D>__{funny how a sound just speak to ya heart.}
<A>__{a haunting slide guitar riff barks. rae has a physical reaction to the music. she is fascinated and fearful.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{wanted me some kids. a whole mess of 'em. but rose, my wife... chil'ren was for another time.}
<P>__{(takes a drink)}
<D>__{they's this one spring... i saw a change in her. her breasts start swellin' up. come a few mornings i hear her heavin' in the bathroom. i seen it with women before. i knew.}
<A>__{laz thinks for a moment. continues playing.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{come a day, rose say she had to go visit her folks in jackson. didn't want me to come... so i stayed put.}
<P>__{(remembers)}
<D>__{when she come back...}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{they talk about a woman havin' that glow. couldn't see it no more. she... took it away. cut it out.}
<A>__{the guitar's song turns dark. laz slides his fingers up the guitar strings, lingering on low growns.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{one night... while she sleepin'. held a pillow in my hands. i could see myself killin' her. what evil in my heart make me wanna kill her, i don't know? it's that voice in me. each time i think it's gone, he come howlin' back. devil or no, i don't know. but i am a haunted man.}
<A>__{fear spreads across rae's face. laz is talking about something all too familiar.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{calls me when i'm ailing. when i can't find my home, lost in the pines. i calls it the black snake moan.}
<P>__{(he closes his eyes and sings)}
<D>__{mm mm... got no momma now.mm mm... got no momma now.it's over late last night, don't need no momma now.}
<A>__{laz stops. he sways back and forth with his eyes closed. rae hears the swell of the cicadas. her eyes dart to the front door as the familiar creek of footsteps are heard.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{sing, lazarus.}
<P>__{(kneels next to him in fear)}
<D>__{please keep singin'.}
<A>__{the door swings open. a white calloused hand appears around rae's mouth. she gasps in terror, clutching laz's leg. the white hand is gone. tears come to her. she trembles as laz sings.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{mm mm... black snake crawlin' in my room.mm mm... black snake crawlin' in my room.some pretty momma better come and get this black snake soon.}
<A>__{rae rests her head against his knee.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{black snake is evil, black snake is all i see.black snake is evil, black snake is all i see.woke up this mornin', black snake moved in on me.}
<A>__{laz concludes the song. rae raises up to her knees, facing laz. tears have run down his dried face. he opens his eyes.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{my life is gone. only life i was livin'. and i lost it.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{i'm here with you.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{i had love in my heart. and i gave it to one woman. and she gone now.}
<P>__{(his lip quivers)}
<D>__{where am i gonna put all this love?}
<A>__{rae gently touches his cheek. the wind picks up outside.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{you can give it to me.}
<A>__{rae kisses laz. he is motionless at first, allowing it to happen. his hand moves from the neck of his guitar to the bend in her neck. the passion intensifies as they squeeze the guitar between them. laz pulls his lips away and holds her head in his hands. they are so close, they are breathing into each other's mouths.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{you can't start this and not finish. not with me.}
<P>__{(kisses him)}
<D>__{please...}
<A>__{the guitar clangs to the floor as laz lifts rae in his arms. they kiss, ravenous for each other. he knocks up against the side table, causing his bible to fall to the floor, face up and open. the wind pushes the front door open, slamming it hard against the wall. they turn together, kissing, laz slowly spinning with rae in his arms. but laz is soon distracted by the pages of his bible fluttering on the floor. the wind is blowing the pages, turning them with an unseen hand.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{wait... i gotta stop...}
<P>__{(rae's kisses get more aggressive)}
<D>__{rae stop...}
<P>__{(she can't hear, the burning has her)}
<D>__{dammit, rae... get off!}
<A>__{it takes a considerable effort to pull rae away. she falls to the floor, dizzy and sucking in air.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{this ain't the way for me. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{rae is struggling for breath. she desperately grabs at laz.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{not gonna lie to you, laz...}
<P>__{(labored breath)}
<D>__{this one's a doozy. i don't think... i don't think i can stop this.}
<A>__{her eyes roll back briefly, almost losing consciousness. laz catches her and holds her tightly.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{tell me what to do.}
<C>__{rae}
<P>__{(barely able to speak)}
<D>__{the... chain helps.}
<A>__{laz grips the chain and wraps it around rae. as the burning increases. laz holds rae tight across his lap, his back up against the radiator.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{i seen a man die. he couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{you just havin' a fit. you ain't goin' nowhere.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{he told me... get help. i just stood there and watched him... i watched him die, laz. oh god! goddammit!}
<A>__{her legs itch like they are covered in ants. the wave is hitting her hard. laz holds her face up to him.}
<C>__{rae}
<P>__{(like a little girl)}
<D>__{oh, laz... he hurt me. he... hurt me so many times.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{no one's gonna hurt you no more.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{you think god forgives people like that?}
<P>__{(crying like a child)}
<D>__{you think god forgives people like me?}
<A>__{suddenly aware of the rising burn, rae grits her teeth.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{hold me. oh god...}
<A>__{rae turns away as laz holds her head in his lap. she bites down on his middle finger as his hand moves over her mouth. she is gasping, screaming into his hand. it hits. laz holds her. rae's open mouth quivers as the sensation peaks. her shoulders slump, her chest vibrates. she is crying softly.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{we'll just stay here. wait till it passes.}
<A>__{the pages of the bible flip to the final pages in the wind.}
