<L>__{interior loft day}
<A>__{molly is sitting on the couch in the middle of the loft surrounded by friends and well wishers. a young girl, her niece, cuddles in her lap. people are eating and milling around. slowly the camera begins to pan. it ends on sam, standing alone in a corner. in the midst of all the activity he is lost and alone.}
<T>__{fade to black:}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{raw clay on a potter's wheel spins hypnotically, sensuously. molly's wet hands press in, shaping it, molding it. a bowl begins to appear. the camera pulls back and reveals sam. he is sitting on the floor behind her, knees pressed to his chest, rocking aimlessly. molly looks away from the bowl she is forming. it distorts and bends. angry, she digs her finger into it. the bowl disintegrates. tears form in her eyes. frank jumps up on the bench beside her. molly stares sadly around the room. quietly, she begins talking to herself, to the air.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{oh god, sam...}
<A>__{sam looks up.}
<C>__{molly}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i picked up your shirts this morning. i don't know why. mr. reynolds said to tell you hello. i broke into tears. it's so hard...}
<A>__{sam walks over to molly. desperate for contact, he reaches out to touch her cheek, but then hesitates and pulls back.}
<C>__{molly}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i think about you every minute. it's like you're still here, like i can feel you, sam.}
<A>__{he stares at her, hoping, wondering.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i am here, moll. i am.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{suddenly, as if hearing sam's voice, the cat begins to hiss. molly spins around. the cat scans the room. unexpectedly, sam's and the cat's eyes meet... with a wild screech, the cat jumps from the bench and takes off running. sam recoils. molly stands up.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{frank, what's wrong? frank?}
<A>__{the cat is nowhere to be seen. all of a sudden, molly freezes. sam is standing right beside her. it is almost as though she senses his presence.}
<C>__{molly}
<P>__{(continuing; whispering)}
<D>__{sam?}
<A>__{she holds very still for a moment. sam watches breathlessly, loving her, wanting her. then quietly, hopefully, he reaches out. it is a useless gesture. in a moment of great poignancy, molly shakes her head and walks right through him. he remains in the frame, alone.}
