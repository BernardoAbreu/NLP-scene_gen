<B>__{while later}
<A>__{sheldon and nora stand at the crowded counter at nathan's. sheldon ravenously eats his sloppily garnished, oddly colored hot dog. nora winces as she watches him.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<P>__{(with full mouth)}
<D>__{soy dogs... never thought i'd live to see the day. organic, rich in natural protein, and nobody gets killed. although i do feel bad for the beans. just kidding. sure you don't want one?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{believe it or not, no.}
<A>__{he takes another bite.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{so anyway, like i was saying, people always tell me, 'you gotta network, sheldon... you gotta sell yourself... or you'll be playing the drug clinics and shopping centers the rest of your life.' and you know what i tell 'em?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i haven't the foggiest.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i tell 'em, it's not about the old handshake and back slap game. it's not about adding fuel to the shlock machine. it's about doing good work. having integrity. making people happy and delivering a positive message. foundations are built with concrete, not plaster of paris!}
<A>__{he pulls the stained, misshapen smoochy head from the shopping bag.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{this is concrete! this is integrity!}
<C>__{nora}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{i can see that.}
<A>__{sheldon realizes his voice was getting too loud.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{sorry. as you can imagine, living by your convictions can be a little stressful at times.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{we all have our cross to bear.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{see, i was raised by my grandfather, and grandpop paved driveways for a living...}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{are we going into a story?}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{thing is, he didn't really pave them. just covered them with black painterior of course, once the first rain came along, people realized they'd been swindled. i vowed to myself back then that i'd never make a living through deception. never. whadda ya think of them apples?}
<A>__{nora looks glassy eyed. she takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{the reason i'm here today, mr. mopes, as fate would have it, kidnet is currently looking for a performer with... convictions. and integrity. someone like...}
<A>__{she almost chokes on the word.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{... yourself.}
<A>__{sheldon laughs.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{yeah, right. got any more jokes?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i don't think i could top that one.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{hold the phone. you're telling me that kidnet is finally ready to do a show of smoochy quality? of smoochy caliber?}
<C>__{nora}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{yes... i believe we're ready to push ourselves to that level.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i knew this day would come! after all these years i finally meet someone in the business who gets what i do. who gets what i'm all about. you get me, don't you, nora?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i'm afraid so.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{well, miss v.p. of development... let's go make history!}
