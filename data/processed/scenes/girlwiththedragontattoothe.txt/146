<L>__{interior the mill stockholm night}
<A>__{cacophony of loud techno and a fringe clientele. alone at a table drinking, salander seems comfortable with the noise and her dateless status, but doesn't avoid a glance from an asian girl at the bar, and doesn't tell her to go away when she comes over and motions to the empty chair.}
<L>__{interior salander's apartment morning}
<A>__{salander and the girl from the club, asleep in bed, entwined like snakes. salander wakes, disentangles herself, and is padding to the bathroom when there's a knock on her door. she stares it. no one ever knocks on her door. but someone knocks on it again. she crosses to it, wrapping herself in a blanket.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{who is it? blomkvist o s mikael blomkvist.}
<A>__{her mind races, as blomkvist's did to the news someone had invaded his privacy. she unlocks the door. cracks it enough to see him. he smiles, but it's disconcerting. she's not sure it's a harmless one.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{may i come in?}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{actually i'm not really up (yet) }
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{that's okay.}
<A>__{he pushes the door enough to pass. has a paper bag and satchel with him. takes in the place, including the girl in the bedroom, in a glance as he heads for the kitchen.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i assumed you wouldn't have had breakfast yet so i brought some bagel sandwiches. and tomato juice. good for hangovers. where do you keep the coffee?}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{hey. hey }
<P>__{(he stops; looks back)}
<D>__{who do you think you are?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i'm the guy you know better than my closest friends do.}
<A>__{he opens cabinets looking for the coffee. she stares.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{we have a lot to talk about, so why don't you take a shower, put on some clothes and get rid of your girlfriend.}
