<L>__{exterior control block night}
<A>__{the wind howls mournfully around the metal buildings, dry and cold.}
<L>__{interior operations}
<A>__{the weary and demoralized group is gathered to take stock of their grim options. vasquez and hudson are just setting down a scorched and dented packing case, one of several culled from the apc wreckage. hicks indicates their remaining inventory of weapons, lying on a table.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{this is all we could salvage. we've got four pulse rifles with about fifty rounds each. not so good. about fifteen m 40 grenades and two flame throwers less than half full...one damaged. and we've got four of these robot sentry units with scanners and display intact.}
<A>__{he opens one of the scorched cases, revealing a high tech servo actuated machine gun with optical sensing equipment, packed in foam.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{how long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{about seventeen days.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours! those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{she survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.}
<A>__{ripley indicates newt, who salutes hudson smartly.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{so you better just start dealing with it. just deal with it, hudson...because we need you and i'm tired of your bullshit. now get on a terminal and call up some kind of floor plan file. construction blueprints, maintenance schematics, anything that shows the layout of this place. i want to see air ducts, electrical access tunnels, subbasements. every possible way into this wing.}
<A>__{hudson gathers himself, thankful for the direction. hicks nods approval of her handling of it.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{aye firmative. i'm on it.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{i will be in medical. i'd like to continue my analysis.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{fine. you do that.}
