<L>__{ext mansion night}
<A>__{music and warm light spill from the windows. a couple eases through a french door and come racing across the lawn, giggling and hushing each other. they take refuge under a tree, revealing their faces to the moonlight: victor and elizabeth. she leans against the trunk to catch her breath.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{smell the air. wonderful.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{quite a send off, isn't it?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{father's so proud.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{and you?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{prouder still. you'll be the handsomest student there.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i will have to do better than that.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{you will.}
<P>__{(searches his eyes)}
<D>__{what do you want, victor?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{to be the best there ever was. to push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...}
<A>__{he's so serious, she can't help laugh.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i'm not mad.}
<A>__{she smiles, smoothes a lock of hair gently off his forehead.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{no. just very earnest. and very dear.}
<A>__{an extended moment. unspoken words flowing between them. victor leans forward and kisses her. her eyes widen slightly. so do his. shared excitement, gentle and sexy beyond belief. they pause, draw back, searching each other's eyes. he whispers:}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i've loved you all my life}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{all my life i've known.}
<A>__{they kiss again. a breath. a shiver.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{this feels... incestuous.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{is that what makes it so delicious?}
<A>__{she brushes her lips against his. gentle as a sigh.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{brother and sister still?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i wish to be your husband.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i wish to be your wife.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{then come with me to ingolstadt. marry me now.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{if only i could. but one of us must stay. father's not strong. willie's just a child. who can look after them in your absence? who can run the estate?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{only you.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i will be here when you return.}
<A>__{another kiss. turning lustful and steamy. they melt into each other, sinking down, bodies pressing and minds afire. these people are hot for each other. they stop, stunned at the intensity. he lays his head to her breast. their fingers clasp. she whispers her secret:}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{my head is spinning. i want to give myself to you.}
<A>__{he raises his head. she meets his gaze evenly}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{if we're to be married, must we wait?}
<A>__{he touches her face. fingertips tracing downward, gentle and reverent, brushing the contours of her bosom at the edge of her bodice. she shivers. closes her eyes. lays her hand over his. guiding his touch.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{you make me weak.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{not as weak as i.}
<A>__{she raises his hand to her mouth. brushing his fingertips with her lips. wrestling with desire. their eyes meet.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{our decision. together.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{your decision. for us.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{i give you my soul...}
<C>__{victor}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{...until our wedding night. when our bodies will join.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{victor. i love you,}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{elizabeth. my more than sister.}
<A>__{they kiss again. gently...}
