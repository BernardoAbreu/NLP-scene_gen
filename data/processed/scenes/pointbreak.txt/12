<A>__{the bandits burst through the doors and sprint to the alley where they jump into the sedan. the driver, the woman pig nose, punches it and the tires whirrr on the slick pavement. the sedan launches down the alley. utah running. like a freight train. splashing through a cross alley. he doesn't break stride as he slams his shoulder into a large, steel garbage dumpster. driving it like a football training sled into the alley where the sedan locks 'em up seconds too late as it skids and slams into it, crunching into the brick wall and still alive grinds into reverse back down the alley, headlights smashed, it guns it backward as utah leaps over the dumpster and sprints after the car. he has a brick in his right hand. he cocks it back. johnny heaves the brick thirty yards and smash! the brick explodes into the windshield, spiderwebbing the glass. lady pignose flinches from the glass fragments thrown into her face.}
<C>__{lady pignose}
<D>__{son of a bitch!}
<A>__{the car slews backward onto the street, slamming a parked car. lady pignose slams the thing into drive, cuts the wheel hard, and punches it, skidding on wet pavement. utah hurtles from the alley. he leaps, somehow tackles the driver's door handle and is dragged along the street. he pulls himself up, reaches inside the window, and whips the steering wheel hard right. the sedan fishtails into a parked toyota. utah bounces forward, slamming into the asphalt. glass shards and crushed steel are strewn everywhere, as radiator steam whistles hot. pig nose #2, riding shotgun, is trapped. can't get his crushed door open. the driver pushes open her door. gropes for her pistol. utah springs no respect for a lady. he slams the door, pins her arm and slams again and again until the gun drops. utah kicks it away as the woman collapses in pain. pig nose #1 bails out and runs across parking lot. utah leaps up onto the crushed hood and draws down with the shotgun.}

<D>__{halt. fbi!}
<A>__{pig nose #1 spins. we sense reckless anger. he raises the uzi. utah squeezes the trigger. no death. no blood. just buzzers and flashing bulbs. pig nose's flak vest lights up like a pinball machine. utah's laser weapon hit the "kill zone". pig nose rips the tape off his face and the fbi cadet shakes his head in disgust. observers step forward. bank customers. bank tellers. all fbi personnel. medical staff offer the woman driver assistance. pig nose #1 heads for johnny, but is subdued by other agents.}

<A>__{pig nose explodes. more agents restrain him. screams and shoving matches and pissed off guys. utah walks off, down the simulated street, past a sign which bears the fbi seal and reads "combat village, quantico, virginia."}
