<L>__{interior ben's room early morning}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{ben! you overslept again damn it!}
<A>__{the room looks like a 6 (but i'm almost 7) year old exploded. posters of magicians on all the walls. rachel darts about the room mismatching the clothes she forgot to arrange the night before.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{get up get up get up!}
<A>__{the lump under the cover doesn't move.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{ben you're late. i'm serious. i'm wearing a very serious face. don't make me start counting one...}
<A>__{no movement. rachel tugs the sleeve of a shirt hanging on a chair, and out comes a magician's bouquet of flowers.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{two.}
<A>__{she pulls a dirty handkerchief out of the pocket of the shirt it's an endless magician's handkerchief.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{don't make me say three i'm about to say three.}
<P>__{(a beat, then)}
<D>__{three!}
<A>__{she rips the covers off and a blow up dinosaur sleeps in ben's place.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{ben i'm not kidding around. you make yourself appear this instant!}
<A>__{a white bunny saunters across her toes. rachel screams then gathers her wits and searches under the bed under the bureau she opens the closet doors and shoving clothes aside.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you might think this is funny but this is actually not funny.}
<A>__{unseen by rachel, six year old ben sits, perched on the highest closet shelf, knees under his chin, holding his breath. his eyes gleeful as rachel frantically closes the closet door.}
