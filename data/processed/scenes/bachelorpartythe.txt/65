<L>__{interior. the bedroom}
<A>__{it is a tiny bedroom. the bed is covered with purses and summer stoles and other guest things. an uncovered, improvised closet, really a rack of hanging dresses and things, gives the room an overburdened look. charlie comes into the room after her, closes the door, looks for the latch. she pushes some of the things on the bed aside and sits down and waits while charlie latches the door, a matter of turning a bent nail into locking position. she begins to prattle again.}

<D>__{so i finally got to sleep around six thirty this morning. at nine thirty, someone began pounding on my door again. i got out of bed and opened the door, and there was my landlord with the pince nez wearing a blue silk kimono. "oh, for heaven's sakes," i said, "what do you want now?" he said: "i'm the landlord, and i want the rent." i said: "you're an old man, go to sleep." then the phone rang. it was a boy named andrew i know who teaches physics at columbia university, and he's insanely jealous. he's married and has four children, but he keeps badgering me to run away with him to nicaragua, throw up his professorship and all that. well, my landlord began shouting some garbled baudelaire at the top of his lungs, and a little verlaine, and a little huysmans. he apparently has some kind of fetish about french decadents. and naturally, andrew heard him, and he got furious, and he said: "who's that i hear?" i said, "that's the landlord." he said: "what does he want?" i said: "he wants the rent." well, at this point, i felt like chucking the whole business and going back to bessemer city and going to work in my father's hardware store.}
<A>__{charlie has stood a moment, listening to this bizarre story. then he has busied himself cleaning a place beside the existentialist on the bed. he brings an end to the rococo narration by putting his arms around the existentialist and in a moment, she responds hungrily. closeup of charlie and the existentialist in a desperate embrace.}

<D>__{just say you love me.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{the existentialist}
<D>__{just say you love me. you don't have to mean it.}
<A>__{he tries to kiss her again, himself charged high at the moment, but she turns her face away from him. the dialogue is intense, whispered, hungry.}
<C>__{the existentialist}
<D>__{no, don't. ...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{the existentialist}
<D>__{say you love me....}

<D>__{look, maybe we ought to go someplace else? i'm having a very tricky thing going with my landlord and i don't want him to see us leaving together. so you know what you do? there's a bar down the street. you go out the door and turn to your right. you know the one i mean?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yes, i know.}
<C>__{the existentialist}
<D>__{well, you go there and i will be there as fast as i can. now, wait for me now, because i can't stand being alone at night. you'll like me. i'm supposed to be very amusing. all right?}
<A>__{she turns abruptly and goes out the door. he stands for a moment and then follows. he stands on the upper landing, watching her pick her way down the stairs into the living room. she looks quickly around the room, apparently finds whom she is looking for, and moves quickly to a little group of men, one of whom is about sixty years old with a thin elegance and a cruel face, the landlord. he has several young men around him, all rather frail, ivy leagueish. she joins the group, to the distaste of the young men, and is immediately voluble and gesticulatory. after a moment, charlie lets his eyes wander over the room, apparently sees eddie.}
<C>__{charlie}

<D>__{hey, eddie ...}
<A>__{apparently, eddie doesn't hear him. charlie frowns and begins making his own way down the stairs to the living room.}
