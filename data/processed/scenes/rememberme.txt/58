<A>__{tyler returns with breakfast. from aidan's room, a pathetic croak...}
<D>__{aidan o s bialy.}
<A>__{tyler tosses him a bialy like he's tossing fish to a seal. ally lies on the couch. curled in a blanket. a cup of hot tea in hand. she sips it. it stings her lip a little.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{hey...}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{hey...}
<A>__{tyler sits. she shifts and curls next to him.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{where did you go?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{downtown.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{tyler pulls his journal from his pocket. hands it to her.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{there's a coffee shop. i brought you a bialy.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{new york is full of coffee shops.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{this one was our place... michael's and mine. we had breakfast there all the time ... maybe not as many times as i think we did. but enough times. anyway we ate there that morning. it was the last place i saw him.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{oh. so you go there to write? to him?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{maybe. sometimes. i don't know. but i guess i wanted to tell him about you.}
<A>__{ally is moved, you can see it in her eyes, but she chooses not to overdo it. she flips through the journal. she hands it back to him. then out of nowhere.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{my mom was murdered eight years ago. the same year your brother died.}
<A>__{tyler is stunned.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{you don't need to say anything, i know you're sorry. everyone's always sorry, you know?}
<A>__{he does.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{it's just, i need you to know that, my dad, he's not an evil guy.}
<C>__{ally }
<D>__{i don't want you to think that because i'm here he's some kind of belligerent psychotic, he's not...i don't know, it's just recently, he seems really...}
<A>__{she looks at tyler's face. his eyes are so patient. ally tears up.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{wounded? our house is like the recovery room, or the critical care unit or something.}
<A>__{tyler strokes her hair.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{i don't feel like that, though. i feel like i'm getting stronger and like i'm leaving him behind to swim in it all by himself.}
<A>__{she is weeping. tyler pulls her to him doing the best he can. holding her and kissing her hair.}
