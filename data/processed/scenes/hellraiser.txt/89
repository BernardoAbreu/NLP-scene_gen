<A>__{she crosses the landing and climbs the stairs to the torture room.}
<L>__{interior torture room day}
<A>__{she opens the door. as she does so frank retreats into the shadows. we are granted a fleeting glimpse of him, his body fuller than before, but still horribly vulnerable. julia looks at prudhoe's corpse. a trail of blood leads away from it into the darkness. the body itself is a grotesquely misshapen husk now, the muscle and fat withered, the eyes sunk into the skull, the lips drawn back to expose the gums. a ghostly sight.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{jesus christ.}
<A>__{julia looks across at frank, who is no longer sitting, but standing in the shadows.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(his voice stronger)}
<D>__{do i disgust you?}
<A>__{she doesn't reply. he stretches his arm into a passage of light. his flesh glistens and pulses.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{see? it's making me whole again.}
<A>__{he turns his arm over for her appreciation.}
<D>__{every drop of blood you spill puts more flesh on my bones. and we both want that don't we?}
<A>__{she nods.}
<D>__{good. come here.}
<A>__{she stares, unable to move.}
<D>__{come here, damn you. i want to touch you ...}
<A>__{still she doesn't move.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(more softly)}
<D>__{come to daddy. i only want to touch ...}
<A>__{she takes a step towards his outstretched arm. his fingers touch her face. she steels herself against them. now, he starts to trace the line of her jaw, stroking her. now her lips, caressingly. suddenly, a sound from downstairs. the front door is opened.}

<P>__{(from below)}
<D>__{sweetheart?}
<A>__{julia withdraws from his touch}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(from below)}
<D>__{where are you?}
