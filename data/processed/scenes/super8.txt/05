<L>__{exterior joe's house day moments later}
<A>__{a wide shot. a grey, snow covered, early february day here in lillian, ohio. many cars are parked outside the house, notably a sheriff's department squad car in the driveway. joe, a vision of black on white in his too big black suit, now sits on a small swing set he hasn't used in years. he solemnly looks down at the locket he still holds. no doubt trying to reconcile the fact that it no longer hangs around his mother's neck. then a sound. joe looks up. a car has arrived a distinct 1968 buick gsx a yellow muscle car with a black racing stripe down its center. joe watches as the car sits there for a moment. then a man gets out. someone joe has seen before, but doesn't know personally. a man in his early 40's, in jeans and a work shirt. he's not exactly sloppy, but if you look closely, you could tell he's been drinking. this is louis dainard. joe watches louis carefully as he moves to the house, to the porch and inside the house. joe's eyes glued on the house for a while. then he looks back to the locket. he opens it, and stares at the picture inside (which we do not see). and as he stares, tears come to his eyes. a moment broken by the sound of raised voices joe turns toward the house. after a beat, the sound of something breaking something glass. then the house back door bursts open joe cranes his neck and what he sees he'll never forget: his father, jack, leading an in pain and hand cuffed louis dainard from the house and into the rear of the squad car. when he slams the back door, he sees joe. sort of freezes as their eyes lock. but jack's more uncomfortable}
