<A>__{jeanne enters the already open door. she looks around the still sparsely furnished living room. living room paul has decided his bed fits better in here. the bottom mattress is on the floor in the middle of the room. he leans against the wall and top mattress, waiting for jeanne. he knew she'd be there. she takes a seat on the bottom mattress and takes off her boots. he watches her and does the same with his shoes. kicking them off and catching them in the air playfully.}

<A>__{paul does some playful animal sounds. ape sounding grunts and such. he contorts his face and looks silly.}
