<A>__{the star man spots jenny standing on the line peering into the on coming cars for signs of him. he becomes agitated and his mouth begins to move soundlessly. there is a break in the traffic and jenny dashes to the center divider. the star man leans across his driver and yells as the roadrunner plunges by her.}

<L>__{exterior interstate day}
<A>__{jenny spins around to see the roadrunner skid to a stop on the shoulder and the star man get out. a motorcycle bombs by. he starts across the lanes of traffic toward jenny. a truck blasts past him in the slow lane. he is buffeted into the fast lane. jenny runs down the center divider to meet him. a vw honks, its tires squeal on the pavement as it swerves around him. he reaches the safety of the center divider. jenny throws her arms around him and lays her head against his chest. he stands there uncomfortably not knowing how to respond to this human emotion.}

<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i didn't ask to come along on this trip, but i sure as hell am going to be the one to say when i get off.}
<A>__{they bolt across the lanes of traffic to the other side of the road where she flags down an old black pickup truck. she says something to the driver and she and the star man climb into the back. as the truck returns to the highway, the clack of an approaching helicopter overpowers the traffic sounds.}
