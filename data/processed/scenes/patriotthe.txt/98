<L>__{interior cornwallis' headquarters day}
<A>__{major halbert ushers marion in. the great danes follow sniffing curiously, sensing something or someone.}
<C>__{major halbert}
<D>__{lord cornwallis will be with you presently.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{major halbert}
<D>__{you may, of course, keep your weapons, but i must warn you that...}
<C>__{marion}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{i'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.}
<C>__{major halbert}
<D>__{yes, quite, but you should know that...}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{that will be all, major. i will wait for lord cornwallis.}
<C>__{major halbert}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{yes... you will wait.}
<A>__{major halbert turns and starts to stride out.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{one other thing.}
<A>__{major halbert stops.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{the proper form of address to a superior officer, even one of an opposing army, is "yes, sir."}
<A>__{major halbert sneers and strides from the room. marion alone, except for the dogs, allows himself a fleeting smile. then he looks around the room. he notes a rocking chair. curious, he hefts it. too heavy. he puts it down, sits and rocks. the dogs walk over and lay at his feet.}
