<L>__{interior sullivan master bedroom night (later)}
<A>__{a clock on the side table beside the three clickers. there is the sound of a vacuum it's later now. the place is incredibly changed. christy is lying as before except now she is fully dressed. the bed has been made with clean sheets. there is a large black garbage bag that collin shoves the sheets in, dumps in christy's jewelry. burton is vacuuming the rug. richmond is visible, still in terrible shape, finishing putting his clothes on in the open master bedroom. everyone wears gloves. everything that is incriminating is gone except the letter opener, which has been put in a clear plastic bag. collin reaches for it, starts to dump it in along with the sheets and the jewelry.}

<D>__{thanks for sharing.}
<A>__{collin glances at burton, shrugs, hands it over. russell puts it in her handbag, puts the handbag on the bed table when suddenly richmond, careening into the room, wide eyed, crying out }
<C>__{richmond}
<D>__{gloria i killed her }
<A>__{russell, turning, shocked as richmond bears down she holds out her arms for him, but he is staggering and he collides hard with her, spins against the wall, uses the bed table to try to steady himself.}
