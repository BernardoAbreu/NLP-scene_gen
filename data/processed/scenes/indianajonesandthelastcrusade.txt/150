<A>__{we hear the tank exploding.}
<C>__{sallah}
<D>__{indy?!}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{oh, god. i've lost him. and i never told him anything. i just wasn't ready, marcus. five minutes would have been enough.}
<A>__{and then... looking dazed and bewildered, indy staggers up behind them. he joins the others at the edge of the cliff, looking down at the wreckage below with a bewildered expression. finally, henry becomes aware of his presence. henry says nothing. he just looks at indy, overcome with emotion. finally, he throws his arms around him.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i thought i'd lost you, boy.}
<A>__{after a moment, indy's head clears. and he becomes aware of his father's embrace. something he hasn't felt in a long timeif ever. and it touches him. he hugs his father back.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i thought you had too, sir.}
<A>__{brody and sallah are moved by this sudden reconciliation.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{wellwell done! come on!}
<A>__{henry pats indy on the back and indy collapses, sitting hard on the rocky cliff edge. unaware, henry, sallah and brody start to walk away. henry turns back to see indy still sitting on the ground.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{let's go then. why are you sitting there resting when we're so near the end? come on let's go!}
<A>__{henry turns and walks toward the horse with brody and sallah. suddenly the fedora, borne on the wind, blows into scene and lands at indy's feet.}
