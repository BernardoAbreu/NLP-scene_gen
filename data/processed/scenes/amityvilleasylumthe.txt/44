<A>__{lisa follows delaney down a winding staircase. as they descend down the steps, the light fades.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{23.interior ward x continuous}
<A>__{delaney and lisa enter a long dark corridor with a row of thick metal doors either side. two light bulbs hang from the ceiling at each end of the corridor, providing only minimal illumination. lisa's nose twitches.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{what's that smell?}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{it always hangs in the air. no matter how much we bleach the floor there is always that smell of death.}
<A>__{lisa looks concerned.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{these patients are dangerous?}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{yes. but don't worry, we never have to interact directly or anything like that. you will just be mopping the corridor and dusting.}
<A>__{delaney walks over to the first door on the right. there is a hatch on the door. delaney slowly slides it open and beckons lisa over. she peers inside. the cell is very basic, white walls with the only furniture being an uncomfortable looking bed and a toilet without a seat. there are thick iron bars on one small window. a skinny man in his thirties sits on a basic bed in a white vest, rocking back and forth. he has wild hair and a scraggly beard.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{that's jerry kimble. he was convicted of stabbing a young mother forty nine times in front of her two year old son, then killing and sexually assaulting a woman before smothering her four year old daughter. they call him the green chain rapist. he was in sing sing but was certified insane and his lawyer got him transferred here. he doesn't make any noise or fuss, but he is a dangerous man. especially towards women. this next inmate is even worse.}
<A>__{delaney slides the hatch shut and walks over to the next door. he slowly slides open the hatch and lisa peers inside. another basic white cell with only a bed and toilet. a man stands in the centre of the room with his hands behind his back. his hair is slicked back, as jet black as the eyes that stare at lisa. he smiles. delaney slides the hatch shut.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{that's dennis palmer. also known as the long island cannibal. he was abused as a child so his targets were always paedophiles and rapists. he'd track them down and torture them. he would eat parts of their body while they were still alive.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{that's horrible.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{the most horrible thing is that a lot of the public thought he was a hero.}
<A>__{delaney walks over to a door on the opposite side of the hallway. he slides open the hatch.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{sadie krenwinkel.}
<A>__{lisa looks inside. inside the basic cell a woman sits cross legged on her bed. she has long flowing black hair, intense eyes and a pentagram carved into her forehead. she looks up and smiles at lisa. delaney slides the hatch shut.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{what's her deal?}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{she was a member of a witchcraft cult. they kidnapped six people for a demonic ritual. five were killed but one got away and led police to the cult. she turned her trial into a circus, talking about lots of crazy stuff. the media enjoyed it but she got certified insane by the court. she's been around a few institutions since. now she's here.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{some strange stories here.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{well those aren't the strangest.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{this last patient is the strangest case.}
<A>__{delaney walks over to the last door on the left. he slides open the hatch. a singular shaft of light coming from a tiny barred window barely penetrates the darkness of the cell. lisa peers inside to see a man sat in the shadows.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{this is our resident john doe. sometimes we have people with amnesia. often we find out who they are. not so with this man.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{why is he down here?}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{they first brought him in about six months ago. no one knows where he came from, he literally just turned up late one night. an orderly found him wandering the grounds. first of all he was like missus hardesty upstairs catatonic. then a few weeks later he started to respond to doctor mixter and the nurses through facial expressions and gestures. but soon, he got violent. very violent. he'd have bursts of rage and beat other patients. one day he appeared to have a seizure and collapsed. a young doctor tried to take his vital signs. patient x here throttled him so hard he crushed his larynx. it took six orderlies to restrain him. now they won't even let him out for the obligatory hour a day exercise. we still don't know who he is.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{oh god.}
<A>__{delaney stares at lisa.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{god has nothing to do with this man.}
<A>__{delaney slams the hatch shut. lisa looks disturbed.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{i haven't put you off have i?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i guess not... it's just a lot to take in. i've obviously never been around stuff like this before.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{this is the reality of this place. we don't deal with these people directly but we may have to clean up their mess. if you can't handle that then i understand. you know that it's not too late to back out?}
<A>__{lisa considers for a moment.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i'm not a quitter.}
