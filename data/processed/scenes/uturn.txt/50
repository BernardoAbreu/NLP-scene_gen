<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i could if i had jake's money.}
<C>__{grace }

<D>__{it was your idea, remember? i'm doing this for you. i'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.}
<A>__{grace bites at a nail and fidgets, but says nothing.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{grace ... grace?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{after dark. i will leave the back door unlocked.}
