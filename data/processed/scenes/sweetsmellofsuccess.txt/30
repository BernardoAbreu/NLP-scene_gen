<A>__{orange juice stand night shooting east on 46th street walks sidney, coming out of the entrance of his apartment, towards camera. he is pleased with himself, satisfied with his ingenuity in dealing with rita and bartha. the streets behind him are dark and empty (it is about 3:00 in the morning). camera moves with sidney as he steps briskly into the orange juice stand and lifts the receiver from the pay telephone. there are no other customers at the counter, but the man behind is squeezing orange halves for the day ahead, piling up a mountain of empties some of which fall at sidney's feet.}
