<C>__{bill}
<D>__{she's been carrying that letter around for weeks. i've read it three times...}
<A>__{there's a sudden sharp yelp from the bathroom.}
<C>__{margo's voice}

<D>__{like tryin' to zip a pretzel stand still!}
<A>__{bill grins.}
<C>__{bill}

<D>__{then why? why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the theater }
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{the theatuh, the theatuh }
<P>__{(he sits up)}
<D>__{ what book of rules says the theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of new york city? or london, paris or vienna?}
<P>__{(he gets up)}
<D>__{listen, junior. and learn. want to know what the theater is? a flea circus. also opera. also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, indian tribal dances, punch and judy, a one man band all theater. wherever there's magic and make believe and an audience there's theater. donald duck, ibsen, and the lone ranger, sarah bernhardt, poodles hanneford, lunt and fontanne, betty grable, rex and wild, and eleanora duse. you don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? the theater's for everybody you included, but not exclusively so don't approve or disapprove. it may not be your theater, but it's theater of somebody, somewhere.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i just asked a simple question.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{and i shot my mouth off. nothing personal, junior, no offense...}
<P>__{(he sits back down)}

<A>__{he lies down again.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{but hollywood. you mustn't stay there.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(he closes his eyes)}
<D>__{it's only one picture deal.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{so few come back...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{yeah. they keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...}
