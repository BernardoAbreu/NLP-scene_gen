<A>__{darkness. the soft sound of moving water can be heard in the background. from the top of the screen a tiny, floating light moves its way downwards across the screen. as it passes, we see just under the water part of a young mans face. his eyes are closed. the light disappears, and across the darkness appears the title s a w. the title fades away. the tiny light appears again, this time floating down at the end of a tub of water, just near someones bare foot. the camera cuts again to the face of the young man underwater. this is adam. suddenly, his eyes fly open and he comes to life, opening his mouth and gasping for air. as he wakes up and struggles within the bathtub, we see his foot catch on a drain plug, unplugging it. the water starts to drain, and we see go with the water the tiny light, which we can also see has some kind of key attached to it. the room itself is pitch black, but we can still just barely make him out in the dark. adam lifts himself out of the tub and falls onto the floor, coughing and gasping from the shock. he manages to get to his feet, but as he moves forward he realizes that his ankle is chained to something. he feels his way over to a pipe in the corner, reaching down and pulling at his chain that is attached to it. he cries out, his voice frantic, frightened, and a bit hysterical.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{help! someone help me! (he stops when he hears a loud dragging sound somewhere in the room. he looks out into the darkness and calls out.) is someone there? hey!}
<P>__{(he turns back to the corner to which}
<D>__{he is chained, says in a slightly softer but still panicked voice) shit, im probably dead.}
<A>__{suddenly, from out within the darkness comes a mans low, raspy voice. it startles adam. the voice, we will soon learn, belongs to lawrence.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{youre not dead.}
<A>__{adam quickly turns in the direction of the voice. holding his arms out for balance, he tries to look across the room to whoever is speaking, but still cannot see a thing.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{whos that? whos that?!}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(his voice strangely a bit on the calm}
<D>__{side, and almost irritated with adams reaction to the situation. this shall}
<P>__{be his tone for many scenes to come.)}
<D>__{theres no point in yelling, i already tried it.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{turn on the lights!}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{would if i could.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what the fuck is going on? where am i? (he turns into his corner, touching}
<P>__{the wall.)}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{i dont know yet.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(smelling something; in disgust) what}
<D>__{is that smell?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{shh! hang on a second, i think i found something.}
<A>__{with a loud click and an even louder buzzing sound, the very bright fluorescent lights come to life, lighting up in rows, starting from lawrences end and moving towards adam. as they come on, adam is nearly blinded by the sudden change from pitch black to bright white and squints in pain, holding up his arms to cover his face. in the light we now see that he is in his mid twenties, with short brown hair, wearing a dark blue striped shirt over a white tee shirt and jeans, looking like a drowned rat from the tub. it takes him a moment but his eyes finally start to adjust, and he looks around the room. he and we see lawrence, who also winces from the glare of the lights, standing by the light switch and the door. he is on the opposite end of the room, also chained to a pipe in the corner by his foot. he wears a blue button down dress shirt, now soaked with sweat stains. he is middle aged, mid to late forties, with pale blonde hair and even paler skin. dark circles are under his eyes. both men are barefoot. lawrences eyes adjust to the light and he sees across the room. then, his gaze starts towards the center of the room, as does adams, who steps forward as much as he can, a look of horror on his face. we see lying face down the body of a man who has blown his brains out, lying in a pool of blood, clad in only boxer shorts and a tee shirt. in his left hand is a gun, in his right hand is a micro cassette recorder. a gunshot and a scream are heard as the camera moves up and in a fast 360 angle above and circling the man, ending in a full overhead view of him. the shot cuts to adam, who reels in shock and disgust.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{holy shit!}
<A>__{he turns towards the tub and leans over, gagging and coughing. lawrence in the meantime hops forward the best he can, studying the body with a look of fear and concern. adam stops coughing and turns back around, takes another look at the body and around the room. he looks down at his chain then starts to completely freak out, grabbing and pulling at his chain.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(screaming) help!!! (he falls back onto}
<D>__{his bottom on the floor as he yanks at the chain as hard as he can.) help!!! help!}
<A>__{lawrence just stands and watches him with an almost embarrassed, appalled look at his behaviour. it seems that lawrence, despite being in the situation hes in, is above that kind of uncontrolled reaction. he speaks a bit coldly.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{no one can hear you.}
<A>__{adam stops pulling at the chain, stands up and looks to lawrence, his breathing fast and heavy. his voice is not yelling anymore but still just as hysterical.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what the fuck is this?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{calm down, just calm down. (he knows that to remain calm is to remain in control, something he must be no matter what the situation.) are you hurt?}
<A>__{adam looks down at himself, shrugging slightly.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i dont know...yeah!}
<A>__{lawrence moves over to the pipe in the corner, leaning against it for support.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(calmly) whats your name?}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(sarcastic) my name is very fucking}
<D>__{confused! (demanding) whats your name? whats going on here?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(internal eye roll; hes getting more and more aggravated with adams behaviour)}
<D>__{my name is lawrence gordon, im a doctor. i just woke up here, just like you.}
<P>__{(he reaches up, wipes his face with his sleeve)}
<A>__{adam kneels back down facing the pipe, pulling at his chains once more, but not with his prior panic. he winces at the metal biting into his skin.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(in pain) ah!}
<A>__{lawrence looks at adam with a look that seems to say im stuck in here with this guy? he then glances down at the body.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{recognize him?}
<A>__{adam continues to pull at his chains, does not and will not look at the body, just shakes his head.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(sharply) no.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(trying to get something out of this}
<D>__{kid) well, do you have any idea how you got here?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{whats the last thing you remember?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{nothing. (he sits back onto the floor,}
<P>__{stops pulling at his chains for a moment.)}
<D>__{i went to bed in my shithole apartment, and woke up in an actual shithole. (he raises his left leg slightly, starts trying to pull his foot out of the iron cuff. he glances to lawrence, who has moved over to the wall to his left, bent over slightly and resting a hand against a pipe.) so what about you, huh?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(he shrugs slightly, shaking his head.)}
<D>__{well theres...theres not much to tell, really. (across the room, adam gives up with the chain for the time being but remains sitting on the floor.) i was on my way home from work and uh, i dont remember anything else.}
<A>__{adam just sits there, glancing over to the body and then focusing on it much more. the initial panic has worn off for now, replaced simply with fear and shock. his voice is a bit softer.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{first dead body ive ever seen. look different in real life. they dont move.}
<A>__{lawrence slowly lowers himself into a sitting position against the wall. he pokes slightly at the iron cuff around his foot.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{from the looks of these chains, someone didnt want us to go very far either.}
<A>__{suddenly, adam leaps up, lifting up his shirt and exposing his abdomen. his panic is back, but not at full force like before. he studies himself then glances to lawrence.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{can you see any scars?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(looking at him strangely) what?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{huh? this is what they do man, (he gestures to his stomach, where there are in fact no scars.) they kidnap you and drug you and before you know it, youre in a bathtub and your kidneys are on ebay.}
<P>__{(a ridiculous theory to us and to lawrence, but adam states it with conviction.)}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(a scoffing tone in his voice) no one}
<D>__{has taken your kidneys.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(disbelief) how can you tell from way}
<D>__{over there?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(matter of fact) because youd either}
<D>__{be in terrible agony, or youd be dead by now. trust me.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what are you, a surgeon? (he lowers his shirt and turns and bends down to}
<P>__{prod at the chain around the pipe again.)}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{yeah. (he sighs. hes getting tired}
<P>__{of adam already. he speaks sharply.)}
<D>__{so, you gonna tell me your name, or what?}
<A>__{adam stands back up, turns to lawrence, his voice once again calm.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{adam.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(getting to his feet, his voice a bit}
<D>__{calmer) well adam, what we need to do}
<P>__{(he leans with one hand outstretched}
<D>__{against the pipe to his right. adam watches him, scared but calm) is start thinking about why were here. whoever brought us there couldve killed us by now. but they didnt. they must want something from us. (he looks up and around the room) question is what. (he sees something up on the wall, moves forwards a bit towards it. we see that it is a brand new clock on the wall, ticking away. it reads currently at 10:22.) that clock.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what about it?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{its brand new. (squints, studying it)}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(not getting what hes implying) so?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(sighs; its quite simple, why cant}
<D>__{adam see it?) so, someone obviously wanted us to know the time. (adam looks a bit confused still, mulls over that}
<P>__{information. lawrence thinks for a moment.)}
<D>__{wait, i think i may be able to reach that door.}
<A>__{lawrence moves over as far as the chain will allow him to the giant, wooden sliding door, pushing against it as hard as he can. in the meantime, we see adam thinking. he pauses, then reaches down and starts going through his pockets. there is nothing in the front two, but in his back left pocket he pulls out a plastic baggie with a white envelope in it. he unfolds the baggie; the envelope says adam. he stares at it in his hands, wondering what it is. lawrence continues struggling with the door, quickly glances over his shoulder to see what adam is doing. he sees adam holding the baggie. adam reaches into the envelope, pulls out a micro cassette tape. a close up shows the words play me written on the tape label. adam holds it in his hand, studying it. lawrence turns away from the door, looking over and trying to see what adam has in his hand.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{what is that? (adam doesnt answer, continues looking at the tape. lawrences voice grows impatient.) excuse me.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(glances up briefly at lawrence, then}
<D>__{back down at the tape. his voice sounds slightly surprised.) its a tape.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{where did you find it?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{it was in my pocket.}
<A>__{lawrence thinks about that briefly then starts digging through his own pockets, finds within them a white envelope with lawrence written across it in the same black lettering as adams.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(regarding his tape) it says play me.}
<A>__{lawrence tears into his envelope, empties the contents into the palm of his hand. first, he holds up a similar tape to adams. it also says play me. then he holds up a single bullet, studying it, not sure what its there for yet. then, he holds up a tiny key. he bends over, gets down on the floor and starts to try to unlock his chains with the key. it doesnt seem to be working.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(frustrated, mumbling to himself and}
<D>__{to the key) come on, come on, come on....}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(seeing that it doesnt seem to be working}
<D>__{on lawrences lock) throw it over here.}
<A>__{lawrence gives him a slightly mistrustful look, but then holds up the key and throws it. adam misses the key at first as it hits the floor in front of the dirty toilet near his corner.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{fuck. (he leans over and picks up the key, then bends down and tries the key on the lock on his ankle, which doesnt work. he tries the lock on the chains around the pipe. it isnt working there}
<P>__{either.)}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(watching him) no?}
<A>__{adam gives up, drops the key onto the floor frustratedly, shaking his head. thats when he looks over to the body again, and the shot closes up on the hand holding the tape recorder. a small loop handle juts out of the hands grip. adam stands up, then bends down and picks up the tape on the floor, looking at it. he puts it back down then stretches himself flat out on the floor, trying to reach. unfortunately, there is still a good three to four feet between him and the body.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{use your shirt.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(gets back up to his knees) what?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{your shirt.}
<A>__{adam looks down at himself, then takes off the long sleeved blue shirt. he lays back down, holding the shirt by the ends of each sleeve, and throws it, trying to catch it on the tape recorder. it misses. he tries a second time; same result.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{come on...}
<A>__{adam tries again; it misses. it is just barely reaching. he pulls the shirt back, gets back up on his knees, aggravated.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{it wont work.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(trying to get him to not give up yet)}
<D>__{well, look around, there must be something else you can use.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(stands, ready to give up, skeptical)}
<D>__{theres nothing.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(insistent) well there must be something!}
<A>__{adam looks around his area, then into the bathtub. he sees something, bends over, takes out the tub plug, which is attached to a long cord. he ties the cord around the sleeve of his shirt. he kneels down, holding out the shirt, aiming.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{come on, you can do it.}
<A>__{adam throws it, attempting to get the plug through the loop at the end of the tape recorder. he misses.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{come on, come on, again.}
<A>__{he tries again and misses. on the third try, however, he gets the plug right through the loop. lawrence smiles in relief. adam very slowly pulls it back, dragging the tape recorder along the floor towards him. he picks it up, getting rid of the plug and dropping it and the shirt on the floor. he picks up the tape, pops it in and presses play, holding the tape recorder out a bit so that they can both hear, but keeping his head tilted so he can hear better. a chilling deep, raspy, sinister male voice the jigsaw killer comes from the tape. as it speaks, adams expression is fearful, but the thought how does he know? can be detected.}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(on tape) rise and shine, adam. youre}
<D>__{probably wondering where you are. ill tell you where you might be. you might be in the room that you die in. up until now, you simply sat in the shadows, watching others live out their lives. but what do voyeurs see when they look into the mirror? now, i see you as a strange mix of someone angry and yet apathetic. but mostly just pathetic. so are you going to watch yourself die today, adam? or do something about it?}
<P>__{(end)}
<A>__{adam looks frightened but not sure of the entire meaning of the message.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i dont get it. (he presses the stop}
<P>__{button on the tape.)}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(eagerly, gestures.) throw me the player.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(pauses, thinks) no, you throw me your}
<D>__{tape.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(a heavy sigh. he looks at adam as a}
<D>__{slow minded fool who simply doesnt understand the full capacity of the situation that theyre in, and speaks to him as such.) look, were going to have to work together if we want to get out of here. now just throw it to me.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(picks up on the tone, speaks defensively)}
<D>__{im not going to risk breaking it! you throw me your tape!}
<A>__{lawrence pauses, looking at adam as though hed like to smack him, then holds up and tosses the tape. it hits the floor behind adam, who kneels down and picks it up, pops it in, presses play. its the same chilling voice as on adams tape. as the tape plays, adam stares at lawrence, and lawrence at the tape recorder.}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(on tape) dr. gordon, this is your wake}
<D>__{up call. every day of your working life, you have given people the news that they are going to die soon. now you will be the cause of death. your aim in this game is to kill adam. (adam glances down at the tape recorder wide eyed, then back up at lawrence) you have until six on the clock to do it. there sa man in the room with you. when theres that much poison in your blood (another view of the body from lawrences pov), the only thing left to do is shoot yourself.}
<P>__{(jigsaw coughs) there are ways to win}
<D>__{this hidden all around you. just remember: x marks the spot for the treasure. if you do not kill adam by 6:00, then alison and diana will die, dr. gordon. and ill leave you in this room to rot.}
<P>__{let the game begin. (end)}
<A>__{the looks on each mans face clearly say oh shit. the tape ends. lawrence stands up.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(firmly) give me that. now. (adam tosses}
<D>__{him the tape. he catches it, rewinds, plays back. adam stands up from his}
<P>__{spot on the floor.)}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(on tape)...then alison and diana will}
<D>__{die, dr. gordon. and ill leave you in this room to rot.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(thinking, trying to figure this out)}
<D>__{any idea who that is?}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(on tape) let the game begin.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{he knows us.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{wait a minute. (rewinds more)}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(false hope) what do you think? probably}
<D>__{a joke, right?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{shh, shh! (presses play)}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(on tape) let the game begin.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(softly) listen...}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(on tape, in a very hushed tone after}
<D>__{a brief silence)...follow your heart.}
<A>__{lawrence stops the tape.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what the hell does follow your heart mean?}
<A>__{lawrence is looking around, on the walls and everywhere else in the bathroom for a heart. he spots a small one drawn in brown on the toilet next to adam and points.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{there! right next to you, on the toilet.}
<A>__{adam looks, sees the toilet. slowly, he bends down, resting his hands on the seat, looking down into the bowl of liquid shit, not really sure what hes looking for.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(impatient, gesturing) come on, come}
<D>__{on.}
<A>__{adam glances up at lawrence with a look of youve got to be kidding me, but lawrence watches him expectantly. adam sighs, then reaches in with his right hand, fishing around in the mess.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{oh man...(he gasps, making gagging sounds, his face turned away from the bowl. he coughs, fishes around for another brief moment, then quickly pulls back, trying to shake some of the shit off of his hand, spitting.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(expectantly) anything?}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(disgusted) no solids.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{take off the lid. (he points to the lid. adam looks to it, slowly stands up, reaches for it. lawrence has no patience.) come on!}
<A>__{adam takes off the lid, places it down on the toilet seat. the water is clearer inside, and he reaches in and pulls out something wrapped up in a black garbage bag. he holds it up for lawrence to see, turns to him.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i really wish i had checked in there first.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{huh. (he smiles slightly) what is it?}
<A>__{adam tears into the bag, reaches in and pulls out two hacksaws. he drops the bag on the floor, bends down and takes up his chain, holding one of the hacksaws and beginning to saw at the chain with it. lawrence watches him for a moment.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{hey! (adam turns and looks. lawrence speaks in an irritated voice) mind passing me the other one?}
<A>__{adam reaches over and picks up the other hacksaw, then carefully throws it across the room. it hits the pipe to lawrences left. lawrence reaches down and picks it up, then sits down on the floor. quick shot back to adam, who, while lawrence is preoccupied with picking up the hacksaw, quickly picks up the garbage bag and tosses it into the bathtub. both men start to saw away at their chains furiously, but neither are making any progress. suddenly, adams saw snaps in the middle, and his temper flares.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(enraged) fuck! fuck! (he reacts violently,}
<D>__{hitting the broken saw twice against the iron pipe then turns and hums it across the room, right into a mirror. a small piece of the mirror breaks off}
<P>__{and flies to the floor.)}
<A>__{lawrence glances over at what adam has done, then goes back to sawing for another moment. adam sits back down, breathing heavily, leaning against the pipe in his corner. finally, lawrence gives up, turning and sitting with his back against the pipe, also breathing heavily for a moment. he sits there, when a look of realization comes across his face. he holds up the saw, looking at it, understanding. he lowers it to the floor, shaking his head slightly.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(everything is becoming more clear now)}
<D>__{he doesnt want us to cut through our chains. he wants us to cut through our feet. (adam looks up at him, eyebrows raised.) i think i may know whos done this to us.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what did you say? (he stands up; is}
<P>__{lawrence hiding something from him?)}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{its not someone i know personally. its...just someone i know of.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(getting slightly frantic again) jesus}
<D>__{christ! tell me, who is it?!}
<A>__{the camera closes up on lawrences face. to the right of it, the screen is fading into a flashback of a crime scene. as lawrence speaks, his face fades and the flashback scene grows clearer, until it is only the crime scene, with three detectives walking down a flight of stairs.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{the last i heard...the police still hadnt caught him.}
<A>__{we now see the three figures descending through a trap door down a flight of stairs. the lighting is a bright lime green that is strangely dark at the same time. the trio enters a small, cell like room with a low ceiling. they are tapp, sing, and kerry. tapp is a tall black man in his late forties early fifties. sing is an asian man in his mid to late thirties, and kerry is a caucasian woman in her mid to late thirties with long, curly brown hair that is tied back in a ponytail. all are well dressed, sing and tapp in suits, the woman in a jacket and dress slacks. they are the detectives working on this case. as they move into the room, sing sees something that brings a look of shock to his face, shining a flashlight on it. we cannot see it yet.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(vo) and the only reason i know that}
<D>__{is because i was a suspect.}
<A>__{tapp comes into the room last, ducking slightly from his height, and comes up alongside sing, looking at the same thing.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(vo) ill start from the beginning.}
<C>__{kerry}
<D>__{this ones not fresh anymore. at least three weeks out. (detective tapp squints}
<P>__{as he peers in and studies the body)}
<D>__{victims a 46 year old male. (quick flash of a crime scene photo, a closeup of behind the mans head and upper back. there are deep cuts all over. the camera cuts upwards to the detectives.) died of massive blood loss. mostly through the femoral artery. (the camera pans around to detective tapp, who moves around the side fo the cage to get a better look inside, shining his flashlight in.) he started at the back of the cage and tunneled his way through the razor wire so fast its amazing he got as far as he did. cut himself so deep, we found traces of stomach acid on the floor. (another more gruesome crime scene photo shot of the body from the side; we can see the razor wire digging in under his arm. also, a close up shot}
<P>__{of some of his wounds; long, deep cuts.)}
<D>__{we also found this. (she holds up an evidence baggie with a micro cassette tape recorder, just like the one adam and lawrence found in their cell. she presses the play button, and tapp and sing listen. its the same chilling}
<P>__{voice from adam and lawrences tapes.)}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(on tape) hello paul. you are a perfectly}
<D>__{healthy, sane, middle class male. yet last month, you ran a straight razor across your wrists. did you cut yourself because you truly wanted to die, or did you just want some attention? tonight, youll show me. the irony is that if you want to die, you just have to stay where you are. but if you want to live, youll have to cut yourself again. (flashback shot of paul waking up in the cage, looking around, scared and confused. the shots go back and forth between the detectives and the paul flashback, with him grabbing and shaking the razor wire, screaming. his screams sound distant under jigsaws voice.) find the path through the razor wire to the door. but hurry. at 3:00 that door will lock and then this room becomes your tomb. how much blood will you shed to stay}
<P>__{alive, paul? (end)}
<C>__{kerry}
<P>__{(stopping the tape) the door was on}
<D>__{a timer. it was unlocked until 3:00. then it slammed shut. he was given two hours.}
<A>__{cut back to detective tapp, who notices something and shines his light on it. we see a strange wound on pauls body, a piece of flesh carved out into the shape of a jigsaw piece.}
<C>__{tapp}
<D>__{jigsaw piece. (sing looks in as well, see it. there is a quick flash of crime scene photos showing a close up of the wound. tapp sighs.) i think were gonna be here for a while, sing. (sing looks to him. we get another quick crime scene}

<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(vo) the newspapers started calling}
<D>__{him the jigsaw killer.}
<A>__{cut back to lawrence in the bathroom. for his next two spoken lines, the shot switches back and forth between him and the detectives in the razor wire room.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{actually, technically speaking, hes not really a murderer. he never killed anyone.}
<A>__{sing, wearing gloves, gets in the cage and examines pauls body a bit. a flash of another crime scene photo of the wound with a ruler held up to it is shown. more gruesome crime scene photos of that and other wounds are flashed across the screen.}

<D>__{and then i saw the body.}
<A>__{we switch back into amandas cell. over her shoulder, we see near the corner the body of a man lying on the floor on his back. amanda cautiously approaches it, the timer still ticking away, her hands still at the device. she kneels down cautiously next to him. she reaches down and with a shaking hand lifts up his shirt, revealing a large, black question mark drawn on his abdomen. she sobs harder, hunched over him. quick cut to the interrogation room, amanda in the center of the shot.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{there was a knife.}
<A>__{back to the cell. amanda, still leaning over, picks up a small knife next to the body. she slowly brings it up in both of her shaking hands, clutching it. she looks closer at it. a quick shot of the timer shows it to be at 25 seconds now, almost halfway. the camera moves to a shot of the mans face, when... he opens his eyes and starts to wake up. he moans, unable to speak or move. his eyes slowly, groggily look around a bit. he cannot even open his mouth; someone has very heavily drugged him. he sees amanda over him with a knife and his eyes widen; he tries to moan at her to stop, to not do what shes about to do, but she turns the knife upside down in both hands and quickly stabs down. he moans in agony in the background as she stabs down again, and again, and again. blood splashes on her hands. a quick shot back of lawrence as he listens, his mouth open slightly, eyes wide, staring at her. cut back to amanda in the cell as she stabs down a few more times. then back again to the table in lawrences interrogation room. sing throws down an evidence baggie with a used syringe in it.}

<D>__{ive been the last thing i said to my daughter.}
<A>__{lawrence turns away from adam, placing his hand on the pipe behind him, and the shot moves up into blackness, then up at the foot of a little girls bed in a darkened bedroom. the little girl is diana. shes about 5 or 6 years old, with long, wavy light brown hair. she lays tucked in with her eyes closed, her favourite teddy bear wrapped in her left arm. the camera moves up and over her a bit, moving in closer to her. chimes can be heard tinkling very faintly against a soft breeze. as the shot pauses just above her, her eyes suddenly open, blinking away sleepiness. she sits up, pulling away the covers, still holding her teddy bear. she remains sitting in her bed, staring over into the dark corner to her right. the chimes jingle away. we move in closer to her face; something has her spooked. a clock ticking is suddenly heard as the image fades from diana getting out of bed into a strange, mechanical looking clock on the living room wall of the gordon household. the shot lowers and we see the nicely furnished living room of the gordon home. the walls are a dark, crimson red, the furniture in tones of red and brown. it definitely is the living room of a well off family. not too cold, but not as warm and homey as it could be. diana slowly makes her way across the living room towards her parents bedroom, moving almost dream like, her teddy bear hanging limply from her right hand. she moves to the frosted glass double doors of her parents room, opening them both into the bedroom, where we see her mother, alison, laying on her side, fast asleep. alison is in her early to mid thirties with long blond hair going just past her shoulders and very pretty despite her sleepiness and messy hair in this scene. diana moves into the room, standing next to the bed, saying nothing, just watching her mother sleeping. alisons eyes slowly open; the feeling of being watched plus the instincts of a mother have awoken her. she reaches over and turns on the light, looking upon her daughter with concern.}

<C>__{alison}
<P>__{(softly) you know what sweetie? ill}
<D>__{go check with you.}
<A>__{they turn, slowly start to walk away as lawrence quickly finishes typing, then closes the laptop.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{nope! im done. (he smiles, turning}
<P>__{to look at them.)}
<A>__{cut to dianas room. lawrence reaches over and turns on the lamp on dianas side table. diana lies in bed, slightly propped up against her pillows and stuffed animals. lawrence sits on the side of her bed.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(very reassuringly) see? (he pulls the covers up over her, up to her chest.)}
<D>__{theres no one in your room. theres no such thing as the bad man. now can you go to sleep?}
<C>__{diana}
<D>__{im still scared.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{you are? give me your tootsie. (he pulls back the covers and she pulls out her foot. he takes it in his hand.) oh, what a big tootsie. (he turns to her, raising his eyebrows up) remember this one? (he counts on her toes as he says the following) this little piggy went to market, this little piggy stayed home, this little piggy had roast beef, this little piggy had none, and this little piggy went weeee! (he tickles}
<P>__{up her leg to her tummy and she giggles)}
<D>__{all the way home!}
<A>__{just then, lawrences beeper goes off. he leans back, takes it out and looks at it.}
<C>__{diana}
<D>__{i hate that thing.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{well i have to go to work, sweetheart. you know what daddys job is like. now, come on. (he re tucks her in, she smiles at him.) lets see. try and get some sleep now, okay? (he gives her a kiss,}
<P>__{smiles, stands up and goes to the door.)}
<C>__{diana}
<D>__{youre not going to leave us, are you, daddy?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(suddenly concerned) what? (he stops}
<D>__{at the door, turns, goes back over to her bed, sits down next to her and leans over. this was the last thing hed expected her to say) what are you talking about? you mean, leave you and mommy? (she nods; he reaches up and gently brushes her hair away from her face.) no, no sweetheart, i would never do that. who gave you that idea?}
<C>__{diana}
<D>__{no one.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{well its not true, okay?}
<C>__{diana}
<P>__{(very softly) okay.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{how much do i love you?}
<A>__{he moves his face closer to her and together they say}
<D>__{lawrence & diana love you very much}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{thats right, thats right! (he gives her a kiss, pulls back.) good night, sweetie.}
<C>__{diana}
<D>__{good night, daddy.}
<A>__{lawrence gets up and goes to the door, flipping the lights off. he pauses before he steps out.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{tomorrow, ill read you your favourite story.}
<C>__{diana}
<P>__{(with a small smile) okay.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{okay. (he goes out.)}
<A>__{quick cut to the entrance hall of the gordon residence. lawrence walks towards the door, alison behind him. alisons voice starts to cut over the scene. her tone is very pissed off.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{i dont know how much longer i can do this, larry.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(sounds as though he has no idea what}
<D>__{she means) what, what are you talking about?}
<C>__{alison}
<P>__{(pissed, in disbelief) how can you walk}
<D>__{through life pretending that youre happy?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{i am happy.}
<C>__{alison}
<P>__{(confrontational) that is complete bullshit. (cut to a shot of diana, laying on her}
<D>__{side in her darkened room, clutching her teddy bear to her chest. her eyes are open, she can hear everything. we stay with her for the rest of alisons line, her voice now off a bit in the distance but still very audible) id rather you break down and tell me that you hated me. at least thered be some passion in it.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{would you like to see her? (he reaches into his pocket and takes out his wallet, throws it across the room to adam, who is sitting with his back against the wall, facing lawrence. adam picks up the wallet and opens it. he sees two pictures of diana, side by side. the one on the left is diana hugging a dog. the one on the right is a smiling portrait outside somewhere.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{shes beautiful.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(sighs, then looks up at lawrence) you}
<D>__{gonna have any more kids?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(a bit wearily, but not snobby) weve}
<D>__{talked about it, but uh, with our schedules, its difficult enough to concentrate on one. (the tone of his voice indicates that maybe hes starting to realize that he shouldve spent more time and}
<P>__{attention to his daughter.)}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(referring to the wallet) so wheres the lucky wife? (a small smile)}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{theres another picture behind the one youre looking at. (adam reaches behind the photo on the right and pulls another photograph out. lawrence smiles slightly as he speaks) its my favourite one because were all in it together. someone, usually me, has to hold the camera, which means im always missing from the photos.}
<A>__{cut to adam, looking at the picture he pulled out. his face is blank, but you can sense great disturbance behind it. cut to a shot of the photo he is holding. it is not the one lawrence described, but a polaroid of alison and diana bound and gagged, and the message regards with a jigsaw piece drawn next to it. he turns the photo over, and there is a message. as he reads it, jigsaw reads it aloud in a voiceover.}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(vo) x marks the spot. sometimes you}
<D>__{see more with your eyes shut.}
<A>__{adam does his best to hide what he has seen, looks up to lawrence.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{its uh, its not here.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(a slight disturbance from his momentary}
<D>__{nostalgic bliss) what?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{uh, this photo youre talking about...its not here.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(slightly surprised, reaching out his}
<D>__{hand for adam to toss the wallet.) really? are you sure?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{yeah. (tucking the picture in his right hand, he shifts slightly by lifting himself a bit with his right hand, sneakily putting the photograph down and tossing the wallet with his left hand. lawrence picks up the wallet and starts looking for it, creasing his brow in concern, while adam backs up against his wall, holding the photograph out of lawrences sight against a pipe he rests his arm}
<P>__{on as he looks at the photograph.)}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(disbelief, shaking his head) he...he}
<D>__{mustve taken it. i...}
<A>__{alisons voice over is heard as he says this and continues to look through the wallet, and we hear alisons voiceover from the scene in the main hall.}
<C>__{alison}
<P>__{(vo) how can you walk through life pretending}
<D>__{that youre happy?}
<T>__{cut to :}
<A>__{the main hall of the gordon residence, back to the earlier flashback of lawrence and alison. this time, we stay with them.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{i am happy. (he walks over to a chair, leaning over it as he puts something down, gets his briefcase ready to go to work. alison stands a few feet behind him, trying her best to get him to react,}
<P>__{to stop the bullshit and end the masquerade.)}
<C>__{alison}
<P>__{(pissed) that is complete bullshit.}
<D>__{id rather you break down and tell me that you hated me. at least thered be some passion in it.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(tired of this, brushing it off as not}
<D>__{that important, like there really is nothing wrong) we can talk about this alter, okay? (he leans in to kiss her,}
<P>__{but she shakes her head. he pauses there.)}
<C>__{alison}
<P>__{(firmly) just leave.}
<A>__{he looks at her for a moment, searching, then slowly turns away and heads out the door.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{goodnight, little girl. (camera pans up closer into the closet, and we a widened blue eye and part of a face}
<P>__{(yet unidentifiable) watching her.)}
<A>__{the closet doors burst open and diana screams. cut back to the main hall where alison stands alone, her head lowered slightly. as soon as she hears the scream she turns and bolts towards her daughters room.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{diana!?}
<A>__{alison gets to just outside the door to her bedroom.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{diana! (opens the door and flips on the light, gasps when she sees a figure covered by a blanket looming over dianas bed. the figure suddenly grabs diana and she screams, struggling against him. alison goes for them.}
<A>__{quick cut to now, in alison and lawrences bedroom. waistline shot of a figure wearing a black coat, black leather gloves and blue jeans, holding a stethoscope. a gun is tucked into his belt and dianas teddy bear tucked under his arm. he saunters over to the gagged and bound diana and alison, on the floor and tied to a corner end of the bed. alison, her eyes streaming tears, struggles and pulls against her bonds to try to get at him but fails. diana keeps crying mommy! over and over again and sobbing. the figure crouches down beside diana, dropping the teddy bear behind her, his face still unseen. he takes the stethoscope and holds the end to dianas chest. the sound of a loud, steady heartbeat is heard. alison screams at him through her gag.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{dont do that! leave her! get away from her!}
<A>__{he pulls away the stethoscope and the heartbeat halts. he reaches with his right hand and pulls from his belt the gun. dianas screams become more desperate, alisons more frantic, more angry. he puts the stethoscope back against dianas chest and moves the gun up and down in front of her, then bringing it up to her mothers head. we hear the heartbeat again, doubled in speed.}
<C>__{alison}
<P>__{(through her gag) keep your motherfucking}
<D>__{hands off of my daughter!}
<A>__{he pulls away the gun and the stethoscope, tucking the gun back into his belt. he reaches down behind diana and picks up the teddy bear. as he does, we catch a brief glimpse of the lower half of his face, but not enough for a clear identification yet. he holds the teddy bear out in front of diana for a moment then tucks it in front of her. he pats her on the head and stands up, moving over to the window. he parts the curtains slightly and leans forward a bit, and we see his face more clearly. it is zep, the orderly from the hospital. cut to static, and then a surveillance video view of the exterior of the gordon home, of the window where zep is standing. the camera zooms in on him and we hear a raspy, male voice speaking.}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(vo as we view shot of zep) who are}
<D>__{you little man...i see you...(cut to a television screen with the video of zep in the window. fade back and to the right as we get a view of someones apartment. plastered on the walls are various photographs, which we can barely make out, and a desk in the corner with some recording equipment. as we move further right and hit the window we see detective tapp, leaning over the camera shooting the gordons window, adjusting the view. something about him seems just not right. we cut back to his view from the camera.) does dr. gordon know youre at home with his wife? i know you know something. (his voice goes up a bit louder) what are you doing in there? waiting for the doctor? im waiting for the doctor, too. hmm.}
<A>__{cut to a view over tapps couch of the television with zep on video on the screen. tapp walks over and sits down in front of the television, his back to us.}
<C>__{tapp}
<D>__{i never should have let you go...}
<A>__{camera pans up to a wall of articles, all about the jigsaw killings. it moves quickly and zooms in on each headline we see. jigsaw hunt brings d.a. before judge, missing man discovered at bizarre crime scene screaming is heard then a quick flashback shot of paul in his cage, first struggling against the wire then hanging dead in his cage killer preaching says top cop, psychopath teaches sick life lessons, quick shot of mark going around looking for the code on the walls, with the sound of his screaming over the shot, escape, victim survives maniacs game quick flashback footage of amanda in the interrogation room, then fighting with her mask, and a shot of lawrence watching and listening to her testimony, doctor questioned in case flash of shots of lawrence being questioned by the tapp and sing and then his lawyer. it ends on the flashback shot of tapp looking back at lawrence through the two way glass after amanda tells her story, and the shot slides into a shot of a car pulling up alongside a building.}
<C>__{tapp}
<P>__{(vo, fading, hushed against soundtrack)}
<D>__{i never shouldve let you go...}
<A>__{the car pulls up alongside a building, with lawrence in the passenger seat, and tapp driving. lawrences awkwardness, tapps distrust, and general uncomfortable tension can be easily detected between them.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(pretending like hes trying to be helpful,}
<D>__{really just glad to be out of tapps company) here we are. that was uh, quite an amazing story that poor woman told.}
<P>__{(tapp just nods, says nothing. lawrence}
<D>__{smiles very uncomfortably, gets out}
<P>__{of the car.)}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(leaning down and looking back into}
<D>__{the car window.) look, im sorry i cant be of more help to your investigation.}
<C>__{tapp}
<P>__{(nods very slightly) you know, we arrested}
<D>__{a dentist last week who like to play with kids a bit too much. he lived two blocks from here. the sewer lines run under this neighborhood too, doctor.}
<P>__{(hint hint)}
<A>__{lawrence stands straight up, walks away. tapp waits a moment, then drives off. bam into static and then the video from amandas cell. we are not at tapps desk in the police station, watching him obsessively watch the video, staring at the screen, remote control in hand. as he watches, the camera circles around behind the television to give us a better view of our obsessed detective.}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(from the video) hello amanda. you dont}
<D>__{know me, but i know you. i want to play a game. heres what happens if you lose. theres a timer at the back of the device youre wearing. when the timer goes off, your mouth will be permanently ripped open.}
<A>__{in the background of the station we hear a couple of detectives talking, then sing walks in behind tapp, over to his own desk. he turns, watching tapp watch the screen. tapp stops and rewinds the tape.}

<P>__{(to the other detectives leaving) ill}
<D>__{catch you guys down there. (he reaches}
<P>__{over and gets something off of his desk)}

<A>__{tapp fast forwards a bit, hits play.}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(from video) ill show you...}
<A>__{tapp watches closely the demonstration of the timer then the device going off and exploding. sing watches too, not paying as close attention. as soon as it explodes, sing speaks. the look on his face and the tone of his voice indicates his growing concern for his partners obsession over this case.}
<C>__{sing}
<D>__{hey tapp?}
<A>__{tapp doesnt look up, resembles lawrence in the earlier scene when alison and diana came to him to check her room while he was working on his paper.}

<P>__{(looks at the screen, thinks a minute)}
<D>__{ah...k2k. that gangs territory was only about four blocks.}
<C>__{tapp}
<D>__{now listen to this.}
<A>__{they listen with the volume up high. over the static, the sound of a fire alarm can just barely be heard in the background. they look at each other. tapp hits stop.}

<P>__{(vo) on the night of tuesday, the 17th,}

<P>__{(vo) yeah, well, so will anybody else.}
<A>__{a shot of inside the factory, various clutter and tables piled up on one another. no signs of life...yet. a bang from the outside of the door is heard. a couple more bangs and a shot of the giant, sliding wooden door as it slides open, and sing steps in, holding out his shotgun, ready for anything waiting for them. cut up to a staircase, lit by eerie green light, the same as from pauls razor wire room, as the detectives make their way up cautiously, tapp in front, sing covering behind them. they come up another level, one that has been recently used we see as tapp points over to a desk with a computer, a radio, and some other miscellaneous items. then, right next to the desk, we see the k2k graffiti from the video.}
<C>__{tapp}
<D>__{i got you...}
<A>__{they continue on, moving into a room separated with a chain link fence. there is a slightly raised platform, going along part of the wall, with a few steps leading up on either side. tapp goes up the steps. on the raised area are some tables covered in heavy red cloth. tapp points to one, reaches down, and pulls back the covering. he reveals a small diorama of the bathroom scene where adam and lawrence dolls, complete with the body, dolls representing each of them.}

<D>__{what the hell is this?.......(his voice almost a whisper) oh shit...}
<A>__{they move onto the next table, and tapp pulls back the cloth covering that one, revealing the leering puppet from amandas video. tapp stares at it wide eyed. next to the puppet is a strange, boar like mask with long dark hair. the camera pans back so we have the view of another large object covered in red cloth that tapp and sing had passed by. tapp leans in closer to look at the puppet, when suddenly the still covered form starts to move and muffled moaning sounds are heard. it startles the detectives.}
<C>__{sing}
<D>__{oh fuck!}
<A>__{they both go over and stand on either side of it, taking one end of the red cloth whipping it off. underneath is a man tied to a chair with duct tape over his mouth, held in place by a manacle around his neck. a contraption on the chair holds two power drills about six inches from either side of his head, pointed directly at his temples. his eyes wide, he moans through his tape at the detectives. suddenly, a door is heard clanging open on the other side of the building, and the detectives spin to face the sound, guns ready.}

<A>__{jigsaw continues moving, so sing fires. he hits, and jigsaw goes down. sing pauses, waiting to see if he gets back up. jigsaw doesnt move, so sing cocks the gun again and starts to slowly move forward towards him. cut to a shot of tapp as he struggles to his feet and starts towards the stairs to follow sing. back to sing, moving further down the hall. he gets about halfway down it when we see a shot of his feet just at a trip wire. over it are some cobwebs hanging down. he reaches to part them, and steps forward into the wire. as he steps we see a shot of a shotgun with wire slowly pulling down on the trigger. sing looks up, and the trigger of that gun and six other shotguns pointing down directly at him fire. sing is hit, blood splattering against him and the wall. we see only from his shoulders down. he spasms for a moment, then falls forward to his knees. cut to tapp, who is making strange vowel sounds, moving down the flight of stairs just before the hallway where sing now is. on his knees, sing remains upright for a moment, spasming more. we go to a shot of jigsaw on the floor. jigsaw starts moving and gets himself up to his feet, and starts hobbling further down the hall. sings body finally falls forward onto the floor, spasming still. tapp continues down the stairs, falling against the wall a couple of times. we see jigsaw as he gets to the end of the hall and starts sliding a large door open. at that moment, tapp reaches the bottom of the stairs and turns into the hallway, collapsing back into a sitting position on the stairs. jigsaw hobbles through the door and starts to go left. tapp sits up a bit and looks down the hall, where he sees sing, who has stopped spasming. his eyes widening, tapp removes the hand from his throat and reaches forward towards sing, his mouth opening and moving but no sound other than some gasping coming out. the shot fades to a slow paced black and white, and then snaps into a few crime scene photos of sings body, including a nice gory one of the top of his head, part of which is now missing. at the last photoflash, we cut back to a shot of tapp presently, sitting on his couch. the shot shows a good view of the scar across his neck.}

<A>__{flashback to adam walking up the stairs in his apartment building, a camera around his neck, smoking a cigarette and listening to music on his headphones. he walks with an uncaring, slow swagger. he gets to the top of the stairs and walks down a red lit hallway to his apartment. he goes inside, closing the door behind him then moving into the kitchen area, throwing his keys onto the table and opening the fridge. the entire apartment is very rundown, decrepit, dingy and old; truly a shithole apartment as adam described it earlier. there is graffiti on the door and walls, the wallpaper is fading and peeling, the refrigerator is dirty. adam opens the fridge and looks inside for a moment. he sighs, then closes the door. he heads over to his darkroom, closing the door behind him. the lighting is dark red. he puts the camera down on the table, taking the strap off from around his neck, takes off his headphones and cd player, presses stop and puts them down off to the side. he sighs tiredly and goes over to a tray where a photo is developing and picks it up with his fingers, ganging it with a closepin on a hanging line with other photos. it is a picture of a man wearing sunglasses. the man is in fact lawrence. to the left of that one is a shot of lawrence in the parking garage with his hand over his eyes. the camera cuts to a shot of the newest photo through a peephole in the darkroom door as the camera fades out and back, viewing the grafittied door of the darkroom before the shot fades to black, industrial music playing over the shot. cut to adam sleeping in the now pitch black darkroom, his head down on the table. he wakes up abruptly, as though he hadnt meant to fall asleep. he looks around, confused, wondering why all the lights out. he gives a great, another problem type of sigh. he stands and yawns, reaching over for the lightswitch. he moves it up and down a few times, but nothing happens. another aggravated sigh. he reaches down and finds a flashlight on the counter, presses the on button but it doesnt work. pissed, he shakes it hard, trying to get it to come on, but that doesnt work. he looks at it, scoffs.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{great.}
<A>__{suddenly, he hears something move outside the door, somewhere in his apartment. on alert, he listens. he looks down and picks up his camera, slinging it around his neck and holding it out in front of him. he opens the creaky door into his also pitch black apartment. he takes a few steps forward, speaks nervously, but trying to be brave.}

<A>__{lawrence holds the other end of the shirt in his mouth, biting it for a brace. the look in his eyes is one of complete madness and desperation. he takes up the hacksaw in his right hand, puts it against his ankle and starts to saw into his foot while adam begins to scream in complete horror. lawrence screams through the cloth between his teeth. the blood squirts up onto lawrences shirt and neck. adam collapses to the floor in his corner, screaming and wincing. back to zep rounding another corner in the hallway. he moves into an old break room and tapp runs in after him, finally catching up. tapp tackles him, tripping him backwards and causing zep to hit his head against and old mini refrigerator. tapp grabs him and brings him up, throwing him hard against the stone wall. zep falls down to his side. tapp grabs him up and throws him forward against a cage wall. back to lawrence, still sawing away, blood on his face, neck and shirt. back to tapp pummeling zep from behind in the back. a look of twisted glee is upon tapps face as he hits zep. zep falls to the floor, gun beside him. he looks like he just wants to curl up and die. tapp goes down for the gun but zep reacts, grabbing it. tapp grabs his hand, and zep pushes himself up into a standing position, the wall in front of him, tapp pushing up behind him, trying to take the gun. back in the bathroom, adam is on his hands and knees, screaming and crying as he begs lawrence to stop. lawrence does stop, sits up and tosses the saw of to the side. adam collapses forward a bit. back to zep and tapp, who continue struggling from the gun. zep squeezes his way down, groaning as he suddenly drops down between tapp and the wall, his gun aimed up at tapp. he pulls the trigger and the shot hits tapp in the chest, a loud surprise to the former detective. back in the bathroom, lawrence crawls along the floor, moaning. he finds and picks up the single bullet from his envelope, looks at it. adam watches him in terror.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(screaming crying) what are you doing?! (lawrence crawls on farther, towards the body.)}
<A>__{cut back to a close up of the bloody hole in tapps chest. tapp remains standing a moment, in shock, gasping, then falls down backwards onto the floor. zep is still on his knees, holding the gun up at a diagonal. tapps eyes flutter, then finally close. zep turns and gets up, limping in pain out of the room and down another hall. back in the bathroom, lawrence reaches the body. he takes the gun, opens the chamber.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what are you...(he suddenly realizes lawrences intentions. his eyes go wide,}
<P>__{and he starts to cry out and beg.)}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{oh my god! oh my god! lawrence dont!}

<D>__{my family...(he aims and pulls the trigger, hitting adam in the upper chest area. adam falls down forward onto the floor,}
<P>__{his screams stop.)}
<A>__{lawrence collapses, sobbing. then he sits up a bit, turning to the surveillance camera and screaming.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{ive done it! now show them to me! (he continues to cry, dropping the gun next to him, collapsing back down with his}
<P>__{forehead to the floor.)}
<A>__{cut to the gordons neighbors living room. alison paces back and forth, holding a cell phone to her ear. two neighbors sit off to the side on a couch with diana.}

<P>__{(reassuringly) its all right. ive}
<D>__{called the police. everythings okay.}
<A>__{alison goes and sits on the couch. diana comes up to her, and alison embraces her daughter. cut back to the bathroom, with a shot of the sliding door. the sound of a lock being undone and a bang is heard. lawrence pushes himself up into a kneeling position, a look of shock on his face. the door slides open and there stands zep, green mist behind him in the hallway. lawrence turns and sees him. zeps eyes dart around the room, seeming to say what the fuck happened in here? he sees lawrence on the floor, and an eager look comes into his eyes. he walks in, and lawrence starts to yell at him.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{you bastard! ill fucking kill you!}
<P>__{(lawrence grabs zeps leg as he passes}
<D>__{but is too weak and zep pulls away, looking down at him, moving over to the other side of the body) ill fucking kill you! you fucking bastard! (lawrence quickly cralws forwarrd and takes up the gun, pulling the trigger several times, but there are no more bullets. it just clicks.) ill fucking kill you! you fucking bastard! ill fucking kill you! ill fucking kill you!}
<A>__{zep goes over to adam, pushing his side with his foot a couple of times, but to no reaction. he then looks to lawrence and aims his gun at him, shaking his head.}

<D>__{youre too late.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(weakly) why?}
<C>__{zep}
<D>__{its the rules.}
<A>__{zep is about to pull the trigger when suddenly adam comes to and grabs his ankle, pulling him down. the back of zeps head hits the floor hard. adam pulls him towards him, struggles to get the gun from zeps hand, screaming. the gun goes off once off to the side. adam moves zeps arm back and forth, and it goes off again. finally, adam slams zeps arm down and gets the gun away from him, tossing it away. he slugs zep hard across the face, stunning him. lawrence starts crawling towards them. screaming like a madman, adam sits up and grabs the toilet seat lid from the toilet, and slams it down onto zeps head as hard as he can. he repeats this seven times before the lid snaps in half. lawrence reaches the two and reaches up for adams arm as adam brings the broken lid down again. lawrence grabs his arm and adam drops the lid, falling forward a bit and clutching his shoulder wound with his free hand, crying hard. lawrence moves in, touching his head to adams.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(his voice very weak and shaky) youre}
<D>__{going to be all right. (adam stops sobbing for a moment) youre just wounded in the shoulder. i have to go and get help.}

<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(he pauses, turns to look back at adam)}
<D>__{dont...dont worry, ill bring someone back, i promise. (he continues crawling on, out the door while adam watches him pathetically, still crying and reaching}
<P>__{out for him.)}
<A>__{lawrence makes it out the door, and starts dragging himself down the hall. adam is now alone in the room with two corpses. adam looks to the door one more time then turns to zeps body. he pulls himself on top of him, wincing at his shoulder pain.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(thinking) key...key...}
<A>__{he starts going through zeps pockets, patting him down. he finds zeps wallet, opens it and feels through it; there s nothing of value to him right now. he tosses it down. he continues feeling for something, suddenly feels something in zerps coat pocket. his eyes widen as he reaches in, wincing from the pain in his shoulder. he pulls out a tape recorder. he stares at it, his eyes and mouth starting to widen. he glances down at zep, then at the tape recorder. sitting up a bit more, he presses play. it is jigsaws voice.}
<C>__{jigsaw}

<A>__{back to the shot of adam staring at him, shocked. suddenly, adam looks down, grabs zeps gun and aims for john. but before he can pull the trigger john holds out the remote for the electricity and starts to electrocute adam, who starts jerking around and drops the gun. as he spasms, a very, very fast montage of images from the entire film from beginning to the end, starting with a shot of adam being electrocuted after his fake death, then lawrence, then going back to the beginning, all the way up and ending with adam stretched out on top of zep, spasming still from the electrocution. suddenly the electricity stops and he gasps, raspy loud breathing. john turns away, starts towards the door. adam can only watch after him.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(vo) most people are so ungrateful to}

<A>__{adam screams as loud as he can in terror and despair as john pauses for a moment with the door halfway shut, and says}

<C>__{game over.}
<A>__{john slams the door shut the rest of the way, and we are left in darkness with the sound of adam screaming no! dont!!! over and over and crying. the screams fade out, and is replaced by the ending titles and instrumental music.}
