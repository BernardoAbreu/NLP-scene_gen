<L>__{interior apartment building n night}
<A>__{moving slowly across a neutral colored wall.}
<C>__{detective atwood }
<D>__{thank you for your time.}
<A>__{a door is closed. we come to the corner and are looking down a hallway at atwood coming toward us. we move to her and arrive just as she raises her fist to knock. before she can, the door opens and she and mr. smith who is on his way out of his apartment are surprised that the other one is suddenly there. each one takes a half step back. phwap! the manila envelope that was wedged under mr. smith's left arm hits the floor.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{oh! you scared me.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{i'm sorry...}
<P>__{(bends down and picks up the envelope)}
<D>__{... i was about to knock. i'm detective atwood with the chicago police.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<P>__{(accepting the envelope)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{through the open door, atwood can see mr. smith's camera on a table and the collapsed tripod leaning against the wall.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{are you a photographer...}
<P>__{(glances at her list)}
<D>__{mr. baffert?}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{no... eh, it's kind of a hobby, i just started.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{i don't know if you're aware but there was a murder...}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{oh, yes in the house across the alley...}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{did you happen to see anything unusual or suspicious that night around that house? anything at all?}
<A>__{mr. smith puts on his thinking expression and pauses a little bit before:}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{no... i wondered that when i heard what happened, but... no.}
<P>__{(looks at his watch)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i'm meeting someone and i don't want to be late.}
<A>__{he moves into the hallway closing the door behind him.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{here's my card, if you hear anything or remember anything.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<P>__{(taking the card)}
<D>__{i wish i could be of more help, but sorry.}
<A>__{watching him walk away amid the crinkle of his raincoat, detective atwood, maybe because of her woman's intuition or maybe because she's a good cop, wonders what is in that manila envelope under his arm. the thought is gone almost as soon as it comes and she faces about to the next door.}
