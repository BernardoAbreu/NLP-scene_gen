<ACTION>__{The bucolic magnificence of the Devon countryside. We fly low over the high, thick hedges untouched for hundreds of years. The thick verdant countryside in all its splendor, ancient woodlands, fields of corn, and finally a paddock in a typical Devonshire dale. We come to rest beside three farmers standing over a pregnant mare. The mare is in distress - she is about to give birth. The farmers calm the mare and tend to her gently with assurance and authority. We pull back to see, ALBERT, a fifteen-year-old farm boy, watching the whole drama with delight from the paddock gate.}

<ACTION>__{Moments later - the summer's sun glints off the wet, sticky hide of the foal (JOEY) - red hide, four white socks and a distinctive white cross on its forehead. Soon the creature is attempting its first clumsy steps. It is both awesome and comical to see the new born creature struggle to his feet, but eventually, he succeeds. Title: WAR HORSE}
<LOC>__{EXT. PADDOCK/FIELD, DEVON. VARIOUS.}
<ACTION>__{We follow Joey's progress over the course of his first year. His initial fearfulness, his connection with his mother, the intimacy of their relationship. As Joey gets strong they run together, frolicking gayly in the last dregs of summer. Albert looking on. Joey notices him at the fence and they share a moment of connection. Spring: flowers are beginning to sprout by the hedgerows. Our boy Albert runs into the field. He takes an apple from his pocket - he holds it out tentatively. Joey approaches Albert with suspicion. Albert gently encourages him. His mother paws the ground and neighs at Joey. He turns and runs over the field at her beck and call. Albert tosses the apple to himself, ruefully - watches in awe as Joey races away with his mother. He is a magnificent one year old. His distinctive red coat gleaming, now it is clear that he is half thoroughbred. He runs quickly around the field enjoying his own power and strength. Later - the three farmers open the gate and come into the field. Both Joey and his mother instinctively canter over to the two men, expecting food. The three men gently greet the horses and pet them, then we see one man has a noose made of a rope. He slips it round Mum's neck. She pulls back, Joey is shaken and bewildered but before he knows what's happening the second farmer is trying to get a similar rope around his neck. Joey balks and pushes the farmer aside, distressed to see his mother tethered. The farmer grabs Joey again and struggles with him, enlisting the help of the second farmer. With some effort they get the rope around his neck and calm him down.}

<ACTION>__{Unused to being tethered Joey pulls at the rope but the farmers are solid and firm. They gently lead Joey and his mother across the field to the gate and out into the road. The whole road becomes overtaken by a flock of sheep on their way to the market. In the distance we hear the bustle of Market Day.}
<LOC>__{EXT. THE MARKET. THE SAME.}
<ACTION>__{The farmers lead Joey and his mother through the chaos of the market and into an auction pen. They find themselves amongst a hoard of pigs, sheep and cows. Joey is agog at all of these creatures and all this life he had no idea existed. The farmers lead the horses into a stall to await the auction. Joey is bewildered by all the noise - buttressed against a couple of mules and a cow. He is uncomfortable in this tight space. An AUCTION WORKER holds a clipboard out for the lead farmer.}

Just behind Si is his 15 year old son, ANDREW. Ted has a drink in his hand. They all look at Joey bridling against the men who are trying to hold him.}

We would always know him by the red pennant Nicholls tied on his saddle. Joey is now running through the German lines. No one bothers to attack him as the German's concentrate their efforts on the cavalry behind him. The line of machine guns fire as one, decimating the horses and their riders.

A sudden barrage of machine gun fire all around him. Cut back to Albert, who makes his way to the edge of the shell hole. Bullets whizz inches from his head.

The tank is about to crush Joey. He has left it too late. He is about to die. But then, counter-intuitively, he runs straight towards the tank and...leaps over it - a leap he learnt from Emilie.

Another explosion sends him leaping, but not far enough - he finds himself crashing downwards, and into a trench - and he races through it - and finds himself charging towards a German company. Both sides are equally startled - Joey charging through a thin trench lined with German soldiers - the soldiers, finding a live horse careering through them. In desperation, Joey scrambles out of the trench - and once again, rushes away from the fighting... But now it is very dark indeed - he is stumbling as he runs - there is blood mixed with the mud on his legs. Now it is total night - fog - confusion - he jumps again. And now everywhere there are potholes - the land is massively uneven - shells are exploding all around. And suddenly sees in front of him barbed wire. He crashes through it - more - he bursts through again - now dragging barriers behind him - the barriers tangle, pulling him up short - he flips and lands amongst even more barbed wire.
