<A>__{schaefer gasps as his eyes bolt open in fear. as if the hunter were still attacking, schaefer rolls to his feet and runs, slogging through the thick mud, stumbling, lunging forward, gasping for breath. schaefer spins and staggers backwards into a shallow pool, scuttling, crablike into the chest deep water. schaefer backs into the moss covered wall by the waterfall, looking for movement, regaining his senses. as the water settles, he looks down, seeing the image of himself, reflected in the pool; his hair and face covered in thick clay. he stares, mesmerized at the image. he lifts his arm from the water, his fingers wiping the mud from his face, exposing a patch of skin. he studies the mud in his hand and then looks at the image of himself in the water, seeing the exposed skin. he stares at it, a wave of realization rushing through his mind. he places the mud back on his face, again looking at his image.}
