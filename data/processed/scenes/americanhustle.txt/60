<A>__{irving and richie look at sydney, uncertain.}
<B>__{irving shakes his head in disgust and leaves. richie stares at sydney swinging her legs on the counter as she sits.}
<C>__{richie dimaso}
<D>__{you playing me? are we doing this? or you playing him? it'd be very bad for you if you're playing me.}
<C>__{edith greensly}

<C>__{richie dimaso}
<D>__{this is all very exciting, i never knew life could be like this. you're wild. you know we're taking down a very important politician.}
<A>__{richie stands very close to edith between her legs as she sits on the counter. he puts his hands on her hips, pulls her into him. he takes her hand puts it on his face, makes her feel his cheek and forehead with her hand. it is intense. she prepares for him to kiss her but he steps back. they are both excited. they stare at each other. the air is thick with tension, richie exhales and leaves.}
