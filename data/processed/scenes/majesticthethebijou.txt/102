<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{the same later adele and luke are slow dancing to "thanks for the memory."}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{how do you tell those two apart, anyway?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{alex and charlie? simple. alex is the smarter one.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{that's... pretty frightening.}
<A>__{they laugh and dance a bit more.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{your dancing's very good.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{it never used to be. you were two left feet on the dance floor. like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{guess i must've learned.}
<A>__{luke dances adele away, a slightly nonplussed expression on her face. the band finishes the song, and everyone enthusiastically applauds. spencer bows shyly, blushing slightly. he nods to the band, and they bow before he motions for the crowd's attention.}
<C>__{spencer}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{thanks, folks. gee, can you tell we never played in front of people before?}
<A>__{the crowd yells "no!," "you guys sound great!," etc.}
<C>__{spencer}
<D>__{well, this is our first time, and it's really all because of luke. i mean, it's because of luke coming back that we're here tonight but i'm talking about this.}
<A>__{he holds up the clarinet and scans the crowd until he sees luke.}
<C>__{spencer}
<P>__{(to luke)}
<D>__{when you didn't come back, i learned how to play this so i could remember you. and now that you're back, well, i will never forget you.}
<P>__{(to the crowd)}
<D>__{luke gave me this clarinet, but he gave this night to all of us.}
<A>__{the crowd applauds warmly.}
<C>__{spencer}
<D>__{okay folks, here's mayor cole!}
<A>__{the crowd applauds as ernie cole mounts the band riser. he turns and addresses avery wyatt, on drums.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{pretty proud of your boy, avery?}
<A>__{avery smiles broadly and beats the kick drum five or six times to register his reaction. on the kick drum "wyatt's hardware, lawson, calif."}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{looks like you might have to find someone else to mix paint at the store, 'cause i think spencer's got a big career ahead of him.}
<A>__{applause again, and ernie waits for it to settle. as soon as he starts speaking, the crowd becomes totally silent.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{you know folks, here in lawson, we gave a lot for our country. a lot. and we never complained and we never faltered. and we never forgot.}
<A>__{ernie's voice cracks slightly with emotion. he clears his throat and continues.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{we never forgot. and so when one of our own came back to us, i gotta tell you folks, it was like a miracle. luke, seein' you walking down the street, it was... well, it was kinda like seein' one of my boys alive again. i think i speak for everyone here when i say that not a day goes by when we don't keep our boys' memories alive. but luke, having you back among us... well, it helps us keep their spirits alive, too. god bless you, son.}
<A>__{the crowd applauds. adele takes luke's hand and smiles. ernie wipes his eyes and changes the subject.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{all right, enough a'that. this is a celebration, so let's have us a good time but not too good a time, 'cause i see just about every member of the city council here tonight, and we have an eight a.m. council meeting tomorrow morning, and i expect y'all to be there! all right, take it away, spencer!}
<A>__{and spencer kicks the band into the next tune as we}
