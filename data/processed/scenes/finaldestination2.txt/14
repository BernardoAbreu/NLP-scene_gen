<A>__{thomas sits at the computer terminal. he checks to make sure no one's watching as he enters a search for alex browning. ten websites come up, all devoted to the flight 180 curse. thomas scrolls around, seeing the death pix and autopsy photos of flight 180 "survivors". headlines blare, "freak accident?" "bizarre coincidence?" describing the way the victims died. as thomas begins a localized search of the word, "premonition" spooky humming from behind him. thomas whirls around to see det. suby looking over his shoulder, humming the music from an old monster movie. suby presses one hand to his forehead, the other polishing an apple against his vest.}
