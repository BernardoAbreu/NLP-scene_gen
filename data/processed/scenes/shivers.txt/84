<A>__{the vast and dimly lit garage is full of silent cars. somewhere an engine starts up, then another and another, until the whole garage is full of fumes and the revving of engines. as we prowl amongst the cars we find many of the residents we already know, now dressed to the teeth in their seductive best. mr. spergazzi and his wife stand and watch the spectacle, canes in hand, with great dignity. with them stand others who are too old or too young to go into the night looking for new hosts for their parasites, content to remain incubators for the time being. the residents are full of bubbly anticipation in their cars. kresimir leans out of his car and shouts to no one in particular.}
