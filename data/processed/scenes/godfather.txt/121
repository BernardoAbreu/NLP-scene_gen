<L>__{ext day: mancini bldg. (spring '46)}
<A>__{several cars are parked in front of a pleasant new york apartment building. we recognize a couple of sonny's bodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards against the curb. inside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of brass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile. up one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step, smoking a cigarette. one of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch, which is attached to a key chain. we hear the sound of a door opening; they look up. the man sitting on the stop stands; and looks. sonny backs out of an apartment, the arms of lucy mancini wrapped around him. she doesn't want to let go of him; she draws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he comes out alone, adjusting his clothes. he jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard on the first floor, and moves outside toward his car. the men quickly take up their positions. as he gets in his car:}
