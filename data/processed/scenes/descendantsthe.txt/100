<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what's he like?}
<C>__{cousin hugh}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{brian speer what else do you know about him?}
<C>__{cousin hugh}

<C>__{matt}
<D>__{not if we don't go with that bid.}
<A>__{cousin hugh's eyes emerge momentarily from their drunken fog to give matt a firm, steely warning.}
<C>__{cousin hugh}

<C>__{sid}
<D>__{this place rocks.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{totally.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{we ordered you mahi.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{great.}
<A>__{the music grows more frenetic. matt looks around the room, alienated from everything from the fried food and the tourists, from the umbrellas in the drinks, from his daughters enjoying the music and this cretin called sid. why can't a nuclear bomb blow the whole island up right now?}
