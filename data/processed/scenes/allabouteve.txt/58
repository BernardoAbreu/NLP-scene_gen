<L>__{interior dining hall sarah siddons society night}
<A>__{the stopped action of eve reaching out for the award. the applause and bulb popping still going on.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{and she gave the performance of her life. and it was a night to remember, that night...}
<A>__{the action picks up where it left off. eve accepts the award from the aged actor, kisses him tenderly, folds the award to her bosom and waits for quiet. she speaks with assurance, yet modestly and humbly.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{honored members of sarah siddons society, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: what is there for me to say? everything wise and witty has long since been said by minds more mature and talents far greater than mine. for me to thank you as equals would be presumptuous i am an apprentice in the theater and have much to learn from you all. i can say only that i am proud and happy and that i regard this great honor not so much as an award for what i have achieved, but as a standard to hold against what i have yet to accomplish.}
<P>__{(applause)}
<D>__{and further, i regard it as bestowed upon me only in part. the larger share belongs to my friends in the theater and to the theater itself, which has given me all i have. in good conscience, i must give credit where credit is due. to max fabian }
<A>__{max sits erect, beaming proudly.}
<C>__{eve's voice}
<D>__{ dear max. dear, sentimental, generous, courageous max fabian who took a chance on an unknown, untried, amateur...}
<A>__{eve, after applause greets max.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{and to my first friend in the theater whose kindness and graciousness i shall never forget... karen mrs. lloyd richards...}
<A>__{karen resumes her doodling as applause breaks out for her...}
<C>__{eve's voice}
<D>__{... and it was karen who first brought me to one whom i had always idolized and who was to become my benefactor and champion. a great actress and a great woman margo channing.}
<A>__{margo, part of eve's tribute has been over her close up. she smiles grimly in reaction to the applause. eve looks to her right, waits for the applause to die.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{my director who demanded always a little more than my talent could provide }
<A>__{bill, seated at the speakers' table. he has his award before him a smaller one. he puts out a cigarette expressionlessly as the applause breaks out.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{ but who taught me patiently and well... bill sampson.}
<A>__{lloyd sits beside bill. he, too, has a smaller award. as eve speaks, he throws her a brief glance.}
<C>__{eve's voice}
<D>__{and one, without whose great play and faith in me, this night would never have been. how can i repay lloyd richards?}
<A>__{eve waits for the applause to die.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{hoe can i repay the many others? so many, that i couldn't possibly name them all...}
<A>__{addison smiles approvingly.}
<C>__{eve's voice}
<D>__{... whose help, guidance and advice have made this, the happiest night of my life, possible.}
<A>__{eve stares at the award for an instant, as if fighting for self control.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{although i am going to hollywood next week to make a film do not think for a moment that i am leaving you. how could i? for my heart is here in the theater and three thousand miles are too far to be away from one's heart. i will be back to claim it and soon. that is, if you want me back.}
<A>__{another storm of applause. much ad lib shouting as bill and lloyd are summoned to pose beside her for more pictures. people are thronging out. the aged actor shouts above the hubbub...}
<C>__{aged actor}
<D>__{a good night to all and to all a good night!}
<A>__{eve disengages herself from the photographers, makes her way toward addison's table... bill and lloyd follow. camera follows lloyd to karen. they kiss. he gives her the award.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{for services rendered beyond the whatever it is of duty, darling.}
<A>__{max bustles into the shot.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{come on! i'm the host, i gotta get home before the guests start stealing the liquor...}
<A>__{she and lloyd follow max. addison and eve are on their way. lloyd goes right by. karen pauses at eve.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{congratulations, eve.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{thank you, karen.}
<A>__{karen goes. eve is being constantly congratulated. some ad lib about seeing her at max's party...}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(to addison)}
<D>__{i'm giving her a very high class party. it ain't like a rehearsal, she don't have to be late.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{as soon as the peasants stop pawing her.}
<A>__{max hurries out. margo and bill step into the shot. eve turns from a well wisher to face her.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{... nice speech, eve. but i wouldn't worry too much about your heart. you can always put that award where your heart ought to be.}
<A>__{eve looks at her wordlessly. margo and bill leave. addison and eve are alone. the tables about them are empty. suddenly, her face becomes expressionless, her eyes dull... she glances at the table.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i don't suppose there's a drink left...}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{you can have one at max's.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(sits)}
<D>__{i don't think i'm going.}
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{because i don't want to.}
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(patiently)}
<D>__{max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{no, it's not.}
<P>__{(she holds up the award)}
<D>__{it's for this.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{it's the same thing, isn't it?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{exactly.}
<P>__{(she gives him the award)}
<D>__{here. take it to the party instead of me.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{you're being childish.}
<A>__{a well wisher rushes up to eve with an "eve, darling, i'm so happy!" eve rises, thanks her graciously. then she pulls her wrap over her shoulder.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i'm tired. i want to go home.}
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(curtly)}
<D>__{very well. i shall drop you and go on to the party. i have no intention of missing it...}
<A>__{they exit from the room, now empty of everything but tables, waiters, and the usual banquet debris.}
