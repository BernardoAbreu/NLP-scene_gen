<L>__{interior rehearsal room day}
<A>__{the rehearsal room is filled with high energy as the choir is separated into several groups. christy has got the whole thing running like a disciplined broadway cast. mary patrick leads one group in the corner as they practice synchronized movements with tambourines. colorful streamers are tied to the tambourines, and they make colorful patterns in the air. sister alma pounds the piano with newfound energy, as mary robert and the sopranos reach higher and higher for notes they've only dreamed of in the past. christy and mary lazarus have corralled the rest of the nuns into a practice of intricate dance steps, somewhat like the temptations in skirts. mary lazarus keeps the beat with a yardstick.}
