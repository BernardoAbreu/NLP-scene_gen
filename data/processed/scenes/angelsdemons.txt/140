<A>__{they dash around the outer bulwark of the castle. the courtyard beneath them looks like a museum of ancient warfare catapults, stacks of marble cannonballs, fearful contraptions. as the cops quickly and silently search every nook, langdon and vittoria follow closely.}

<D>__{the vatican used this place for centuries as a hideout, a prison for enemies of the church there are passages and catacombs everywhere. it makes sense, the illuminati infiltrated the church's own stronghold. bernini was chief architect here, he left clues everywhere, it's even surrounded by a pentagonal park!}
<A>__{they reach the central core of the castle. another angel statue, similar to the one atop the citadel, stands in front of them, its sword held in the same position, pointing downward at an angle. langdon studies it, follows the line of the angel's sword and sees a gated drive that cuts across the courtyard itself.}

<D>__{there.}
<A>__{a moment later, he and vittoria are down in the courtyard, at the mouth of the gated drive. the gate is open and leads to a tunnel, a gaping entry in the central core.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{a traforo. commanders on horseback used them to ride directly into a castle from the outside.}
<A>__{he gestures to the nearby cops, who are already on it, and they all head into the darkened tunnel.}
