<C>__{castor}
<D>__{jon, i'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{and how much will your 'fun' net you this time?}
<A>__{boom boom boom! half blind shots send castor spinning. a moment later, archer pursues... snap! he fits a new clip into his pistol.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{what's it to you? i declare it. here i am, back in the states for less than a week }
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{you're under arrest. incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent }
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{i've got something going down on the eighteenth... it's gonna be worse than anything god ever dumped on the pharaoh. i will give it up but my brother and i have to walk.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{no discussion no deals.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{what're you gonna do with me locked up? you'll drive your wife and kid nuts! i bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. what's her name, janie?}
<A>__{enraged, archer steps boldly forward trying to draw his enemy out. silence then archer senses... castor is behind him. he fires archer dives away. the barrage continues driving archer back between two huge turbine engines. as archer reloads, he stares at the control panel switches. castor moves in for the kill when he hears a final snap snap. except it isn't a finger snap... it's two switches. vrrrrooom! the twin engines roar on! unable to fight the churning tornado force wind... castor's blasted across the hangar... slamming hard into the far wall. the engines stop and archer emerges joined by tito.}
<C>__{tito}
<D>__{tell me he didn't get away again...}
<A>__{then tito follows archer's gaze to castor's lifeless body. still as death somehow his mocking smile survives.}
