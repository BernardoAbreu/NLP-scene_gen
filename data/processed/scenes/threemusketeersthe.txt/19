<L>__{exterior streets of paris day}
<A>__{d'artagnan rides through the streets of paris. a country boy happily stunned by the sights, sounds, and smells of the city. merchants gossip and call to each other from shop doors. colorful vendors and pedestrians move along the crowded boulevard. acrobats, puppeteers, and jugglers perform on street corners. laughter and music drift from taverns and public houses. d'artagnan views it all with great enthusiasm. he sees the exterior of the musketeer headquarters... wow! the future belongs to him.}
<B>__{athos}
<A>__{he crosses the courtyard to a large wooden door. but as he reaches for the handle, the door flies open and smacks him in his injured arm.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(as he enters)}
<D>__{look out!}
<C>__{athos}
<P>__{(wincing in pain)}
<D>__{aaarrgghh...}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(in a panic; looking around)}
<D>__{where are they? where are the musketeers? i'm in the right place, aren't i?}
<C>__{athos}
<P>__{(through gritted teeth)}
<D>__{not as far as i'm concerned.}
<A>__{athos is wearing his cape in such a way that it hides his musketeer tunic. d'artagnan has no idea who he's dealing with.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{but this is musketeer headquarters...}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{no. this was musketeer headquarters.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{you mean it's been moved?}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{i mean the musketeers have been disbanded. feel free to poke around for souvenirs.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{what do you mean 'disbanded'?}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{some nonsense about being needed in the army. now if you'll excuse me...}
<A>__{d'artagnan blocks athos' path.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{but i just got here. how can i become a musketeer if they've been disbanded?}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{i'd say you've got a problem.}
<A>__{d'artagnan grabs athos by his injured arm. athos, stifling pain, fixes d'artagnan with a deadly look.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{you could use a lesson in manners.}
<A>__{d'artagnan touches his sword, eyes flashing at the possibility of a duel.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{any time.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{i'm in a hurry now but i will meet you at the carmes deshaux monastery at noon.}
<A>__{athos exits.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(calling after him)}
<D>__{i will be there ten minutes early.}
<C>__{d'artagnan }
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{an hour in paris, and i already have my first duel!}
<A>__{just then, d'artangnan spies two familiar figures on horseback, distinctive cloaks hiding their faces. anne and constance, though he does not yet know their names. d'artagnan hurries after.}
