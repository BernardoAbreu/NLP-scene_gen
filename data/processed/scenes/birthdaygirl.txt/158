<A>__{a fox cries out in the night.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{listen. i think it's a fox.}
<A>__{she listens. it cries out again. she gets out her binoculars.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{it sounds close.}
<A>__{she looks through them and searches the brush. john watches nadia with her binoculars. he looks suddenly very sad.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{i can't see anything. it's too dark.}
<A>__{she puts them back in her bag. john watches her. he sees her wrist again. she lights a cigarette, and blows the smoke into the air.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{what happened between you and the blonde?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{the thin... the girl with small eyes. the one in your cupboard.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's none of your business. she didn't have small eyes.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{did she leave you? come on. it's nothing to be ashamed of. who did she leave you for? your best friend? her boss? a woman? did she leave you for a woman, john?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{she's dead.}

<D>__{i don't know why i said that. she's not dead at all.}
<A>__{nadia looks at john.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't know why i said it. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{she's alive?}
<A>__{nadia starts to laugh. long and loud. we have never seen her laugh before.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{she's alive!! she is not dead?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{laugh it up.}
<A>__{she starts to cough. she gets on her hands and knees and coughs like fury.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you should stop smoking. you're pregnant. you smoke like a fucking lab dog.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{i'm trying to quit.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i've got news for you. it's not working.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{i smoke more these days. i smoke more when i'm unhappy.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{nobody's that unhappy.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{maybe i want to die. don't you want me to die?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't want anyone to die.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{except for small eyes.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{except for small eyes.}
<A>__{she laughs again.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{so why did it end?}
<A>__{john thinks. it looks as if he's going to tell the whole story. in the end he shrugs.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{what was her name?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<A>__{the fox cries out again.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{listen. it's definitely a fox. now i'm scared.}
<A>__{they listen to the fox crying in the night.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{you know you can come under the blanket.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's alright.}
<A>__{the scene from bird's eye view. john lies back and stares at the stars. nadia curls up on the other side of the fire, and hugs herself. we push down closer and closer until we are on john's face. the theme returns. the cricket boys from john's close stand in a line in the middle of the street, bathed in flashing blue light. we pan round and end on john's house. it is surrounded with police. police cars, police vans, plastic police tape "police line. do not cross." john's neighbours press against the tape as officers come and go. inside the house is full of police, ransacking his possessions and dusting fingerprints. a policeman is standing reading the english russian dictionary. we push on upstairs and along the landing to the spare room. an officer dumps a pile of porno magazines and videos on the bed. he then spots the belts tied to the bedstead and points them out to a detective. they exchange a knowing grin. a photographer steps up and snaps the paraphernalia in a blinding flash. the birthday cake is there, half eaten. a policewoman puts it in a baggy. we pan across the bed, across the magazines and underwear in plastic bags, down below the bed, where we find the photograph of nadia with the binoculars. the young girl smiles hopefully out at us from the past. early dawn. a woodpigeon coos. john wakes up next to the dead fire. nadia is gone.}
