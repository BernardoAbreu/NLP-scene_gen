<L>__{exterior breakfront day}
<A>__{will dormer, walking along a breakfront. aimless. one foot in front of the other. staring out at nothing. the endless sea. waves crashing. wind howling. seagulls screeching. everything. closing in on him... he stumbles over a rock. grabs his head in his hands. stunned. guilty. ashamed. fucked. he saw it. he saw it! a wave, explodes nearby. drenching him in sea spray. will turns, raking his hand across his face. blinking. eyes stinging. trying to focus. trying to think this through... hears a dog barking in the distance. shakes his head. looks at his watch. got to deal with the problem at hand.}
