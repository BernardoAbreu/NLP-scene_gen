<L>__{interior danny's apartment night}
<A>__{sweltering heat. a fan ruffles carla's hair as she lies on the futon going back and forth between hebrew english torah and a hebrew grammar. danny is on the floor lifting weights.}
<C>__{carla}
<P>__{(slowly, laboriously)}
<D>__{payn tash chiton v'ashiytem...}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(correcting her)}
<D>__{v'asitem...}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{v'asitem lechem pessel to monat. and make no graven image of the lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. because he's not like anything. not only can't you see him or hear him, you can't even think about him. i mean, what's the difference between that and him not existing?}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(still exercising)}
<D>__{no difference.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. or not believe. judaism there's nothing.}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{nothing but nothingness...judaism's not about belief.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{what's it about?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{about doing things. you light candles, say prayers, keep the sabbath, visit the sick....}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{and belief follows?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{no. nothing follows. you don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. you're not saved. nobody's saved. you do it because the torah tells you do. you submit to the torah.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{fuck that.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{don't curse in front of it.}
<C>__{carla}
<P>__{(flips the book closed)}
<D>__{why should i submit?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you shouldn't.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{you think i should just because there's no reason?}
<A>__{he looks at her without answering.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{no, i think you shouldn't.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{judaism doesn't even need god. you have the torah, the law. that's your fucking god....}
<P>__{(anticipating his objections)}
<D>__{the book's closed.}
<A>__{in an access of something, she bites his arm, hard. he winces, pushes her away. she kisses the place she bit. he starts to play with her hair....}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you're learning the hebrew really fast.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{i told you, i'm good at this.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{plus you have nothing else to do all day.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{oh, am i learning it faster than you did? maybe i'm smarter.}
<A>__{he laughs, likes her arrogance. but she misunderstands:}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{is that funny? you think jews are the only smart ones?}
<A>__{as they make out, grow aroused...}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{what...? you think i'm jewish?}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{it's all you talk about. jewish, jewish, jewish. nobody talks about it that much except the jews.}
<A>__{danny's taken aback by the simple logic.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{nazis talk about it all the time.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{do they?}
<A>__{and, of course, she has grown up among nazis.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{the real nazis. hitler, goebbels, they talked about jews incessantly.... you ever read their diaries?...}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{is that why you became a nazi? so you could talk about jews incessantly?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{believe me, adolf hitler couldn't possibly have hated the jews as much as i do. not in a billion years. you know why?}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{'cause he wasn't a rabbi.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you want a punch in the mouth?}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{okay...}
<P>__{(he doesn't hit her)}
<D>__{why don't we light candles on friday? let's light candles.... and say the kaddish.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{kaddish is the prayer for the dead.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{i mean kiddush. let's say kiddush. and shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff...}
<P>__{(as he walks away)}
<D>__{come on, just for fun. to see what it's like...}
