<A>__{leonard and jacob play catch with a football.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{when i was fat. now i don't have to wear a t shirt when i go swimming. who knows, maybe i could even get lucky.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you're still ugly, though.}
<A>__{leonard punches jacob's arm in fun.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{i don't understand what my mother's problem is. it's like the thinner i get, the more she hates me.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{she's probably jealous. maybe you should put her on that diet.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{anytime i mention it, my mother goes crazy.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{if you really want her to drop a few tons, put her in jail. kenny's lost about 30 pounds since he's been incarcerated, and he was already thin.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yeah. jail is the perfect weight loss program. you take a fat tub, throw them in a room and force them to eat right and exercise. don't let them out till they do.}
<A>__{off leonard, thinking }
