<L>__{ext rustler's park day}
<A>__{a wide plateau in the mountains dotted with tents, water and fee troughs, rope corrals, etc. cowboys cut out steers while others crouch around fires, cooking, looking up with naked hostility as wyatt rides up. mcmasters points to the edge of camp where billy clanton is currying wyatt's stallion.}
<C>__{mcmasters}
<D>__{you seem like a nice fella. like to've know you better. had you lived.}
<A>__{wyatt rides on, making for billy. ike steps up with indian hawk swilling, the giant half breed. they walk alongside wyatt.}
<C>__{ike}
<D>__{hey, law dog. the hell you doin' here?}
<C>__{swilling}
<D>__{how 'bout i just drag you off that horse and eat you blood raw?}
<A>__{wyatt ignores them, riding up to within 20 feet of billy and dismounting. billy looks up, supremely confident and unconcerned.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{where'd you get that horse?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{beauty, ain't he?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{i asked where you got him.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{where do you think? i stole him.}
<A>__{everyone laughs. more cowboys gather, jeering. wyatt steps closer.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{look, i don't want any trouble with you but that's my horse and i mean to have him back. one way or another.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{come and get him.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{look kid, i know what it's like, i was a kid, too. even stole a horse once. but you can't }
<C>__{ike}
<D>__{don't sweet talk him, make a move.}
<C>__{swilling}
<D>__{yeah, go ahead, mister. make a move.}
<A>__{billy steps back, poised. ike and swilling do the same. more cowboys move up behind him. the scene seems on the brink of explosion when curly bill suddenly streaks into frame on his buckskin mare, majestic and 10 times life size as he pulls back and skids to a stop in front of wyatt, raising a giant roostertail of dust, making everyone but wyatt recoil.}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{give him his horse, billy.}
<C>__{ike}
<D>__{come on, curly! don't let him }
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{shut up. give him his horse, billy.}
<A>__{billy reluctantly hands over the leadline. wyatt mounts and rides off with dick nailor in tow, curly bill riding alongside.}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{feel bad about ol' fred. just can't hold back when i'm feelin' woolly. still, feel kinda bad. but now we're square. anyway no use for holdin' a grudge. i deserved a rap in the head.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{make you a deal. my brother took over the marshal's office in tombstone. got it in his head he's gonna make the place safe for widows and orphans. you and your boys stay out of his way, i will make sure he stays out of yours.}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{fair enough. you know i got to admit, you got a lot of bark on you comin' up here like this.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{they were all gonna jump me back there. what ever happened to one against one?}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{ain't our way. we go all on one, one on all. fight one of us, you fight us all. that's the cowboy way.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{and how come you call yourselves cowboys? cowhands ride for the brand.}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{oh, we ride for a brand all right.}
<P>__{(gives wyatt the finger)}
<D>__{this brand. how 'bout you?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<P>__{(points thumb at self)}
<D>__{this brand.}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{we're gonna get along just fine.}
