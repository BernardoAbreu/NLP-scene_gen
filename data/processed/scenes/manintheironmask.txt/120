<D>__{to king louis! and to anne, the queen mother!}
<A>__{the guests applaud and reach for wine glasses; servants present phillippe and anne with champagne, and they sip }
<C>__{guests}
<D>__{to king louis, and the queen mother!}
<A>__{everyone drinks; phillippe suddenly remembers to hold his glass in his fingertips and it slips through his nervous fingers, hitting the floor with a crash. dead silence; everyone is looking. then anne drops her glass too and everybody does it, as if to break the glass is part of the celebration. as the music begins again, anne leans to phillippe }
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i retire now. wait two waltzes, then retire to your room; and spend the night in safety. we have much to talk about, and have the rest of our lives to do it.}

<B>__{just outside the ballroom door}
<A>__{anne encounters d'artagnan. he stops, so taken by the sight of her that no one seeing them could miss that he loves her.}

<D>__{anne! you look }
<A>__{remembering himself, he bows deeply.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{my queen...}
