<L>__{interior bmw night}
<A>__{again matt is driving jack home.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(hesitantly)}
<D>__{look matt, there's something i have to say to you. i saw you cheating.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(violently)}
<D>__{what the fuck are you talking about?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that greek guy who won at the end. you paid him out in 25s not 20s.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{i don't cheat, jack. you've got it wrong.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm not going to report it.}
<A>__{matt slams on the brakes. the car comes to an abrupt stop. matt turns to jack, furious.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what are you, a cop?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{if i see you do it again, i will report it.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i don't get you. even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{because if a supervisor knew i'd seen you and i hadn't reported it, i'd lose my job as well. and i can't afford that.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{so it's mr clean. wise up, jack, this whole business is bent. the casino is nothing but legal theft. and that's ok. it's the system. half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. we earn our money.}
<P>__{(softens)}
<D>__{i'm on your side, jack. i don't need an enemy.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're talking about complicity.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i don't know what that means. i'm talking about not rocking the boat.}
<A>__{matt holds out his hand for jack. jack shakes it. matt grins.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{ok, now let's unwind.}
<A>__{he puts the car into gear and drives off.}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{matt was an escape artist. like jack's father.}
