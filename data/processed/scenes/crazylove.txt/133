<L>__{interior living room michael's apartment later}
<A>__{letty, wearing michael's tux jacket, is curled up on the floor in a fetal position. she stares...at the upset flowers, at the ripped up pillows, at a fist sized hole ripped through an unsturdy wall. her gaze stops on a spaghetti o's can, lying empty on the floor. knocks on the door. letty rises slowly, padding to the door like an old woman. the knocks grow urgent. letty opens the door to ruth. letty throws herself into ruth's waiting embrace. immediately, letty cries. after a moment, letty steps back.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i'm sorry, so sorry. i never should have called.}
<A>__{ruth looks into letty's eyes.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{you did the right thing.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i ruined your wedding night.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{i'm glad you called. now, not another word about it.}
<A>__{ruth pulls letty into the apartment and shuts the door behind them. it is only then that she sees the destruction in the living room. horror flashes across her face.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<A>__{tears stream down letty's face. ruth starts to cry.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{did he hurt you?}
<A>__{letty shakes her head "no." her sobbing intensifies. ruth puts her arm around letty, and together, they sit on the floor. ruth holds letty until the crying eases.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{oh, ruthie, what am i going to do?}
<C>__{r}
<C>__{uth}
<D>__{you don't have to make any decisions tonight.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{but what am i going to do?}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{do you want to go see him? i will take you if you want to go.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i can't. i can't see him there.}
<A>__{ruth holds her close again.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i was so sure. i really thought it would work.}
<P>__{(beat)}
