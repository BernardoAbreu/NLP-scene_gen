<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{tears stream down his face. he looks up and sees himself in the mirror. the eyes that look back are eyes of the ages. involuntary sobs. he begins to shake. the tiny booth suddenly like a crypt. tight, with no air. chuck lets out a gasp.}

<D>__{oh god...}
<A>__{someone pulls open the curtain. a man, from the next booth, fat and middle aged stands before chuck in a pair of pants still sporting the price tags. he looks down.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{you okay, kid?}
<A>__{chuck is suddenly in the throws of a full on anxiety attack. he leaps up and pushes past the man.}
