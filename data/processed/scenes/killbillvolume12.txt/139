<L>__{exterior paula schultz's grave night}
<A>__{a shot straight out of an italian horror film. we see the tombstone of "paula schultz," and the mound of dirt over her grave.}
<B>__{when...}
<A>__{the bride's hand breaks the surface...then like one of fulci's zombies, claws, digs, and pulls herself from mother earth's womb. once extracted from her (almost) final resting place, she rolls over on her back, exhausted. she drinks in the night's air as if it were gulps of water. dirt is in, on, and under every crack, crevice, and wrinkle on her body. she looks like a beautiful sculpture, made out of dirt.}
