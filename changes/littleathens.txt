<LOC>__{INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- MORNING}
<ACTION>__{The room is dark and messy. JERRY, a soft, unshaven boy of about eighteen years, sits on the end of his bed in boxers and an old t- shirt. He has not quite woken up yet. Jerry pulls a huge, well-traveled SUITCASE from his closet and tosses it onto the bed. He begins grabbing articles of CLOTHING from the closet and tossing them into the Suitcase.}
<LOC>__{INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER}
<ACTION>__{Jerry is in his kitchen, which is no brighter than his bedroom, and not much cleaner. Jerry takes another bite of his peanut butter and jelly SANDWICH. He chews mechanically, washing it down with a can of SODA. His lazy mind is somewhere else.}
<LOC>__{INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER}
<ACTION>__{Jerry gargles with a generic brand of MOUTHWASH and spits into the sink. He catches a glimpse of himself in the medicine cabinet mirror - he is not very attractive. He grabs his TOOTHBRUSH and RAZOR, and exits the bathroom.}
<LOC>__{INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER}
<ACTION>__{The room has been stripped except for the bed minus its bedsheets, a naked pillow, a beat-up dresser with a small TV on top of it, an old POGO STICK propped against the wall near the GARBAGE CAN at the foot of the bed, and a few posters and scraps of trash. Jerry tosses his Toothbrush and Razor into his Suitcase next to a VIDEO GAME CONSOLE and several VIDEO GAMES, on top of which lies GRAND THEFT AUTO III. He has pitifully few belongings. He shuts the Suitcase.}
<LOC>__{INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER}
<ACTION>__{The living room is also a mess - the place is either a pig sty or a house full of bachelors. Jerry, now in sweatpants and sneakers, but still wearing the same t-shirt that he slept in, carries his Suitcase through the foyer to the front door. He about-faces to look at the interior of his home. He will not miss it. He turns to open the screen door - it's stuck. He fiddles with handle until the screen door opens. He exits, letting the screen door slam shut behind him.}

Heather is dark-haired, about 5'9" and built like a lingerie model. Allison has blond hair, is several inches shorter than Heather, and although not overweight, she has a softer build than Heather. Heather has take-out PANCAKES and SAUSAGES in front of her, and she is putting it away like she is preparing for famine. Allison has a BAGEL and a PEACH, which remain hardly touched - she has a lot on her mind.}

<ACTION>__{The slender white board extends majestically over the glistening blue water. PEDRO, an unshowered, pot-bellied Hispanic, about twenty-three years of age and wearing cut-off jean shorts, is standing at the end of the board, looking down at the water below as if expecting an invitation. COREY, a late teenager covered with tattoos, with twigs for arms and legs, lies against the hard concrete while inserting the pool VACUUM HOSE into one of the many pool skimmer drains. Pedro begins to bounce on the board - up, down, up, down. Pedro launches forth as if the water called out to him and, but for his want of grace, the entry would be poetic. Instead, Pedro's dive is as clumsy as it is painful.}
