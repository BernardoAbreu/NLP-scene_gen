<D>__{who ever heard of such a thing?}
<A>__{close on roger lemke's casket roger lemke looks peaceful in death, although it's hard to miss the marks on his neck left behind by the belt. tim is at the front of a long line of uneasy mourners. tim holds back tears as he gently touches the marks on lemke's neck. tim steps aside to greet the widow gwen lemke in a receiving line. the grief has left her gaunt. she appears medicated.}

<D>__{i'm... gwen, i'm so sorry. roger is was is a personal hero to me. he just... he had it all. if there's...}

<C>__{bill krogstad}
<D>__{said it before, i will say it again: your job, the office in brown valley all safe. what you need to worry about is getting down there and representing us the best you can. that's all you need to worry about.}

<L>__{interior plane day}
<A>__{tim has a window seat. he reads the safety card. he's sweaty, anxious. a vaguely swarthy man (indian? italian? hard to tell.), 40s, sits next to him. a perky flight attendant approaches.}

<C>__{flight attendant }
<D>__{just gotta make sure you're willing and able to assist crew members in the event of an emergency evacuation...}

<D>__{ok. if you need any help, i'm in.}
<A>__{the flight attendant smiles politely, if confusedly.}
<B>__{the plane takes off}

<C>__{tim }
<D>__{as in, "don't you get lippy with me, mister." my grandma used to say that. before she passed. lot of people pronounce it lip. course the high german's probably more like lipp uh.}

<A>__{tim helps david marinakis take his bag off the carousel.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{like i say, dave, it's not life insurance so much as it is dream insurance.}
<C>__{david marinakis}
<D>__{it's a good way of looking at it.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{i think so.}
<A>__{tim hands david his card, who takes it with a genuine smile.}

<C>__{tim }
<D>__{holy crap. awesome.}

<L>__{interior holiday inn holidome day}
<A>__{tim walks in. he strolls atop the velvety green carpet, past a fountain, beneath a golden colored chandelier and makes his way to the front desk blown away. an apple cheeked clerk, whose name tag reads trent, greets him.}

<D>__{checking in with us, sir?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{you tell me. never done the hotel deal before.}

<C>__{trent}
<D>__{yes, we just need an imprint of your card. for the incidentals.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{traveler's check is a fully insured method of, y'know. 100 percent.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{i'm aware of that, sir. we won't charge the card unless you rent a movie or take something from the mini bar...}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{i'm a non drinker.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{it's standard, sir.}
<A>__{tim eyes trent cautiously as he unzips his cummerbund money belt. he removes a credit card and reluctantly hands it over.}

<D>__{not yet, but i can smell it. the chlorine. it's a super top notch place, mil. you'd be blown away. oop, 321. i'm at mi casa. just a... lemme see how this deal works.}
<A>__{he examines the card key. he slides it in. it doesn't work. tries again. doesn't work. each time he fails, it beeps.}
<C>__{tim }
<D>__{key's like a stinkin' credit card.}
<A>__{suddenly, the door opens. and standing before tim is a black man. tim gasps, drops his suitcase, backs away.}

<D>__{what? what happened?}
<C>__{tim}
<P>__{(to the man)}
<D>__{oh jeez. i'm sorry. i'm... please.}

<D>__{check out these digs. huzzah!}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{yeah, you could do a lot worse.}
<P>__{(a serious beat)}
<D>__{look tim, i gotta put the cards on the table here. the reason we got the junior suite upgrade is because the hotel overbooked wedding or some such. point being, they were asking folks to take on a third roommate to consolidate space. now to me, being an independent owner, the savings of adding a third guy sounded like a real positive.}
<C>__{ronald }
<D>__{but if you've got any qualms, i hear you l & c, that's loud & clear.}
<A>__{ronald has undoubtedly been called a nerd more than once. to tim, however, he is the embodiment of cool and hilarity.}

<D>__{no. i'm down. down with that. heck yeah. any idea who we're gonna be chilling with, roommate wise?}
<C>__{ronald}

<A>__{tim is giddy like a kid away at camp for the first time.}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{this isn't woodstock, tim. it's a regional insurance convention. whoever it is, i'm sure he'll be a straight shooter.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior holidome hallway continuous}
<A>__{a pair of massive, scuffed wing tips walk determinedly down the hall. we don't see the man they belong to, but we most definitely hear him as he passes various convention goers.}

<A>__{a booming laugh follows as the feet continue down the hall.}
<L>__{interior junior suite continuous}
<A>__{tim admires ronald's laptop. the screen saver is a photo of a billboard advertising ronald wilkes insurance. a picture of a stoic looking ronald is the centerpiece of the billboard along with the slogan, your insurance professional.}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{so far it's just the one billboard north of st. cloud. course the traffic load would get me more eyeballs in the twin cities corridor, but at the end of the day, it's n t s. not too shabby.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{ha. n t s. that's hilarious. i'd love to own my own agency...}
<A>__{the door bursts open. we boom up from the scuffed wing tips to reveal dean ziegler, 45, whose massive personality just barely hides an undercurrent of sadness and insecurity.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{baroo baroo, let's get this party started you mother rubbers!}
<A>__{ronald deflates upon seeing dean. he clearly knows him.}
<C>__{dean }
<D>__{ronald wilkes! no fucking way! the ronimal! gimme some love uh, my soul broth uh!}
<A>__{dean gives ronald a bear hug, lifts him off the ground.}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{turn down the volume, ziegler. you just got here, for pete's sake.}

<A>__{tim discreetly looks at the checklist krogstad gave him. under avoid, it says dean ziegler.}
<C>__{dean }
<D>__{don't worry, i won't bite. i'm medicated. not really. but i should be. right ronimal? so what's your handle pal?}
<C>__{ronald}

<C>__{dean}
<D>__{amen. he'll be in my prayers. his family, too. tragedy.}
<A>__{all three nod. a moment of solemn silence. then:}
<C>__{dean }
<D>__{well. i don't know about you wingnuts, but the deanzie could use a drinkzie. what say we blow off the welcome hoo ha and hit horizons for happy hour. two for one cocktails, 10 cent wings, and an all you care to eat pussy buffet!}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{that line was unappealing last year, dean. it remains so now.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{i'm planning to watch president helgesson's opening remarks.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{oh, don't get me started on that smug fuck. orin helgesson is a pardon my french a cunt. just a steaming wet dog cunt.}
<A>__{tim stands there slack jawed this man is evil.}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{no one's buying the potty mouth nonsense you're selling, dean. tim, you'll learn to ignore this degenerate before too long. let's go hear what orin has to say.}

<D>__{i'm orin helgesson, your asmi midwest region chapter president. but i'm not going to make you play hail to the chief. not yet anyhow.}
<A>__{polite laughter from the 60 or so mostly male insurance workers congregated in the sunset terrace ballroom, which has neither a terrace nor a window through which to view a sunset.}
<C>__{orin }
<D>__{seriously, we've got a great line up for asmi `09, with our forward looking theme, let's build a bridge to the 22nd century! just so many innovations our newsletter, the asmi teer is now fully digital. so a lot of our breakout sessions will be dealing with this kind of "e commerce" sort of thing.}

<C>__{tim}
<D>__{you're competing?}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{heck yeah. it's the first year i've ever had a real shot. but the guy you really have to worry about is mike pyle. he owns the sixth largest allstate agency in the upper midwest. the guy's a shark.}

<C>__{orin}

<C>__{karaoke dj}
<D>__{tim lip? you in the house?}
<A>__{joan passes tim the shot. he slams it. the room applauds as tim nervously makes his way to the stage. tim confers with the dj. the dj nods, cues up the song. tim gives joan a look of mock anger as he takes the mic.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{i, um, i've met some really, just super neat people here. but this song, i'd like to dedicate to the first african american person i've ever met. i mean, i've seen guys at the oneida mall in rhinelander said hello and that. but... anyway, i just think you're one of the most awesome guys around. ronald wilkes!}
<A>__{tim gives ronald a thumbs up. ronald returns the gesture as the opening bars of clarence carter's patches kick in. [note: patches is an extremely sentimental soul song about a poor black kid named patches.] the first verse is spoken word.}
<C>__{tim }
<P>__{(reading off the screen)}
<D>__{i was born and raised down in alabama. on a farm way back up in the woods. i was so ragged that folks used to call me patches. papa used to tease me about it. but deep down inside he was hurt, 'cause he'd done all he could.}
<A>__{joan and dean whoo hoo!}
<C>__{tim }
<P>__{(breaks into song, very soulful)}
<D>__{my papa was a great old man. i can see him with a shovel in his hands. see education he never had; he did wonders when the times got bad. the little money from the crops he raised barely paid the bills we made.}
<A>__{joan and dean rush to the dance floor. ronald remains on his bar stool but bops his head politely. tim tears it up. patches continues, creating a:}
<T>__{music bed over:}
<A>__{a series of shots tim drinks more sherry. the gang laughs, having a blast. ronald tries to excuse himself.}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{the presentation's in 36 hours. i can't afford to be off my game. frankly, neither can you, tim.}
<A>__{tim responds by giving ronald a noogie. everyone laughs. joan, dean and ronald roam the holidome halls. tim jumps out from behind a corner, whips some ice machine ice at dean. dean takes off running after tim. joan and ronald follow. the song fades out as the four of them approach the pool area. the sign on the pool door says, hours 8 am 11 pm.}
<C>__{ronald }
<D>__{this is ridiculous, you guys. told you, it closed an hour ago.}
<A>__{tim tries the door. it's open. dean and joan go in. tim and ronald stay in the hall.}

<D>__{tim. come on. this isn't you.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{uh oh. who is it then?}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{you know what i mean. we've both worked our tails off. why poop it away on...}
<T>__{inside the pool area:}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{check this out captain nemo!}
<A>__{dean has placed the top of a garbage can on his head. it looks like an old time scuba apparatus. tim laughs.}

<A>__{dean slides down the kiddie slide into the pool, fully clothed. tim busts up. it looks like too much fun.}

<D>__{so we stay in the shallow end.}
<P>__{(starts removing clothes)}
<D>__{and neither did i.}
<A>__{gulp. now in her bra and thong, joan jumps in. dean bobs around with the trash can on his head. tim slowly starts to undress. he carefully places his money belt on a table. he gets down to his t shirt and tightie whities. far enough. he eases himself into the shallow end.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{yow. chilly. ha.}
<A>__{joan back strokes over to tim. he tries to look elsewhere.}

<A>__{she kisses him on the mouth, moves his hands to her breasts.}
<C>__{tim }
<D>__{oh jeez...}
<A>__{tim gives in. they make out. in the deep end, dean takes the garbage can off his head and watches.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{hell yeah.}
<A>__{joan pulls off tim's t shirt, flings it aside. they're really going to town. off screen, we hear a sliding door open. high angle (specifically, four floors up): from this pov, it looks like tim and joan are having sex. dean, meanwhile, has moved closer and may or may not be masturbating as he watches them. reveal whose pov this is: orin has come out onto his balcony. he looks aghast.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{what the heck's going on down there?!}
<A>__{tim looks up, makes fleeting eye contact with orin. shit! tim scrambles to get out of the pool. joan is a half step behind him. dean decides that now would be a good time to moon orin.}

<C>__{joan}
<D>__{your cell phone kept ringing in your little fanny pack thing, so i shut it off. when i saw the discs, i figured i'd take a look. it's a solid presentation.}

<D>__{what? whaddaya...? you and... you and roger, you mean?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{it's so stupid but everyone basically treated us like the brangelina of asmi for a while there. it ended two years ago. he was getting into some pretty weird stuff... as we all know now.}

<C>__{tim}
<D>__{why were you with him then?}

<D>__{pontoon boats don't pay for themselves, tim. roger lemke came to the prom. he showed me a little teat. i rewarded him with the two diamonds three years running. i'm prepared to do the same for you. what do you say? you take home those those two diamonds, northlands' value skyrockets, bill krogstad retires to his time share. everybody wins...}
