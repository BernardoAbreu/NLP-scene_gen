<L>__{interior kettle high the next morning}
<A>__{moments before the first morning bell. needy is sitting at her desk in english class, still visibly bruised from her scuffle with jennifer the night before. she looks like she hasn't slept a wink. the mood is quiet and somber kids whisper about the fire and gather in groups.}
<C>__{gossiping girl}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{i heard needy and jennifer were there and they had to fight their way out with a machete.}
<C>__{other girl}
<D>__{look, she's not even moving.}
<C>__{gossiping girl}
<D>__{it's called post traumatic stress disorder...}
<A>__{suddenly, a figure steps in front of needy. it's jennifer, looking absolutely gorgeous and remarkably unscathed. she smiles brightly at needy as if nothing happened the night before.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{happy friday!, d bag!}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{you you're all right!}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{yeah. why wouldn't i be?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{last night. at my house. you were hurt. you had two black eyes and blood everywhere and...}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{needy, you're delusional. i got a little banged up when you made me go out that window, but i'm fine.}
<C>__{needy}
<P>__{(dumbfounded)}
<D>__{we had to go out that window. the bar was like, engulfed in flames!}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{you do have a tendency to overreact. remember at girl scout camp when you thought there was an earthquake and it was really just two guys with a ghetto blaster?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{a lot of people died, jennifer. they burned to death, or they choked, or they just got trampled. more than half of the people there didn't make it out. it's like, all over the news. national news. kids are dead. parents are dead.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{anyone we know?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{we know everyone!}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{sucks to be them, i guess.}
<A>__{she giggles and reaches for her knockoff designer purse.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{i don't get it. what's wrong with you?}
<A>__{jennifer applies lip gloss and smacks her lips together.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{what's wrong with you? i mean, besides the obvious surface flaws.}
<A>__{needy rubs her eyes, stunned.}
<C>__{needy}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{there's no way i dreamed it. no way.}
<A>__{she looks down at her hands. there's dried blood under her fingernails.}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{her blood was still under my nails. see, i'd been up all night scrubbing the carnage off the linoleum.}
