<D>__{ever burned magnesium? it's so hot it takes water molecules and bamm!}

<D>__{son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace unless you could find something that would eat its residue.}

<D>__{look, it isn't proof, okay? someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in cosgrove's clothes.}
