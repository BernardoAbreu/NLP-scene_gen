<A>__{bob and nan coslaw are sitting up front. marty and jane are in the backseat. jane is as far from marty as she can get. she's still mad as hell. band aids crisscross her knees. marty's wheelchair is collapsed in the cargo area of the wagon. nan turns around to look at the kids and it's really jane she's mad at.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{i want you two to bury the hatchet. you're being very silly, jane.}

<D>__{i think you're being mean as well as silly. your brother has never had a scraped knee in his whole life.}
<A>__{well, here it is the chief source of jane's animus against her brother and the source of most of the tension in the coslaw family. marty winces and turns away a little, embarrassed this always happens. he doesn't like it, but he doesn't know how to make his parents his mother in particular quit it.}
