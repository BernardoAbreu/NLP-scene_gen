<L>__{interior elevator continuous action}
<A>__{sara holds onto her stomach as the creaky elevator descends and the music below rises. the elevator's vibrating with music.}
<C>__{sara}
<P>__{(an inside to chenille)}
<D>__{can't get much more underground than this.}
<L>__{interior feetz club continuous action}
<A>__{a smoky hole in the wall, filled to the brim with kids. mostly black kids with a few whites and latinos melting in. they share a common goal: to clog the dance floor, flaunt their outfits and get nasty with the music of the masters: tupac shakur, nas, lauryn hill, puff daddy, etc. here, the boundaries of dirty dancing are pushed, from erotic to vulgar; loving to lascivious.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{sara and chenille. sara's excited. she loves that she has to shout to be head over the music.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{let's get our table 'fore it gets crashed and i hafta hurt somebody.}
<A>__{sara's bewildered. she doesn't see any tables. she follows chenille to the back of feetz. sees six or seven tables. all of them have reserved signs. most of them are filled.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{what are you, some kind of v.i.p.?}
<A>__{chenille indicates the deejay booth. snookie's in it.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{snook hooks me up whenever he dees.}
<A>__{they walk past a slacker in lycra pants and a big army shirt. he licks his tongue at chenille, grabs at her protruding butt. she swirls around, grabs his crotch hard enough to get his attention. the slacker is squirming in her clutch.}
<C>__{slacker}
<D>__{aw'right, aw'right. you got it.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{got what?}
<C>__{chenille }
<P>__{(as he can't think of}
<D>__{anything but the}
<P>__{squeeze on his balls)}
<D>__{the right to walk past your greasy, tickle dick self without your paws on my ass? 's'that how i got it?}
<A>__{chenille bobs her head right in his face. sara can't believe it. a few people have stopped and are looking. the slacker nods hastily. chenille releases him, gently smoothes out his shirt.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{that's how i thought i had it.}
<P>__{(a fly wave)}
<D>__{see ya.}
<A>__{she and sara continue on to back of the club tables. stop at a reserved one. an adjacent table sports nikki, her three girl crew... and diggy. all nurse drinks. nikki snake eyes sara.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{what is up with this place? seems like they're lettin' anybody in.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{yeah. and they started with you.}
<A>__{the three girls and diggy snicker. nikki gives chenille a look. turns back to sara with a snide smirk. points out her crew.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i'm nikki. alyssa. jasmin. tiff'nee. you know diggy, right, marsha?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{sara. it's sara. and i know you. we have a class together.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{that don't mean you know me.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{quit it, nikki.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{quit what? i ain't walkin' on eggshells just 'cause you brought the brady bunch to the negro club.}
<C>__{sara}
<P>__{(kiss my ass polite)}
<D>__{maybe you came to the wrong spot, nikki. i'm pretty sure this one doesn't have any negroes.}
<A>__{chenille cracks up mainly to back sara up. nikki glowers at her.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i'm pretty sure you came with one.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{oh, no. uh uh, wench. you did not just call me a negro.}
<A>__{as chenille bucks, diggy springs up from her seat, runs her arm in the space between chenille and nikki like a referee.}
<C>__{diggy}
<D>__{alright, y'all. chill.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{tell her to chill. she always got somethin' to say.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{i can say a lot more. keep runnin' your mouth, nikki. i will lay all your shit bare.}
<A>__{whatever shit it is, nikki's not taking any chances. she ejects herself from the table, walks off. the three girls scoot loyally after her. diggy gets up. sits down at sara's and chenille's table. diggy goes with the flow. that's why she always fits in.}
<C>__{diggy}
<D>__{why you burn her like that?}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{'cause i can't stand her ass and the way she played my brother. i need a drink, sara. let's walk.}
