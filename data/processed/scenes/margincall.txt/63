<L>__{exterior city streets morning}
<A>__{there is a haunting blue light bouncing through the buildings. peter is walking through the streets with mid size headphones on his ears. the music is all we hear. he wanders around the almost completely empty city and the further he walks the less his face changes.}
<L>__{exterior city street street cart morning}
<A>__{peter finally stops to get a coffee at a small street cart. he takes off his headphones to pay and the music stops. the wind blows.}
<C>__{coffee guy}
<D>__{one fifty.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{peter turns around and starts walking but as he looks up he see the figure of a woman coming towards him. it is immediately obvious that he knows her. he stops and she keeps slowly walking towards him. they stop in front of each other squarely.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{hey...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{hi. it's really good to see you.}
<A>__{she has a very sweet face but looks tired. she appears to be a bartender or something, she is not dressed for banking.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{you too. you look tired.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i never left work. just had to get out for a walk.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{you're still working there?}
<A>__{this cuts him a bit, why wouldn't he be?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yes, of course...}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{oh. i thought...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{how are you? are you happy? you look happy.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well, i should get back... how's your father?}
<A>__{she is pleasantly surprised by this gesture.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{he's good. thanks for asking.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{ok. be safe.}
<A>__{he starts to leave.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{hey... you got any inside tips for him?}
<A>__{this stops peter dead in his tracks. his world tightens yet clarifies. finally.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{sell.}
<A>__{she looks at him with concern as he doesn't even hint at a smile as he says this. they then give a small kiss on the cheek, and part.}
