<L>__{exterior blue bay school day}
<A>__{sam's jeep rolls out of the drive, jimmy's bike in back, meaning that jimmy and kelly are squeezed into the passenger seat, which is fine with jimmy. kelly's thigh is pressed against his. his arm pushes against her breast. kelly is not so happy. as they near the school's entrance, they come upon a beat to shit vw bug stalled at a stop sign. a john deere tractor mower sits nearby. a groundsman a tall black guy with a shaved head, waits at the wheel of the bug as... suzie toller in black platform shoes, a t shirt and cutoff jeans, leans over the engine, fiddling with the car's linkage. sam pulls up next to the bug and stops.}

<D>__{we got room for one more, suzie. you need a ride?}
<A>__{kelly rolls her eyes as suzie turns to look at them.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{jesus. where'd she get those shoes? whores 4 less?}
<A>__{suzie's eyes go cold. she signals the groundsman, who turns the key. the car splutters to life. suzie flashes a smile, then sticks out her tongue which has been pierced by a silver stud.}
<C>__{kelly }
<D>__{that's cute.}
<A>__{suzie gives her the finger. sam makes eye contact with suzie, offers a sad smile, while putting the jeep in gear.}
<C>__{kelly }
<P>__{(to suzie)}

<A>__{jimmy turns, waving to suzie as the jeep pulls away.}
