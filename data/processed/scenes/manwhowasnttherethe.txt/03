<L>__{exterior bungalow}
<A>__{it is twilight. ed's coupe is parked in the driveway. he is just rounding the back of the car to open the passenger side door. he pulls doris from the car, half asleep, half drunk.}
<L>__{interior bungalow}
<A>__{the door swings open and ed stumbles in supporting doris, who has one arm draped around his neck. he helps her into the bedroom and eases her onto the bed. he sits on the edge of the bed and looks down at her. shadows from branches just outside wave across her face. she is breathing through her open mouth; her face is moist with perspiration.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{i'd met doris blind on a double date with a loudmouthed buddy of mine who was seeing a friend of hers from work. we went to a movie; doris had a flask; we killed it. she could put it away. at the end of the night she said she liked it i didn't talk much. a couple weeks later she suggested }
<A>__{a harsh jangle from the telephone. doris moans but does not wake; ed rises and does to the living room and picks up the phone.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{ed, it's big dave. i gotta talk to you.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{what now?}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{please, ed.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{but it's...}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{please, ed.}
<A>__{ed sighs.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{your place?}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{i'm at nirdlinger's. let yourself in.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{he hangs up. he nudges doris.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{...honey.}
<A>__{she murmurs.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{...honey.}
<A>__{she rolls away and burrows into a pillow. ed opens her purse and pokes through it. nirdlinger's we are looking over ed's shoulder as he hesitantly swings open a door. it reveals big dave's office, quiet and rather dark. a down facing banker's lamp on the desk illuminates big dave's hands on the desktop.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{...dave?}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{come on in.}
<A>__{ed enters, sits. an awkward silence.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{...what's the problem, big dave?}
<A>__{another silence.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...i'm ruined.}
<A>__{his hands writhe on the desktop.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...it ruined me. this money. no annex. i'm all shot to hell.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{so you paid the guy?}
<A>__{big dave stares without speaking. after a long beat:}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...what kind of man are you?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{...huh?}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{what kind of man are you?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{big dave }
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{i'd understand if you'd walked in here. socked me in the nose. whatever. i deserved it.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i, uh...}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{i'm not proud of what i did. but you.}
<A>__{no one talks. big dave sighs.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...yeah, i paid up. as you well know. and then i went and found the pansy.}
<A>__{he looks at ed.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...got nothin' to say, huh? yeah, well, you already know the story. i didn't, i hadda beat it out of the pansy. your money.}
<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...what kind of man are you?}
<A>__{big dave rises.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...well.}
<A>__{he crosses around the desk and adds, sadly:}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...i'm all shot to hell.}
<A>__{ed starts to rise, but big dave is already looming over him. big dave bear hugs him and then spins him into a wall. ed hits the wall and bounces off, back into big dave. big dave wallops him in the stomach. ed doubles over.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...what kind of man are you?}
<A>__{big dave hurls him against the desk, then slams his face against the desktop. ed's hands scrabble at the top of the desk as big dave grabs him by the neck and lifts. he slams him face first into the window between the office and the dark sales floor. ed twists around, the back of his head now pressed against the glass. big dave's hands lock around his throat. big dave sweats and strains. a crack shoots up the pane of glass. ed's hand sweeps up and plunges something into big dave's neck. big dave grunts and turns away, gurgling. his hands go up to his throat. ed watches. he is holding big dave's cigar trimmer. big dave takes a couple of deliberate steps backward, his head twisted away. he falls back, tripped up by a chair, which spins him face down onto the floor. big dave crawls away face down across the floor, on his knees but with his hands still at his throat. his face and knees awkwardly support his weight as if he were pushing something across the floor with his nose. he reaches a corner but still pushes forward, wedging himself in, legs still scraping away as if to push himself through the wall. blood is pooling out from under him. big dave's legs are still working. his gurgling continues. ed watches. big dave's legs start to move furiously. they convulse. his whole body shakes as he goes into shock. ed watches. big dave stops shaking. he remains wedged awkwardly into the corner, face down. he is still. the room is very quiet. ed looks down at his hands. he walks across the room, pushes the door open and walks across the darkened sales floor.}
