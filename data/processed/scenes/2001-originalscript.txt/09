<L>__{exterior cave new rock}
<A>__{moonwatcher comes face to face with the new rock when he leads the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning. he had almost forgotten the terror of the night, because nothing had happened after that initial noise, so he does not even associate this strange thing with danger or with fear. there is nothing in the least alarming about it. it is a cube about fifteen feet on a side, and it is made of some completely transparent material; indeed, it is not easy to see except when the light of the sun glints on its edges. there are no natural objects to which moonwatcher can compare this apparition. though he is wisely cautious of most new things, he does not hesitate to walk up to it. as nothing happens, he puts out his hand, and feels a warm, hard surface. after several minutes of intense thought, he arrives at a brilliant explanation. it is a rock, of course, and it must have grown during the night. there are many plants that do this â€“ white, pulpy things shaped like pebbles, that seem to shoot up in the hours of darkness. it is true that they are small and round, whereas this is large and square; but greater and later philosophers than moonwatcher would be prepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their laws. this really superb piece of abstract thinking leads moonwatcher to a deduction which he immediately puts to the test. the white, round pebble plants are very tasty (though there were a few that made one violently sick); perhaps this square one...? a few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him. there is no nourishment here; so like a sensible hominid, he continues on his way to the river and forgets all about the cube.}
