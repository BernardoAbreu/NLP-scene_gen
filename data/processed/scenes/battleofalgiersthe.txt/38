<L>__{38 casbah road blocks. outside. day.}
<A>__{the casbah is being closed off. every point of entrance, every alley, every street that joins the casbah and the european quarters has been blocked off with wooden horses and with barbed wire nine feet high. there are also workers, policemen, and soldiers who are working at the barricades. beyond them, on the other side of the barbed wire, the algerians seem to be encaged.}

<D>__{"the prefecture of algiers states: in the course of these last few days, dozens of assaults have been committed in this city. we have reason to believe that the assailants originate in the casbah, and that they have always found a speedy and easy refuge in the alleys of the arab quarters. as a result, and in order to alleviate without delay the insecurity that now reigns in the city, the prefecture of algiers has decided that entrance to the casbah can only he permitted at those points in the blockade under military control, where citizens in transit must exhibit their documents at request, and submit to eventual searches."}
<A>__{the casbah is imprisoned, like a huge concentration camp. only five streets have been left open, the widest streets. there are five exits where the wooden horses serve to restrict passage, and where some wooden posts for the guards are being built. every exit is marked by a sign with large lettering.}
