<A>__{norman comes off the porch, walks to the path and directly up to the house, opens the door and goes in.}

<B>__{shooting up the stairs}
<A>__{norman goes up, pauses one moment outside his mother's door, then opens it and goes in, leaving the door open. for a moment we hear only norman's low, quiet voice, his words indistinguishable. then we hear the cold shot of his mother's derisive laughter.}
<C>__{mother's voice}
<D>__{i am sorry, boy, but you do manage to look ludicrous when you give me orders!}
<C>__{norman's voice}
<D>__{please, mother...}
<C>__{mother's voice}
<P>__{(sharp, laughter all gone)}
<D>__{no! i will not hide in the fruit cellar!}
<P>__{(a shrill laugh)}
<D>__{think i'm fruity, huh?}
<P>__{(hard, cold again)}
<D>__{i'm staying right here! this is my room and no one will drag me out of it... least of all my big bold son!}
<C>__{norman's voice}
<P>__{(rising now, anxiously)}
<D>__{they'll come now, mother. he came after the girl and now someone will come after him! how long do you think you can go on... mother, please, just for a few days, just so they won't find you!}
<C>__{mother's voice}
<P>__{(mimicking)}
<D>__{just for a few days...}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{in that dank fruit cellar? no! you hid me there once, boy, and you won't do it again! not ever again! now get out!}
<P>__{(a pause, quiet)}
<D>__{i told you to get out, boy!}
<P>__{(a longer pause)}
<D>__{norman! what do you think you're going to do? don't you touch me! don't! norman!}
<P>__{(a pause, then cajolingly)}
<D>__{all right, son, put me down and i will go. i will go on my own two feet. i can go on my own two feet, can't i?}
<A>__{during all this the camera has been slowly creeping up the stairs. it does not stop at the top however, but continues on the same high angle that we had in scene 57. she starts to laugh, a terrible sound like an obscene melody.}
<C>__{norman's voice}
<D>__{i will carry you, mother.}
<A>__{norman comes out of the room, his mother held in his arms, her head leaning against his shoulder. he carries her down the stairs, along the lower landing to the cellar stairs, and then down those stairs to the basement.}
