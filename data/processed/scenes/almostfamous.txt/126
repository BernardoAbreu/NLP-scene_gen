<A>__{night. doris rocks toward cleveland on a muggy summer night. the windows of passing houses offer rich edward hopper glimpses of lives and people william will never meet.}
<L>__{interior william's bus bunk night}
<A>__{william watches from his bus bunk at the back, head on elbow. looking up, he sees the rhythmic motion of bodies on the mattress above him, as music continues. william gets up, nods hello to the roadie and his date on the bunk above. he moves down the aisle... to the seats near the front. a sleeping russell sits upright, hugging his guitar. penny asleep next to him, polaroid in her hand of... russell sleeping. the kid moves on. he sits with the bus driver, whose cb crackles with chatter from other tour buses headed to cleveland. on the first sign late night cleveland signs. music rises. heads pop awake.}
