<A>__{nigel starling, running as best as he can alongside the train, trying to pull himself up onto the engine seat. starling is a terribly appealing young man. clothes do not fit him well, and he is constantly tugging at this sleeve or that shirttail, trying to get things right. he wears glasses, tends nonetheless to squint at the world. he is, above all, a good man, morally impeccable and very much a product of these victorian times.}
