David crosses the room and pushes aside the curtain. It leads to a small balcony. An empty lawn chair is the only thing on it. David steps onto the balcony and looks down. The rain still pours down unmercifully. It comes down on a black tarp that covers a pool in the backyard. David turns to go back inside.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{A BLURR OF ORANGE ATTACKS HIM.}
<ACTION>__{The collision is sudden and explosive. The huge man drives his shoulder into David's chest and takes him off his feet. David's body flips over the railing. The dark green rain poncho flaps in the wind as he falls two stories directly towards the black tarp.}

Half his face is covered in water. Beat. David's exposed eye looks around in a daze. The surface of  the tarp gets pounded by the rain. David uses his hands to push his body off the tarp. His hands sink into the water as his pressure pushes the tarp down.}

THE SOUND CONTINUES ANYWAY. One by one the tarp starts sliding out from under the sand bags all around the edge of the pool. And then without warning, the tarp caves in. It folds around David as he and the tarp get pulled UNDER THE COLD DARK WATER.}

David's only free hand reaches for the light. It catches the silver pole. The tangled mass of David and the tarp are pulled slowly towards the edge of the pool. David's head and shoulders emerge from the darkness. He takes hold of the pool's edge. Huge desperate breaths as he pulls his body out from the water and the grasp of the tarp. He hauls himself onto the ground. He sits hunched over in a dark mass, his head down under his hood. The rain poncho covering him like a blanket. Beat. He rises to his feet. The water rushes off of him. His breathing is slowing, calming. He stands in a silhouette from the light of the house. He turns and looks to the two small figures standing near the edge of the pool. The children from the bathroom stand still in the rain. They're holding an aluminum pole with a brush head for cleaning the pool. They stare up at the hooded figure. No one says anything.}

He doesn't notice the third presence come into the room. He doesn't hear him move closer. Right behind him. The man in orange takes another sip of his beer, not realizing an arm is reaching over him... He doesn't get to swallow the sip in his mouth. David Dunne's powerful arm wraps around the man's thick neck. David's hands clamp together like and iron vise. He squeezes. The man's beer bottle crashes to the ground as his neck begins to get crushed. David yanks back hard, pulls the man off balance. The man's legs push back violently, sending both of them backwards across the room. They come to a hard stop as David's back gets RAMMED INTO THE BEDROOM WALL. The huge man in orange pulls away and then SLAMS DAVID harder against the wall. David's arm remains locked around his throat. The man becomes frantic. His face turning dark red. He clutches at David's arm. He spins, taking David with him into another wall. The IMPACT IS TREMENDOUS. The room shakes. David holds on. His face bent low and hidden under his hood. And then the man in orange throws a powerful elbow back. It lands hard right in David's side. David groans. The huge man delivers another one. Savage, desperate blows. WE HEAR THE IMPACT OF EACH ONE WITH DAVID'S BODY. And David never lets go. The elbows slow and then stop. The legs of the man in orange start to buckle. David pulls him back onto his heels. He turns him in a half circle. All of his tremendous weight is hanging from David's arm now. David LETS OUT A YELL AS HE APPLIES ALL HIS STRENGTH. The man's legs stop kicking. David keeps turning him. The man's body goes completely limp. David's just dragging two hundred and seventy-five pounds of weight in a circle over the carpet now. David slowly comes to a stop. He stands there with his arm wrapped around the man's neck....The man's limbs dangle down to the ground. Beat. David's hands let go of each other. His arm slips out from under the man's jaw. The man in orange crumples to the ground like a rag doll. The only SOUND IN THE ROOM IS DAVID'S HEAVY BREATHING. Beat. He moves to the woman slumped against the door.
