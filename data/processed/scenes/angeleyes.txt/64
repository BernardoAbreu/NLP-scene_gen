<A>__{sharon is peacefully asleep. he stands over her with troubled eyes, but this slowly changes to a loving look. he bends close to her face. he feels her breath on him. he wants to lie down with her but he raises a hand and very gently brushes her cheek. she stirs. he does it again. she sighs a peaceful sigh, opens her eyes. he smiles at her.}
