<A>__{a door slams back. robin bursts through. alone, against three attackers. he swings a soldier around. holds him as a shield, using the man's own sword against his companions. in seconds, all three are down and robin is off and running. down corridors, searching. soldiers and armed servants converge to block his way. robin strikes, vaults, flings statues. up the stairs... topples a suit of armor down on his pursuers.}

<D>__{ah! there is my answer.}
<A>__{he hurls the man aside... the armed guards charge him.}
