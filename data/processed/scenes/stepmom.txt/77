<A>__{, as... an enormous crane moves through the sky. jackie holds tightly onto jessica, a diminutive five foot tall firewoman, as they soar skyward towards ben. a slightly condescending tone to...}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{that's quite a grip you have there ma'am. do we have an issue with heights?}
<A>__{patronized the wrong gal. in a crisis.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(looking her up and down)}
<D>__{i don't care if you're a dwarf, so long as you do your job. ben! i'm coming! stay there! mommy's coming!}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{ma'am, my arm's going numb, maybe you could loosen your grip just a little.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{that's absolutely out of the question. ben! i'm here!}
<A>__{the crane stops. ben has climbed to the top branches of the trees; they sway from side to side like a metronome.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{hello ben. your mother says you're real good at disappearing }
<A>__{ben tries to climb a little higher branches snap.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{ben! mommy's so glad to see you now stop climbing!}
<P>__{(he keeps climbing)}
<D>__{ben listen to me...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no! i have to get there.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{where ben?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{before you.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{ben where do you have to get to?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{heaven. i have to tell him he's made a mistake. he should take grammy martha first. or grandpa norman.}
<A>__{jackie's heart breaks, unable to speak.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{ben. god doesn't like visitors.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{ask her, she's a heroic fireperson. she does this twenty times a day.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{jessica begins to crawl out to him on the limb.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{oh yeh. it's in our official manual.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{that's right, ben. that's why firemen have giant ladders and climb up and down poles. they're like... messengers... carrier pigeons... between heaven and earth.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{that's good cause we need to hurry. my mom doesn't have very much time left.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{then you know what we should do? we should go to the fire station together and ring the firebell to get god's attention.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{cause it's an emergency.}
<A>__{ben opens his arms, teeters, and jessica has him. she reaches him out, and... ...hands him to jackie, alone in the cherry picker. jackie grasps ben, pulling him fiercely to her arms in a death grip. from down below, the kids cheer. the worst is over. hold on jackie, clutching her baby for dear life. knowing it isn't.}
