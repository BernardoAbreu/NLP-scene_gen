<D>__{you told me to contact you if anything relevant came up gabriela is relevant. when i spoke to you before i didn't know she'd been seeing eduard.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{that's been noted. but where does it lead us? unless you have something more to add.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{she's missing. i went to her house and she hadn't returned there.}
<A>__{the policeman at the dumbwaiter peers down the shaft but then moves on.}

<A>__{the two other policemen look at each other ominously. the inspector turns to them, giving them a look, and they go off down the stairs. the inspector plods back up to kafka like a stern parent. they confront each other, kafka trying not to cringe too baldly. scary shadows around the bizarrely angled stairway.}
