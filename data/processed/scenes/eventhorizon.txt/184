<A>__{the crew, except for cooper. dj whets a scalpel against the leg of his jumpsuit, an unconscious gesture. flick. flick.}
<B>__{flick.}
<C>__{dj}
<D>__{carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{goddammit, dj, it was not a hallucination! i saw a man, he was on fire. and then he disappeared.}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{maybe one of the original crew?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{no. it was someone else.}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(ignoring the question)}
<D>__{dr. weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{no. i saw nothing.}
<C>__{peters}
<D>__{i did.}
<A>__{all heads turn to her.}
<C>__{peters}
<D>__{about an hour ago. in medical. i saw my son. he was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were...}
<P>__{(she trails off)}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?}
<C>__{peters}
<D>__{i've seen bodies before. this is different.}
<A>__{she falls silent, unwilling to say more.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{peters is right. its like something reaching into your mind. seeing your thoughts and making them real. smith, did you or cooper experience anything unusual?}
<A>__{smith, leaning against the doorway:}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{i didn't see anything and i don't have to see anything. this ship is fucked.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{thank you for that scientific analysis, mister smith.}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(exploding)}
<D>__{hey! you don't need to be a scientist figure it out...}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{smith...}
<A>__{weir's face is stone.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? you already killed the first crew...}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{that's enough!}
<A>__{dj lays one hand on smith's shoulder to calm him... smith reacts violently, turning on dj, shoving him back. dj uses smith's momentum to spin the pilot into the wall. he presses his scalpel just below smith's ear...}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{dj!!}
<A>__{dj freezes. the scalpel falls from his hands. he releases smith.}
<C>__{dj}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i... i don't know why i did that.}

<A>__{smith goes for weir.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{he's fucking lying, you know something...!}
<A>__{miller heads him off, grabs him.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{that's it, that's enough for one day, smith! i need you back on the clark, i need you calm, i need you using your head, you make a mistake out there, none of are getting home, you understand?}
<A>__{smith calms.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{sir.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{get outside, go back to work. i will join you shortly.}
<A>__{smith leaves.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{we're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. let's not make it worse. if anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{i think i can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{do it.}
<C>__{dj}
<D>__{to conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. anyone who can should get some sleep.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i don't need sleep, dj. i need answers.}
<A>__{miller exits. starck follows.}
