<L>__{interior town center day}
<A>__{the huge, spacious main chamber of the colony. looming over the scene is the royal palace, which seems to be inaccessible, perched on top of a hill like pedestal. around the base of the pedestal, a crew of workers loiters, seemingly aimlessly...can these be the only unemployed ants in the place?}
<C>__{general formica}
<D>__{stairs!}
<A>__{the workers look up and groan. then they start forming a stairway with their own bodies, linking arms, stepping on each other's shoulders. it's extremely unpleasant work. one ant is a little tardy, and just manages to get in place before... general formica, the pattonesque military leader of the colony, steps on his head, using it as the first step as he ascends to the palace, his aide de camp carpenter in tow. as formica mounts the "stairs" we can hear the workers going, "ouch! oof! yikes!" etc.}
<C>__{general formica}
<D>__{cut the chit chat down there!}
<P>__{(turning to carpenter)}
<D>__{we've spoiled these workers, carpenter. they've never had it so good, and listen to them always grumbling and complaining...}
<A>__{formica steps on the foot of one of the "stairway" ants, who muffles a yelp.}
<C>__{carpenter}
<D>__{...yes, sir.}
<C>__{general formica}
<D>__{what have they got to complain about? three square meals a day...}
<C>__{carpenter}
<D>__{actually, sir, we've cut them down to three roughly rectangular meals a week.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{don't give me statistics, carpenter. i know what i'm talking about. doors!}
<A>__{formica and carpenter have reached the top of the staircase. there, the two guard ants on either side of the massive throne room doors pull them open and one door hinge}
<B>__{squeaks.}
<C>__{formica}
<P>__{(to guard ant, while passing)}
<D>__{oil that, soldier.}
