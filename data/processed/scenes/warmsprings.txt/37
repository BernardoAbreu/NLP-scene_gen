<L>__{exterior boat day}
<A>__{eugene and stanley carry franklin off in the driving rain.}
<L>__{interior diner off the florida coast day}
<A>__{kerosene lamps light the diner which is filled with people, mostly fishermen, seeking refuge from the coming storm. franklin, soaked to the skin and wrapped in a blanket, is being pushed through the door by eugene in a wheelchair. the restaurant collectively pauses to take them. franklin is slowly wheeled across the restaurant. he shrinks from the stares of the patrons. a little girl eating with her parents gets excited when she sees franklin's braces and points. franklin gives her a hard look and she is hurt. what he can't see is that under the table she wears a set of braces like his. franklin is wheeled up to his table and eugene and stanley sit down with him. louis enters resembling a drowned rat. he rips off his hat and raincoat and puts down his suitcase.}

<C>__{louis}
<D>__{good to see you too. nice whiskers. you look like chester arthur.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{stanley, this is mr. howe. he gets sea sick at the mere sight of a boat so he's probably happy that it's being ldestroyed right now.}
<C>__{ouis}
<D>__{boys, i need to talk to mr. roosevelt alone. find your own breakfast. here's a five spot. make it a feast.}
<A>__{they look at the money and take their leave.}

<D>__{you're always so generous with my money.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you mean your mother's, don't you?}
<A>__{the waitress puts down two cups of coffee. franklin pulls out a flask and pours some into his cup. he then lights a cigarette and begins smoking, but doesn't offer one to louis. without asking, louis helps himself.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{so mama financed this fool's errand, has she? well, it's a waste of a trip.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{it was eleanor's idea.}
<A>__{franklin's face is immobile.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{what can i get you?}
<C>__{louis}

<P>__{(to franklin)}
<D>__{what's your fancy, boss?}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{nothing. i fancy nothing.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{he'll have the same.}
<A>__{the waitress grabs their menus and scurries away. louis opens his briefcase and hands franklin a stack of mail. franklin glances it, but doesn't open any.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{there are a few from your children.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{i can still read.}
<A>__{franklin flips through the mail and finds a letter that interests him, opening it.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{your wife wants you to come home.}
<P>__{(choosing his words)}
<D>__{she's concerned. i'm concerned. this life on a boat... where is it getting you?}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{getting me? for one thing, no one gets to see me and i don't get to see them.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{don't say that. everyone's waiting for you to come home. the kids... they're aching to see you.}
<C>__{franklin}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{louis looks sadly at his friend.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{franklin}
<P>__{(skimming the letter)}
<D>__{from george foster peabody. he owns a resort in rural georgia for investment purposes. hot springs or something. he claims that only recently a crippled boy swam in the waters and can walk again.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{oh, for chrissake...}
<C>__{franklin}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"the high magnesium content of these natural springs will hold anyone up. although it is not a resort for infirm types i am extending you my personal invitation to come visit in the off season."}
<P>__{(putting the letter aside)}
<D>__{i'm only welcome in the "off season."}
<A>__{eugene and stanley approach the table.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{mr. roosevelt, we got bad news.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{it's the boat... it got banged up real bad tied to the dock.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{how bad?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{i don't think you can stay there anymore.}
<A>__{franklin absorbs this.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{maybe it's a blessing in disguise, mr. roosevelt. i don't know about you, but i'm homesick.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{and i'm sick of home.}
<P>__{(to louis)}
<D>__{where's the letter from peabody?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you can't be serious?}
<A>__{he hands franklin the letter who rereads it.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{why not miracle waters? i've drunk the oil of monkey glands, been zapped with electricity and hung upside down in harnesses. after all that, this sounds downright peaceful.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i can't quite picture you in the back woods of georgia.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{where do you picture me, louis?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{1600 pennsylvania avenue.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{president, louis? i can't visit the bathroom without a team of associates to help pull my pants down.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{give it a little time.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{there's a reason they say a man runs for office.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i'm going to georgia.}
