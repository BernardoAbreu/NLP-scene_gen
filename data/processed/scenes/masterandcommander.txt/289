<A>__{jack crosses swords with a man in front of him, as an enemy pikeman drives his blade into his left arm, tearing through the sleeve. bonden fires a pistol by his ear, deafening jack and killing the pikeman. to either side, privateers are trying to reach them, shouting, swearing in english, french and spanish. bullets and missiles rain down from above, killing friend and foe alike. killick is in the thick of it, a pistol in either hand, and from his lips a high pitched blood curdling scream. awkward davies is foaming at the mouth as he swings a meat cleaver right and left.}
