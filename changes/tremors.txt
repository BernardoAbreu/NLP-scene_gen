<LOC>__{EXT.  EDGAR'S PLACE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{It's a simple cabin dwarfed by a big, ramshackle barn.  EDGAR DEEMS (60s), a weathered desert rat of a hermit, is walking his donkey around in circles. Now, rattling toward them down an endless dirt road, comes an old, sun-bleached Buick.  It stops and out leans OLD FRED (70s) wearing a sweat-stained fedora.  The two friends nod.}

<ACTION>__{But, suddenly, we hear the donkey restlessly stomping its hooves and braying.  Edgar turns, concerned.  Now we hear an odd sound.  Distant thunder?  The wind?  The donkey gets more and more frantic. The barn shudders violently.  Frightened birds explode from the eaves.  Dust puffs from every old seam.  Roof shingles rain down.  Edgar stares in amazement.}

<DIAL>__{What in the name of Jehovah...?}

<LOC>__{EXT.  CLIFFS - DAWN}
<ACTION>__{The sun lights up spectacular sheer cliffs which plunge 1000 feet from a ruggedly beautiful high-desert plateau.  At the top of the cliffs, silhouetted against the dawn, a lone cow- boy seems to gaze in deep contemplation at the sunrise.  As we MOVE IN, we realize he's actually peeing over the cliff. This is VALENTINE MCKEE (25).  Smart and good looking, Val has nevertheless managed to underachieve brilliantly.  He coasts through life, following the path of least resistance -- which has brought him to this dubious rustic existence on the edge of civilization.  But lately he's beginning to wonder why he hasn't accomplished more in his 25 years. As a few sleepy cows gaze at him, sleepy Val shuffles over to his battered old pickup truck.  A hand-painted sign on the door reads: "V & E -- All Type's of Job's."  Indeed, the pick-up bed is jumbled with tools and supplies for every conceivable odd job -- and the noisily snoring form of his partner huddled in a dirty sleeping bag.  Val raps on the side of the truck.}
<CHAR>__{VAL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(softly)}
<DIAL>__{Good morning, Mr. Bassett, this is your wake-up call.  Please move your fat ass.}
<ACTION>__{No response from the sleeping bag.  Val stares at the cows chewing their cud -- and perks up as he gets an idea.  He gently steps onto the truck's running board, then suddenly starts jumping up and down as hard as he can, rocking the truck violently.}
<CHAR>__{VAL } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{STAMPEDE!  EARL, GET OUT OF THE WAY!}
<ACTION>__{The sleeping bag tries to get up and run for it.  It tumbles out of the back of the pickup.  While Val laughs uproar- iously, EARL BASSET (43) claws his way out of the bag, looks around wildly, and finds himself staring at three motionless cows.}
<CHAR>__{EARL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You dumb shit.}
<ACTION>__{Earl is a good-ol' boy who has lived his life just like Val, drifting from job to job.  He knows why he hasn't accom- plished anything, and often tries to impart his hard-won wisdom to Val, but the last thing the younger man wants is advice. Earl stretches.  The men begin a silent ritual:  Earl gropes through his pockets for a cigarette, but only finds a lighter.  Meanwhile, Val digs in his pockets, coming up with cigarettes, but no lighter.  Typical of these two, each guy always has half of what he needs.  Eventually they sort it out,  trading the necessary implements. Earl reaches for a coffee-pot on a battered Coleman stove on the tailgate.  But it's cold.}

<DIAL>__{Hell you did.  Your turn.}
<ACTION>__{Earl raises his fist.  This is The Challenge, and it instantly triggers the partners' conflict-resolution technique.  They solve all disputes using the children's game of "scissors, rock, paper."  Earl raises his fist in response.  The game is played swiftly and silently -- one, two, three.  On three, Val mimes "paper" (open hand.  Earl mimes "scissors" (two extended fingers).  Scissors cuts paper.  Val has lost.  He shrugs and starts pumping up the stove fuel tank.}

<LOC>__{EXT.  JEEP TRAIL - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Val guides the truck down a tortuous, rocky, almost impas- sable trail.  It takes full concentration as he fights the steering wheel, shifts, rides the brake and leans out trying to pick a decent route.  Earl braces his feet on the dash and munches breakfast, a raw hot dog right out of the package.}

Val's eyes do an expert vertical scan: short brown hair, small brown eyes, so-so chest, legs hidden in baggy dungarees. Laden with a portable computer, notebooks, and some seismograph printouts, she stares at him through tilted glasses.  Her little pick-up truck is loaded with geology field equipment.  She shakes Val's hand firmly.}

She's caught in an old rusted barbed wire fence, lying almost flat, hidden in the weeds.  Some strands have come loose and are curled up like vicious concertina wire. Barely has she taken this in when -- the ground caves in under her!  She rolls wildly to one side as hook-tentacles snake up, missing her by inches!  She keeps rolling-crawling- scrambling -- anything to get away from the awful maw -- but gets her legs hopelessly tangled in the barbed wire.  She freezes.  The creature feels around where she was. She calms herself, pulling gingerly at the wire, working tensely to free herself but -- The creature's mouth slams shut on the fence.  Like a spider sensing something caught in its web, the monster knows it's on to something.  Its hook-tentacles shoot forward to snare three feet of fence, then the creature lunges up and out, swallowing that three feet in a big "gulp" and yanking Rhonda violently toward it!  She screams, pants ripped, legs slashed and bleeding!  GULP!  She's dragged even closer.}

<DIAL>__{Well, yeah!  There's going to be major research up here.  First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up.}
