<C>__{clementine }
<P>__{(poking her head downstairs)}
<D>__{what if you stay this time?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i walked out the door. there's no more memory.}
<C>__{clementine}

<A>__{clementine comes downstairs, vague and robotic, making her way through the decaying environment.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{bye, joel.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i love you.}
