<L>__{interior corridor office night}
<A>__{we move through subterranean corridors and past dozens of projects that share some similarity to the machine we have seen, including crude designs that have been rejected or stripped of their good ideas. faintly we become aware of a clicking sound. almost like a stopwatch very far away, always growing louder. the newscast has faded and another voice is getting closer from somewhere down the hall. sabretooth emerges around a corner heading towards us, turning just as we get to him. the clicking is loud and clear now. sabretooth enters an office and we follow him. seated at a desk in the center of the room is max lensherr age somewhere after sixty, but strong and vital for his years. he is more often called magneto. the clicking is from the sound of an executive pendulum thingy on his desk. the six steel balls hang onto one another from string supports in formation depending on how many are let to fly from either end. one ball strikes one and one ball swings out from the other. two balls and two, and so on. slight difference. there are no strings supporting the balls, thus defying gravity. a chess set all of its pieces made of beautifully crafted iron sits on the far end of the desk. he is watching television, or more accurately listening his eyes looking off into space, deep in thought.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{...and the leading voice in the call for mutant registration is senator scott frank kelly, of florida, who claims to support the constitutional rights of the genetically enhanced, but whose crusade to register mutants is gaining popularity.}
<A>__{now kelly is on the screen. magneto shakes his head.}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{not this one again.}
<A>__{when sabretooth clears his throat, the clicking balls instantly freeze and hover there. the volume on the television drops, though no remote is in sight. magneto notices sabretoothis apparent exhaustion, his torn clothing, including the slashes in his side. his look asks iwhat happened?i sabretooth crosses the room and places the shining dog tag on the table. the one he ripped from logan's neck. he sits at the desk, puzzling over it.}
<C>__{magneto }
<D>__{your expression tells me the news is not good, brother.}
<C>__{sabretooth}
<D>__{i lost him.}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{sabretooth}
<D>__{it was xavier's people. they knew.}
<A>__{frustrated. magneto inspects the dog tag.}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{i want him. that is all they know because that is all you know.}
<A>__{nothing odd about the tag at a glance, military dog tag, weathered and beaten, but certainly plain, canadian military, logan's name, rank, and a faded serial number. his thumb feels the indention of the word at the bottom of the tag that does not seem to fit here.}
<B>__{wolverine}
<A>__{we hear the voice of senator kelly on the tv. kelly is on the screen giving good face. as he turns up the television, and again, we donit see how, he places the dog tag on his desk, thinking.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i think the presidentis pre occupation with international affairs has drawn his attention away from this problem. americanis deserve the right to decide whether they want their children to be in school with mutants. to be taught by mutants. they also have the right to know the dangers. thatis the purpose of registration. and mark my words, if the president isnit strong enough to do what needs to be done...}
<A>__{as the senator continues we pull back and see magneto watching this. he begins speaking over kellyis diatribe.}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{and you may mark my words, senator kelly. all your plotting, all your hatred. i have plans for you. iive seen you come, and i will see you go.}
<A>__{as magneto turns logan's dog tag between his fingers, we canit help but notice faded purple serial numbers}
<B>__{tattooed in his arm.}
<A>__{he then drops the dog tag on the desk, magneto stands and heads for the door, sabretooth follows. the television shuts off and magneto waves a hand as though beckoning someone to follow. or some thing. he stops and looks back at the dog tag on the desk and waves again. a paper clip just next to the dog tag skips off the desk and into magnetois hand. he drops it, annoyed and tries again. a slight rattle, then nothing more, as though the dog tag were held down by an unimaginable weight. he walks over and picks up the dog tag, inspecting it, then trying to bend it. nothing.}
<C>__{magneto }
<D>__{can it be..?}
<A>__{he puts it back on the desk. now magneto concentrates sending a wave of magnetic force that ripples the air around it. the tag trembles, but does not budge. he looks at sabretooth and smiles.}
<C>__{sabretooth}
<D>__{is that what youire looking for?}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{a piece. only a piece.}
<C>__{sabretooth}
<D>__{is it enough?}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{enough for a test.}
<A>__{and as magneto looks up at kelly on the television we: pan over to a bulletin board on the wall beside him. to a periodic table, smaller than the first. but still with that red square and added letter iai.}
