<L>__{interior retinal fetish backstage & dressing room}
<A>__{at backstage, lenny wends his way through the warren of corridors... past dim rooms full of wire junkies and playback freaks, all trapped into squid nirvana: post modern opium dens. sinister and scary. he glimpses faith, going into her dressing room. he hurries... ... but she doesn't even look around when his reflection appears in the cracked mirror above the crummy vanity table. she is drenched with sweat. spent. chugging a beer. this is the first time they have been alone together in real time for months. pain and the memory of joy.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{hi, baby. i've missed you.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{i know. lenny, if tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i'm already hurting.}
<A>__{she doesn't turn. just watches him in the mirror. most of the scene plays this way. it is a cold parody of their love making playbacks.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{you have to go. i mean it.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{yeah, ok, whatever you say. just answer one question. is anything wrong? iris said you might be in trouble.}
<C>__{faith}
<P>__{(startled, turning to him)}
<D>__{you talked to iris? when?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{tonight.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{well i haven't seen her in months. who knows what's going on in her head. you're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i know you faith. you're afraid of something. what's going on?}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{let it alone, lenny. it'll take care of itself.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{it's tran, isn't it? this guy is poison, faith. listen to me. he's got you walled in on all sides. and he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{that's a good one, coming from you.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{why don't you just split? you don't love him, anybody can see that. and to him you're just some kinda possession, like a ferrari, something to show the other guys.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{he has his uses too.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{what? he gonna record you on his label?}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{come on, faith! he's just toying with you. and when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.}
<A>__{lenny is right behind her now. he puts his hands on her shoulders, tenderly.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{look, baby, i've watched you create yourself out of nothing. you're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it. and you will.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{damn right.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{it's you up on that stage, not him. you don't need him.}
<A>__{she shrugs away from his touch. cold again.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{you have to get out of here. if tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy. he's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid. he's such a control freak, he's even paying max to follow me around.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{max pelcher? you're kidding?}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{yeah, for about a month now. lenny, just stay away from tran, okay? and stay away from me. stop trying to rescue me. those days are over. i'm a big girl now. stop trying to save me, okay, because i don't need saving... just... give up on me.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{can't do it.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{you know one of the ways movies still have squid beat? because they always say "the end." you always know when it's over. it's over! now please leave. i have to go on again in a couple of minutes.}
<A>__{she looks at him and, after a moment, he nods and leaves. as the door closes behind him, faith tosses her towel on the table. she looks frightened and alone.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{hell.}
