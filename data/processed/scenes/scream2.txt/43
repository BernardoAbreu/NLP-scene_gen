<L>__{exterior college campus morning}
<A>__{the early sun casts light upon an otherwise dark and joyless morning as the blood stained campus slowly comes to life.}
<L>__{exterior campus security station morning}
<A>__{the local campus security office has been converted into a media event. news trucks, cameras and reporters stand guard outside while inside...}
<L>__{interior campus security station morning}
<A>__{the place is packed. no longer just a campus security office. the place has been converted to the local police station as well as fbi headquarters. uniforms and suits swarm the place. in a back section of the room, sheriff hartley and captain tyler are in a huge discussion with dean fisher. tempers are heated. its been a sleepless night for all.}
<C>__{captain tyler}
<D>__{we don't know if it's random. we haven't been able to connect the victims.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{the first two were stabbed without thought. the sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.}
<C>__{dean fisher}
<D>__{christ! just do something. i will not have a repeat of gainesville. not on my campus. .}
<A>__{dewey listens to this exchange, slowly stepping forward.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{sidney prescott, sir.}
<A>__{they both turn to him.}
<C>__{dewey }
<D>__{she's the connection.}
<C>__{captain tyler}
<D>__{we know that, son.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{the killer was trying to get to her. that sorority girl was a distraction.}
<C>__{captain tyler}
<D>__{we're aware of that.}
<A>__{sheriff hartley steps forward.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{the killer is obviously repeating woodsboro. i can fill you in on what i know.}
<A>__{dewey is not a welcome participant. eyes roll. captain tyler pulls dewey aside.}
<C>__{captain tyler}
<D>__{look, son. i know you've lived through this, but we got it under control. why don't you have some coffee?}
<A>__{just then, gale weathers appears being ushered in by two uniforms. dean fisher greets her with smiles the fbi and local police fawn over her.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{thank you, miss weathers for coming in.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{of course, what can i do?}
<A>__{captain tyler gives dewey a patronizing pat on the back, sending him off.}
<C>__{captain tyler}
<D>__{we were hoping you could help with the killer's profile.}
<A>__{dewey's face couldn't be more burned.}
