<A>__{hazel continues "not to wait" for gus's call. we see her: brushing her teeth. and checking her phone. watching tv. and checking her phone. eating breakfast. and checking her phone. looking out the window on a rainy day. trying not to check her phone. willing herself to not check the goddamn phone. and checking the phone. where is he?! did he forget about her?}
<L>__{int hazel's dining room night}
<A>__{hazel at the dinner table with her parents. she's a little sullen, barely touching her food. hazel's phone buzzes. she tries not to seem too eager to check it, what with her parents watching and all. she subtly looks down at her lap. and sure enough: a text from gus! her eyes bug out. we see: "tell me my copy is missing the last ten pages or something." hazel smiles. goes back to eating. frannie and michael share a quick glance. a second later, there's a follow up texterior "tell me i have not reached the end of this book!" hazel smiles again. and then a third text: "a book can"t end in the middle of a sentence?! what in god's name is this madness! aaaahhhh!" hazel now laughs out loud. michael clears his throat. hazel looks up.}
