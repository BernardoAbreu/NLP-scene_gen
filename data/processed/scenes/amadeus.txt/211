<L>__{interior wings of schikaneder's theatre night 1790's}
<A>__{we see the actress playing papagena, wearing an old tattered cloak and about to tie a little painted cloth representing a hideous old woman over her face. she is looking worriedly down at mozart, who is lying unconscious on the floor. a few people around him are trying to revive him. one has put a wet handkerchief around his temples. another is holding a small bottle of smelling salts. there are voices saying, 'doctor! take him to a dressing room. someone call a carriage. take him home.' etc. papagena is urged to go on stage by a distracted stage manager. suddenly we hear the voice of salieri.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{i will take care of him.}
<A>__{he steps forward.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{i have a carriage. excuse me.}
<A>__{the actors step back respectfully. he stoops and picks up the frail composer in his arms. mozart is quite limp and salieri has to fling his arms around his own neck. all this is watched nervously by schikaneder on stage whilst performing his scene with papagena as an ugly old woman.}
<C>__{ugly old woman}
<D>__{here i am, my angel.}
<C>__{papageno}
