<D>__{where are your darling children?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{they're at a birthday party. sorry they couldn't be here.}
<A>__{john walks around the room, stiff legged, examining the book shelves, the paintings.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{don't worry. if i had a certified lunatic coming around the house, i'd probably get the kids out of the way too.}
<A>__{april and frank exchange a quick glance.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{oh, look at all this food! you didn't have to go to any trouble for us.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{it's just some sandwiches.}
<A>__{april lifts the plate and offers it to john.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{john, would you like a sandwich?}
<A>__{he avoids her look, but he takes four.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{helen's been talking it up about you people for months.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{the nice young wheelers on revolutionary road, the nice young revolutionaries on wheeler road.}
<A>__{polite laughter.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{who'd like some sherry?}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{please, don't bother frank.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i'd like some sherry. and i will drink helen's if she doesn't beat me to it.}
<A>__{april can't suppress a smile.}
<C>__{john }
<P>__{(suddenly serious)}
<D>__{but, hey... listen, though. you got a high ball glass...? put a couple three ice cubes in it, pour it up to the brim. that's the way i like it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i think i can do that.}
<A>__{mr. givings eats his sandwich, watching his son.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{oh, this is the most wonderful egg salad, april. you must tell me how you fix it.}
<A>__{frank hands john his high ball glass.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you a lawyer frank?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no, i'm not.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i could use a lawyer.}
<C>__{mr. givings}
<D>__{john, let's not get started again about the lawyer.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{pop, couldn't you just sit there and eat your wonderful egg salad, and quit horning in?}
<A>__{mr. givings gives his son a level, warning look.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{see, i've got a good many questions to ask and i'm willing to pay for the answers... now, i don't need to be told that a man who goes after his mother with a coffee table is putting himself in a weak position legally; that's obvious.}
<A>__{frank and april exchange a look.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{john, come and have a look out this fabulous picture window.}
<A>__{mrs. givings gets up and goes to the window.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{if he hits her with it and kills her, that's a criminal case.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{oh, look, the sun's coming out!}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{if all he does is break the coffee table and give her a certain amount of aggravation and she decides to go to court over it, that's a civil case.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{maybe we'll see a rainbow! john, come have a look.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{ma, how about doing everybody a favor? how about shutting up!}
<A>__{april's face. she's not smiling now.}
<C>__{mr. givings}
<D>__{steady down, now.}
<A>__{with her back to the room, mrs. givings closes her eyes.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i can look into it. maybe recommend someone.}
<A>__{john stares at frank for any sign of condescension.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so, what do you do, frank?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i work for knox business machines.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you design the machines?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{make `em, sell `em, repair `em?}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{all these questions.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i sort of help sell them, i guess. i work in the office. actually, it's sort of a stupid job. i mean there's nothing you know, interesting about it or anything.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{oh, frank...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{whaddya do it for then?}
<C>__{mr. givings}
<D>__{maybe frank doesn't want to be questioned like this, son.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{okay, okay, okay i know it's none of my business. and besides, i know the answer. you want to play house, you got to have a job. you want to play very nice house, very sweet house, then you got to have a job you don't like. anyone comes along and asks "whaddya do it for?' he's probably on a four hour pass from the state funny farm. all agreed...? ma?}
<A>__{frank laughs. john smiles his yellow grin.}
<C>__{mr. givings}
<D>__{sorry, frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{don't be. i agree with everything you said, john. we both do. that's why i'm quitting the job in the fall and we're taking off.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{we're moving to paris.}
<A>__{john looks over at his mother.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{did you know about this, ma...? wow. how do you feel about that, ma? the nice young wheelers are taking off!}
<A>__{john bursts into a painful braying laugh. it goes on and on. mrs. givings brings a hand to her brow she's on the verge of tears.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{...john, please.}
<C>__{mr. givings}
<D>__{steady down, son.}
<A>__{april looks at frank the whole thing is in danger of going off the rails.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{how about some fresh air, john?}
<A>__{john stops laughing abruptly. he looks to his parents.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{if that's all right with you?}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{i don't know if it's a good idea.}
<C>__{mr. givings}
<D>__{...if john wants to, i don't see the harm.}
