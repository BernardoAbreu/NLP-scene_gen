<L>__{interior casino late afternoon}
<A>__{jenny is nervous about being here. she feels every face that looks at them could be a cop. the star man is pulling her through a maginot line of slot machines toward a 'super jackpot' machine that advertises a $275,000 payoff.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{this is crazy. we don't have time for this.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{i know how to gamble now.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you won ten dollars. big deal. if we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{i want to get money for you and the baby.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i don't need any money for the baby. i will be fine.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{inflation, tuition, college. children are damned expensive. i know.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{the cook again?}
<C>__{star man}
<P>__{(stepping up to the 'super jackpot')}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{if i ever run into that guy, i'm going to kick his ass.}
<A>__{the star man pops a gleaming silver dollar into the machine, pulls the handle and places his hands against the metal. jenny, knowing it can't work, but hoping that it will, stands back and gnaws on her thumb. then she sees the blue haze vibrating out of the star man's palms. jenny stifles a scream. she looks around to see if anybody else has noticed. they haven't. the star man smiles at her. the force field does it's work. a picket line of 7's fills the view window. amid the jangle of bells and flashing lights that accompany a winner jenny doesn't know whether she should jump for joy or hide her face.}
