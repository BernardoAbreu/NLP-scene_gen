<L>__{interior opera stage vienna 1780's}
<A>__{the heroine of the opera (cavalieri) is in full cry addressing the pasha with scorn and defiance. the house is full. watching the performance which is conducted by mozart from the clavier in the midst of the orchestra we note von strack, orsini rosenberg, bonno and von swieten, all grouped around the emperor, in a box. in another box we see an overdressed, middle aged woman and three girls, one of whom is constanze. this is the formidable madame weber and her three daughters, constanze, josefa and sophie. all are enraptured by the spectacle and madame weber is especially enraptured by being there at all. not so, salieri, who sits in another box, coldly watching the stage. cavalieri is singing martern aller arten from the line doch du bist entschlossen.}
<C>__{cavalieri}
<D>__{since you are determined, since you are determined, calmly, with no ferment, welcome every pain and woe. bind me then compel me! bind me then compel me! hurt me. break me! kill me! at last i shall be freed by death!}
<A>__{after a few moments of this showy aria, with the composer and the singer staring at each other he conducting elaborately for her benefit, and she following his beat with rapturous eyes the music fades, and salieri speaks over it.}
<C>__{old salieri }
<D>__{there she was. i had no idea where they met or how yet there she stood on stage for all to see. showing off like the greedy songbird she was. ten minutes of ghastly scales and arpeggios, whizzing up and down like fireworks at a fairground.}
<A>__{music up again for the last 30 bars of the aria.}
<C>__{cavalieri}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{be freed at last by death! be freed at last by death! at last i shall be freed by! death!}
