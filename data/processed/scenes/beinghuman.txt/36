<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{if he eats the grain it means yes.}
<A>__{he scatters some grain on the table. the chicken at once begins to peck them up.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{it's saying yes... there's a way...}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{no, it's saying yes, we should die.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{but you asked it if we had to die, or if there was another way... it's saying yes, there is...}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{no, it's saying yes, we should die.}
<A>__{the bird is certainly enjoying his food.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{maybe it's just hungry...}
<A>__{the chicken is inscrutable, as they are prone to be.}
