<L>__{interior local train day}
<A>__{anna clutches her red bag to her, sitting among passengers. anna looks about her. across the carriage she sees through the window that her train is overtaking another passenger train on the next line. she looks at the windows of the other train "going by" . . . seeing the pas sengers inside. unexpectedly, she seems to see a man who might be vronsky sitting opposite a laughing woman who might be princess sorokina. anna's body jerks involuntarily. she half rises. the image, however, is brief and is borne away, as her own train goes by, accelerating. the win dows opposite pick up speed as she leaves them behind and then she has the same illusion again a "vronsky" and a "sorokina" glimpsed in the other train and snatched away in the instant. now she stands up and goes to the opposite window, where the windows of the other train are flashing by in the (anachronistic) manner of pro jected film frames, and she sees "vronskys" and "sorokinas" flashing by at gathering speed. and then the train has gone and there's nothing going by but the view. anna collapses into the nearest seat.}
