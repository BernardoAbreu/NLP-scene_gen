<A>__{micky appears from a small door at the back of the warehouse. he approaches the ring accompanied with shouts of encouragement and counter shouts. he's wearing a pair of semi cut tracksuit bottoms and a t shirt with grease marks down the front. turkish walks behind him, micky still looks bored. he climbs into the ring. then from the same door as the one through micky came out walks a larger character with a nose that appears to have seen countless rounds with a frying pan: horace 'good night1 anderson.}

<A>__{we drift again into micky's pov, his world is becoming more and more surreal. he can faintly hear turkish whispering words to him, but he's not really listening. a bell comes from somewhere, and micky instinctively walks to the center of the ring. "good night" is already there, they pace one another for a second or two, micky avoids a punch or two and then he takes a hard one and he knows it, we flash to white, micky's in trouble: he lets one of his missiles go and bang it shakes "good night" to his core, all goes quiet. we go to super slow motion: his knees buckle and "good night" is in trouble. micky maintains a frown as he watches his opponent's knees threaten to betray him. the crowd tries to digest what is happening. after a period of silence reality dawns. brick top mouths the words in silence."don1t go down you fucker". the crowd wants micky to finish the job. but common sense reins back the coup de grace.

<D>__{they are on ya. you got to hurt him micky. otherwise we are rumbled.... you hear me micky? do something, it looks like it' s rigged.}
<A>__{micky goes out again his hands are low, bang there is a flash of white as micky goes down in the dirt. dust rises from where he fell. he gets up quickly, his hands are still low, bang he goes down again, in no time he's up. bang: he hits the ground again and this time when he hits the deck, he penetrates the dust covered floor, like i t ' s made out of water. he falls through the water like he's sinking; his eyes are open and he can't breathe, he continues to fall, but he's unpanicked (he is now micky 1). when micky}
