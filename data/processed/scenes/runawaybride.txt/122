<A>__{ike runs after maggie. he grabs her arm and turns her to him.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{i'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{you humiliated me!}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{no, maggie, i defended you. humiliating you is what everyone else is doing. it's the theme of this party.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i had it under control. now they feel sorry for me.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{well, they should. because they're about to watch you hang yourself again. maggie has no response.}
<C>__{ike }
<A>__{ tell me something, do you really care about mount everest?}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{it's fun! it's high.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{or the sexual habits of locusts?}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{that was very interesting research george was doing!}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{what kind of dead head gets a temporary tattoo?}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i already explained about that.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{and where you ever really going to run the leper colony in molokai?}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(wincing)}
<A>__{brian told you that?}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{every one of those times i was being supportive. something you won't understand.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{supportive? you weren't being supportive. you were being scared. just like now. you are the most lost woman i have ever laid eyes on.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{lost!}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{that's right. you're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{what!?}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{with the priest, you liked them scrambled. with the dead head, fried. with the bug guy, poached. now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{that's called changing your mind.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{no, that's called not having a mind of your own. what are you doing, maggie? you really want to let that man drag you up annapuma on your honeymoon? you don't want to climb annapuma.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{yes i do!}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{no you don't. you want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. you want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem. you want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say. am i right? he's laid her flat. maggie can't speak.}
<C>__{ike }
<A>__{am i right? she fights back angry tears.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{stop. stop it! i'm getting married on sunday, and you're just trying to make me run! why? because you're a cynical, exploitative, mean hearted creep who wouldn't know real love if it bit him in the armpit! and all you do is tear other people down and and and laugh at them, and criticize what they do, because you're too afraid to do anything yourself! i read your column. you never wrote one about you. i'm not the only one who's lost and you know it! am i right? well? am i right? angle on: bob comes outside.}
<C>__{bob}
<A>__{mag. help me out here. green bay. right guard. both maggie and ike are breathing hard. bob comes up to maggie and gives ike a very hard look as he puts his arm around his fiancee.}
<C>__{bob }
<A>__{you know... blocked bart starr, crewcut ... are you okay? maggie adjusts her face as best she can.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{yes.}
<C>__{bob}
<A>__{let me take you back inside, okay? she lets him lead her away.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{jerry kramer. ike looks at her drooped shoulder and he shakes his head and walks to his car.}
