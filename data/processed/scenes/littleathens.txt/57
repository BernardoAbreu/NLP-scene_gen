<L>__{exterior landlord's house day}
<A>__{pedro pulls his tow truck and parallel parks on the street in front of the house. pedro gets out of his tow truck and walks up to the front door. he rings the doorbell. there is no answer, so he rings the doorbell again, then knocks on the door. again no answer, so he bangs on the door vigorously. he leans over and peers inside the window. as he does so, mr. carson opens the front door, apparently having just woken up.}

<D>__{pedro? what're you doing here? get the hell off my porch.}

<D>__{hey, mehn, let me into my fucking apartment.}
<C>__{mr. carson}
<D>__{either pay me or get off my porch.}
<A>__{mr. carson shuts the door. pedro turns around and eyes the gray ford taurus parked behind his tow truck. he walks back to his tow truck and grabs some tools. he begins hitching up the ford taurus to his tow truck. mr. carson parts the curtain behind his front window, eyes wide as he watches pedro. the front door opens, and mr. carson comes storming out.}
