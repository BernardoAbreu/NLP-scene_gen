<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(weary)}
<D>__{'...the kids have camp. their friends are here. over there, i will just be shopping in a language i don't even know. my life, and the kids' lives, aren't here to service your mid life crisis.' did it go like that?}
<A>__{it did. people are passing them. they do not notice.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{she called it a fight. the fight.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what do you call it? you told her you had doubts.}
<A>__{he looks around. people are moving on. toward their drinks, their dinners, their lives.}
<C>__{luke}

<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i told her i loved her.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{by way of saying you were unhappy.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{restless.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{excuse me. 'things are so confusing for me, jack. our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict able. it's a partnership, it's juggling schedules. when i think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'}
<A>__{dead at his eyes. and he nods. once.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{'...i don't know if i can make it.' that's what i said. but i didn't leave.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{no, she threw you out. what a difficult woman.}
<A>__{pulls out her box of matches.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{so now i get to wait...}
<A>__{a single match...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{for the first sign. the first fishing trip...}
<A>__{strikes it. shields it from the wind.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what do you figure, luke? when am i too old to be exciting? when your daughter brings home her college roommate?}
<A>__{lights her cigarette. as he watches.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{that's a pretty ugly thing you just said.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{no, here's ugly. 'i love you , babe. it's just our life together i'm not so sure about...'}
<A>__{big draw. never wavering from his eyes.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{'but keep dancing, and if you're lucky, i might just never leave, who knows?'}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{that's not us.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{because you've changed so much.}
<A>__{he puts his hands on her, gently. but she flinches. so the hands come away.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you want me to show you the future. well, i can't darlin'.}
<A>__{i can't. she searches the lovelight in his eyes. as if she could weigh it.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{we make our lives, one step at a time. we do the best we can. the truth about the future? a promise. is only a hope.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{how about the promises we make to our kids? about their future. do we shrug those off, just that easily?}
<A>__{that slows him down.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{maybe annabelle deserves to find out who really broke up her family. while her mom is still around.}
<A>__{stops him. cold.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{hey. just a thought.}
<A>__{flips her cigarette to the gutter. shrugs...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you got one less for dinner.}
<A>__{takes a step back. only one. but it registers.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{where you goin'?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i'm gonna get me a drink.}
<A>__{nods, to herself.}
<C>__{rachel}
