<A>__{hesher wheels grandma's coffin across the parking lot with tj and dad beside him. they seem solemn and strangely dignified in a dishevelled way. hesher leads them out of the parking lot and into the street. traffic passes around them. some cars come to a complete stop. hesher gets the coffin up onto the sidewalk on the other side of the street and the three continue their silent walk with grandma. in slow motion the three walk. dad puts his arm around tj's shoulders, tj puts his arm around dad's. and then a cop car cruises beside them slow. the cops inside watch them. dad looks over. one of the cops smiles.}
