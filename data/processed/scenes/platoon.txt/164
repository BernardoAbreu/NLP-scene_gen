<A>__{rhah, alive and well, is poking around the nva corpses with a long gnarled walking stick, looking like a crazy johnny appleseed with his pants rolled up on his thin hairy ankles and wearing a red bandana tied in a four knot around his head. as one of the apc soldiers carves an ear off a dead nva, rhah works his way through the torn bloody pocket of an nva troop in full rigor mortis, extracting what he thought was there a wrapped cellophane of heroin. rhah's face glows with satisfaction as he tastes it, then snorts it. with a certain satisfaction of triumph over the grim circumstances.}
