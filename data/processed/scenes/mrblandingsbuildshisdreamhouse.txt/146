<P>__{(miserable)}
<D>__{i don't know, dear... i don't know.}
<A>__{bill enters.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{in case anyone's interested, i'm leaving for town.}
<P>__{(for jim's benefit)}

<C>__{bill}
<D>__{mind if i say something?}
<A>__{jim and muriel look at him curiously.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you know, i've kind of been the voice of doom about this whole project. every step of the way i was firmly convinced you were getting fleeced, bilked, rooked, flimflammed and generally taken to the cleaners. and maybe you were. maybe it cost you a whole lot more than you thought it would. maybe there were times when you wished you'd never started the whole thing. but when i look around and see what you two have here i don't know.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{maybe there are some things you should buy with your heart and not with your head. maybe those are the things that really count... see you around.}
<A>__{as bill turns and leaves, the outer door is heard opening and the kids appear. there is an exchange of "hi's" as they pass.}

<D>__{'morning, everybody!}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{hi, dad! how come you're not at the office?}

<C>__{jim}
<D>__{well, not exactly, i }
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{we'll discuss it later.}

<C>__{gussie}
<P>__{(brightly)}
<D>__{come and get it! breakfast everybody.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{good! i'm starving! what are we having, gussie?}
<C>__{gussie}
<D>__{orange juice, scrambled eggs and you know what.}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(making a face)}

<A>__{gussie's head disappears. close shot jim. close shot jim.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what did she say?}
<A>__{he reacts with the sudden exhilaration of balboa first seeing the pacific. he snaps his fingers.}
<C>__{jim}

<A>__{his eyes light up as he begins to visualize.}
