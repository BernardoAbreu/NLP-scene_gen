<A>__{sergeant dally pretends to be concerned.}
<C>__{dally}
<D>__{what would you like us to do?}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{put out a p.b.s.... or whatever it's called.}
<C>__{dally}
<D>__{a.p.b.... he isn't breaking any law. he's a grown man... he can crawl on his hands and knees to china if that's what he wants to do.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{sergeant, i'm a psychologist and i know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... my uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.}
<C>__{dally}
<D>__{we're very sorry about that. some of our men were on the scene of the accident.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{i think my uncle is suffering from a condition called mania which is linked with depression. it is a time when an individual will act over confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. sometimes these plans can be dangerous.}
<C>__{dally}
<D>__{how long does this... mania last?}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{a couple days to a few months if untreated.}
<A>__{dally digests this information.}
<C>__{dally}
<D>__{look, i will see if anyone has spotted him recently. if i get any information, i will call you.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{dally}
<D>__{don't wait by the phone. if he's really been walking this whole time, he's out of our jurisdiction...}
<A>__{adelle looks very emotional... on the verge of tears.}
<C>__{dally}
<D>__{don't worry he'll be back. he's in his forties. he's had no physical training... he'll be back by the end of the week.}
