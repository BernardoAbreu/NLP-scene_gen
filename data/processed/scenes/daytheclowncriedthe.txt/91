<L>__{ext, railroad siding long shot day}
<A>__{as the truck and staff car leave the highway and jolt down a short roadway to a railroad siding where a boxcar sits on the tracks. uniformed guards stand watch on both sides of the car, which has the door nearest the camera, partially open. the truck and staff car pull up to the nearest boxcar. the soldiers jump from the rear of the truck, one of them carrying a large burlap sack.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{as scharff gets out of the car, from the boxcar comes the sound of children crying.}
<C>__{scharff}
<P>__{(to helmut in car)}
<D>__{wait here.}
<A>__{scharff strides purposefully over to sergeant hoffman, the guard beside the open door. hoffman salutes scharff.}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{any word about the train yet?}
<C>__{hoffman}
<D>__{no, sir. the last we heard it won't get here until evening.}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{anyone been around?}
<C>__{hoffman}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{with all that wailing, it's a wonder. couldn't you keep them quiet?}
<C>__{hoffman}
<D>__{i didn't know what to do, lieutenant. i was afraid to close both doors.}
<C>__{scharff}
<P>__{(to other soldiers)}
<D>__{keep a tight guard on the whole area. no one gets near here. understand?}
<P>__{(to hoffman)}
<D>__{you post them.}
<C>__{hoffman}
<P>__{(saluting)}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{hoffman moves over to soldiers and begins giving them their orders.}
<C>__{scharff}
<P>__{(to soldier holding the sack)}
<D>__{leave that here.}
<A>__{the soldier puts down the sack, and hurries off after the others with hoffman leading the way. scharff turns toward the staff car.}
<C>__{scharff}
<P>__{(calling to helmut)}
<D>__{over here, clown.}
<A>__{helmut quickly gets out of the car and moves over to scharff. he looks toward the partially open door.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{they're crying.}
<C>__{scharff}
<P>__{(indicating the sack)}
<D>__{take that in to them.}
<A>__{helmut picks up the sack and peers into it.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{bread. they won't wait so loud with their mouths full.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{how... how long have they been here?}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{you just get in there and keep them quiet. you can do that, can't you?}
<A>__{helmut nods. scharff puts his hand on helmut's shoulder. helmut stiffens under his touch.}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{do a good job and i will personally ask that you get a favorable decision on your case. understand?}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{helmut moves over to the half open door of the boxcar, the camera moving with him. just before he looks inside, he puts a wide grin on his face. but when he does peer into the car, his eyes cease to smile.}
