<A>__{as morty holds a small gift wrapped box in his hands we hear a tinny version of the song dreidel, dreidel, dreidel. he tears open the wrapping paper to reveal a dreidel. he looks at his gift, and then looks off screen. we pan with his look to reveal... a group of christian children congregating around a large, garishly decorated christmas tree. a very vegas merry christmas sign flashes as a larger than life hi fi version of the christmas song jingle bells blares. the children festively slap high fives as they open their presents. we cut to a slow motion cu of gentile boy 1 enamored with his brand new atc motorbike. we cut to a slow motion cu of gentile girl 1. she wears an "i love jesus" t shirt and holds an adorable dog with a bow affixed to its head in her arms. it licks her on the face. we cut back to mordechai. he looks down at his pathetic excuse for a present. he's on the verge of tears. gentile boy 1 calls to mordechai as he drives his atc.}

<A>__{in unison, the class attempts to repeat the words, but all suffer various degrees of pronunciation problems.}
<C>__{mrs. highsmith }
<D>__{very good class. i hope you've all learned an important lesson today. just because mordechai's people are different from us...just because they might appear strange to us with their furry hats, their beady eyes, and their long sideburns...not to mention their bizarre customs and unnecessarily guttural, funny sounding names...just because they control all of the worlds' money, yet are too cheap to buy their children anything better than spinning tops for presents, does not mean that we can't learn to respect and love them as our equals.}

<C>__{mrs. carver }
<D>__{now, if you had saved passover or yom kipur, then maybe you'd have what to brag about. did i tell you that my friend maureen's son, the investment banker, was responsible for a very big merger on...}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{...no, no, no, no, no. i see what you're doing here. so all of a sudden hanukkah's not good enough for you, is that right?}
<A>__{we get a shot of mrs. carver. she's a master of the art of pleasant non listening.}
<C>__{hammer }
<D>__{well i have news for you mom. it is good enough...i'm good enough and i won't leave here until i hear you tell me...}
<C>__{mrs. carver}
<D>__{mazel tov!}
<A>__{mrs. carver picks up the paralyzed tabby and begins eskimo kissing it.}
<C>__{mrs. carver }
<D>__{hello mazel tov! a boojee boojee boojee boo...}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{...i'm not finished yet, mom.}
<A>__{mun chi, completely uninvolved in the conversation and obviously famished, scoops serving after serving onto his plate. mrs. carver ignores her son as she continues to play with the cat.}
<C>__{mrs. carver}
<D>__{...a boojee boojee boojee boo. what's that mazel tov? your tuchus needs some more airing out?}
<A>__{mrs. carver removes the diaper. esther and hammer gag from the smell of it. mun chi, a forkful of food inches from his mouth, gets a whiff and then places the utensil down in angry frustration.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{mom! we're eating!}
<C>__{mrs. carver}
<D>__{what a good poop you made in your diaper mazel tov! that's right! mommy loves you! such a good boy you are!}
<A>__{this gets the hammer going.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{oh, i get it. to you, the cat pooping in his diaper is somehow better than my saving a jewish holiday.}
<P>__{(giving up)}
<D>__{forget it.}
<C>__{mrs. carver}
<D>__{so, what are you two planning after the wedding?}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in boca for a week. and then, when we get back, morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the jdl.}
<C>__{mrs. carver}
<D>__{well, i couldn't be happier for the both of you.}

<D>__{i think i hear the new santa claus busy at work. c'mon.}
<A>__{the hammer motions for everyone to get up and follow him to the window. we cut to the outside of the window looking in on the four as they try and get a better look outside.}
<C>__{mrs. carver}
<D>__{i forgot to ask you, who'd they put in charge as the new santa claus?}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{since santa will be living out the rest of his days at a home for the religionally insane and because he had no blood heirs, the kwanzaa liberation front and the jewish defense league agreed to make the whole santa claus process a democratic vote. we're all very pleased with the first santa elect.}
<A>__{the hammer spots something up in the sky, and points it out to the rest of them.}
<C>__{hammer }
<D>__{look, there he is now.}
<A>__{the full moon shines brightly in the bg of the night sky as we slowly pan past rudolph and the rest of the reindeer, eventually reaching the cockpit. jamal holds the reigns and waves down at mordechai and company. from the window, mordechai, esther, mrs. carver, and mun chi wave back. the hammer jewxploitation theme music begins to fade up.}
<C>__{hammer }
<D>__{merry christmas jamal.}
