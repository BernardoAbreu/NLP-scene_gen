<L>__{exterior farmyard day}
<A>__{overnight, the remnants of a company of soldiers, fresh from battle, have collected in the courtyard. some are tired, dispirited, others are wounded. our travellers watch from the farm window. a few mounted knights come into the yard, herding in front of them a small group of prisoners, well dressed knights and squires.}
<L>__{interior farmhouse day}
<A>__{the travellers look out on the exciting scene, and talk as they eat their breakfast of bread and milk.}
<C>__{pedlar}
<D>__{hostages, too, they've got... they only take the rich ones...}
<A>__{he turns to the forlorn girl.}
<C>__{pedlar}
<D>__{have you ever seen so many fine, rich men, my girl?}
<A>__{hector talks to the company, but means his words for the priest.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i won't be travelling today.}
<A>__{the priest looks him straight in the eye.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{the fighting's behind us, brother ... you'll be safe enough.}
<A>__{hector shakes his head, catching beatrice's eye.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i will stay.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{you should go.}
<A>__{the nun puts an arm around the girl.}
<C>__{nun}
<D>__{we're going. god will protect his ewe lambs.}
<A>__{suddenly the door is thrown open and four soldiers man handle an inert body, dressed in full armor, into the room. they scatter the food from the table and lay out the moaning suit of armor on it. a young squire follows them in and kneels by the knight in the suit. the moans are muffled because the knight's helmet has been battered out of shape in the battle and can't be removed. the ugly dent suggests an equally ugly wound inflicted on the head inside. the soldiers gingerly try to remove the helmet. their efforts are useless. blood oozes from the joints of the helmet. the moaning suit of armor seems inhuman, robot like.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{must be sore in there. is it your dada?}
<A>__{the squire looks at him and nods his head. hector looks with sympathy at the boy.}
<D>__{soldier #2 if he's got a little head it might be alright. has your dada got a big head?}
<A>__{an officer comes into the room.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{is there a blacksmith here? where's the smith?}
<C>__{farm woman}
<D>__{in the village, sir, half a day away.}
<A>__{the officer looks at the moaning suit of armor, then at the astonished group of travellers. he picks on the priest.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{you, priest, come here... get to work on him... he's not ready for heaven yet... there's a hundred thousand livres on his head if i get him to paris alive... start praying... there's fifteen livres in it for you if he lives...}
<A>__{the priest obediently goes up to the knight and starts to pray earnestly. the officer turns to the soldiers.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{get that helmet off... get hammers, anything you can find... and one of you get back down into the valley and fetch an armorer.}
<A>__{the soldiers scatter to carry out their orders. hector takes time to watch the squire still kneeling beside his father, quietly stroking the helmet. ronald the priest mutters every prayer he can remember. the suit of armor twitches and moans. hector looks at beatrice and motions for her to follow him outside. the priest looks on helplessly as they slide past the table and head for the door.}
