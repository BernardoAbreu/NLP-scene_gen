<D>__{i know we banned this play, but frankly i can't remember why. can you refresh my memory, herr director? orsini rosenberg for the same reason, herr chamberlain, that it was banned in france.}
<C>__{von strack}
<D>__{oh yes, yes. and that was? orsini rosenberg well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. he outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. do you see the implications? this would be, in a grander situation, as if a chamberlain were to expose an emperor.}
<C>__{von strack}
<D>__{ah.}
