<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{the glow}
<A>__{appearing again, peeking around the corner. it comes forward, trying to get a look at flynn. the bit.}
<B>__{wide shot}
<A>__{flynn whirls around, fingers poised like a gunfighter. the bit gives a violent start and leaps back, out of the way, but immediately comes back, peering at flynn. flynn is moving closer.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{okay hold it right there!}
<A>__{the bit is still in its pure energy form, but then it suddenly recognizes flynn (thinks he is clu), expands in a smooth green sphere the "yes" mode and shouts:}
<C>__{bit}
<D>__{yes!}
<A>__{the bit subsides into energy form again.}
<C>__{flynn}
<P>__{(still suspicious)}
<D>__{what do you mean, "'yes"?}
<C>__{bit}
<D>__{yesssss. yes. yes. yes.}
<A>__{from now on, whenever the bit speaks, it is a ball shaped character, red or green, with a hint of a face, but as soon as it stops speaking, it reverts to a brilliant spark of light.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{that all you can say?}
<C>__{bit}
<P>__{(of course not, you know better)}
<D>__{no, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{oh. anything else?}
<C>__{bit}
<D>__{oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{only yes and no...}
<P>__{(it dawns)}
<D>__{you're a bit.}
<C>__{bit}
<P>__{(hippie)}
<D>__{for sure...}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{where's your program? won't it miss you?}
<C>__{bit}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{no...}
<A>__{flynn eyes the bit cautiously.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{i'm your program?}
<C>__{bit}
<P>__{(emphatic)}
<D>__{right on the money!}
<C>__{flynn}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{another mouth to feed... you don't by any chance know how to drive this crate?}
<A>__{in answer, the bit moves toward the center of the cabin where a platform supports a four foot tube with a crossbar. flynn follows, stares at the setup for a moment, then steps onto the platform and grabs the cross bar.}
<C>__{flynn }
<D>__{like so?}
<A>__{before the bit can answer, flynn's power flows into the recognizer, and it takes off like a bat out of hell}
