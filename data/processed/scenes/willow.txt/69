<L>__{exterior snow camp night later}
<A>__{fires have burned down. most of the camp is sleeping. it is nearing dawn. madmartigan stares out at sorsha's tent, deep in thought. willow holds up the completed philosopher's stone, a red ball of pliable putty.}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{again: what is the magician's weapon?}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{his will.}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{now use it.}
<A>__{willow presses the philopher's stone against the chainlock. he sheepishly looks over his hsoulder at raziel.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i just wanted to test it first.}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{no! change me back into a sor ceress, willow.}
<A>__{willow goes to raziel and concentrates with physical and mental intensity.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{avaggdu, supriom, luwatha...}
<A>__{it starts to work. raziel curls into a ball of fur. the fur changes to feathers. she begins to squawk strangely. she emerges as a raven sized bird.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{what did i do?}
<A>__{he sags with exhaustion and massages his blistered hands. then: clink! the lock falls open. they all look over, and madmartigan picks it up off the ground.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{not bad, peck. i'm impressed. you busted the lock.}
<A>__{wilow clutches madmartigan's arm. he holds up the stone.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{madmartigan. let's go. let's get eloran danan.}
<A>__{with coldness in his eyes, madmartigan stares across the camp at sorsha's tent.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{let's get elora danan.}
<A>__{they sneak away.}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{wait! what about me!}
<A>__{raziel flaps her wings and flies up into the dark sky.}
