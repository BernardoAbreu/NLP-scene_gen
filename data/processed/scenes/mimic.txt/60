<A>__{ernest walks deeper into the tunnels. dusklight slants in weakly from grates above. he stops as a rumble is heard ahead of him he ducks into a recess in the wall. the rumble grows louder, louder. a subway train curves around the bend up ahead, its headlights raking the opposite wall to reveal... a figure crouched over something. we hear chomping and swallowing sounds.}

<A>__{the overcoat man lets the animal fall to the ground. he begins walking toward ernest. ernest backs away. the overcoat man leaps on him just as the subway train roars past! crack! ernest's body is twisted and crunched by powerful arms. through the strobing windows we see ernest enveloped by the dark figure, then raised above, taken away.}
