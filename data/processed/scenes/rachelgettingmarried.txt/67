<A>__{rachel has run a bath for her sister. she has removed her sari but not her earrings. kym is in the bath. her body is bruised and purple. rachel dabs gently at kym's face with a washcloth while kym scrubs at her nails with a brush. she glides the soapy washcloth over kym's back. she notices the word ethan inscribed within the design of the rose and thorns image tattooed on kym's left shoulder. rachel rinses shampoo and leaves and dirt out of her sister's hair while kym brushes her teeth. rachel dabs makeup on kym's chin as kym's hands tremble with the mascara.}
