<A>__{the shock of defribulator paddles brings kimberly back to life. kimberly's pov looking up at dr. kalarjian, all she can see is part of a woman's face and a partial nametage reading "kalarjian". it would appear as if she's choking kimberly, but an eeg monitor turns from a flatline to a steady heartbeat, the same pov as the premonition.}

<D>__{i know. i can feel it too.}
