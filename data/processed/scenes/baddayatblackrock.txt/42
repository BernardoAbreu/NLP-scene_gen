<L>__{exterior lube pit liz}
<A>__{she does not answer. instead, she silently twists the crankcase petcock, stopping the flow of oil. she watches macreedy closely.}
<L>__{interior garage}
<A>__{macreedy again shifts his eyes to the jeep, then, with decision, he goes to a work bench, opening the drawers and rummaging among the contents.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{if you're looking for the jeep key...}
<A>__{macreedy turns as liz comes toward him. she gestures toward the open drawers.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{...it's not there...}
<A>__{macreedy waits for her to go on. she doesn't. she stands there, staring at him.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{in that case, where do you suggest i look?}
<A>__{she turns, walks back toward the lube pit.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(over her shoulders)}
<D>__{the jeep's not for rent.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{it was, just a few hours ago.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{things change.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(with grim amusement)}
<D>__{sure. and smith is the kid who changes 'em.}
<A>__{she doesn't answer. macreedy goes to her.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{miss brooks.}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{what's the matter with this town of yours?}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{nothing. it's none of your concern.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{then why are they all so concerned about me?}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{am i concerned?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{no, you're not. but...}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{but what?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(easily)}
<D>__{but it strikes me you're a little too unconcerned. so unconcerned you won't even rent me a jeep.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(flaring)}
<D>__{i don't run a taxi service. i don't have a license.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{i wish others in this town were as scrupulously devoted to law and order as you are.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(hotly)}
<D>__{why don't you lay off! if you don't like it here, go back where you came from!}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{funny thing. they try to kill me, and you feel persecuted.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{i don't want to get involved.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{involved in what?}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(retreating)}
<D>__{whatever you're up to. whatever happens, i've got to go on living here. these people are my neighbors, my friends.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{all of them?}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{this is my town, mr. macreedy, like it or not. whatever happened here, it was long ago, now it's... it's...}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(evenly)}
<D>__{dead and buried?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{whatever did happen, you don't seem to like it. why do you stick around?}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{because of my brother. pete. he'd never leave.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{didn't you ever think of going without him. you're sort of independent and he's... he's...}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{weak. i know. that's why i couldn't leave him.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{what did your brother do?}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{he... i...}
<P>__{(flaring again)}
<D>__{what do you care? what do you care about black rock?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{nothing much. only, there're not many places like this in america but even one is too many. because i think something sort of bad happened here.}
<P>__{(frowning)}
<D>__{something i can't find the handle to...}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{you just think so. you don't know.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{this much i know the rule of law has been suspended in this town. the gorillas have taken over.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{you're a fine one to talk! you come in here, sneaking around, trying to steal the key to my jeep.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{i kind of had a notion that was the only way i could get it.}
<A>__{she opens her mouth to answer, but she doesn't know what to say.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{was i wrong, miss brooks?}
<A>__{he waits as she tries to answer, and again she can't. for a moment he watches her struggle in anguished silence with herself. then he turns and goes out.}
