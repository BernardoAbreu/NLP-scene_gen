<A>__{grandfather enters the barn, strokes topthorn's nose as he passes. he sweeps aside a rug from the barn floor, to reveal a trap door. then, he opens it. now from out of the trap door, he lifts a big ungainly object, covered in another rug.}

<D>__{anything you say, my sweet one. anything you say! you are, of course, the boss. it's just an old thing i found don't worry yourself leave it, i will put it back.}
<A>__{he leaves the room. now emilie is alone and she can't help it when she brings her eyes back to the object covered by the rug. she looks back over her shoulder to make sure she's not being watched and then lifts one corner of the rug. her face explodes with a gorgeous smile. she pulls off the rug that is covering the big thing and...it is a gorgeous old saddle. she runs her hand along the saddle can hardly believe it.}
