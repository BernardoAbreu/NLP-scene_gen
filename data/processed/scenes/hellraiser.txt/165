<L>__{interior hospital room night}
<A>__{she flings herself through the door with the engineer's breath on her back, and turns the doorway has gone. the wall is sealed. she approaches the wall. the engineer scratches on the other side ... then, she realises that the bell is still ringing. and there's a foul smell in the air. she looks around. she's not alone. standing across the room from her, lit by a strange phosphorescence that has no visible source, are four extraordinary figures. they are cenobites. each of them is horribly mutilated by systems of hooks and pins. the garments they wear are elaborately constructed to marry with their flesh, laced through skin in places, hooked into bone. the leader of this quartet has pins driven into his head at inch intervals. at his side, a woman whose neck is pinned open like a vivisection specimen. accompanying them is a creature whose mouth is wired into a gaping rectangle the exposed teeth sharpened to points, and a fat sweating monster whose eyes are covered by dark glasses. when the lead cenobite speaks, we recognise the voice as that of the creature from the beginning of the film. kirsty stares in amazement.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{where the hell did you come from?}
<A>__{the cenobite gestures. the box is lying on the bed.}
<C>__{cenobite}
<D>__{the box ... you opened it. we came.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{it's just a puzzle box.}
<C>__{cenobite}
<D>__{it's a means to summon us it's called the lament con figuration.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{cenobite}
<D>__{cenobites. explorers in the further regions of experience. demons to some. angels to others.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{well, i didn't mean to open that thing. you can go back wherever you came from.}
<C>__{female cenobite}
<D>__{we can't. not alone.}
<A>__{at this, the creature with the wired open jaw chatters like a mad monkey.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{this isn't for real.}
<C>__{cenobite}
<D>__{you solved the box. we came. now you must come with us. taste our pleasures.}
<A>__{the chattering cenobite steps towards her.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{don't touch me!}
<A>__{the door opens. it's steve. kirsty's face floods with relief. steve does not register the cenobites' presence however.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{steve. thank god you came.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{what happened to you?}
<A>__{he steps between the cenobites.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{these things ... they want to take me }
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{what things?}
<C>__{cenobite}
<P>__{(to kirsty)}
<D>__{he doesn't see us, or hear us. we belong to you, kirsty. and you to us.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{don't let them take me, steve }
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i won't let anybody take you.}
<A>__{he starts to walk towards her, but the creature in the dark glasses takes a hooked rod from its back and puts the hook to steve's neck. steve's hand moves to the place; he makes a small sound of pain. the cenobite takes off its glasses, to see its trick better. the eyes beneath are sewn shut. it pulls a little more on the hook. steve winces.}
<C>__{female cenobite}
<D>__{if he takes another step, we open his throat.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(to steve)}
<D>__{please go, steve.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{just go. please. i will be ok. i'm going to go see dad. he'll look after me }
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(protesting)}
<D>__{what did i say?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{will you go, damn you?}
<A>__{mystified, steve retreats a step.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i will come back later, huh?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{sure. why not?}
<A>__{still puzzled, steve crosses to the door.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{'bye.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{'bye.}
<C>__{female cenobite}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{cenobite}
<D>__{it's time we were away.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(almost crying)}
<D>__{let me alone, will you?}
<C>__{cenobite}
<D>__{no tears please. it's a waste of good suffering.}
<A>__{the chatterer comes for her. as it does so desperation brings a plan to kirsty's head.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{he stops.}
<C>__{cenobite}
<D>__{no time for argument.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{you did this before, right?}
<C>__{cenobite}
<D>__{many times.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{to a man called frank cotton?}
<C>__{female cenobite}
<D>__{oh yes.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{but he escaped you.}
<C>__{cenobite}
<D>__{nobody escapes us.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{he did. i've seen him. he's alive.}
<C>__{cenobite}
<D>__{is that so? and what are you proposing?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{i will take you to him. then you take him instead of me. back wherever you come from.}
<A>__{the cenobite stares at her unblinking.}
<C>__{cenobite}
<D>__{perhaps ...}
<C>__{female cenobite}
<D>__{but if you cheat us ...}
<A>__{the sound of the engineer, scratching on the other side of the wall. the plaster cracks, violently.}
<C>__{cenobite}
<D>__{we'll tear your soul apart!}
<A>__{we cut back to the cracking plaster, which cracks further. we hear steve's voice, and pan back into the room. the door opens. kirsty and the cenobites have gone. steve is there, with the nurse.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{she was trembling all over.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{i'd better go look for her.}
<A>__{the nurse heads for the door.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{maybe she's gone back to her }
<A>__{he looks round. the nurse has gone.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{ father.}
<A>__{his eyes have alighted on the box, which is lying on the bed. he picks it up.}
