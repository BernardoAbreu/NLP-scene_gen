<L>__{interior large stately library night}
<A>__{a group of men are standing, looking at something on a tv monitor. a surveillance video. they turn when the w.m.m. enters. camera favoring a small lean man with close cropped hair. he is at once elegant and imposing with eyes that hold you with laser like acuity. he is conrad strughold. the others are of various ethnicities, tailored and dignified. this might be a collection of u.n. delegates. indeed some are. their business here, however, doesn't represent anyone's interests but their own. as tipped by the attendance of a group elder from the u.s. who we've come to know. but, more importantly, by the cigarette smoking man who holds the vcr remote. he pauses the picture.}
<C>__{strughold}
<D>__{we began to worry. some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive. well manicured man i'm sorry. my grandson fell and broke his leg.}
<A>__{the non response to this has the same effect as a reprimand. but the w.m.m. will not apologize of kowtow.}
<C>__{strughold}
<D>__{while we've been made to wait, we've watched surveillance tapes which have raised more concerns.}
<A>__{the well manicured man glances to the tv, sees the frame paused.}
<B>__{his pov of tv monitor}
<A>__{where mulder and scully's faces are seen in a hallway that we recognize as the bethesda naval hospital. resume well manicured man}
<D>__{well manicured man more concerns than that?}
<C>__{strughold}
<D>__{we've been forced to reassess our role in colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.}
<C>__{group elder}
<P>__{(speaking up)}
<D>__{the virus has mutated. well manicured man on its own?}
<C>__{cigarette smoking man}
<D>__{its effect on the host has changed. the virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. it's developed a way to modify the host body. well manicured man into what?}
<C>__{strughold}
<D>__{a new extraterrestrial biological entity.}
<A>__{it takes a moment to sink in. the weight of this fact.}
<D>__{well manicured man my god...}
<C>__{strughold}
<D>__{the geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re evaluations for us. about our place in their colonization. well manicured man this isn't colonization, it's spontaneous repopulation. all our work... if it's true, then they've been using us all along. we've been laboring under a lie! 2nd elder it could be an isolated case. well manicured man how can we know?!}
<C>__{strughold}
<D>__{we're going to tell them what we've found. what we've learned. turn over a body infected with the gestating organism. well manicured man in hope of what? learning that it's true?! that we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!}
<C>__{strughold}
<D>__{let me remind you who is the new race. and who is the old.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what could be gained by withholding anything from them; by pretending to ignorance? our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. to start colonization early. well manicured man and if it doesn't? by cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! our ignorance was in cooperating with the colonists at all.}
<C>__{strughold}
<D>__{cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.}
<C>__{cigarette smoking man}
<D>__{they still need us to carry out their preparations.}
<C>__{strughold}
<D>__{we'll continue to use them as they do us. if only to play for more time, to continue work on our vaccine. well manicured man our vaccine may have no effect!}
<C>__{strughold}
<D>__{well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.}
<A>__{all eyes go to the well manicured man. he is respected, if not the odd man out in this room. but he is all restrained anger now.}
<D>__{well manicured man my lateness may have well been absence. a course has already been taken.}
<C>__{cigarette smoking man}
<D>__{there are complications.}
<A>__{he turns back to the tv monitor where mulder and scully remain frozen on the screen.}
<D>__{well manicured man do they know?}
<C>__{cigarette smoking man}
<D>__{mulder was in dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. he's gone back there again. someone has tipped him. well manicured man who?}
<C>__{cigarette smoking man}
<D>__{kurtzweil, we think.}
<C>__{strughold}
<D>__{we've allowed this man his freedom. his books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. has he outlived his usefulness to us? well manicured man no one believes kurtzweil or his books. he's a toiler. a crank.}
<C>__{strughold}
<D>__{and mulder?}
<C>__{elder}
<D>__{our new situation makes us vulnerable. if he learns information as we do, he could jeopardize the project's secrecy. 2nd elder control of information means control of mulder.}
<C>__{cigarette smoking man}
<D>__{i can control mulder. i've always controlled mulder.}
<C>__{strughold}
<D>__{this may take another approach.}
<A>__{he says this, casting his look toward the well manicured man. a look of cold malevolence. the w.m.m.'s reaction is disdain.}
<D>__{well manicured man you can't kill mulder. he's got too much light on him.}
<C>__{strughold}
<D>__{you need not kill a man to destroy him. well manicured man}
<P>__{(personalizing the inference)}
<D>__{no, you need only take away what is most precious to him.}
