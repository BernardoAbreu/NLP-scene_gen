<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{you're sure?}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{i think if he told me he was going to steal van gogh's "sunflowers in a vase" i would remember it.}
<C>__{sami}
<P>__{(correcting him)}
<D>__{"vase with twelve sunflowers."}
<C>__{marcel}

<C>__{sami}
<D>__{it makes sense. i mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?}

<D>__{all you are is a professional ass kisser.}

<A>__{they take a step towards each other. sami steps in between them.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{i said knock it off! now as far as i'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{it's simple. bastaldi's moving up. he's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.}
