<A>__{a dark sky ...and in the foreground, profiled against a full moon, a dark face ...watching the heavens with piercing black eyes, alert, though not predatory. this is chris redfield, young, handsome. more than simply an outdoor type, he seems perfectly in place, almost part of the environment. a band of purple tints the horizon, outlining the tops of magnificent uncorrupted hills that extend for miles. sitting on a ridge, squinting into that band of light, chris sees ... ...an eagle coasting on a channel of wind that cuts through the hilltops. as the bird moves swiftly closer, it becomes recognizable. chris smiles and jots a note on a pad. the regal bird lands on a high rock where ...unexpectedly... a freshwater trout lies flapping, three thousand feet above the highest water.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{take it, goliath. it's yours.}
<A>__{"goliath" snaps up the fish and flies away with it.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{see ya next year, guy.}
<A>__{chris reaches into a water filled bucket, pulls out another trout, climbs efficiently, unerringly, across a precarious cliffside, and deposits the fresh fish on the same high rock. another eagle, smaller, a female, appears in the sky.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{cleopatra.}
<A>__{chris scrambles back to his place and jots another note. "cleopatra" spots the fish, pumps her wings, and swoops down. she's about to snap up the prize, but at the last minute, she recoils and climbs again, hovering.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{come on. come on down.}
<A>__{the eagle circles, its sharp eyes scanning. it makes another dive, but stops short again.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{what's the matter, beautiful?}
<A>__{the bird seems frightened. of what? it makes one more dive. gets very close to the fish... but suddenly shrieks and peels, away from the rock. chris sees its eyes, looking crazed, as it soars right past him, its wings brushing his hair. close on: chris, concerned, as he watches the eagle disappear over the hills. over his shoulder, we can see the high rock that holds the fish. it's out of focus in the background, but the moonlight catches something moving there. something that lets out a sharp inhuman sound. chris whirls around. there's nothing on the rock. nothing at all. the fish has been taken.}
