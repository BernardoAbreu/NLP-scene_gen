<L>__{interior bus moments later}
<A>__{more mind blowingly badass funk music over seth, evan and fogell sitting on the bus amidst a bunch of gloomy, unpleasant looking strangers. nothing happens whatsoever.}
<L>__{exterior liquor store evening}
<A>__{the bus stops in front of the liquor store and the guys get out.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{well, here we are. fogell, are you ready?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{here's the list.}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{a list? why?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{we're getting girls their booze so they'll get with us. i put a lot of thought into that list. it's the perfect party bar, so don't mess it up and get sambuca again.}
<A>__{fogell reads the list. a worried look sweeps across his face.}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{ouzo, drambuie, jager, gold shlay ger }
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{goldschlager. that's for helen, so do not forget it.}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{ alize, captain morgan rum, smirnoff rasberry and a big ass bottle of popov }
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{oh yeah, and mike's hard lemonade.}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{this is too much. i can't get away with this much!}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{what's the difference?}
<A>__{seth hands fogell the money.}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{i don't know, man. i'm getting, like, really nervous.}
<A>__{fogell starts breathing very hard and making an odd noise while doing so.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing?}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{i don't know if i want to do this.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{what are you talking about? you just promised you would. what is this shit?}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{what if they turn me down?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{then we're in the same place that we're in right now!}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{it's fucking humiliating! everyone in the store sees them kicking me out. what if they make me put all the liquor back on the shelf? i can't do that!}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{this whole thing is bigger than you, asshead! just go in there and buy the damn alcohol!}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{what if i don't feel like it anymore?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{then i will kill you! how's that? if you don't buy the alcohol, i will kill you!}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{killing me won't get you any alcohol, jerkoff! i'm the one with the id!}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{then i will kill you, cut off your ugly face, put it over mine, and buy it my fucking self.}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{you don't have the technology or the steady hands to pull off a procedure like that!}
<A>__{seth stands for a moment, then suddenly rushes fogell. evan stands between them and breaks it up.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{seth, calm down! fogell, stop being a baby and go buy the alcohol! you said you'd do it, so do it. it's why you bought the id, so just go do it.}
<C>__{fogell}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i will try.}
<A>__{fogell walks into the store.}
