<L>__{interior matt's apt. day}
<A>__{matt on phone, jeannie standing next to him reaching for the phone.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(to jeannie)}
<D>__{not yet. don't grab.}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{thank you. we really appreciate this. hi, beth. i...}
<A>__{jeannie grabs the phone in a flash.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<P>__{(softly into phone)}
<D>__{mom? no... nothing... nothing... nothing. nothing... would you talk? i'd just like to listen to you... wait. let me sit down.}
<A>__{jeannie sits herself by the window, protected by an iron grill, and sits listening to her mother. there is about this pose something prescient; unmistakably, jeannie will look this way again as a young woman cloaked in the love of some guy... but for now it's her mother, her crazy mother, who blots out dread. matt is struck by how quiet and adoring jeannie looks even as he moves to give his daughter some privacy. several beats, jeannie noticing her dad looking at her switching positions, body language indicating that she wants to put him out of her mind... then a thought.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{dad says he's going to make me to really cry.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{jeannie, your mom's not going to understand what you mean.}
<A>__{jeannie shushes him, resisting with surprising will and strength when he tries to get the phone.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<P>__{(to matt)}
<D>__{she understands!!!}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{he's being terrible right now.}
<P>__{(faster; avoiding matt)}
<D>__{i love, loved, the coloring book you sent me. goodbye. wait. i love you. let me hang up first. love you. send me a letter. bye. and a beaded t shirt. bye.}
<A>__{she hangs up. matt pissed.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{why don't you let me be on your side for a second?}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{i can't even understand what you're saying now.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{do you know what trust means?}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{not very.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it means that even if something is hard to believe, you believe someone you trust because you know he wouldn't say it unless it were true.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{i understand. so i don't trust anybody, right?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yeah, i think you get the concept.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{you don't make sense. i don't understand you.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i think you do.}
<A>__{jeannie reacts broadly... indicating what a difficult man she's stuck with.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{just know that...}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{okayyyy!}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(giving up)}
<D>__{you want to help me make a phone call?}
<A>__{she goes quickly to the phone and picks it up.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{seven... two...}
<C>__{jeannie}
<P>__{(hitting numbers)}
<D>__{who are we calling?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{cathy. she's very nice. one... six...}
<C>__{jeannie}
<P>__{(hard to read)}
<D>__{"very nice..." one...}
