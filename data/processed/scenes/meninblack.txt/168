<A>__{kay's hand reaches closer and closer to the gun...}
<L>__{exterior world's fair on jay night}
<A>__{jay keeps moving toward the bug, finding new roaches to tread on holds his foot over another one.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what's that? can you hear what he's saying? 'help me! help me!'}
<A>__{crunch. [on] the bug as he starts climbing down the tower and moving toward jay. on jay. they are moving toward each other in a show down jay moves on, poising his foot over another roach.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{ooh! there's a pretty one. that one looks kinda familiar, don't you think? i know who that is!}
<A>__{the bug is right over jay now, jaws dripping ready to gobble him up.}
<C>__{bug}
<D>__{don't do that!}
<A>__{jay stares right back at the bug. inside, he sees kay's hand, closing around the trigger of the shotgun. he brings it around, pointing up, straight at the bug's head.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{that's your momma!}
<A>__{he moves to crunch the roach the bug moves to chomp jay jay stares up at him, unflinching...}
<C>__{jay }
<D>__{didn't she ever teach you not to bite off more than you can chew?}
<A>__{and at that very moment... kay blasts a hole right in the middle of the bug's midsection. the front of the bug's thorax explodes in a shower of bug juice all over jay. the bug flies into two pieces the butt end sailing one way; the head flying behind jay. kay falls out of the bug, in a mess of goo, gasping for breath, dropping the atomizer from his slippery fingers. the other gun sails off into the darkness. the icon drops to the ground, rolls over to jay's feet, and clatters to rest like a silver dollar on a barroom floor. he calmly bends down and picks it up. jay is pissed and starts in on kay.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you son of a }
<A>__{kay holds up a finger in a 'wait a minute' gesture pulls out his pocket phone and hits a number.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{zed. get a message to the arquillians. we have the galaxy.}
