<L>__{interior porsche day}
<A>__{the cb continues to crackle with news of the roadblock. jenny's eyes restlessly search the overpass under the whirling yellow chicken for any sign of the star man. she sees the dun colored roadrunner waiting at the foot of the on ramp for a break in the traffic, but she is too far away to see who's inside. as the porsche gets closer, it overtakes an 18 wheeler and jenny's view of the roadrunner is cut off entirely. she passes without seeing the star man.}
