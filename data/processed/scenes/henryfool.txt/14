<C>__{mr deng}
<D>__{you should take him home. he smells like a toilet.}
<A>__{henry nods, agreeing, then lifts simon off the floor. mr deng holds the door open as henry carries his friend out into the parking lot. meanwhile, gnoc gathers up the classics from the floor and places them beside simon's notebook, where it still sits open on the table. she looks at it, then reads. she lifts it off the table and reads further, immediately and deeply engrossed. mr deng watches as henry departs with simon, then comes back into the store and stops, startled, when he sees... gnoc sitting there, staring off into space, the notebook open in her hands before her, singing quietly.}
