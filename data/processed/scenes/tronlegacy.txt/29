<L>__{interior encom advanced research lab moments later}
<A>__{out the elevator, meg leads them into a maze of ultra tech gear.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{this is where flynn worked. and where he died.}
<A>__{amid sleek new equipment, there's a glass cabinet housing a charred remnant of strange machinery.}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{meg has reconstructed flynn's last project. this time it works.}
<A>__{mega signals lab assistant dewey. he pokes buttons: a massive technical device unfolds and boots up.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{you didn't pick this up at circuit city. what is it?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{a quantum digitizer. prototype, only one of its kind. flynn designed it to break down physical objects into high resolution data. luckily, we salvaged his key components and back engineered the system.}
<A>__{she opens a cage, places her lab rat (jo jo) on a target stage. dewey boots controls, presses commands. beam array scans the rat into the computer, forming a 3d rat image on screens, dematerializing the physical rat. device revs down. rush runs his hand over the empty target stage.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{that's... not possible.}
<A>__{lab rat has vanished from the physical world. its digitized image rotates on monitors.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{flynn was trying to take it one step further. he wanted to transport a human being into cyberspace.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{you mean the urban legends? a computer sucked flynn into cyberspace a long time ago.}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{we think it happened.}
<A>__{meg agrees. rush gets a chill.}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{it was a fluke. but flynn worked for years, down here, trying to make it happen again. one day a test went bad. a plasma reaction destroyed this lab. flynn was reduced to ash.}
<A>__{rush views the charred remains in the glass case. photos of the destroyed lab. spooky evidence of a hellish death scene.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{i was never told how he died. it was all just weird, you know, because flynn's the guy who hired me. but he was strange, kept to himself, i didn't know what job i was supposed to be doing.}
<P>__{(to sinclair)}
<D>__{then you came onboard, the company woke up, we had a direction. it was kind of pathetic, because by the time flynn died, everybody was too busy to care.}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{he was brilliant in his way, but genius without discipline leads to nothing. his reckless habits nearly ruined this company... and for sure got him killed.}
<A>__{a last look at the charred remains of flynn's machine.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{that kind of accident can't happen again. we've upgraded the system in ways flynn never could. the chips didn't exist until now.}
<A>__{she presses commands. beams re materialize the lab rat on the target stage. jo jo is as good as new.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{hey, jo jo. have good trip?}
<A>__{she puts the rat in on her shoulder, feeds it a tidbit. then she scrutinizes rush. rush considers meg, then turns to sinclair.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{you want her to send me into cyberspace to catch that jerk who hacked us?}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{the future of this company depends on it.}
<A>__{rush looks to meg. she offers a reassuring nod.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{you can bring me back okay?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{ask jo jo.}
<A>__{lab rat is perched happily on her shoulder.}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{destroy the intruder by 9am tomorrow, rush. i know if anyone can, it's you. i've had my eye on you for a long time. score this hit and i will make you my full partner in this company.}
<A>__{rush is awe struck. ready, willing, able. he shakes sinclair's hand, sealing the deal.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{i won't let you down. let's do it.}
<A>__{meg removes target stage, swings a custom target chair in place. rush lowers in place. meg buckles him in. last chance for a private word:}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{i promise i will get you back safely by 9am tomorrow. but you have to promise me something too }
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{you're a piece of work. you dumped me because you said i was too much about the company's needs and not enough about yours. well here we are, the company needs their best guy, and you just can't admit how much to hurts to nominate me.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{this bigger than us, rush. listen to me. i don't know what you're going to find in there, but whatever it is, promise you'll follow your heart and do the right thing.}
<A>__{rush stares at here, in shock.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{oh. so you think i have a heart?}
<A>__{meg breaks away, retreating to the controls with sinclair. rush's trails her with his eyes he can't stop looking.}
<C>__{rush}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{i promise.}
<A>__{meg initiates quantum digitizer sequence. rush watches pulsing chromatic light build down the unit's column, coming toward him. plasma strobes cyan magenta. unit hums... then groans wildly. flashes randomize. something's off balance meg worries. moves for the "abort" button.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{it's overloading!}
<A>__{unit sparks. ceramic components stress and crack. rush clenches his seat, terrified.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{what's happening?!}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{system is losing stability!}
<A>__{sinclair sees: monitor sounds company wide alert: "x net breech! intruder detected!"}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{there's been another breech!}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{it's the intruder again!}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{we have to abort!}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{we might not get another chance!}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{do it!}
<A>__{sinclair pulls meg's hand from the "abort" button and slams his hand on "digitize". beam array scans rush's body, reducing it to bits meg worries sinclair dives for cover plasma ball engulfs quantum digitizer. final bits of rush scan away. plasma ball fries the unit. breakers trip. power fades. meg and sinclair come up to find: quantum digitizer: in a smoking heap. target chair: empty.}
