<L>__{exterior space. night}
<A>__{outside, woody slaps a big square patch over the hole, rips off the backing.}
<B>__{close on the patch}
<A>__{as it changes color and shrinks, drawing itself down into the metal of the hull.}
<L>__{interior cockpit. night}
<A>__{very close on the computer's interior. as phil's fingers re connect the same plug.}
<B>__{phil pulls his hand out}
<A>__{from inside the computer bay. he's trembling, sweat streaked inside his faceplate. blood has soaked through his gauze pads. his good hand hovers over the red main power switch. the moment of truth.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{ok... ok now...}
<A>__{with a dramatic click, he throws the switch, hard booting the computer system back on. he stares at the screens. nothing happens!}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{come on. come on...!}
<A>__{frightened, furious, phil bangs on the switch with his cordless screwdriver. when all else fails, hit something.}
