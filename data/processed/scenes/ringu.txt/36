<L>__{exterior outside an apartment door day}
<A>__{the bearded man, whose name is ryuji, reaches out to press the doorbell, but the door has already opened from within. asakawa leans out, holding the door open for him. neither of them speaks. wordlessly, ryuji enters the apartment.}
<L>__{interior asakawas apartment day}
<A>__{ryuji puts his bag down, looks around the apartment. the interior is dark, ominous somehow. he takes his jacket off and wanders into the living room. asakawa is in the kitchen behind him, preparing tea. ryuji spies the collection of framed photographs in living room.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{yoichis in elementary school already, is he?}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{his first year. what about you, ryuji? how have you been recently?}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{same as always.}
<A>__{she takes a seat next to him, serves the tea. on the coffee table before them is a videotape in a plain, unmarked case.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{and money is...?}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{im teaching at university.}
<A>__{ryuji picks up his cup of tea but stops, grimacing, before it is to his lips. he rubs his forehead as if experiencing a sudden headache. ryuji shakes it off and quickly regains his composure.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{anyway. you said that the phone rang?}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{thats right.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{so if i watch it too, that phone over there }
<A>__{he gestures with his mug}
<C>__{ryuji }
<D>__{ should ring.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{ryuji, four people have already died. on the same day!}
<C>__{ryuji}
<P>__{(flippant)}
<D>__{well, why dont you try calling an exorcist?}
<A>__{he takes a sip of his tea. asakawa reaches quickly, grabs something from the bookshelf behind her a polaroid camera. she shoves it into ryujis hands, then turns to look down at the floor.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{take my picture.}
<A>__{ryuji raises the camera to his eye.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{turn this way.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<P>__{(unmoving)}
<D>__{hurry up and take it.}
<A>__{ryuji snaps off a shot. it comes out the other end and he takes it, waits impatiently for an image to appear. when it does, all he can do is pass it wordlessly over to asakawa. her face is twisted, misshapen. just like the picture of tomoko and her friends. asakawa stares at it, horrified. by the time she finally looks up, ryuji has already risen from his seat and slid the videotape into the vcr. again, the screen is filled with static, only to be replaced with what looks like the moon. asakawa slams the polaroid on the coffee table and goes outside onto the veranda.}
