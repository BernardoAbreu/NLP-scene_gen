<L>__{interior arizona ramada inn lobby night}
<A>__{all enter the lobby like warriors, in a pack. the hotel chairs are spotted with curious hangers on, decked out and lounging. dick is already stationed, as always, at the front desk. the sad state of hotel service grates on a road dog like dick. he is forever teaching others their jobs.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{jeff, tony... keys... keys... keys... room list...}
<P>__{(re: luggage, to hotel bellman)}
<D>__{if it doesn't have a number on it, it ain't ours!}
<A>__{he gives key and a stack of messages to russell, and turns to william who he makes feel more important. penny is nearby with her suitcase and tackle box purse. william watches russell's guitars whisked away they are luggage numbered 1, 3, and 4.}
<C>__{dick }
<D>__{the enemy! here you go, here's the key to your palatial suite, room list, plus let me give you a luggage tag. you're number 42.}

<C>__{william}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{clerk}
<P>__{(confidentially)}
<D>__{she's a handful.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{william cooly takes the folded message, doesn't look at it, and tries to pretend this embarrassing moment didn't happen. jeff exchanges a look with russell. nearby, the walking commotion arrives, clacking through the lobby. it's sapphire. last night's clothes are now today's. she holds a travel case, and hanger with some odd blouses.}
<C>__{sapphire}
<D>__{finally, you're here!! they kicked me out of my room! fuck ozzy!}
<A>__{she hugs penny lane. estrella appears, happy to have help with sapphire.}
<B>__{on russell}
<A>__{who approaches william.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{come by in a few minutes. we'll do the interview.}
<A>__{the kid exits and goes to join penny, who is still comforting sapphire. russell looks through his messages. the guitar, now in a case, never leaves his hand. jeff bebe approaches, regarding william standing with penny and the girls. intrigue is swirling in the lobby.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i'm worried, man.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{naw, we can trust him. he's a fan.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{but it's rolling stone.}
<A>__{he looks}
<D>__{harmless, but he does represent the magazine that trashed eric clapton, broke up cream, ripped led zeppelin, and wrote that lame story about the allman brothers band that bummed duane out before he died. don't forget the rules. this little shit is the enemy. he writes what he sees.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but it would be cool to be on the cover.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{leave it to me. we'll get a good story.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{plus our girlfriends read this magazine and }
<P>__{(looking at band aids)}
<D>__{ you know.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{you made your pointerior i will take to him.}
<B>__{on william by elevator}
<A>__{penny speaks confidentially to him. if she is slightly bossy, it is only because she's good at logistics, emotional and otherwise.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{can sapphire stay in your room tonight? she had a big fight with ozzy, and polexia's not working out with jeff bebe.}
<P>__{(to sapphire and polexia)}
<D>__{you just have to remember... these guys are jealous, insecure, talented, egocentric, and manipulative geniuses... they're lead singers.}
<A>__{they can say}
<D>__{"i love you" to 20,000 people... but any fewer is a real problem.}
<P>__{(girls nod, comforted, she continues to the kid)}
<D>__{jeff bebe has so much jealousy over russell that he can't express. plus, he never slept last night. you keep sapphire and i will stay with russell.}
<A>__{william covers his disappointment over losing penny as a roommate. cooly:}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{sure. i will take her.}
<C>__{polexia}
<D>__{me too?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{estrella arrives with travel bag, equally homeless, looking hopeful.}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{if there's room }
<A>__{penny squeezes him. he feels cool... but the girl he really wanted to stay in his room now joins russell, disappearing into the elevator. he looks down at the message in his hand, and opens it. it reads: don't take drugs! he snaps it closed quickly, before anyone can see. in. russell's room night russell plays acoustic guitar, a notebook cradled on his lap. trying to write. it's coming slowly. shot moves off him, past a flickering television, onto penny who silently and intently watches russell as if he's a rare and beautiful bird. he looks over at her she turns away quickly. he goes back to work. tries to catch her watching him again. she turns away just in time.}
