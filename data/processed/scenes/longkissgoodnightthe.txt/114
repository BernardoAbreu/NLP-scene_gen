<L>__{interior cellar same time}
<A>__{the same cellar she occupied earlier. timothy behind her, he wrinkles his nose in distaste.}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{shit, this place is loaded with fumes, nobody light a fucking match. you check her for flammables?}
<C>__{gun guard}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{checked her for colon cancer.}
<A>__{caitlin is sitting in a chair. bundled in flannel, clutching her baby doll, the one perkins bought for her. she looks up at charly dully. sucking her thumb.}
<C>__{caitlin}
<D>__{mommy...}
<A>__{charly composes herself.}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{shhhhh. mommy's here, it's okay. safe and snug... what comes next, huh...? what's the next part?}
<C>__{caitlin}
<D>__{...bug in a rug... man with white hair... says the same thing you say...}
<A>__{charly licks her lips. easy, charly, keep cool, she mustn't die afraid...}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{we're going to take a nap together, cate. you can have your dolly, and mommy will be next to you, how's that? it'll be like bears in winter. when they get cold, see, they fall deep, deep asleep...}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{bears, yeah, yeah. enough.}
<A>__{he points to the steel door of the meat freezer. the guard opens it onto a gleaming silver chamber. timothy calmly adjusts the thermostat. sub zero. the guard reaches for caitlin's doll... charly snatches it back. face etched in disgust.}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{you're murdering us both, cocksucker, let the kid have her fucking dolly.}
<A>__{he subsides, unable to meet her gaze. at which point, timothy tosses her the wooden box.}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{chuck, i'm not a total creep. i will make you a deal, okay? there's a knife in that box. now, you and the kid, you're going to freeze, but if you kill the kid by your own hand...? i won't kill your husband. serious. we're gonna open that door and you'll both be frozen solid, but i wanna know that you've cut your own child's throat.}
<A>__{you don't want to ever be on the receiving end of the look she gives him... steps into the freezer, holding caitlin. as the door starts to swing shut, she says:}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{it ain't over, motherfucker. you're gonna die screaming and i'm gonna watch. am i telling the truth...?}
<A>__{she flashes him her most dazzling smile the whole room lights up. she can do that. as the door erases her from view, a chill dances up timothy's spine... because there was nothing resembling doubt on her face.}
