<L>__{interior mike's apartment night}
<A>__{he hasn't moved. the phone rings. he looks to the answering machine hopefully as it picks up after one ring.}
<C>__{answering machine}
<P>__{(rob's voice)}
<D>__{mikey...? it's rob. pick up, buddy.}
<A>__{his shoulders slack with disappointment. it's not her.}
<C>__{answering machine}
<P>__{(rob's voice)}
<D>__{... i'm downstairs. buzz me in. i know you're home. your lights are on and your car's here. come on, buddy. open up...}
<A>__{mike picks up the phone, pushes "9", and hangs up. he lights a cigarette. a knock at the door. mike opens it, and rob walks in with a brown bag. he surveys the scene. he's seen this before. he moves some laundry off an armchair and sits down. he pulls a pepperoni and a loaf of seminola out of the bag. he hands mike a pint of orange juice.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{thanks, man.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{no problem, buddy. you eat anything today?}
<A>__{mike shakes his head, "no".}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{yesterday?}
<A>__{mike shakes his head again.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you haven't been drinking, have you?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{no. just o.j.}
<A>__{rob cuts into the pepperoni with his swiss army knife. mike drinks his juice.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{sorry about what happened at the dresden. i had no idea...}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{don't sweat it. now i got an l.a. gun story. you should hear the way i tell to the guys back home. he had an uzi.}
<A>__{mike half smiles. beat.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you want to talk about it?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{what's the point?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{it's been two days. you should call that girl nikki...}
<A>__{mike grabs his head in pain.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{uuuuugh!}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{oh boy.}
<C>__{mike}

<D>__{she wasn't your type anyway.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i think i'm gonna move back east.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{well, that's dumb.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{what's dumb about it?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{well, you're doing so well...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{how am i doing well? i host an open mike and i played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. big fuckin' deal. i'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. how good am i doing?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{at least you didn't get turned down for goofy...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{they turned you down?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{they went for someone with more theme park experience. i woulda killed for that job.}
<A>__{mike lets it sink in.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{see, it's all how you look at it. if your life sucks, then mine is god awful. i mean, i moved out here partially because i saw how well you were doing. you got in the union, you got an agent. i thought if you could make it, maybe i could too...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i didn't make it...}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{that's your problem, man. you can't see what you've got, only what you've lost. those guys are right. you are "money".}
<A>__{mike smiles, then...}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(starting to cry)}
<D>__{then why won't she call...?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{because you left, man. she's got her own world to deal with in new york. she was a sweet girl but fuck her. you gotta move on. you gotta let go of the past. the future is so beautiful. every day is so sunny out here. it's like manifest destiny man. i mean, we made it. what's past is prologue. that which does not kill us makes us stronger. all that shit. you'll get over it.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{how did you get over it? i mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{sometimes is still hurts. you know how it is, man. i mean, each day you think about it less and less. and then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. it's kinda weird. you miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. and the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.}
<A>__{we see that mike has been gnawing away at rob's pepperoni and semolina as he listens intently.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you miss the pain?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{... for the same reason you miss her. you lived with it so long.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{wow.}
<P>__{(finishing the loaf)}
<D>__{you wanna grab a bite?}
<C>__{rob}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{he helps mike up.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{by the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{you always know the right thing to say.}
