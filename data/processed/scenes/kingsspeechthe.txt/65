<A>__{churchill makes his way to elizabeth, who is standing in front of a portrait of george iv.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i don't need to be told i behaved badly.}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{on the contrary, mam. court etiquette decrees royalty must be greeted by the official host. in this case: the king. you behaved impeccably. as always.}
<C>__{winston churchill }
<P>__{(referring to the painting)}
<D>__{a relative?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{distant.}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<P>__{(referring again to the painting)}
<D>__{you're well aware, of course, george iv's wife, mrs. fitzherbert, was very common indeed...and previously married. she signed an agreement that she could never become queen, and their children could not be royal. a rather sensible morganatic arrangement.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{that was a very long time ago. you're stirring with a rather large spoon, winston. keep in mind, i'm also a distant relative of lady macbeth.}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{i would disremember at my peril.}
<A>__{david is coming briskly down the corridor, struggling to open a champagne bottle, followed by bertie determined to catch up. elizabeth and churchill leave the brothers alone.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{david...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{wally wants more champagne. i have to fetch it. she prefers that.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{been trying to see you...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{been terribly busy.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{doing what?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{being king.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{where did you get that american accent? david...father's not dead six months, yet you've put mrs. simpson in the suite used by our mother?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{mama's not still in bed, is she?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{that isn't funny.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{ssssssorry, d d dear b b oy!}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{please. no more of that.}
<A>__{a moment of silent confrontation. david backs down. sort of.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{didn't realize you cared.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{this could end in disaster.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{this will end splendidly. with wallis as my wife.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{whatever will she call herself?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{queen of england, i suspect. kings do marry. empress of india. the whole bag of tricks.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{david! the upper classes are terrified anything which clouds the monarchy makes their situation more dangerous. hunger marchers are singing the "red flag" in front of westminster...demanding a republic...i've seen them...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{herr hitler will sort that out.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{who'll sort out chancellor hitler?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{he's much maligned. by the jews, according to wallis. and she's very clever about politics.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{the man's a monster! our position must remain clear.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{why's that, old chap?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{we are a german family!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{didn't bother anyone during wwi. and kaiser willie was our uncle.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{because we took an english name! windsor. because we are england. we are the heart and soul of this nation. that must never change.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{are you already in charge?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i'm trying to warn you.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{am i being threatened?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{david, your role is to consult and to be advised.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{sounds like you've studied our wretched constitution.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{sounds like you haven't.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i won't be a lackey to an unwashed politician like stanley baldwin!}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{he's your prime minister.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{and i'm his king!}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{if you refuse to listen to our government, they have no choice but to resign.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i will form another. there's winston. he'd love to be p.m. we'll create a king's party.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{to fight a general election in which your marriage is the only topic?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'd risk anything and everything for wallis. don't i have rights?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{privileges.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{not the same thing.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yet an ordinary man may marry for love.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{we're not ordinary men, david! we were bred to be profiles on a coin. if you were ordinary, on what basis could you possibly claim to be king?!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what's the point then? just to look posh? you know...your speech is much improved tonight. hardly a hesitation. yearning for a larger audience, are we?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{don't say such a thing!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{is my young brother trying to push me off the throne? sounds positively medieval.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i beg of you, don't do this to my wife, my daughters, to me.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{the politicians will give in. see you at my coronation...bertie.}
<A>__{the champagne cork finally pops. he strides off.}
