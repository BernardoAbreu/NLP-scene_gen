<L>__{interior springbok team room cape town hotel night}
<A>__{normally a conference room, now equipped with fridge, pool table, ping pong, sofas, tv etc. the entire team has assembled, minus pienaar. a quiet air. serious, relaxed. pienaar enters, holding a sheaf of xeroxed pages, begins to hand them out.}
<C>__{springbok hooker}
<D>__{what's this? homework?}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{sort of.}
<A>__{the players look down at the pages. on a page: the words to nkosi sikelel' iafrika, in xhosa. one by one, the players look from the page to pienaar.}
<C>__{springbok wing}
<D>__{cappie? what's this?}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{we need to learn it. we can't just mouth the words anymore.}
<C>__{springbok hooker}
<D>__{nobody cares, as long as we win matches.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{they do care.}
<C>__{springbok lock}
<D>__{it's their song, not ours.}
<C>__{springbok wing}
<D>__{it's a terrorist song.}
<C>__{springbok prop}
<D>__{they used to arrest you for singing it.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{and now it's one of our anthems.}
<A>__{but he's talking to a deeply conservative group of guys.}
<C>__{springbok hooker}
<D>__{cap. you know i leave my guts on the field for you, and you know i'd follow you into a fight anywhere, any time. but this ...}
<A>__{the hooker crumples the page, is about to throw it away.}
<C>__{springbok hooker}
<D>__{... i can't even read it. i definitely can't pronounce the words.}
<A>__{one look at his men, and pienaar knows he has hit a wall.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{okay, boys. it's optional. take it if you want to.}
<A>__{the players are relieved. pienaar looks down at the sheet of paper for a moment, then looks up at the guys.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{it means "god bless africa".}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{which you have to admit, we could use.}
<A>__{nonetheless, most of the players crumple the pages, toss them into the closest trash can.}
