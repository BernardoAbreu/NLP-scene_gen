<B>__{on belly of the axiom}
<A>__{a row of giant doors open on the side of the ship. multiple gangways automatically extend. connect with built in terminals on the port. the captain walks out gingerly. holding the boot w plant. the other passengers step out on their own legs. wobble like toddlers. they squint up at the harsh sunlight. a commotion is heard from the back. somebody trying to push through.}
<B>__{eve}
<A>__{appears out of the crowd. cradles a boxed up wall e in her arms. m o and the rejects follow behind her. they rush across the gangway. the cockroach meets up with eve. climbs up onto wall e. doesn't understand why his master isn't responding. eve urgently scans the landscape. locks on to wall e's truck in the distance. she takes to the air. m o and the rejects chase after her down the gangway.}
