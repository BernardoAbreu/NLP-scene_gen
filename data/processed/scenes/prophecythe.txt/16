<L>__{exterior sandstone canyon morning}
<A>__{deep and narrow, an idyllic canyon of compressed sandstone walls smoothed, rounded and etched by centuries of wind. a tiny creek flows past weak banks of scrub pine and pocked sycamore. a silent place a long way and a long time from anything but the approach of galloping hooves. katherine and her horse run full out through the canyon, the clack and splash of hooves echoing off steep, shadowed walls. horse and rider drive each other harder and harder, their hot breath brief clouds in the arch, thin desert air. boulders shattered by winter cold and summer heat, deep wind cut caves hiding scorpions, sidewinders, or a wary mountain lion all pass as in a blur; arrogant hawks and patient buzzards, ruins of thousand year old anasazi villages high on the cliffs, their weather beaten skulls, seen and unseen, staring out; everything is one smear of color and smell as katherine gallops past them and up the cliff trail, out of the canyon, and onto the main plateau.}
<B>__{on the plateau}
<A>__{katherine strokes her horse and feeds it a bag of carrots. she pulls a thermos from the pack, sits down against some old man rocks, and with the coffee steaming in her hand, greets the sun now cresting the chuska mountains. there's a rutted, silty dirt road nearby. an ancient, battered school bus rattles its way past and stops. the bus driver, a navaho, john, climbs down and rubbing the side of his head painfully walks up to katherine.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you could save my life with some coffee.}
<A>__{he holds out an empty cup katherine fills. sipping painfully, he lays down beside her and pulls the brim of his baseball cap over his eyes.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{tough night?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you don't want to hear about it.}

<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{shouldn't they be getting to school?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{impromptu field trip. i'm broadening their minds. and sparing them the sight of their beloved chauffeur barfing his guts out.}
<A>__{katherine's horse snorts.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i hate horses. how was the canyon? honey suckle out yet?}
<C>__{katherine}

<D>__{i hate that canyon. i hate this this whole plateau. too many goddamn ghosts. leave it to them i say. san diego, that's where i'm going. or oxnard. i like the sound of that. ox nard.}

<D>__{i'm happy here.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh lord protect us, another romantic pale face in love with the desert.}

<D>__{try growing up here.}
<P>__{(tries word out on tongue)}
<D>__{ox nard.}
<P>__{(sticks out coffee cup)}
<D>__{uno mas, see boo play.}
<P>__{(she pours)}
<D>__{speaking of romantic pale faces, the rumor mill is in high gear again.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{who this time?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{that funny looking guy from window rock. the bia lawyer.}
<C>__{katherine}
<P>__{(non committal)}
<D>__{huh.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no! say it isn't so!}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{it isn't so.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he finishes the coffee and climbs painfully to his feet.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{thanks for the joe.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{no prob.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you're a credit to the community.}
<A>__{he shuffles back to the bus.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{all right children, looks sharp! this is a school day! and no talking loud!}
<A>__{the bus coughs alive and crawls forward. katherine waves to the faces behind glass, then settles back for a last moment of peace as silence lays again over the land.}
