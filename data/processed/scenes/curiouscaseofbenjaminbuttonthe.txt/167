<L>__{interior benjamin's room, nolan house night, 1945}
<A>__{benjamin lying on his bed, his glasses on, reading... "d.h. lawrence"... we see he's squinting... we see his point of view, the print, is blurred... he takes off the glasses, looks at the printerior.. and it's clear as a bell...}
<C>__{benjamin button's }
<D>__{i didn't need glasses anymore...}
<A>__{and we see benjamin, naked, standing in front of a full length mirror, looking at himself, studying himself....}
<D>__{benjamin button's (v.0.) (cont'd) my hair had very little gray and grew like weeds... benjamin button's (v.0.) (cont'd) my sense of smell was keener... my hearing more acute... i could walk further and faster...}
<A>__{he can see outside an ambulance has arrived... to take away another of the old people...}
<D>__{benjamin button's (v.o.) (cont'd) while everybody else was aging... i was getting younger... all alone...}
<A>__{and as he quietly looks at himself... there's a knock on the door..}
<C>__{a man's }
<D>__{benjamin...}
<A>__{he puts something on, and opens the door. and as if to underscore what he's just said, he sees thomas button in his fifties himself now, leaning on crutches, his feet bandaged, standing in the doorway...}
<C>__{thomas button}
<D>__{hello, benjamin... do you remember me?}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{of course, mr. button... what happened to you?}
<C>__{thomas button}
<D>__{my foot was infected... i'm afraid they had to remove it...}
<P>__{(beat, without irony)}
<D>__{welcome home, my friend.}
