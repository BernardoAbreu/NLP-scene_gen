<L>__{int railway station day}
<A>__{ada walking as briskly as a woman can walk without running and then her walk becomes a panic running, looking, sweating, and the look on her face is evident that she is frightened and close to shock... she gets to a train gate where she sees the s.s. men pushing men through the gate to the train... she knows she is where she has to be... she approaches one of the s.s. men...}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{excuse me, sir, but i wonder if you would help me... you see...}
<C>__{s.s. man}
<P>__{(very briskly)}
<D>__{no! go away!}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{you don't understand...}
<C>__{s.s. man}
<D>__{you don't understand... i said go away !!}
<A>__{ada backs away from the gate, and stands to one side watching the prisoners being moved from the back of the huge truck backed up to the railway area... she is looking through the iron bars (we shoot the bars holding depth of field snugly so that the prisoners and the bars are in sharp focus)... we make quick cuts between ada and the prisoners exiting the huge truck... as we see the change of expression on ada's face we know she sees what she's been looking for... helmut... he is walking in a slow rhythm following a group of men who look equally as broken and sad as he looks... ada yells through the bars...}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{helmut !}
<A>__{just as she yells, the voice of an s.s. man drowns out her scream as he yells...}
<C>__{s.s. man}
<D>__{move along... you swine... move... we haven't got all day... move... move... one two three four }
<A>__{his voice rings loudly in echo in the vast station it's as though he is timing his yells to each scream of hers... we see her mouth moving with the sound of the s.s. man's voice coming from it... she is screaming helmut... as the s.s. man screams...}
<C>__{s.s. man}
<D>__{move it... move it... move... move... hurry... faster... faster...}
<A>__{helmut and the other men push ahead faster and faster... with intercuts of ada, tears streaming down her face... with cuts of helmut walking with his head down, embarrassed and shattered... med. ada we move the camera slowly towards her, peering through the bars of the huge gate... and as we move, we hear the doors of the train slamming... the whistle... and the slow start of the locomotive moving the train out of the station... by the time we get to the (choker) of ada... the train is almost out of listening range... she drops her head, wipes her eyes with her handkerchief, as we hear so.:}
<C>__{s.s. man}
<P>__{(the same one at the}
<D>__{gate who told her to}
<P>__{go away)}
<D>__{now i would be glad to help you, fraulein... shall we start with a drink? there is a lovely little bar around the corner...}
<A>__{during the above dialogue we see another s.s. man closing and locking the gate to the train platform... she looks at this "pig", then down and up as though she were examining a rare, never seen insect... and then right into his face... and softly whispers:}

<D>__{go away !!}
