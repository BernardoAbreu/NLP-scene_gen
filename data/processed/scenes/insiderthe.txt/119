<L>__{interior the conference room, cbs day}
<A>__{we're at a table. mike and lowell laugh at some joke while helen caperelli, cbs general counsel, enters with the president of cbs news, eric kluster.}
<C>__{helen caperelli}
<D>__{shall i send for coffee? sorry i'm late.}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{no, no, we're fine...}
<C>__{helen caperelli}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<A>__{also there is don hewitt. caperelli is too well put together, too practiced, too polished. they nod. they don't need coffee.}
<C>__{helen caperelli }
<D>__{alright, i thought we'd get together because there's a legal concept that has been getting some new attention recently, "tortious interference."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{if two people have an agreement, like a confidentiality agreement, and one of them breaks it because they are induced to do so by a 3rd party, the 3rd party can be sued for damages for interfering...hence, "tortious interference."}
<C>__{don hewitt}
<D>__{interfering? that's what we do.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{i think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. this is a news organization. people are always telling us things they shouldn't. we have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... and if it is, we air it.}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{after we corroborate it. that's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.}
<P>__{(impatient, now)}
<D>__{anything else? helen caperelli and}
<A>__{"60 minutes'" verification is exact. and precise. and i don't think it would}
<D>__{hurt to make sure}
<A>__{you're right...on this}
<D>__{one.}
<C>__{don hewitt}
<D>__{why? you think we have liability? what's the cbs news' position, eric?}
<C>__{eric kluster}
<D>__{there's a possibility, it's rather remote...}
<C>__{helen caperelli}
<D>__{but one we have to check on, mike. i've retained outside counsel to do exactly that. on a segment, i might add, that's already rife with problems...}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{what does that mean? "rife with ?"}
<C>__{helen caperelli}
<D>__{i'm told unusual promises were made to wigand.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{no, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...}
<C>__{helen caperelli}
<P>__{(cuts in)}
<D>__{and, i'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.}
<C>__{lowell}
<P>__{(trying to control his anger)}
<D>__{his "veracity" was good enough for the state of mississippi.}
<C>__{helen caperelli}
<P>__{(historic)}
<D>__{our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are}
<A>__{the}
<D>__{standard... for}
<A>__{everyone else... whatever that means...}
<C>__{lowell}
<P>__{(wry)}
<D>__{well, as a "standard"...i will hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"}
<C>__{helen caperelli}
<D>__{well, with tortious interference, i'm afraid...the greater the truth, the greater the damage.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{come again?}
<C>__{helen caperelli}
<D>__{they own}
<A>__{the information he's disclosing.}
<D>__{the truer it is, the greater the damage to them. if he lied, he didn't disclose their}
<A>__{information. and the damages are}
<D>__{smaller.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{is this "alice in wonderland"?}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{you said "on this one." what about "this one"?}
<A>__{and lowell hears a changed note in wallace's voice. after a beat.}
<C>__{helen caperelli}
<P>__{(familiar, seductive)}
<D>__{if this holds up, and it very well may not, mike...but, if it did. and we aired this segment? and cbs was sued by brown & williamson? i think we could be at grave risk.}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{how grace?}
<C>__{helen caperelli}
<P>__{(and she's been waiting for this)}
<D>__{well, at the end of the day...because of your segment...the brown & williamson tobacco company...could own}
<B>__{cbs.}
<A>__{as if on cue, the alarm on helen caperelli's watch beeps. she glances at it.}
<C>__{helen caperelli }
<D>__{you know, i am sorry. but i'm due upstairs.}
<A>__{she gets up, gathering her things.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{is cbs corporate telling cbs news do not go to air with this story?}
<C>__{helen caperelli}
<D>__{you're getting ahead of yourself. we're all}
<A>__{in this together. we're all}
<B>__{cbs.}
<D>__{we'll find out soon. thank you, gentlemen.}
<A>__{and taking up her briefcase, she leaves. don and mike rise.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{"tortious interference"? sounds like a disease caught by a radio.}
<C>__{don hewitt}
<P>__{(to mike)}
<D>__{lunch?}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{sure.}
<P>__{(to lowell)}
<D>__{don't worry, we call the shots around here.}
<A>__{lowell finds himself angry and alone. he crosses to the window and pulls out his cell phone and goes to work.}
<C>__{debbie deluca's voice }
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{lowell}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{debbie, it's me. i want you to check some filings and give me john wilson's number at bear stern.}
