<L>__{exterior gotham park late afternoon}
<A>__{the weekend long birthday gala is getting underway, and gotham park is mobbed with celebrants enjoying a free concert. onstage: five elvis imitators, dressed in everything from black leather to white spangled jumpsuits, representing the king in progressive stages of deterioration.}
<L>__{interior vicki's apartment dusk}
<A>__{she's on the sofa beside a disconsolate bruce.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{... so we just pretend none of this ever happened. we never met. we }
<P>__{(frightened)}
<D>__{you're going to get yourself killed, bruce. you know that, don't you?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{it wouldn't matter much.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{i don't understand it. you can do so much good for people. as bruce wayne.}
<A>__{he sinks back on the sofa, closes his eyes. he's had the same argument with himself a thousand times.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{money makes money, vicki. the foundation runs itself. i'm extraneous to the process.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{you're one man. you can't save everybody.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{what it i could save a handful? what if i could save one?}
<A>__{vicki is sick of watching bruce torment himself. she stands up, almost crying now, and accuses him directly:}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(staring right at her)}
<D>__{sometimes... i don't know if there's enough of me left to save.}
<A>__{vicki is totally drained. she heads for the kitchen.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{oh, god. i've got to have some coffee or something.}
<A>__{a moment's breather as bruce sits on the sofa reflecting. then, suddenly, a knock at the door. vicki reappears and moves to answer the door. bruce on his feet instantly grabs her by the shoulder.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{are you expecting anyone?}
<A>__{she nods no. he goes to the peephole in the door.}
<C>__{bruce }
<D>__{who's there?}
<A>__{through the peephole he sees a delivery boy.}
<C>__{delivery boy}
<D>__{package tor miss vale.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{set it down by the door. on the left hand side.}
<A>__{the delivery boy sets the package down and wanders off, tipless, muttering something about "cheap shits." after a moment's interval, bruce opens the door and bends to pick up the mysterious package. another brown paper parcel... addressed in crayon.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{bruce!}
<A>__{he strides past her, handling the parcel gingerly, and sets it down on the kitchen counter.}
<C>__{vicki }
<D>__{it's just like the last time. he sent me a present before he }
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{very thoughtful. don't touch it.}
<A>__{as vicki watches, he goes into the living room and finds his alligator attache case. he opens the case, removes a laptop computer and a handful of business papers... then lifts out a false bottom to reveal his utility belt.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{oh, bruce. don't tell me you carry it around with you.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i feel naked without it.}
<A>__{he takes out a tiny ultrasound scanner rather like a stethoscope, with a miniature sonar display where the earpieces should be and runs it over the package.}
<C>__{bruce }
<D>__{not a bomb. but it could be rigged. wait in the next room.}
<A>__{he takes a small gas mask from his belt, puts it on, then slits the wrapping with a steak knife. nothing. cautiously, he pulls back the flaps. the box is full of styrofoam popcorn. bruce shoves a hand down into the popcorn... and extracts a human ear. in the doorway behind him, vicki lets out a squeal. bruce grabs the box and dumps two dozen ears on the counter.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{... they're wax.}
<A>__{vicki finds a hand scrawled note among the ears.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{"it worked for van gogh. let's make up. i will need you soon." whew.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(lost in thought)}
<D>__{that does it. it's going to be this weekend.}
<A>__{the kitchen phone rings. vicki reaches for the receiver. her eyes go wide and she gestures him over.}
