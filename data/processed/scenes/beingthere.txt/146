<L>__{interior large auditorium day}
<A>__{ah auditorium with row upon row of empty seats. huddled together at one end of the hall are six important businessmen, speaking in hushed tones. james dudley, a powerful industrialist, speaks.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{but what do we know of the man? nothing! we have no inkling of his past!}
<A>__{sewell nelson, a corporation chairman, joins in.}
<C>__{nelson}
<D>__{correct, and that is an asset. a man's past can cripple him, his background turns into a swamp and invites scrutiny.}
<A>__{another executive, peter caldwell, agrees.}
<C>__{caldwell}
<D>__{to this time, he hasn't said anything that could be used against him.}
<A>__{charlie bob bennet, a texas oil millionaire;}
<C>__{bennet}
<D>__{well, i'm certainly open to the thought it would be sheer lunacy to support the president for another term.}
<C>__{nelson}
<D>__{no one will go along with that... look at the facts, gentlemen, the response from his appearance on 'this evening' was overwhelming; he has excited and awakened the people of this country at a time of despair.}
<A>__{lyman murray, a banker;}
<C>__{murray}
<D>__{he's personable, elusive, yet seemingly honest. he's riding a crest of popularity that builds with every statement. as far as his thinking goes, he appears to be one of us. i firmly believe, gentlemen, that he is our only chance mr. chauncey gardiner!}
