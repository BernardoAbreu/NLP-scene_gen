<L>__{interior club}
<A>__{rita has succeeded in recapturing sidney near the entrance to the club. sidney, alert and interested, listens to her while keeping his eye on the bandstand in b.g. where the intermission pianist is finishing his performance and the quintet are returning, ready to mount the bandstand again.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{don't tell me you started a polka with leo bartha?}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{no. that's what i mean i'm being fired for what i didn't do.}
<A>__{sidney is amused. rita continues in a confidential manner which is heavily loaded with sex appeal and not very convincing air of injury.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(soto voce)}
<D>__{he came in last week on a very dull rainy night. i know who he was, but i didn't let on.}
<P>__{(emphatically)}
<D>__{he didn't take his eyes off me all night. listening...?}
<A>__{rita has mistaken sidney's shrewdly calculating expression for inattention.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{avidly. he was staring.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{staring. consequently, when he approached me on his way out i wasn't surprised, but i didn't let on.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(prompting)}
<D>__{he was writing a special sunday piece on...?}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{...cigarette girls... and naturally }
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you were thrilled to be interviewed.}
<P>__{(she nods)}
<D>__{were you "interviewed"?}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{in his apartment }
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{and where was his wife?}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{i don't know it's a big apartment. but i wasn't interviewed. in fact, i was totally unprepared for what happened.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(grimacing)}
<D>__{we're old friends, chickie quit it! a big columnist comes in this room, without his ball and chain and you make like a delicatessen counter! what did you think would happen in his house?}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(with a nod)}
<D>__{but, sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!}
<A>__{despite himself, sidney chuckles; but she is distressed.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{for a moment i was so taken aback that i said anything that popped into my sleepy head. if i'm not mistaken, i even ordered the man out of his own house.}
<A>__{sidney's eyes have been caught by something at the other end of the big room.}
<B>__{steve and susan}
<A>__{from sidney's viewpointerior susan has come back into the club with steve and seems to be taking leave of him. she starts to walk through the club on her way out.}
<B>__{resume sidney and rita}
<A>__{sidney, with half his attention on susan and steve, listens to rita's rueful protest.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(rapidly)}
<D>__{he was furious and, by the time i could have put on a tropical island mood, i was out on the street!...}
<P>__{(dolefully)}
<D>__{that night mr. van cleve calls me into his office here. he's got nothing against me, he says but he can't afford to antagonize columnists. i told him i still have sonny at military academy, but van cleve's made of ice...}
<A>__{aware that sidney is moving to leave her so that he can catch susan, rita detains him with an appeal:}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(tentative)}
<D>__{do you think you could do something, sidney?}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(a quick nod)}
<D>__{that's what i'm thinking, rita. maybe...}
<A>__{rita is anxious to cement the offer. delicately, she asks:}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{do you still keep your key under the mat?}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(eyeing her)}
<D>__{can you be there by two thirty?}
<A>__{she drops her eyes, nods. sidney pats her arm and is gone. she looks after him.}
<B>__{sidney and susan}
<A>__{sidney overtakes susan at the front entrance in time to open the door for her. he has now reverted to another mood in which he appears to be sulking over the insult delivered to him by steve. he goes out ahead of her.}
<B>__{bandstand}
<A>__{the quintet are resuming their positions on the stand. steve lingers a moment, his guitar already in his hand while he talks to d'angelo.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{frank, i don't want any secrets from you. i proposed to susie tonight.}
<A>__{d'angelo hides his feelings, asks:}
<C>__{d'angelo}
<D>__{did she accept?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you don't like it, do you. i think she will accept, but i'm not sure. she may be too dependent on her brother.}
<A>__{he mounts the bandstand.}
<C>__{d'angelo}
<P>__{(solemnly)}
<D>__{lots of good people in this town are dependent on her brother...}
<A>__{steve sits on the stool, quietly gives the beat to his group and begins at once the guitar opening of a very simple and lonely melody. (the sage.)}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{while d'angelo watches him, the boy continues. camera tracks slowly back through the club as the chatter and babble of the customers begins to diminish in appreciation of the quiet melancholy of the music.}
<B>__{outside the elysian room}
<A>__{susan is standing beside the poster which features steve, listening to the music from inside the club. sidney comes to join her. he is now pretending to be hurt.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you're touchy, sidney don't be so touchy...}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(gruffly)}
<D>__{i wasn't looking for a brawl. i came to bring him a present.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{wanna bite to eat?}
<A>__{susan shakes her head. she looks up as she hears the doorman's whistle off screen. sidney moves forward to escort her to the taxi.}
<B>__{longer shot}
<A>__{they cross the sidewalk and get into the cab. it starts off and camera pans with it.}
<B>__{inside cab}
<A>__{susan is relaxed, content but thoughtful. sidney flicks her a quick, anxious look. finally, gloomily:}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{feels like a monday night, don't it...?}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{not to me. sometimes, the world feels like a cage. then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never monday night again...}
<P>__{(turning to sidney)}
<D>__{i wish you and steve could like each other.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(grimacing)}
<D>__{we stick in each others craw.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{yes, but why?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{well, for one thing, he thinks j.j. is some kind of monster.}
<B>__{susan}
<A>__{quizzically, she studies sidney.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{don't you?}
<B>__{sidney}
<A>__{he looks up sharply, (he is momentarily startled at susan's insight.) swiftly, he assumes a protesting air.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{susie, your brother's one of my best friends, and }
<B>__{resume susan}
<A>__{she is not totally convinced by this performance. she smiles skeptically.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i know. but someday i'd like to look into your clever mind and see what you really think of him }
<B>__{resume sidney and susan}
<A>__{sidney makes a show of indignation.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{where do you come off to make a remark like that?}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?}
<A>__{sidney doesn't immediately answer. susan drops her eyes, becoming absorbed in her own problems. cautiously, sidney lets the momentary silence continue. then:}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{do you think j.j. likes steve...?}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(glibly)}
<D>__{frankly, yes, to my surprise. he thinks he's very gifted those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.}
<A>__{susan says nothing. sidney, watching her closely, probes further:}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{you feel pretty strong about this boy?}
<A>__{a pause. then susan nods. she is not looking at sidney and cannot see the watchfulness in his face. sidney prompts again:}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{wedding bells, you mean?}
<A>__{again susan nods.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{he wants me to go on the road with them. it's an eight month tour, all the way to oregon...}
<B>__{sidney}
<A>__{the news has considerable impact on him. but he hides it, saying lightly:}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{well, congratulations. but don't go just for the ride! or didn't you accept the proposal?}
<B>__{resume susan and sidney}
<A>__{susan continues.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i'm going to discuss it with j.j. in the morning.}
<A>__{a pause. each is concerned with private thoughts. susan, relaxed, adds quietly:}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{it's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because i'm my brother's sister.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{chickie, i will have to laugh at that an attractive girl like you...!}
<A>__{susan ignores his remark, continuing thoughtfully:}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i hope that j.j. really likes steve, that it isn't an act.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(with an indignant edge)}
<D>__{why should he put on an act? your brother has told presidents where to go and what to do!}
<A>__{the taxi has pulled to a stop. susan sits for a moment before she remarks.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{the act would be for my sake, not steve's...}
<A>__{realizing that they have come to their destination, susan gets up, moving out of camera as she disembarks from the taxi. camera catches a glimpse of apprehension in sidney's eyes. quickly, he decides to follow her.}
