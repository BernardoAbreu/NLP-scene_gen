<L>__{interior hall of the north american mammals night}
<A>__{pendergast remains at the window watching anxiously. from the south entrance to the planetarium, an enormous dark shape slinks into view! pendergast steps back from the doorway, turns to margo.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{hide quickly!}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{what are you going to do?}
<A>__{pendergast checks his gun, totally calm.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{buy them some time.}
<A>__{margo turns and looks around at the looming dioramas. there's a plain door at their end of the hall. pendergast faces the broken window. his pov... the beast is slinking away after d'agosta and the others, headed to the north exit from the planetarium! pendergast calls out...}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{hey you big tub of lard! over here!}
<A>__{the beast pauses, turns. pendergast puts his palms up at his ears, wiggles his fingers and makes a face through the window.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{come on, you smelly pile of refuse. come get me. i dare you!}
<A>__{a low surprised growl comes from the beast. it crouches as if to pounce. pendergast makes more faces, sticks his tongue out. the beast watches in silence, its evil eyes fixed. on margo... watching pendergast. she can't leave him yet.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{what is it doing?}
<C>__{pendergast}
<P>__{(loud)}
<D>__{it's scared of me.}
<A>__{suddenly there's a crash and the door bends like cardboard. two huge sets of claws lash through! margo screams as the claws pass inches from pendergast's face. he leaps back, lifts his gun which looks like a pea shooter in the face of mbwun. two sets of claws curve around the bent edges of the door, then mbwun simply lifts it out of the frame. this leaves pendergast face to face with the foul, enormous monster! it regards him evenly, blinks once. then the tongue slides out, licks its lips eagerly and... pendergast flicks on his high powered flashlight, shining it at close range right in the beast's eyes! then carefully, with total calm he fires once, twice. the beast howls more in anger than pain, rears up and swipes at pendergast. pendergast dives to one side and, the claws miss again by inches as the beast is temporarily blinded by the light. now pendergast spins and runs for all he's worth. margo's been waiting, holding the door.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{drop the fibers!}
<A>__{she leaves the crate behind as pendergast dives inside with her. margo shoves the door shut hard as mbwun, still blinded, leaps into the hall. but now, suddenly, all is quiet. no sign of margo and pendergast. the beast moves forward, snuffling slowly. it starts for the door which hides margo and pendergast, but stops as it finds... the crate! the beast moves to it, clearly surprised. it pokes at the crate carefully, inhales the fragrance and grunts. the monster seems to be struggling with itself! it sniffs the fibers, lifts a few out carefully, then shoves the crate away hard. then it rises on its haunches and squints into the dark. on all sides are glowing displays of stuffed buffalo, gazelle, wild horses, wolves, giant elk, sabre tooth tigers. mbwun moves close to one after another. suddenly we notice, in the back of one of the dioramas... margo and pendergast! they stand frozen, crouching behind mannequins of native americans riding horses across the plains. the beast sniffs right at their window, then turns away. confused, it heads back towards the planetarium and slinks from the room. inside the diorama... pendergast and margo exchange an astonished look. they whisper.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{its eyesight is worse than i thought. it couldn't see us. and it couldn't smell us through the glass.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{it didn't want the fibers. what does that mean?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i think... it means it's full.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{then it won't go after the others?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{no. it's still hunting, but not for the hormones.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i think... for the pleasure of the kill.}
