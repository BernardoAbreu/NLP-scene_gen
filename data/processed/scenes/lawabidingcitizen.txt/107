<C>__{iger}
<D>__{you'll have it all to yourself the first man down there in over twenty years. quite an achievement.}
<A>__{clyde sinks with a sigh of resignation and defeat, rests his head wearily on the bars. nick moves in, speaking quietly:}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you're doing everything wrong. making all the wrong moves.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{it would seem that way.}
<A>__{the wording catches nick but he dismisses it, turns:}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{sam. i know you got hit hard. i know you're furious. but i'd like my shot at prosecuting this case.}

<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{wake up, blind man! it's been exactly that since i watched him shake clarence darby's hand on the steps of the hall of justice ten years ago! the hall of justice!}

<C>__{davies}
<D>__{you wanna take this fuck down? be my guest. whatever you need.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(bangs his bars)}
<D>__{that's the spirit, yes!}
