<A>__{silence. hold it for five seconds and then}
<B>__{a blur}
<A>__{eyelids fluttering, bright light, at first broken up, filtered, as if viewed through a kaleidoscope. slowly shapes and impressions begin to form and we know where we are. it's the infirmary.}
<L>__{interior infirmary day}
<A>__{a clean shaven and drugged up sam is sitting up in bed, propped with a pillow. sam doesn't have a scratch on his face, but has clearly been through a terrifying ordeal. gerty is bedside.}

<D>__{where am i?}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{sam, you're in the infirmary. you had an accident.}

<D>__{do you remember what happened?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i don't remember a thing.}

<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{that's good. that's very good. it's nice to see you awake again.}
<P>__{(a beat)}

<D>__{how long have i been out?}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{not long. sam, go back to sleep. you're still very tired. we can talk later.}
<A>__{sam closes his eyes, sinking deeper into his pillow.}
