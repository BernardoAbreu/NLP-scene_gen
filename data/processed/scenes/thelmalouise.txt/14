<L>__{exterior thelma's house day}
<A>__{louise's green '66 t bird convertible pulls into the driveway of thelma's house. the garage door goes up and thelma is standing in the garage with all her gear. a suitcase that looks like it might explode, fishing gear, a cooler, a lantern. thelma's car, a beat up gray honda, is parked in there, too. louise gets out of the driver's seat.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{we don't need the lantern. the place has electricity.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i wanna take it anyway. just in case.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{in case of what?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{in case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.}
<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(going along with her)}
<D>__{oh yeah, sure, thelma, that lantern will come in real handy. maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{we'd have to. that thing barely makes it down the driveway.}
<A>__{they load everything into the car. the trunk barely closes. thelma heaves all her weight against it. they get into the car and pull out of the driveway. as they drive down the street, we hear thelma let out a long howl. she is laughing and she sticks her arms straight up in the air.}
