<A>__{evan unlocks the door and is moved by what he sees. lenny is strapped onto a metal bed, his arms and legs in tight leather restraints. the dark five o'clock shadow and his malicious grin radiate evil. his black and haunting eyes personify hate and murderous intent. lenny seems neither surprised or happy to see evan. that is, if he's aware of evan's presence at all...}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{is there anything you need? anything i can get you?}
<A>__{nothing from lenny.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{what about the models, man? bet i can get you a shitload of models up in here.}
<A>__{still nothing. not even a glance in his direction. evan sighs and gives up.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{okay, lenny. just wanted to say "hi".}
<A>__{evan turns around to leave.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{you knew the whole time, didn't you?}
<P>__{(evan spins around)}
<D>__{when you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. didn't you?!}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(jaw dropped)}
<D>__{y... yes. i guess i did.}
<A>__{lenny's eyes seethe with hate.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{then you should be where i am. you should be where i am.}
<A>__{evan backs away, face guilt stricken.}
