<L>__{interior dr. becker's office, alpine grove, day}
<A>__{starks sits opposite dr. becker in a harsh, tiled office. starks wears his blue uniform and becker wears a doubtful expression. from starks' p.o.v.: the drugs they've already started giving him blur his vision of becker.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{william? william, can you hear me?}
<A>__{starks nods groggily.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{i've given you some drugs to help with your adjustment... starks [cutting him off] what kind of drugs? [beat] 'cause these seem pretty...pretty serious.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{well, your condition's pretty serious.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{[beat] so they say. [off becker's steady gaze] what?}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{i'm just looking at you. does that make you uncomfortable?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{depends on what you're seeing.}
<A>__{becker eyes starks mistrustfully.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{you said you couldn't remember killing officer harrison. correct?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{[beat] you don't believe me, do you?}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{it's not my job to believe you. starks [squinting to better see] you're a doctor. i would think... becker [cutting him off firmly] it's not my job to believe you or to understand you. it's my job to try to cure you and if that's a no go, then to...take some kind of care of you. starks [flatly] lucky me.}
<A>__{becker looks at starks his eyes casting shame upon the alleged murderer that sits before him.}
<D>__{becker [stupefied] you shot a man three times: first in his heart, then in his stomach and then...point blank, in the back of his head. and then you just...forgot all about it. a whole life erased with three easy little words: i. don't. know. what would it be if we could all not know what we didn't want to have to face.}
<A>__{becker glances at his watch and gets up still blurred in starks' p.o.v. it's only as he's walking off that starks notices he has a limp.}
