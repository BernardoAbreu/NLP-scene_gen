<A>__{sizette and chris with the family at dinner. suzette is passed the rand daily mail newspaper by chris, folded at an article headlined: "what really happened to jonathan ngubene?" by melanie bruwer.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{isn't that tragic? jonathan was such a nice boy. even played with my johan when they were small, god.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{and he was such a nice boy, well mannered.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you said he was very bright at school.}
<A>__{chris helps himself to more. suzette looks at the paper.}
<C>__{suzette}
<D>__{well, this kind of journalism doesn't help the situation. look at her face? what does she look like?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{the rand daily mail always exaggerates.}
<A>__{she passes the paper to ben. he looks at melanie's pic ture: she looks 30 years old, long black hair, large dark eyes with a fierce, unsettling, uncompromising stare, a small nose and a generous and sensual mouth.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{looks quite attractive to me.}
<A>__{chris and johan laugh.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(he surveys the}
<D>__{article; then with}
<P>__{a serious tone)}
<D>__{'... is only the latest in scores of black youths who have disappeared whilst in police custody.'}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{what does she expect? they're out of control. give then an inch and they take a hundred miles. it's in their nature. the only language they understand is force.}
<C>__{johan}
<D>__{chris, jonathan was fifteen, like me. would you use force on me?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{you're not a terrorist. if you were like an increasing number of them, you'd deserve it. look, every time you pick up the newspaper...}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(interrupts; focusing on the paper)}
<D>__{my god, one hundred shot! they didn't have to kill them.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{this bloody bruwer woman reports one hundred shot, but the radio said only twenty and the police were attacked first.}
<C>__{suzette}
<D>__{i thought the idea was to give them their own areas, banstustans. let them live with their own kind. no chance of conflict then. everybody's happy.}
<C>__{johan}
<D>__{and who would do the work?}
<C>__{suzette}
<D>__{pardon?}
<C>__{johan}
<D>__{the work, who'd do it?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you for a start. come on! help me clear these dishes.}
<A>__{as johan stands, to clear the table. he turns to his father with a smile, and shrugs an irritated suzette joins them.}
