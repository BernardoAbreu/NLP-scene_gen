<L>__{interior limo day}
<A>__{lloyd is driving and mary is in the back, looking out the window, lost in thought. she's got a briefcase resting on her lap and she fingers the leather nervously. lloyd keeps glancing at her in the rear view mirror, but for a moment he is speechless. then:}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{why you going to the airport? flying somewhere?}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(dead pan)}
<D>__{how'd you guess?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{well, i saw your luggage, then when i noticed the airline ticket, i put two and two together.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so where you heading?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{aspen.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{oh, you're gonna love it. i hear california's beautiful this time of year.}
<A>__{mary looks back out the window and lloyd sneaks another glance.}
<C>__{lloyd }
<D>__{name's christmas. lloyd christmas.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i'm mary.}
<A>__{on lloyd we can almost see his mind work. he's desperate to impress her.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{uh, this isn't my real job, you know. it's only temporary.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{oh?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{yeah, you see, my friend harry and i are saving up our money so we can open our own pet store.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{that's nice.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i got worms.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{that's what we're gonna call it: i got worms. we're gonna specialize in selling worm farms you know, like ant farms. a lot of people don't realize that worms make much better pets than ants. they're quiet, affectionate, they don't bite, and they're super with the kids.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{aren't ants quiet, too?}
<A>__{lloyd realizes she has a pointerior}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{uh... well, sure but they aren't half as affectionate. and if you cut an ant's head off, it won't grow back.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{and best of all, worm farming is a seventy five thousand dollar a year industry. i wouldn't mind having a piece of that pie, if you know what i mean.}
<A>__{to her credit, she doesn't. they continue driving. mary looks at her watch and crosses her legs. lloyd can see that she's concerned about something.}
<C>__{lloyd }
<D>__{what's the matter? little tense about the flight?}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{something like that.}
<A>__{lloyd swivels around and stares over his shoulder at her.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{it's really nothing to worry about, mary. statistically, they say you're more likely to get killed on the way to the airport. you know, like in a head on crash, or something.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{um, lloyd, could please keep your eyes on the road.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{good thinking. there's a lot of bad rivers out there.}
<A>__{lloyd turns back to the steering wheel.}
