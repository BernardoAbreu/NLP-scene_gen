<L>__{interior logue's study new day}
<A>__{bertie stands shattered, lost in his painful memory.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i couldn't say anything!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{you could've refused. don't you know any rude words?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{what a bloody stupid question! i just said one. bloody. bloodybloodybloody!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{perhaps a touch more vulgar?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{certainly not.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{to prove you know how.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{bugger!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{a public school prig could do better.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{well bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{hardly robust.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{shit then. shit, shit, shit!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{see how defecation flows trippingly from the tongue? you don't stutter when you swear.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{because i'm angry!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{get angry more often. do you know the f word?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{fornication?}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{oh bertie...}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{fuck. fuck, fuck, fuck!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{bravissimo! now a resounding chorus of...}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{bloody, bloody. bloody! shit, shit, shit! bugger, bugger, bugger! fuck, fuck, fuck!}
<A>__{a pounding on the wall.}
<C>__{myrtle }
<D>__{we have children...!}
<C>__{bertie}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{this is your fault!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{sorry, pet! won't happen again!}
<C>__{myrtle }
<D>__{i should hope not!}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{apologies, mrs. logue.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{first time i've heard you laugh.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{royals aren't allowed emotions in public.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{which explains a lot.}
<A>__{bertie is in no mood to be provoked.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{what do you want me to do, dammit!? stage my next public appearance as an obscene operetta?!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{your next public appearance should be very well rehearsed.}
<A>__{without thinking, lionel instinctively reaches out to pat bertie supportively on the shoulder. bertie pulls back in offended shock. all the warning signals instilled in him are going off.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{don't take liberties! you're a dangerous man, logue. who sent you?}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{anyone in mind?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{the lurking shadows. courtiers and peers...the whole panoply of a class which once ruled the nation which once ruled the world, afraid of losing their last vestige of privilege if the monarchy is further debased.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{your wife was the one who sought me out.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{because, dear sweet deluded woman, she believes in me!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{but you don't share her belief? why come here?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i'm beginning to ask myself that very same question. your sailing close to the edge, don't push me, doctor logue.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{lionel.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i came here because i was taught from childhood to serve a purpose, and that purpose is to serve. duty is our sole justification for privilege.}
<C>__{bertie }
<D>__{i came here because i was under the illusion you might help me perform that function!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{not to worry. they say the king can do no wrong.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{he can bugger things up! and i am not the king. mrs. simpson is seeking a divorce. the coronation is set for the 12th of may. her decree becomes final on the 27th of april. that gives them two weeks to marry and put this issue to rest.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{and if mr baldwin stops them?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{that would be a tragedy. i pray to the almighty they succeed. i will do anything within my power to keep my brother on the throne.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{does that include debasing yourself?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{if necessary!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{your brother knew perfectly well by giving you a document without warning...}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{are you saying he wanted me to fail?}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{are you insisting he didn't? in the future we can parse any document into manageable phrases. you can sing them, swear them, rehearse them til you get the rhythm and flow; that, combined with your growing confidence...}
<A>__{bertie doesn't want to hear.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{growing confidence? growing dread!!! you're a wicked man, lionel logue, trying to get me to thrust myself forward as an alternative to my brother. trying to get me to commit treason!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{trying to get you to realize you need not be governed by fear. again, why did you seek me out? to take polite elocution lessons so you could attend posh tea parties?!}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{how dare you! i'm the brother of a king...the son of a king...back through untold centuries. you presume to instruct me on my duty? a jumped up jackeroo from the outback? the disappointing son of an embittered clerk! you're a monster, doctor logue. i'm going to balmoral to spend a pleasant country weekend with my beloved brother. and these sessions are over!}
