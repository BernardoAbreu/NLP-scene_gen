<A>__{anne reaches the door, and finds a few nuns and an old priest praying in the little chapel. she staggers forward to the altar. and falls to her knees there. the nuns and the old priest, seeing the queen mother so distraught, stand silently and file out, leaving her in solitude.}

<D>__{oh god i forgive me...}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{m'lady...?}
<A>__{she whirls to see him; the sight of her face, bursting with emotions she has kept buried, draws him nearer.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{what ?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{no, stay back! stay back!}
<A>__{he freezes in his tracks; she holds her hands out toward him as if warding off a blow. he's desperate to move to her; she sees it on his face.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{d'artagnan!}
<A>__{her emotions break all her resolve to keep him away; she rushes into his arms. they clutch each other, in an embrace they have denied for many years. they kiss hungrily.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{m'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{if i don't kiss you, i die anyway.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i can't bear to see you cry. what is wrong?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{nothing... nothing.}
<A>__{she draws back; he tries to hold her. but the thoughts of answering that question makes her stiffen.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{nothing. this... didn't happen. i must go back now.}
<A>__{and just like that, their moment is gone.}
