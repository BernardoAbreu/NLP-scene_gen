<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{samantha(29) stands at the stovetop stirring eggs in a pan. she's still dressed in her sleeping attire, an oversized t shirt and pajama bottoms with cartoon frogs on them. hannah(5) sits at the kitchen table tearing up a piece of toast and feeding it to the dog. hannah is a blonde little girl with a large hearing aid wrapped over her right ear. it clips into her hair near the back of her head. the dog's name is red, a rhodesian ridgeback that appreciates the attention. curtis enters the kitchen and kisses hannah on the head. in the same motion, he takes the piece of toast from her hand and sets it on her plate.}
