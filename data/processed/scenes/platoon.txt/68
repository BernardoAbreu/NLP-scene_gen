<L>__{exterior village trail day}
<A>__{they come up out of the jungle onto the side of a cart trail, where a tiny village overlooks the river. the village is poor, a series of thatched hutches made of c ration cardboard and aluminum beer can sidings, faint whiffs of smoke coming from cook fires. pigs and dogs wander about. an old villager watches them pass from his tillable plot, smoking a cigarette, one leg wrapped around his hoe, resting, no expression.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{... the village, which had stood for maybe a thousand years, didn't know we were coming that day. if they had they would have run ... barnes was at the eye of our rage and through him, our captain ahab we would set things right again. that day we loved him ...}
<A>__{a pig loiters along the trail, rooting. bunny coming up on it with a smile.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{hey pig, pig come here, pig, pig.}
<A>__{the pig grunts. bunny leveling his shotgun, fires point blank. a horrible squeal. chris, directly behind him, looks disgusted.}
