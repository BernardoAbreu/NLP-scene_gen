<A>__{ramirez is there alone with maura. they are in mid argument.}
<C>__{maura}
<D>__{no! i won't let you do it! you're not going back to those subs! it's changed you... you need help, annibal. you could get some kind of stress disability or...}
<A>__{suddenly, ramirez bellows and slams his hand down on the counter.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{enough!}
<A>__{maura is shocked by the sudden violence in him.}
<C>__{maura}
<D>__{no, not enough. whatever is going on out there with your job...}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{with my job!? what do you think my job is, maura... huh? what do you think is out there? a nice, pretty safe little world with shopping malls and little league and ballet lessons. you sit here in your little kitchen and cook your little meals...}
<A>__{he looks at her almost in disgust. she sees the look and slaps him. faster than she could ever have considered, he slaps her and sends her back into the wall. she holds her cheek. he is an inch away from her face and now he is about to show her carlos, to become him in front of her.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{people are killing people out there! jackals are licking up their blood waiting for the next corpse to drop... and i'm one of them. you get that? do you get that now?!}
<A>__{he speaks very quietly, pulling the curtain aside, taking off the mask and letting her see the full horror.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{i've murdered people. not safe and clean and surgical firing a missile from some ship, but close and with my hands so their blood splattered on me... so their brains splattered on me. and they weren't the enemy, maura... they were allies. they were on our side. it was just to keep a cover... i've betrayed everything i ever believed in. i've betrayed you... i've fucked other women... i've killed men... there was a woman i would have killed but i just ran out of time. i've let friends die... i've become a terrorist... and i've made you and the children a target. do you understand what i'm saying to you? do you see me now? do you see the monster? there's another one worse than me and he is out there and he will kill you and the children if i don't kill him first... . that's my job, maura. and if you don't mind, i'm late for work.}
