<A>__{back by the desk, william is listening and laughs. that's his girl. anna prepares.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{so i ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?}

<C>__{anna}
<D>__{oh... no one... no one. just some... guy from the past. i don't know what he's doing here. bit of an awkward situation.}
