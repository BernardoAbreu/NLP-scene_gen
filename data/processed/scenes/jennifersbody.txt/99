<A>__{illuminated by lamp light, needy limps toward the gym entrance. she's completely covered in demon goo. her face is bloody, her hair is full of blood and guts, and her broken arm looks gruesome. in the background, yet another oblivious couple are making out. needy stops to stare at them, her gaze calm but obviously insane. they break apart and stare back at her.}

<D>__{what did you say?}
