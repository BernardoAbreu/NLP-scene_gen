<L>__{exterior alley}
<A>__{a non descript l.a. alley... commercial buildings on one side, walled suburb on the other. two men running all out. a recent president and a wild eyed cop trailing smoke like a crashing jet fighter. beyond the buildings behind them a fireball explodes skyward. we hear sirens and shouting, which recede as the two pelt along the alley. it gets quieter. just the machine gun slap of the shoes on pavement, and the hard breathing of the two men, each in overdrive, going all out in long blurring strides. reagan looks back. sees the demon cop behind him, gaining. utah has become an engine, a running machine... juggernaut mode. ahead of them a black and white swings into the alley. reagan hangs a hard left and blasts a wooden gate half off its hinges. utah whips through the gate a second later. diving into suburbia.}
