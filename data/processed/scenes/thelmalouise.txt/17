<L>__{exterior silver bullet night}
<A>__{they pull off at a place down on the right all lit up with neon. it's called the silver bullet. the sign flashes cocktails beer dancing food. there is a huge gravel parking lot with lots of pickup trucks and older cars. even though it's early, you can tell this place is a real night spot. it's already pretty crowded.}
<L>__{interior silver bullet night}
<A>__{this place is jumpin'. there are ten pool tables with crowds all around. the long bar is filled with customers. there are tables and booths. the room is dense with smoke. there is a dance floor, but no one is dancing yet because the band is still setting up. there are a lot of single men. many heads turn and follow thelma and louise to an empty table.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{i haven't seen a place like this since i left texas.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{isn't this fun?}
<A>__{a waitress comes over and drops two menus on the table.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{y'all wanna drink?}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i will have wild turkey straight up and a coke back, please.}
<A>__{as the waitress leaves:}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{thelma!}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{tell me somethin'. is this my vacation or isn't it? i mean, god, you're as bad as darryl.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{i just haven't seen you like this in a while. i'm used to seeing you more sedate.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{well, i've had it up to my ass with sedate! you said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!}
<A>__{as the waitress returns:}
<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{alright...}
<P>__{(to waitress)}
<D>__{i changed my mind. i will have a margarita with and a shot of cuervo on the side, please.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{yeah!}
<A>__{as the waitress leaves, a man comes over with a chair which he pulls up to the table and straddles backwards. he is in his late 40's, heavyset, his face is shiny in the neon light.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{now what are a couple of kewpie dolls like you doin' in a place like this?}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{mindin' our own business, why don't you try it.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{well, we left town for the weekend 'cause we wanted to try and have a good time. and because louise here is mad because her boyfriend won't call her while he's out on the road...}
<A>__{louise kicks thelma under the table.}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(quieter)}
<D>__{we just wanted to get somethin' to eat.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{well, you come to the right place. you like chili? they got good chili.}
<A>__{the waitress returns with louise's drink.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{harlan, are you botherin' these poor girls?}
<C>__{harlan }
<D>__{hell, no. i was just bein' friendly.}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(making eye contact with louise)}
<D>__{it's a good thing they're not all as friendly as you.}
<A>__{louise understands.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{your name's harlan? i got an uncle named harlan!}
<C>__{harlan}
<D>__{you do? is he a funny uncle? 'cause if he is, then he and i got somethin' in common.}
<A>__{harlan laughs. thelma laughs, too, but doesn't really get the joke. louise does not laugh.}
<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(to harlan)}
<D>__{i don't mean to be rude, but i've got something i need to talk to my friend about. in private.}
<C>__{harlan}
<D>__{aw, i understand. i didn't mean to bother ya. it's just hard not to notice two such pretty ladies as yourselves.}
<P>__{(standing, to thelma)}
<D>__{you better dance with me before you leave, or i will never forgive you.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{oh, sure. that'd be fun.}
<A>__{harlan leaves, then:}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{jeez, louise, that wasn't very nice.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{so what if he was? it's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{well, just relax, will ya. you're makin' me nervous.}
<A>__{thelma knocks back her shot of wild turkey and holds up her glass to the waitress to bring her another one. the waitress sees her and nods. she turns back to face her friend.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{so, jimmy still hasn't called yet?}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{givin' him a taste of his own medicine. asshole.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i'm sorry, louise. i know you're all upset. it's just i'm so excited to be out of the house, i guess.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i wonder if darryl's home yet.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{i wonder if jimmy's gotten back.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?}
<A>__{they both drift off momentarily, contemplating their domestic problems, until the waitress comes over:}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(rolling her eyes)}
<D>__{this one's on harlan.}
<A>__{thelma looks over at the bar where harlan is grinning at her, making dancing motions. she smiles and waves at him. her face becomes serious again as she turns back to louise.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{jimmy'll come in off the road, you won't be there, he'll freak out and call you a hundred thousand times, and sunday night you'll call him back and, by monday. he'll be kissin' the ground you walk on.}
<A>__{thelma's mind goes too fast for her mouth, and the speed at which she speaks can be staggering. louise is used to it. louise smiles wistfully at thelma's assessment of the situation.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{exactly.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{in the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun. so let's have some!}
<A>__{she again drinks her whole shot of wild turkey and holds up her glass, as the band strikes up a lively tune. practically the whole place "whoops" and heads for the dance floor. louise drinks her shot of tequila and holds up her glass, too.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{thelma is dancing with harlan and has been for quite a while. louise has been dancing with a quiet guy named dan. thelma is breathless, drunk and giggly. she holds a beer bottle in one hand. she is laughing a lot about nothing, and harlan is studying her closely. louise notices this.}
<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(over the noise)}
<D>__{thelma, i'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(eyes closed, swaying with the music)}
<D>__{ready when you are.}
<A>__{louise heads off to the bathroom.}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(eyes still closed)}
<D>__{louise, i'm gonna come with you.}
<P>__{(she gets a funny look on her face)}
<D>__{i don't feel so good.}
<A>__{she stumbles a step and drops her beer bottle. louise is heading towards the bathroom, where there is a line of at least fifteen women in front of her.}
<C>__{harlan}
<P>__{(catching thelma, copping feels)}
<D>__{oopsy doopsy. we need to get you some fresh air, little lady.}
<A>__{he steers her towards the door. louise leans against the wall, waiting in line.}
