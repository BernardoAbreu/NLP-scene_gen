<L>__{exterior orchards day}
<A>__{high up in a tall tree on a couple of ladders, mr. rose and homer are picking side by side. mr. rose is picking with high speed perfection, but homer is slower and fumbling he drops an occasional apple to the ground.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{you pickin' more cider apples then anythin' else. them drops is good only for cider. and you pickin' the stems with the apples only half the time. they good only for cider, too if you don't pick them stems.}
<P>__{(homer watches him)}
<D>__{the rule is, you wanna pick the apple with the stem, homer. and see here... see that bud that's just above the stem? that's the bud for next year's apple that's called the spur. you pick the spur, you pickin' two years in one you pickin' next year's apple 'fore it have a chance to grow. you leave that on the branch, you hear?}
<A>__{homer nods; he picks more carefully, with more concentration.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<P>__{(approvingly)}
<D>__{that's better. i can tell you got yourself some education. them's good hands you got, homer. them hands you got, they know what they're doin' ain't that right?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{i guess so...}
<A>__{homer can see over the apple mart parking lot from the top of the tree. he can see the driveway of the worthington house, where candy and olive are saying a tearful good bye to wally. distracted, homer drops another couple of apples, which mr. rose observes with a wry smile.}
