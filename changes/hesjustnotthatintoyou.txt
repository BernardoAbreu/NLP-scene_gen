Then, my favorite part is, I stayed with him even after he took back his proposal, and introduced the idea of a "relation vacation." Isn't that a cute name? Let me explain the concept: it involves dating a girl from the time she's thirty two to the time she's thirty nine, possibly robbing her of the ability to bear children, and then, after all that, wanting to take a year off.

At last - some intrigue, some mind games - though my sister's two year old eventually gave them up. But my last husband -- he was a gem. A veritable master at covering his tracks. I poured over his phone records, intercepted his credit card bills, had him followed on countless occasions - and never found a single shred of evidence.
