<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{we are looking at a magazine story. its headline, over an illustration of a cresting wave, is: wave of the future. underneath are black and white photographs of heavy equipment and racks of clothing on motorized tracks. subheadlines read: next to godliness dry cleaning sweeps the nation the thoroughly modern way to clean. ed sits in one of the vinyl chairs, staring at life magazine. the offscreen conversation drones on as the new man works on a customer.}
<C>__{new man}
<D>__{...go ahead, look at the menu, if you're in before six o'clock it's the, whatchamacallit, the }
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{early bird special.}
<C>__{new man}
<D>__{what? yeah, the early riser...}
<A>__{ed flips the pages of the magazine, and stops on a photograph of a dark desert landscape with one bright light hovering in the sky. the caption underneath: roswell, new mexico.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{crane?}
<A>__{ed looks up. a man in a black suit and fedora has directed the question at the new man, who looks up from his gabbling, momentarily slackjawed.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{...i'm crane.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{my name is diedrickson. county medical examiner.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{diedrickson}
<D>__{just came for an informal chat...}
<A>__{diedrickson looks around uncomfortably.}
<C>__{diedrickson}
<D>__{...why don't i buy you a drink?}
<A>__{ed rises from his chair and, as he unbuttons his smock, addresses the new man, who still gapes.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{dwight, you ok here for a few minutes?}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{whuh uh, yeah, sure ed, take your time.}
<B>__{bar}
<A>__{it is late afternoon, dusty and empty. ed and diedrickson sit on adjacent stools, diedrickson cocking his hat lower to its man sitting at a bar position. as the bartender approaches:}
<C>__{diedrickson}
<D>__{rye.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{just coffee.}
<C>__{diedrickson}
<D>__{you sure you don't want something stiffer?}
<A>__{ed shrugs and shakes his head.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{coffee it is.}
<A>__{he leaves. diedrickson interlaces his fingers on the bartop and stares at them. after a beat:}
<C>__{diedrickson}
<D>__{...county m. e. does an autopsy on anyone who dies in custody. i don't know if you knew that. it's routine.}
<A>__{ed doesn't answer. diedrickson, after some more staring at his hands, plows on:}
<C>__{diedrickson}
<D>__{...doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. however. i don't believe i'm prohibited from telling you this. i guess i'm not obliged to tell you, either. i don't exactly know. but if i were the man, i'd want to be told.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{told what?}
<C>__{diedrickson}
<D>__{i, uh... thanks.}
<A>__{the bartender has set down the drinks. diedrickson waits for him to leave. he takes a hit from his glass. finally:}
<C>__{diedrickson}
<D>__{...i'm sorry to add to your burden, crane, but i'd want to know it it was me. your wife was pregnant. first trimester.}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{diedrickson}
<D>__{...well, there it is.}
<A>__{another pause.}
<C>__{diedrickson}
<D>__{...i'm sorry.}
<A>__{he mutters to himself:}
<C>__{diedrickson}
<D>__{...hell, i hope i've done the right thing.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{my wife and i had not... performed the sex act in many years.}
<A>__{diedrickson stiffens.}
<C>__{diedrickson}
<P>__{(murmuring)}
<D>__{...jesus.}
<P>__{(aloud)}
<D>__{...well, that's not really my business.}
<A>__{he is hastily digging for money.}
<C>__{diedrickson}
<D>__{...i'm sorry. well, there it is.}
<A>__{he leaves a couple of bills on the bar and mumbles as he leaves:}
<C>__{diedrickson}
<D>__{...good luck, crane.}
<A>__{his retreating footsteps echo down the bar.}
<B>__{apartment hallway}
<A>__{it is a dingy hallway lit by bare bulbs. ed stands in the middle background, knocking on a door.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{doris and i had never really talked much. i don't think that's a bad thing, necessarily. but it was funny: now i wanted to talk now, with everyone gone. i was alone, with secrets i didn't want and no one to tell them to anyway.}
<A>__{the door opens and ed is admitted by the unseen tenant.}
<B>__{apartment}
<A>__{we hear a low murmuring as we slowly pan the apartment. it is overfurnished with heavy, ornate chairs, sideboards, chests too big for the space and all going too seed. surface areas are covered with yellowing lacework or exotic brocades; the one lamp has a veil thrown over it to further scrim down its feeble light. our pan brings us onto ed seated at a small card table across from a small elderly woman in a shawl who is the source of the murmuring. her eyes are squeezed shut in concentration as she mumbles.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{i visited a woman who was supposed to have powers in communicating with those who had passed across, as she called it. she said that people who passed across were picky about who they'd communicate with, not like most people you run into on this side...}
<A>__{the woman opens her eyes and looks at ed.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{giff me your hant.}
<A>__{ed places his hand in the center of the table.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...so you needed a guide who they didn't mind talking to, someone with a gift for talking to souls...}
<A>__{ed looks at the woman's spotted and vein lined hand as it rests upon his. her mumbling resumes.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...well, first she told me that my wife was in a peaceful place, that our souls were still connected by some spiritual bond, that she had never stopped loving me even though she'd done some things she wasn't proud of...}
<A>__{ed looks up at the old woman.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...she was reading me like a book.}
<A>__{she is stealing a glance at ed to check his reaction.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...and then she started talking about 'dolores' this and 'dolores' that and was there anything i wanted to tell 'dolores,' and i knew i'd just be telling it to the old bat. and even if somehow doris could hear, it wouldn't be on account of this so called medium.}
<B>__{apartment hallway}
<A>__{ed is leaving.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{she was a phony. just another gabber.}
