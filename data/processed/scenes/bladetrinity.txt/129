<A>__{drake in his armor, head to head with a 14th century vampire hunter. the hunter has blade's sword. drake tears the sword from the hunter's grasp, turns it around, thrusts it back through the man's chest. and as the man gasps we are }
<L>__{exterior older building rooftop day (the present)}
<A>__{ back to here and now.}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{he was honorable, in his own way. he died a good death.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{i wouldn't know about that.}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{you lie. you're part of a grand tradition, blade. you hunters have plagued my people since the day we first walked the earth. and i have vanquished them. one by one.}
<A>__{blade pauses, looking for some kind of opening.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{how can you exist in the daylight?}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{i've always been able to. haven't you read mr. stoker's fable? i was the first of the vampires. i am unique.}
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{that's why they brought you back.}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{yes. my children seek to isolate the properties in my blood that make me immune to sunlight. through me, they believe they can all become daywalkers.}
<A>__{drake glances down at the street people. throngs of people are massing there, pointing up at him.}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{the world's changed much since i went to sleep. how crowded it's become. look at them down there. lives brief as fireflies. do you think they can ever grasp what it means to be immortal like us?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{you're not immortal. i must've heard a hundred of you people make the same claim. and every one of them's seen the end of my sword.}
<A>__{drake smiles, intrigued by an obviously worthy opponent.}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{perhaps i will as well, then. but i think it's more likely that you will fall before mine.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{catch.}
<A>__{drake tosses the infant at blade. blade twists around to catch it, scooping it safely up. but when he looks back drake is gone.}
<C>__{king }
<D>__{shit!}
