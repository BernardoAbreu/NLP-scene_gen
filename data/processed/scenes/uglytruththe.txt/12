<L>__{interior restaurant dining area night}
<A>__{abby and jim sit at a table. abby looks around, tense.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you know what? this is not the best angle. we should get the table over there. then we both get a view, instead of one of us looking at the busboy station.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i'm fine here.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{no, trust me. it'll be better over there.}
<A>__{he looks at her like she's crazy, as they get up and move. antoher table moments later the waiter is now taking their drink order.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{can i get you some water for the table?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{bottle of flat, please.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you know, they've done studies that show tap water is no different from bottled water. and they passed a law recently to have all restaurants filter their tap water. so, technically it's not tap water.}
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{it's filtered water, which is exactly what bottled water is, except you don't have to pay $7 for it.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{yeah, i still like the way it tastes better.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{can i get you any cocktails?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{scotch on the rocks.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{in your profile, you said you liked red wine.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i do, i just feel like having a scotch right now.}
<A>__{she looks disappointed, then pulls out a piece of paper.}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(re the paper)}
<D>__{was there anything else you changed your mind about? i mean, just so i can figure it into the overall picture.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you printed out my profile?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{actually, my associate producer did. she likes me to be prepared. not that i'm ever not prepared. kudos on your comprehensive car insurance policy, by the way.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{that wasn't in my profile.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{no, but it was in your background check.}
<P>__{(off his look; changing the subject)}
<D>__{so...tell me about yourself.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{well, what's left that you don't know?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{good pointerior}
<A>__{there's an awkward silence between them. she pulls out another piece of paper, and hands it to him.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i printed out some talking points for us just in case this happened.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i take it it's happened before?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{no, but since you have nine out of ten of the necessary attributes on my checklist, i just wanted to make sure this goes as smoothly as possible.}
<A>__{as jim processes this, the waiter arrives with drinks.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he takes a huge sip, relieved. abby looks at him.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you realize the ice in that scotch is made from tap water, don't you?}
<A>__{he looks at her, realizing she's a complete nightmare.}
