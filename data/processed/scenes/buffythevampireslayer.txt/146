<A>__{a rustling in the trees signifies grueller's flight. seconds late, buffy roars into view behind him. she navigates the streets with less ease than determination. her eyes follow him off the road and she steers the bike on a violently bumpy and erratic course through the site. she finally hits a pile of bricks and is thrown headlong from the bike. she hits the ground hard; she rolls into it but has trouble getting up. buffy's pov grueller's smiling face appears over her.}
<C>__{grueller}
<D>__{fall down go boom have to see the nurse.}
<C>__{buffy }
<D>__{grueller, god, what did they do you?}
<A>__{he brings his face right next to hers. his voice is no longer passionless; it boils up from hell.}
<C>__{grueller}
<D>__{they killed me.}
<B>__{resume scene}
<A>__{he grabs her and hauls her up.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{no kidding.}
<A>__{she head butts him with enormous force, sending him staggering back. before he can recover, she dives for a pile of discarded lumber, chooses a nasty shard of wood. she turns on grueller, who is smiling again. there are two more vampires approaching her, surrounding her.}
<C>__{grueller}
<D>__{the master walks tonight. this is his kingdom, now.}
<A>__{they rush her. she takes one on as the second hits her, knocking her over. they all three swarm over her, meeting her kicks with raking claws. the two hold her in front of grueller.}
<C>__{grueller}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you know, buffy, i've always wanted you.}
<A>__{he smiles again and leans toward her neck. the stake that pops out through his chest is as much a surprise to him as it is to buffy. he falls backward, shocked and dead. behind him stands pike. one of the other vampires stupidly goes after pike, who runs away. buffy instantly flips the other one over onto grueller, impaling him as well. pike runs more or less in a circle, yelling, the vampire at his heels.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{i didn't mean it! i didn't mean it!}
<A>__{wooden shard in hand, buffy sprints toward them, jumps into a series of flips. she lands with her legs around the vampire's shoulders, plants the stake in its heart as they topple onto pike. for a moment, pike and buffy lie on top of each other, breathing hard. then they get up awkwardly, embarrassed by their touching, (and by their slight arousal).}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{i didn't expect to see you.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{why'd you come back?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{i don't know. i kind of thought i ought to be here. you know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{besides, oxnard sucks.}
<A>__{they start out of the site.}
<C>__{pike}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{listen, i... i really do want to help. i mean, these guys are dag nasty, and somewhere my best friend is out there, and i'd like to, i don't know. even the score. do some damage. i'm good with damage.}
<A>__{angle kimberly's car she drives by, see buffy with pike. it's an eyebrow raiser, but she keeps driving.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{pike, i don't think you're up to this.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{i think i could help. you gonna tell me you don't need help?}
