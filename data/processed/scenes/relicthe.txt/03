<A>__{the taxi swerves around a corner, nearly crashing into a fruit cart, flies out of sight.}
<L>__{exterior harbor belem night}
<A>__{light rain obscures the bulky outlines of tethered freighters. we hear faint laughter leavened with portuguese phrases, distant calypso music from waterfront bars. one of the smaller boats, the santa lucia, is loading as the taxi fishtails to a halt. whittlesley gets out, sees the boat still at dock. his face floods with relief.}
<C>__{whittlesley}
<D>__{thank god.}
<A>__{he tosses a handful of bills into the driver's lap, sprints up the pier as the driver shouts curses after him in portuguese. whittlesley shoves past the dock hands as the last load goes onto the santa lucia. the boat's engines churn to life.}
<C>__{whittlesley}
<D>__{i need to speak to the captain! where is he?}
<A>__{the sailors hold whittlesley back.}
<C>__{whittlesley}
<D>__{get your hands off me! i'm trying to save your lives, you fools!}
<A>__{several crew members murmur the word "loco". hearing the commotion, a squat man wearing a billed hat and smoking a cigar approaches. captain}
<B>__{franco.}
<C>__{franco}
<D>__{american?}
<C>__{whittlesley}
<D>__{yes. thank christ somebody speaks english. i'm dr. john whittlesley. you have some crates of mine on board. they were shipped by mistake to the natural history museum. we have to get them off the boat.}
<C>__{franco}
<D>__{you have i.d.?}
<A>__{whittlesley runs a trembling hand through his hair, trying to keep control and appear reasonable.}
<C>__{whittlesley}
<D>__{no. let me explain. i was on an expedition for the museum on the upper xingu. something horrible happened. i'm the only one who got out alive. i lost everything, my i.d., everything. i have to make sure no one else dies. the crates, the crates were sent out before we knew. there's something unspeakable inside. if your boat leaves harbor with those crates on board, i can't be responsible. my god, if they reach new york...}
<A>__{whittlesley's fists clench spasmodically. franco looks to his men.}
<C>__{franco}
<D>__{loco.}
<C>__{whittlesley}
<D>__{no! i'm not crazy! as god is my witness, i'm telling the truth.}
<A>__{franco barks an order and several sailors grab whittlesley by the arms. they start to lead him back to shore.}
<C>__{whittlesley}
<D>__{don't do this! you have to believe me. your lives are in danger.}
<A>__{the sailors laugh. but with an almost super human strength born of desperation, whittlesley throws them off. he pulls out his wallet.}
<C>__{whittlesley}
<D>__{cash. cash, you see? american money.}
<A>__{whittlesley throws the money down on the deck. the breeze scatters the bills across the bow and all the men, including captain franco, scramble for the money, chattering in portuguese. while they are occupied, whittlesley slips by unnoticed and disappears below deck.}
