<L>__{exterior basketball court day}
<A>__{wide shot of entire court, surrounded by a high fence topped off with barbed wire, as washington and warren escort the acutes including bromden, ellis, a lobotomy case and several other chronics through the gate onto the court, which is run down, with cracks in its surface and leaves scattered everywhere. martini, who is carrying the ball, runs ahead, followed by scanlon, where he starts dribbling the ball in a frantic circle, suddenly passes the ball to nothing.}
<C>__{martini}
<P>__{(as he throws ball)}
<D>__{catch it! catch it!}
<A>__{the ball rolls to the corner.}
<C>__{washington}
<D>__{martini, there ain't nobody there, ya dumb goon! go get the ball!}
<C>__{martini}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{martini turns away, his feelings hurt. washington goes after the ball, when martini goes running after it.}
<C>__{martini }
<D>__{i get it! i get it!}
<A>__{but washington gives martini a body check and beats him to the ball. martini tries to get the ball from washington, who is quite agile and teases him as he returns to the court where he and warren start shooting baskets, freezing martini and scanlon out. the other patients just hang around or walk, as if in a prison yard. cheswick stands in close proximity to mcmurphy and harding, who stand watching the action. mcmurphy finally offers a cigarette to harding, who accepts. they both light up.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro cedure for those group ther'py shindigs? bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{a pecking party?}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{that's right, buddy. and you want to know who pecks the first peck?}
<C>__{harding and cheswick}
<D>__{who? who?}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{ah, come off it! it's that big nurse, that's who...}
<A>__{the other acutes have gathered around mcmurphy and harding.}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{it's as simple as that. you've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of freud, jung and maxwell jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{i'm not talking about fred yoong or maxwell jones, buddy, what i'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{did to me?}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{did to you and all the rest of you guys.}

<D>__{it's the questions she asks.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{tell 'er to go straight to hell!}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{miss ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<P>__{(as calm as blue waters)}
<D>__{she ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.}
<A>__{mcmurphy grabs harding by his balls and harding goes up on his toes.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{she's peckin' at your balls, buddy, at your ever lovin' balls.}
<A>__{harding is doubled over.}
<C>__{sefelt}
<D>__{that kind of behavior will get you a p.a. rating, my friend.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{p.a. what the hell is that?}
<C>__{sefelt}
<D>__{potential assaultive.}
<C>__{fredrickson}
<D>__{which gets you shipped up to disturbed for a nice little zap job.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{electro shock therapy, my friend. five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{tell 'er to go to hell anyway!}
<C>__{harding }
<D>__{and if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to medical surgery.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{harding }
<D>__{lobotomy!}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{lobotomy?}
<C>__{harding }
<P>__{(pointing to lobotomy case)}
<D>__{that!}
<A>__{mcmurphy looks.}
<B>__{shot of a lobotomy case}
<A>__{a vegetable, complete with two half dollar scars in his forehead. mcmurphy as he absorbs this bit of information the basketball rolls to his feet and he picks it up.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<P>__{(to harding)}
<D>__{is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{now, what would i be trying to say?}
<A>__{martini and scanlon rush over and try to get the ball.}
<C>__{scanlon}
<D>__{gimme the ball!}
<C>__{martini}
<D>__{no. me! me!}
<C>__{washington }
<D>__{pass the ball, mcmurphy.}
<A>__{mcmurphy crosses to the court, bouncing the ball as he goes. when he reaches the court he holds the ball out to washington, who reaches for it, but mcmurphy snaps it back over his shoulder to martini.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<P>__{(turning to martini)}
<D>__{pass it to me, martini.}
<A>__{martini holds back.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{c'mon, i will give it back!}
<A>__{martini passes to mcmurphy.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{atta boy, martini.}
<A>__{he passes it back to martini, who laughs and passes it back to mcmurphy, who passes it to scanlon, who passes to mcmurphy, who passes to billy, etc. bromden just stands watching.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<P>__{(encouraging them)}
<D>__{back and forth, that's it. shoot, man, we'll be takin' on the new york knicks before we're through...}
<A>__{mcmurphy looks to see big nurse looking out a window at them. he catches her eye. she turns away.}
<C>__{mcmurphy }
