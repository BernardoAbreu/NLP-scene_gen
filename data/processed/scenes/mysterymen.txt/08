<C>__{furious}
<D>__{what a jerk and like nobody knows who he really is!}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{oh don't start that again }
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{look!}
<A>__{furious picks up the newspaper on which there is a photo of a good looking guy in a tux at a benefit... the headline reads "lance hunt hosts benefit." he holds the picture up next to the television, so the faces of lance hunt and captain amazing are side by side. it is obviously the same guy.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{he's lance hunt! just take off the glasses and it's him!}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{there's a vague similarity.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{a vague similarity? it's the same guy!}
<C>__{shoveler}
<P>__{(downing some aspirin)}
<D>__{0h, who gives a damn who he is? i can't take this anymore. night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps and for what?}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{we take the licks and he gets the chicks.}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{how long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{we need a break, that's all! nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted casanova frankenstein!}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{but look at him... and look at us.}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{the camera loves him.}
<A>__{a depressed silence. furious turns his attention to the napkin dispenser.}
<C>__{furious}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em!}
<P>__{(rips one out)}

<C>__{furious}
<D>__{so why don't you just tell her!}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{raja}
<P>__{(upset)}
<D>__{because i can't! okay? she wouldn't understand!}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{leave him alone. she's his mother, not yours.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{we had an off night, that's all.}
<C>__{shoveler}

<D>__{you're... new.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{it's my first night. my name's monica.}
<A>__{close on furious, smitten by her, but almost afraid to look at her. under all that rage, he's in fact shy.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{you guys going to a costume party?}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{we're superheroes.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{really? like captain amazing?}
<A>__{furious growls.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{are you famous?}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{not yet.}
<C>__{monica}

<D>__{and these are my associatiates, the shoveler.}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{and mister furious... his anger is his power.}
<C>__{monica}
<P>__{(intrigued by furious)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. in his case, it's entirely emotional.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{so what can i get you?}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{burgers all around.}
<P>__{(meaning himself)}
<D>__{medium.}
<P>__{(meaning the shoveler)}
<D>__{rare.}
<P>__{(meaning furious}}
<D>__{raw.}
<A>__{a moment later as monica walks away, furious can't help but watch her. the raja replaces the diner's dinnerware with the good stuff from his coat.}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{she likes you.}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{definitely.}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{ask her out.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{nah.}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?}
<C>__{furious}
<P>__{(getting very pissed off)}
<D>__{what does it matter? women just want to control you and talk about their feelings. they want to know why you're angry all the time and what can they can do to help so you tell them there's nothing nothing just leave me alone but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you until you just can't stand it anymore! so you finally open up you pop like a blister and it all comes spewing out all your emotions your feelings your fears all of it!}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{and then they dump you.}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{so you're chicken?}
<C>__{furious}
<P>__{(fiercely)}
<D>__{who's chicken?}
<P>__{(gets up)}
<A>__{monica stands at the counter placing her order. furious approaches her, leans against the counter. for a moment he just stands there, fuming, unable to think of anything to say. she isn't sure what to make of this.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i guess... are you always so angry?}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{only when i'm awake... you busy after work?}
<A>__{she shrugs.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{want to go out and get drunk?}
<A>__{she's visibly turned off by that.}
<C>__{furious}
