<D>__{last time i spoke with my father, we talked about the state of the world, and he said, "you know, this country was always pretty much a whorehouse, but at least it used to have some promise. now it's just a shithole." i think maybe he was talking about something else, something more specific, personal... this house? this family? his marriage? himself? there was something sad in his voice not sad, he always sounded sad hopeless. as if it had already happened. as if whatever was disappearing had already disappeared. and no one saw it go. this country, this experiment, america, this hubris: what a lament, if no one saw it go.}
