<L>__{exterior jane's garden sprinklers going off}
<A>__{and the plants get watered.}
<L>__{interior jane's bedroom a little later}
<A>__{jane and jake have done it again. in broad daylight and sober. they catch their breath.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{oh, god, it's official. we're having an affair.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{why do you need to label everything?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{because that's what this is.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{yes, in its crassest form, maybe, if we were two other people.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{just because we were married for 19 years does not not make this an affair.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{okay, but since we were together for so long, it's not really that wrong.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{really? you want to run that logic by your wife?}
<A>__{jane fans herself.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{do me a favor, you're on my side. can we switch? i feel disoriented.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{since when is this your side?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{since ten years ago. please...}
<A>__{they switch sides. in the middle of this maneuver jake lands on top of jane. he pauses.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{could i interest you in a little...}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{they flop onto the opposite sides of the bed. jane fans herself. so hot.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(turns to her)}
<D>__{why do you think the sex is so much sexier this time?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{jane pulls the sheet up. they look at one another. he gets her to smile.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i've gotta get to work.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{me too. okay...}
<P>__{(moans as he sits up, then rises)}
<A>__{jake starts to get dressed. jane watches him from bed, checking out his stomach. he notices.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(indicating his belly)}
<D>__{see what happens when you're not looking out for me.}
<P>__{(pats it)}
<D>__{she lets me eat everything.. pasta, cream cheese...}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{can you hand me my robe?}
<A>__{jake reaches for jane's robe, hands it to her. she indicates jake should turn around.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{why do i have to..?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{ because the last time you saw me standing up naked i was in my forties.}
<P>__{(jake can't believe this)}
<D>__{things look different lying down. just...}
<A>__{jake rolls his eyes, turning away from her.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you've gotten a little nuts.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(slipping into her robe)}
<D>__{jake, i think it would be really good for us to not talk for a few days. okay?}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(turning back to her)}
<D>__{you know what i think just for the record? i think we're doing something kinda brilliant. all the things that tore us apart aren't issues anymore. i'd say our problems actually went away.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{what..?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{didn't you always say you felt you weren't being heard? wasn't that our big issue both of us always feeling rejected and unappreciated. look at us now. you're so much more together, you're not exhausted all the time, you're not catering every weekend and busy all day with the kids and i'm calmer, less obsessed about work. i'm a partner. i'm there. we grew into the people we wanted each other to be! and i don't know... i appreciate things about you i couldn't even see before.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(not wanting to get into it)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{well, you know, i'm not as good as you at remembering all the details of our...}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(getting dressed)}
<D>__{ do you remember never having time for sex? now look at us. we've already done it two times this week and it's only tuesday. i swear to god, if half the couples who got divorced, could get back together 10 years later, their problems would be solved. i think we're on to something.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{not sure i agree and...also, we're not back together.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{and i know other divorced people think about this...they wonder what if....}
<P>__{(fixes his tie)}
<D>__{i think this is very french of us.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{how is this french of us?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i have a young wife but i'm having sex with my old wife. not old, you know. ex!}
<P>__{(jane nods....)}
<D>__{i didn't mean old...}
