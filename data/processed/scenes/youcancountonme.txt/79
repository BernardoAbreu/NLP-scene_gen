<L>__{interior wild moose. night}
<A>__{terry has sunk everything but the eight ball. he leans over to sink it. it's a fairly easy shot. he lines it up carefully, and deliberately shoots it so it stops two inches from the corner pocket.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{ohhhh!}
<A>__{a few moments later: terry and rudy sit side by side watching as the 2nd pool player passes back and forth between them and the camera, running the table. "oohs" and "all rights" emit from the spectators. sudden silence. then the clack of the balls connecting. a great common groan goes up. rudy looks up at terry.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{it's all yours, baby.}
<A>__{rudy looks at the table: the eight ball is two inches off the corner. the cue ball is a few inches away from it. a piece of cake, for an adult. rudy looks deeply unconfident. he gets up and tries to line up the eight ball. terry is right next to him.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{just make sure to hit it really gentle. but firm. and hit it a little low so you get some backspin. don't even hit it. just kiss it.}
<A>__{a long moment.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{what do you mean, kiss it?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i mean tap it. firm but very, very softly. and don't shoot until you know it's going in. ok?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{everyone is relatively quiet. rudy takes a few practice strokes and then hits the cue ball, straight, but too softly. it crawls toward the eight and taps it toward the corner, slower and slower, hangs there, and drops. a general "heyyy!" goes up and everyone claps and cheers. terry grabs rudy. rudy smiles, ecstatic.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{that was great!}
<A>__{at the bar: darryl the sheriff, in his civvies, drinking a pint of beer, notices rudy and terry. at the pool table: terry picks rudy up and turns him upside down. rudy laughs.}
