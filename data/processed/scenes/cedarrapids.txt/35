<L>__{interior sunset terrace ballroom day}
<A>__{orin helgesson, 69, a gentle, avuncular man with a mr. rogers persona, addresses a crowd. a banner reading asmi `09: let's build a bridge to the 22nd century! hangs above the podium.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{i'm orin helgesson, your asmi midwest region chapter president. but i'm not going to make you play hail to the chief. not yet anyhow.}
<A>__{polite laughter from the 60 or so mostly male insurance workers congregated in the sunset terrace ballroom, which has neither a terrace nor a window through which to view a sunset.}
<C>__{orin }
<D>__{seriously, we've got a great line up for asmi `09, with our forward looking theme, let's build a bridge to the 22nd century! just so many innovations our newsletter, the asmi teer is now fully digital. so a lot of our breakout sessions will be dealing with this kind of "e commerce" sort of thing.}

<C>__{orin }
<D>__{if you didn't pick up your welcome kits, be sure and see mike pyle, the gentleman in the what color's that sweater vest mike?}
<A>__{mike pyle, 35, a round, milky skinned man who favors sweater vests, raises his hand. he's seated near tim and ronald.}
<C>__{mike pyle}
<D>__{beige.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{in the beige sweater vest. great.}
<A>__{orin continues o.s. but we stay with tim and ronald.}
<C>__{tim}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{i'm worried about this deanzie guy. bill krogstad told me specifically to stay the heck away from him.}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{oh, dean ran for president against orin last year only got four votes. he's running again this year. he's just full of bluster.}
<A>__{tim looks deeply concerned. back on orin.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{... the two diamonds are given every year to the agency that best exemplifies the asmi decree: "to provide high quality insurance services and related products while maintaining commitment to community, country and god." we have a record number of entries this year over 15 agencies competing. good luck to you all.}
<A>__{tim eyes go wide did he say over 15 agencies?!}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{did he say over 15 agencies?}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{yeah, it's gonna be brutal this year. i brought my a game though.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{you're competing?}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{heck yeah. it's the first year i've ever had a real shot. but the guy you really have to worry about is mike pyle. he owns the sixth largest allstate agency in the upper midwest. the guy's a shark.}
<A>__{tim looks at mike pyle, the bland looking man in the sweater vest. tim's confidence is waning. back on orin:}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{... moment of silence for the man many considered to be the michael jordan of mutual insurance agents. roger lemke.}
<A>__{orin places a 4 x 6 foot poster of roger lemke on an easel. a period of mournful reflection follows. until orin breaks out in song were you there?, a somber hymn.}
<C>__{orin }
<D>__{were you there when they crucified my lord? were you there when they crucified my lord?}
<A>__{tim looks around nervously as the entire room joins in song.}
