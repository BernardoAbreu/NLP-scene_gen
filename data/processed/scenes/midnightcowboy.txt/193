<L>__{exterior loft building night}
<A>__{ratso makes his way slowly from the building to the curb, whistling between his teeth sharply, hailing a cab. the cab slows to a stop. then the driver sees ratso, shifts into gear and drives on. ratso bites his thumb after the cab, rests for a moment on the lamp post, then starts painfully inching his way along the deserted street.}
<L>__{interior shirley's bedroom night}
<A>__{joe lies on his back, staring fixedly at a fragile mobile hanging from the ceiling, stirring listlessly.}
<C>__{shirley's voice}
<D>__{that happens. don't worry about it...}
<A>__{shirley leans on one elbow, looking at joe sympathetically, fighting an almost irrepressible desire to laugh. still avoiding shirley's eyes, joe finds a cigarette on the side table, searches for matches.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. uh, where's the matches, ma'am?}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{top drawer. maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.}
<A>__{joe finds the matches, lights up and lies back, staring at the mobile as he smokes, still not looking at shirley.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{first goddam, time it ever quit on me. fact.}
<A>__{the repressed laugh finally breaks through. shirley stifles it quickly as joe sits up, looking at her.}

<C>__{shirley}
<P>__{(controls herself)}
<D>__{no. of course not. just something struck me funny...}

<P>__{(giggles)}
<D>__{i think i'd better shut up, i'm making it worse.}
<A>__{shirley composes her face, reaching out to touch joe. but that doesn't help either. he reacts sharply.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i ain't sleepy.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{i know. scribbage!}
<A>__{extreme close up of joe frowning, puzzled...}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{shee it...}
<A>__{... camera pulling back to show joe concentrating on a game, spread out on the sheet, consisting of nine dice lettered on all sides, the object being to build as many words as possible, scrabble fashion, while a sand timer counts the seconds. shirley watches joe's efforts to think with sympathetic amusement. the only word joe has composed so far is man.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{that's pretty freudian, joe.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what? it's a perfectly good word, ain't it. how much time i got?}

<D>__{goddam sand thing drive you crazy. kee rist. spelling never was a very strong point with me. even in school.}
<C>__{shirley}

<C>__{joe}
<D>__{talking helps. don't talk, you get muddled in your head. hey! now you just look at this here!}

<C>__{joe}
<D>__{y what in hell starts with y?}
<A>__{shirley slyly trails the tips of her fingernails across joe's chest as she leans over to study the game, breathing softly into his ear as she speaks.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{it can end in y day, pay, lay hey, pay lay!}
<A>__{one predatory hand rests on his knee as if by accident disarranging the sheet, talon nails lightly brushing his thigh.}

<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i show you what problem }
<A>__{but the end of his sentence is swallowed by shirley, taking his kiss in her open mouth, crushed by its impact, an animal noise snarling deep in her throat the agonized alley cat wail of pleasure joe's problem is solved. joe's love theme swells triumphant. at the same time, shirley half rises, trying to force joe's head down, her own on top. the issue is joined. shirley has named the game. her objective is to force joe onto his back. joe's objective is to retain his initiative. camera ignores the classic action on the central front, concentrating exclusively on peripheral tactical maneuvers... ... joe's elbows pinning her shoulders... ... her eyes bright, accepting the challenge... ... his tight smile revealing clenched teeth... ... her fingers searching out then tickling his underarm... ... joe laughing as he falls lopsidedly... ... shirley laughing triumphantly... ... his hand closing on her wrist... ... her talon nails clawing the air... ... her toes walking up his calf... ... her legs suddenly locking around his knees... ... her free hand grabbing his hair... ... her shoulder rising as she forces his head back... ... her lips pressing down on his... ... his hand swatting an unidentified mass of flesh... ... her eyes popping, teeth clamping his ear lobe... ... his hand catching her ankle... ... her teeth losing the ear lobe as she screams... ... her foot appearing upside down beside her face... ... her talon nails furrowing flesh, drawing blood... ... his head rearing back, roaring... ... both rolling to the floor, out of view... ... her feet suddenly flying up into view... ... her hand tugging rhythmically at the blanket... ... her other hand wildly exploring joe's back... ... her ankles locking spasmodically... ... her eyes and mouth wide, gaping... ... the blanket suddenly ripping free, flying into the air as her arm flings itself around joe... ... the bedclothes spilling down around them, muffling her ascending shrieks.}
