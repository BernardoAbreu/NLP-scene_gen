<L>__{interior dr. lecter's cell and corridor day}
<A>__{dr. lecter sits at his table, languidly sketching with charcoal on butcher paper. he uses his own hand and forearm as a model. his other drawings, books, and bedding have been restored.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{wouldn't you say, clarice, that for a united states senator, you're an odd choice of messenger?}
<A>__{clarice, sitting again at the desk chair, is taking papers from her briefcase.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{i was your choice, dr. lecter. you chose to speak to me. would you prefer someone else now? or perhaps you don't think you can help us.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{that is both impudent and untrue... tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our billy's latest effort?}
<P>__{(beat; he smiles)}
<D>__{or should i say, his "next to latest"?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{by the book, he's a sadist.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{life's too slippery for books, clarice. typhoid and swans came from the same god.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{tell me, miss west virginia was she a large girl?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{big through the hips. roomy.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{they all were.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{mmm. and what else...?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{she had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. that hasn't been made public yet. we don't know what is means.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{was it a butterfly?}
<C>__{clarice}
<P>__{(pause; staring at him)}
<D>__{a moth... how did you predict that?}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{i'm waiting for your offer, clarice. enchant me.}
<A>__{clarice looks down at her papers, taking a moment to collect her thoughts. she looks up at him again, evenly.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{if you help us find buffalo bill in time to save catherine martin, the senator promises you a transfer to the v.a. hospital at oneida park, new york, with a view of the woods nearby. maximum security still applies, but you'd have reasonable access to books.}
<A>__{he is silent. she rises, moves closer, carrying papers.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{best of all, though one week a year you'd get to leave the hospital and go here.}
<P>__{(points to a map)}
<D>__{plum island. every afternoon of that week you can walk on the beach or swim in the ocean for up to one hour. under swat team surveillance, of course...}
<A>__{his face remains neutral. she puts the papers in his food tray.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{copy of the buffalo bill case file, copy of senator martin's terms. her offer is final and non negotiable. if catherine dies }
<P>__{(she slides his tray through)}
<D>__{you get nothing.}
<A>__{a measured beat, before he rises smoothly, crosses, and looks down at the papers, without touching them.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{"plum island animal disease research center." sounds charming.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{that's just part of the island. it has a very nice beach. terns nest there.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{terns... if i help you, clarice, it will be "turns" with us, too. quid pro quo. i tell you things, you tell me things. not about this case, though about yourself. yes or no?}
<P>__{(she is silent)}
<D>__{yes or no, clarice. catherine is waiting. tick tock, tick tock...}
<A>__{she looks at him. a beat. they are standing uncomfortably close.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{go, doctor.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{what's your worst memory of childhood?}
<P>__{(she hesitates)}
<D>__{quicker than that. i'm not interested in your worst invention.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{the death of my father.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{tell me. don't lie, or i will know.}
<A>__{clarice cannot bear the feverish excitement in his eyes. she looks past him, hesitating again.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{he was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... they shot him.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{killed outright?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{no. he was strong, he lasted almost a month. my mother died when i was very young, so my father had become the whole world to me... after he left me, i had nobody. i was ten years old.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{you're very frank, clarice. i think it would be quite something to know you in private life.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{quid pro quo, doctor.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{the significance of the moth is change. caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... billy wants to change, too, clarice. but there's the problem of his size, you see. even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...}
<C>__{clarice}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{dr. lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. transsexuals are very passive.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{clever girl. you're so close to the way you're going to catch him do you realize that?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{no. tell me why.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{after your father's death, you were orphaned. what happened next?}
<P>__{(clarice drops her gaze)}
<D>__{i don't imagine the answer's on those second rate shoes, clarice.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{i went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in montana. they had a ranch.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{a cattle ranch?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{horses and sheep...}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{how long did you live there?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{two months.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{why so briefly?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{i ran away...}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{why, clarice? did the rancher fuck you?}
<C>__{clarice}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{did he try to?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{no...! quid pro quo, doctor.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. he tries to be. he's tried to be a lot of things, i expect.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{you said i was very close to the way we'd catch him.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{there are three major centers for transsexual surgery: johns hopkins, the university of minnesota, and columbus medical center. i wouldn't be surprised if billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{on what basis would they reject him?}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{the personality inventories would trip him up. rorschach, wechsler, house tree person... he wouldn't test like a real transsexual.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{how would he test?}
<A>__{suddenly dr. lecter snarls, loudly, stretching. clarice take a sharp step backwards before he smiles, turning his movement into an elaborate yawn. he gathers the papers from his tray.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{that's enough, i think. happy hunting. oh, and clarice next time you will tell me why you ran away. shall i summarize?}
<C>__{clarice}
<P>__{(shaken)}
<D>__{yes, doctor. please.}
