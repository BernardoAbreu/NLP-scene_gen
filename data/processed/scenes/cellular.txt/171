<A>__{ 434 exterior inside djumpster continuous ryan is in serious pain. he frantically fishes through the refuse to find: simon cowell's cellphone or rather, what's left of it: a million shattered pieces scattered everywhere. ryan sifts through the plastic debris as if he had secretly hoped he could still use it. yeah, right... he's barely able to sit up when blam!! blam!! blam!! he ducks back down as bullets ricochet off the steel dumpster. as sirens get louder, closer, ryan's got to make his move he jumps out of the dumpster, landing on his ass on the opposite side of greer. blamm blamm blamm!! bullets ricochet off the steel dumpster and ryan summons his courage and takes off limping!}
