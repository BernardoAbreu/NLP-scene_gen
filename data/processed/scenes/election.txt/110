<L>__{interior novotwy bathroom morning}
<B>__{close on a drain}
<A>__{as a hand extracts a huge wad of hair stringy, mucousy. fetid. jim holds it up for sherry, who stands behind him in her bathrobe.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{there's your culprit}
<A>__{he examines it from different angles. both scrunch their faces}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{shall we give it a name?}
<C>__{sherry}
<P>__{(not missing a beat)}
<D>__{dave.}
<A>__{close on an open toilet plop! the hairwad joins several smaller stringy friends.}
<B>__{now at the sink}
<A>__{jim washes his hands. sherry glances between jim and the water running in the shower. it's getting steamy.}
<C>__{sherry}
<D>__{did you know dave's a bed wetter?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{no, i... uh, didn't know that}
<C>__{sherry}
<D>__{all his life. he's tried everything.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(about the shower)}
<D>__{still clear?}
<C>__{sherry}
<D>__{yep.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{we'll let it run awhile}
<A>__{jim turns off the faucet and reaches for a towel. sherry offers him another.}
<C>__{sherry}
<D>__{this one's clean.}
<A>__{jim takes it and dries his hands. sherry now stands very close to him. jim sets the towel on the sink. it's a little awkward as they look into each other's eyes, standing so near.}
<C>__{sherry }
<D>__{i guess you'd better get to work huh? you're going to be late.}
<A>__{she slowly wraps her arms around jim's neck and pulls him to her, a hug of gratitude and warmth nothing sexual here, just the embrace of two people in need of shelter from the storm of life. no, nothing sexual at all.}
<C>__{sherry }
<D>__{thank you, jim.}
<A>__{now sherry begins to cry a little, and things begin to change hands wander, cheek brushes cheek. finally lips meet, tenderly at first. and then it is a deluge.}
