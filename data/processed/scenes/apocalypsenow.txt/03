<A>__{the view finally settles on a partically luxury cabin cruiser harbored at a particular dock late in the day. it is large, pleasure boat: the people are relaxing in bathing suits and towels and robes. they are drinking cocktails, and snapping pictures. the boat belongs to the head of a large american corporation, and this is his party. this man, charlie, is sitting, his shirt off to catch some of the late sun. others have their faces smeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war painterior charlie is going on and on :}

<D>__{... it's crazy sugar is up to 200 dollars a ton sugar !}
<C>__{lawyer}
<D>__{what about oil ?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{food, oil look, let me show you something. this is the economy of the united states in two years }
<A>__{he takes a newspaper, draws a circle.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{this is west germany.}
<P>__{(he draws another, bigger circle)}
<D>__{this is japan.}
<P>__{(another , bigger)}
<D>__{this is italy.}
<P>__{(a dot)}
<D>__{this is iran.}
<P>__{(a very big circle)}
<D>__{and this is saudi arabia... in two years ?}
<P>__{(a gigantic circle)}
<D>__{do you understand ?}
<C>__{accountant}
<D>__{what's to prevent it ?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{maybe nothing. but i will tell you, i didn't build a two billion dollar company in the last twenty years by doing nothing. we can protect our interests.}
<P>__{(pause, for a drink)}
<D>__{we are still the most powerful nation in the world. militarily.}
<A>__{he leans to his associates, in a half whisper.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you know bodyguard; he was a captain in viet nam. you talk to him, except he won't talk. this kind of man can kill you with his pinky. a nice quiet fella, though.}
<A>__{the view begins to pull away from this group.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{carries a attache case at all times. you know what's in it ?}
<P>__{(another sip)}
<D>__{an ingram machine pistol.}
<A>__{gradually, charlie's voice softens as we move away, and a new voice, the voice of someone thinking, comes in over it :}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't tahe chances, and neither should this country. if we're strong, we should protect our interests, and we should have the respect of the world, even if it takes another war.}
<C>__{willard }
<D>__{bullshit. you can kill with the ridge of your hand to the throat; you can crush a skull with your knee... but you can't kill anybody with your pinky.}
<A>__{the view move along the guests of this small party : pictures being taken, some people are swimming. it is the good life. now willard's voice track dominates.}
<C>__{willard }
<D>__{the attache case has been empty for three years, but it makes him safe to think there's a machine pistol in it. i don't like automatic weapons. they jam. i saw a friend of mine get ripped open because he flicked his m 16 to automatic, and it jammed. how much money did the contractors make on the m 16 ?}
<A>__{our view is moving through the people on the boat; some reading, flirting, drinking.}
<C>__{willard }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{he likes to hear stories about nam. i tell him i can't; they're not cleared. the truth is he wouldn't understand.}
<A>__{we can now see a man with his back to us, looking the opposite way. an attache case resting near to him. we}
<B>__{move closer.}
<C>__{willard }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{there's no way i can tell them... what really happened over there. i wouldn't've believed it if someone'd told me.}
<A>__{we are now resting on his back. occasionally, he sips from a beer, but we cannot see his face.}
<C>__{willard }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{there was only one part that mattered for me, anyway. i don't even know if i remember all of it. i can't remember how it ended, exactly because when it ended i was insane.}
