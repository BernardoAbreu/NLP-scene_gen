<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i'm not sure.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i will tell you how. because we committed crimes. but we committed to the wrong thing. you see that was our mistake. we didn't fulfill our potential, we got angry and we took it out on other people.}

<C>__{max }
<D>__{see him?}
<A>__{henry nods.}
<C>__{max }
