<A>__{welles comes up from the stairs, arrives at a closed door. he opens the door. it's a linen closet, with towels and sheets on shelves, and a shelf of medicine. welles shuts the door and moves on. there are two doors ahead, both closed. welles takes the one to the right...}
<L>__{interior machine's bedroom day}
<A>__{welles pushes the door in, enters warily. there's a constant scratching heard. the room is like a child's, except the bed is huge. shelves are full of boardgames and comic books. a danzig poster on the wall. there's a record player with lp records beside it. a record turns on the turntable, the needle caught at the center, scratching... welles eases his way over to the closet... reaching... pulls it open, steps back, gun up. nothing. just clothing.}
