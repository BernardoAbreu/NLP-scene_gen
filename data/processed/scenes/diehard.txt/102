<A>__{under a desk. he takes in his options.}
<L>__{81 his p.o.v.}
<A>__{the feet of tony. they move slowly in his direction. mcclane looks down the aisle next to the windows. it leads to a series of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path if he can make it past tony.}
<L>__{82 tony}
<A>__{he moves steadily toward the area where we saw mcclane.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{the fire has been called off, my friend. no one is coming to help you. you might as well come out and join the others.}
<P>__{(fingers the trigger of his machine gun)}
<D>__{i promise not to hurt you.}
<A>__{moving more confidently, he steps up to mcclane's desk, then around it and fires a blast into the space. it is empty. as the sound of the machine gun fades he listens and hears another sound a noise coming from the other end of the room near the cubicles. tony heads toward the noise. sensing a trap, he moves past each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches the doorway of the last one. the sound is just around the partition. he tenses, then spins into the cubicle.}
