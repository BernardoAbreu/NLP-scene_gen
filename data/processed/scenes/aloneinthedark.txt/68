<A>__{carnby and aline walk down the hallway. framed art hangs from the walls. small sculptures sit on pedestals along the way. the overhead lights in the hallway emit only a low glow, flickering sporadically. aline leads the way with a flashlight. they come up to a door to a second hallway. the hairs on the back of carnby's neck rise up. he touches the back of his neck, spooked. aline notices.}

<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{hairs on the back of my neck just stood up.}
<A>__{aline gets it. carnby pulls out his para meter. it's an old, battered device. the display lights up as carnby turns it on. the para meter immediately picks up some readings.}

<D>__{how come every time you show up, my life gets complicated?}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{i could ask you the same thing.}
<A>__{carnby listens at the door. carnby nods to aline as he opens the door. nothing is there.}
