<L>__{exterior world of donuts day}
<A>__{moments later. simon follows henry out into the street and over towards world of donuts...}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{henry, wait up!}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i am not a rapist!}
<A>__{but henry stops short, seeing... officer bunuel enter world of donuts.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{shit. come on, this way.}
<A>__{and he runs down the street in the opposite direction. simon hangs back, but then follows...}
<L>__{interior church day}
<A>__{moments later. they scramble in and henry is out of breath. he slumps down into a pew.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{keep a look out. tell me when he's gone.}
<A>__{simon does, but then...}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{henry, what's going on? who is that guy? what's he want?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{he wants to help me! he wants to be my friend.}
<A>__{he pats his pockets, looking for his smokes. simon looks on, baffled. he comes closer.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{help you with what?}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{shhh!}
<A>__{he hears something, stands and moves further into the church. simon hesitates, but then follows. they hear someone crying. finally, in a pew off to one side in the shadows, they find... a young priest named father hawkes. he's a wreck. he looks up from his quiet sobbing and sees... henry and simon standing there looking on with embarrassed distaste. he lowers his head in shame. henry moves closer and sits beside the distraught priest.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<A>__{the priest sighs hopelessly.}
<C>__{father hawkes}
<D>__{i doubt.}
<A>__{henry leans back with a sigh and reaches for his cigarettes.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{so, you're an honest man. why beat yourself up about it?}
<A>__{he offers a cigarette to the priest and he accepts.}
<C>__{father hawkes}
<D>__{i don't know if there are grounds for faith. is my vocation relevant? does it make a difference?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{a difference in what?}
<C>__{father hawkes}
<D>__{the world. the way it is. is this a way to help relieve suffering?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{your vocation makes a difference.}
<C>__{father hawkes}
<D>__{how can you be so sure?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{because vocation is the difference. only someone who really cares doubts. listen, father, as i was about to tell my friend simon here, i am, without doubt, the biggest sinner within a hundred miles of this parish. but still, i've gotta stay up late at night to outdo the unending parade of mundane little atrocities i see committed every day right out in the open spaces of this loud and sunlit culture we call home.}
<C>__{father hawkes}
<D>__{you seem to me to be a sensitive and generous man.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i like to think so. but the fact is i appreciate depravity. nevertheless, i insist your vocation makes a difference, because to hold out anything other than a spiritual yardstick to reality is to be jerking off grandly into the abyss. listen, have you got any money? let's go have a drink.}
