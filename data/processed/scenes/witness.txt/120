<A>__{hochstetler has a couple of older folk on board, together with his young sister at first they're not aware of the race, until daniel can contain his excitement no longer and gives his horse a couple of whoops. the buggies are neck and neck, and the older people are not protesting loudly. it's all book can do to refrain from grabbing the reins off rachel, but she's something of a horsewoman and finally she gains the edge and pulls ahead of hochstetler, to the cheers of samuel and book.}
