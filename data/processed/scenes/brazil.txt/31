<L>__{interior mr kurtzman's office day}
<A>__{sam is busily working at the console, unraveling a problem while kurtzman looks on anxiously and ineffectually.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{perhaps the machine's on the blink! it keeps picking up old films. that can't he right, can it?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's not the machine. there's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... ah there we go! that's a b58 732 when it should be a t47 215 ... tuttle ... he should have 31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not buttle.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{oh my god, a mistake!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's not our mistake!}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<P>__{(eagerly)}
<D>__{isn't it? whose is it?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{information retrieval.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{oh, good!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of buttle, archibald, shoe repair operative, but security has invoiced admin for tuttle, archibald, heating engineer}
<A>__{sam is still punching keys.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{what a relief! i don't know what i'd do if you ever got promoted.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{don't worry.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{but if they did promote you}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i've told you before. i'd turn it down.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{would you really, sam?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<P>__{(churned up)}
<D>__{you've been promoted.}
<A>__{kurtzman hands sam a sheet of printed paper. sam takes the paper, not pleased, and glances at it. close up of paper: "lowry, s. (records. min of inf.) transfer to information retrieval (expediting, security level 3).}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{it's your mother isn't it? pulling strings again.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(explodes)}
<D>__{what a bitch!}
