<L>__{interior fluegelheim museum night}
<A>__{it's a party to celebrate the opening of the new egyptian exhibit, and the fluegelheim is hopping. board members, museum patrons, and socialites mill about in dinner jackets and evening gowns, making small talk. an open sarcophagus has been set up as a wet bar. on a raised concrete platform in the center of the hall, rimmed by a decorative moat, sits an ancient egyptian shrine. the temple of bastet has been moved to gotham and reconstructed in the fluegelheim sandstone walls, fountains, statuary and all. guarding the entrance is a stately bronze statue of the goddess bastet who has the body of a woman and the head of a pointy eared cat. she holds an aegis and a sistrum; four tiny kittens romp at her feet. bruce, who's just arrived, is taking an intense interest in the cat goddess...}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i just had a weird sense of deja vu.}
<A>__{he glances over by the sarcophagus and sees provost, the publisher, huddle with eliot tiptree iii, transit magnate the remaining member of gotham's "five families." the two of them are engaged in some urgent conversation which he can't quite make out...}
<C>__{tiptree}
<D>__{harrison we really ought to warn bruce. we owe him that much.}
<A>__{bruce detaches himself from vicki and strolls toward them. provost and tiptree force smiles and wave, affecting an air of nonchalance.}
<C>__{provost }
<D>__{the man's a space cadet. let him look out for himself.}
<P>__{(as bruce arrives; cheerfully)}
<D>__{why, bruce! what a delightful surprise.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{good to see you two. looks like the five families are suddenly down to three.}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{in fact, if somebody dropped a bomb on this room right now }
<A>__{tiptree chuckles nervously. provost is even less amused.}
<C>__{provost}
<D>__{is that your idea of a joke, bruce?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{not at all. commissioner gordon seems to think we should all be hiring bodyguards.}
<C>__{tiptree}
<D>__{oh, that's absurd.}
<C>__{provost}
<D>__{i already have.}
<A>__{the two of them glower at each other. it's like an outtake from the newlywed game. bruce shrugs it off and makes a vacuous face:}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{thing is, i can't imagine why batman would be after us. can you?}
<A>__{provost and tiptree are about to go into another round of hemming and hawing when a new face joins the party. it's selina kyle stunning as ever in an extravagantly revealing dress slit up to the armpits. she's holding two glasses of}
<B>__{champagne...}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{you two look like you need a drink. and is this who i think it is?}
<A>__{she flashes bruce her most winning, seductive, heavy artillery smile. he blinks, temporarily speechless.}
<C>__{provost}
<D>__{selina kyle bruce wayne.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{our absentee board member! i've been wanting to meet you forever.}
<C>__{tiptree}
<D>__{selina's the new curator of antiquities. she brought the temple over block by block }
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{you two won't be terribly upset if i borrow bruce for a moment, will you?}
<A>__{before he can protest, she's linked an arm around his and dragged him off. a nearby fat man spots selina, wiggles his eyebrows and waves brightly. his tongue is practically hanging out he's just dying to write her a check. selina sighs wearily to bruce:}
<C>__{selina }
<D>__{major contributor. i always seem to wind up in charge of fund raising...}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i can't imagine why.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{tax year's almost over, you know. i hope we can count on your usual generous donation.}
<P>__{(indicating provost and tiptree)}
<D>__{someone's got to set an example for those two tightwads.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{they're proccupied. this string of murders }
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{i asked them if they'd consider including us in their wills.}
<P>__{(chuckling to herself)}
<D>__{they didn't seem a bit amused...}
<A>__{angle on vicki that moment she's making small talk with a bunch of stuffed shirts and their overdressed wives. she glances across the room at the statue of bastet, sees selina draped all over bruce. a frown crosses her face... angle on bruce and selina that moment she's still clinging to his arm as they stare up at the statue.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{ and this is my good friend bastet, the egyptian cat goddess.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i think we've already met. this is quite an expedition you've put together.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{i'm glad you think so. i have to say, bruce you're not at all what i expected.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{sorry to disappoint you.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{oh, it's not that. not at all. it's just that i'd always heard you were...}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{selina}
<P>__{(coyly)}
<D>__{oh...sort of a...}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(smiling; fascinated)}
<D>__{no. come on. what?}
<A>__{bruce's state of mounting infatuation is abruptly shattered when vicki sidles up alongside him and territorially takes his other arm. the women exchange big, toothy, plastic smiles; stranded in the middle, bruce realizes they're waiting for him to introduce them.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{oh. selina kyle my friend vicki vale.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{the photographer. i've seen your pictures in the gazette.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{the globe.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{oh, that's right. the tabloid one. what an original dress!}
<A>__{vicki, still smiling, cocks an eyebrow at bruce. he senses trouble coming and tries to head it off at the pass.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{selina supervised the reconstruction of the temple. brought it back from egypt... stone by stone.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{really. she must be awfully tired.}
<P>__{(to selina)}
<D>__{how'd you get to be in charge of a huge project like this?}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{it was easy. i slept with the pharoah.}
<A>__{she laughs at her own joke. vicki responds with a dry little chuckle of her own. selina gives bruce a sharp yank on the sleeve.}
<C>__{selina }
<D>__{excuse us, won't you, sweetheart? we have some boring museum business to talk about.}
<A>__{vicki fumes. bruce shrugs apologetically as selina drags him off out of earshot.}
<C>__{selina }
<D>__{i. short leash.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{pull in the claws, okay? she's really terrific.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{i'm sorry, bruce. sometimes i get a little...aggressive, you know?}
<P>__{(handing him a card)}
<D>__{look, i need to talk to you. come by sometime. i will give you the private tour.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{wait. let me explain about vicki }
<C>__{selina}
<P>__{(shushing him)}
<D>__{i understand. anyone who's that protective must have a pretty good reason for it.}
<A>__{she shoots him one last smile sly, conspiratorial, unmistakably juicy. then she's off in pursuit of another major funder. bruce is thoughtfully turning the card over in his hands when vicki rejoins him.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{how's "business"?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{relax, okay? i like you better.}
<A>__{he scans the room, trying to find provost and tiptree. no luck.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{if you're looking for your fellow millionaires, they left some time back.}
