<L>__{exterior green acres through rickshaw wheels day}
<A>__{through the wheels we see max come briskly out of the hotel carrying his doctor's bag. he's met by the sight of hasari between the shafts of his rickshaw and anouar and meeta perched on the seat.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{on no! lepers! lepers in my neighborhood!}
<C>__{anouar}
<D>__{sshh! doctor big brother, please, we are pretending not to be lepers.}

<C>__{max}
<D>__{na, i will just trot alongside hasari.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{no, please, get in.}
<A>__{max climbs into the rickshaw beside the two lepers and hasari pulls away.}
<C>__{anouar}
<D>__{meeta's very excited by this ride through calcutta. you see, she's never been sightseeing before.}
<A>__{meeta, of course, is blind. max, hasari, anouar laugh.}
