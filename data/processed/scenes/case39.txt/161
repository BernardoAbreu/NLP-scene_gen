<T>__{then:}
<A>__{wham! the door shudders from a mammoth impact. last time, it shook the door, this time it shakes the entire wall. emily recoils, dropping the screwdriver. wham! cracks appear in the door as it bows from the tremendous force. wham!! cracks fan out into the plaster around the doorframe. wham!! half the screws holding the hinges fly from the wall. wham!! the deadbolts bending from the ungodly pummeling. wham!! the deadbolt screws getting yanked from the wood. emily frozen in terror, watching. whatever's out there is coming in. wham!! one of the door hinges rips clean from the wall. wham!! the first deadbolt comes flying off. wham!! the second door hinge gone. wham!! another deadbolt flies off. wham!! the door splits down the center. wham!! the third deadbolt lands on the floor at emily's feet with a metal thud. a breathless silence. then the door rattles and drops loose from the frame with a}
<B>__{dead wooden clunk.}
<A>__{nothing holding it in place now except the bureau and the bed. and now they both start to slide backwards as whatever is on the other side starts pushing its way in. emily topples a high bookcase against the door and pushes back with every ounce of strength she can muster, but it's no use. the bureau overturns, crashes to the floor. emily's bare feet slide backwards along with the bed. and then they stop. the barricade sufficiently breached. emily, in her panic, makes a hasty decision. she hides under the bed. we hold low on the open door as lucy's feet step into the room, the feet of a child, but the breathing we hear sounds emphysemic and the voice is unquestionably male harsh, guttural, taunting emily as it comes for her:}
<C>__{sinister male voice}
<D>__{emily...}
<A>__{wide eyed with terror under the bed, she watches those feet pick their way over the shattered remnants of the barricade.}
<C>__{sinister male voice}
<D>__{emily... we need to learn healthier ways of resolving conflict, emily.}
<A>__{the feet step gingerly past the overturned bureau.}
<C>__{sinister male voice}
<D>__{...most families don't even know they have a problem...}
<A>__{the feet stop at the screwdriver.}
<C>__{sinister male voice}
<D>__{...until it's too late.}
<A>__{a hand reaches down and picks it up, a girl's hand, but the fingers as they wrap tightly around the handle look strong and sinewy. the feet stand motionless for a moment then turn and come toward the bed, stopping right in front of emily's horrified}
<B>__{face.}
<A>__{a pause and then, still from emily's pov, we see lucy lower herself onto her knees. wham!! with shocking force that hand impales the screwdriver in the wooden floor! another pause then both hands come into view, palms flat on the hardwood, as she leans her head down. emily recoiling in anticipation as the face comes into view lucy's innocent face a little girl. with a little girl voice to match.}

<P>__{(playing mommy)}
<D>__{what are you doing, you silly pumpkinhead?}
<A>__{emily, hyperventilating, stares in shock. lucy reaches her hand in. emily backs away, wedges herself in the corner.}
<C>__{lucy}
<P>__{(playing mommy)}
<D>__{you don't want me to come under there and get you, do you?}
<A>__{emily, crying now, shakes her head. lucy, almost sympathetic, frowns.}
<C>__{lucy}
<P>__{(playing mommy)}
<D>__{i'm going to count to three. one...}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{no...}

<D>__{two... two and a half...}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{please...}
<C>__{lucy}
<P>__{(playing mommy)}
<D>__{two and three quarters... three...}
<A>__{lucy starts crawling under the bed.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{here i come.}
<A>__{emily tries to go backwards, but there's nowhere for her to go. lucy's face sliding closer like the head of a snake. trapped, emily screams.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{what do you want?!!}
<A>__{lucy stops crawling. folds her arms, sets her chin on them. comfortable here under the bed. delighting in the question.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{what you wanted from your mother. i want you to love me.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{okay... okay, i will, i will, i promise.}
<A>__{lucy weighs emily's surrender for a moment. then, oddly}
