<L>__{exterior sunken forest. day}
<A>__{inman finds himself in a sunken forest of pine. he moves warily, his beard longer, his figure gaunt, his clothes weathering to a uniform smudge of charcoal. he hears dogs barking in the distance, faint shouts. he picks up his pace, skirts round the swampy lake.}
<L>__{exterior cape fear river. dusk}
<A>__{inman comes to the bank of a huge river. the water, as the light begins to go, is the color of mud, with bubbles, belching to the surface, full of ugly prominent. inman is almost jogging now, an ear tracking his still distant pursuers. the river is too wide to contemplate swimming and now it begins to curve left, forcing him against his judgment, to circle back. he approaches a small jetty. a sign: ferry $5. yell loud. on the far bank there's a cabin on stilts above the highwater mark. inman calls out, reluctantly, his voice still a kind of growl. then again. a tiny figure steps out of the cabin and waves before jumping into a small canoe. the canoe heads against the current, the rower's back bent with the effort. as the canoe approaches, inman sees that the ferryman is, in fact, a young girl, not eighteen. she doesn't look at him. he produces five dollars. she eyes the bill with contempt.}
<C>__{ferrygirl}
<D>__{for five dollars i wouldn't give a parched man a dipper of this riverwater.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{sign says ferry, five dollars.}
<C>__{ferrygirl}
<D>__{this look like a ferry? my daddy's dead, or gone off to the federals, don't matter which. i'm the way across now.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{what's the name of this thing?}
<C>__{ferrygirl}
<D>__{nothing but the mighty cape fear river, is all.}
<A>__{a dog barks in the distance. getting closer. inman turns to the sound. the ferrygirl is well aware of her leverage.}
<C>__{ferrygirl}
<D>__{nobody crosses this water unless they're running from someplace. some cross one way, some the other: makes no difference, they're all running. you want to wait for your friends?}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{i can give you thirty dollars script.}
<C>__{ferrygirl}
<D>__{let's go.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{hey! hey! wait!}
<A>__{inman is astonished to see veasey stumble out of the trees. his head is shaved, his face bruised and swollen, his clothes castoffs and ill fitting, cinched at the waist with rope. he stumbles towards inman, urging him to get on with the journey.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{keep going. we're both in trouble.}
<A>__{he gets straight into the canoe.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{no. get out.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{it's homeguard. made me tell them all about you.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{i should have shot you when i had the chance.}
<A>__{shouts, more barking. inman jumps in the canoe, and they're off. the ferrygirl turns the boat around, rows them away from the jetty with the grace of someone doing something for the thousandth time.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{i'm not looking for revenge, by the way. for what you did to me. no, i'm a pilgrim now, like you, traveling the road, paying our dues, relying on the kindness of strangers.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{you're nothing like me and the last thing i want right now is a conversation.}
<C>__{veasey}
<P>__{(to ferrygirl)}
<D>__{you recall job in the scriptures? i will give free utterance to my complainterior i will speak in the bitterness of my soul. that's our friend here...}
<P>__{(to inman)}
<D>__{they cut off my hair. which was hard. i was vain about my hair.}
<P>__{(to ferrygirl)}
<D>__{i had good curls. but i deserved it. i'm the reverend veasey. have i seen you in church?}
<A>__{inman sits, scouring the bank for sign of his pursuers. the sun is sinking fast.}
<C>__{ferrygirl}
<D>__{i'm saving for a cowhide, and when i get it i aim to get a saddle made, and when i get me a saddle i will save for a horse, and when i got a horse i will throw on the saddle, and then you won't see my sorry ass round this swamp again.}
<A>__{she has no love for the river. another gurgle of viscous bubbles around the canoe.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{ferrygirl}
<D>__{catfish. 'gator. keep your hand in the boat. already looks like some critter chewed his neck.}
<P>__{(she looks at inman)}
<D>__{thirty more dollars, we can go to the cabin. i will pull this dress over my head.}
<C>__{veasey}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{have we got thirty dollars?}
<A>__{a sharp sound, a tiny thwack of ball on meat. the ferrygirl suddenly slumps back and falls into the water. veasey grabs out at the oar, but it goes, too. the girl sinks quickly, a bloody gap to the side of her head. inman, on his knees and stretching, can't help her. then a second noise as a hole the size of a fist appears in the canoe, just at waterlevel. water pours into the canoe. dogs bark, and now figures are visible at the jetty. home guard. one of them has a sniper's rifle and is loading for a third shot. inman can see him sighting the rifle. they lie flat in the canoe. another great fist of wood is gouged out. now the boat is almost full of water. veasey spits out a foul mouthful. inman rocks the canoe and lets it turn over onto them, veasey surfaces from under it, clutching the wood as a raft, but the canoe catches inman a blow to his head and he sinks. veasey hauls him to the surface and, surprisingly strong, holds him with one fist, the boat with the other, lets the current take them, pulling them under, then up, under, then up, but clinging on, as the rifle continues to deliver its assault, another shot into the boat, another into the water near to veasey's arm. the girl's body comes by them, carried by the river, the dress billowing out almost covering her head. the sun has gone, the light fading, the canoe sliding downriver away from their aggressors.}
