<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{tough guy, huh? are you going to be all right on your own?}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{i'm not on my own, am i?}
<A>__{she touches his cheek.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{come on up, would you?}
<L>__{interior dil's flat night.}
<A>__{dil comes in in the darkness. fergus stands like a shadow in the doorway. the light comes on; she takes off her raincoat.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{won't hurt you to come in.}
<A>__{fergus enters slowly. he looks around the room; there is an exaggerated femininity about everything in it.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{would you like a drink?}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{yes, please.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{what'll it be?}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{whiskey.}
<A>__{she goes into a small kitchen. fergus looks at the mantelpiece and sees a picture of jody. the camera tracks into the soldier's smiling face. then into fergus's face. his reverie is broken by the sound of a voice outside dave's. she comes through with two drinks.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{someone out there.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{jesus fucking christ.}
<A>__{she opens the window door, and we see dave on the street, in a neck brace.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{hey, stirling fucking moss }

<A>__{she goes back into the room and begins taking things up.}

<D>__{talk to me, dil }
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{sure, dave }
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{please, dil }
<A>__{she flings things down: men's clothes, leather trousers, a suitcase, a teddy bear.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{take your clothes.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{don't throw my clothes out the window!}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{fuck off back to essex!}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{fucking mad!}
<A>__{fergus looks to the man down in the street, a parody of rejection with his things in his arms.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{don't chuck my clothes out!}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{take your fucking goldfish, too!}
<A>__{dil grabs a large goldfish bowl and flings it down. the bowl breaks to bits on the pavement. goldfish thrash around in the street.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{you fucking bitch!}
<A>__{he tries to pick up the flapping fish in his hands.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{murderer!}
<A>__{upstairs, dil closes the window shut.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{sorry. how'd he drive with his neck in a brace?}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{must be in love to manage that.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{doesn't know the meaning of the word.}
<A>__{fergus stands as dil hands him a glass.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{he lived here with you?}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{tried to. sit down, will you?}
<A>__{fergus walks past the photograph and sits down. he looks from her to the picture.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{what about him?}
<A>__{he nods toward the picture. she looks down into her drink.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{he was different.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{how different?}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{as different as it's possible to be.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{tell me about him.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{shouldn't i go?}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{and they fall into one another's arms. she stretches up with her whole body over him. they grow suddenly and violently passionate. they fall into the cushions of the couch onto the floor. the photograph above them seems to smile. he draws up her dress with his hands. she suddenly pulls away.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{did you do that to him?}
<A>__{she comes up toward him once more. she puts her mouth close to his ear.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{you want to know how i kissed him?}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{yes...}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{are you jealous of him?}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{that's good...}
<A>__{she opens the buttons on his shirt and her mouth travels down his chest. fergus tries to draw her up toward him, but her hand reaches up to his mouth and presses his head back while her other hand undoes his pants. she kisses his stomach; her mouth moves down his body. fergus stares at the picture of jody. jody's eyes seem to burn through him. dil raises her head and kisses his mouth. there are tears in his eyes.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{what would he think?}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{can't think. he's dead. in ireland. he was a soldier. went there like a fool.}
<A>__{she sits in front of the mirror.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{do you miss him?}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{i think you do.}
<C>__{dil}
<P>__{(dreamily)}
<D>__{you say that like a gentleman.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{do i?}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{like you're concerned.}
<A>__{fergus gets up and stands behind her, gently pushes the hair from her face.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{but you can t stay, you know that?}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{didn't think i could.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{a real gentleman...}
<A>__{she embraces him.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{shouldn't you be in mourning?}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{i am.}
<A>__{she sits back down in front of the mirror. fergus leaves. she reapplies her lipstick.}
