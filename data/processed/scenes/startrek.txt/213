<L>__{exterior barren landscape}
<A>__{panning across an alien landscape... and even though it's in shadow, you start to recognize it as the dark side of the moon. our pov ascends now to see:}
<B>__{the enterprise drops out of warp in the dead silence of space...}
<A>__{and we move past it, along the orbit of the moon, cresting the horizon to see earth and nero's ship hovering above it.}
<L>__{interior narada bridge night}
<A>__{close on nero his face illuminated on the darkened bridge of the narada by soft blue light. light radiated by earth. a beautiful hologram before him. he doesn't notice behind him, as those blades from his staff appear behind his neck. nero tenses, only now sensing this unforeseen danger: ayel holds the weapon. strong. tough. but under it all... terrified.}
<C>__{ayel}
<D>__{the men and i have discussed this. what we are about to do.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we have to turn the ship around. we can save our home.}
<A>__{nero turns slowly and deliberately ayel tenses:}
<C>__{ayel }
<D>__{stop.}
<A>__{nero now faces ayel, blades at his throat ayel growing more nervous as he faces his master. the surrounding crew stare on, frozen in the moment, only slightly confirming their makeshift mutiny with scared looks.}
<C>__{ayel }
<D>__{we can go back. that's what we want. we have taken our vengeance on vulcan. no more. we want to go home now.}
<A>__{nero considers this... nods gently.}
<C>__{nero}
<D>__{there is no need, ayel. to threaten me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i understand.}
<A>__{ayel is massively relieved. nero gently reaches out, holds the staff (still aimed at him). he deactivates it the blades instantly retract.}
<C>__{nero }
<D>__{i understand. but you are wrong.}
<A>__{and just as ayel realizes he's fucked, nero somehow activates the staff in a way we have not seen and the blades appear on the other end the end now facing ayel and just as ayel's eyes go wide nero thrusts the blades into ayel who falls to the floor, dead! nero's hard face turns to the rest of his crew.}
<C>__{nero }
<D>__{we will return to romulus when the federation lies in ruins and not a moment before. when those who watched our people burn at last understand our pain, our loss. i refuse to return as a slave! we will return as conquerors!}
<A>__{on the faces of the men, submitting to his will, our music building and then, his eyes on earth like a fucking lion eyes a gazelle }
<C>__{nero }
<D>__{deploy the drill.}
