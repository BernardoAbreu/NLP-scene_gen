<C>__{norman}
<D>__{eating in an office...}
<P>__{(a rueful smile)}
<D>__{...to officious, even for me. i have the parlor behind this... if you'd like.}
<A>__{mary nods. norman walks on, behind the counter and into the darkened parlor. mary follows.}
<L>__{interior norman's parlor (night)}
<A>__{in the darkened room, lit only by the light from the office spilling in, we see norman placing the tray on a table. mary comes to the doorway, pauses. norman straightens up, goes to lamp, turns on the light. mary is startled by the room. even in the dimness of one lamp, the strange, extraordinary nature of the room rushes up at one. it is a room of birds. stuffed birds, all over the room, on every available surface, one even clinging to the old fashioned fringed shade of the lamp. the birds are of many varieties, beautiful, grand, horrible, preying. mary stares in awe and a certain fascinated horror. close up the various birds two shot mary and norman}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{please sit down. on the sofa.}
<A>__{as norman goes about spreading out the bread and ham and pouring the milk, we follow mary across the room. she studies the birds as she walks, briefly examines a bookcase stacked with books on the subject of "taxidermy." close up the books on taxidermy med. close shot mary she notices, too, the paintings on the wall; nudes, primarily, and many with a vaguely religious overtone. finally mary reaches the sofa, sits down, looks at the spread.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you're very... kind.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it's all for you. i'm not hungry. please go ahead.}
<A>__{mary begins to eat, her attitude a bit tense. she takes up a small slice of ham, bites off a tiny bite, nibbles at it in the manner of one disturbed and preoccupied. norman gazes at her, at the tiny bite she has taken, smiles and then laughs.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you eat like a bird.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you'd know, of course.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{not really. i hear that expression, that one eats "like a bird," is really a falsie, i mean a falsity, because birds eat a tremendous lot.}
<P>__{(a pause, then explaining)}
<D>__{oh, i don't know anything about birds. my hobby is stuffing things... taxidermy. and i guess i'd just rather stuff birds because... well, i hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed, foxes and chimps and all... some people even stuff dogs and cats... but i can't... i think only birds look well stuffed because they're rather... passive, to begin with... most of them...}
<A>__{he trails off, his exuberance failing in the rushing return of his natural hesitancy and discomfort. mary looks at him, with some compression, smiles.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{it's a strange hobby. curious, i mean.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{uncommon, too.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i imagine so.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it's not as expensive as you'd think. cheap, really. needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything.}
<P>__{(he goes quiet, looks disturbed)}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{a man should have a hobby.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(after a pause, softly)}
<D>__{is your time so empty?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{oh, no!}
<P>__{(forcing brightness again)}
<D>__{i run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows i might be capable of doing.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you go out... with friends?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{friends? who needs friends.}
<P>__{(laughs, then with gallows humor)}
<D>__{a boy's best friend is his mother.}
<P>__{(stops laughing)}
<D>__{you've never had an empty moment in your whole life. have you?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{only my share.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{where are you going? i don't mean to pry...}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(a wistful smile)}
<D>__{i'm looking for a private island.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what are you running away from?}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(alert)}
<D>__{why do you ask that?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{no. people never run away from anything.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{the rain didn't last very long.}
<P>__{(turning suddenly)}
<D>__{you know what i think? i think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. we scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i was born in mine. i don't mind it anymore.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you should... mind it.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{oh i do... but i say i don't.}
<P>__{(laughs boyishly)}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(staring at him,}
<D>__{shaking her head}
<P>__{softly.)}
<D>__{if anyone ever spoke to me, the way i heard... the way she spoke to you, i don't think i could ever laugh again.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(controlled resentment)}
<D>__{sometimes when she talks that way to me i'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!}
<P>__{(a rueful smile)}
<D>__{or at least, defy her.}
<P>__{(a pause, a hopeless shrug)}
<D>__{but i couldn't. she's ill.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{she sounded strong...}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i mean... ill.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{she had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... i was only five... and it must have been a strain. oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... mother met a man. he talked her into building this motel... we could have talked her into anything... and when. well... it was just too much for her when he died, too... and the way he died... oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating.}
<P>__{(pauses, smiles)}
<D>__{anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(critically)}
<D>__{except you.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{a son is a poor substitute for a lover.}
<P>__{(turns away as if in distaste of the word)}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{why don't you go away?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{to a private island, like you?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{no, not like me.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it's too late for me. and besides... who'd look after her? she'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. when you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. oh, i don't hate her. i hate... what she's become. i hate... the illness.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(slowly, carefully)}
<D>__{wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace...}
<A>__{she hesitates. norman turns, slowly, looking at her with a striking coldness.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{an institution? a madhouse? people always call a madhouse "someplace."}
<P>__{(mimicing coldly)}
<D>__{put her in someplace!}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i'm sorry... i didn't mean it to sound uncaring...}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(the coldness turning to tight fury)}
<D>__{what do you mean about caring? have you ever seen one of those places? inside? laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there? why? has she harmed you? she's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i am sorry. i only felt... it seemed she was harming you. i meant...}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(high fury now)}
<D>__{well? you meant well? people always mean well, they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that...}
<A>__{the fury suddenly dies, abruptly and completely, and he sinks back into his chair. there is a brief silence. mary watches the troubled man, is almost physically pained by his anguish.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i've suggested it myself. but i hate to even think such a thing. she needs me... and it isn't...}
<P>__{(looks up with a}
<D>__{childlike pleading}
<P>__{in his eyes)}
<D>__{...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. we all go a little mad sometimes. haven't you?}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(after a long thoughtful pause)}
<D>__{yes, and just one time can be enough.}
<P>__{(rises)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(cheerfully, correcting)}
<D>__{thank you, norman.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{norman.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you're not going to... to your room already?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i'm very tired. and i will have a long drive tomorrow. all the way back to phoenix.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{phoenix?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i stepped into a private trap back there and i want to go back and... try to pull myself out.}
<P>__{(looking close at norman)}
<D>__{before it's too late for me, too.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(looking at her)}
<D>__{why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i'd like to, but...}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{alright. i will see you in the morning. i will bring you breakfast. what time will you...}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{very early. dawn.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{alright, miss...}
<P>__{(he has forgotten her name)}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{crane.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{that's it.}
<P>__{(he frowns, as if}
<D>__{bothered by not being able to match the name to the memory of the name in the}
<P>__{registration book)}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{she goes out of the parlor. we see her, from norman's viewpoint, as she crosses the small office, goes out into the night. norman turns and looks at the table, and we see his face now. it is bright with that drunken like look of determination and encouragement and like resolve. he starts to clean up the table, pauses as he hears the closing of mary's door in the cabin next door. he holds still, listens. he goes into the office and looks at the book. c.u. the name "samuels" m.s. norman he goes back into the parlor with a mystified expression. the sound of mary moving about her room come over, soft sounds, somehow intimate in the night quiet. norman turns his ear from the direction of the sounds, seems to be fighting an impulse to listen, or more than listen. but slowly, he is forced to surrender to the impulse and, resisting himself, he goes to the wall, presses the side of his head against it. the sounds come louder, as if we too had our ear pressed against the wall. now norman looks at a picture hanging on the far end of the wall he is leaning against. slowly he starts toward it. he reaches it, touches it, reluctantly lifts the small frame off the wall. a tiny circle of light hits norman's face, coming from the hole in the wall behind the picture. this end of the room is very dim and thus we are able to see clearly the light striking norman's face. we move close to norman, extremely close, until his profile fills the screen. the tiny spot of light hits his eye. see the small hole through which the light comes. norman peeps through. norman's viewpoint through the hole we look into mary's cabin, see mary undressing. she is in her bra and halfslip. she stoops over a bit, places her hands behind her upper back, begins to unhook her bra. norman ecu he watches as mary removes her bra. we see his eye run up and down the unseen figure of mary. norman's viewpoint mary, just slipping into a robe, covering her complete nudity.}

<A>__{he turns from the hole, faces us for a moment, continues turning until he can look out the small parlor window. we see, as he sees...}
<B>__{the house in the background norman}
<A>__{he turns his face away, quickly, resentfully. in his face we see anger and anguish. and then resolve. quickly, precisely, he rehangs the picture over the hole in the wall, turns, starts out of the parlor. we see him go through the office and out onto the porch, not even bothering to close the door behind him.}
