<C>__{satch}
<D>__{i'm sorry, frank, but you need to come outside.}

<D>__{dad, what the hell is going on?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(into mic)}
<D>__{just a minute, john...okay? don't go away.}
<A>__{julia now becomes aware of the tension in the voices in the other room. she looks outside and sees phil and the uniforms. she looks at frank and satch with confusion. frank hits the squawk bar again. he wants john to hear this.}
