<A>__{the digital clocks show five fifteen. shoving the descending river of people out of his way, the seventeen year old jamal is forging a path up steps that cross the platforms. he pushes to the middle of the footbridge and leans out on the side railings. he scans the sea of people, desperately. then he sees her: the eighteen year old latika, heart stoppingly beautiful, over the other side of the station. a world away. she is scanning the crowd, as wired as he is.}

<D>__{latika! latika!}
<A>__{but though he is screaming her name, his voice is swallowed by the noise around him. then he sees two thuggish looking men also fighting a way towards her.}
<C>__{jamal }
<D>__{latika!}
<A>__{frightened now, he fights his way down the steps, one figure against an army of white robed people. he gets to the bottom of the steps, is making progress against the tide. but so are the two men. jamal is now on the same platform. shouts her name again. she turns with a smile. but the two thugs leap through a train onto her platform. she sees them, starts running, is lost in the crowd. jamal runs off along the platform after latika.}
