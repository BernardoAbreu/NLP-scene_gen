<A>__{drake pummels blade, flinging his body about like a ragdoll. he grabs blade by his ankle, swings him upwards some thirty feet smash! blade collides with the underside of a massive hanging glass chandelier lighting fixture. blade falls back to the ground, stunned, dropping his sword. drake pounces on him. blade can barely fend off drake's blows anymore. in desperation he digs his fingers into drake's eyes. drake swings both fists downward, hulk style, shattering an entire section of the limestone flooring. a shock wave ripples out from the point of impact, sending waves of two foot stone tiles flipping up into the air, knocking blade off his feet.}
