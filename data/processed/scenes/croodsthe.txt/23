<A>__{the croods tumble through a twisty mess of giant roots and strange plants and land in a heap. they all lie on their backs, disoriented, but momentarily calm. grug sits up first. he turns to the high, high, cliff above them to the top, where they have lived all their lives up to this moment. a few loose pebbles continue to tumble down. there is no sign of the bear owl. the others stand up, and they take in this new place. grug takes a deep breath and then quickly counts:}

<P>__{(hushed, urgent)}
<D>__{sandy? what is it?}
<A>__{sandy lunges at something almost disappearing into a bush. grug barely catches sandy by her leg. grug pulls her back like a dog on a leash.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{no, no! come back, sandy!}
<A>__{sandy has a mousephant in her mouth. grug knocks it from sandy's mouth. a gaggle of mousephants run out from the bush and scurry away.}

<C>__{thunk}
<P>__{(rambling)}
<D>__{so dad, just to be clear, are we looking for the exact same cave?}
<C>__{thunk }
<D>__{if it was me, i'm just throwing this out there, if it was me choosing the cave, i would go with a smaller cave.}
<A>__{as they trek, strange creatures (bear pears, punch monkeys) watch these foreigners. in the front of the line, grug is freaked out. but in the back eep is taking in the wonders. they pass through a curtain of hefty hanging pears. after they pass the "pears" all turn to watch the croods. a leaf flutters down.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{wait.}
<A>__{eep and grug look up.}
<B>__{we pull back to reveal they are surrounded by punch monkeys.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{dad?}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{i will take care of this.}
<A>__{grug launches into his threat display }
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{wwaaaaaaarrgghhaarrraaaarrgghhh!!}
<A>__{he flails his arms around and jumps about in front of the nearest punch monkey. no reaction from the punch monkey. grug stops, confused... the punch monkey now breaks into a broad grin... then hauls off and thud punches grug in the face! grug reels back, surprised turns... right into another punch monkey. it winds up and thud! it hits grug grug reels back into another monkey thud! }
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{alright dad, go get `em! oh, oh, now you got em now they're really hitting you. dad i got it, just stop running into their fists.}

<D>__{hah, i'm loving this.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{grug, when you're done, we should get going.}
<A>__{wide shot: grug is being bounced back and forth like a pinball from one punch monkey to the nexterior the punch monkeys are whooping and hollering this is great fun! the punch monkeys let go of grug and begin running away for no apparent reason. grug staggers backwards into the family.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{that's right! you can't get past this!}
<C>__{chunky}
<D>__{roooar!}
<A>__{a colorful 'bush' rears up it's not a bush, it's a macawnivore! the croods react, terrified grug throws a rock at it. the macawnivore catches the rock and springs! }
<C>__{croods}
<C>__{gasps}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{climb! climb! climb!}
<A>__{grug pushes and forces the croods up a huge tree then as it steps away it is actually a giant animal. grug's pov: a cave!}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{cave! go! go!}
<A>__{the croods jump off the bird leg in hopes of getting to the cave.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{come on! hurry up, let's go! come on!}
<A>__{the croods all run like crazy in the direction grug pointed. they step inside the "cave." slam! the front of the cave comes down. the croods have jumped inside the mouth of a land whale!}
