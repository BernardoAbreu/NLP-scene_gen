<L>__{interior rebecca's living room night}
<A>__{members of the police force, along with forensic people go over the area. dulaney sits on the couch. he looks indifferent as if all emotion has been sucked out of him. troxell is beside him, taking notes. dulaney looks up. a bodybag on a stretcher is being wheeled out of the room. dulaney follows it with his eyes. cardenas enters from the bedroom. they lock eyes.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{paley's confessed to the whole thing. it's like he's got no will to live now that she's gone.}
<P>__{(thinks for a moment)}
<D>__{she almost got away with it. ironic, huh? do you believe in karma, frank?}
<A>__{dulaney doesn't answer.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{well call it what you want. fate. destiny. we usually get what we deserve in the end.}
<A>__{a beat. dulaney looks at him wearily.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{can i go?}
<C>__{cardenas}
<P>__{(to troxell)}
<D>__{you get his statement?}
<C>__{troxell}

<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{then you can go.}
<A>__{dulaney gets up and starts for the door. cardenas watches him.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{frank?}
<A>__{dulaney turns around slowly. cardenas reaches into his raincoat pocket and take out a vhs tape.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{i found this video in her room. it has your name on it.}
<A>__{the two men lock eyes. there is a long silence between them. dulaney waits for cardenas' next move.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<P>__{(holding it out)}
<D>__{i assume it's yours.}
<A>__{dulaney knows that cardenas has seen it. a hint of a grateful smile shows on his face. he takes the tape.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{thanks.}
