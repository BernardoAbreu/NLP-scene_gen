<L>__{interior chasen's restaurant night}
<A>__{the slender waist and ample bosom of janet leigh as she elegantly enters the dining room of chasen's. hitch stands to greet her, his eyes follow her across the room in some private rapture.. alma watches as janet removes her glove and shakes hitch's hand...before he guides her to the spot to his left, across from alma.}
<L>__{interior chasen's restaurant night}
<A>__{hitch finishes telling his story...}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{of course the real secret of mrs. simpson's appeal to the duke of windsor was that she could make a toothpick feel like a cigar.}
<A>__{he's so deadpan... it takes a moment before she laughs.}
<C>__{janet leigh}
<D>__{you know, i've been so immersed in preparing to play marion i'd almost forgotten how to laugh.}
<A>__{hitch summons the waiter with a snap.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{now, you must try the banana shortcake.}
<C>__{janet leigh}
<D>__{nothing for me, thank you. i'm watching my figure.}
<A>__{alma watches all this with a fixed smile.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{you're not the only one.}
<P>__{(to the waiter)}

<A>__{janet hesitates.}
<C>__{janet leigh}
<D>__{i've written a complete history for her...it seems silly, but it helps me.}
<A>__{she turns to pull a leather notebook from her handbag, hitch's gaze locks onto her silken blonde hair, tied immaculately into the classic `hitchcock bun'.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{it doesn't sound silly at all. tell me one of her deepest secrets.}
<A>__{a quick look to alma, as if to ask for permission before :}
<C>__{janet leigh}
<D>__{she leads a double life. for instance, when she works at the lowery office, she wears tweed perfume. but, when she and sam are together, she recklessly breaks out her one expensive bottle "my sin" by lanvin.}
<A>__{she notices alma's expression.}
<C>__{janet leigh }
<D>__{but...i do have a concern or two. i'm an actress but i'm also a wife and mother first, so i'm wondering just how you'll do that shower scene.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{you and the shurlock office.}
<C>__{janet leigh}
<D>__{it's just... i mean even if you shoot me from here }
<P>__{(she indicates a spot just above her bosom)}
<D>__{ well it's not as if my figure is boyish.}

<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{allow me to put your mind at rest.}
<A>__{alma reacts as hitch reaches over and gives janet's hand a reassuring squeeze.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{may i show you some of mr. saul bass's marvellous story boards?}
<A>__{hitch pulls out his folio case and shows janet the storyboards (which we don't see).}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{i plan to shoot quick bits of film from various angles.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{cut together, this montage will suggest nudity and violence but nothing will actually be shown.}
<A>__{janet studies them, deeply impressed. and relieved.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{and having you in the shower will make it all the more tit illating }
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{if you'll excuse me.}
<A>__{alma's had enough. janet's smile falters as she watches alma get up and head to the restroom. she's unsure of what just happened but hitch carries on regardless, either entirely oblivious or not caring at all...}
