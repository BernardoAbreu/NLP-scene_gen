<D>__{don't... go away...}
<A>__{as if he had any choice. lounds' face moves; he strains. his arms are glued to the chair. dollarhyde's hand comes back with a cup of tea and a straw. lounds sips.}
<C>__{lounds}
<D>__{i'd do a big story. anything you want to say. describe you any way you want or no description!}
<A>__{the hand rips off the sanitary napkins covering lounds' eyes. lounds jams his eyes shut. the lights brighten. a single finger taps the top of his head.}
<C>__{dollarhyde }
<D>__{open your eyes, mr. lounds.}
<C>__{lounds}
<D>__{no. i don't want to see you.}
<C>__{dollarhyde }
<D>__{mr. lounds, you're a reporter. you're here to titillate your readers. if you don't open your eyes, i will staple your eyelids to your forehead.}
<A>__{a finger taps lounds on his chest. a touch on his eyelids. lounds slowly opens his eyes. his face goes white.}
<C>__{dollarhyde }
<P>__{(singsong)}
<D>__{well: here...i...am...}
<A>__{lounds' pov: the red dragon dollarhyde opens and drops the black silk kimono. his muscular frame bears the full body tattoo of william blake's red dragon the head on dollarhyde's chest, the tail snaking down and wrapping around one of dollarhyde's legs. his back is to us in a weight lifter's pose. a rolled up stocking covers dollarhyde's head to just below his nose. dollarhyde's teeth are jagged and brown stained. and he smiles at lounds in front of the white screen.}
<C>__{lounds }
<D>__{oh my dear god jesus.}
<B>__{lounds}
<A>__{turns away. the shape of dollarhyde passes behind his head. the kimono is on again. past lounds' head: screen a slide appears. it is blake's painting.}

<A>__{rear of dollarhyde's head beyond him is the screen and the image of freddie lounds with graham's arm over his shoulder.}
<C>__{dollarhyde}
<D>__{before me you are a slug in the sun. you are privy to a great becoming and you recognize nothing. you are an ant in the afterbirth.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it is your nature to do only one thing correctly: tremble. bur fear is not what you owe me. lounds: you and the others, you owe me awe!}
<P>__{(long pause)}
<D>__{we have one more piece of work to do.}
<A>__{dollarhyde leaves. lounds closes his eyes.}
<C>__{lounds}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{didn't take off the mask. please, god, let him not take off the mask. if he comes back with it off, i'm dead...}
<A>__{dollarhme's hand carries a tape recorder. we pan it across the room to lounds' face .}
<C>__{dollarhyde }
<D>__{open your eyes, mr. lounds.}
<A>__{lounds obeys. close: dollarhyde the stocking mask and teeth stained and jagged are in place.}
<C>__{dollarhyde}
<D>__{now you will read this into the tape recorder.}
<B>__{on lounds}
<C>__{lounds}
<D>__{'i have had a great privilege. i have seen with wonder the strength of the red dragon. all i wrote about him before was lies from will graham. he made me write them. now i understand.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{'will graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. because i was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.}
