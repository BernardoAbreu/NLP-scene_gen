<A>__{he's now waist deep in the hole in the floor, surrounded by broken, splintered boards. sounds: ripping flesh, crunching bones. milt shrieks. he is abruptly jerked downward again. he is being eaten from the feet up. as he's jerked down, one of the leaning, splintered boards rams into his chest. milt collapses over it like an old roman collapsing on his sword. a hairy arm reaches up and grabs his neck. milt is jerked all the way into the hole, board and all.}
