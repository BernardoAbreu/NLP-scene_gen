<L>__{interior acheron cave continuous}
<A>__{tamara, her face pale from blood loss, begins to pray in pained whispers.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{it's good that you pray. gods will be here soon.}
<A>__{tamara struggles to speak, her body wracked with pain.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{he'll be here sooner.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{me!}
<A>__{khalar turns to see the outline of conan, framed by the moonlight, looking down at khalar from atop of one the warrior statues. a thick vine dangles nearby, conan's route down from the cave roof above. conan then leaps down to the skeleton covered floor before the altar. it is a killing floor. the two guardsmen leap for him, but conan dispatches them with a pair of strikes. both fall down dead. conan meets tamara's eyes, a look of determination, assurance. he starts toward the altar.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{i will say this for you, barbarian. you are hard to kill.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{let her go.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{you've faced me before and lost. what do you think has changed now?}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{my purpose.}
<A>__{conan lunges for khalar, their swords meeting with a flash of sparks. they fight to a brief standstill when thump,}
<B>__{thump. the altar}
<A>__{tamara writhes in pain as the spikes drive deeper into her head. more blood pours forth. the blood in the channels speeds up and finds the channel leading down to the sacrificial pool. conan makes another movement toward the altar, but khalar nimbly blocks his path.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{you are strong, cimmerian, but we both know you are not my equal.}
<A>__{conan takes the burlap sack wrapped at his hip pulls it off.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{once you used my father to teach your son a lesson about strength. now let me teach you.}
<A>__{conan tosses out what is inside. it falls to the ground, rolling to khalar singh's feet.}
<C>__{fariq's head}
<A>__{khalar looks down at the ground at the head of his beloved son, his eyes gone, replaced by molten metal. khalar trembles in shock and rage.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{khalar reaches for the severed head, giving conan a brief window to rush to tamara's side. conan tries to lift her off the altar, but the bone shackles still pin her down.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{cimmerian!!!}
<A>__{enraged, khalar charges conan throwing all his skill and force into an all out attack. conan simply sidesteps it, then shatters the bone shackle holding one of tamara's wrists. before he can shatter the other, khalar charges again. khalar swings, conan spins, his blade catching khalar's just inches from his face. conan throws khalar off him, knocking the warlord back ten feet. khalar's attack is feral, uncontrolled. he's lost his balance. spinning and striking blindly, conan smashes the second shackle on her wrist. he continues his motion, bringing his sword around to meet khalar's next strike. now khalar looks like the enraged amateur, and conan the more polished warrior. their battle takes them away from the altar. with her hands free, tamara struggles to pull the spikes out and remove the crown.}
<B>__{the killing floor}
<A>__{conan repels another khalar attack, this time striking khalar's chest and drawing blood. the guardsmen arrive from the other side of the cave, drawing their swords. khalar waves them off, his fury aimed at the cimmerian.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{the queen. shackle her!}
<B>__{the altar}
<A>__{in agony, tamara pulls one of the spikes out, then another. she pushes with all her might, lifting the crown of iron off her bloodied head when the guardsmen charge her, pin her down, and force the crown back on. thump, thump! the crown spikes imbed themselves even deeper as tamara screams. the blood now fills the channels of the altar. we follow the trail of blood, down the side of the altar, in a spiral channel around the leg, and in a wide circle around the altar until reaching the channel's end the first drop of tamara's blood touches the sacrificial pool. it boils instantly, multiplying itself exponentially, bubbling forth and filling the entire pool. and all hell breaks loose. a massive earthquake jolts the entire cave.}
<B>__{the killing floor}
<A>__{as khalar singh and conan battle, the ground beneath them on the wide cave floor cracks and splinters. thump thump! the earthquake intensifies and the entire floor of the cave gives way, tumbling into an incredible abyss. conan and khalar alike grab onto the only rocks they can reach to prevent them from falling further. conan ends up against one of the walls on the side of the cave. khalar clings to the rocks on the edge of the sacred pool. their bodies are illuminated by a fiery glow. they look below, searching for the source of the glow.}
<B>__{acheron}
<A>__{another two hundred feet deep lies the golden spired city of ancient acheron. the cave is but a forechamber, the slightest taste of the true glory and horror of acheron. and as they stare down into the ancient city, the shadows there move. is it a trick of the light? no. whatever the dark forms are, they are coming this way, climbing the tallest demonic spires and leaping impossibly far to climb up after conan and khalar singh. khalar gazes down at the city with wide eyes.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{beyond my dreams }
<B>__{the altar}
<A>__{tamara, her body's blood nearly drained, is still shackled to the altar, which now teeters over the edge of chasm, poised to fall into the fiery depths.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{conan!!!}
<B>__{conan}
<A>__{on the other side of the abyss, conan spots her and scales the cave wall, up to a tiered plateau. he moves quickly, trying to get to tamara.}
<B>__{khalar singh}
<A>__{khalar watches, entranced, as the first of the creatures rises out of the pit. they climb the walls like insects, clinging to the walls, their heads swiveling like a praying mantis.}
<B>__{acheronian warriors}
<A>__{the look like the statues above a hybrid part human, part demon. their skin is a perfect black, armor carved of black bone, faces once human but now demonic with blood red eyes and gnashing teeth. they advance on khalar singh, who is furthest down now that conan climbs upward towards tamara.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<P>__{(in acheronian)}
<D>__{i am khalar singh, king of acheron. i command you to kneel!}
<A>__{and this demonic horde advances right for him, their razor sharp teeth bared. unsure, khalar grips his tulwars tight. the demonic creatures draw close, and they kneel. they climb out of the abyss and immediately lower their heads before khalar singh. out of the corner of his eye, khalar spots conan, drawing near.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<P>__{(in acheronian)}
<D>__{show him the might of the army of acheron!}
<A>__{but they do not rush to follow the order. they stir. one of them with more ornate bone armor than the rest looks over at khalar's guardsmen.}
<C>__{acheronian commander}
<P>__{(in acheronian)}
<D>__{first, we feed.}
<A>__{its voice is somewhere between a whisper and a hiss.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{fine. take your fill. i will kill him myself.}
<B>__{conan}
<A>__{conan is on an intercept course with tamara, leaping across chasms from statue to statue. just below him, the first wave of acheronian warriors reach the khalar's remaining guardsmen.}
<C>__{khalar's guardsmen}
<A>__{khalar's guardsmen, who have been watching the events with mouths agape, realize the danger too late. the horde of acheronian warriors leaps on them and a massive battle ensues between the demonic warriors and the soldiers.}
<B>__{conan}
<A>__{his climbing is dizzying, reminiscent of his youth scaling the cliffs of cimmeria.}
<B>__{khalar}
<A>__{intercepts conan just below the altar, his tulwars at the ready.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{your story ends here.}
<A>__{the two warriors square off, fighting even as they cling to the statues.}
<B>__{acheronian warriors}
<A>__{the demon warriors not only slay khalar's guardsmen, but rip their still living bodies apart, dousing themselves in the blood of their victims. it is a violent ritual, both bacchantic and gruesome.}
<B>__{khalar}
<A>__{launches himself at conan, his tulwars sparking off the stone statuary. conan leaps to another statue, parrying the blows. khalar overextends himself, and conan's sword just barely misses his throat. khalar pulls back, tries to settle himself. conan's eyes narrow, he knows what khalar is doing.}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{like a woman, fariq cried and begged me to spare him.}
<A>__{khalar roars in rage, launching an all out offensive. conan backs up slowly, waiting for his moment. and it comes quickly. conan ducks below the tulwars and cuts khalar across the stomach. khalar loses his balance and falls, one hand grabbing a protruding statue arm, dangling over the abyss. conan raises his sword to finish the job.}
<C>__{tamara }
<D>__{conan!!!}
<A>__{conan glances down. the acheronian commander drank his fill, and now moves to the altar itself, his claw stroking tamara's body. with one touch, the shackles open. he and the acheronian warriors drag her pale body toward the abyss. khalar grins up at him through bloody teeth.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{they take her to a place you can never follow. who will you fail, cimmerian? your father or your woman?}
<A>__{conan leaps down to the altar. the acheronian warriors attack. standing atop the altar, conan cuts down all comers, cutting his way through the enemy, working his way to tamara.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{tamara!!}
<A>__{they leap on conan, impossibly fast. they stab him. they cut him. but he does not stop. even wounded, he throws them into the abyss. and he reaches tamara, just before the commander drags her below. he grabs her arm. the commander grabs her other arm, baring his shark like teeth. blam! conan punches him in the mouth with his free hand and the commander falls into the abyss. the bloody conan pulls tamara up into his arms. only for tamara to scream.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{conan!}
<A>__{conan spins just in time as khalar strikes. khalar's tulwar narrowly misses, and conan counters. his father's sword runs khalar singh through. khalar's body falls into the abyss. but the acheronian warriors surround them. thousands climb out of the abyss, teeth bared, closing in on the wounded conan. tamara, badly weakened herself, grabs conan.}
<C>__{tamara }
<D>__{conan, you know what you must do. kill me.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{it is the only way to end this. my death gives others life.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{i cannot.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{you must. your parents both understood that purpose. now it is yours. live, conan.}
<A>__{a tear falls from tamara's face. the demonic warriors prepare to strike. conan drives his sword into tamara's heart. the crown spikes retract and it falls from her head, tumbling into the abyss. boom! a seismic explosion shakes everything, an unearthly gust of wind pulling the acheronian warriors back down into the abyss.}
<B>__{acheronian cave}
<A>__{the cave begins to fall, massive sections of the roof dropping in to decimate the pyramid and the city below.}
<B>__{altar}
<A>__{conan pulls tamara's body away, even as the world descends into dust and debris.}
