<L>__{interior john hay and john nicolay's bedroom even later}
<A>__{the room is spare and neat. nicolay and hay are asleep in their beds. lincoln is sitting at the foot of hay's bed, spectacles on, reading a petition, the others in his lap, pencil in hand.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{now, here's a sixteen year old boy. they're going to hang him...}
<A>__{hay startles awake, then settles. he's used to this.}
<C>__{lincoln }
<P>__{(he reads a little further:)}
<D>__{he was with the 15th indiana calvary near beaufort, seems he lamed his horse to avoid battle. i don't think even stanton would complain if i pardoned him? you think stanton would complain?}
<A>__{nicolay stirs in the next bed.}
<C>__{john hay}
<D>__{ummm... i don't know, sir, i don't know who you're, uh... what time is it?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{it's three forty in the morning.}
<C>__{john nicolay}
<P>__{(not waking up:)}
<D>__{don't... let him pardon any more deserters...}
<A>__{nicolay's asleep again.}
<C>__{john hay}
<D>__{mr. stanton thinks you pardon too many. he's generally apoplectic on the subject }
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{he oughtn't to have done that, crippled his horse, that was cruel, but you don't just hang a sixteen year old boy for that }
<C>__{john hay}
<D>__{ask the horse what he thinks.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{ for cruelty. there'd be no sixteen year old boys left.}
<P>__{(a beat, then:)}
<D>__{grant wants me to bring the secesh delegates to washington.}
<C>__{john hay}
<D>__{so... there are secesh delegates?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<P>__{(scribbling a note, signing the petition:)}
<D>__{he was afraid, that's all it was. i don't care to hang a boy for being frightened, either. what good would it do him?}
<A>__{he signs the pardon. then he gives hay's leg a few hard thwacks and a squeeze. it hurts a little. hay winces.}
<C>__{lincoln }
<D>__{war's nearly done. ain't that so? what use one more corpse? any more corpses?}
<A>__{putting the rest of the petitions on hay's bed, he stands to leave.}
<C>__{john hay}
<D>__{do you need company?}
