<A>__{we fly over a bridge, flanked by a dozen angel statues standing sentinel on either side, leading directly toward the castel sant'angelo, castle of the angels, its ancient stone ramparts lit by floodlights. soaring swiftly up its facade, we close in on a mammoth bronze angel standing atop the citadel. it points the way, all right, its sword aimed directly downward, at the castle itself, as if to say you've found it. down on the ground, several police cars come to a stop in front of the castle at the same time. langdon climbs out the back of one just as vittoria gets out of a car driven by a swiss guardsman. langdon grabs her, thrilled to see her.}

<D>__{cold and wet but alive. where's rocher?}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{i don't know. he took the journals, he's hiding something.}
<A>__{more cops arrive, and a security guard is pressed into service behind them, opening the massive front doors to the castle,}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{this is it. the church of illumination is somewhere in the castle.}
<A>__{cops pour into the courtyard of the castle. langdon and vittoria follow.}
