<L>__{exterior beach night}
<A>__{chuck lies in darkness, his eyes reflecting the moon.}
<L>__{exterior jungle day}
<A>__{chuck is drenched in sweat. he is at the bottom of a hole six feet deep. he takes one last dig with the flat stick, then licks the moist clay that sticks to it.}
<L>__{exterior beach day}
<A>__{chuck breaks open another coconut and gulps down the milky liquid. with a stone knife he digs in the shell for some of the meat, but it's dry and chewy and fibrous. he spits it out, then lies back on the sand and stares at the first stars. half sings to himself.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you deserve a break today...}
<A>__{he is desperately thirsty. hunger gnaws at him.}
<L>__{exterior beach day later}
<A>__{holding a sharpened stick, chuck wades in the shallows at low tide, looking for fish. it's difficult to keep his balance. suddenly a shadow flashes by, glinting in the morning sunlight. chuck hurls the spear, which ricochets off the water and floats away. chuck plunges into the water after the fish with his bare hands. the fish reverses direction. chuck leaps after it and goes under. he comes up spluttering, on his hands and knees in the shallows. suddenly a whole school of fish swims by him, moving in unison, like one creature, splitting around chuck like mercury. he grabs at them desperately. nothing.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{damn fish!}
<A>__{on some rocks he sees clusters of limpets. he takes a rock and tries to dislodge one, but it smashes into a soggy mess.}
