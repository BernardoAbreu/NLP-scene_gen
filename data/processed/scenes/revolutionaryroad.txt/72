<L>__{exterior long island sound beach afternoon.}
<A>__{a baking hot day. the sky is electric blue. radios play, children cry, dogs bark. sunbathers cover almost every inch of sand. we find shep, milly, frank and april with beach chairs, coolers and umbrellas. a child wrapped in a towel sleeps on milly's lap. april wears a pair of dark glasses, behind which she is thinking, thinking.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{so, frank, how's work? they gonna survive without you?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{actually... something kinda funny happened the other day. i did some dumb little piece of work to get myself off the hook with bandy, and suddenly i'm the bright young man.}
<C>__{shep}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{that's always the way, isn't it?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's incredible. i knocked this thing off in a couple of minutes and now they want me to join their team of `specialist' salesmen.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{morons.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it'd be funny, if they weren't talking about so much damn money.}
<A>__{april turns and looks at frank. long and hard. if he can feel her look, he doesn't show it.}
<C>__{shep}
<P>__{(stealing a glance at april)}
<D>__{so, you tempted?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{well, it's kind of ironic, don't you think?}
<A>__{april suddenly stands up. frank and shep watch her walk down to the water's edge.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{she okay?}
<A>__{frank stares after her.}
