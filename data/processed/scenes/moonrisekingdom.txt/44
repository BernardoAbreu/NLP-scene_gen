<T>__{montage:}
<A>__{sam and suzy walk together down a hill, across a field, and through a wooded path eating beef jerky. they both smile continuously.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{are you thirsty?}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{well, if your throat gets parched, stick a pebble in your mouth and suck on it. you can quench your thirst with the spit, supposedly.}
<A>__{sam shows suzy some bits of green and yellow sticking out from under his coonskin cap.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{sometimes i stick leaves under my hat. it cools your head down.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{that's a good idea. it might help also if you didn't wear fur.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{true, but this adds camouflage.}
<A>__{sam stands in a clearing and pulls a handful of dry grass. he holds it in his fist.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{here's a trick. throw grass in the air, and you can see which direction the wind's blowing.}
<A>__{sam throws up the grass. it swirls and drifts vaguely. suzy squints.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{which way?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{unknown. i guess it doesn't really matter, as long as we cover our tracks.}
<A>__{sam and suzy stop to investigate and discuss: a patch of mushrooms, moss on a stump, ferns, poison ivy, and a low bush with purple fruit. sam looks skeptical.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{these might be poisonous.}
<C>__{suzy}
<P>__{(studying them)}
<D>__{no, they're huckleberries, in fact. try one.}
<A>__{suzy brushes off some dirt and eats a berry. sam puts one into his mouth and nods.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{not bad. anyway, they're good for survival.}
<A>__{sam and suzy look through suzy's binoculars at a deer drinking from a stream. suzy whispers:}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{he knows someone's watching him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i agree. why do you say that?}
<C>__{suzy}
<P>__{(squinting)}
<D>__{i don't know. i just think he can feel us.}
<A>__{sam and suzy walk across a fallen tree over a stream. a snake swims on the surface below them. sam assists suzy onto the far bank.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you smell like perfume.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{it's my mother's.}
<A>__{sam picks up two pebbles. he and suzy both put them in their mouths. they click against their teeth.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i brought water, too.}
<A>__{sam and suzy watch a small, green worm wriggling in the air, swaying from a silk thread. they stare, wide eyed. suzy cups her hand a few inches below it and moves it around in a circle. sam shrugs.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{should we catch him?}
<C>__{suzy}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{trout bait. we need worms.}
<C>__{suzy}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{pause. the worm curls and uncurls itself gently. sam nods.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you're right. we'll let him live. maybe i've got a licorice whip.}
