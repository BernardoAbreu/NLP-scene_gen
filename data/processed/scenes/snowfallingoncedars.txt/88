<L>__{interior petersen's groceries day}
<A>__{ishmael at 24, carrying milk and crackers down the aisle of a grocery store, the empty sleeve of his mackinaw pinned up at the elbow. he turns the corner to see... ...three people in line at the register. the second is hatsue. an infant carried at her shoulder.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{i'd been back two months. it was the first time i'd seen her.}
<A>__{he joins the line. the checker glances his way, then looks awkwardly down. this makes the others turn. and hatsue's eyes. meet his.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{the voice, the face, are cool and formal. there is no anger, no unkindness. only the absence of warmth. ishmael nods. his face hard, stricken. his heart pounds in his throat.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{i couldn't say anything. i just stood there, hating her.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{i'm sorry about your arm. kabuo and i. are very sor...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{the japs did it.}
<A>__{no one knows where to look. down, away, anything. but hatsue never blinks.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{they shot it off. at tarawa.}
<A>__{she holds her ground, her eyes soften, somehow. somewhere between compassion and pity. her slender fingers stroke the baby at her shoulder.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i'm sorry i said that.}
<A>__{all the feeling comes to his eyes. everything he will never tell her. a murmur...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{i'm sorry about everything. all of it.}
<A>__{he drops his milk and crackers on the counter. and walks away.}
