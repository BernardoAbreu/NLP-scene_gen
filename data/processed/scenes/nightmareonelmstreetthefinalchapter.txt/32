<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{a crazed lunatic}
<A>__{suddenly screaming into the lens with desperation. dark circles under bloodshot eyes, hair matted with sweat. a guy not having a good day. we pull back to reveal: the man is tightly bound in a regulation straight jacket in a tiny, claustrophobic holding cell. we can now tell that the image is in black and white. we continue pulling back}
<L>__{interior foster home tv room night}
<A>__{gina sits on the couch with a stark white blanket on her lap, watching a b&w 1940's potboiler with something less than enthusiasm. wesley appears in the doorway, checking out the source of the screaming. he looks at gina, who tosses the blanket aside and rises, frowning. the lunatic on television continues his blood curdling shrieks.}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{nice movie, huh? and i came in here to mellow out.}
<A>__{she smiles at wes as she exits.}
<C>__{gina }
<D>__{it's all yours.}
<A>__{wesley murmurs a goodnight, then looks back at the screen:}
<B>__{on the tv}
<A>__{some orderlies enter the lunatic's cell and attempt to sedate him as he thrashes violently, screaming bloody murder. it is gritty and awful but somehow riveting.}
<B>__{wesley}
<A>__{moves to the couch, clearly mesmerized by the scene. he curls up, absently pulling the white blanket around him as he watches:}
<B>__{on the tv}
<A>__{the orderlies in the movie manage to get the needle into their patient, who moans and sobs pathetically.}
<C>__{orderly on tv}
<D>__{relax, will ya, buddy? everything's gonna be just swell.}
<A>__{the second orderly leans on a wall and pulls out a pack of cigarettes from the pocket of his scrubs. (he bears a suspicious resemblance to robert englund.)}
<B>__{wesley}
<A>__{vaguely tenses at this and absently pulls the blanket more tightly around him to compensate, like a cocoon.}
<B>__{on the tv}
<A>__{the second orderly smiles.}
<C>__{second orderly}
<D>__{yeah, mac. you've just had a hard day, that's all.}
<A>__{the orderly produces a pack of matches. he goes to the lunatic on the cot, and lights the match off the guy's forehead. as the match flares, the lunatic screams.}
<B>__{close on wesley}
<A>__{he shuts his eyes tensely as the sound is magnified, becoming a sudden roar that fills the room. wesley blinks his eyes open, looks around from his blanket cocoon. whatever that last sound was, it did not come from the tv. beads of sweat line his upper lip as he nervously glances about the room. it remains quiet, serene. deciding it was his imagination reacting to the scene on tv, wesley nestles back on the couch, laying down now as the camera moves to}
<B>__{reveal}
<A>__{the carpet at the edge of the room is bunched up as though the walls of the room itself have budged a few inches inward. back on the tv the second orderly lights his cigarette as he hands the pack to the first. they both look down at the madman as they savor their cigarettes.}
<C>__{orderly on tv}
<D>__{you heard the man, wesley. just relax. have a smoke with us.}
<A>__{wesley's brow furrows, reacting to the coincidence. then he stiffens as the two orderlies in the movie begin to hold the lit cigarettes over the lunatic's face}
<C>__{second orderly}
<D>__{yeah, wesley. have a smoke.}
<A>__{our wesley has seen about enough of this movie. he starts to get up}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{fuck this.}
<A>__{but finds that he can't move. the white blanket around him restraining him tightly like the straight jacket on tv. he squirms and struggles.}
<C>__{wesley }
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{he struggles harder now, but to no avail. he's wrapped tight, like a cigarette. on the tv the two orderlies torment the straight jacketed lunatic, poking his face with their lit cigarettes. as the lunatic screams, the screams become magnified, again becoming that loud, deafening roar we heard before. wesley squirms in his blanket straight jacket, he jerks his head around, seeing with each of the man's screams, the walls of the room shudder inward and wesley's eyes widen with horror as he realizes not only is he trapped like a sardine in his stark white blanket, but the walls of the room are starting to close in on him. he spins back to the tv set, where: the first orderly is now looking at us. wesley reacts as he notices something familiar about the man's face.}
<C>__{first orderly}
<D>__{relax, wesley.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{dad?}
<A>__{the second orderly bolts into view. he has become freddy krueger.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{yeah, wesley. everything's gonna be great! just have a smoke on us!}
<A>__{as they hold their smokes out toward us, their arms protrude from the tv set with their lit cigarettes. wesley screams and jerks his head away from tv and he hits the floor with an ugly thump. the wind knocked out of him. he rolls. the couch is gone. as he squirms and struggles to escape his white cocoon, the frightened boy looks around and sees that everything in the room furniture, carpet, tv, even the door are all gone, leaving just the white walls slowly closing in on him. then we see that on the floor all around wesley are long, cylindrical white objects. clearly, they resemble giant cigarettes, and wesley wrapped neck to toe in his white blanket cocoon looks just like one of them. he continues to squirm and scream as the walls close in from all sides closer closer pushing the long white things toward him, around him, bunching them together until they are in a tight cluster, as the room crunches in tightly, blocking whatever light source there is, until all wesley can do is scream one last time, and the screen goes black. after a few beats, we hear a huge, deafening ripping sound, and a new light source appears as wesley looks up, eyes wide with unspeakable horror as the giant, scarred face of freddy looms over him, grinning, and we:}
