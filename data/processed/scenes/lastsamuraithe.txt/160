<C>__{algren}
<D>__{about a dozen.}

<C>__{katsumoto}
<D>__{algren san...have you seen what happens to the villages that stand in the way of the railroad?}
<A>__{algren nods. he remembers.}

<C>__{katsumoto}
<D>__{and what would that accomplish?}
<A>__{algren lifts his head, enjoying the feeling of the sun and wind on his face.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{it might give you one more day ... one more fine day like this.}
<A>__{katsumoto stares at him for a long moment, then smiles and spurs his horse. algren follows. they ride together, side by aide, the wind billowing their cloaks we enjoy the ride as they do, the trees strobing by, the sun slanting through the leaves.}
