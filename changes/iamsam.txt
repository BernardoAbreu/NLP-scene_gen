With precision and lightning speed, the mixed up colors and crumpled packets are transformed into neat little color-coded rows.  Wait, this container has three Equals and four Sweet 'n' lows.  The hand quickly plucks the mutant Sweet 'n' Low.  There.  Symmetry. We move up those hands and meet SAM DAWSON as he surveys his domain.  Something about him.  He's extremely compelling, uniquely handsome.  But it's more than that.  Those eyes, they sparkle with the wonder of a child.  Life's cynical edge has not etched it's path across this face.  They light on a COFFEE CUP held by one of the Regulars.}
