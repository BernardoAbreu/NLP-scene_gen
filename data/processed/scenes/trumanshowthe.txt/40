<L>__{exterior lower manhattan. morning.}
<A>__{truman emerges from the subway station and as usual stops at the newspaper stand. he picks up a copy of vogue and flips through the glossy cosmetic ads, surreptitiously tearing claudia schiffer's nose from one of the pages. he returns the magazine to the rack and begins his daily pilgrimage to work through the rush hour pedestrian traffic. pausing to check his profile in the mirrored building, he glimpses the reflection of a homeless man standing directly behind him. truman, spellbound by the man, suddenly wheels around to face him. the homeless han is in his late sixties. more well groomed and well fed than the average vagrant, with a serene smile on his face. from a new angle we see a two shot of truman and the man on a television screen. the homeless man places his hand ever so gently on truman's cheek. truman makes no effort to withdraw. he is transfixed by the the man's eyes. he appears to recognize him.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(almost to himself, mouthing the word)}
<D>__{daddy...}
<A>__{suddenly a distinguished old woman walking a small dog and a young male business executive carrying a briefcase, walking in opposite directions along the sidewalk, grab the homeless man, one taking each arm. a bus suddenly screeches to a halt beside the struggling group, doors already open, and before truman can react, the old woman and the young executive force the homeless man onto the bus. truman lurches after them, but he is met by the bus doors, closing sharply in his face.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(to bus driver)}
<D>__{hey, stop! stop!!}
<A>__{truman thumps against the doors, but the bus driver ignores his cries and the bus roars away from the curb. he starts to run after the bus, colliding with several pedestrians who make no attempt to avoid him. stepping blindly into the street, he tries to hail a taxi. a vacant cab suddenly switches off its "for hire" light as he reaches it. truman pleads with the taxi driver through the closed windows and locked doors of the cab but the driver is apparently oblivious to truman's shouts. frantic, truman, dashes into a nearby parking structure and grabs a bunch of car keys from the key rack of the unsupervised parking attendant's kiosk. running along the rows of parked cars, truman desperately presses the car security buttons attached to the key rings a car alarm chirps and truman turns in time to see the car's winking sidelights. he jumps inside a brand new bmw and guns the car. the parking attendant, alerted by the squealing tires, appears from the men's room and attempts to wave truman down.}
<C>__{attendant}
<P>__{(running after the car)}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{truman ignores the attendant and accelerates into the street without looking, causing a taxi and a postal van to take evasive action. catching sight of the bus in the distance, truman leans on the car's horn as he recklessly weaves past other motorists. he is only a couple of car lengths from the bus.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(reading aloud, the id number of the bus)}
<D>__{two, four, oh, six.}
<A>__{suddenly the taxis and cars directly in front of him start to slow for no apparent reason. truman looks for a way around but the cars crab across the street, blocking any passage, working together almost as if they are running interference.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(shouting at the cars)}
<D>__{outta the way! outta the way!}
<A>__{the bus is escaping. truman suddenly jumps the sidewalk in the car, scattering}
<B>__{pedestrians.}
<A>__{the same cars on the street that seemed intent on slowing his progress suddenly accelerate in unison, anticipating his move. by the time truman reaches the end of the sidewalk, the cars are clustered together on the corner in an impenetrable jam. truman spies the bus turn the corner at the far end of the street and disappear from view. fumbling with the gear stick. he finally finds reverse but turns to find a hostile group of pedestrians herded tightly together behind the car, leaving truman with nowhere left to go. the car door is suddenly jerked open and the out of breath parking attendant yanks truman from the driver's seat.}
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{what the fuck are you trying to pull?!}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(cowering, the fight instantly gone out of him)}
<D>__{i'm sorry! i'm sorry! no harm done! no harm done!}
<C>__{attendant}
<P>__{(feverishly inspecting the fenders for dents, he finds none)}
<D>__{i oughta fuck you up!}
<A>__{the attendant looks into truman's terrified eyes. they get the better of him.}
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{get the fuck outta here.}
<A>__{the attendant shoves truman's briefcase into his arms and brushes him aside. as he departs, truman notices that the traffic jam in the street and the mysterious crowd of pedestrians has dissolved.}
