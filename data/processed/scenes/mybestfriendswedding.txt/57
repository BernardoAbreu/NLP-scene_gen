<L>__{interior women's restroom afternoon}
<A>__{julianne bursts into the enormous chaotic restroom. looks around wildly, no sign of kim.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{yo! immigration!}
<A>__{everybody stops. pays attention.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i got a warrant for ms. kimberly wallace!}
<A>__{silence. from the long line of stalls...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<P>__{(o.s., sobbing)}
<D>__{in here, you bitch!}
<A>__{now everybody's really interested. julianne ignores them, strides to the stall. knocks, like it's a door. no answer.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{let me in, baby, or i will rip this damn thing off its non code compliant hinges...}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{get the fuck outta my face or i'm gonna mess your shit up!!}
<A>__{some scattered applause. from down the line...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<P>__{(o.s., still sobbing)}
<D>__{over here, nitwit!}
<A>__{oh. scattered laughter. julianne moves down the line. stares at the door. we hear the soft, muted crying from within. slowly, julianne... ... drops to her knees. bends her head low. peers under the door. what she sees, prompts a sad warning...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{incoming.}
<A>__{and she crawls under the door, on her belly. we go with her to see... ... kim fully dressed, perched on the closed toilet lid, her knees drawn up, her arms around them.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{pitiful.}
<A>__{and pulls herself up to her knees. kimmy tries to glare, but it just isn't in her.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{haven't you done enough?}
<A>__{the world gets real quiet. an entire bathroom is listening. julianne cocks her head to one side.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{in one minute. you are going to feel so foolish.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{why don't you just drive a stake through my heart?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{have you ever heard of. irony?}
<A>__{irony? kimmy sniffles.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i threw my arms around your husband. and kissed him with all my heart. because i was so happy. for you. nitwit.}
<A>__{and leans close. as kimmy flinches.}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{he's going to take...}
<P>__{(big grin)}
<D>__{the job!}
<A>__{a stunned pole axed moment. and kimmy's eyes spring open. you mean...?}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(beaming)}
<D>__{with your dad, yeah. can you guess why? bitch?}
<A>__{everything inside kimmy bursts free in a torrent of tears...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{he loves me!!}
<A>__{and dissolves, sobbing, into julianne's arms. a beat, for julianne to reflect, and then she strokes her tenderly.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{well, of course, he loves you.}
<A>__{kisses the top of kimmy's head.}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(very soft)}
<D>__{hell, even i love you.}
<A>__{kimmy holds her tight. from her heart...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i never want to go through this again.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{that's entirely understandable.}
<A>__{angles... outside the stall. julianne's feet sticking out under the door.}
<C>__{kimmy }
<D>__{shit! the time!}
<A>__{the two burst out of the stall, hand in hand, at a desperate dead run past us. hear them explode out the door, and... ... five stalls open. women exit, crying.}
