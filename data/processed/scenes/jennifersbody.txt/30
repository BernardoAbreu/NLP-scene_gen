<L>__{exterior kettle high football field continuous}
<A>__{jonas kozelle, the jock we saw sobbing earlier, is standing at the deserted football field. it's a gray, overcast fall day and the wind whistles eerily through the trees. the football is set back a good a distance from the school, and jonas is all alone. in the distance, a tiny figure slowly approaches, it starts a dot on the horizon. as it draws closer, we see it's jennifer. her bright, lipsticked grin is eerie and unmistakable. jonas glances briefly over his right shoulder, indifferent. a few seconds later, he glances again. strangely, jennifer isn't there. jennifer suddenly appears on jonas's left side, startling him.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{hi!}
<C>__{jonas}
<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{oh. hey, jennifer.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i'm crazy sorry about your profound loss. you are crying about craig, right?}
<C>__{jonas}
<D>__{he was my best friend.}
<A>__{jennifer puts her arm around him sympathetically.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i know. i was close to him too. you know, i was there last night in that horrible place. i saw craig a few minutes before the fire broke out.}
<C>__{jonas}
<D>__{you you did?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{yeah. i was probably the last person to talk to him. like, ever. literally.}
<C>__{jonas}
<D>__{wow. what did he say?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{well, we got to talking about you, actually. and do you know what he said? he said you were like a brother to him. not a bro. an actual brother.}
<A>__{jonas's lip trembles as he unsuccessfully fights back tears. jennifer cuddles closer to him.}
<C>__{jonas}
<P>__{(choking up)}
<D>__{i just can't believe he's gone.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i know, i know.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{hey, you know what else craig said?}
<C>__{jonas}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{forget it. it's too intense.}
<C>__{jonas}
<D>__{what? please, jen, you've gotta tell me!}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{well, he said he always thought you and me would make a totally bangin' couple. isn't that so weird?}
<C>__{jonas}
<D>__{he said bangin'?}
<A>__{jennifer reaches for jonas's hand and slides it slowly up her shirt, placing it on her left breast.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{feel my heart, jonas. i think it's broken.}
<C>__{jonas}
<P>__{(choking up)}
<D>__{mine too.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{come with me. just for a while. we'll help each other get through this nightmare. it's what craig would have wanted.}
<A>__{jonas nods dumbly, brainwashed. jennifer leads him away from the field, toward the woods bordering the school campus. they vanish into the woods. in the distance, we see the falls rushing into the lake.}
