<L>__{interior rocky's apartment night}
<A>__{rocky returns home and enters his apartment. after turning on the light, he flips on his record player. he now feeds the turtles.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{look who's home!}
<A>__{rocky notices two telegrams laying inside the threshold. he approaches them with a sense of awe. he opens and reads one. settling on the bed, he reads the other. a knock is heard. rocky opens the door. mickey goldmill, the gym owner, stands framed in the doorway.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(stiffly)}
<D>__{i seen the light. i figure somebody was home.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{hey, mickey whatta ya doin' here? here, sit down.}
<A>__{rocky tosses soiled clothing off a mangled armchair.}
<C>__{rocky}
<P>__{(continuing)}

<D>__{how do you mean?}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{i'm usta seein' ya at the gym, but seein' ya here, in my house, it's kinda outta jointerior}
<A>__{by the manner in which goldmill listens, it is obvious something important is preying on his mind. rocky is slightly uncomfortable, almost embarrassed at having outsiders see how he lives.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{listen, rock, you're a very lucky guy.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{yeah.}

<C>__{rocky}
<P>__{(uneasy)}
<D>__{freak luck is a strange thing.}
<A>__{mickey does not hear. his attention is drawn to the turtles.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{whatta' those?}

<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(stronger)}
<D>__{fifty years. the rep is known around philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but i don't have to tell you that.}

<C>__{rocky}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{ya got a good mind for dates.}
<A>__{mickey deafly continues, becoming more engrossed every second.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{look at this face twenty one stitches over the left eye, thirty four over the right my nose was busted seventeen times, the last being the sailor mike fight new year's eve, 1940, in camden, new jersey what a professional pastin' i give him. here, read about it.}

<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{yeah, ya kinda remind me of the rock. ya move like 'im.}
<A>__{mickey has rung the bell. nothing could please rocky more than being compared to his idol.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{really think so?}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{ya got heart.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{heart, but i ain't got no tocker.}
<A>__{rocky shifts against the wall and lowers himself into a crouch.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{christ, i know this business. rocky, when i was fightin' it was the dirtiest racket goin', see. pugs like me was treated like fightin' dogs throw ya in the pit an' for ten bucks ya try to kill each other. we had no management...}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{fought in boxcars, in whorehouse basements, any joint with a floor october 1931 i fought a bum who put a tack in the thumb of his glove an' punched so many holes in my face i had spit shootin' outta my cheeks i never had no manager watchin' out for me see that picture outside the gym 'mighty mick,' that's me in my prime. i had all the tools. i coulda starched any lightweight husky on the east coast but i had no management. nobody ever got to know how slick i was, but i had a head for business an' stashed a few bucks an' opened the gym it's a dirt hole, i know it, but that an' a lotta scars is what i got to show for fifty years in the business, kid now you come along with this shot an' i feel like it's me gettin' the shot i never got... yeah, we was treated like dogs like them dago's, no offense, in the colosseum in rome there an' now i got all this knowledge, i wanna give it to ya so i can protect ya an' make sure ya get the best deal ya can!}
<A>__{rocky rises and opens a window.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{respect, i always dished ya respect.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{... ya gave dipper my locker.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(almost begging)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i i made a mistake. kid, i'm askin' man to man. i wanna be ya manager.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{the fight's set i don't need a manager.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{look, you can't buy what i know. ya can't. i've seen it all! i got pain an' i got experience.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{i got pain an' experience too.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{please, kid.}
<C>__{rocky}
<P>__{(tightly)}
<D>__{whatever i got, i always got on the slide. this shot's no different. i didn't earn nothin' i got it on the slide... i needed ya help about ten years ago when i was startin', but ya never helped me none.}
<A>__{mickey drops the ashtray and kneels to pick it up... he remains on one knee.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{if ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? just ask.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{i asked, but ya never helped nothin'! like the bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(yells)}
<D>__{rocky, i'm seventy six years old. maybe you can be the winner i never was your shot is my last shot!}
<A>__{rocky is choked and goes into the bathroom and closes the door. mickey struggles to his feet and, like a beaten man, leaves. several moments later rocky steps out and lowers himself into bed. springing up a second later, he runs outside.}
