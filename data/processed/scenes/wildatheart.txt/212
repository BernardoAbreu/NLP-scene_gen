<A>__{when they walk in, the band is playing a slow blues and three or four couples are swaying on the dance floor. there are a dozen tables and a long bar in the room which is done up in a strange dark azquatic motif. eight of the tables are occupied and six or seven men stand at the bar. everyone in the place is black except for one white woman who is sitting alone at a table smoking a cigarette and drinking pearl straight from the bottle. the atmosphere is not friendly, but lula takes sailor by the arm.}
<C>__{lula}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{they step up to the bar and order two lone star beers. the bartender, a tall, heavyset man slowly forms his hand into the bird. he holds his hand that way while he speaks...}
