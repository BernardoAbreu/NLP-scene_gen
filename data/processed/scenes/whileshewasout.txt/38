<L>__{interior coffee shop evening}
<A>__{harried women and a few men, clutching bags full of gifts and impatient children, stand on line for their favorite drug. della squeezes past them to look for cassie. every seat at every booth is full but there's no sign of her friend. della joins the line. she finds herself biting at her nails, a bad habit since childhood. a woman in front of her places an order then moves on to the pick up area. della moves up to the counter to where an overweight sales assistant waits on her.}

<C>__{overweight sales assistant}

<A>__{seeing herself in the mirror changes her mind about the biscotti.}
<C>__{della}
