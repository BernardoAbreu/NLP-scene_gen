<L>__{interior freight elevator night}
<A>__{ralph holds her, slams the gate closed, and flips the switch. the car moves down. cynthia screams.}
<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{alan and the policeman rush up just as the car disappears.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{cynthia!}
<L>__{interior freight elevator night}
<A>__{they descend. she wipes blood from her face. he looks wired.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{ralph, we have to go and get your medication.}
<A>__{she slowly moves to the control panel. he watches her. just as she is about to reach the buttons, he violently pushes her back.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{relax.}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<L>__{interior basement night}
<A>__{the elevator comes down to a stop. ralph throws the door open. it is a huge dark space, a vast store room. cynthia won't come out. ralph gestures politely.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{ralph, i'm not going out. we have to go back upstairs.}
<A>__{ralph grabs her firmly and pulls her out.}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{ralph, please!}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{i have to talk to you.}
<A>__{he leans in the elevator, opens the control panel and yanks some wires. sparks fly. the hum of the elevator motor dies. cynthia is panicked.}
<C>__{ralph }
<D>__{it's very, very, very, very, very important that i talk to you.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{ralph, you're not being yourself. can't you tell?}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{no! this is the real me!}
<A>__{he flies across the basement and, grabbing a chair, smashes the control box for the electric cargo door, the only other entrance. he darts up a storage aisle. he rips a phone off the wall.}
<C>__{ralph }
<D>__{i come down here a lot. it helps me unwind.}
<A>__{cynthia can't see him. he wildly paces up and down the storage aisles. cynthia starts to cry.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{ralph, please! how do we get out?}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{it's been said by better men than me in better ways in better times there is no way out!}
<A>__{she goes to a barred window.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{help!}
<A>__{ralph goes into a rage. he pushes over a huge storage shelf. everything spills and breaks. amid the rubble a pile of surgical blades lies glinting in a pool of light. ralph looks down at it. cynthia sees him looking at it. she is afraid. he grabs some of the blades randomly and disappears. he is walking crazily up and down the storage aisles. cynthia only catches glimpses of him. he jumps up and breaks the individual light bulbs which hang on wires, providing the only illumination. the space grows darker. all the while, ralph talks and talks.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{there are only a few chances for real glory, and most people fuck it up. most people can't even find the noses on their fucking faces.}
<P>__{(jump, break)}
<D>__{you want an example? how about every fucking doctor in this entire hospital? do you think i'm just going to let myself slowly dissolve into nothingness here?!}
<P>__{(jump, break)}
<D>__{i'm talking about a glorious glory. and everybody's trying to drag me down!}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{ralph, please, they said you have to take some pills.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{pills have got nothing to do with it! you know what i'm talking about!}
<A>__{he jumps, smashes the last bulb. she can't see him.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{no, i don't. i don't.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{you do! real glory, hallelujah! the great big gig in the sky. don't play dumb, cynthia.}
<A>__{she sees him at the far and of the aisle. his shirt is off. there are deep, bleeding cuts all over his chest and stomach. he has blades clenched in both fists. cynthia is terrified.}
<C>__{ralph }
<D>__{i think you know the word i'm searching for.}
<A>__{he starts making deep slashes on his arm.}
<C>__{ralph }
<D>__{u, n, i, t, y! unity!}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{oh god, ralph! no!}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{yes, oh, yes! eternal bliss!}
<A>__{he stops and raises the scalpels to his chest. he jabs them in and cuts open down to his stomach.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{ralph, please, stop!}
<A>__{he swats at the one remaining lamp. it flickers on and off. ralph's eyes flutter. he falls. cynthia rushes to him.}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{ralph!}
<A>__{he throws a scalpel at her. it misses, but she is spattered with blood.}
<C>__{ralph}
<P>__{(fading)}
<D>__{get back.}
<A>__{cynthia is crouched down, crying as she watches him.}
<C>__{ralph }
<D>__{join us, cynthia.}
<A>__{the light flickers off, then on. a hand is on cynthia's shoulder. she looks up... it is harris.}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{join us.}
<A>__{the bulb dies. blackness.}
<C>__{voices}
<D>__{join us.}
