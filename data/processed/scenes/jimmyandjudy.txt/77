<T>__{camera on:}
<A>__{i e. rodney's wunderland backroad entry parking area dinko's car day judy drives up a gravel road as jimmy films. they travel through the back roads in northern kentucky. it's nothing but woods outside the window.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{what am i gonna see?}
<A>__{jimmy doesn't answer.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i hate it when you do that. tell me!}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{nope. keep looking.}
<A>__{judy drives some more. the camera is bouncing as they drive across dirt roads. judy tries to maintain her composure, but she can't contain herself.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{how much further! aaa!}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{shhh. just drive.}
<A>__{judy bites her lip and drives. slowly, she comes around a bend as they arrive at... uncle rodney's wunderland parking area judy's eyes go wide.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{oh my god. is that it?}
<A>__{jimmy doesn't say anything. he just keeps the camera trained on judy. by the look on her face, what she's seeing looks pretty cool.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{is this where your friend lives?}
<A>__{jimmy points the camera through the front windshield. now we see what judy was seeing... about thirty trailers, all along the water's edge. it looks like a commune for run away teenagers with crank addictions and budding wannabe drug dealers. the kids are throwing a combination party, barbecue, and drug festival.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{this is where we live.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{we do?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{maybe. if you want to. for a little while.}
<A>__{judy doesn't respond. she just drives. her eyes are starting to well up a little bit. she's getting emotional.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{this is sooo amazing. it's like a dream.}
<A>__{judy's on cloud nine. the place has exceeded her expectations. judy keeps driving as we see young people, all more or less the same age as jimmy and judy. some live in trailers, some in tents. they watch as jimmy and judy drive in. clearly new faces are of interest to them.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{go over here.}
<A>__{out the window, they approach another trailer. clearly this trailer is more important than the others. outside, a dorky looking douche bag type, buddy (20's) talks to some of the younger people in intense language. they all look over to see jimmy and judy approaching.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{stop here.}
<A>__{you can hear the excitement in jimmy's voice as judy stops the car.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{take it.}
<A>__{jimmy hands off the camera to judy, who retrains it on the buddy and the wunderland teenagers he talks to. jimmy gets out of dinko's car and heads up to him while judy films. we don't hear the conversation between jimmy and buddy man, but clearly he's happy to see jimmy. buddy gives jimmy a big hug like he was a missed relative or an old friend. it's all smiles between the two of them. jimmy comes running back over to the car.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{is that uncle rodney?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{no, that's buddy. he said rodney's been expecting us. we're, like, celebrities or something judy.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{yeah! he wants to meet you.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{wow.}
<A>__{camera shakes as judy starts out of the car. camera shuts down.}
