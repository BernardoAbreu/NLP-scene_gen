<LOC>__{EXT. LAFORCHE HOME - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Sun spikes through the jostling leaves of a maple tree. A strong wind bends them back, showing their light green bellies. This is a modest house in a row of modest houses. Propane tanks and farmland at their backs show this neighborhood to be more rural than suburb. CURTIS LAFORCHE(35) stands in his driveway. His eyes, locked on the sky, narrow as he stares at... A STORM CELL stretching out on the horizon in front of him. It's a bruised sky filled with a vicious mixture of black and gray clouds. They swirl in and out of one another sending wispy tentacles toward the ground. Curtis stands, awestruck. The clouds move fast overhead. He looks up as they overtake his position. A light rain begins. The rain pats the ground. It makes soft indentions on his cotton shirt. He watches it hit the concrete, falling harder now. He notices something strange. The rain makes dark spots on the sidewalk. He pulls his shirt out and sees dark spots forming there. He holds his palm out flat in front of him. The rain pools. He rubs the water through his thumb and fingers. It's an amber color, viscous, like fresh motor oil. Curtis looks to the sky, the rain pelting his face now. Jagged, angry clouds blanketing overhead. The wind bends back the trunk of the maple tree. Curtis stands alone at the base of the surging STORM CELL. TITLE: TAKE SHELTER}

<LOC>__{INT. KITCHEN - DAY}
<ACTION>__{SAMANTHA(29) stands at the stovetop stirring eggs in a pan. She's still dressed in her sleeping attire, an oversized T- shirt and pajama bottoms with cartoon frogs on them. HANNAH(5) sits at the kitchen table tearing up a piece of toast and feeding it to the dog. Hannah is a blonde little girl with a large hearing aid wrapped over her right ear. It clips into her hair near the back of her head. The dog's name is Red, a Rhodesian Ridgeback that appreciates the attention. Curtis enters the kitchen and kisses Hannah on the head. In the same motion, he takes the piece of toast from her hand and sets it on her plate.}

<LOC>__{EXT. SOYBEAN FIELD - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Small soybean plants slouch in the noonday sun. A slight breeze picks up, jostling the leaves, but the sound is drowned out by a loud, mechanical rumbling. A spiral drill churns up dark soil as it digs deeper into the ground. Curtis, wearing work goggles, grabs hold of the drill's cabling system and yanks down.}

<ACTION>__{Samantha sits at a table running a long piece of sheer fabric through her sewing machine. She's making curtains. NAT(37) sips a screwdriver from a clear plastic cup designed not to sweat. She's a woman with rough edges. CAMMIE(24) cradles a brown-haired BABY on top of her pregnant, eight month belly. As Nat speaks, she looks out a sliding glass door at her two kids, DJ(7) and SUE(5), playing with Hannah.}

<DIAL>__{Yeah.}
<ACTION>__{Samantha takes a wide line around Hannah, who continues banging the two-by-four into the ground. As soon as the child sees her mother, she stops. Samantha crouches in front of Hannah, gently taking the board away from her. Samantha signs with her hand and speaks at the same time.}

<ACTION>__{Samantha stands and takes the board to a trash pile in the back corner of the yard. A STORM SHELTER is buried in the ground just behind the pile. It's a grass covered mound with two rusted metal doors angled toward the sky. She throws the board onto the heap and wipes her hands on her pants. Staring at the pile, she lets out an irritated sigh. Thunder rumbles low in the distance. She looks up at the approaching clouds and calls to the children as she walks back inside.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{THUNDER STRIKE.}
<ACTION>__{The drill bit spins as rain pelts the ground turning the dark soil into black mud. Curtis holds a rain slicker over his head. He watches as the hole they are drilling fills up with brown water. He lifts his boot, which makes a sucking sound as it dislodges from the mud. Looking at the horizon, he sees no sign of the storm letting up. He looks to Dewart, who smiles at him from behind the controls of the rig.}

<ACTION>__{Running for her car holding a jacket covered car seat. Samantha closes the door and listens to her quiet house. The rain outside is the only noise. She heads to the kitchen. IN THE KITCHEN, Hannah is sitting Indian-style at the glass doors watching the rain. Samantha walks over and kneels down behind her. She wraps her arms around Hannah, who lifts a hand to the glass.}

<DIAL>__{Can you sign s-t-o-r-m?}
<ACTION>__{Samantha puts her hand onto the glass next to Hannah's and signs "s-t-o-r-m". Hannah turns to see her mother's face, and Samantha uses both hands to make the signed symbol. Fingers, spread and bent, moved downward.}

CURTIS' TRUCK/DEWART'S HOUSE - NIGHT The blue top of a small cooler is knocked to the floorboard as Dewart fishes the last Busch tallboy out of icy water. He cracks it open and takes an extended sip. Curtis, sitting behind the wheel of his truck, looks at his drunk friend.}

<DIAL>__{Good night.}
<ACTION>__{Nat, in a house robe and slippers, weaves her way through the maze of junk on their front lawn. Dewart passes her without saying a word. Curtis watches as she follows him inside the house, still talking. He shifts into drive and pulls away.}
<LOC>__{INT. LAFORCHE HOME - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The lights are out and the house is quiet. Curtis eases open the front door and steps inside. Standing on the door mat, he slips off his mud-caked boots and gently sets them aside. AT HANNAH'S BEDROOM DOOR, Curtis places his palm flat on the door and lets it open. Hannah is curled up with the covers. He watches her sleep. Samantha, barefoot and wearing a sleep shirt, walks up behind Curtis. He turns his head when she approaches.}

<ACTION>__{He pulls her tight. They stand together in the doorway. The house is silent.}
<LOC>__{EXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Curtis loads pieces from the trash pile into a wheelbarrow. He keeps an eye on Hannah as she jumps on a small, plastic playscape in the middle of the backyard. The dog, Red, paces by the back door. He's agitated, but his movement is limited by the length of rope tied from his collar to a nearby post. He barks.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{THUNDER STRIKES.}
<ACTION>__{Curtis flinches at the loud boom. He looks to the sky and sees dark clouds twisting overhead. Hannah plays, unaffected by the noise. To get a better view, Curtis moves from beneath a tree in the corner of the yard and surveys the large swath of farmland that runs up to his property. Chain-link fencing partitions the yard from a deep concrete culvert that leads out to the open field. A giant STORM CELL gathers force on the horizon there. Red barks incessantly. He winces and strains against the rope tied to his collar. Curtis flinches again as A BOLT OF LIGHTNING streaks to the ground in the distance. Sparks shoot into the air leaving a circle of scorched crops. Another CRACK of thunder. A light rain begins. Red snaps his head around and bucks into the air. He gnashes at the rope. Curtis collects Hannah off the playscape and turns back to the approaching STORM CELL. He holds up his hand and studies the falling rain. It's the thick, amber colored liquid. With Hannah in his arms, Curtis watches, awestruck, as wispy tentacles drip to the ground forming a collection of THREE TORNADOS out in the field. Behind them, Red's teeth fray the rope at his collar. He thrashes his head, the rope SNAPS, and the dog flies toward Curtis and Hannah. Curtis turns to see Red charging them. He barely has time to set Hannah down before Red catches him by the forearm. They crash to the ground, tangled together. Rain coming down hard now. Curtis yells and waves Hannah back. Red, snapping, buries his teeth into the muscles in Curtis' arm. Blood streams from the wound. Curtis screams in pain.}
<LOC>__{INT. BEDROOM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Curtis bolts up in bed grabbing his forearm. He grinds his teeth and doubles over in pain. It takes a moment for him to find his bearings. His breathing slows. He gently rubs his hand over the skin on his arm. Sweat has collected around his collar and temples. From the bed, sheets in a twisted mess, he looks around the room unsure of what just happened to him.}
<LOC>__{INT. KITCHEN - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Eggs cool on a plate. Curtis sits at the kitchen table dressed for work. He stares vacantly at his breakfast. He looks up at Hannah. She sits on the floor surrounded by toy building blocks and plays with the dog. She rubs under Red's chest and in turn he licks her face. She smiles and gently pushes him away. Samantha sits with her knees up drinking coffee.}

<DIAL>__{She's fine down there. She had toast already.}
<ACTION>__{Curtis, against flailing, manages to get Hannah in her chair. Curtis backs off, frustrated. Hannah climbs down from her chair and goes back to the floor and the dog.}
