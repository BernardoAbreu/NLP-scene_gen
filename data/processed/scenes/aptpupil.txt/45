<L>__{interior dussander's bedroom night}
<A>__{dussander watches archie collect the cans and bottles. there is something about archie that makes dussander wonder if he has seen him before. archie looks up, right into dussander's window, as if he were expecting him to be there. the two stare at one another for a long moment. suddenly dussander is aware that he is dressed in the ss uniform. he quickly steps back from the window. his breathing is short and erratic as he waits in the shadows for archie to finish. after a long moment, the noise from the street stops. we hear only the faint steps of archie walking away.}
