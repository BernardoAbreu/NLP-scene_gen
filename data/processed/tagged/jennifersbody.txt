<A>__{anita "needy" lesnicki, 17, sits on her hospital bed in pajamas. she's a plain faced girl with a haunted expression. as she stares out the window, she winds colored yarn around a pair of popsicle sticks to create a "god's eye." out a single window, we see an imposing nine foot}
<B>__{security fence.}
<A>__{next to needy, we see a pile of unopened mail scattered casually on the floor. there are letters, packages, even creepy little gifts and totems sent by admiring "fans."}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{every day, i get letters. i think i get more letters than santa claus, zac efron and dr. phil combined. i'm kind of the shit.}

<D>__{grassy ass, raymundo.}
<A>__{needy stands up and begins changing into an institutional gym uniform. as she slips off her pajamas, we can see a series of puffy, slash like scars on her body.}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{sometimes the letters are from people who say they're praying for me. they tell me everything will be okay if i just accept jesus christ into my heart. i say the words, but nothing ever happens. nobody comes back. nobody gets off the cross.}
<A>__{she glances sadly at a photo of a boy on her dresser. she touches the frame wistfully, her eyes full of remorse.}
<C>__{needy v.o. }
<D>__{occasionally i get presents from starfuckers who saw my picture in the paper and want to marry me or something. they think they can take me away from all this.}
<C>__{needy v.o. }
<D>__{like i'd really date some perverted chester with a hard on for jailbait. i might be insane, but i'm not desperate.}
<A>__{we see a morbid "hall of fame" of creepy photos sent in from guys. they line the mirror, grinning at us. there's even a dick shot tucked in there. needy pulls on her threadbare uniform t shirt. it hangs down to her knees, covering her shorts.}
<C>__{needy v.o. }
<D>__{a lot of people ask me if i'm sorry i did it.}
<A>__{needy picks up a paper cup of colorful pills on her dresser, dumps the meds into her mouth, and dry swallows them.}

<L>__{interior leech lake hospital gymnasium morning}
<A>__{several badminton courts are set up in the gym. as an intense operatic aria plays over the public address system, the female patients enthusiastically almost violently whack at the flying shuttlecocks. the patients appear to be varying levels of crazy. a toothless woman grins as she dives with her racket, clipping her partner in the leg. in the corner, one forlorn patient nurses her injured arm while another hurls her racket against the wall again and again. counselors look on approvingly, despite how miserable their charges appear. in the background, a few sulking patients jump rope. needy enters the gym unnoticed, padding along in her bunny slippers.}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{welcome to the mental olympics. they're big on recreation here. supposedly it helps us vent our aggressions. we've traded in our hatchets for rackets, our drain o bombs for double dutch.}

<A>__{nelly shuffles over to a tetherball and takes a furious whack at it.}
<L>__{interior leech lake cafeteria one hour later}
<A>__{the freshly showered patients assemble for breakfast. they grab trays and settle into noisy cliques. needy selects a single toaster pastry from the breakfast line and sits down, alone.}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{personally, i think they're trying to wear us out. keep us sluggish so there won't be an uprising. well, those j.v. tactics won't work against me. i'm a kicker. k i c k e r. it even says so on my chart.}
<A>__{we briefly cut to needy's chart, on some doctor's clipboard. we see her name: anita "needy" lesnicki and a few brief details about first degree murder and grandiose notions. beneath that, we see a triple highlighted warning in bright ink: kicker. a nutritionist with a clipboard approaches needy casually and eyes her breakfast plate.}
<C>__{nutritionist}
<D>__{just one toastem, huh?}
<C>__{needy}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i like toastems.}
<C>__{nutritionist}
<D>__{that's good. but i'm not sure a toastem can provide you with sufficient energy for your day. i'd recommend more complex carbohydrates...}
<A>__{needy scrambles to her feet and delivers a sudden, powerful roundhouse kick to the nutritionist's face.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{i'd recommend that you shut the fuck up!}
<A>__{the nutritionist is knocked off her feet as if she's been kicked by a far mightier creature than needy and collapses, clutching her bleeding nose. we see that the bone has snapped. the patients shriek. chaos. as needy is restrained by staff members, she thrashes like a trapped fish. needy snorts up a killer loogie and hocks it at the prone nutritionist. the glob nails her in the eye. it takes four staff members to haul needy away as she hollers in protest. the nutritionist curls up on the floor, cupping her bleeding nose as a ring of curious patients surrounds her. she spits out a tooth.}

<D>__{i wasn't always this cracked. i used to be normal well, as normal as any girl under the influence of teenage hormones. but after the killings began, i started to feel, i don't know... loose around the edges or something. i was coming undone like those jeans i made in home ec. falling to pieces like patsy cline. shredded like moo shu pork. dead inside.}
<A>__{needy cringes as she briefly hallucinates abstract shapes in the darkness. grinning skulls. faces drained of life, half eaten. grimaces of terror. suddenly, soft music is piped into "the hole," ostensibly to calm the patients in solitary. needy shudders and recoils at the sound of it. it's a cheesy rock ballad that we'll soon hear again...}
<C>__{cheesy song lyrics}
<D>__{"through the trees, i will find you. heal the ruins left inside you. and the stars will remind you, we'll meet again..."}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{god, i hate this fucking song.}

<C>__{needy}
<D>__{this is where it all went down. "devil's kettle" sounds twisted, i know, but the place just is named after a dumb waterfall.}
<L>__{exterior the falls night (to establish)}
<A>__{we see the titular falls, surprisingly powerful, gushing over a rock face.}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{well technically, it's two waterfalls. one of them is normal it empties into a river basin. but the other one goes into a hole. and it doesn't come out. the scientist guys can't explain it. they've dropped all kinds of things down there bouncy balls, red dye, radioactive slime but nothing ever surfaces.}

<L>__{interior jennifer's bedroom same}
<A>__{jennifer check lies on her bed, fidgeting as she watches tv. she's a girl of 16 with long, matted hair and a thin, frail body. her features are gorgeous, but she looks sick and haggard. she picks at her skin with yellowed, nosferatu like fingernails and chews idly on a limp lock of hair. jennifer wears a tight t shirt that says kettle high flags and underwear. an `80s horror movie flickers on the tv. jennifer half watches, distracted.}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{jennifer didn't always look this rough. actually, she was the prettiest girl in devil's kettle when she wasn't so...hungry.}

<D>__{she hadn't fed in weeks.}
<A>__{jennifer rolls over and glances at the window briefly. we see the outside of the house again. it's dark and silent, but for the nearly inaudible snapping of twigs. jennifer turns her attention back to the tv. suddenly, we see needy's face pop up against the window, white and startling. before jennifer notices, the face disappears. outside the house, the bushes rustle. needy is crouched below the window. we hear the pulsing of her heart as if via ultrasound. it's a wet, rhythmic sound: sploish, sploish, sploish. inside, jennifer stretches and shuts off the tv. she turns out the light. a beat of silence. then, the sound of cracking near the window.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{needy plunges through the window, screaming and brandishing a hammer. she takes a swing at jennifer's head, but misses and buries it in the wall, specifically in jennifer's fall out boy poster. needy throws herself on top of jennifer. she straddles jennifer and grips her throat, throttling her.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{you'll throw me a bone, huh? huh? you killed chip! you goddamned monster! you...zombitch!}
<A>__{jennifer struggles to fight off needy in the darkness. her clawlike fingernails rake needy's back and arms. needy pulls a box cutter out of her waistband and flicks it open like a switchblade. kshink!}

<D>__{do you buy all your murder weapons at home depot? god, you're butch.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{know what this is for? cutting boxes.}
<A>__{she takes a swipe at jennifer's crotch. jennifer instinctively clutches herself and rears up in defense. we see jennifer's mouth come down on needy's neck. needy shrieks as if bitten, but continues to strangle jennifer, straddling her and bearing down. jennifer's t shirt slides up to her armpits, exposing her breasts. for a moment, her eyes meet needy's and she grins. it's as if she has control over needy for a split second, sexual control... needy recoils and slashes jennifer's body left and right with the box cutter, marking a gory, oozing "x" on her torso.}
<C>__{needy }
<P>__{(hysterical)}
<D>__{cross out jennifer!}
<A>__{jennifer gasps, staring at her wounds in shock and disbelief. she looks back up at needy. a beat of silence. suddenly, the girls' bodies levitate rapidly toward the ceiling. they wrestle in a bloody, screaming airborne heap, their figures entwined. their bodies fall, collapsing back onto the bed with a thud. needy raises the box cutter and plunges it into jennifer's heart. blood geysers from the wound.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(choking)}
<D>__{my tit!}
<A>__{suddenly, the room is flooded with bright light, revealing a needy straddling jennifer's mutliated body. jennifer's breathing is a raspy death rattle. mrs. check, a middle aged woman in bad sleepwear and a worse perm rushes into the bedroom.}

<A>__{sure enough, the band is playing "land of a thousand dances." nearby, the flag team claps with gloved hands, picking up their flags for a choreographed stunt. jennifer steps forward in her flag team uniform, breathtakingly beautiful. she hoists her flag aloft, twirling it. time freezes as the flag unfurls.}
<C>__{needy v.o. }
<D>__{if you can believe it, that's jennifer. yeah, the same girl i iced with the box cutter. only back then, we were tight. sisters, practically. people found it hard to believe that a babe like jennifer would associate with a dork like me. but we'd been the wonder twins since we were practically preverbal. sandbox love never dies.}
<A>__{jennifer finishes her maneuver and waves to the stands. needy waves back at her excitedly from the bleachers, small and owlish with glasses and lank hair. chastity, a similarly geeky looking girl standing next to needy, rolls her eyes at this display of affection.}

<D>__{god, i can't wait until i'm old enough to get wasted. have you ever had peach schnapps?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{peach schnapps are excellent. they even taste good when they come out of your nose mid puke.}
<A>__{a teenage guy, craig, passes by and waves.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{hi jennifer. you look nice.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(without enthusiasm)}
<D>__{what up, craig.}
<A>__{she elbows needy and makes a gagging gesture.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{he thinks he's cute enough for me. no wonder he's in retard math.}
<A>__{jennifer pulls out a pack of camel wides and lights one awkwardly. needy notices ahmet from india, a foreign exchange student, standing by himself away from the crowd.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{hey, it's ahmet from india. the foreign exchange guy. he's all by himself.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i can't believe we traded a cute hockey player for that.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{he seems okay. he's got that cool elephant statue in his locker.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{do you think he's circumcised? i always wanted to try sea cucumber.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{ew!}
<A>__{roman duda saunters up to jennifer, swigging a bottle of beer. he snatches the pack of cigarettes away from her.}
<C>__{roman}
<D>__{you're smoking dicks now, jen?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{what? i like the wides.}
<A>__{she sticks the fat cigarette between her lips and inhales pointedly.}
<C>__{roman}
<D>__{i just bet you do. i should arrest you for possession under the legal age.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{arrest me, pfft! you're not even out of the academy yet, roman!}
<C>__{roman}
<D>__{two more months and i'm on the force for real. then i will be able to cuff you whenever the hell i want.}

<D>__{how will i wait that long?}

<D>__{not here, babe. i gotta keep my nose clean.}
<C>__{needy}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{look, there's the band!}
<A>__{a group of skinny indie rock boys are setting up their equipment on a pathetically tiny stage it's more like a dais. the lead singer has intense, spooky eyes, nearly obscured by a shock of hair. the locals, mostly good ol' boys, eye the band suspiciously.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{you can tell they're from the city.}
<C>__{roman}
<D>__{yeah, `cause they look like a bunch of faygos.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{you would think that. you're such a small time gomer. i wish we had more guys like that in devil's kettle. all stylish and shit.}
<A>__{needy nods dumbly. she stares at the band, awestruck.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{they look so so cool.}
<A>__{she gazes at the stage, hearing only the whistling rush of arctic air. in slow motion, the guitarist unsheathes his fender jaguar from its gig bag. he notices her staring and runs the tip of his tongue over his lips. needy swallows hard.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{hey, i think they need two groupies. come on! it'll be like almost famous! i will be penny lane and you can be the other girl.}
<A>__{she grabs needy's hand and enthusiastically tries to drag her toward the stage.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{don't be j.v., needy. they're just boys. morsels. we have all the power, don't you know that?}
<A>__{she plants her hands on needy's chest.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{these things are like smart bombs. point `em in the right direction and shit gets real.}
<A>__{needy shrugs free of jennifer's grasp and follows her reluctantly across the room. the lead singer of soft shoulder, nikolai wolf, is already striding forward to meet them at the lip of the stage. his gait is as smooth as his shock of dyed black hair.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{hi. um, we just really wanted to meet you or something? i'm jennifer check and this is my friend.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i'm nikolai wolf, and this is my band.}
<A>__{he reaches down and pumps jennifer's outstretched hand.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(awkward)}
<D>__{yeah! soft shoulder, right? i've heard you guys are super, super good at playing your instruments.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i hope we can live up to such...high praise.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{hey, if you don't mind me asking, why did you want to play all the way out here in devil's kettle? you live in the city, right?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{yeah. but i think it's so important to connect with our fans in rural areas. plus, the audiences in small towns really appreciate us.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{can i show you my appreciation right now?}
<A>__{needy looks at the floor, embarrassed. jennifer's voice scales up nervously.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{like, i will buy you a drink? i mean, i will see if i can get you a drink. they make this great 9 11 tribute shooter? it's red, white and blue, but you have to drink it fast or it gets all brownish.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<P>__{(grimacing)}
<D>__{mmm.}
<A>__{jennifer hurries off toward the bar. needy moves self consciously into a nearby corner, not wanting to continue the conversation with nikolai alone. a local plugs a loretta lynn tune into the jukebox, with a challenging stare at the band. a drunk couple begins two stepping in front of the stage. nikolai walks up to the guitar player, dirk, and pulls him aside. needy pricks up her ears and listens.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{dirk, what about her?}
<C>__{dirk}
<P>__{(gesturing to needy)}
<D>__{who, training bra jones?}
<A>__{needy looks offended.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{no, the hot one. the one who just walked away. she's it, man. she's exactly what we're looking for.}
<C>__{dirk}
<D>__{you're sure she's...}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{she's a kid. we're in god's country, man. everyone out here's a fundie bible banger. of course she's a virgin.}
<A>__{dirk hesitates.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{dirk, we didn't haul our asses out to this corn palace for nothing!}
<C>__{dirk}
<D>__{fine. okay. you know, i know i'm not "just the bassist." i'm a person who happens to play the bass guitar. and i would like some respect...}
<A>__{nikolai is already ignoring him. needy, alarmed, emerges from her hiding place and discreetly rushes over to the bar where jennifer is arguing with a jealous looking roman. he shakes his head in disgust and leaves the bar. jennifer walks over holding an ostentatious patriotic themed drink. she laughs when she sees needy's concerned expression.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{what? are you scared of rock stars too?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{those guys are rank, jen. just forget about it.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i think the singer wants me.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{only because he thinks you're a virgin. i heard them talking.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{yeah, right! i'm not even a backdoor virgin anymore, thanks to roman. by the way, that hurts. i couldn't even go to flags the next day. i had to stay home and sit on a bag of frozen peas.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{well, if nikolai wants innocent, i can do innocent. i will be little miss fucking sunshine.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{he's way too old for you.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{don't cock block me, needy.}
<A>__{piercing feedback signals the beginning of the set. nikolai takes the mic and smiles broadly.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{good evening, devil's lake.}
<A>__{someone in the back shouts "devil's kettle!"}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{sorry. anyway, we're soft shoulder. and we just want to make you happy.}
<A>__{he winks at jennifer. the band launch into the same intense, soaring song we heard in the cop car and the hole. jennifer's eyes never leave nikolai's. she's hypnotized, clinging to needy's arm. even the locals look charmed. suddenly, a lick of flame appears on the wood paneling next to the stage. needy is the first to notice. as she watches in horror, the fire is reflected in her glasses. the flames quickly climbs up to the ceiling and begin to blaze uncontrollably. people scream and scatter. someone ineffectually tries to throw a pitcher of beer on the fire. nikolai turns and sees the fire spreading. he and chas exchange glances. the bass player pitches his guitar aside and jumps off the stage, and the drummer abandons his kit. nikolai seems perfectly cool and composed as he watches from the stage...is he smiling? chaos. everyone is trying to get out of the bar at once, causing a stampede. a woman's clothes and hair catch fire and she falls to her knees. we see a beam fall from the roof, nearly killing ahmet from india. jennifer stands still in a dreamlike state.}
<C>__{needy}
<P>__{(to jennifer)}
<D>__{i know where to go!}
<A>__{needy grabs jennifer by the elbow and pulls her into the tiny bathroom. choking on smoke, they climb onto the sticker toilet (which now sports a giant soft shoulder sticker on the tank) and boost each other out the bathroom window. hundreds are still trapped inside, screaming.}
<L>__{exterior the carousel continuous}
<A>__{jennifer collapses in needy's arms, coughing. needy hugs her fiercely, almost romantically. she cups jennifer's flushed face and looks into her eyes.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(dazed)}
<D>__{it's so hot, needy. i think i'm on fire. oh god, i'm burning!}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{you're okay, i promise. you got burned worse when you wore that tin foil bikini to the beach. everything's fine.}
<A>__{suddenly, a hand clamps onto jennifer's shoulder. both girls jump. it's nikolai, his forehead creased with false concern.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{are you girls all right?}
<A>__{needy is less than thrilled to see him.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{we're great. maybe you should try to find your band?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{those guys? they were the first ones out the door. ran for the van like a bunch of marys. frankly, i'm ashamed of them.}
<A>__{needy narrows her eyes suspiciously. muffled screams rise up from the flame engulfed building. jennifer covers her ears and cowers, sweat rolling down her face.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{god, it feels like hell out here. come and hang with us in the van for a while, just until they hose this place down.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{okay...okay...}
<A>__{she slumps against nikolai's chest.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{you're in shock. here, drink this. you'll feel better.}
<A>__{he smoothly retrieves a plastic bottle of peach schnapps from his coat and holds it to jennifer's lips. she swigs it cooperatively, dribbling down her chin. needy blinks in disbelief at the coincidence.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{aren't you a little freaked out about this? what about all your stuff? it's probably melting, and when you get to the next stop you'll have to do like, a crappy acoustic set! nobody likes that.}

<C>__{needy}
<D>__{why? why should we? we have the malibu. let's just get out of here. we can go to el ojo and get northwoods nachos with extra badger sauce! please? i'm starving.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{needy, stop it. just stop it!}
<A>__{she defiantly follows nikolai toward the white van, which is parked a suspiciously safe distance from the bar. needy staggers after them slowly, watching. behind needy, the bar explodes. screams. flames. silence. needy doesn't even look back as she watches jennifer get into the van. ash drifts into her hair like snowflakes. nikolai takes off his shirt as he enters the van, revealing his slick, muscled white torso.}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{i watched her get into that van and i knew something awful was going to happen. but for some reason, i felt drawn toward them. toward him. he was pale and twisted and evil, like this petrified tree i saw when i was a kid.}

<A>__{needy stumbles into her bedroom, overwhelmed. her clothes are smoke damaged and her cheeks are sooty. she grabs her cheap, taped up cell phone and dials chip's number shakily.}

<C>__{needy}
<D>__{um, jennifer?}
<A>__{jennifer says nothing and continues to smile with blood tinged teeth.}
<C>__{needy }

<P>__{(trembling)}
<D>__{j jen?}
<A>__{jennifer lets out a horrifying banshee scream, wailing at the top of her lungs. she vomits a torrent of evil looking black bile all over herself and needy and staggers wildly down the hallway. the bloody black bile hits the wall, splashing a framed school portrait of needy. needy screams and watches in horror as it slides down the wall. the bile has hundred of tiny spines sticking out of it, like little porcupine needles, and it appears to move by itself, oozing across the linoleum, creeping into the corners. it's truly revolting. needy grabs jennifer blindly and claps a hand over her mouth. jennifer falls to her knees, her screams turning to jagged, insane laughter. needy tries to run, but jennifer grabs her and throws her against the wall with superhuman force, pinning her. jennifer slowly, tantalizingly brushes her face against needy's hair, her earlobe. needy doesn't move a muscle. jennifer's hand slides up needy's ribcage. she presses her lips against needy's carotid artery. we hear needy's blood pumping, swishing.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{are you scared?}
<A>__{needy nods. jennifer parts her lips. then suddenly, she stops and pulls away, pushing needy to the floor. jennifer bolts out the front door and takes off running down the street. needy is motionless for a moment, then stumbles toward the doorway.}
