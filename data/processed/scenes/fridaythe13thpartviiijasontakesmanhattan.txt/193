<L>__{interior times square diner night}
<A>__{filled with noise, smoke and derelicts. a tough, redheaded waitress with a thick brooklyn accent stands behind the countertop, a wall of mirrors behind her. the front door bangs open with the entrance of sean and rennie, rushing up to the waitress.}
<C>__{sean}
<P>__{(out of breath)}
<D>__{you have to call the police...}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{please, hurry...}
<A>__{a telephone sits right next to her, but this is new york.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{there's a pay phone in back.}
<A>__{they start to run.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{...but it's broken.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{you don't understand there's a maniac trying to kill us!!!}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(blase)}
<D>__{welcome to new york.}
<A>__{there's no time for further response as jason crashes through the diner door, mowing a path straight towards them. sean and rennie run out the back as the waitress eyes jason with complete disbelief.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{as the burly chef comes out to confront him. jason flings}
<B>__{him head first into the jukebox. the waitress}
<A>__{picks up the telephone, really pissed off.}
<B>__{a biker}
<A>__{climbs off his counter stool, revealing a huge bowie knife. jason plows straight for him and the biker stabs jason in the heart. jason has little reaction, pulling it out, tossing it aside. the biker's face goes wan, backing away.}
<B>__{the waitress}
<A>__{stops in mid dial. fear is starting to register now.}
<B>__{jason}
<A>__{lifts the very large man and effortlessly heaves him into}
<B>__{the mirror over the counter. the waitress}
<A>__{feels the phone receiver slipping from her grasp, her mouth trembling. she backs away from the beast as far as she can. jason has no time to waste on her, trampling out the back after rennie and sean as the other patrons shrink from him.}
