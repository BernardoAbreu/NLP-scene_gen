<A>__{the bus lurches forward, rumbles through the gates. andy gazes around, swallowed by prison walls.}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{on the outside, he'd been vice president of a large portland bank. good work for a man as young as he was, when you consider how conservative banks were back then.}
<C>__{tower guard}
<D>__{all clear!}
<A>__{guards approach the bus with carbines. the door jerks open. the new fish disembark, chained together single file, blinking sourly at their surroundings. andy stumbles against the man in front of him, almost drags him down. byron hadley, captain of the guard, slams his baton into andy's back. andy goes to his knees, gasping in pain. jeers and shouts from the spectators.}

<C>__{red}
<D>__{that's five cigarettes on fat ass. any takers?}
<A>__{more hands go up. andy and the others are paraded along, forced by their chains to take tiny baby steps, flinching under the barrage of jeers and shouts. the old timers are shaking the fence, trying to make the newcomers shit their pants. some of the new fish shout back, but mostly they look terrified. especially andy.}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{i must admit i didn't think much of andy first time i laid eyes on him. he might'a been important on the outside, but in here he was just a little turd in prison grays. looked like a stiff breeze could blow him over. that was my first impression of the man.}
