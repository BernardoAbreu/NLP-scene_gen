<A>__{he starts into mary's car. she looks at him, in near panic, wanting to skip the whole thing. torn, wondering if the presence of the patrolman doesn't negate the value of changing cars, wondering how she can get away, wondering if she'll be followed, or if the patrolman will go away if she does stay here. all these panic fears rush her mind and she can do nothing. the car dealer has driven her car into the garage. she stands in the middle of the lot, feeling like a shooting target. she looks toward the garage. the garage mary's pov (day) mary's car is in it.}
