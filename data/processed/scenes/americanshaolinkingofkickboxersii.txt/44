<A>__{drew walks behind the other disciples, who are lining up to get their robes. as he takes his place in line, a monk comes up to take drew's backpack. drew resists, and a tug of war ensues.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{what are you doing, man?}
<C>__{monk}
<D>__{you must surrender this.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{no way, man! get your own...}
<A>__{the drill sergeant sees the scuffle and walks over.}
<C>__{d.s.}
<D>__{it is unseemly to argue like this. take the backpack into the sleeping quarters.}
<P>__{(to drew)}
<D>__{do not cling to material things it is not good for your soul.}
<A>__{he walks away, and drew reluctantly gives up his backpack. drew lines back up, and is about to get his robes, when gao slides over and takes them from him. drew immediately shoves him and tries to grab the robes back. gao smiles and moves away, holding the robes up and away from drew. drew is pissed and ready to go after gao. before he can, however, li, another disciple, grabs another set of robes from the table and gives it to drew, pulling him away from the confrontation.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{what's with that guy?}
<C>__{li}
<D>__{watch out for gao. he's trouble.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{really? i hadn't noticed... why'd they let him in, anyway?}
<C>__{li}
<D>__{who knows? maybe for the challenge?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{no, that was me...}
<A>__{they both smile and walk off.}
