<L>__{interior lobby insurance building evening}
<A>__{we are close on the building directory. listed under personnel is j.d. sheldrake, director, and just below that a man's hand is inserting the name c.c. baxter in the slot marked asst. director. the lettering is complete except for the final r. camera pulls back to reveal the sign painter we saw earlier, working on the directory. watching him is bud. he is wearing his chesterfield and bowler, and still has a slight welt under his left eye. it is after six o'clock, and there is very little activity in the lobby. fran, wearing her coat over street clothes, approaches from the direction of the elevators, stops when she sees bud.}
<C>__{fran}

<C>__{bud}
<D>__{for that matter, you were wrong about me, too. what you said about those who take and those who get took? well, mr. sheldrake wasn't using me i was using him. see?}
<P>__{(indicating his name on directory)}
<D>__{last month i was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor now i'm on the twenty seventh floor, paneled office, three windows so it all worked out fine we're both getting what we want.}

<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{aren't you meeting mr. sheldrake?}

<D>__{that's very wise.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{good night, mr. baxter.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{good night, miss kubelik.}
<A>__{fran walks toward the revolving doors. bud watches her for a moment, then strides briskly across the lobby toward the newsstand. he goes right past the waiting brunette, stops in front of a rack of pocket books, examines the merchandise. a man now comes out of a phone booth, joins the waiting brunette, and they go off together. bud picks out a couple of paperbacks, pays the clerk behind the counter. stuffing a book into each coat pocket, he moves slowly toward the revolving doors.}
