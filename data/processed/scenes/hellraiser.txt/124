<L>__{interior a small restaurant evening}
<A>__{kirsty and larry are sitting eating a meal together, in an intimate restaurant. larry has little appetite, to judge by his plate. he looks as if he hasn't slept for several nights. kirsty, by contrast, is sparkling}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{... maybe we should never have come back.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{maybe you should give it some time.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i guess.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(skirting her real feelings)}
<D>__{she's not like mom. she's ... i don't know ... moody. i thought that was what you liked about her.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you don't like her at all do you?}
<A>__{the straight forward question silences kirsty for a moment. she wants to be delicate with her father's feelings, but honest at the same time.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{i don't know her. she's so ... sealed up.}
<A>__{larry's face is full of the desire for reassurance. kirsty tries to offer it.}
<D>__{if you love her she must be worth loving. just give me some time.}
<A>__{larry nods, a weak smile on his face}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{she doesn't even want to leave the house.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{it's like she's waiting for something.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i don't know. i don't know. it's beyond me.}
<A>__{a silence.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(hesitant)}
<D>__{would you ... maybe call round sometime? try to make friends.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{maybe all she needs is some company.}
