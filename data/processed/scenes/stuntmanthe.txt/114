<A>__{it is harvey standing in the doorway with nina.}
<C>__{harvey}
<P>__{(to eli)}
<D>__{hey chief, ya lookin' for me?}
<A>__{nina tries to peer over the heads of the crowd, pushing into the room. cameron steps toward her without thinking. he wants her out of there.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{what's happening? what's going on?}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(joking)}
<D>__{look who's here! nina, we need you. still got your makeup on?}
<A>__{nina, who by now has seen what's happening, laughs.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{that's a daring touch, raymond! the rowboat. terribly symbolic.}
<A>__{there is general laughter, but not shared by cameron. he surprisingly finds himself angry at nina's presence here and everyone's easy familiarity toward her. she sees cameron and eli through the smokey dimness and works her way toward them smiling. eli puts his arms about her shouting over the din.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(kidding her)}
<D>__{just like the old days, huh kid? remember the sunglasses and garter belts back when we got our start? make you nostalgic?}
<A>__{more laughter. nina turns to cameron.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{hi lancelot. what's a nice boy like you doing in a place like this? going to rescue the maiden from the boat?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{he just asked if he could do the rowing. didn't you, kid?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{having fun with me, aren't you? it's eli's potty training class. show little lucky the pretty lady. make dirt on the pretty lady. watch little lucky puke. trouble with you is you think the whole world is your own personal crapper.}
<P>__{(cameron starts to exit)}
<D>__{have yourself a time...just wallow around in it, man. watching you makes me feel like mr. clean.}
<A>__{cameron storms out in a rage. eli watches with a thoughtful smile. sam, who has witnessed the outburst, turns to eli, furious:}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{...goddamn little prudish bastard!}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{no more than you and me...it's the human condition. we just hide it better.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{...are you kidding?...if that guy in the rowboat was a marine sticking a bayonet in her instead of a cock, that uptight son of a bitch would have saluted.}
<A>__{eli starts laughing.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{fucking fascist. what are you laughing at?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's just...that girl in the rowboat, she looks exactly like your daughter, jennifer.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(outraged)}
<D>__{goddamn you, eli. that's not funny!}
<A>__{he grabs eli by the shirt front, cocking his fist.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(laughing and wrestling)}
<D>__{get 'em, sam! sic 'em! kill 'em, boy! that's my uptight killie doggie...}
<A>__{sam's anger fades to a sheepish grin, realizing he's fallen into eli's trap. where his daughter is concerned, he's just as prudish as cameron. eli snaps an affectionate headlock around sam's neck.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{son of a bitch.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(still laughing)}
<D>__{see what i mean? old victoria's still got us all by the balls. god save the queen!...only difference is, we like to make movies about it.}
<A>__{with hardly a pause, he turns.}
<C>__{eli }
<D>__{harvey, dailies at six o'clock tomorrow morning. we're shooting at seven.}
<A>__{rubbing his hands together (the old pro taking over), he starts pushing his way through the crowd.}
<C>__{eli }
<D>__{all right now, let's put a little bit of class into this production!}
<A>__{he elbows his way to center stage.}
