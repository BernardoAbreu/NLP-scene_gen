<L>__{interior karen's parent's bedroom}
<A>__{karen opens the door. what she thought she was going to see was bad enough but this is worse: freddy krueger is in the middle of the room. in front of him is a giant human sized version of an inflatable punching doll, the kind little kids hit that keep bouncing back. but the doll doesn't have the image of a clown on it. it's a flattened wrapped around version of karen's mother, a pitiful beat up look on her plastic face. freddy smacks the doll it falls to the floor and just bounces back up. and now the face on it has a new bruise. thwack! he hits it again, cackling with glee. swoop, bounce. more bruises develop. krueger looks at karen.}

<D>__{welcome to romper room!}
<A>__{bap! booooing! the face on the punching doll changes again, it's even sadder now. and it's looking at karen.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{why are you doing this?}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{don't you remember?}
<A>__{zing! krueger whips up his finger knives. swoop! he rips them through the plastic doll. sisssssssss. the doll starts to deflate. skreeeeeeeee. the escaping air sounding like a human scream. freddy turns to karen. and a hand reaches out from behind her and pulls her out of the room.}
