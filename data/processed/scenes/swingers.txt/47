<C>__{trent}
<D>__{she really didn't do it for me, baby. how'd you like dorothy?}
<C>__{mike}

<C>__{mike}
<D>__{yeah, a good friend.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{baby, you take your self out of the game. you start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i just don't think she liked me in that way.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{baby, you're so money you don't even know it.}
<C>__{mike}

<C>__{trent}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i was younger... it was college. you didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. you screw chicks you have no business being with. they're young, they don't know any better.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{that's just plain silly. your self esteem is just low because she's with someone else. but thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. it's no good, man. you gotta get out there. the ladies want to love you, baby.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i just need some time...}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{why? so you can beat yourself up? sitting around in that stuffy apartment. it's just plain bad for you, man. it's depressing. you've come so far. remember the first week? after she told you? you couldn't even eat.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{don't remind me.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{you just sat around drinking orange juice. now look at you. look how far you've come in just a few months. you got that part in that movie...}

<C>__{mike}
<D>__{he drives a carriage.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{what?!?}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i hear he drives a carriage around central park or something.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{please. and you're sweating him ? you're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i hear she's getting real fat.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you . sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. trust me, mikey, you're better off.}
<A>__{trent cranks some frank. "you make me feel so young". mike is finally, genuinely, smiling. he turns down the music enough to talk.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i'm gonna try. i'm really gonna try.}
