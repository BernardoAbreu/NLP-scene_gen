<L>__{interior of cabin night}
<A>__{rocklin has reached the entrance unheard, and silently watches the strange figure, its back to him, now headed for the fireplace with his saddlebag, taken from the bunk. he sees the intruder start emptying his saddlebag on the bench in the light of the fire. he sees him suddenly stop and pick up something hidden from his view. at that instant, rocklin slams the door shut. the intruder whirls around. it is arly tense and now defiant. the two regard each other like vicious animals in the same cage. arly's heart is pounding, but you would never know it. and now rocklin, his gun away, starts closing in, slowly but arly holds her ground her eyes never leaving his. when rocklin reaches arly, he takes her one hand from behind her back, and slowly forcing it up sees what is obviously clara's letter in her tightly clenched fist. he tries to open her hand, and arly, knowing she lacks the strength to prevent it, suddenly whips out a knife with her free hand. but that quick, rocklin grabs the knife hand, and without any apparent effort, wrenches it free of her grasp and tosses it across the room, where it lands on the bunk. arly relaxes her grip on the letter meanwhile, and rocklin gets it, and tears it very deliberately, letting the pieces fall at her feet. he turns his back on her now, going over to his hat on the floor. arly is furious in her helplessness and humiliation. and rocklin's smug manner isn't helping any. he picks up his hat and, glancing at arly, puts his finger once more through the bullet holes.}

<P>__{(right back at him)}
<D>__{you think i did that?}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{sure to draw us away from here.}
<P>__{(looks at his hat)}
<D>__{you know, you cut it mighty close good thing i ain't got brains enough to fill it.}
<A>__{rocklin puts his hat on. he sees arly looking down at the torn letter.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(suppressing smile)}
<D>__{too bad you had to come 'way up here through that storm for nothin'.}
<C>__{arly}
<P>__{(affectedly)}
<D>__{i haven't minded a bit }
<P>__{(harshly)}
<D>__{ because i came up to fire you.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{oh }
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{i see.}
<A>__{rocklin goes toward the bunk with his saddlebag.}
<C>__{arly}
<D>__{get out of here get off the santee and don't ever come back.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{mind if i wait for dave? he ought to be along any minute be funny if he winged that shadow of yours.}
<C>__{arly}
<D>__{if you mean juan you're loco. he's not even up here.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(mildly surprised)}
<D>__{you came up alone?}
<C>__{arly}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(half believing her)}
<D>__{then who was that we took out after?}
<C>__{arly}
<D>__{the man who shot at you.}
<A>__{rocklin sits on the bunk and casually picks up arly's knife.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{who was he?}
<C>__{arly}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{you mean you won't tell.}
<C>__{arly}
<D>__{i mean i don't know why should i lie to you?}
<A>__{that last from arly brings a kind of smile to rocklin's face a smile that says in effect "are you kidding?" he gets up from the bunk to go to the door, and finding himself still holding arly's knife, throws it back to her in a seemingly casual manner. it passes too close to arly for comfort and, rocklin just opening the door, gets the knife right back that close to his ear he feels the breeze. he looks at it, quivering in the door. then, moving to arly in what could be construed as a threatening manner, he takes her in his arms and kisses her. arly is caught completely unaware. rocklin's action disarms her. but it is, after all, what she really wants, so before the kiss ends, arly's arms slowly entwine themselves around rocklin's neck. in the middle of the kiss rocklin gently but forcefully takes her arms from around his neck and puts her from him.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{i guess you forgot you jes' fired me.}
<A>__{he goes to the bunk picks up his saddlebag, coat, etc., and starts for the door. arly has been silently watching.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(turning near the open door)}
<D>__{so long.}
<A>__{dave's voice is heard just outside the cabin door.}
<C>__{dave's voice}
<D>__{hey, rock }
<A>__{dave now rushes through the door, puffing and excited.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{ he got away but guess what, i }
<A>__{he sees arly and pulls up abruptly.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(slowly to dave)}
<D>__{you guess }
<A>__{rocklin gives arly a disparaging side glance and starts out.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(to dave, who is trying to figure things out)}
<D>__{come on.}
