<L>__{exterior tower bridge walkway day}
<A>__{a look between them and then it's on. holmes grabs a short section of wooden batten out of the railing. flimsy, no match for the sword which is immediately apparent as blackwood comes in, slashes, chops six inches off the batten.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{i planned to kill a handful of senile old men to make this empire strong... but now because of you thousands are going to die.}
<A>__{holmes is on the defensive throughout, but, as before, his target is the cylinder first, blackwood second, self defense third.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{all i have to do is break this cylinder. the wind will do the rest. and you'll be the first.}
<A>__{the two men continue their swordfight: holmes grabs some rope hanging from the scaffolding above and swings off the bridge. blackwood steps to the edge with his sword out, awaiting holmes. holmes swings towards the blade and then pushes off the bridge once again to avoid it. holmes swings back onto the bridge a few feet away from blackwood. he lands, whips off his scarf and twirls it around blackwood's arm, binding them together. they continue to spar, now bound. blackwood snarls, mounts a frenzied attack, which holmes simply tries to survive. the two men finally part, with holmes cast off towards the end of the bridge. blackwood smiles. he grabs holmes' gun (which blackwood knocked from irene's hand earlier). blackwood fires at holmes. holmes quickly ducks. the bullet misses him, but hits a bucket twirling above his head. a black liquid (tar) begins to pour out in a circle around him. holmes turns, as if to flee (not that there's anywhere to go) his eyes lock on to something. he looks back to blackwood. holmes kicks a huge scaffolding plank, which falls whipping a coil of rope across the floor, hooking blackwood around his ankle. blackwood is dragged down the walkway by the weight of the falling plank, pulled toward the edge. holmes grabs the cylinders as blackwood passes. blackwood digs his fingers into a gap, screeching to a painful halt. his fingers are white from strain. holmes remains cool.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{there was never any magic. only conjuring tricks.}
<A>__{above holmes: the raven starts pecking at a rope.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{the simplest involved paying people off, like the prison guard...}
<A>__{holmes looks over the edge of the walkway. he sees the plank swinging dangerously in the storm. blackwood strains desperately to hold on. as holmes steps closer we intercut : with relevant flashbacks.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(guard choking payoff)}
<D>__{who pretended to be possessed outside your cell. your reputation and your jailers' fear did the rest.}
<P>__{(burial ground licking rocks)}
<D>__{others required more elaborate preparation, like the sandstone slab that covered your tomb. you had it broken before your burial then put back together using a mild adhesive. an ancient egyptian recipe i believe a mixture of egg and honey. designed to be washed away by the rain or eaten by animals.}
<P>__{(bath reordon flashback)}
<D>__{arranging for your father to drown in his own bathtub required more modern science. very clever of reordon to find a paralytic that was activated by the combination of copper and water and was therefore undetectable once the bath water was drained.}
<C>__{holmes }
<D>__{that might have been quite challenging had he not also tested it on some unfortunate amphibians.}
<P>__{(standish in rain }
<D>__{pulling the trigger }
<P>__{wharf explosion)}
<D>__{the death of standish was a real mystery, until you used the same compound to blow up the wharf. an odorless, tasteless, flammable liquid yet it burned with an unusual pinkish hue. did standish mistake it for rain as he entered your temple? all it took was a spark. a simple rigged bullet in his gun. ingenious.}
<P>__{(parliament flask ceremony, dev ice)}
<D>__{like all great performers you saved your piece de resistance for the end. had it worked, your followers in parliament would have watched unharmed as their colleagues were dying around them. they didn't know that you had given them the antidote at one of your ceremonies i suspect. instead, they would have believed it was magic and that you harnessed the ultimate power.}
<B>__{end flashbacks.}
<A>__{blackwood struggles to hold on, he loses his grip for a second and is dragged back toward the precipice. wind whips harder. holmes doesn't notice: the raven's rope snaps, starting a slow, subtle domino effect in b.g.: a bucket drops, hits a row of standing timbers. the timbers start to topple. (note: each time one object strikes another, we hear a faint musical note moving up the same pentatonic scale that holmes played earlier for his flies.)}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you hated your father and the other members of the temple of the four orders for what they did to you. how satisfying it must have been to use their own system against them.}
<A>__{in b.g.: we see the slow, inexorable dominoes continue to fall. the last timber falls over the edge, lands on a rope. the rope yanks down a crane, the crane swings, strikes another crane...}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{cut me loose, holmes!}
<A>__{blackwood's eyes are full of fear. holmes thoughtfully looks out at the angry storm, the atmosphere electric and dangerous. holmes gives the slightest hint of a smile.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you better hope that it's nothing more than superstition as you performed all the rituals perfectly.}
<A>__{holmes looks around at the gathering storm. blackwood can hold on no longer. he screams as he releases his grip and is torn down the walkway at breakneck speed. quick as a snake, holmes grabs a workman's ax placed on the side and hurls it at his feet, cutting the rope. blackwood's imminent death is brought suddenly to a halt. the storm grows in ferocity. holmes bends down, blackwood is on his knees, cowed.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{first, the world will see you for what you are. then you will hang... properly this time.}
<A>__{blackwood looks up. crack! the crane dislodges a metal girder, which misses holmes by inches as it crashes through the floorboards blackwood smirks.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{we'll see about that shall we. it's a long journey from here to the rope.}
<A>__{creak. holmes looks up. blackwood looks up.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{we'll see about that shall we.}
<A>__{bang! the top of the crane crashes down. the wooden infrastructure supporting blackwood falls away. sending blackwood falling into a lattice of hanging chains below. blackwood screams as the chains begin to snap off one by one. he falls farther... and farther... and finally snap! the last chain catches, tightens around blackwood's neck, killing him instantly. blackwood dangles on the rusty chain, hanged like a common man after all, with tower bridge as his gibbet. holmes just stands there, stunned. he looks out to see: the raven flying away, a silhouette against the stormy sky. the bird flaps its wings, disappearing into a cloud. his brow furrows. perhaps there really are some things that cannot be explained. holmes looks over the side of the bridge, sees: irene is awkwardly splayed on the lower level. she appears to be dead, possibly a small trickle of blood is coming out of her mouth. holmes moves down to her. he takes her hand.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{oh, irene...}
<A>__{his fingers move to take her pulse. her eyes pop open. irene makes a quick move: she tries to cuff him. but this time, holmes is ready for it: he reverses the move, cuffing her instead. he takes a seat next to her. they sit there for a beat, an odd lovers' moment looking out over the thames.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{it looks like rain.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{we've still got a moment.}
<A>__{a bit of a smile and break.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{you were right, he is a professor. moriarty. key's in the watch pocket.}
<A>__{holmes reaches over to grab the key. their faces close, near a kiss. holmes drops the keys down the top of her shirt (just as she dropped them down his pants). he snatches the diamond from around her neck, turns and walks away. she smiles, calls out:}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{you'll miss me, sherlock.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{sadly, yes.}
<A>__{holmes walks away, pauses to pick up watson's sword stick, keeps walking. at the end of the top of the stairs. holmes hands the cylinder to one of the policemen.}
