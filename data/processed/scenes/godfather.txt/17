<B>__{young couple.}
<C>__{luca }
<D>__{don corleone...}
<A>__{the don turns to the stiffly formal luca, and he moves forward to kiss his hand. he takes the envelope from his jacket, holds it out, but does not release it until he makes a formal speech.}
<C>__{luca}
<P>__{(with difficulty)}
<D>__{don corleone...i am honored, and grateful...that you invited me to your home...on the wedding day of your...daughter. may their first child...be a masculine child. i pledge my never ending loyalty.}
<P>__{(he offers the envelope)}
<D>__{for your daughter's bridal purse.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{thank you, luca, my most valued friend.}
<A>__{the don takes it, and then luca's hand, which he squeezes so tightly we might imagine it to be painful.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{let me leave you, don corleone. i know you are busy.}
<A>__{he turns, almost an about face, and leaves the study with the same formality he entered with. don corleone breathes more easily, and gives the thick envelope to hagen.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{i'm sure it's the most generous gift today.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{the senator called apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand. also, some of the judges...they've all sent gifts. and another call from virgil sollozzo.}
<A>__{don corleone is not pleased.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{the action is narcotics. sollozzo has contacts in turkey for the poppy, in sicily for the plants to process down to morphine or up to heroin. also he has access to this country. he's coming to us for financial help, and some sort of immunity from the law. for that we get a piece of the action, i couldn't find out how much. sollozzo is vouched for by the tattaglia family, and they may have a piece of the action. they call sollozzo the turk. he's spent a lot of time in turkey and is suppose to have a turkish wife and kids. he's suppose to be very quick with the knife, or was, when he was younger. only in matters of business and with some reasonable complainterior also he has an american wife and three children and he is a good family man.}

<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{and with prison record.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{two terms; one in italy, one in the united states. he's known to the government as a top narcotics man. that could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.}

<C>__{don corleone}

<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{what that? it sounds like johnny.}
