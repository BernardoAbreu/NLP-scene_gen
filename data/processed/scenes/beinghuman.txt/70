<A>__{hector and beatrice have packed their few belongings into a shoulder bag. they turn out of the farmyard and walk down the main track. hector catches a last glimpse of the priest being helped onto the back of a horse, behind a soldier. he is ridden off in the opposite direction with the rest of the troop. other battles lie ahead to be blessed, and more battered bodies requiring comfort. hector and beatrice are enjoying the first pulse quickening flush of their intimacy, and the thrill of knowing it will go further. they chatter freely, despite not sharing a language.}
