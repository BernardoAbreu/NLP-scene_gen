<D>__{that's it, richard parker. it's for you.}
<A>__{pi holds the lamb through the bars, the tiger walks slowly down the hallway, regarding pi with a detached curiosity, as unthreatening in his manner as a large housecat. pi begins trembling from sheer excitement. he doesn't hear the approach of uneven footsteps father appears, followed by ravi. just as richard parker approaches the offering.}

<D>__{no!!!}
<A>__{father yanks pi violently away from the cage, wrenching pi's hand through the bars. richard parker, startled, raises his head, hissing. he turns and bounds back out through the gate at the other end of the hallway, disappearing into the exhibit area. father spins pi around and shoves him against the wall.}
