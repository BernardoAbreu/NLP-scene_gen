<A>__{the explosion echoes behind them. the men pull along. their heads jerk in circles, searching into the blackness. some twenty yards to their rear something swooshes down, severing the line. the wind sends the men tumbling along the ice. childs loosens the line and is blown away, rolling out of sight. macready and nauls have lost their torches. they pull feverishly along the ground trying to make it to the compound. the screeching closes in behind them. macready loses his grip on the rope and is blown toward the main building. he crawls along looking for an opening. nauls slides near the outside entrance to the dog kennel. he climbs down through the open stairwell.}
