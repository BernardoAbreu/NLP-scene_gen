<L>__{interior "the side pocket" pool hall night}
<A>__{a dozen tables... smells of blue chalk and whiskey... the juke box cranked... we take it to the back of the joint ... where kip, and tumbler and mirror man are knocking a rack... freb sits nearby, with a few badly made up girls...}
<C>__{tumbler}
<D>__{... so ... it's my new move ... it's called "the stranger." what i do is, i sit on my hand for 10 minutes. till it falls asleep. till it's good and numb. no feeling. and then i jerk off.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{that's disgusting }
<C>__{freb}
<D>__{what's the point, man ?}
<C>__{tumbler}
<D>__{cos it's like you're bein' done by a stranger ... it rocks ... it's the power move of the new millennium...}
<A>__{he sinks another ball. a kid, 15, toby comes up to them.}
<C>__{toby}

<D>__{what do you want, shithead?}
<C>__{toby}

<C>__{kip}
<D>__{no ... and they won't take my calls ...}
<C>__{freb}
<D>__{what does that mean ?}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{it ain't what you'd call a "good sign"}
<A>__{he groks their fear...}
<C>__{kip }
<D>__{look we managed to get 13 in a week. we just gotta step it up ...}
<C>__{freb}
<D>__{but we only got till friday. that's four days. and we lost the 13. so's we gotta start over ...}
<A>__{kip looks at him...}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{that, too ...}
<P>__{(off of freb's look of fright)}
<D>__{don't sweat it, freb. we're cool.}
<A>__{angle the front door. for memphis has entered. he clocks the room. sees them at the rear ... walks back}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{it can be done, man. we just gotta step it up... it's a challenge ...}
<C>__{mirror man}
<D>__{the challenge is not to get our nuts cut off and shoved down our throats ...}
<C>__{tumbler}
<D>__{can i help you, pal ?}
<A>__{and kip looks up ... to see memphis there ...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{hey, kip ...}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{hello, memphis }
<C>__{tumbler}
<D>__{"memphis?" you're memphis?}

<D>__{memphis. holy shit. it's an honor, man }
<A>__{and he pumps his hand... memphis continues to stare at kip}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{it's good to see ya, man. you changed your look }
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{you, too}
<A>__{hold the stare... the others are excited...}
<C>__{freb}
<D>__{what are you doing back, memphis?}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{little visit. check on the family.}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{it's nice to see ya, man }

<D>__{sure. hey, toby. you grew up}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yeah, i'm cool ...}
<A>__{and memphis turns back to kip, who's picked up a pool cue.}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{who's got next game ?}
<A>__{and he makes to rack 'em up ... then:}
<C>__{mirror man}
<D>__{i get it. you ain't gotta be a genius: memphis come back to save our bacon!}
<C>__{tumbler}
<D>__{shut up, mirror man }
<C>__{freb}
<D>__{izzat true? you come back to save our bacon?}
<C>__{mirror man}
<D>__{of course it's true. he come to save his brother's dangling ass }
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{that can't be it. cos we don't need saving}
<C>__{freb}
<D>__{we don't ?}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{he give you an advance ?}
<C>__{mirror man}
<D>__{hell, yeah. ten larger man}
<A>__{kip shoots him a look... as if he's spoken out of turn ...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{you just give 'im back the money. all's well...}
<A>__{the others look glum... kip laughs ... long and hard...}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{"give lim back the money." "give 'im back the money..." be nice. if only we didn't drink the money. and smoke the money. and buy nikes with the money. and sony play stations with the money. and dirty girls with the money...}
<A>__{and kip sinks a ball ... memphis looks at the others ... they nod... it's true ... the money's gone ...}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{but don't worry, man. things are all sweetness and light here...}
<C>__{tumbler}
<D>__{things are all leafy and suburban ...}
<C>__{mirror man}
<D>__{the hell they are }
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{sure they are. although we do appreciate the gesture, memphis. but we do got it handled... and it was nice to see you }
<A>__{memphis nods ... looks at all of them... smiles ... and then reaches out, grabbing kip by the collar, yanking him to his feet and in close, nose to nose ...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{you listen to me, baby brother. you fancy yourself some reat neat tough guy scumbum, well, woop tee doo, little puppy with a poundcake. but i remember the days when you used to steal my colorforms and eat 'em... so you can't stop me from saving your "dangling ass' if that's what i feel like doing...}
<A>__{and with that, he shoves kip back down into his seat, toppling the table, bottles and glasses crashing... and barrels away from them, the crowd parting like a wound... kip's crew left stunned, flustered, and maybe a bit impressed...}
<C>__{tumbler}
<D>__{damn... homeboy's on the dazzle ...}
<A>__{and, off of kip's furious look, we cut to:}
