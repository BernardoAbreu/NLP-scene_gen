<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior rock outcropping day}
<A>__{a brilliant african sun beats down on the veldt below. on the rock, a seven year old pk sits looking somewhat sadly over the landscape. a long shadow covers him. the click of a camera is heard. pk turns, shielding his eyes with his hand against the glare of the sun to a tall, white haired figure, shirtless, in hiking boots and kneesocks, holding a box camera.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{ja. perfect. you will excuse me, please.}
<A>__{doc, speaking in german accented english, moves off from the sun's glare down to pk's level. on his back is a knapsack with a cactus sticking out of it.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{this i do not normally without permission do, ja? but to catch the expression. after all, it is the expression that is important. ja? without the expression the human being is just a lump of meat. you have some problems, i think. i am professor karl von vollensteen.}
<A>__{doc clicks his heels together and bows his head slightly.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{i'm p.k.}
<A>__{he holds out his hand. doc takes it.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{such a young person with such an old expression. i think we can be friends. ja?}
<A>__{eighteen year old pk narrates.}
<C>__{pk }
<D>__{that was how i met doc, as he insisted i call him. a chance meeting between a directionless seven year old boy and an old german professor out collecting cacti on the african bush veldt.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{so began my education.}
<A>__{doc and pk walk the veldt across craggy mountain trails, down dry river beds, through the jungle, always collecting cacti and aloe samples, doc always talking, always explaining.}
<C>__{pk }
<D>__{doc believed the brain had two functions and that the south african public school system unfortunately dealt with only one.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{the brain, p.k., has two functions. it is the best reference library ever, which is a good thing to have. ja? but also from it comes original thought. in school you will get all filled up with the facts. here your brain will learn where to look, how to look, how to think. and then you will have for yourself all the brains that have ever been.}
<A>__{doc and pk sit high up. pk watches the endless animal migration below while doc points things out across the landscape.}
<C>__{pk }
<D>__{doc knew everything. he had a love of learning. but his real passion was centered around two things music and cacti.}
