<L>__{into shot, snapping a handcuff onto his wrist.}
<B>__{boyle}
<A>__{looks up, astonished, to find himself right in the grinning face of dr. lecter who just as quickly rolls sideways, and snaps }
<B>__{the other cuff}
<A>__{around the bolted leg of the table. and suddenly all natural sound and motion are suspended, as the music soars much louder, each separate note of it now echoing distinctly, and we see... various angles each blurring into stop action pembry starting into the cell, reaching for his riot baton... dr. lecter smashing against the cell door, driving it into pembry, pinning him across the chest, against the door frame... boyle, on one knee on the floor, digging desperately in his pants pocket for his handcuff key... pembry's hand, mashed against his body by the door, as he strains frantically to reach the baton at his waist... pembry's eyes, widening in horror as he stares at... dr. lecter's bared teeth, flashing towards him... dr. lecter gripping pembry's face in his jaws, shaking it like a dog shakes a rat... boyle finding his key, but in his terror dropping it... dr. lecter yanking the mace can and riot baton from the dazed pembry's belt, spraying him in his bloody face, then clubbing him to his knees... boyle, mouth open in a silent scream, finding his key again, unlocking the handcuff, but then, as he starts to rise, seeing... dr. lecter standing over him, with the riot baton raised high; he swings it viciously down, again and again and again... then normal sound and motion are restored as we go to }
<B>__{close angle on}
<A>__{the cassette player, and the portrait of clarice, both now flecked with blood. in addition to the bach, we now hear soft panting, close by, and whimpering sobs in the background.}
<B>__{angle on dr. lecter}
<A>__{eyes closed, lost in a favorite passage of the music. his bloody fingers drift airily with the notes, as his breathing slows to normal. he opens his eyes, sighs contentedly, looks down.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{by the sprawled legs of boyle lie various objects that spilled from his pants pocket coins, a comb, a big pocketknife.}
<B>__{dr. lecter}
<A>__{picks up the pocketknife, examines it happily. about a four inch blade. he becomes aware of the whimpering, off screen, turns.}
<B>__{low angle on pembry}
<A>__{as he crawls, with torturous slowness, towards the command desk, and the phone. he is crying, but frantically determined. pembry's pov partially blurred, then clearing above the desk, hanging from pegs, are his and boyle's holstered revolvers...}
