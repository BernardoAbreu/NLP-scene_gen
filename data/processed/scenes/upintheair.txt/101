<L>__{exterior boat night}
<A>__{a nice two story yacht that was obviously purchased before the bubble popped. inside the galley, a group is playing karaoke. natalie, wearing badges like mardi gras beads, is singing "time after time". meanwhile, near the back, ryan and alex sit with their legs hanging off the back of the hull.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{back home, i don't get to act the way i do with you.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{that's why i don't have a "back home".}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i know. you're so cool. "mr. empty back pack".}
<A>__{ryan emotionally stumbles.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{you know about the back pack?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i googled you.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{you did?}
<C>__{alex}
<A>__{it's what us modern girls do when we have a crush.}
<C>__{ryan}
<A>__{did it bother you?}
<C>__{alex}
<A>__{well, that depends. is the bag empty because you hate people or just the baggage they bring along?}
<C>__{ryan}
<A>__{i don't hate people. i'm not exactly a hermit.}
<C>__{alex}
<A>__{you just don't want to be tied down? the whole responsibility thing.}
<C>__{ryan}
<A>__{i don't think it's even that... i... first time i ever flew, i was sixteen.}
<C>__{alex}
<A>__{you're not going to answer? you're just going to tell me a story?}
<C>__{ryan}
<P>__{(smiles, continues story)}
<A>__{it was january and i had just gotten my driver's license. the lakes were frozen over, so we piled into my car and hit the ice to do donuts. when, out of nowhere, i hit a soft spot and the hood of my car tilted up and i was sinking backwards into the water.}
<C>__{alex}
<A>__{jesus...}
<C>__{ryan}
<A>__{i literally started to drown. within a few seconds, i black out. then, i wake up in the sky. i'm in a helicopter, laying on a stretcher. this guy in a uniform is telling me i was minutes away from dying.}
<C>__{alex}
<A>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{right?}
<P>__{(relives it for a second)}
<D>__{so just as we're hovering over the hospital, i sit up. and from there, i could see the whole western horizon. we'd been flying twenty minutes. twenty minutes to reach a city i'd thought of as remote, halfway across the state... a foreign capital.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{my parents had taught me we lived in the best place on earth, but now i could see the world was really just one place and comparing didn't make much sense. and i remember thinking don't tell me this isn't an age of miracles. don't tell me we can't be everywhere at once.}
<A>__{the idea settles in. ryan returns to the pointerior}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i don't know what originally sparked the back pack. i probably needed to be alone. recently, i've been thinking that maybe i needed to empty the bag before i knew what to put back in.}
<A>__{and now they kiss. it's notably different from their previous kisses. now, when they lock lips, we are reminded why people kiss in the first place. then, all of a sudden, the lights go out on the boat. the motor has stopped. ryan and alex look back to find the software dude stepping out of the galley, drunk.}
<C>__{software dude}
<D>__{hey... i think we're out of gas.}
<A>__{ryan and alex look out to shore... about 500 yards away. for whatever reason, they just start cracking up.}
