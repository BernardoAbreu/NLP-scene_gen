<L>__{exterior maddy's caravan. afternoon}
<A>__{harsh whistles. a secret place, in the heart of a forest. there's the answering sound of small bells, a chorus of them. inman is dragged into view on a makeshift litter. goats appear, they herd around the figure dragging the litter. it's an old woman, silver haired, her face a leather map, her clothes leather, everything about her like old leather.}
<B>__{her name is maddy.}
<A>__{she and inman round a bend and there's maddy's house an old caravan, long grown into the ground and plaited with vines and creepers. inman tries to sit up. an old whiskered billygoat butts up against inman, knocks him down. maddy pays no attention to the struggle, heads inside her caravan.}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{mind that billy, he's the jealous kind.}
<A>__{she emerges, with a bowl of water, rags, washes his face, pushing back his hair to look at his wound, puts a finger to the gash on his neck professional in her appraisal. inman is barely conscious, he groans, trying to defend himself.}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{pay no attention to me. what happened to your head?}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{fighting.}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{and your neck?}

<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{you're the color of a cadaver. i will fix you. i can fix you up.}
<C>__{inman}
<P>__{(speaking of his spirit)}
<D>__{mister you could fix me i'd be in your everlasting debt.}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{debts, fighting them words don't mean much round here. for the record, i'm a female of the species.}
