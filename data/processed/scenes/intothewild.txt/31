<L>__{interior college building}
<A>__{shaky hand held home video image (4 years earlier): chris mccandless speaking to camera holds a microphone in a shadowy room, doing his geraldo rivera. it's tongue in cheek at best.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{this is emory university freshman chris mccandless reporting from the vault at thompson hall.}
<A>__{he indicates a hatchway in the floor leading to a brightly lit corridor below.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{we have just dynamited the hatchway and are the first human beings to step foot into this vault in over a hundred years. somewhere in here lies the secret of the great beast within us all. a beast built on lies, corruption, and greed.}
<A>__{we hear a growling sound from behind chris.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{and there it is! the legendary beast mocra.}
<A>__{camera quickly pans to a blanket wrapped, crawling fellow student in a grotesque halloween mask. we move into cu on the monster growling. quick pan back to chris.}
<C>__{chris }
<P>__{(in mock fright)}
<D>__{we've got to get out of here quick and re secure the hatch while we make a plan of how to kill the beast.}
<A>__{camera shakes all over like a bad horror film trying to stay with chris as he makes a quick escape down the hatchway into the university dorm corridor. clumsy video time cut: chris nailing the last nail in the hatchway from below. he climbs down the steps where he exchanges his hammer for his microphone from an off camera source.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{well, it looks like we've succeeded }
<A>__{we hear the monster's growl from above.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{ at least for the moment, in sealing the beast back into the vault. your humble reporter, chris mccandless will now struggle with the journalistic question of ethics: will he retain his reporter's objectiveness or save the future of human truth by slaying this awful beast?}
<A>__{he gives us a look of vaudevillian puzzlement what will he do?}
