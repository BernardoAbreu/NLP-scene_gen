<A>__{gordy holds matt in his arms as water pours over them. it's the second child he's held in the last few hours. this one is his, this one is safe at home and unafraid: what a father wants for his child. we see the deep affection gordy has for his son. he holds matt tightly, skin to skin, and kisses the boy's wet head... anne opens the shower door. she's on the phone.}

<D>__{dr. bob can squeeze him in at twelve. i have a patient relations meeting at twelve fifteen. can you take him?}

<P>__{(hangs up; to gordy)}
<D>__{five of in front of dr. bob's. don't be late.}
<P>__{(to matt)}
<D>__{let's get you out, sweetie. your father just can't keep you dry.}
<A>__{she leads matt out. closes the shower door. gordy sticks his face into the water. looks back, finds... two bare butts, anne's and matt's, are pressed against the shower door's foggy glass. off gordy, laughing }
