<L>__{400s plastic skinned terminators armed with plasma}
<A>__{rifles. they wear a motley collection of found clothing, but their male humanoid faces are identical, unnatural and motionless, like masks. their eyes flicker red as they scan him.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{oh god...}
<A>__{marcus backs away, runs. the t 400s stare after him but don't fire. angle through binocular mask marcus running for all he's worth, heading toward the viewer. we hear a muttering voice:}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{hey mister, where you goin' in such a hurry?}
<A>__{angle on a boy, scrawny and filthy, in his early to mid teens. he crouches on the supports of a freeway sign. he wears layers of tattered, over sized clothing. he scrambles quickly down from the sign. at an off ramp, marcus' pace slows as he moves to get off the freeway, when the boy emerges from behind some rubble, holding a handgun in one hand, a lit oil lantern in the other.}
<C>__{boy }
<D>__{whoah, whoah hang on there. got any food?}
<A>__{marcus raises his hands, shakes his head. the boy looks him over dubiously.}
<C>__{boy }
<D>__{you look like you been eating pretty good.}
<A>__{the boy moves closer, puts down the lantern, frisks marcus with one hand while holding the gun on him with the other.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you're human... you can see me, you can touch me. this place is real.}
<A>__{the boy makes a dubious face, yanks a handful of paper scraps from marcus' pocket.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{i thought i was in hell.}
<C>__{boy}
<P>__{(raises an eyebrow)}
<D>__{this sure ain't heaven.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{those things with masks, red eyes }
<C>__{boy}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{terminators t 400s. what is this stuff?}
<A>__{the boy unfolds the paper scraps in the lantern light angle on paper scraps the woman's face from the poster, a fragment of a model's photo from a magazine ad, a painting of a female face from a paperback cover. the boy looks puzzled, intrigued by the pictures. but with sudden speed, marcus grabs the boy's gun hand and wrenches it hard it fires into the air. marcus gets control of the gun, wraps one arm around the boy's throat.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{if i'm not in hell, where am i?!}
<C>__{boy}
<P>__{(choking)}
<D>__{texas!}
<A>__{the noise of a shotgun pumping close behind marcus marcus spins to face his attacker, pressing the handgun into the boy's cheek. he's face to face with a girl, a couple of years younger than the boy, training the shotgun at marcus' head she looks ready to shoot.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{let him go!}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{first put down the shotgun.}
<A>__{the girl shakes her head angrily. she wears an aged, beloved baseball cap with a star on it.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{do what he says.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{he'll kill us both!}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i don't wanna kill anyone.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{do it, star. put it down.}
<A>__{she shakes her head slightly, aiming carefully at marcus' head, just a few feet away, a slight smile on her face.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{there was only one bullet in that gun.}
<A>__{marcus hooks his foot around the oil lantern and deftly boots it at the girl. burning oil spills across her leg, she cries out and fumbles the shotgun. marcus tosses the boy at her, the two of them sprawl on the ground, the shotgun falling to one side marcus quickly snatches up the shotgun. using snow, the boy helps the girl extinguish the flames from her clothing. marcus stands over the kids with a gun in each hand. he struggles to control anger, speaks quietly.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i don't like it when people point guns at me.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{it wasn't loaded.}
<A>__{marcus quickly checks the chambers of both the shotgun and handgun indeed, both are empty.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you took on a guy like me with one bullet and an empty shotgun?}
<P>__{(studies them admiringly)}
<D>__{pretty stupid.}
<A>__{he shoves the handgun in his belt, puts the shotgun down and kneels to pick up fallen scraps of paper a few have caught fire and are incinerated. the boy and girl get to their feet, stare at marcus.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{can i have my gun back?}
<A>__{marcus shrugs, gestures for her to pick it up. he still looks at the pictures in his hands.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{where'd you get those?}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{in the city.}
<C>__{boy}
<P>__{(steps away from him)}
<D>__{the city? oh man. that place is red hot.}
<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(a small smile)}
<D>__{seemed kinda dead to me.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{no radiation.}
<A>__{a spotlight appears in the distance a roving hunter killer moving in their direction. quickly, automatically, the kids dive for cover behind a wall of debris. marcus looks toward the light, unaware of danger. the boy bolts from behind cover, grabs marcus by the arm }
<C>__{boy }
<D>__{get down, they've seen the light!}
<A>__{he drags marcus back behind the debris wall, just in time as the h k nears, the light finds the burning oil. it fires blue pulses, which chew up the asphalt nearby then it moves on, failing to pick out the humans. marcus is dumbfounded.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{that wasn't a helicopter...}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{it's an h k hunter killer. where the hell have you been?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{rads musta fried his brains. let's go, kyle.}
<A>__{the h k has vanished in the distance. the girl rises. the boy kyle shakes his head, stays at marcus' side.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{marcus. marcus wright.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{kyle reese.}
<P>__{(indicates girl)}
<D>__{she doesn't remember her name }
<P>__{(re: her cap)}
<D>__{ so i call her star.}
<A>__{star gives marcus a small, reluctant wave.}
<C>__{kyle }
<D>__{gonna be light soon, marcus, better find cover. we spotted some buildings half a mile that way.}
<A>__{kyle points but gets no response. he shrugs, sets off with star in that direction. kyle calls over his shoulder:}
<C>__{kyle }
<D>__{you can come if you want.}
<C>__{star}
<P>__{(hissing at him)}
<D>__{why? we don't need him.}
<C>__{kyle}
<P>__{(a shrug, sotto)}
<D>__{i like him. he's funny.}
<A>__{marcus looks around at the desolate world and the two teens receding ahead of him. after a beat, he follows.}
