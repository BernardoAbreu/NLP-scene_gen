<L>__{exterior crossroads night later}
<A>__{by the blazing fire willow feeds the baby. we hear hoofbeats.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{hey! somebody's coming!}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{peck! quick! douse the fire!}
<A>__{excited, willow tosses more wood on the fire, picks up the baby and waits.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{no, you fool! put it out i say! out!}
<A>__{torches appear up the road. a horse drawn wagon clatters full speed toward the fire. we hear load drunken voices, far from friendly. willow quickly dives into the bushes. four boorish picts, with tatooed faces and arms, halt at the crossroads, yelling and waving their torches. madmartigan is hidden under his rags. for fun the picts set fire to the skeleton cage. then head for the other.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{no!!}
<A>__{he rises up in the torchlight. the picts taunt him.}
<C>__{pict}
<D>__{whose fire!}
<A>__{they jab their torches at madmartigan.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{no! help! stop!}
<C>__{pict}
<D>__{where are they? where did they go?}
<A>__{madmartigan points way up the road. the picts ride away. as they go, they swing his cage and st fire to the floor of it. madmartigan frantically geats the flames. his sleeves ignite. willow scrambles out of the bushes and scoops up hand fuls of dirt, which he chucks at madmartigan.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<P>__{(spitting out dirt)}
<D>__{thanks for your help, peck.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{as if you care. i saved your life, peck. those guys woulda killed us!}
<P>__{(points dramatically)}
<D>__{you wanna give your baby to them?? they eat babies!}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{madmartigan literally licks his wounds, dragging his parched tongue along the length of his forearm. willow begins to walk away.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{the world's gone insane. good men locked in cages, criminals running free. it doesn't pay to be honest, peck.}
<A>__{willow stops and turns around.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{don't call me a peck. my name is willow.}
<A>__{madmartigan slinks down like a cat and slowly extends his derty hand through the bars.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{hello, willow. i'm madmartigan.}
<A>__{willow stares warily at the hand. madmartigan smiles. willow quickly shakes his hand and jumps away. madmar tigan laughs in a harmless, friendly way.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{you a woodcutter?}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{farmer.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{farmer! i knew it! you're a vic tim, willow. yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor rupt, rotten world.}
<A>__{a rat lumbers out of the darkness and sniffs toward the baby in the porta crib. madmartigan suddenly points. willow screams and chases the rat away. madmartigan shakes his head as solemnly as an undertaker.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{listen, willow my friend. i'm really a good man. give me my freedom, and i will look after that baby for you. trust me.}
<A>__{after a moment, willow takes out his dagger. he stands on his toes under a cage, reaches up, and hacks at the chain lock. madmartigan's eyes widen over eagerly. he rubs his hands together and licks his lips.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{that's it good good like that, yes, good, good, the chain that's it, come on come on !}
<A>__{willow suddenly steps away.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{nooo, i don't think i should.}
<A>__{madmartigan goes berserk. his arms flail and the whole cage shakes and swings and he bangs his head on the roof.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{peck!! stupid peck! i will kill ya! let me out!}
<A>__{willow scrambles back to the fire and scoops up the baby and rocks her in his arms.}
