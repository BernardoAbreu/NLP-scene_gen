<B>__{harris}
<A>__{watching the game from the dugout, a zip lock baggie full of ice cubes strapped to his head.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{we're in the ninth, two down, man on first and the indians clinging to a one run lead. vaughan, one out away from his first major league victory...}
<B>__{omit}
<B>__{vaughan}
<A>__{vaughn, wearing his new glasses, paces the mound nervously. he goes to the rosin bag, wipes his brow, shakes out his arm. finally up on the rubber, he gets the sign from taylor, goes to his stretch, checks the runner and fires to the plate.}
<B>__{the oakland batter}
<A>__{swings and hits a grounder between third and short. dorn moves to his left, but the ball goes past his glove and into left field. there is some question as to whether dorn really gave it a full effort.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{bouncing ball, dorn can't get to it, into left field, base hit. clarke digging around second, he'll make it to third, and the a's have runners at the corners.}
<A>__{vaughn stomps around on the mound, obviously upset. he glares at dorn a beat before getting back on the mound. dorn's face is non commital. brown paces in the dugout.}
<C>__{pepper}
<D>__{you want me to go get him?}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{no, he's come this far. let's see if he can finish it.}
<A>__{doyle downs a little more rum and coke in the press box.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{vaughn in a little trouble here, but i will tell ya, these cleveland fans are great. listen to them get behind vaughn.}
<A>__{doyle imitates the sound of a crowd cheering with his own voice, punctuated by whistles and clapping.}
<B>__{the bleacher band}
<A>__{thelma calmly knits her blanket with the scores of all the indians' games stitched into it, the madame la farge of cleveland. the boys, however, are a little restless.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{we need some defense here. maybe we oughta do a wave.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{c'mon, indians don't do waves. let's keep this thing pure.}
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{what harm could it do?}
<B>__{rexman}
<A>__{the next oakland hitter, steps in. taylor flashes a sign. vaughn comes to the stretch and delivers. high, ball one. the runner on first goes down to second without a throw, the pitch being too tough to handle.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{runner goes, high, taylor has no play. the go ahead and potential winning run is in scoring position.}
<A>__{taylor walks out in front of the plate to throw the ball back to vaughn.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{forget the runners, ricky, get this guy at the plate.}
<A>__{taylor goes back behind the dish. vaughn gets up on the rubber. he winds and comes to the plate. way high this time.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{high ball two, and the crowd doesn't like that call one bit.}
<A>__{doyle imitates the sound of a crowd booing. taylor, meanwhile, has gone out to the mound.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{okay, let's get nasty here, rick. you know he's lookin' for this pitch. gotta come up with somethin' studly.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{fuckin' dorn. game shoulda been over by now. dorn coulda had that ball. he tanked it on purpose.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{this isn't the california penal league, vaughn. we're professionals here. we don't tank a play for personal reasons, so cut the crybaby shit. you've pitched a helluva game. you wanna finish it, don't ya?}
<A>__{vaughn nods.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{can you give me a strike on this pitch?}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{yeh, but i don't know if there'll be much on it. my arm feels like jello.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{just make sure it's over the plate. i want him to swing.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{the last time i did that, the guy hit one that hasn't landed yet.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{don't worry, i will take care of it.}
<A>__{taylor starts back toward the plate, and then stops.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{by the way, i been meaning to ask you. why'd you steal that car?}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{i was bored.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{next time you might think about takin' in a movie or somethin'.}
<A>__{vaughn permits himself a little smile and release from the tension. taylor smiles back, and trots off toward the plate.}
<B>__{the bleacher band}
<A>__{bobby and vic are doing a two man wave. when one sits down, the other stands up.}
<B>__{taylor}
<A>__{has settled in behind the plate now. he starts talking to the batter, rexman.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{helluva situation we got goin' here, huh, rexman? two on, two out, you're down by a run in the ninth. you got a chance to be a hero on national television, so whatever you do, don't blow it. they'll be callin' you a gutless choke artist all over america.}
<A>__{rexman shoots taylor a wicked glance.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{you're a free agent at the end of the year. not much demand for gutless choke artists. what are you hittin' now? .230? .240?}
<C>__{rexman}
<D>__{.316.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{hey, nice average. uh oh, on second thought, that still means you got a seven outta ten chance of goin' in the dumper.}
<A>__{rexman, slightly irritated, backs out of the box.}
<C>__{rexman}
<D>__{shut up, will ya, taylor?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{hey, i can understand not wantin' to talk about baseball when your nuts are in a vice like this.}
<A>__{rexman gets back in the box.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{by the way, i saw your wife at the capri lounge last night. hell of a dancer. you must be very proud.}
<A>__{rexman is trying to ignore taylor, but failing badly. taylor flashes a sign to vaughn. vaughn goes into his windup.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{but that guy she was with... i mean i'm sure he's a close personal friend of yours and all, but tell me...}
<A>__{vaughn releases his pitch.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{...why was he wearing her panties on his head?}
<A>__{rexman, completely unnerved, takes a feeble swing and hits a high pop up out in front of the plate.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{uh oh, rexie, i don't think that one's got the distance. maybe if the wind comes up.}
<A>__{taylor moves out two steps and makes the catch easily, ending the game. taylor rushes out to congratulate vaughn. the players exchange handshakes and high fives, as brown watches from the dugout.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{it's startin' to come together, pepper. it's startin' to come together.}
