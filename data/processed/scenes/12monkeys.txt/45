<A>__{cole comes awake with a start. the room is dark now, except... a slide is being projected on a torn screen. it's a picture of a stenciled graffiti...the logo of the army of the 12 monkeys.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{what about it, cole?}
<C>__{zoologist}
<D>__{did you see it?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{uh, no, sir. i...}
<A>__{another slide clicks into place. youthful protesters, their placards featuring slogans and images of animal atrocities, confront police in riot gear.}
<C>__{astrophysicist}
<D>__{what about these people? did you see any of these people?}
<A>__{zooming in, panning, the scientists emphasize the faces of the protesters. the faces are unfamiliar to cole (though we will recognize some of them later on).}
<C>__{cole }
<D>__{uh, no, sir, i...wait!}
<A>__{the image pans back to a much enlarged blurry face among the protesters. in spite of the poor image, the expression of rage is clear, and it seems to resemble a somewhat older jeffrey mason.}
<C>__{astrophysicist}
<D>__{him? you saw that man?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{uh, i think so. in the mental hospital.}
<C>__{micro3iologist}
<P>__{(switching on the light)}
<D>__{you were in a mental institution?!}
<A>__{the scientists mutter disapprovingly among themselves.}
<C>__{astrophysicist}
<D>__{you were sent to make very important observations!}
<C>__{botanist}
<D>__{you could have made a real contribution.}
<C>__{geologist}
<D>__{helped to reclaim the planet...}
<C>__{zoologist}
<D>__{as well as reducing your sentence.}
<C>__{microbiologist}
<D>__{the question is, cole "do you want another chance?"}
<A>__{cole stares at them, trying to figure out what they mean.}
