<A>__{camera adjusts from the sign indicating gate 39. the class is squirrely and excited. mr. murnau, ms. lewton, and the parent chaperones are allowing kids to burn off steam at the gate, hoping for a calm flight. camera moves along the awaiting passengers... carter and terry are making out, a step away from heavy petting... blake and christa are flipping through parisian fashion magizines... billy hitchcock lays into a burrito supreme... camera moves to an empty seat. clear rivers enters frame and sits, struggling with her walkman, coffee, books, and a cassette box handmarked "boingo" (a cheat that we hear the song) as she places her stuff on the unoccupied seat beside her, a paris guidebook falls on the floor, opened but face down. a passing, unidentified, student reaches down and hands her the book, still open and face down.}

<D>__{dude, get wisdom. we're about to board a seven hour flight. the toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. what if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torgue a wicked cable and then right after you walks in christa or blake? you want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?}
