<A>__{where michaud himself, wearing a kevlar vest now, is wielding the torch. expertly cutting the metal while scully and two agents and two dallas bomb squad men look on. in the b.g. building employees are streaming out. michaud finishes and shuts off the torch. yelling:}

<D>__{go.}
<A>__{the other agents kick the metal door in sending it crashing to the floor. mulder stands on the other side. watching michaud pick up a heft tool kit, stepping over the downed door. scully right behind him. along with the agents, bomb techs. angle over mulder and the soda machine bomb as michaud steps in next to him, sizing up the time on the ticking digital readout: 4:07. and just exactly what kind of defusing work he's got cut out for him.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{tell me this is just soda pop in those canisters.}
<C>__{s.a.c. michaud}
<D>__{no. it's what it looks like. a big i.e.d. ten gallons of astrolite.}
<P>__{(studying the bomb)}
<D>__{okay, get everybody out of here and clear the building.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{somebody's got to stay with you }
<C>__{s.a.c. michaud}
<D>__{i gave you an order. now get the hell out of here and evacuate the area.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{can you defuse it?}
<A>__{setting his tool kit down, opening it. as the other agents heed his word, exiting the room.}
<C>__{s.a.c. michaud}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{you've got about four minutes to find out if you're wrong.}
<A>__{michaud turns on him with unexpected intensity.}
<C>__{s.a.c. michaud}
<D>__{did you hear what i said?}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{let's go, mulder.}
<A>__{scully starts out. mulder stares at michaud for a moment, but michaud's focus is on the bomb now. he won't meet mulder's look. finally mulder moves off, following scully. camera holds on michaud, just staring at the bomb. just staring.}
