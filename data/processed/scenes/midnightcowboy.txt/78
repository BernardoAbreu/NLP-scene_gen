<L>__{interior cass's apartment day}
<A>__{a princess telephone is ringing on a gold and white desk. cass runs to grab it...}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{... as joe steps from the elevator, which opens directly onto cass's penthouse. cass beckons him toward her, hooks a finger into his neckerchief and pulls his mouth toward hers while she talks on the phone.}
<C>__{cass }
<D>__{morey? hi ee, honey...}
<A>__{cass gurgles happily as her free hand unbuckles joe's garrison belt.}
<C>__{cass }
<D>__{i'm just out of breath, honey, running to catch the phone.}
<A>__{as her fingers reach for joe's zipper, cut to... ... joe's hand unzipping her dress.}
<C>__{cass }
<D>__{i was walking baby. him got to do him goody goods, right?}
<A>__{the poodle tugs at joe's slacks until they fall. cass steers her ear to joe's mouth, shuddering deliciously.}
<C>__{cass }
<D>__{oh god, oh stop. i can't stand that. i just die...}
<P>__{(quickly into phone)}
<D>__{it's baby, morey. him trying to say hello. say hello to morey, baby.}
<A>__{cass holds the phone toward the yapping poodle, twisting herself against joe as she wriggles out of her dress, passing the phone from one hand to the other.}
<C>__{cass }
<D>__{okay, old goosie? now lookie, when do you want me to meet you? whatever you say. i will take a nap, watch tv, you know, kill time. okay, but just one, a big wet one.}
<A>__{cass hangs up. the poodle yaps hysterically, disentangling himself from her tumbling dress hops onto the couch glances off and flees again as an overturned lamp crashes}
<B>__{o.s.}
