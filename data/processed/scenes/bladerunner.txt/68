<L>__{interior old opera house bar night}
<A>__{cheap whiskey and bad wine. that's the kind of place this is. it's near closing. but still a few at the bar. alcoholic silhouettes. in the b.g. deckard comes down the passage from the men's room and stops at the phone. he gets a number out of his pocket and calls it. as he talks he leans against the wall, his body language intimate and chummy. not much action at the bar other than somebody snoring and a dipso down at the end having a conversation with himself. deckard hangs up, walks to the bar and straggles a stool. the bartender's a big lady with tits like sand bags and a voice that plays no favorites.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{i can't protect your drinks, mister; while you was in the potty, this hummer snatched it.}
<A>__{deckard glances at his stool mate. a huge man, slumped over the bar like a beached whale.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{no problem. gimme another.}
<A>__{the whale doesn't move, but it speaks, with a gravelly russian accent.}
<C>__{russian}
<D>__{forgive me. i thought was free drink. i will pay.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{forget it.}
<A>__{but the big man's digging through his pockets. deck ard's drink arrives and the russian raises his head. it's a big melancholy face with a glint of warmth in his red rimmed eyes and a smile that could melt your heart. but it's leon.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i think i have no money.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{it's okay. forget it.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{but i would like to buy you drink.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i will but you one. what'll you have?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{vodka!}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{shot of vodka, please.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{thank you very much.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{my pleasure.}
<A>__{deckard brings out his smokes. offers one. leon takes it and they light up. the drinks come.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{prosit.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{prosit.}
<A>__{down the hatch. leon slaps his glass on the bar, reach es into his pocket, brings out a little match box and slaps that down too. it's done with such pride that deckard has to look.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{you want to see my friends?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{sorry, don't have the time.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{no problem.}
<A>__{leon smiles broadly and with ceremonious care opens the box and dumps three live cockroaches on the bar.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{those cockroaches?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{ya.}
<A>__{deckard looks interested. one of them starts to scamp er away, but leon walls off the next with his huge hand.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{how long you had these guys?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{two months. but this one is not guy. it is girl. his girl.}
<A>__{leon leans closer like he doesn't want the cockroaches to hear.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{usually blackie waits until igor is eating; then, when his back is turned, he tries to take advantage of anna.}
<A>__{deckard nods, definitely interested. he signals the bartender for another round. the drinks arrive.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{prosit.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{prosit.}
<A>__{down the hatch. their eyes meet at the bottom.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{you never saw a cockroach make love?}
<A>__{deckard shakes his head, but he'd like to. leon smiles slyly.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{we will try.}
<A>__{leon brings a cube of sugar out of his pocket and puts it on the bar. they both lean down and watch intently. the drinks come and are put away, but the cockroaches are not cooperating.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{it must be that he is not hungry or maybe she is not hot.}
<A>__{leon is catching the roaches and one by one puts them back in their box. he holds up the last and kisses it.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{you like to kiss her goodbye.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{make sure you take your girlfriends with you when you leave.}
<A>__{what neither of them notices is that between leon's fingers, his stub of his cigarette is burning his flesh. deckard lifts his glass, it is empty.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i like you.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i like you too.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{one more, eh?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i gotta piss.}
<A>__{deckard gets on his feet, leans forward like a man in a stiff wind and stops.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i think i will piss outside.}
<A>__{leon watches his walk a perfect straight line through the bar down the passage and out of the rear exit.}
