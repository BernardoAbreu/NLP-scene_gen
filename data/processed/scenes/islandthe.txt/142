<L>__{interior. boathouse encanto park night}
<A>__{the refuge of shadow. the collapsed roof allowing streams and puddles of moonlight. lincoln helps ester onto a rotted bench. she slumps down, exhausted, lincoln watches her, helplessly. she's fighting for breath, wheezing and coughing in deep rasps.}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{i can't... i can't breathe... my throat... it's so... dry...}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i ' l l find you some water.}
<A>__{he looks around blindly. some junk in the corner. he rummages, finds a rusted metal box. pries it open, empties the contents. gauzes, band aids evidently a first aid box then a bottle. he opens it, sniffs. it smells pungent. alcohol, not water. ester suddenly starts sobbing. lincoln returns to her side }
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i t ' s going to be okay, ester.}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{n o . . . no, it isn't...}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i ' l l find you some water, okay?}
<A>__{ester looks up at him, wheezing, tears streaming from her eyes }
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{an d then what, lincoln?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i ' l l find another way. out of state.}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{an d then what? what if they find us?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{the n we'll keep going.}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{i can't... i can't run anymore...}
<A>__{ester folds over, sobbing and coughing at the same time. pitiful to watch. lincoln crouches, gaining her eyeline, very deliberate }
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{we ' l l keep going till we get there.}
<A>__{ester traps a sob, reading his eyes, something reviving in her }
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{the island... you mean, the island?}
<A>__{lincoln answers with a brief smile. if this will keep her going then the truth is redundant. he eases her out of the moment }
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{now i'm going to get some water. but i want you to stay here. it'll be safer.}
<A>__{ester wipes away her tears, sniffing. her breaths, calming.}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{don't go yet. stay with me, lincoln. stay with me for a little while.}
<A>__{lincoln looks puzzled by ester's request. even more puzzled as she rests her head on his shoulder, nestling into his neck. he feels her against him. the warmth spreading through him again. his arm reaching, as if of its own accord, closing around her. i t feels right somehow. and there he stays, holding her, looking out across the dereliction. and the moon rises over encanto p a r k .}
