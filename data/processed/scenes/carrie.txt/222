<A>__{as josie and the moonglows launch into a new number. george suddenly comes to life.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{viiibes!}
<A>__{he grabs frieda, and they make their way out onto the dance floor, frieda shrugging helplessly at carrie.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{they're nice. george is funny.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{he's a good guy.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{see, didn't i tell you?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sure you don't want to dance?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{could we just sit here for a minute?}
<A>__{tommy nods it's okay with him.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{carrie?}
<A>__{carrie turns around and finds herself facing collins dressed up, looking more like one of the students than a teacher.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{you look very pretty, miss collins.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{thank you}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you too. beautiful.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{it's awfully nice of you to say so. i know i'm not... not really... but thank you anyway.}
<A>__{tommy feeling like a fifth wheel clears his throat and stands up.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{`scuse me.}
<P>__{(to carrie)}
<D>__{be right back, okay?}
<A>__{he goes off into the crowd.}
<C>__{collins}
<P>__{(gesturing to his seat)}
<D>__{may i?}
<A>__{carrie nods, and she sits down, pulling the chair next to her. they're virtually alone at this moment; everyone else is dancing or occupied.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{carrie, anything that happened before... well, it's all forgotten. i want you to know that.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i can't forget it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but it's over with. it's over.}
<A>__{collins smiles; she looks at the dance floor and carrie's eyes follow hers. at this particular moment, the band is playing a quiet number slow, romantic.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{i remember my own prom. i was two inches taller than the boy i went with when i was in my heels. he gave me a corsage that clashed with my gown. but it was magic. i don't know why. but i've never had a date like it, ever since. is it like that for you?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{it's very... nice.}
<C>__{collins}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{just nice?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{no. there's more. i don't know...}
<P>__{(hesitating; then)}
<D>__{...it's like being on mars.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{you'll never forget it.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i think you're right.}
<A>__{and then, on sheer impulse, carrie reaches out and hugs her, hugs her tightly.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{have a lovely time, carrie.}
<C>__{tommy }
<D>__{hey, what's going on here?}
<A>__{there is tommy, looking "stern."}
<C>__{tommy}
<P>__{(to collins)}
<D>__{what are you doing with my date?}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{girl secrets.}
<A>__{a smile at carrie, and she goes off.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{don't let me catch you hugging any guys.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{you won't.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{better not. hey, listen, do you really have to be back so early?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i promised.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{okay. i understand.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{no, it's okay. listen, the other kids are going over to lewiston after the prom}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(breaking in)}
<D>__{that's okay.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{what is?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{you want to go with your friends. i don't want to spoil anything...}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{hey, let me finish. what i was going to say, i mean if it'd be alright with you, what do you say we go to the cavalier?}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(surprised; she'd love to)}
<D>__{i've never been there.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{hey, great. we'll have the place all to ourselves. great!}
<P>__{(he means it)}
<D>__{then it's settled.}
<A>__{he takes her arm, turns her toward the dance floor.}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(holding back)}
<D>__{tommy...}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{c'mon...}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i don't... i can't... i...}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{you can.}
<A>__{he has his arms around her and half spins, half tugs her out onto the floor. he is a young man of considerable confidence the best part of his popularity and it's a contagious trait. gradually, carrie gets caught up in the slow dancing, begins to follow him less and less awkwardly, begins to get less and less self conscious, and, in short, starts to glide into her freedom.}
