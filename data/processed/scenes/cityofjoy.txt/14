<A>__{feet maidan feet tramping the pulsating tarmac, sending up dust.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{the pals, scared, dispirited, weary, consumed by the crowd. they've been walking a long time. shambu cries; aloka tries to ease his fear. they stop numbly at the edge of the park, put their bundles down against a long wall. across the way, a thin policeman shares a cigarette with a group of traders. there is a deeply fearful look in hasari's eyes, a look he is having difficulty controlling now. he needs to revive the family's confidence. he takes out his precious bundle of rupees and gives one to manooj. manooj, though, is fixed on the cinema across the street. hasari indicates a stall just across the main road.}

<D>__{manooj, go and get some fruit. come straight back.}
<A>__{delighted with his task, manooj sets off, his eyes on the marquee of the theater with its huge cardboard cutout of kumar kapur, starring in hot gun. hasari calls out to him to watch where he's going; the mere crossing of the street is a potential parental nightmare. a hand ruffles manooj's head and a tall man with dark eyes and a sweet smile comes at the boy's anxious parents.}

<D>__{yes, hello, brother. bihar, am i correct?}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{yes, how did you know?}
<A>__{hasari is torn between speaking to the man and watching his son's incredible journey across the street.}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{let me say only that the terrible malevolence that has visited your part of the country affects us all.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{three years without rain. nothing came out of the earth but debts.}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{terrible. and now, the family on the street. it is not acceptable.}

<D>__{and if i can't help, my name is not mr. gangooly... which, blessedly, it is.}
<A>__{and now a smile as full as the sky above.}
