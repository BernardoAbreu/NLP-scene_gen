<L>__{interior alike's kitchen late afternoon}
<A>__{arthur, audrey and sharonda are pegged around the dinner table. audrey's make up fails to cover the dark circles beneath her eyes and arthur has a week's worth of stubble. there is a jagged hole where alike usually sits. noticing the asymmetry, audrey bundles up alike's place setting and sweeps it onto the floor. sharonda looks from audrey to arthur then into her plate.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{you want to say grace?}
<A>__{arthur clears his throat.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{heavenly father...}
<A>__{audrey thrusts her hands out to arthur and sharonda. they each take her hand and arthur begins again.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{dear heavenly father we pray... we pray thank you for this food and we pray... we pray for your continued blessing...}
<A>__{arthur stops talking but his head remains bowed. an awkward silence ensues. audrey and sharonda look up at him still holding hands.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{amen!}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{amen.}
<A>__{audrey switches to an overly cheery auto pilot mode, babbling to no one in particular.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{i got this recipe from a magazine. supposed to be very good. and you see i made those green beans you like. sharonda pass the rice please.}
<A>__{sharonda, staring at her father doesn't reach for the bowl.}
<C>__{sharonda}
<D>__{dad. you know where she is.}
