<A>__{jack is driving. he checks the rear view mirror. all clear. jack accelerates the car, driving it hard at the sidewalk. the vehicle slams into the curb, mounting the pavement with a thump of crunching metal.}
<L>__{exterior countryside day}
<A>__{just east of the old city walls a dirt track meanders downhill through a series of small holdings, allotments and scrap metal yards. the car moves slowly. we can hear the scrape of trailing metal. jack pulls up beside a high chain fence. the dogs on the other side start barking. this sets off other dogs in other scrap yards. jack gets out of the car and approaches a makeshift hut beside the fence. before he's a metre from the door it opens and a tough, well built, unshaven italian man in his mid twenties looks him up and down.}
