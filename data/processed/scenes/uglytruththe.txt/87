<L>__{interior town car day}
<A>__{abby and mike sit in the backseat. abby looks down at her notes.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{okay, so let's go over the pre interview questions.}
<A>__{mike studies her.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i'm sorry you didn't get to meet little colin this weekend. and by little, i don't mean undersized, although i highly suspect that's the case.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{really? colin's penis? that's what you want to talk about right now? i was thinking maybe we should talk about what you're gonna say on the show.}
<P>__{(doing jay)}
<D>__{so, tell me mike. how did "the ugly truth" start?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{well, jay, i had a sales job where i drove around a lot, listening to talk radio. i started calling in and lo and behold, people liked what i had to say. then i decided what the hell, i need my own show. i have a message people need to hear.}
<A>__{abby rolls her eyes, still angry with him.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{yes thousands of lives are being enriched by your wisdom.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{excuse me, lady, but you have a boyfriend right now because of me.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{it may have started because of you, but it's lasted because of me.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{so, you've been acting like your normal control freak psycho self in front of him?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i'm not a control freak.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{when you checked into the hotel, did you or did you not insist on getting an "eastern facing" room on "a floor not below seven"?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i like rising with the sun. and a view.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{my point is, colin likes the mike version of abby, not the abby version of abby. so, don't go knocking my words of wisdom when you're living proof that they work.}
<A>__{abby sits there, fuming that he's right.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i could be having sex right now }
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{yeah, thanks to me.}
