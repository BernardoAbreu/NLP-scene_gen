<L>__{exterior the pin's house day}
<A>__{the bird of prey mailbox looms ominously. brendan knocks on the front door. no answer. he presses lightly on the screen door, and it gives.}
<L>__{interior kitchen same}
<A>__{empty. brendan crosses the warped linoleum and gently opens the narrow basement door. he descends into inky gloom.}
<L>__{interior basement hallway same}
<A>__{deathly still and silent. barely breathing, brendan goes to the lit doorway at the end of the hall.}
<L>__{interior pin's den same}
<A>__{empty. brendan floats through the room like a ghost, to the pin's desk. slowly, then with greater confidence he rifles through it papers and trinkets, meaningless. he reaches beneath the desk, knocking it gently with his knuckles. quickly he removes the top drawer and reaches down into the desk frame. brendan draws out a stack of hundred dollar bills two inches thick. he pulls out another. another. another. thumbing the stacks pure hundreds. something creaks in the hallway. brendan freezes. silently he replaces the money and drawer, his eyes on the doorway. he creeps towards the door on the balls of his feet.}
