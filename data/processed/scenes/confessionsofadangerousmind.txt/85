<L>__{interior board room day}
<A>__{leonard goldberg, a bunch of network executives, and barris sit around a conference table and watch a tv. on it is the dating game. a black bachelor is responding to the trombone question. he simulates the receiving of a blow job, moaning and writhing in his seat as the studio audience howls. barris has his head in his hands. goldberg signals an assistant, who switches off the television. the executives look quite grim.}
<C>__{goldberg}
<D>__{chuck, quite frankly these episodes are unairable.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{look, len, the show's spontaneous, it's unscripted. that's it's charm. i can't control what people say.}
<C>__{executive}
<D>__{be that as it may, mr. barris, we can't have black men getting blow jobs on national television!}
<C>__{goldberg}
<D>__{the point isn't that he's black, hank.}
<C>__{executive}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well, i know that. that's not what i meant.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{look, len, nobody is indifferent to these shows. right? and that's good. show business must avoid indifference at all costs.}
<C>__{executive}
<D>__{even when taste is involved?}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{taste is just a word.}
<C>__{executive}
<D>__{you don't fuck with taste, my friend!}
<C>__{barris}
<P>__{(uncomprehending)}
<D>__{what does that even mean? i don't even under }
<C>__{goldberg}
<D>__{chuck, we cannot air this stuff. that's it. if you can't figure out how to retain your spontaneity without the contestants being lewd, we're going to have to pull the show.}
