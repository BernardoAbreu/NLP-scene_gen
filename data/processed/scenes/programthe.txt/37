<T>__{smash cut to:}
<A>__{camille tennis courts night smashing a two fisted forehand right at us, grunting with the exertion. joe scrambles to get it back, but camille's a world class player. she attacks with a vengeance, blasting every shot ala jimmy connors, as bud lite and bobby collins watch, amazed. we begin a series of cuts detailing camille's relentless dismantling of joe: camille drilling a backhand down the line, joe barely getting it back to the net. camille hitting a powerhouse service ace, joe lunging and whiffing the return. camille crushing another forehand. joe crushes it back, sends it over the fence and into the parking lot. camille serving again at match pointerior joe pops up a weak return. camille puts it away with a powerhouse overhead, the ball almost knocking joe down. he flings his racket against the fence. camille comes to the net to shake hands, but joe hangs back.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{thanks for the game, heisman. you took it really well.}
<A>__{and she walks away along to the net. joe goes after her, pissed.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what's this heisman crap?}
<A>__{camille's taken aback, not realizing she'd struck a nerve.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i didn't say anything about being a heisman candidate. i don't go around strokin' myself about it. so what's this shit you're givin' me?}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{i... i'm sorry... i just figured you were probably kissin' yourself in the mirror every morning.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you figured wrong.}
<A>__{now joe walks away and camille goes after him.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{so what do you want, an apology? i just gave you one.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i want a rematch.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{a rematch?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{some other sport. i took my beating. you owe me one. either that or we go out.}
<A>__{camille considers, tries to figure out what she'd dislike least, knowing it'd be cheap to choose neither.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{i will think about it.}
<A>__{camille walks off, disappearing through the gate. joe walks off in the other direction. bud lite and bobby follow.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{real good date, joe. remind me to take her out.}
