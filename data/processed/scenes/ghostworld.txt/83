<C>__{enid}
<D>__{well when can we do something?}

<C>__{enid}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{so that's it? you don't ever want to see me again?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{no, of course i do... it's just that right now i need to }
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what's her problem anyway? did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{no, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how i would know somebody like you...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what does she mean by that "somebody like me"?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{just someone so young...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{you must have done something to make her think you like me.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i... i don't think so.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{does that mean you don't like me?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{no, of course not.}
<C>__{enid}
<P>__{(looks him in the eye)}
<D>__{so, do you like me, seymour?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{in what way do you mean?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{in whatever way you think i mean.}
<C>__{seymour}
<P>__{(not sure what to say; long pause)}
<D>__{i don't know... i'm sorry, but dana's a very jealous person. i just don't want to screw that up right now... i'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i don't think you understand how i really feel about you, seymour.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{...what do you mean?}
