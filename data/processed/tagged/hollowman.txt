<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{on complete darkness. a small door swings open. a circle of light reveals that we i re looking down the length of a tube. at the far end of the tube, we see a gloved hand dangling a rat. the hand shoves the frightened rat into the tube and closes the door behind it. the rat s stark white fur bristles and it begins to pad down the tube s length. after several feet, the tube opens up into a dimly lit cubicle. the rat hesitates and stops. the sounds of gentle breathing whispers in the rat s ears. the rat turns round to head back down the tube, but a door swings shut, trapping it in the cubicle. the rat cowers as the breathing turns to snorting. the rat s head jerks around, looking for signs of danger, but the cubicle is empty. the rat sees a water dish on the far side of the cubicle a place to hide and dashes toward it. but an invisible force descends. the rat squeals in agony as something smashes down on its body, crushing it. a loud bellow rings out, and the rat flies into the air, halting a few feet off the ground. its body writhes, struggling against the unholy force. then a sick crunch of tiny bones snapping. all life quickly drains from the levitating body. dead eyes... the creature s corpse floats in mid air. then the white fur of the rat explodes in a shower of blood. huge blood smeared incisors appear, as do the red slicked ape like lips. the gaping bloody mouth bites again into the rat.}

<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{in the background we hear jay leno s monologue from the tonight show. a small lamp and the glow from a computer screen illuminates sebastian caine, late twenties with the shabby good looks of a perpetual grad student. wiry framed and wearing only boxer shorts, sebastian sips coffee from an einstein coffee mug. he peers at a complex computer rendered molecule displayed on his screen. he pecks a few keys and the molecule shifts slightly, then falls apart. sebastian pulls a twinkie from a hostess box, unwraps the cellophane and sucks it down. he attacks the keyboard with renewed vigor. another molecule appears on the screen. sebastian s fingers fly across the keyboard. the molecule blinks on and off, it trembles and twists apart.}

<D>__{damnit.}
<A>__{sebastian pears out his window. across the courtyard, a light comes on in a neighboring window. he sees a brunette, mid twenties, absolutely stunning, enter her living room. the brunette thumbs through the mail, tosses it and then begins to undress. sebastian loans over to the window, getting interested. but when the brunette reaches her bra and panties, she crosses to the window and lowers her shades.}

<D>__{damnit.}
<A>__{sebastian leans back in his chair and closes his eyes. he s obviously tired. he opens his eyes and stares up at the ceiling. painted across the white matte finish in big red letters is a brief reminder you should be working. sebastian sighs, leans forward and begins pecking away again.}
<T>__{later:}
<A>__{the television is now only static. we pan by his alarm clock. 4 am. we find sebastian pacing in front of his computer. he gets an idea... slides back in his chair. types away again. the molecule reforms on the computer screen. he types a few more keys, waits, watches the molecule. nothing happens. he hits a few more keys and watches intently for a reaction.}

<L>__{interior another bedroom night}
<A>__{digital phone rings. in the bed, linda foster, late twenties, stirs from a deep sleep. as she straggles out of bed and over to her desk, we notice a young man sleeping next to her. the ringing continues. she moves her computer mouse around and her screen comes to life. she click on a telephone icon and the ringing stops. a beat later, sebastian appears in a window on her screen.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{sebastian, do you know what time it is?}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{you know da vinci never slept. said it was waste of time.}

<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{who s that?}
<A>__{linda pulls the camera off the top of the of the computer screen and positions it so sebastian can t see the bed.}

<L>__{exterior washington d.c. skyline day}
<A>__{from a distance, the nation s monuments stand awash in the harsh light of morning. camera finds a black porsche as it pulls to the security fence of a warehouse. the imposing structure is surrounded by a chainlink fence and barbed wire. the porsche is waved through security and heads straight into the warehouse.}
<L>__{interior warehouse day}
<A>__{the porsche pulls to a halt in a reserved parking space and sebastian exits, wearing a hawaiian shirt, shorts, and birkenstocks. he notes the other cars parked in the lot, then crosses to bunker in the center of the warehouse, guarded by a marine, shouldering an m 16.}
<C>__{marine guard}
<D>__{morning, sir.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{morning, ed.}
<C>__{marine guard}
<D>__{your team s in early. something special going on?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{sorry, ed. you know the rules.}
<A>__{sebastian presses his thumb against a glass screen. a laser reads his printerior scan readout: caine, sebastian clearance: alpha alpha three division: classified the doors whisk open and sebastian steps inside.}

<L>__{interior elevator day}

<C>__{elevator }
<D>__{authorization verified. good morning, dr. caine.}
<A>__{the elevator descends with a groaning hum. it passes below us and keeps descending into the belly of the earth, the shaft goes down forever.}
<L>__{interior habitat s corridor}
<A>__{we slowly push down a hallway panelled by plexiglas chambers. each chamber looks as if it s tailored for a specific animal, although no animals are visible. as we pass one habitat, something slams into the plexiglas and begins barking. another howl joins in. then screeching. suddenly the hallway fills with a dozen animal cries. thump.}
<B>__{thump.}
<A>__{the plexiglas on several chambers vibrates as if angry animals were slamming against it. but still, no animals are seen. above each chamber, video screens display thermal images revealing heat signatures of the various animals, but they remain invisible to the naked eye. matt taps on a sheet of plexiglas which seals off another seemingly empty cage.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{isabelle ...}
<A>__{the woodchips on the floor shift and suddenly the plexiglas steams up right in front of matt s face. the plexiglas begins to shake violently.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{calm down baby. calm down. it s okay...}
<A>__{matt takes a pair of thermal goggles from his belt and pulls them down over his eyes. thermal pov a rather large heat signature, ape like in shape, rattles about the cage. matt slowly unlatches the plexiglas door and reaches inside.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{it s okay, baby. it s okay. i m not going to hurt you. come here.}
<A>__{thermal pov he reaches out to the creature. he grabs hold of it, firmly. stroking it. the creature coos. matt reaches for a hypo and brings it up to the creature.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{just hold still.}
<A>__{something clamps down on his hand, breaking his skin. blood erupts in a bite pattern.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{ow, shit.}
<A>__{matt drops the hypo and falls back. the cage door flies open and something runs out. matt pulls himself up to see the heat signature running down the hallway. he turns around to see another heat signature coming at him. matt pulls off his goggles to see linda coming up the corridor.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{she bit me.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{yeah. she s become a lot more aggressive in the last few days.}
<A>__{linda takes the goggles from matt.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{go take care of that bite. i ll get her.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{and give you a chance to pull ahead? never.}
<A>__{linda opens a lock box at the end of the hallway and pulls out a two tranquilizer guns. she hands one to matt.}
<B>__{around the corner}
<A>__{a slight distortion shimmers as something runs past us. we hear hoots and footsteps. looking down the shadowy corridor, we hear grunting and a haunting heavy breathing. the control door is closed though and something large and angry is throwing itself against it. we can t see anything. a few moments later, linda and matt round the corner, wearing goggles and leveling their pistols.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(ala porky)}

<D>__{isabelle!}
<A>__{thermal pov dark hallway. movement. a red shimmering heat signature. it comes running at linda. howling. linda fires. a t dart flies. thwack... it stops in mid air. then falls. but it doesn t hit the floor. instead, it stops inches above the ground. thermal pov the heat signature lies in a heap at linda s feet.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{good shootin , tex.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{what s that make it?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i m still ahead. 6 to 5.}

<C>__{linda}
<D>__{but i m catching up.}
<L>__{interior corridor day}
<A>__{the elevator doors open and sebastian steps out. he s met by sarah kennedy, early thirties, a fiery red head.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{can i have a word?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{most normal people say good morning.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{don t you think you should test the protocol on the liver samples before you inject isabelle?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{how many tissue samples have we successfully regressed? hundreds, right? how many have gone on to work on the full system? none.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{that s beside the pointerior}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{no, that is the pointerior i m not going to waste six months of my life on an outmoded testing procedure. this thing works. i know it. i feel it.}
<A>__{linda comes down the corridor, listening in on the tail end of the conversation.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{fine. you can mop up afterward.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{you think i m going to kill isabelle?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{kill? more like liquefy.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{sarah, thank you for your opinion, but i m the project leader. understand?}
<A>__{she says ...}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{... but somehow it feels like fuck you. she storms off. sebastian turns to linda.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{how did you ever convince me to hire her?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{you said you wanted the beat vet in the country.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{yeah, well she cares more about the animals than the research.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{maybe that s why she s so good.}

<D>__{who da man? you da man.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{as we pull out we see we are.}
<L>__{interior laboratory day}
<A>__{almost feels like a dungeon. think high tech frankenstein. walls lined with video displays, technical readouts, bizarre medical equipment. on a table in the middle of the room, a sheet drapes over a humanoid form, strapped down at it s invisible limbs. the straps move slightly... ghostly. wires lead from the body to lots of machinery.}

<L>__{interior observation booth}
<A>__{frank chase, early thirties, and tech expert janice walton, early twenties, man a small booth above the lab. they re dressed more like band roadies than scientists. the room is crammed with electronic and recording equipment. a handful of monitors display different images of the lab. thermal and regular video. another screen monitors vital signs.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we are live and in color. on your mark.}

<D>__{ready.}
<A>__{she wraps a bungee cord around nothing and pulls it tight. she then takes some dye and sprays it. a surface appears, floating beneath the restraints. it sheens in the light as linda searches for a vein. she slaps the surface several times. a small bulge appears, like a vein.}

<C>__{linda}
<D>__{come on, isabelle. you can do this.}
<A>__{sebastian lowers the hypo. the skin bonds and gives. the needle remains in sight after it slips through the visible surface. matt presses down on the hypo plunger, releasing a dye into his bloodstream. the gold liquid twists into a long snaking tube up and down the limb. it s the shape of a vein. the liquid begins to react. small flashes of light blip up and down the strand of color. ba bump.. ba bump... the heartbeat starts to speed up.}

<D>__{every time we've tried to bring a test subject back from phase shift. cellular bonds would dissolve, the primary dna strands would decay. but now...}
<A>__{sebastian pauses. something's bothering him.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{but now...}
<A>__{one of the senior advisers, dr. harry kramer, distinguished 50s, finally breaks the silence.}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{but now?}
<A>__{linda and matt look up at sebastian expectantly.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{but now...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{but now, we feel we are closer than ever to resolving this issue. we've been experimenting with a new regression formula that looks rather promising. a four star general leans forward.}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{how long?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{son, as you can imagine, we are very anxious to field test this tactical asset. how long till you resolve this issue?}
<A>__{linda starts to speak, but sebastian cuts her off with a look.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{shouldn't be more than another year, sir.}
<A>__{frustrated sighs all around the room.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{maybe sooner.}
<L>__{exterior pentagon day}
<A>__{as linda, matt and sebastian head to their cars.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yo. reality check! what the hell was that about?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{keep your voice down.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{the protocol works. why'd you tell them it didn't?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i wasn't ready for them to know.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{but they're the oversight committee. they're supposed to know.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i'm sure he had a reason.}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{you did have a reason, didn't you, sebastian?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i had more than a reason. i had a goddamn epiphany.}
<A>__{they reach his porsche.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{what do you think they'd do if they know we could send a subject into phase shift and pull it back out again? how many seconds would it take for them to take over the whole project, bringing in their soldiers to test the formula on. we'd have lost control of it by the end of the week.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{it's their money, sebastian. it's going to happen eventually.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i know. but not yet. there's too much for us to learn. i don't want my hands tied by their political agenda when we go to phase three.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{well, then... mind telling us how you're gonna get a human test subject for phase three without the committee finding out?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{that's easy. i've decided to test the procedure ...}
<L>__{interior laboratory conference room day}

<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{was jonas salk nuts?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah. pretty sure he was.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{and remember, for every jonas salk, there are a bunch of guys who aren't famous cuz they died.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{if we're that unsure, how can we morally justify testing it on someone else?}
<C>__{janice}
<D>__{isn't it a little soon to be moving into phase three anyway?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{she's right. we haven't even finished collating the phase two research.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{we'll have plenty of time to collate and cross reference later. monkey data doesn't matter anyway. the only real data is human data.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you don't even know if any of the protocols will work on humans.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{how are we gonna find out? besides, we've succeeded with a gorilla and their dna is 98% the same as humans. and the 2% is not that significant.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{sebastian ... humans can talk, build houses and cook in microwave ovens. gorilla's live in trees. that's a helluva 2% if you ask me.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{we're all concerned. i know that. but if we're gonna move forward ever, this is something we have to do.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{why you? why not one of us?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{the risks. i couldn't ask...}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{what if we volunteer?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{what if you're too valuable to lose?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i'm project leader. it's my formula and my call. the best way to express your concern is to make damn sure you do your best work. i will want about four weeks to...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{to put your affairs in order?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{to run some more reversions and tissue tests and then we'll attempt the phase shift. i will stay shifted for three days of testing and then we'll perform a quantum regression.}

<A>__{a knock on the door.}

<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{in the past six years, i've never once challenged your decisions, but this ... sebastian. i don't think you should do this.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{you don't understand.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{oh please. how long were we together? you must've said it a million times ... nobody knows who built the lunar lander. all they remember in the first man on the moon.}

<D>__{he refuses to listen to reason.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{can we talk about this later? i'm trying to make love to you.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{sorry. i just can't let it go.}
<A>__{matt props himself up on the pillow.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i know how you're feeling. hell, he and i've been friends since freshman year.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{so how can we let him do this?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what if you were given the opportunity to be the first person on ,mars, would you go?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{in a heartbeat.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what if they didn't know whether or not they could get you home?}
<A>__{linda thinks about it. it's still tempting.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{this is his chance to be chuck yeager or christopher columbus. well, if i were him i'd do the same thing.}
<A>__{matt goes back to kissing linda.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{let me ask another question.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{is about who gets to be on top?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{is the human race really ready for what we're doing?}
<A>__{matt groans and rolls over.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{why do you always get philosophical before we're about to get physical?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{no really. is it ready? we're barrelling down a road that begs moral and ethical questions that i don't think we can answer.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{they said the same thing about the bomb. they said we'd never survive the nuclear age... but here we are.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{this night is still young.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i mean, when you think about it, it's creepy. do we really want to live in a world where people can just disappear in the blink of an eye?}

<D>__{nervous?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{a little.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{ever tell you the one about superman and wonder woman?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{so superman's flying around the city, and he's horny as hell. lo and behold he looks down and sees wonder woman, completely nude, sunning herself up on the roof of the justice league. i mean she is lying there naked and spread eagle. so superman starts thinking, "man... this is too easy. i could go down there, do a little fast pumping and be gone before she even sees me." after all he is faster than a speeding bullet, right? anyway, he swoops down, takes care of business so quick, you can't even see him. well ... i tell ya. wonder woman looks up, surprised as hell and says "what the hell was that." and the invisible man replies "i dunno know, but it sure hurt like hell."}

<A>__{the buzz of conversation is punctuated by an amplified heartbeat, thumping its familiar rhythm. bah bump. bah bump. in the center of the room, sebastian, dressed only in a pair of jogging shorts is strapped to a table inclined at a 45 degree angle. electrodes are strapped to his body. an i.v. tube snakes from the needle in his vein up to a bag of saline solution. dripping slowly. linda makes last minute checks of some of the equipment. she pats sebastian on the shoulder.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{o.k. how're you feeling? sebastian takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{fine.}

<C>__{matt}
<D>__{any last words?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{yeah. if i'm killed, pretend i said something deep and clever.}

<C>__{linda}
<D>__{we've set up a thermal camera for observation and i've arranged one of us to be here 24 7 in case you need anything. the team's gonna be on alpha call alert for the duration. if anything goes wrong, we can all be here within...}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{thirty minutes. yes,,_i know. i wrote the procedure.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i was trying to be reassuring.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{you like this don't you?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{being in charge.}
<A>__{it's clear she does. but she's certainly not going to admit it.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{please. i'm just doing my job.}

<A>__{close on: a video screen. a thermal lump lays stretched out on the bed. pull back to reveal sarah staring at the screen. we are.}
<L>__{interior observation room night}
<A>__{a bank of monitors display the various angles of the hall of habitats, the laboratory and, of course, sebastian in the recovery room. linda hands sarah a cup of coffee.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{you gonna be okay?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{fine. it's not like i have anything else going on in my sad pathetic life.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{carter'll be in at six to spell you and i will be in by nine. call me if anything happens, okay?}
<A>__{through the glass wall, linda sees matt knocking and waving her out.}
<C>__{sarah}

<L>__{interior corridor night}
<A>__{the rest of the team straggles into the elevator. yawning. exhausted from the day.}

<C>__{linda}
<D>__{days only get longer from here.}
<A>__{linda catches matt's eye. gives him a look. "you coming over?" matt nods, "yes", imperceptible to everyone but linda. she smiles.}

<L>__{interior laboratory night}
<A>__{deserted and dark.}
<L>__{interior observation room night}
<A>__{late. sarah rubs her temples. her eyelids are heavy. she's having real trouble staying awake. the buzzing fluorescent light isn't helping either.}
<L>__{interior recovery room night}
<A>__{the sheets ruffle and the indentation disappears from the bed. we can hear breathing and soft sound of bare feet shuffling against linoleum. camera slowly pans toward the door, as if we, are following someone walking. the door handle turns and the door pushes open.}
<L>__{interior hallway of habitats night}
<A>__{we slowly track down the hallway of the habitats. we hear the sounds of sleeping creatures. a couple of them growl at something unseen. the growling follows the invisible something as it passes by.}
<L>__{interior laboratory night}
<A>__{the laboratory door opens and shuts again. ghostly. we see papers shuffling at one of the work stations. a glass moves slightly.}
<L>__{interior observation room night}
<A>__{sarah reclines in her chair. fast asleep, behind her is the glass wall, revealing the empty hallway behind it. but a small portion of the glass fogs, as if someone had just breathed on it. as the fogged part quickly clears, we see the door to the observation room quietly open. on sarah, still sleeping. we hear a whisper.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{sarah. are you awake?}
<A>__{her heavy breathing mixes with sebastian's.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice }
<P>__{(barely audible)}
<D>__{hmm.}
<A>__{sarah's hair moves slightly, as if a hand were running through it. and then we see her shirt move, like fingers were tracing over it. down from the shoulder to her breast. around her nipple. sarah moans slightly, as if she were dreaming, but she doesn't stir. and then her breasts cup slightly, as if they were being touched... softly... gently. her breathing becomes harder, more labored, erotic... and then she... bolts awake. bar eyes wide with fear. she jumps and cups her own breasts and looks around the room. it's empty, of course. she jumps over to the monitor and checks on sebastian's room. the heat signature isn't there.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{dr. caine! goddamnit, dr. caine! are you in here?}
<A>__{she listens. it's silent. she tries holding her breath, listening for his breathing. but there's nothing. sarah reaches over to a microphone. hits a few switches.}

<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{she looks around the room. he must be in here.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{dr. caine? sebastian? come on, this isn't funny. i know you're in here.}
<A>__{nothing. no response. sarah waves her hand around, reaching out, trying to find him. after a few beats she stops and rubs her head.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{i must be going crazy.}
<A>__{suddenly, sarah gets an idea. she quickly exits the observation room.}
<L>__{exterior corridor night}
<A>__{at a wall storage box, she removes a pair of thermal goggles and slips them on.}
<L>__{interior observation room night}
<A>__{sarah enters wearing the thermals. she scans the room. thermal pov the room is empty. she pulls the goggles off in frustration, and when she glances over at the video screen, she sees sebastian's thermal image lying on the bed in the recovery room. sarah sinks into her chair, a tad disconcerted.}
<L>__{interior observation room morning}
<A>__{linda and matt finish listening to sarah's story.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i found him later in the lab, running samples.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{why didn't you call me?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{because i wasn't sure. i'm still not. i mean, i could've easily been dreaming.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it doesn't sound like something sebastian would do.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{god, i feel so stupid.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i can talk to him.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{no. i mean...}
<P>__{(she torn, unsure of herself)}
<D>__{it was probably nothing. i shouldn't've mentioned it.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you sure?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{yeah, i'm sure. i mean, y'know, why would he do that, right? just, this place at night can be kinda creepy, y'know.}
<L>__{interior research lab day}
<A>__{sebastian, wearing surgical scrubs sits in an examination chair. wire leads sprout from the electrodes covering his head and arms. the electrodes seem to outline his body.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{so, how was your first night?}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{restless. hard to sleep when you can't close your eyes.}
<A>__{as sebastian talks, we can see the electrodes around his jaw pump up and down.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yeah? what'd you do?}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{got up a couple of times. knocked about.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yeah, sarah mentioned you weren't in your cubicle. she said she called you over the intercom and you didn't respond.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i guess i didn't hear. i had the radio on.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it'd be helpful to us if you'd tell whoever's on duty where you're going to. i mean, if something were to happen, we'd want to know where to find you.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i didn't think it was a problem.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it isn't. i just don't want it to become one.}
<A>__{machines pump out eeg, ekg readouts. matt studies them.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{readings are normal.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{next i want to run a vv and uvf analysis of the platelets.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{we'll have to draw some more blood.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{sarah rolls up sebastian's sleeve, revealing empty air. she wraps a bungee cord around the nothing, pulls it tight and sprays the inside of his elbow with dye. she acts very self conscious.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{yeah. why?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{you just seem a little nervous.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{no. i...i'm fine. hold still. this might hurt a bit.}
<A>__{the surface of his skin sheens in the light as linda searches for a vein. she slaps his arm several times, then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin. his skin bends and gives. the needle remains in sight after it slips through the visible surface. sarah presses down on the hypo plunger, releasing a dye into his bloodstream.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{dr. caine... this might sounds stupid, but are you... are you looking at me.}
<A>__{the red dye twists into a long snaking red tube up and down his arm. his vein.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{no. i was looking at the clock. why?}
<A>__{sarah draws the plunger back, sucking sebastian's blood into the hypodermic and then yanks the needle out.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{just felt like someone was staring at me.}
<A>__{sarah pulls the vial off the needle and labels it with a grease pencil. after a few beats the red dye in sebastian's blood stream dissolves and disappears, as does the liquid in the vial.}

<L>__{interior mri room}
<A>__{matt slides sebastian's sheet covered frame into an mri. even though his head is not visible, it shown up on the mri scanner.}
<L>__{interior main laboratory}
<A>__{carter and sarah lower a harness into a water tank. sebastian's body displaces the water, revealing an empty body shaped cavity in the water.}
<L>__{interior observation room}
<A>__{carter sips a big gulp and stares at a monitor which shows two eat signatures in the recovery chamber, huddled over a chess game.}
<L>__{interior recover chamber}
<A>__{on a chessboard... a black knight takes white bishop, seemingly all by itself. across the table, matt leans back and topples his white king acknowledging defeat.}
<L>__{interior spectral lab}
<A>__{dim lights. janice and frank both don eye guards. frank switches on a low intensity laser on and it's beam shoots across the room. the beam distorts slightly in the center of the room. as frank widens the spectral pattern, suddenly the beam splits into a million different spectral rainbows, momentary illuminating sebastian's entire frame in a glowing tingle of light.}
<L>__{interior main laboratory}
<A>__{linda pulls vials from the cyclotrons and props blood sample slides. she slips them under the microscope. she takes a sip of her diet coke and puts it on the table. she pears into the microscope and analyses the blood sample, squeezing more stain onto it. she looks up to make notations, but when she reaches for her diet coke it isn't there. she looks around. it's on the other side of her microscope. she shrugs it off, she takes a sip and sets it down where it was before. she peers into the microscope again and when she looks up... the diet coke is gone. she looks around the room and sees it on another table completely.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{sebastian? goddamnit.}
<A>__{we hear sebastian's laughter echo in the room.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{you've no idea how much fun i've had. i'm going to hate going back.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{that's what worries me.?}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{how so?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{what happens when we turn the project over to the army. ever wonder how much fun they're gonna have?}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{maybe we won't give it to them. his voice comes from behind her now.}
<A>__{we see indentations on her shoulders where his fingers press down.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice }
<D>__{i was thinking... tonight's my last night. ever fantasize about making love to an invisible man?}
<A>__{linda pulls away from him.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{stop it, sebastian. it's not funny.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{well, don't do it for me. do it for science.}
<A>__{linda walks away. sebastian laughs.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{grow up.}

<D>__{oh well. missed your big chance.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{got some sleep. big day tomorrow.}
<L>__{interior laboratory day}
<A>__{a bevy of activity below us as the scientists prepare. matt slides the antigen cocktail into the centrifuge and starts it spinning. a sheet drapes over a sebastian's frame, straps across his limbs. he is fully wired. linda looks up to the observation booth.}

<D>__{de phase protocol. injecting serial protein caine one two seven.}

<D>__{not really. i was just starting to enjoy myself.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{tough.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{okay, man. here we go.}
<A>__{matt inserts the hypo into the vein and presses down on the plunger. the liquid begins to react. small flashes of light blip up and down the strand of color outlining the vein. ba bump.. ba bump... the heartbeat starts to speed up.}

<A>__{sarah preps a tranquilizer. sebastian locks eyes with linda. he's lost, he doesn't know where he is. and suddenly, he crumbles to the ground. linda rushes over to him and puts bar hand on his shoulder. light bleeds from his skin and his skin begins to dissolve from sight.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{he's reverting. got him on the table.}
<A>__{matt, linda and sarah pull the shifting body up and onto an operating table. carter pulls himself up and heads back to the group.}

<A>__{carter locates sebastian's heart, not a difficult thing because we can actually see it. carter's hand pushes down in the air inches above the heart. we see the heart being pushed and squeezed. sarah slaps an air bag on sebastian and starts pumping air into his lungs. sebastian's heart begins to beat again, beat on its own.}

<C>__{kramer }
<D>__{hello? hello?}
<A>__{kramer crosses to the darkened kitchen. the kitchen door leading to the backyard is open. puzzled, he crosses to it. a wind stirs across the pool and backyard, swirling dead leaves in small twists of wind. the windchime rings lightly. kramer steps out.}
<L>__{exterior pool patio, backyard night}
<A>__{in the dim spillover light from house, kramer crosses to the telephone box against the back of the house. it is open and several of the wires have been pulled. he looks around, spooked and puffs out a cloud of smoke from his pipe. for the briefest of instants, sebastian's face is visible in the smoke. kramer jumps back in surprise and the pipe drops from his mouth. he gives a small sharp cry, but deep indentations appear across his mouth and his cries are stifled. in the darkness, we can make out his form writhing as if possessed. the struggle continues a beat until kramer manages to break free.}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{help! help! martha! help!}
<A>__{as kramer runs, he looks behind him. but no one's there. wham! something slams into kramer and he tumbles, rolling into the pool. but as he hits water there's not just one splash, but two. in the water next to him is human shaped air pocket. it's sebastian displacing the water. and because of the water displacement, we can clearly see two arms pushing kramer beneath the water's surface. martha kramer opens the bedroom window and looks down at the pool. all she can see is her husband drowning... his flailing limbs kicking up a massive air bubble around him. she races from the window. kramer kicks and flails for a few moments and then his limbs stop moving. a moment later he floats to surface, face down. the air pocket bobs over to the pool ladder, and rising from the pool, we see sebastian's body outlined in sheets of water. the shape melts away in a cascading waterfall until all we can see of sebastian are the hundreds of tiny droplets still clinging to his body, caught in the light like twinkling bulbs on a christmas tree. the shape disappears into the darkness. a moment later martha emerges from the house and sees her husband floating face down in the pool. she screams.}

<D>__{where is he?}
<L>__{interior observation room continuous}
<A>__{linda huddled over the screen. tense.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{he's coming right at you!}

<C>__{matt}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{twenty, maybe thirty feet.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{goddamnit, i got thermals all over the place. eight, maybe ten of them. must be ghosts.}
<L>__{interior observation room continuous}
<A>__{linda gets a sense of forboding. she looks around the room. sees a heating vent in the corner. beat. she grabs the walkie.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{those signatures ... they're coming from the heating vents.}
<A>__{through the goggles, matt sees the tunnel turning red.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i'm starting to lose resolution on my thermals.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{get out of there!}
<L>__{interior observation room}

<C>__{linda}
<D>__{do it.}
<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{matt turns to face the corridor. it's turning red. matt sees some movement in the thermal cloud. opens fire. but the thermal signature disappears into the heat. matt can't distinguish anything through his goggles anymore. he pulls them off and holds him gun in front of him sweeping the hallway.}

<C>__{sebastian's voice }
<D>__{not even close.}
<A>__{matt sweeps his front leg back and forth, like a blind man using a cane. but his foot isn't hitting anything. he sees a fire extinguisher mounted on the wall. he rushes it, turns it on the hallway and sprays. and something lunges through the foam. grabs him, sending him tumbling down the tunnel. matt is thrown against the wall. blood coming from his brow. he scrambles away, spraying more foam. sees a shape in the mist, raises his pistol and fires. the shape leaps away. the dart flies. doesn't hit. matt scrambles back into a corner. his pistol is empty.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{so... just out of curiosity, how long has my best friend been fucking my ex girlfriend.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{sebastian. get a hold of yourself. you aren't thinking rationally.}

<C>__{matt}
<D>__{calm down, sebastian... we can talk this through. it's not too late.}

<D>__{this way.}

<C>__{frank}
<D>__{he'll be okay.}

<C>__{sarah }

<A>__{spooked, sarah bursts into the room. she goes to the supply fridge freezer, pulls open the door, and sorts through blood bags.}
<L>__{interior tunnel}
<A>__{matt and linda push along the corridor; matt spraying with the fire extinguisher in short controlled bursts, linda clutching her tranquilizer like a commando. a noise behind them. footsteps. matt turns to blast with the extinguisher. the white chemical dust sprays out, outlining a shape in the tunnel. but it isn't a human shape. matt's uniform shreds. something with fierce sharp claws fells him. tearing into his flesh. we see a angry, hungry face... jabbing for a moment through the lingering fog.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{ahh! shit!}
<A>__{linda tries to get a clear shot off through the smoke. matt trips and goes sprawling. something yelps. a howl. linda shoots. her dart jabs into something which collapses to the ground. a moment of calm. as the dusty chemical foam settles, the outline of a great ape appears, still twitching.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{karl three. nice shot.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{he's let the animals out. it wasn't him we were tracking.}
<A>__{linda leans against the wall, still clutching her tranq gun at the ready. the heat is getting to bar. bar scrubs are soaked, her hair's a mess. she wipes the sweat from her brow.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it won't kill me unless it gets infected. you?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{me .... don't ask about me. if he freed all the animals, we could have dozens running around the lab.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{so he could be anywhere right now.}
<A>__{matt sprays the whole tunnel, putting down a gentle cloud mist. nothing else appears.}
<C>__{matt }

<C>__{sarah }
<P>__{(frightened whisper)}
<D>__{who's there?}
<A>__{she listens. is that breathing she hears? now she's starting to panic.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{dr. caine?}
<A>__{she starts to back away, but she's already in the corner. she clutches her tranquilizer gun, but there's nothing to aim at. the vials of blood on the shelf gives her an idea. she reaches over, grabs a vial and throws it on the floor. glass shatters and blood smears across the linoleum. sarah tosses another vial and another. becoming more and more hysterical. splattering more and more blood. but she runs out of vials. shaking with fear, she searches the blood looking for a footprint, or movement. but there's nothing there. sarah waits a beat, clutching the tranquilizer gun. takes a step. waits a beat longer. finally she relaxes. it was just her imagination. she heads toward the door when she hears a terrifying whisper in her ear.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{you missed.}
<A>__{her hair flies up, and she swings against the wall. she tries to move, but she's pinned there. her hands struggling against the force.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{please no. let me go. oh god, let me go.}
<A>__{the arm holding the tranquilizer gun begins to move.}
<C>__{sarah }

<A>__{sarah fights, but her arm moves nonetheless}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{help me! oh god. somebody help me! frank!}
<A>__{slowly, deliberately, her own arm moves down the wall and around, until the tranquilizer gun points right at her stomach. sarah watches in horror as her own body betrays her.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{no... please. don't do this to me.}
<A>__{she struggles, shaking back and forth. writhing. in anguish and in fear.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{you.}
<A>__{the trigger pulls .... pop! a dart explodes from the gun and imbeds in sarah's stomach. she whimpers as her eyes glass over. suddenly she's released. she stumbles backward and falls lifeless to the floor. a moment of stillness, all we can hear is the sound of someone breathing. on sarah's face... a slight indentation runs down her cheek.. almost sweet... almost tender. and slight indentation runs across her breast and strokes down her body. the sense of violation and vulnerability is awful. sebastian sighs.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{i've always liked your feistiness.}
<A>__{sarah's head shifts slightly. her head shifts violently, accompanied by the celery crunch of her neck snapping. sebastian exhales, his breath filled with the intoxication of power.}

<C>__{frank }

<C>__{linda}
<D>__{where is she?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{she went to the supply room. carter needed blood.}
<A>__{linda grabs a stethoscope and listens to carter's heart.}
<C>__{linda}

<C>__{frank}
<D>__{she didn't listen.}

<D>__{he's dead.}
<A>__{linda would love to cry about it, but doesn't afford herself the luxury.}

<A>__{the group breaks into a run. linda pushes into the chamber and falls at sarah's side. matt cradles sarah's head. they look for some sign of life as linda fights back the tears.}

<C>__{sebastian's voice}

<D>__{where?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{sebastian!}

<C>__{linda }
<D>__{sebastian. sebastian, listen to me.}
<A>__{no response. they all their tranq pistols level waiting for some sign. hearing each other breathe. they slowly move outside the chamber into the corridor.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{i don't know if you can understand this, but what you're experiencing is a psychological breakdown. this isn't who you are.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{i would say that what i am experiencing is psychological awareness. i like you being in complete and absolute control.}
<A>__{they identify the general area the voice is coming from: back inside the chamber! they slowly move toward the chamber door. with lightning speed they slam the door shut, locking sebastian inside the recovery chamber.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{you goddamn bastard! you goddamn bastard. you're gonna pay for this. i'm going to bring you back to visibility and then i'm going throw your ass in jail.}

<D>__{sebastian? sebastian? no.. no...}

<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{figured it out? you were always so clever.}
<A>__{matt's pulled back across the lab by the cord around his neck. he grabs at the cord trying to breathe. linda watches him being pulled away.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{she clamors over to him. but matt rises in the air and is tossed against the lab table. linda levels her dart pistol and fires haphazardly at the air. she hits nothing but objects jerk and move in a line as sebastian heads for cover. linda manages to grab matt and pull him to her.}

<C>__{linda}
<D>__{how can you be so brutal?}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{i guess because i don't have to look at myself in the mirror anymore}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{remember that first night i was out? i did something bad, just to see if i could get away with it. and when i did, i realized i could have it all. i can kill in broad daylight. and nobody's gonna tell the police they were fucked by a ghost. anything i desire i can make happen, but not if people know.}

<A>__{linda feels the rumbling as she places the coil up against the door. the magnet attaches itself. linda shakes the coil, trying to get the doorlock to move. outside the door we see the lock twitching. shaking... inside the door linda shivers as she plays with the coil. her eyes glaze and she stumbles backward. her surgical scrubs, once soaked with sweat, are now frozen stiff. she composes herself and pushes back toward the door. her heavy breath hangs as a low cloud of mist.}
<L>__{interior laboratory day}
<A>__{sebastian looks over the dozens of other test tubes, calculating their combined power in his mind. then he closes the top of the centrifuge. he taps a few commands into its timer.}
<L>__{interior supply room}
<A>__{the door lock twitches again and twists back. the door swings opens and linda stumbles out, mashing into a supply shelf of oxygen canisters. the canisters tumble every which way as linda tumbles to the ground. she scrambles to her feet and goes in after matt, pulling his cold body out of the storage locker. she pulls stacks of paper down from, the shelves into a trashcan, grabs an industrial lighter and ignites the paper. she pushes matt close to the small bonfire. as she does, the oxygen tanks catch her eye.}
<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{sebastian exits the lab, locking the door behind him. he heads down the darkened tunnel. something scampers in front of him. small, not visible. sebastian sends it reeling with a swift violent kick.}
<L>__{interior corridor, by the elevator day}
<A>__{sebastian, dressed and in full latex, comes striding up the tunnel. he taps a code into the elevator vault doors. the vault doors open revealing the elevator. the doors slide open and sebastian steps inside.}
<C>__{elevator}
<D>__{authorization please?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{caine. one one one one one.}
<C>__{elevator}
<D>__{authorization valid. thank you.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{sebastian!}
<A>__{and there's linda. slicked with dirt and blood. she holds a oxygen container with a cut line.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{i can't let you leave. come on out and i will give you one last chance.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{you said it yourself, lin. i shouldn't hold on to the past.}
<A>__{the door starts to shut.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{aaaaaaahhhh!}
<A>__{she hits the top of a lighter duct taped to the hose. a line of pressurized fire blows into the elevator. wwhhhoooosshhhh! sebastian goes up in flame. linda runs toward the elevator. just as the door's about to close, she slides. her foot jamming into it. she lets loose with the flame again. sebastian, backed into the corner, has no where to go. he's yelling in pain. his latex face bubbles and burns. the surgical scrubs singe black. with no other escape route, he dives toward the door. linda looks up to see his flaming body fly over her, back into the corridor. linda kills the tank as sebastian continues to burn. the elevator lights flickers and the security panel goes up in a shower of sparks. the elevator dies. linda pulls herself to her feet and turns to see... half of sebastian's head melted away, his latex facade a gruesome smoke damaged mass. his clothes are half burned revealing large blistering bubbly welts underneath, like deformed blackened bubble wrap. sebastian crawls to his feet, but linda hits him with another shot of flame. sebastian pulls at his clothes as he crawls around the corner.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{oh god!}
<A>__{linda stalks toward him.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{you wanna see god? i will show you god.}
<A>__{linda turns the corner to see a heap of smoldering latex and clothing strewn about the corridor floor. sebastian, looking like some ugly creature, pushes down the corridor. he throbs with his blackened skin blistering and cracking up and down his body. linda lets loose another jet of flame. it's smaller than the first and doesn't quite hit sebastian. linda checks the tanks pressure gauge. it slowly drops. linda follows the blackened horror into the maze of tunnels. but as he pushes along the corridor, his burns slowly re absorb themselves. sebastian is no longer visible. a quiet moment in the hallway as linda realizes how vulnerable she is. she looks around for him desperately. nothing. but something on the ceiling catches her attention. she blasts it with the last jet of her dying torch. the sprinkler system, hit by fire, comes to life. water sprays down on the tunnel. sebastian is caught in the downpour, his invisible frame outlined by water. it comes toward her, the hot skin steaming in the water. he grabs linda and slams her against the wall. his watery hand smashes her across her face. linda reels. on the floor, she looks to see sebastian stalking toward her. she crawls away, but he grabs her by her hair, pulls her to her feet and slams her against the wall.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i'm gonna find everyone in your family and kill them . your sister... she never liked me. i think i will go after her and her little boy first.}
<A>__{sebastian smashes her head against a metal post. her head cuts open, blood dripping down.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{i just wanted you to know that before you die.}
<A>__{linda collapses to the floor. sebastian's foot presses against her neck, squeezing it. linda gags for breath. but through the shoot of water that is sebastian, we see something also... a watery smudge. bam! matt smashes sebastian with the metal bar. sebastian slams against the corridor wall and sinks down. matt staggers. it's taken all his strength to got there. he drops the crowbar and seeks the wall for support, he sinks to his knees by linda.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{thought i'd... thought i'd save you for a change.}
<A>__{he gives her his hand and pulls her up into his arms.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{let's got out of here.}
<A>__{just as the two turn, sebastian rises with the crowbar. he swings it with a yell. matt pushes linda out of the way, his arm glancing the blow into a conduit. the conduit splits open and severs electrical wiring. the voltage shoots up the crowbar and into sebastian. as the current pulses through his body, sebastian vibrates. his blood vessels yank back to visibility, followed by his skeletal structure and major organs. sebastian is slowly electrified. smoke pours off him and he becomes more and more visible. finally he collapses. his body throbbing in and out of visibility. matt and linda stumble away.}
<L>__{interior corridor day}
<A>__{just outside the lab... linda tries to pry open the sealed doors with the crowbar. but she can't. through the doors porthole she sees a collection of chemicals and the fire raging from the earlier explosion.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{nitro...}
<A>__{matt peaks inside.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{he said it himself... all they'll find is a pile of charred corpses.}
<A>__{she sees the centrifuge... the timed counter on its face counts down from a minute. fifty nine. fifty eight. fifty seven...}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{he's rigged the centrifuge.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{in an enclosed space, he'll wipe out the whole lab.}
<L>__{interior tunnel}
<A>__{linda and matt move as fast as they can. they reach the burned out elevator. what the hell are they gonna do? we know the damn thing doesn't work. she swings her crowbar at the ceiling. the maintenance hatch comes down.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{grab on.}
<A>__{linda hooks the crowbar onto the hatch lip and pulls herself up. she reaches back down for matt.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{forget about me. you go.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{fuck you. give me your hands.}
<A>__{linda grabs matt's hands and pulls for all she's worth. she struggles, but they both manage to got him through the hatch.}
<L>__{interior laboratory day}
<A>__{three... two... one. the centrifuge springs to life. the centrifuge spins the two dozen vials slowly at first.}
<L>__{interior vent}
<A>__{linda and matt are on top of the elevator. linda's hands search the wall. bar fingers run across the smooth metal surface. from the little light below she can see a maintenance ladder that spans the entire height of the vertical tube. they look up and see it disappear into the darkness.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{climb!}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{but...}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{climb!}
<A>__{matt starts up, rung after rung. linda climbs right behind him.}
<L>__{interior laboratory}
<A>__{the centrifuge spins faster and faster. the vials are starting to rattle.}
<L>__{interior elevator shaft}
<A>__{linda and matt pull themselves up the ladder as quick as they can.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i can't. i'm going to pass out.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{keep moving.}
<A>__{he does, through sheer force of will. blood from his wound drips down on linda's face. no telling how much further they have to go in this darkness. light leaks in from the maintenance hatch below.}
<L>__{interior laboratory}
<A>__{the centrifuge's whine has reached a fevered pitch. the vials shake violently. then... one of the vials shatters. a flash of light. a huge explosion rips through the laboratory.}
<L>__{interior tunnel}
<A>__{the explosion rips through the lab doors. a massive fireball rolls down the tunnel swallowing everything in its path. one of the phase shifted animals gets caught in the flames. we see its shape briefly before it disappears in a wall of fire.}
<L>__{interior elevator shaft}
<A>__{the ladder begins to shake. the entire shaft begins to rumble. linda pushes matt up as they scramble toward safety.}
<L>__{interior exhaust vent}
<A>__{the fireball blows into the vent. starts rolling down it also.}
<L>__{interior tunnels}
<A>__{more explosions. chain reactions. boom! boom! boom! the explosions rolls toward the open elevator. slamming into it... the elevator flies upward.}
<L>__{interior elevator shaft}
<A>__{the rumbling worsens. the two desperately cling to the ladder. they looks down to see... the elevator... surrounded by flames flying up toward them, lifted by the explosion's shock waves.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{oh god!}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{don't look.}
<A>__{the carriage accelerates toward them, faster and faster. its loose cables whip around the shaft, slapping the walls around the pair. its gonna hit them! linda pulls herself close to the ladder and closes her eyes. she's pressed against matt. the elevator... 50 feet... 40 ...}
<L>__{30 ... w0000000sh! it flames right by them.}
<A>__{when linda opens her eyes, the elevator is hundreds of feet above them and a wall of fire is below them, closing in.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{move!}
<A>__{panicked, linda pushes matt up the ladder as she stares down at the rising fire wall. but the fire dissipates before it hits them, though a stray tongue of flames reaches up to lick the soles of her feet. they hear a terrifying moan and looks up to see the elevator peaking far above her. it slows to a stop and}
<B>__{begins to fall.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it's coming down!}
<A>__{faster and faster. coming back toward them in complete free fall. it's emergency brakes clamp down, slowing it. metal against metal. sparks flying. one of the brakes shears. then another. the elevator unseats from it's tracks, slamming against the walls as it tumbles. linda sees that the elevator is out of control, and watches as it ping pongs toward them... smashing into the access ladder, smashing into the wall. the elevator slows, but continues slamming side to side. linda cringes as the elevator crashes into the wall above them. but it jams there, stopping. they pull their heads away from wall and look up. the elevator just hangs there, suspended. there's a small crawlspace between the elevator and the ladder.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{c'mon. before it slips.}
<A>__{they begins to climb up again. matt shimmies through the tight hollow, and squeezes out the other side, followed by linda. she breathes a sigh of relief and just hangs there a moment when ... ah! something grabs her. a singed throbbing hand emerges from the darkness, gripping at her leg.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{it's him.}
<A>__{she kicks at it and sees a dark dirty face a swirl of dirt, grime and smoke with hollow eyes rise up the ladder.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{sebastian, you fuck.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{get off me.}
<A>__{sebastian pulls himself up linda's body. translucent dirty hands paving at the fabric of her clothes. linda tries to climb with this thing on her. but sebastian grabs her around the neck. she begins choking for breath. linda fights to keep her grip on the ladder... she looks down at the ten foot drop to the elevator and then... she lets go!}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{she and sebastian plummet through the smoky haze and slam against the top of the elevator. linda seems to hover a few above the elevator, sebastian's shadowy outline below her. matt painfully lowers himself down the ladder. but metal groans and the elevator drops another five feet. linda struggles to her feet. sebastian rises. a menacing dark figure stalking toward her. linda pushes back from him. sebastian grabs her by the hair and pulls bar over to the ladder. the elevator strains and groans.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{let go of me.}
<A>__{sebastian presses her up against the ladder. presses into her from behind. he has her trapped. his dirty hand reaches out and strokes her hair.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{remember the day we met? you were wearing a red dress and you were so pretty. now... now look at you.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{get off of her!}
<A>__{sebastian pulls her hair back and kisses her neck with his filthy, dirt smeared mouth and half burned away face.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{sebastian, stop it.}
<A>__{linda and sebastian struggle. matt reaches down to try and grab her, help her.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{you fucked it all up.}
<A>__{linda looks at her feet. the last elevator emergency brake grips its cable. she grits her tooth and grabs hold of the ladder.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{go to hell.}
<A>__{linda stamps on the brake release. the elevator tumbles ... along with sebastian. it slams into the fiery abyss a hundred yards below. linda hangs, one hand holding onto the ladder, the other holding onto matt. matt pulls her back onto the ladder, using all his remaining strength.}
<L>__{exterior warehouse day}
<A>__{linda and matt stumble out into the blazing sunshine. emergency crews close from all directions, sirens roaring. a trail of smoke drifts higher and higher into the sky. an ambulance pulls up next to them and the paramedics hop out, immediately putting a blanket around her and treating matt's wounds.}
<C>__{marine guard}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{we lived.}
<A>__{linda looks over her shoulder at the traces of the ruin and she sees a shimmer of heat rising from the ground... almost as if something was there.}
