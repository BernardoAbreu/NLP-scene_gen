<L>__{interior jacob's bedroom}
<A>__{jacob is lying on the floor of his bedroom doing exercises for his back. he has several days' growth of beard and does not look well. his mind is drifting and only the occasional pain in his back reminds him of what he is doing. jezzie can be heard vacuuming the carpet in the living room. suddenly the door swings open. the wail of the vacuum cleaner causes jacob to tense. his eyes drift down from the ceiling. jezzie vacuums around him and seems insensitive to his presence. jezzie shoves the vacuum cleaner under the bed and hits something. jacob tightens. she looks and is shocked to discover a can of gasoline and boxes of kitchen matches. it takes her a second to understand the implications of what she has found. jacob is ready when she begins yelling.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{you're completely off your rocker, you know that? you'd think you fell on your head instead of your back. what are you planning to do, burn down the apartment along with your demons?}
<A>__{she begins to remove the gasoline can.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{don't you touch it.}
<P>__{(he glares at her)}
<A>__{jezzie lets go of the can and grabs the vacuum. she moves it furiously across the carpet. suddenly jacob sees her tongue darting in and out, unconsciously. she looks strange, not human. jacob freezes. he yells out.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{the sound of the vacuum cleaner drowns out his voice. he yells again. jezzie sees him and turns off the machine. his voice booms out.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{who the hell are you?}
<A>__{jezzie ignores the question and turns the vacuum cleaner back on. jacob rolls over and pulls out the plug.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{why won't you answer me?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{cause you know goddamn well who i am.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i don't know you.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{you've lived with me for two years.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{that doesn't mean shit. where do you come from, huh? and i don't mean indiana.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{what do you want me to say? my mother's tummy?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you know goddamn well what i mean.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{you're out of your fucking mind. i'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{well leave then. go to hell.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{you son of a bitch. who do you think you are? i don't deserve this. who takes care of you day and night? who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? well, i've had it. you flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. i'm done holding your hand. i don't want anything to do with you, you hear? nothing!}
<A>__{she storms out of the room, kicking the vacuum cleaner as she goes. jacob can see flashes of her through the open crack of the bedroom door. occasional curses and epithets hurl through the opening along with a flood of tears. jacob catches glimpses of her as she grabs her coat from the hall closet and as she pulls her money out of the desk drawer. he can see the lamp as she shoves it to the floor and hears it shatter as she stomps on it with her foot. there is a blur as she heads to the front door and a deafening bang as she leaves. jacob's eyes drift up to the ceiling. they hardly blink. he stares at the plaster, chipped and cracked, above him. suddenly the cracks begin to move. jacob jumps up. a demon is materializing over his head. jacob yells and grabs hold of the extension pole for the vacuum cleaner. with a furious cry he begins jamming it at the ceiling. rather than blot out the evolving image his attack helps to define it. jacob slams harder. plaster and wood lath cover the floor. the demon is gone. panting hard, jacob reaches for matches and the gasoline can. he stops and stares at them with great intensity. addendum 8: the antidote sequence the ceiling begins to rumble. cracks split wide open. huge crevasses tear through the plaster. jacob's world is crumbling. he stares in horror as demonic forms attempt to surge through the rupture above him. piercing eyes and sharp teeth glimmer in the darkness. hooved feet and pointed claws clamor to break through.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{help me!}
<A>__{instantly michael appears standing over him. he is holding the vial with the antidote. he draws an eyedropper full of the fluid and holds it over jacob's mouth.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{take it!}
<A>__{jacob fights him but michael forces the entire contents of the eyedropper down his throat. jacob gags. he tries to spit it out, but can't. suddenly the ceiling erupts in violent clashes as whole chunks break off and collide with one another like continental plates. the collisions wreak havoc on the demons, chopping and dismembering them. body parts fall from the ceiling like a devil's rain. horrible screams echo from the other side. flashes of light and dark storm over jacob's head, thundering like a war in the heavens. it is a scene of raw power and growing catastrophe. it builds in fury and rage until suddenly the ceiling explodes. matter atomizes instantly. trillions of particles hurl chaotically in all directions. the walls shatter into a dazzling brightness. for a moment there is a sense of intense forward movement, a rush toward oblivion. and then, suddenly, it stops. there is absolute quiet and stillness. jacob's eyes stare into the formlessness sparkling around him. all space has become a shining void. gradually faint pastel colors appear like colored molecules, dancing and spinning, redirecting space into new formations. they weave patterns of intricate complexity and stunning beauty. as the colors grow brighter and more vivid their abstraction gives way to solid form. a garden scene emerges. it is a garden of light, a vast, almost mythic, rousseau paradise. it radiates an intense shimmering light. jacob's eyes are cpativated by the vision before him. a sudden movement catches his attention. he looks up and notices michael still standing beside him. michael, however, is rapidly changing form. it is a full, plastic, three dimensional metamorphosis. his very flesh seems to expand and glow with its own inner light. his face shines and radiates an almost transcendental beauty. jacob is nearly blinded by michael's presence and must shield his eyes to look at him. michael smiles an extraordinary and joyous smile that radiates such intense luminosity that jacob has to squint to see it. suddenly michael steps off the ground. he rises into the air and floats above jacob. jacob can barely breathe as he watches him. michael rises into a sky filled with orbs and blazing lights. the lights shine on jacob's head. he effervesces and shimmers in their glow. one of the orbs sends a burst of light exploding over jacob. so intense is the light that jacob grabs his eyes. as he opens them again he sees that the garden is fading back into pure light. michael, too, is fading. another burst of light and the garden is reabsorbed by the void. only the brightness remains. it is many seconds before we realize that the hotel room is coming together, reconstructed by the light. in moments it is fully formed. sunlight is pouring through the window. michael is sleeping lightly in a chair. he hears jacob stare and sits up. jacob is sitting on the bed. he does not seem to know where he is. his eyes are filled with awe. they move slowly around the room, taking everything in. he doesn't speak. michael gets up and sits beside him. he respects his silence. addendum 9: hotel room }
