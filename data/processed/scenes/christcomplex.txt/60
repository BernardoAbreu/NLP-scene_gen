<D>__{this is fucked. quinn you're not 5000 years old. you were born in an orphanage. none of this makes sense.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{lady, it would look weird if we roamed the earth for 5000 years without facing a mortal death! we keep getting reborn, sometimes we even switch physical form. thanks for coming to the game late missy!}

<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{i'm going to be honest with you louis. i've always been honest.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{yeah sometimes to a fault.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{we have always played this game as honest as we could. we never did anything to undermine the other. despite what you represent, you have moral code.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you are not acting with in that code today.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i'm tired of losing...}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{you're losing right now. your actions, you can't win like this. not acting this way.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i'm tired of you. i'm going to end it!}
<A>__{louis goes over to ryan. he trades his sword in for ryan's gun. ryan holds the katana to zoey's throat. louis points the gun dead at quinn.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{you going to shoot me?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{it's the endgame.}
<A>__{tense moment as louis aims the gun at quinn. suddenly he spins and shoots ryan dead in the head. ryan falls and zoey gets free. louis looks at quinn and then throws the gun far out into the field.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{ok...i guess i do have some morals.}
<A>__{zoey gets her bearings.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{what the fuck!}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{zoey go home. we need to finish this.}

<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{i will always love you. you have to go though.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{if you don't walk away from this field right now, you will lose me. i will not be in your corner. i will call for help. they will stop you.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{go...}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{quinn...last chance.}
<A>__{zoey walks over to ryan's body. she searches till she finds her cell phone in his front pocket.}
<C>__{zoey }
<D>__{i will call the police quinn...}
<A>__{quinn looks at zoey, dead in the eyes.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{goodbye.}
<A>__{quinn turns toward louis. he pulls his katana up to attack position and louis follows suit.}
<C>__{zoey}
<P>__{(tearing up)}
<D>__{wow...yeah goodbye.}
<A>__{quinn and louis charge each other. zoey doesn't bother to stay to watch the battle. she slowly walks away. quinn and louis' swords meet. the clang is triumphant. details of this climatic battle will be choreographed by the actors involved, but think high flying shaw brothers film. we don't see a clear victor, just the two boys going at it until we can't tell who is who. other side of the field away from the battle zoey starts to make a call on her cell phone. close shot cell phone she starts to dial 911. her thumb moves in the position to hit send.}
<B>__{other side of the field}
<A>__{zoey stops. she slowly puts her phone away. she looks back toward where the battle is going on. she starts to walk back. the walk turns into a jog. finally the jog turns into a full run.}
<B>__{open field}
<A>__{when she gets to the field quinn and louis are gone. all that can be seen is ryan blood's body, two katanas and an empty ninja suit. zoey leans down and touches quinn's katana.}
<C>__{zoey}
<P>__{(laughs to herself)}
<D>__{i am curious:yellow}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{goodbye boys...}
<A>__{zoey stares out into the open field. she feels reborn. she knows there is a new world, a new perspective for her beyond the horizon.}
