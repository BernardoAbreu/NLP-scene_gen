<T>__{jump to:}
<L>__{exterior barn. later.}
<A>__{joey slowly emerges from the barn with emilie out in front leading him with one hand. in the other hand, she carries a small wooden step ladder.}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{he doesn't think we can do it. but we will show him, won't we?}
<A>__{emilie unfolds the ladder beside joey and shakily starts climbing to the top of it.}
<C>__{emilie }
<P>__{(her voice shaking)}
<D>__{no need to be afraid.}
<P>__{(emilie looking down at}
<D>__{how far off the ground}
<P>__{she is)}
<D>__{you are...very tall.}
<A>__{before she can swing her leg over joey's back }
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{you'll kill yourself.}
<A>__{emilie turns, and there, blocking the hurdle, now standing hands on hips, is grandfather.}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{only if you get in my way to make me fall.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{oh please, come off the ladd }
<A>__{a sound from far down the road. grandfather looks. emilie turns to look too. two trucks led by a german motorcycle are approaching the farm.}
<C>__{grandfather }
<D>__{find somewhere to hide them. and do it quickly!!!}
<A>__{as emilie races off with the horses, grandfather pushes over the jumps and jams the pennant into his pocket. the bikes arrive first, just missing emilie as she leads the horses behind the house. the trucks arrive, pull round one of the soldiers in the front jumps out and opens the back.}
<C>__{german officer}
<D>__{halt! und aussteigen!}
<A>__{the people 20 of them, all seeming to be poor french peasants, mainly women, move out of the truck. as they walk past, they avoid the eye of the grandfather, who approaches the soldiers.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{my name is bonnard this is my land. why are you here?}
<C>__{soldiers}
<D>__{food for the soldiers at the front. everyone must give their share.}
<A>__{and suddenly we see what is going to happen the 20 peasants spread out and move through the field with either bags, or using the aprons they wear picking all the fruits at just the moment all the work has brought forth fruit and the new year's crop is ready. raspberries, black currants, gooseberries. in a few minutes, everything he lives by will be gone. watching from his car and calmly smoking a cigar is brandt, the officer in charge of the unit. cut to the fields the aprons and baskets are getting full. they move through the rows of fruit like a plague of locusts. back to the grandfather and out of the house comes emilie.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{they are taking everything. where are the horses?}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{what horses?}
<A>__{the sound of jars breaking draws grandfather and emilie into the kitchen, where the germans continue to raid their other supplies. one german picks up waterbath canner inspecting it.}
<C>__{german soldier}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{leave it if you don't know what it's for.}
<C>__{german soldier}
<D>__{a pot is a pot. we'll find some use for it. sir, where's the livestock?}
<A>__{brandt sits quietly, casually using his finger to scoop jam from an open jar.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{i make jam. we have no animals.}
<C>__{german soldier}
<D>__{but there's fresh hay in your barn.}
<A>__{emilie enters, overhearing.}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{we use it to replace the mattress stuffings.}
<C>__{german soldier}
<D>__{her grandfather?}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{german soldier}
<D>__{where are her parents?}
<C>__{emilie}
<P>__{(breaking in)}
<D>__{they're dead. they died.}
<A>__{the german nods and is about to take his leave, putting the pot back where he found it, when a clumping noise from somewhere in the house begins.}
<C>__{german soldier}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{the wind. it plays tricks in the attic.}
<A>__{brandt licks his finger and tests:}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{there is no wind.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{an old house creaks.}
<P>__{(to emilie)}
<D>__{go close the shutters.}
<A>__{emilie runs out of the room. the soldier picks up the medicine bottle.}
<C>__{german soldier}
<D>__{she's sickly, no?}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{if you or any of your friends harm her, as old as i am, i will kill you.}
<A>__{the soldier looks shocked and then begins to laugh. he slaps the medicine flask into grandfather's chest.}
<C>__{german soldier}
<D>__{you know, i was going to give you back your pot. but now i'm going to keep it. for soup.}
<A>__{he slings the huge pot he had put back up on his shoulder and leaves the house with the other soldiers.}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{we will be back in the new season.}
<A>__{as the germans leave, we cut to the upstairs bedroom where emilie lies curled up on the bed and there, standing on either side of the bed are the two horses. they look huge in the tiny room.}
