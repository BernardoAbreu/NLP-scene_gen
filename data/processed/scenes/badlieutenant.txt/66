<A>__{lt enters an apartment building, faces a dark and sinister staircase. strange noises come from the apartments above. lt climbs. he hugs the wall, gun at the ready. to lt, it seems some gothic horror may await him at any turn. on one landing, he comes upon a pit bull. a grandmother pulls him back inside an apartment by the leash. on another landing, he sees a junkie shooting up in the shadows. on another landing, a big guy comes barreling out of his apartment and down the stairs, almost bringing lt down with him. on another landing, a guy is taking out very peculiar garbage. it might be body parts to an active imagination. at last, he reaches the door to the apartment for which he's been looking.}
