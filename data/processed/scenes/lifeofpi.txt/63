<L>__{exterior the lifeboat day}
<A>__{pi stands a few feet away from the zebra, using an emergency bucket to bail water out of the bottom of the boat, exhausted from the effort. he pauses to catch his breath, then becomes aware of a slight movement at one side of the tarp. a spotted hyena lurches furtively into view from beneath the tarp, then disappears again. pi freezes, dumbfounded.}
<C>__{pi}
<D>__{hari?}
<A>__{hari, the hyena, with a sloping, bear like forehead and the nervous manner of a beaten dog, reappears. pi instantly dives across the tarp, scrambling for safety on the oar. the hyena staggers and stumbles listlessly. pi turns to face the creature, struggling for calm.}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{looks as though your drugs haven't worn off yet.}
<A>__{the screech of a terrified animal echoes across the water the hyena looks out to port, the hair rising on its back, then staggers beneath the tarp. pi squints into the rising sun. an enormous bundle of bananas bobs into view. the bundle twists and rolls and orange juice, the orangutan tries desperately to stay on top.}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{orange juice!! this way!}
<A>__{within moments, the bundle is within reach of the lifeboat; pi catches the oar handle in the netting that binds the bananas together and pulls it against the side of the boat. o.j. falls onboard in a stuporous fog.}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{welcome to pi's ark!}
<A>__{the netting, wrapped around the handle of the oar, pulls loose from the bananas, which tumble out of reach. as pi reels the netting in, o.j. moans in distress. pi throws a banana to o.j. but she is too sick to react.}
<C>__{pi }
<P>__{(a sudden realization)}
<D>__{where is your boy, orange juice?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i will bet mother and father found him. they'll all be here soon.}
<A>__{o.j. turns to look at pi, a look of inconsolable sadness in her eyes as though she knows better what lies ahead.}
