<A>__{they react similarly to the sound of cobb on the p.a. on cobb and beck corridor beck stops outside his door and sees cobb.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{something wrong, cobb?}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(struggling)}
<D>__{uh..excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{what's wrong with it?}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(thinking fast)}
<D>__{...i'd really have to show it to you.}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{all right...}
<A>__{cobb smiles, he can't believe his luck, then beck holds up the videotape.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{...just let me put this in my safe...}
<A>__{before cobb can react beck opens the door to his quarters and steps inside. beck's quarters we see no sign of dejesus. cobb follows into the room, looking carefully around for sign of dejesus. in the mirror to beck's bathroom, cobb spots dejesus pressing against the wall. cobb suddenly starts to sweat bullets. beck quickly unlocks the safe, opens it, and puts the videotape right next to the bottle of vodka. we see cobb's reaction. beck turns.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{something wrong?}
<A>__{cobb shakes his head weakly and starts to follow beck out, he sneaks a look back at dejesus in the shadows who gives him a thumbs up. mess later five specimen cups filled with vodka. bowman takes hers and looks at it questioningly. cobb watches the door for signs of the officers.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{cute, dejesus...specimen cups?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{aw, loosen up, bowman...}
<P>__{(he looks over and notices willie)}
<D>__{hey, willie, i got one served up for you.}

<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{hey what happens it he goes back and finds the bottle missing?}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{he won't...}
<A>__{he holds up a plastic iv bag filled with clear liquid.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{i poured the vodka in here.}
<A>__{cobb, jones, dejesus, bowman, and sixpack grin and clink glasses, then knock back their vodka. afterwards we get their reactions. jones: looks concerned. bowman: shakes her head, something's wrong. dejesus: can't get the taste off his tongue. cobb: seems totally satisfied. sixpack: who has held the liquid in his mouth savoring it, suddenly spits the vodka out.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{shit! it's water!}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{beck switched it!}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{can you beat that? the sonof abitch doesn't trust us!}
<A>__{willie grins at her co workers and beck's move and jogs out into the corridor. sixpack disgustedly tosses his shot glass away and leaves.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{that little turd. if i ever get the chance i will fix his ass.}
<A>__{the others put down their glasses disappointedly except bowman. she watches sixpack.}
<B>__{dormitory}
<A>__{sixpack's bunk he closes his privacy door and hesitates as if listening for the others, then he removes a silver flask with cyrillic lettering the silver object he palmed in the swamp and smiles as he takes a long pull. suddenly wham! the privacy door to sixpack's bunk is slammed open. startled he turns startled to see bowman.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{didn't i ever tell you vodka was my favorite drink?}
<A>__{she holds out her glass. sixpack looks around the dorm, it's empty, then grins sheepishly and pours her a shot. corridor "b" on willie she is jogging through the corridors. suddenly there is a great groaning noise. willie stops and looks through the steel mesh wall into the machine floor. the dark shapes of the machines move monstrously in the dim light. the groaning ends and she jogs on to the swamp. as she passes the door she notices the light and stops. beck stands with a clipboard by an equipment cabinet filled with the parachute like container transporters we saw outside. he sees her.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{that was a loud one wasn't it?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{after a month of it you'd think i'd be used to it.}
<A>__{she moves into the swamp and goes to the lift lock, stopping under one of the ladders she leaps up and grabs a metal rung above her and begins doing her chin ups as beck watches her lean body easily doing the exercises.}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(watching her)}
<D>__{how's astronaut training?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{why? you going to give me hard time like the others?}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{no. i'm just being friendly.}

<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{good...it's going good.}
<A>__{beck tries to concentrate on his inventory, but continues to watch willie's sexy, athletic body.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{whatever made you want to do a tour down here?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i need electrical field experience on my resume. everything helps...}
<P>__{(she watches him)}
<D>__{why are you here?}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line. sup posed to hone leadership skills or something.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{has it helped?}
<A>__{beck shrugs.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i guess there's not a lot of adventure in the control room.}
<A>__{beck looks up and they lock eyes.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{you think i should hang around more with the crew?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{well, i always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{how did you know they'd get into the vodka?}
<A>__{beck looks up from his clipboard and smiles.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i guess i figured if i was in their shoes that's what i would've done.}
