<A>__{thomas and the three players congratulate each other on the evil and treachery in each other's strategies as they shower down.}
<D>__{player #1 the important thing, tom, is seeing the game for what it is. player #2 a sickening, hopeless, giant sucking hole of depravity.}
<A>__{laughs.}
<L>__{interior locker room dressing area}
<A>__{as thomas combs his hair and slips on his regimental detective's suit 'n tie, the other three put on their black pants, shirts, and stiff white roman collars. they're priests. two of the priests hoist their gym bags and head for the door.}
<D>__{priest #1 see ya guys next tuesday, huh?}
<A>__{thomas is left alone with player (priest) #2, bill.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{so how's work?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{okay. y'now.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{life on the dark side.}
<C>__{daggett}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{can i ask you about something?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{it has to stay between us. i need your word on it.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{as a racquetball player or a priest?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{i will take the priest for the moment.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what's on your mind?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{it's a case. we found this guy. he was... different. but he had on him an old bible.}
<A>__{he pulls the bible out of a cloth sack and hands it to bill.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{it's a vichini.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{worth a little?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{more than a little. they're the best. sixth century. hand illuminated. vichini only did twenty, each pocket size for a king to carry into battle beside his heart. some consider them the finest bibles ever made. i thought they'd all be in museums. what are you doing with it?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{this one's a bit special.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{it's has a bonus chapter to st, john's revelations.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{really? what does it say?}
<C>__{daggett}
<P>__{(reading from slip of paper)}
<D>__{"and as in the first war, the angels so fought over the nature of their god, and there was much vanity and destruction in heaven. for some angels called their lord the son of god, and others called him the begotten father of jesus christ." what do you think?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i've never heard that quote before. theologically, the "first war" obviously refers to the war in heaven where michael the archangel threw out satan and his gang. old time bible stuff. but this implies there was a second war. that's news to me.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{and the rest of it?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{oh, it's a fairly common theological debate. or was. the idea that if christ is god's son, does that make him less than god or are they the same being in different forms. that very argument almost tore the early christian church apart in the 4th century. that was the good old days when people actually worried about theology. anyway, it was settled when the bishops of the world got to together at the council of nicene in 325 and hashed out the various interpretations of scripture into a uniform dogma of belief. the result was the nicene creed, which basically said that christ was in fact the same as god and was owed the same power and respect as the father. that they were the same.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{but it's not exactly the sort of thing angels would fight over.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well, they could just ask god, right?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{do you think it's possible that john might have written that extra chapter?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{who knows? vichini was the greatest biblical scholar of the age, some claimed he made his own translations from the original writings. maybe he did find some unknown writings by john. it's possible i suppose. john always was a little negative about angels. all this actually has something to do with an lapd murder?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{i don't know yet. maybe. probably not.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i hate to break it you, but that particular family spat has been settled for 1,600 years. nobody loses sleep over it anymore. honest.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{what did john have against angels?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{oh, he didn't trust them much. all that running around smiting and killing in the name of the lord. god's wild bunch. he thought it made them fickle and vain. one click above ghosts. satan didn't help the image much either.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{satan?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well, he did start as an angel.}
