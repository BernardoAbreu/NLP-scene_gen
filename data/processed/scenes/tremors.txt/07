<L>__{exterior desert intersection pick up truck day}
<A>__{the pick up turns from a dirt road onto an old paved road.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{what do we have next?}
<L>__{interior pick up moving day}
<A>__{earl consults a crumpled list pulled from inside his hat.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{uh...digging that waterhole for nestor.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{burt and heather's place is closer. let's do their kitchen today. do nestor tomorrow.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{nestor's out of town tomorrow. we don't dig today. we don't get paid today. damn it, valentine, you never plan ahead. you never take the long view. hell, here it is monday and i'm already working on wednesday.}
<P>__{(squints dubiously at his schedule)}
<D>__{it is monday, right?}
<A>__{but val is peering at the desert up ahead. off the road a ways is a small toyota pick up truck and, beside it, a lone figure trying to flag them down.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{who the hell's that? that's not what's his name...the grad student?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{nah, it's september. must be the new one.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{the new one! that's supposed to be a girl!}
<A>__{earl braces himself, knowing what val will do. val swerves the truck wildly off the road, barreling across the desert.}
<C>__{val }
<P>__{(almost praying)}
<D>__{you will have long blonde hair, big green eyes, nice full breasts that stand up and say hello, ass that won't quit. and legs, legs that go all the way up!}
<A>__{earl shakes his head, mildly bemused as they slide to a stop in a cloud of dust.}
