<A>__{the hammering is completed and hands shift the heavy crate onto a dolly. the end credits roll as we see a little old government warehouseman begins pushing the crated ark down as aisle. soon we see that the aisle is formed by huge stacks or crates. they come in many shapes and sizes, but when it comes right down to it, they all look like the one that holds the ark. all have markings like the message we've just seen. pretty soon we're far enough and high enough away from the little old government warehouseman to see that this is one of the biggest rooms in the world. and it is full. crates and crates. all looking alike. all gathering dust. and then we notice that the little old government warehouseman, pushing his new crate ahead of him, has turned into another aisle and disappeared from view.}
