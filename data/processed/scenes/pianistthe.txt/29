<L>__{exterior courtyard and house evening}
<A>__{szpilman approaches the house through a shabby yard.}
<L>__{interior jehuda zyskind's room evening}
<A>__{the noise of a mimeograph machine. a huge, cheerful man with a perpetual cigarette in his mouth.}
<C>__{jehuda}
<D>__{i always say look on the bright side. you're in the small ghetto, intellectuals, professional people, you're better off than us. here, in the large ghetto, it's a cesspool. but you, you're living in monte carlo. you could say you're privileged and that, of course, goes against my principles. nevertheless...}
<A>__{he laughs and coughs, starts looking through papers. his room is piled from floor to ceiling with old papers and stuff. dark, shabby, run down. one of his sons, symche, is operating the mimeograph machine. the other, dolek, is sorting the sheets as they come off the roller. mrs. zyskind, holding a toddler, is cooking at a small stove. jehuda finds what he's been looking for, a newspaper made up of a few sheets.}
<C>__{jehuda}
<D>__{ah, here. today's news from the other side.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{you're amazing, jehuda.}
<C>__{jehuda}
<D>__{no, i'm a socialist. i have brothers everywhere. they bring me news and food. we care about our fellow human beings. workers of the world unite.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{so, what's the news?}
<C>__{jehuda}
<P>__{(scanning the paper)}
<D>__{the germans are advancing on kharkhov.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{i don't know why i come here every evening, it's always such bad news.}
<C>__{jehuda}
<D>__{bad news, you crazy? you have no world view, wladek, that's your trouble. the news couldn't be better. the moment hitler invaded russia, i knew we'd be all right. remember napoleon. same business. the germans will freeze to death, please god.}
<A>__{he beams. szpilman leans over, takes a sheet from the mimeograph.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{jehuda, give me something to do.}
<C>__{jehuda}
<D>__{you're an artist, wladek, you keep people's spirits up. you do enough.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{but i want to help, i want to.}
<C>__{jehuda}
<D>__{you're too well known, wladek. and you know what? you musicians don't make good conspirators. you're too...too musical.}
<A>__{he loves this, laughs, coughs.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{there are notices going up. the city's to be cleansed of undesirables.}
<C>__{jehuda}
<D>__{there are always notices going up.}
<A>__{a distinctive knock on the door. szpilman tenses but jehuda beams. to one of his boys: symche the boy opens the door to admit a short, neat man, majorek.}
<C>__{majorek}
<D>__{hello, symche, dolek, mrs zyskind, jehuda. working hard?}
<A>__{he stops, seeing szpilman.}
<C>__{jehuda}
<D>__{majorek, this is the greatest pianist in poland, maybe in the whole world. wladyslaw szpilman. meet majorek.}
<C>__{majorek}
<P>__{(shakes szpilman's hand)}
<D>__{i know your name. i've never heard you play.}
<C>__{jehuda}
<D>__{majorek used to be in the army. brilliant man. he's got a mind like a searchlight. the only thing i've got against him is he's not a socialist.}
<P>__{(he looks out of the window.)}
<D>__{you'd better go now, wladek. it's nearly curfew.}
<P>__{(he hands over}
<D>__{pamphlets to}
<P>__{majorek.)}
<D>__{you see these, wladek? you know how many copies we print of our newspaper?}
<A>__{szpilman shrugs.}
<C>__{jehuda}
<D>__{five hundred. you know how many people on average read one copy? twenty. that makes ten thousand readers. these will start the uprising. majorek hides them in his underpants. and leaves them in toilets.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{toilets?}
<C>__{majorek}
<D>__{as many toilets as i can find. germans never go into jewish toilets. they're too clean for them.}
<A>__{jehuda loves this too, but his laugh makes him cough appallingly.}
