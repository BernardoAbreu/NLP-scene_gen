<C>__{rob}
<D>__{peter. frampton. that perm! "show me the way"! a phenomenon based on a live album that was actually recorded in a studio! what is happening? i am getting misty, choked up at a song that i had the good sense at twelve to realize was so saccharine and stupid as to be inarticulatable, until michael bolton, that is.}
<T>__{cut back to:}
<L>__{exterior lounge ax club lincoln ave.}
<A>__{he looks around self consciously, and paces a bit, deciding whether or not to stay. he takes a deep breath, and heads in the door.}
<L>__{interior lounge ax night}
<A>__{as rob enters he looks to the stage, where marie lasalle is standing alone with her acoustic guitar, heading toward the song's finish. rob's expression begins to shift from the melancholy to something else altogether. marie is beautiful, and marie has touched his heart. rob navigates toward her though the small crowd as if pulled by something unseen. he addresses us over his shoulder.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{sentimental music makes you nostalgic and hopeful at the same time. marie's the hopeful part. laura's the nostalgia part. these things happen. they happen to men, at any rate. this is why i shouldn't be listening to pop music.}
<A>__{as he gets closer to the stage }
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{rob!}
<A>__{rob looks over to see dick sitting with barry, a few feet away. he shakes it off and sits with them, extending a meaningful hand to barry, who takes it. they turn back to the stage as marie finishes the song.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i always hated this song.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{but now i kind of like it.}
<A>__{dick and barry nod, then keep watching. all three of them are in their own private fantasies with marie.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{she shouldn't done it on "the number four with a smile."}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{isn't her album called "number four with a smile?"}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{that's what i said.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{no, no, no, you said "the number four with a smile," and there's no "the" at the front of the title of the album.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{it's a reference to a chinese meal in toronto and i think that there is a "the." but i could be wrong.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{you can be and are wrong.}
<A>__{they drop it, so that their eyes can drift back to marie.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{i wanna date a musician...}
<C>__{rob}
<P>__{(nods in agreement)}
<D>__{i wanna live with a musician. she'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{...maybe a picture of me in the liner notes...}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{just in the background somewhere.}
<B>__{marie}
<A>__{as the song ends, and she smiles out over the room. the audience applauds.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{thanks, you guys, i know i'm not supposed to like that song, but i do. i'm gonna take a break for a second. anybody wants to buy one of my tapes, they're five bucks up here. one of my other personalities will be selling them.}
<A>__{rob, dick, and barry}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{let's go get one.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{let's not.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{i want a tape.}
<A>__{barry and dick stand and begin to move off...}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i don't need to go up there right now.}
<A>__{...and they're gone. after a beat, rob gets up and follows them.}
<B>__{foot of the stage}
<A>__{dick and barry wait nervously to buy a tape, rob just behind them. marie processes sales with polite monosyllables, until the three get up front.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{enjoying yourselves?}
<A>__{they dart eyes to each other, then nod.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{good. 'cause i'm enjoying myself.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{rob hands her a ten and she roots around in a duffel bag for change...}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{so you live in chicago now?}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{yup. not far from here, actually.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{you like it?}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{it's okay. hey. you guys might be the sort to know. are there any good record stores around here or do i have to go downtown?}
<A>__{barry and dick do not try to control themselves. they point to rob.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{he's got one!}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{on clark street!}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{a couple blocks! about six!}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{we work there!}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{you'd love it!}
<A>__{marie laughs.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{what do you sell?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{a little of anything that matters. rock, soul, r&b, punk rock, hip hop, ska, new wave...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{sounds great.}
<A>__{the line behind them is moving in, and marie smiles at them and turns to someone else. they scurry back toward their table.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{what did you tell her about the shop for?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{i didn't know it was classified information. i mean, i know we don't have any customers, but i thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.}
<A>__{rob looks over barry at marie. she catches his eye as she looks over the room. his eyes shoot to the floor.}
