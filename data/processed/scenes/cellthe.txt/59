<A>__{victim one drops catherine in the center of the room and, job done, crawls away. groggy, feeling sick, catherine sits up. unbeknownst to her, she is sitting at the base of a pedestal with her back to the kind of throne. and someone is there. in the dim pool of light above the pedestal, we see a man rise from the throne. the wall behind him is covered in blood red cloth, and as he descends, we realize it is a cape connected to eight metal rings pierced through the flesh of his back. in a fluid motion, waves of red give way to harshly textured concrete as the man reaches the floor. catherine knows he is there. unable to stop herself, she turns. and sees the terrifying face of stargher. but no the same stargher. this is stargher king.}
