<L>__{exterior essex house day}
<A>__{moments later, oxford and southampton are exiting the elaborate building that serves as essex's london residence.}
<C>__{oxford}
<D>__{essex played rather poorly, didn't he?}
<A>__{southampton just nods, distracted. oxford reaches out to him, and touches his shoulder.}
<C>__{oxford }
<P>__{(warning)}
<D>__{henry... the cecils brook no rivals.}
<A>__{southampton pauses, confused for an instant, then }
<C>__{southampton}
<P>__{(re: his discussion with essex)}
<D>__{you heard?}
<A>__{oxford nods.}
<C>__{southampton }
<D>__{always concerned for me, aren't you edward?}
<A>__{they keep walking towards southampton's men.}
<C>__{southampton }
<D>__{and what would you have me do?}
<C>__{oxford}
<D>__{i would have you deny him.}
<C>__{southampton}
<D>__{the son of the queen?}
<C>__{oxford}
<D>__{that is rumor only, henry }
<A>__{they stop. southampton makes sure that his men are out of earshot.}
<C>__{southampton}
<D>__{rumor? my god, all you have to do is look at essex to see the queen's reflection. everyone thinks he's her son, everyone! and i for one would rather bow to a tudor, bastard though he may be, than a scotsman!}
<C>__{oxford}
<D>__{i desire nothing more than to see the next king be the rightful king. but what essex contemplates will surely lead to civil war.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no. if this is to be done, it must be done carefully, skillfully.}
<C>__{southampton}
<D>__{as i heard it, elizabeth exiled you from her presence for the last twenty years because of your "skill" at court politics.}
<A>__{and then he feels instantly ashamed of having said that.}
<C>__{oxford}
<D>__{i only have your interests in mind, henry. for as you so rightly point out, my interests are already lost.}
<C>__{southampton}
<D>__{i know. forgive me. you know how i feel about you. you have been a great friend to me ever since my father died. i promise you that i will do nothing rash without consulting you first.}
<A>__{oxford nods, still worried, and southampton heads for his horse.}
<C>__{oxford}
<D>__{henry! will you do me one thing more? deliver a gift for me? a rather... elaborate gift?}
