<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(turning back to her)}
<D>__{you know what i think just for the record? i think we're doing something kinda brilliant. all the things that tore us apart aren't issues anymore. i'd say our problems actually went away.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{what..?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{didn't you always say you felt you weren't being heard? wasn't that our big issue both of us always feeling rejected and unappreciated. look at us now. you're so much more together, you're not exhausted all the time, you're not catering every weekend and busy all day with the kids and i'm calmer, less obsessed about work. i'm a partner. i'm there. we grew into the people we wanted each other to be! and i don't know... i appreciate things about you i couldn't even see before.}

<P>__{(getting dressed)}
<D>__{ do you remember never having time for sex? now look at us. we've already done it two times this week and it's only tuesday. i swear to god, if half the couples who got divorced, could get back together 10 years later, their problems would be solved. i think we're on to something.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{not sure i agree and...also, we're not back together.}

<C>__{jane}
<D>__{yeah, i have an ex with benefits...}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{but, girls, what about the fact that i'm now the other woman? i'm the one we hate.}

<D>__{just like to date...}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{actually, i find it really stressful. you know, the last time i was in the dating world was 1978. it's a little more complicated these days. i can't tell you how nice it is to have a conversation with a woman and have the pressure off. not to mention, a home cooked meal that no one else i know could possibly cook.}

<C>__{jane}
<D>__{hate to tell you, big guy, but we already grew old apart.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{what's with the `big guy'? is that because you think i'm fat or is it a term of endearment?}
