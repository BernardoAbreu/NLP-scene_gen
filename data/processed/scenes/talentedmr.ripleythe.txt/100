<L>__{interior ripley's apartment. afternoon.}
<A>__{roverini follows ripley inside, baggio hurries in behind him.}
<C>__{roverini}
<D>__{you and signor ripley went to san remo, is that right?}
<A>__{ripley is appalled. he smiles.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{yes, sure, we did go to san remo. that was months ago.}
<C>__{roverini}
<D>__{november, i thought.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{was it? did you speak to tom?}
<C>__{roverini}
<D>__{november 7th is my information.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i don't remember the exact date.}
<C>__{roverini}
<D>__{and when did you last see signor ripley?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{a few days ago.}
<C>__{roverini}
<D>__{does he stay with you here?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{roverini}
<D>__{no. here is a pattern. two days ago freddie miles is dead he leaves your apartment and is murdered. yesterday a little boat is found in san remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the police it was stolen on november 7th. we look at hotel records and we see oh! dickie greenleaf is staying in san remo and then our boatman remembers two americans taking a boat.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{it's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. there must be fifty hotels in san remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.}
<C>__{roverini}
<D>__{31 people.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{31 people.}
<A>__{baggio appears. speaks to roverini. ripley is getting cranky.}
<C>__{roverini}
<D>__{that is miss sherwood now. marge sherwood.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(appalled, defeated)}
<D>__{let her in, what's the difference? let her in.}
<P>__{(baggio is on his way to the door.)}
<D>__{no, actually, no, i'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.}
<A>__{roverini nods, mutters to baggio, who heads out.}
<C>__{ripley }
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{roverini}
<P>__{(watching him)}
<D>__{may i ask...why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancee?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i think i just said. ripley was handling some business for me, nor does mr ripley want to marry me. nor did he ask me every day if i would marry him. and when.}
<C>__{roverini}
<D>__{do you have a photograph of signor ripley?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.}
<C>__{roverini}
<D>__{now i think i have upset you. my english perhaps is coarse.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{it is a little coarse, yes.}
<C>__{roverini}
<D>__{sorry. no one has seen signor ripley since san }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i have!}
<C>__{roverini}
<D>__{you have, yes.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{no, i have and so has miss sherwood, ask her! and if i could remember which hotel he was staying at the goldoni! tom was staying at the goldoni.}
<C>__{roverini}
<D>__{good. the goldoni. yes you're right. a coincidence.}
<P>__{(he gets up to leave)}
<D>__{i look forward to our next meeting when i will be more careful with my english and persuade you to play me your saxophone. alto.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<C>__{roverini}
<P>__{(suddenly turning)}
<D>__{i have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into mr miles' car. she wants to identify you in a confronto line up.}
<P>__{(ominously)}
<D>__{tomorrow then?}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(thrown, scrabbling)}
<D>__{tomorrow.}
<A>__{ripley lets them out, heaves a heavy sigh, then peeps through the door, looks down to see roverini speaking to marge on the stairs.}
<P>__{roverini (o s)}
<D>__{buongiorno, miss sherwood. he's in but i really don't think he wants to see anyone.}
<A>__{ripley leans against the door, the noose tightening, then suddenly a voice shocks him upright.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{dick? dickie? i know you can hear me. what am i doing, chasing you around...? i was going to say i would count to three and if you didn't open the door, but i won't count any more. on you. i won't count on you any more. whatever it is, whatever you've done or haven't done, you've broken my heart. that's one thing i know you're guilty of, and i don't know why, i don't know why, i just don't know why...}
<A>__{ripley listens, there's a silence, then marge's footsteps as they ring out on the stone stairs. the tapping sound resolves into the tap tap of a manual typewriter.}
