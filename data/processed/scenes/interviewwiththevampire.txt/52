<L>__{exterior waterfront dawn}
<A>__{fingers of light in the sky. louis, pale and shivering, walks splashing through the water. he comes to a huge sewer pipe, crowded with rats. he crawls inside.}
<L>__{exterior waterfront some evenings later}
<A>__{the same sewer pipe. now the bodies of dead rats lie all around. a pair of fine leather boots splash through the water lestat's.}
<L>__{interior sewer pipe evening}
<A>__{louis huddled there, so pale and shivering he seems close to death. lestat comes through.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{all i need to find you louis is follow the corpses of rats.}
<A>__{he bends down to him, surprisingly gently and puts his own coat around him.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{pain is terrible for you. you feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. you don't want it to go on.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{no...}
<A>__{they emerge from the sewer and walk along the waterfront.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{do what it is in your nature to do. and you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{oh god lestat. i felt peace. i felt an end to the craving.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{that and more.}
<A>__{he puts his arm around louis, to stop his shivering.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{evil is a point of view. god kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. for no creatures under god are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{is god merciless? greedy and cruel?}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, i am like a mother tonight. i want a child.}
<A>__{louis is baffled. he follows.}
