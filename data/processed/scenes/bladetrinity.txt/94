<L>__{exterior luna park night day}
<A>__{time lapse. the sun rises over the decrepit amusement park.}
<L>__{interior nightstalkers headquarters armory dawn}
<A>__{sunlight slices down through skylights, bathing blade, king, abigail, and sommerfield in its warmth. zoe has joined them. she's still cautious and shy, but she's also curious.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{why wake up drake now?}
<C>__{abigail}
<D>__{that's what we've been trying to figure out.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{when i was under the fang there used to be talk about some kind of vampire 'final solution'. but i could never figure out why they'd want to destroy their food source. i mean, seems stupid, right? they've always had plans for the human race. seems likely that whatever they're cooking up, drake's return is a part of it.}
<A>__{blade nods, pensive.}
<C>__{king }
<D>__{let's face it, blade we're fighting a losing battle. so we kill a few hundred of them a year. big deal. there are thousands of them out there. maybe tens of th'usands. we need a new tactic.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{sommerfield}
<D>__{a biological weapon.}
<A>__{sommerfield moves to her braille keyboard, types.}
<B>__{on a nearby monitor}
<A>__{we see a real time magnified view of a virus replicating.}
<C>__{sommerfield }
<D>__{for the last year i've been working with synthesized dna in order to create an artificial virus targeted specifically at vampires. we're calling it daystar.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{think about it, blade. we could wipe them all out in a single move.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{so what's been holding you back?}
<C>__{sommerfield}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{we've tried it on a number of captive subjects. we've got the disease vector worked out fine it's easily transmittable. but the lethality in vampires is still spotty.}
<C>__{abigail}
<D>__{bottom line is, we need a better dna sample to work with.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we need dracula's blood.}
<C>__{sommerfield}
<D>__{vampire dna is a hodge podge of different genes, mixed in with all sorts of useless junk dna. because dracula's the progenitor of the vampire race, his dna is still pure. it hasn't been diluted by a hundred generations of selective mutation. it still has all the necessary cellular compounds for the virus to code to. we get his blood, we can boost daystar's viral efficacy to a hundred percent.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{so. you want to join our club? can we sign you up for a nightstalkers secret decoder ring?}
