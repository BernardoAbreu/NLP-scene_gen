<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{why are you asking all of a sudden?}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{no reason. because you're leaving, i guess. i don't think you were there, were you?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{i mean it as a compliment. you've got such great taste, i don't know. most of the thugs at princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. used to say, the cream of america: rich and thick. freddie's the perfect example.}

<D>__{i've gotten to like it. i've gotten to like everything about the way you live. it's one big love affair. if you knew my life back home in new york...}
<A>__{dickie's distracted by the drummer who's playing an extrovert solo, doesn't hear the confession of love.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{i'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{so cool.}
<A>__{he mimes a high hat and snare. ripley can't quite credit this it's superficiality.}
