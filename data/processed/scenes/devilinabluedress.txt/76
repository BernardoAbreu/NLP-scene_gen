<A>__{it's a horseshoe of tiny apartments with over a dozen little porches and doorways staggered in a semi circle around a small yard that has a half dozen stunted magnolia trees growing in brick pots. easy and mouse step into the courtyard, passing elderly tenants sitting inside screened doors. jimmy lunceford's "i'm walking through heaven with you" floats out into the yard. they arrive at the closed door of number eight. easy knocks and then knocks again, hard. something crashes on the inside and heavy footsteps pound to the door.}
