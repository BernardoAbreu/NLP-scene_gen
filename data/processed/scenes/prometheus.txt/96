<A>__{kamarov carries a stepladder into a utilitarian steel compartment. drops the ladder under an air vent and steps up. he pulls a powered wrench from his belt. with the wrench cocked like a hammer, he eases up and peers cautiously through the vent with a flashlight. nothing to see. he snorts. removes the vent cover. feels around inside. he gasps in shock. pulls out an atmosphere sensor that's been bitten in half. he takes his comm handset off his belt.}

<A>__{he hangs the handset on his belt. takes one last look into the vent. squints curiously. reaches deep inside. a hiss inside the vent. kamarov whips his flashlight up, peering inside. snatches his arm back but something snatches him faster. an unseen force drags kamarov's right arm into the vent with hideous strength. he cries out in pain. he drops his light. tries to reach his pistol with his left hand. it's on his right hip. he can't reach across. he braces his head against the vent's edge. clenches his teeth and strains. a horrific yank drags his head and arm together into the vent. they barely fit: he loses some skin on the way in. his feet come off the stepladder. he struggles on tip toe. horrific force collapses kamarov's shoulder. bones crack. the thing in the vent drags him through that hole he doesn't fit through. by the time his ribs are in he stops screaming. his body disappears into the hole. hips, legs, boots.}
