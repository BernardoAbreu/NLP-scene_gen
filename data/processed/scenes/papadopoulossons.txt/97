<L>__{exterior south bank. day 10.}
<A>__{sophie and harry are strolling along london's south bank.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{so it's 30% on materials. the fish, the potatoes, the packaging etc. would you include energy? light, heat?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah. but not rent because we already own the building.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{okay. and 30% on labour?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{so it's 30 30 30. classic restaurant model.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{what are your weaknesses?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{the price of fish can vary. dramatically.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{can you vary the menu?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you don't want to complicate it.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{it doesn't have to be complicated harry. (beat) what are your fears?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{my fears? oh. just that it just won't work out. that fish and chips has maybe had its day.}
<C>__{sophie}
<P>__{no. hang on a second. (they stop)}
<D>__{fish and chips is a british classic. it's much more than just a quick meaningless experience. it's something to be savoured. just think of the soft, white, cod flakes, gently falling away as your fork pierces the hard, crunchy shell of the golden batter. the rich smells of a fryer's delight. the tangy smack of salt and vinegar on your lips. hell yeah. i'd pay for that.}
<C>__{sophie }
<P>__{(harry and sophie exchange glances.}
<D>__{they hold a look) we should talk about... we should talk about accounting packages.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yes. we should}
<A>__{we see harry and sophie walk down south bank.}
