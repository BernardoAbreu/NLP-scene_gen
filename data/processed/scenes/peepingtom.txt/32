<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(in a whisper)}
<D>__{again?}
<A>__{mark looks at her in silence. the boy moves restlessly, then turns over onto his face, pulling the bedclothes round him. his right hand is limp on the pillow. the light shines for a moment on this hand, then goes out. helen half turns towards mark.}

<C>__{helen}
<D>__{mark, whatever is that?}
<A>__{her voice trails away. she stares repelled and fascinated at the screen. we see mark reach for his cine camera. over helen's shoulder we see the lizard reach the counterpane. it stretches itself out on the floral design its body is pointed towards the child's hand. we hear a click and suddenly a spotlight falls onto helen's face. overlaid is the gentle purring of mark's cine camera. she wheels towards him blotting out the small screen.}

<C>__{man's deep voice }
<D>__{that'll do mark... dry your eyes and stop being silly.}
<A>__{small mark reaches for the handkerchief and wipes his eyes... his hands are trembling. the small screen trembles with them into a clumsy dissolve. helen turns to mark.}

<D>__{better go...}
<A>__{from helen's pov we see the screen. small mark is wearing a dark suit and a black tie. he is standing at the foot of a four poster bed, staring at something in horror and disbelief... his hands clasp the bedrail tightly. slowly very slowly he walks towards the head of the bed, staring. his lips begin to quiver. he bends forward over the bed. we can see the back of his bowed head.}

<C>__{mark}
<D>__{she filmed... what comes now.}
<A>__{close shot of helen watching intently. it's out of focus! from helen's pov we see a tall man in a black coat walking away from camera. he hurries towards small mark who watches him anxiously.}

<D>__{is that your father?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{the morning that he left for his honeymoon.}

<C>__{mark}
<D>__{can't you guess?}
<A>__{the small screen comes back into focus and suddenly our camera rushes towards it. we see a close shot of a close shot and at the moment we see it, mark's voice is overlaid... a whisper which echoes round the room.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{a camera...}
<A>__{we are looking at a close shot of a camera in a small boy's hands. there is a single shrill chord of music on the sound track. close shot of the shelf which encircles mark's room. we are looking at the very same camera which the small boy is holding. close shot of the camera in small mark's hands. his father's finger points lo the view finder. small mark stares into it. small mark begins to smile. close shot of mark watching himself being born. close shot of helen watching mark.}
