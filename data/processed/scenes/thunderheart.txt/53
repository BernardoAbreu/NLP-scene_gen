<A>__{ray steps out of the car into the rain and closes the door. he stares at the burial grounds. then slowly, he starts toward them as if magnetically drawn. heartbeat drum. a shroud of mist lays over the cemetery, growing thicker as the rain falls harder. drum beats deeper. ray is walking toward the memorial, getting drenched. then he hears something strange. hoofbeats. ray's pov: coming down the dirt road, toward him, a horseman drives his mount at a fast trot. the rider is only a vague image in the mist, his face hidden. as he rides closer, we can make out a shotgun in his hand. and he throws it up, takes aim. reverse ray paralyzed for a moment. and then going for his gun. but it's not there. he's left it in the car. he breaks into a run. but there's a shorter distance now between the horseman and the car and ray has no choice but to turn and flee. his boots slap wet pavement, and his breath draws heavy and desperate as he bounds off the road and races down a grassy slope, looking over his shoulder, panicking. his legs and arms churning, his face contorted. and then someone passes him out, running just as hard. an indian woman in 1890 winter rags, clutching a baby to her breast and crying. screaming. ray looks at her, incredulous as he runs. but he keeps running. the rider is right behind him. he fires. the gunshot cracks the sky like thunder. boooom!}
