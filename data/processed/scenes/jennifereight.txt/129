<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i realized the flashlight was at the bottom of the stairs st anne did you check your weapon?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{maybe. it would have been instinctive. all i know was i was in possession of it .. st anne you didn't check it?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{not that i specifically remember. st anne why not?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i don't know. i wasn't think ing about it .. i was dazed .. st anne you were woozy? confused?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i was unconscious 10 seconds ago. st anne i understand. then?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{then i picked up the flashlight, tried to get ross on the radio .. nothing. static. i got blood on my hand, realized my eye was cut. st anne could you see out of it?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{yeah, i could see. then i ran. climbed out of the window, ran down the fire escape, and right at the bottom, i found ross .. st anne were you breathless?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{sure i was breathless ... st anne when did you realize you were no longer in possession of the .25?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{not until i was in the hospital. st anne you figure you lost it in the hospital? or on the way there?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{no, i thought it must have fallen down the stairwell. st anne [berlin] like the flashlight? [yeah] had you been drinking that night?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{it was christmas eve. st anne that wasn't my question?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{yes. st anne [berlin] how about ross? [sure] were you drinking in the car? [?] there was a bottle in the car?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i think ross had a mouthful? st anne but not you?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i may have had a nip? st anne to keep out the cold? .. very cold that night, very windy, wasn't it?}
<A>__{st anne motors off & refers to notes without looking at berlin.}
<D>__{which hand was the flashlight in?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{my left hand. st anne and the walther was in your right?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{the beretta was in my right hand .. st anne you said you didn't check it? so how d'you know which gun you're holding?}
<A>__{the chair moves back in and its pilot has an icicle up his ass.}
<D>__{you said you figured it had fallen down the stairs with the flashlight? you said you were confused? you pick up the flashlight in confusion, how d'you know you didn't pick up the 25?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{let's not start playing games, mr st anne. st anne games?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i told you, i'd lost the walther .. st anne you told me you didn't know you'd lost it until you were in the hos pital? so, if you didn't know till then, it coulda been either weapon?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{the gun in my hand was a beretta. and for the record, i want that note corrected. now, please, sir.}
<A>__{the dead smile and rubber in action. st anne changes his notes.}
<D>__{st anne ok. i'm corrected. i'm sorry, i made a mistake.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{with respect, sir, you didn't make a mistake. i know who you are, and you're far too experienced for mis takes. now if you have doubts over the content, or veracity of my rep ort, i wanna be made aware of them? st anne sure.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i wanna be made aware of them now. st anne do you want a lawyer, sergeant?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{there you go again? "do i want a lawyer, sergeant?" it's a game question. what do i want a law yer for? i got nothing to hide .. st anne you don't?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{you know i don't. so let's quit the bullshit and get down to it. what's your "angle," mr st anne?}
<A>__{for the first time st anne moves his chair into berlin's space.}
<D>__{st anne where's the little gun, sergeant?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i've no idea. st anne you don't?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{if it isn't in the institute, the man who shot ross took it. st anne the man who shot ross, used it ..}
<A>__{implications are ganging up quicker than berlin can focus them.}
<D>__{and you don't know where that little twenty five calibre walther's gone?}
<A>__{berlin confirms it. looking very concerned. the wheels retreat. st anne shakes out a cigarette and takes his time with matches.}
<D>__{ok. sergeant, here it is. i intend to produce evidence, that will prove you shot frederick ross with malice afore thought. my angle therefore, is to pre pare a case on behalf of your chief, to prosecute you for first degree murder.}
