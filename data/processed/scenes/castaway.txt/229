<A>__{the ocean again, low. the raft floats into frame. a trace of a breeze flaps the signal kite, which barely stays aloft, its rope frayed and tattered. the still is set up in the middle, plastic with a rock weighting down the center. chuck is gaunt, his clothes rotted. he lies looking over the side of the raft, spear in one hand, staring intently at the water. dorados swim like specters, flashing and darting. chuck stabs with his spear. stabs again.}

<A>__{exhausted, he sinks back to the raft. two dorados leap into the air ahead of him. chuck tries to stare again into the water. he spots another fish, a flash of silver under the surface. chuck struggles to his feet, raises his spear. splat! something strikes him in the chest, almost knocking him into the water. on the raft we see flashes of silver and green and blue. a flying fish. chuck dives at it, catches it, loses it.}
