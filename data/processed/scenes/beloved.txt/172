<C>__{sethe }
<D>__{i think it was stamp paid who started it. he walked six miles to the riverbank, slid into a ravine, reached through blood drawing thorns, suffered mosquitoes, wasps and the meanest lady spiders in the state just to bring us those berries.}
<A>__{he places the baskets on the porch in front of baby suggs, sethe who is holding denver..and the little girl (beloved).}
<C>__{baby suggs}
