<L>__{interior office}
<A>__{dark and empty. norville is peeling off his coat as he staggers over to the closet. we can hear distant revelry and the strains of "auld lang syne." norville has pulled his old mailroom apron from the closet and is putting it on: hudsucker mail room the future is now. norville looks at the door. through the glass we see the tail of the last r of "mussburger" being painted into place. norville throws open the window.}
<B>__{wind whistles.}
<A>__{he climbs out.}
<B>__{ledge}
<A>__{norville, back against the wall, looks cautiously down. we hear distant chanting:}
<C>__{voices }
<D>__{ten... nine... eight... seven...}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{a sickening drop. receding snowflakes. on the street far, far below, a lone car's headlights cut through the falling snow.}
<C>__{voices }
<D>__{six... five... four...}
<B>__{wider on norville}
<A>__{we are floating in; it is the shot with which the movie began. the sweep second hand of the hudsucker clock is approaching the 12 of midnight, the new year. in sync with the clock the chanting continues:}
<C>__{voices }
<D>__{three... two...}
<A>__{we have come in close on norville. a lone tear runs down his cheek.}
<C>__{voices }
<D>__{...one...}
<A>__{bong! the toll is right at norville's ear. startled, he reaches up to press hands against his ears. distantly:}
<C>__{voices }
<D>__{happy new year!}
<A>__{bong!! he can't stand it. whimpering, hands to his ears, he edges his way back toward the window.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{the open window at a steep angle. someone inside slides it shut.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{norville waves.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{no }
<A>__{bong!! his gesticulation and a shuffle step upset his balance he trips falls catches the ledge }
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{ no, please!}
<A>__{he is hanging onto the icy ledge by his fingertips. his feet dangle away. snow falls.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{looking steeply up.}
<B>__{clock}
<A>__{its second hand is making its descent.}
<B>__{norville}
<A>__{falling.}
<B>__{mussburger}
<A>__{laughing.}
<B>__{second hand}
<A>__{descending.}
<B>__{norville}
<A>__{falling, turning lazily in the air and suddenly, with a great moaning sound he stops, suspended in mid air, head down, feet in the air. it is much like the freeze frame on waring hudsucker that the title of the film was supered over. he waves his arms, to no effect, looks around.}
<B>__{people in street}
<A>__{frozen in attitudes of laughter, celebration. snow sifts silently down around their motionless bodies.}
<B>__{mussburger}
<A>__{in his office, frozen with an idiotic laugh pasted to his face.}
<B>__{his perpetual motion balls}
<A>__{frozen, one ball swung out but suspended, hanging at the apex of its arc. outside the great arched window, snow falls.}
<B>__{norville}
<A>__{he alone can move, but doesn't fall. he looks awkwardly about, his body in a dive bomber attitude, canted steeply down.}
