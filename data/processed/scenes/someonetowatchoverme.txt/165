<L>__{interior mike's kitchen night morning}
<A>__{mike hurries in. the room is bright. scotty and another cop, brooklyn from the 117th, look up from the kitchen table, nursing cups of coffee. brooklyn is on duty; scotty has come over on his own. tommy has long since been ushered back to bed. ellie making coffee at the stove, turns as mike enters. she is okay, returning mike's stare with embarrassment.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{calm down, everything is okay. ellie reported a prowler. probably one of those peepers who've been making this neighborhood such a pleasure...}
<A>__{scotty collects his gun from the table, rising.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{we all look like hell.}
<C>__{brooklyn}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{well, there you are...}
<P>__{(to ellie, unconcerned)}
<D>__{i will come 'round in the car from time to time so you can get some sleep. just keep the shades pulled.}

<C>__{brooklyn}
<D>__{thanks for the coffee.}
<C>__{ellie}
<P>__{(to both)}
<D>__{thanks. you're terrific.}
<A>__{scotty waves her off with a goodbye, exiting after brooklyn. ellie turns back to mike.}
<C>__{ellie}
<P>__{(sheepishly)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i know i heard noises... the detective's wife...}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(tensely)}
<D>__{i want you and tommy to stay with my mother.}
<A>__{she shakes her head, amused.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{don't be ridiculous... that's all i need, rubbing up against your mother and grandmother every day... i can take care of myself...}
<P>__{(gently, to him)}
<D>__{c'mon, let's go to bed... we all need some sleep...}
