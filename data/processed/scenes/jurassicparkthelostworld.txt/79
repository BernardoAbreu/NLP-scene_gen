<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{wait there. i will come up in a minute. don't move, understand?}
<C>__{kelly }
<D>__{i understand.}
<A>__{malcolm slump against the wall of the trailer. sarah and nick sit on the floor leaning against the opposite wall, completely drained. sarah pulls out her pocket recorder and speaks shakily into it.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{note to dr. juttson tyrannosaurus rex does nurture its young.}
<A>__{they laugh weakly.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{there's, uh there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone. you stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on. whether or not you feel lucky. one "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{well? do we go on?}
<A>__{immediately:}
<C>__{sarah}

<D>__{no.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no way.}

<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{all right. i'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. i feel vindicated. john hammond will too.}
<P>__{(to sarah)}
<D>__{do you have enough to publish?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{they will come after me. but i can collect some stool samples, for dna with that, nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back. i will call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now. this expedition is over.}
<A>__{he goes to the desk and picks up the heavy gray satellite phone that's resting in a battery pack. the front panel lights up, a brilliant green. but from the wall speaker, the radio crackles and eddie's voice breaks through, soft and empty.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{oh, god. i am so sorry.}
<A>__{malcolm and sarah look at the speaker box.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what the hell is he sorry f }
<A>__{a low rattle sneaks into the trailer. malcolm, sarah, and nick takes a step forward from the walls, looking around. the rattle gets louder, the trailer shakes and vibrates, everything in it starts to bang against the walls and something huge smashes into the side of the trailer. they're all thrown against the far wall, there is an earsplitting crack of electricity, the entire trailer rocks and sparks a brilliant blue, and then everything goes black. the satellite phone flies out of malcolm's hands and smacks against the wall. it lands on the floor, its number pad still glowing green. nick crawls over and looks out one of the windows. outside, the flank of one of the tyrannosaurs wipes past the window, revealing the second tyrannosaur, charging straight at the trailer!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{hang on to something!}
<A>__{they hurl themselves at the nearest solid object and hang on for dear life. the charging rex slam into the side of the trailer, which rocks up on one side, bangs back down, and is quickly rammed again by the furious animal. this time the entire trailer rolls over, completely upside down. sarah, nick, and malcolm let go of their precarious handholds and drop onto the ceiling. the tables, chairs, lab equipment, everything that's bolted down clings to the floor above them; everything that isn't rains down on them. but the rexes aren't done. the trailer jolts into motion, sliding forwards. seen from outside, the upside down trailer, which is the rear of the two trailers, slides along the muddy ground, pushing up earth in front of it. in the trailer,}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{they're pushing us!}
<A>__{malcolm, frantic, crawls up to a window to get a look outside. he looks down and sees a t rex footprint in the earth outside as they move past it. he cranks his head to get a look at the direction in which they are being pushed. his eyes widen at something he sees outside the window.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{oh, god.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{they're pushing us over the cliff.}
<A>__{sure enough, out the back window, we see a few more feet of muddy earth, and then nothing but inky black. the three of them look at each other for a moment and then crawl like hell toward the other end of the trailer. the opposite end reaches the edge of the cliff and starts up to tip ever so slightly downward. they reach the accordion like connector and malcolm crawls into it. through the windshield of the front trailer, which is right side up, malcolm can see the two rexes hard at it, pushing the front end of the trailer. in the rear trailer, nick has a pretty good grip at the top of the trailer, but sarah can only cling to an air vent in the ceiling as stuff starts to roll and tumble past her, headed downhill. the angle increases, the trailer dips, and now stuff starts to freefall, right past her, some smashing her in the head. malcolm, still in the connecting tube, grabs hold. sarah, starting to be pulled downward, paws at the refrigerator, getting a g rip on the handle. the door, held by a safety latch, doesn't open. below sarah, debris falls to the rear window of the trailer. through the cracking glass, we can see the surf, crashing five hundred feet below. the refrigerator bolts suddenly crunch free of the wall. the box strains on its power cord. still clinging to the handle, sarah swings wildly as it starts to come loose, swaying above her. the safety latch on the door gives, it swings open, and a shower of food bangs off of her as gravity empties the contents. sarah loses her grip and plummets through the now vertical trailer. she screams, covers her head, and smashes into the rear window. the glass spiderwebs, but does not break. five hundred feet below, an enormous wave pounds the rocky shore. above, sarah is a tiny figure, sprawled out on the glass, held invisibly by the breaking window. in the trailer, nick shouts to her.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{sarah! don't move!}
<A>__{sarah, stunned by the fall, blinks a few times, regaining her senses. she looks down, at the crashing surf so far below. for a person with a fear of heights, this is a real drag. as she stares, the rocks seem to move even farther away from her. she blanches; the world spins around her.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{oh... god ... please...}
<A>__{her breath fogs the cracked glass. slowly, she tries to get up, caaaaaarefully pulling herself up to her hands and knees. but as she puts pressures on her hands, the glass cracks even more, tiny spiderwebs shooting out around her fingers. the whole glass panel sags, bowing out around the bottom of the trailer. up above her, malcolm looks down and sees the satellite phone precariously balanced on one leg of the kitchen table, its number pad still glowing green. nick is closest to it.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{nick! grab the phone!}
<B>__{sarah}
<A>__{looks to her right, at a metal grating that runs along the wall of the trailer. she shifts her weight, leaning on one hand to reach for the grating with the other.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{reaches for the satellite phone, its antenna just six inches from his outstretched fingers.}
<B>__{sarah}
<A>__{leans toward the metal grating, all hairline cracks shoot out around her pivot hand, shaking through the glass. the splintered glass spread like a disease, it reaches the edge of the frame and her hand cracks right through the glass. she gasps and pulls her hand out, but now she knees smash through the glass.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{has two fingers on the phone, but suddenly the whole trailer shudders and the heavy phone tips off the table leg and falls.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{sarah look out!}
<B>__{sarah}
<A>__{lunges for the metal grating and clings to it just as the heavy phone whizzes past her head and smashes into the glass, opening up a huge hole in the center of the back window. underneath the trailer, glass, food, lab equipment, and the precious satellite phone fall out the broken window and smash on the rocks far below. in the cleaning, the trailers are split, like an l, the rear trailer hanging straight down, the forward one resting on the edge of the cliff. satisfied with their work, the t rexes turn and lumber back into the jungle. in the trailer, sarah climbs carefully up the metal grating. above her, nick lowers himself as far as he can, reaching for her. on the cliffside, we realize the hanging trailer halted its descent because one corner of it is wedged in the branches of a tree that grows out from the muddy cliff. but now those branches splinter. in the trailer, malcolm sees the bellows, the connector between the trailers, stretch as the lower trailer jerks and dips lower. below him, sarah mountain climbs through the trailer's kitchen, inadvertently kicking the faucet on as she struggles for purchase. outside, the tree branch snaps and the trailer jerks, stretching down again. the bellows expands to its full length, stretching like a slinky. inside, nick knows he has to hurry. he climbs down, bouncing off the built in furniture, moving ever closer to sarah. but sarah slips and loses her grip, dropping a few feet. she gabs hold of the sink, the flowing water spraying her face.}
