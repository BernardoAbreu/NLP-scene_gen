<L>__{interior lapp farmhouse}
<A>__{where the amish have gathered for the traditional post funeral, midday meals. long tables are laden with customary amishfare... crocks of soup, hams, fowl, fried boiled eggs and pickled beets, preserves and an infinite variety of pies and pastries.}
<B>__{rachel}
<A>__{where she sits among women, accepting their condolences.}
<B>__{daniel hochstetler}
<A>__{a brawny armed, ruggedly handsome, raffish looking amishman. there is something atypical about his face a slightly sardonic set of mouth, a bold eye, a prominent set of jaw. not exactly what old jacob ammann had in mind, maybe, but a well set up man nonetheless, and at ease among men. he's among a group of men including old stoltzfus, the local healer, fisher, bieiler and bieiler's stout young son, tom.}
<C>__{stoltzfus}
<D>__{lapp was a good farmer. none better.}
<C>__{beiler}
<D>__{but not the man to buy a horse for you.}
<P>__{(and)}
<D>__{hochstetler, wasn't it your father sold him that horse with a ruptured testicle?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{told him it was a bee sting made him limp that way.}
<C>__{hochstetler}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{that horse had one good ball. that's all it takes.}
<A>__{the others chuckle. but hochstetler's attention is still on rachel.}
<B>__{rachel}
<A>__{as hochstetler looms on the horizon, plants himself like a tree in front of her. at ease as he was with the men, he's a bit awkward at this. all the women, very much aware of hochstetler's availability, tune in as rachel looks up.}
<C>__{hochstetler}
<D>__{i was sorry to hear about jacob. let us hope he walks close with god.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i'm sure he does, daniel.}
<A>__{fields, lapp farm day it is some time after the funeral and the lapp family is hard at work breaking ground for the spring ploughing. the death of jacob has increased the work load on all three samuel maneuvers a four mule team while rachel and old eli work nearby, further breaking up the earth. rachel looks up from the back breaking labor as several figures approach it's daniel hochstetler and two of his brothers. without a word they fall in beside eli and rachel and take up various tasks associated with the work in hand. daniel works close beside rachel.}
