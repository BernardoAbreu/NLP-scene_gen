<L>__{exterior woods clearing day}
<A>__{only a few yards from the picnic area, the woods take over completely.}
<B>__{panning with sarah}
<A>__{as she runs down the path. reese tackles her from behind and they fall together in the long spring grass. she struggles violently to get away.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{let...go...bastard...}
<A>__{she gets one arm free and whacks him hard in the face. reese reacts instinctively, leaping back in a defensive crouch. sarah freezes when she sees the .357 in his hand.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(continuing,}
<D>__{scared, but}
<P>__{angry)}
<D>__{oh, that's real smart. go on, shoot me. that's brilliant.}
<A>__{reese is trembling as he lowers the gun. sarah too is shaking with emotion. tears roll down her cheeks and her voice cracks.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{jesus christ, reese. can't you see i'm scared?}
<A>__{he straightens up and his arms go limp at his sides. he turns away.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i can't spend my life waiting for that thing to catch up with me...always looking over my shoulder, wondering if i left some tiny clue behind...}
<A>__{reese doesn't respond. the gun slips from his fingers. his will seems to drain from him and he sags to his knees. the moment stretches. there is only the sunlight moving in shafts through the leaves, the sound of a small stream nearby, birds chirping.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{reese?}
<A>__{she crawls over to him. c.u. reese in profile, with sarah in b.g. his eyes are closed. a tear meanders down his cheek.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(continuing, quietly)}
<D>__{kyle?}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{i'm wrong here. i wasn't meant to see this...}
<A>__{he gestures at their surroundings.}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it's...like some dream. this...this...}
<A>__{he touches the grass, the trunk of a tree.}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...and you...all so...beauti ful. it hurts, sarah. more than death.}
<A>__{he looks are her beseechingly.}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{don't you understand...it's all gone!}
<A>__{sarah puts her arm around him. she sniffs and wipes at her nose with the back of her hand.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{we can change it, kyle. we have to try.}
<A>__{she takes his shoulder in her hands.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{there's no fate but what we make for ourselves. right? come on. let's go, kiddo. whaddya say?}
<A>__{he picks up her sign and they look at each other for a second, then get up.}
