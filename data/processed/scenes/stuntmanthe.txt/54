<A>__{as it touches the ground and its doors fly open. out step the crewmen and eli cross. the assistant director rushes up and shouts over the hissing blades of the idling chopper.}

<D>__{what happened on the bridge?!}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(deeply upset)}
<D>__{all the divers found in the car was the goddamn camera.}
<C>__{a.d.}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{and burt?}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(anguished)}
<D>__{no burt! all gone...caught in the current probably and...they're diving downstream and searching the riverbanks, but...don't say anything to the crew yet...}
<C>__{a.d.}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{jesus christ.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{yeah, jesus christ.}
<C>__{a.d.}
<D>__{what do you want to do?}
<C>__{eli}

<P>__{(desperately)}
<D>__{...what the hell could have happened?}
<A>__{their words are lost in the sound of the rotor as the chopper slowly rises. the sudden wind from its blades blows some screening off a pile of equipment. it falls on the little old lady who has been approaching eli and topples her into the surf. she is trapped in a tangle of ancient skirts and petticoats. before she can regain her balance, a wave tumbles her further into the sea.}
