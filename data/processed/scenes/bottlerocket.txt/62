<L>__{interior mexican bar. night}
<A>__{anthony, dignan, and inez are drinking beers with limes and salt. the mood is good and they're getting drunk. anthony and inez dance. then dignan and inez. mexican style, stomping their feet and clapping. there's a scruffy dog in the bar and he barks at the dancers. anthony kisses inez and they whisper to each other. dignan orders another beer and moves over to the pool table. a skinny mexican man puts his arm around dignan's shoulder. he's drunk and slurring his words. so's dignan.}
