<L>__{interior town hall. day continuous time.}
<A>__{at the end of the hall is jack. to one side of him is his christmas treasure trunk filled to the brim with dolls and toys and decorations. on the other side, the mayor sits at a table. before him is an open scroll a long list. with his raven feather pen, the mayor enthusiastically marks off items and occasionally scribbles notes: forging ahead with the making of christmas, he and jack are giving out assignments to the citizens of halloweenland. at the moment, jack discusses dollmaking with a couple of large vampires... one of the vampires cradles an example of a babydoll in the palm of his hand. as he rocks it, its eyes close if it's lying down, but open when it's brought upright. the doll also cries bleating sadly. the vampires make a face at one another.}

<D>__{what kind of noise is that for a baby to make?}
