<L>__{interior pentagon situation room night u.s.n. commander charles}
<A>__{anderson, 35, just the hardest looking man you've ever seen, stands before the group. anderson is a navy s.e.a.l., an incursion team leader. before anderson are aerial recon photos of alcatraz.}
<C>__{commander anderson}
<D>__{a precision night drop is out due to the full moon. likewise on a frontal, seaside attack: at the first shot, hummel might launch. my second in command is working on an attack from within the prison.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the idea is to penetrate the tunnels under the prison, undetected, emerge in its center, and jump the marines from behind take their rocket positions without a shot fired. but i need better intelligence.}
<C>__{general kramer}
<D>__{you've studied the architectural plans.}
<C>__{commander anderson}
<D>__{they're useless. alcatraz was originally a civil war fort. it's been ripped up and rebuilt for years. under there is a maze of shit, excuse my language.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what i need is personal, firsthand intelligence on the island's tunnels.}
<A>__{camera focuses on f.b.i. director womack, who gives a very significant look to c.i.a. director amway.}
<C>__{general kramer}
<D>__{the former warden?}
<C>__{agent wood}
<D>__{died in 1979. the guards we contacted are useless. there was a janitor, "alcatraz al". he worked there for twenty years, but he died in 1983.}
<C>__{general peterson}
<D>__{didn't three guys escape? i thought i saw a movie about it.}
<C>__{agent wood}
<D>__{it's a hollywood myth. no one's escaped alcatraz and lived.}
<A>__{f.b.i. director trades a very significant look with c.i.a. director amway. amway clears his throat. he is older, very old school. everyone turns to him.}
<C>__{c.i.a. directory amway}
<D>__{there is someone who can help us.}
<C>__{f.b.i. director womack}
<D>__{the c.i.a. director and i have something to discuss in private.}
<A>__{womack and amway rise and exit together. everyone else sits there, confused.}
