<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{interior basement of old mill night}
<A>__{waking is slow. samantha opens her eyes. blinks. hazy, out of focus. tries to rub her eyes, can't. hands. something's wrong, what the hell'd she do with her hands...? ah. they're stretched over her head. bound with cord. suddenly she's very awake.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{the basement of the old converted mill. a drafty, windswept place full of old, broken timbers. a river runs through it. a stream, at any rate. the waters are still and frozen now. above the stream a great wooden wheel. smaller corollary of the wheel outside. mounted on the same axis. samantha is tied to that wheel. lashed to its side, affixed to it like a goddess to a greek sailing ship. now the bad news, the ice has been chopped away so the wheel can turn... and it will plunge samantha under the freezing water. beneath the ice. bound hand and foot. strapped to the wheel, wearing only a nightgown, she is utterly helpless. the man known as daedalus (aka luke) stands before her, giving instructions to the ubiquitous timothy. he looks up at samantha. seeing her eyelids flutter, he tosses her a cherry wave. gone is the gee whiz country boy schtick; in its place, a frightening arrogance. he tosses her his cheeriest wave:}
<C>__{daedalus}
<D>__{well, good afternoon. if it isn't the forgetful spy. how you feeling?}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{not so fresh.}
<A>__{samantha struggles against her bonds. no dice. subsides. takes a look around at her predicament. timothy stands at the edge of the ice. watching her intently. smiles thinly:}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{you... you're... the man from the bar...?}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{look at her. she's not faking it, she doesn't know me from adam.}
<A>__{daedalus shakes his head, frowning:}
<C>__{daedalus}
<D>__{it's not that i don't trust my compatriot, colonel baltimore. in fact, i had every confidence that your amnesia was genuine until you showed up here. you follow?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{meanwhile, i just got around to reading the papers, there's the small matter of an incident upstate. long range rifle shot, blew a man out of his socks.}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{you can see where i'm coming from. i'm trying to pull of the biggest job of my career. i have to know. how much you really remember... and who you've told.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{i didn't tell a soul, i swear.}
<C>__{daedalus}
<D>__{we'll soon know.}
<A>__{he crosses toward a large red button. set into a wooden beam. samantha thrashes at the bindings. looks down at the water where it intercepts the mammoth wheel. fighting panic:}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{is... is this a torture thing...?}
<C>__{daedalus}
<D>__{torture, yes. the torturing of beautiful women, albeit politically incorrect, is an addiction with me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{a woman never looks quite so beautiful as when her face is distended in pain. witness the beauty of childbirth.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{please, i'm getting all misty. look, untie me, i will make any face you want.}
<C>__{daedalus}
<D>__{let's not, and say we did. do you smoke?}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{smoke...? um, no. not... not really.}
<C>__{daedalus}
<D>__{good. you'll last longer. now hush yourself, and take a deep breath. we're gonna do the torture thing.}
<A>__{he hits the button. an electric whine the big wheel turns. feet first into the water. struggling. arms stretched above her head. she plunges below the surface. a new dimension in pain. frozen, mind numbing. she writhes against the wheel. it's like a crushing vice is ripping her limb from limb. she opens her eyes, briefly. discovers she's not alone a mere foot from her face, the bloated corpse of the drowned nathan. staring away and away. blue with cyanosis. meanwhile, back on the surface: daedalus turns to his right hand man, who says:}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{we're running on schedule, i just secured the tanker. we're borrowing it from carbide in south carolina. cargo listed as fire retardant.}
<C>__{daedalus}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{juice up the bird, we head out soon as i'm done here.}
<A>__{he turns. hits the red button again. the wheel reverses itself. creaks and moans, turning samantha breaks the surface. gasping for air. wheezing. choking. the freezing wind plasters the nightgown to her.}
<C>__{daedalus}
<D>__{take all the air you can, that's right. if you need to vomit, do it now.}
<A>__{samantha, face twisted. coughs. wheezes. timothy looks her in the eye... shakes his head:}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{you don't remember at all...? the greatest night of your life, shit, drown this ungrateful wench.}
<A>__{he exits. daedalus, alone with his captive. on her features, unbridled hatred. he chuckles:}
<C>__{daedalus}
<D>__{talk to me colonel. is my identity safe...? the truth, and i will shoot you in the head. nice and quick. otherwise, you're in for a long night. who did you talk to?}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{...nobody... fuck you...}
<A>__{he shakes his head, makes a "tsk tsk" gesture. smiles grimly as he turns his attention to the red switch.}
<C>__{daedalus}
<D>__{hate to see you like this, charly. i heard you were a helluva spy once.}
<A>__{without warning, her head snaps upward eyes cold. voice, not her own:}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{watch your back. i'm not done yet.}
<C>__{daedalus}
<D>__{that's a very funny joke. you're an entertaining woman. good night.}
<A>__{he hits the button. she plunges beneath the surface. daedalus walks over to one corner. sits down. takes out a pipe. lights it. picks up a book. reads. and reads. underwater sam thrashes and jerks, to and fro. dead nathan, mocking her. there, under the water, the memories come... in a flood. stark and vivid. memory flash the year the trunk of a car opens, revealing a patch of night sky. mostly obscured by two familiar individuals there's one eyed jack, remember him? few years younger. one eyeball heavier. the other man is timothy. he looks in the trunk. nods.}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{okay, i will signal daedalus. your money will be waiting, and jack...? do yourself a favor, do her and dump her, i'm serious. don't get cute, try to play doctor first. i made that mistake.}
<A>__{the lid slams shut.}
<B>__{back under the water}
<A>__{the world of rushing madness, memories unspooling now, faster and faster memory flash: a cliff overlooking the ocean. darkness. sheeting rain. our heroine (for it is unquestionably samantha) is lying unconscious atop a rocky bluff. drenched. one eyed jack produces a syringe from a leather case. rolls up her sleeve. starts to administer the injection. stops. he can't resist... can't help loosening the buttons on her shirt. her eyes snap open. and before it even registers, she's grabbed the hypodermic and plunged it deep into his eye then she's up and running. along the cliff, toward the car... jack, howling in pain, stumbling... draws his gun and shoots her. in the head. she pitches backward. tumbles from the cliff...! rushes headlong toward the waters below, getting smaller }
