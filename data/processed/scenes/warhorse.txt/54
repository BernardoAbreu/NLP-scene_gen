<A>__{there are joey and topthorn, still waiting. and then suddenly the doors of the windmill creak. the two horses turn, immensely aware of the break in the silence. the door opens a little and we see, reflected in joey's eye, a very delicate, beautiful, thirteen year old country girl (emilie). she stares at the horses. they stare straight back at her. and she walks straight out again, closing the big door behind her. joey and topthorn settle for a moment. time transition joey and topthorn are in a slightly different place and the door opens again. it is the same little girl but this time she comes in carrying two buckets full of water.}
