<D>__{drop with the receiver and goes on talking}
<P>__{into the air)}
<D>__{they didn't miss me good night, pimenov...}
<A>__{she is about to replace the receiver. she sits with it in her hand, unreplaced. the music has stopped. the room is strangely silent. behind her the baron peers from the closet. her head sinks down upon her hands. a funny, singing noise comes from the telephone. she lifts the receiver to her ear. in a very strange voice, the voice of opehlia, she speaks:}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<P>__{(with great humility)}
<D>__{oh i'm sorry, yes... i have finished.}
<P>__{(she replaces the receiver)}
<A>__{the foregoing scene is much better played than described. it is in fact, ballet. quite calmly, grusinskaya finishes the notes on the table. she folds it up and places it in a prominent place on the table, or hangs it over the telephone. she crosses to the window pulls back the curtains the baron has been hiding behind a few minutes before. we see the baron watching. he glances at the door quickly. "no, there is not time." she is returning calmly. she crosses to the dressing table and takes the veronal out of a drawer. she looks at it thoughtfully, her lips are trembling a little. she moves to the radiator as if to seek warmth. she sinks into a chair and her head droops over her folded hands which contain the veronal, she seems to pray. the baron comes from the closet now is his chance, he looks at the door but can't make it. looks on the floor for the key which grusinskaya has previously thrown there, his eyes fall upon the note on the telephone he reads it. it is a death farewell note to suzette do not insert it. at this moment she has finished, the baron returns to his hiding place. she makes the sign of a cross and goes to her bed. she looks around nervously, apprehensively like a deer who has heard something, then reassured. she places the veronal on the night table beside the glass of water. she is quiet and deliberate. she arranges the pillows under her head and lies down. she reaches for the bottle of veronal and empties it generously in her hand. she has to lean away upon one elbow, from the baron's position, in order to balance herself. the baron steps like a cat from his hiding place. he goes to the bedside noiselessly and stands there. she reaches for the glass her hand stretches out for the glass. the baron takes her wrist suddenly. she turns quickly looking at him. the glass falls to the floor with a crash and breaks. as she moves, the veronal falls out of her hands upon the bed. she struggles up to a sitting position.}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{please, do not be alarmed, madam.}
<A>__{she glances up at him. she is bewildered. she seems to be coming out of a trance. again she wants to jump from the bed.}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{careful there's broken glass on the floor.}
<A>__{now she becomes conscious of almost nakedness. she draws her kimono tightly around her, glances across the wide expanse of bed. we see her consider passing over that way, but she is now a woman again a woman of the earth it would be a silly movement.}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{there.}
<P>__{(takes a pillow from}
<D>__{the bed throws it upon the floor over the glass, steps}
<P>__{back)}
<A>__{she gets up quickly and crosses, putting on her robe which was lying across the back of a chair. her first movement is not one of alarm but of shame. she draws her robe more closely around her and looks at the baron puzzled. she thinks, dreamily, "what is this?" she glances back at the veronal and the bed showing us plainly that this man must have watched her preparation for bed. we get a sense of relief with her. she is trembling. the baron has controlled his nerves perfectly. he senses his danger. he is caught red handed with five hundred thousand marks worth of pearls in his pocket. he is wondering if she will ring the bell. for an instant he thinks of escape. he could dash for the balcony. he could strike her dead or silence her with threats. there is in the room an intoxicating sense of romance and danger. (it should be in the scene.)}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{please do not be frightened, madam.}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<P>__{(after a silence)}
<D>__{what do you want here?}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{nothing only to be here.}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{why do you hide in my room?}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{but surely you must know because i love you.}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{because you love me you love me?}
<A>__{she looks at him for a few moments and then suddenly she throws herself upon the bed and begins to weep more and more passionately.}
<C>__{baron}
<P>__{(going over to her)}
<D>__{poor little grusinskaya! does it do you good to cry? are you afraid? shall i go?}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{i was so alone always alone and suddenly you were there and said that.}
<P>__{(sitting up)}
<D>__{no. i am not afraid. it is strange.}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{don't cry it tears my heart to see you sob like that.}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<P>__{(regaining control)}
<D>__{nerves just nerves. you must forgive me. i have had a bad evening. i am very tired. do you know what it is to be tired tired of a routine existence?}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{i'm afraid not i usually do just what i feel like doing at the moment.}
<A>__{a look in his eyes reminds her of the strangeness of the situation. she rises with returning dignity and pulls her robe around her she is becoming the grusinskaya of imperial russia; she is the woman grand dukes have fought for. she sweeps across the room.}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{so you feel like coming into a lady's room and you come... what now?}
<C>__{baron}
<P>__{(following her)}
<D>__{i'd like to smoke a cigarette.}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{certainly.}
<A>__{she gets her cigarette box from the writing table and holds it out to him. he takes a cigarette and lights it. she watches him curiously. she smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale the smoke. she crosses and sits before her looking glass. she brushes her hair back and powders her face. she looks into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to live. he crosses and looks at her in the mirror. he smiles.}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{why do you look at me like that?}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{i did not know you were so beautiful... and }
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{and then ?}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{no irony. you're so appealing so soft so tired. i feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you ever.}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<P>__{(involuntarily closing her eyes)}
<D>__{and and }
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{how tired you are!}
<C>__{grusinskaya}

<D>__{strange man...}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{am i quite strange to you?}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{not quite strange now. it is as if i had been expecting you. you know, once when the grand duke was alive, i found a man hiding in my room a young officer }
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{and...?}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{he disappeared. later he was found dead.}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{i never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone.}
<P>__{(he embraces her)}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{go away. who are you ?}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{a man who could love that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{you could love me. it is so long since i have heard that word. nobody has loved me for a long time. it is so icy cold to be famous. one is so cruelly alone. how is it that you let me look at you. your hands. your eyes. why could you love me?}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{i saw you just now then i saw you cry and now i see you in the mirror grusinskaya...}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{grusinskaya... oh oh if you knew how i slaved and slaved for grusinskaya for the success of grusinskaya for the triumph of grusinskaya... and what is she now? just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases are you listening to me do you understand? i want you to understand.}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{yes i do understand.}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{i think you must go now the key is on the floor.}
<C>__{baron}

<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{i want to be alone.}

<D>__{that is not so you don't want to be alone.}

<D>__{bed as if remembering}
<P>__{the suicide.)}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{i want to be alone }
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{no you don't want to be alone at all you were in despair before if i left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, you must not be alone you mustn't cry you must forget... tell me that i can stay with you tell me.}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{just for a minute then.}
<A>__{outside the distant noise of kringelein is heard }
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{what? say it again i didn't hear.}
<A>__{she whispers.}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{you man...}
<A>__{the way she says it, the word goes home. it hurts him. she has looked into his eyes for a moment with a strangely melting and almost happy expression. she gets up suddenly. (note: the other side of the bed not where the glass is) she reaches with her feet for her slippers. she puts one on. she can't find the other. business as he gets other slipper for her. he kisses her ankle and looks up at her. she smiles down.}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{thank you you are gallant.}
<P>__{(she turns, her mood has changed)}
<D>__{what a sentimental scene. grusinskaya weeping is a sight worth seeing. it is many years since she did such a thing... you frightened me badly. you're responsible for this painful scene.}
<A>__{he watches her. the sound of her own voice reassures her. she is generating warmth. her cry has done her good, she speaks quickly, volubly.}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{the stage frays one's nerves... the discipline it's so exacting. discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. do you know what i mean? have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{i? oh, no. i do only what i take pleasure in doing.}
<A>__{grusinskaya turns, she is graceful again.}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{i see you do only what you take pleasure in doing. you take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. you take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... and what is your pleasure now?}
<C>__{baron}
<P>__{(naive as he says frankly)}
<D>__{i should like to smoke.}
<A>__{she rises. she had expected something else. his reply strikes her as chivalrous and considerate. she crosses to the writing table brings back her little cigarette box which she holds out to him. he takes a cigarette and lights it. she watches him curiously. she smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale the smoke. she crosses and sits before her looking glass. she brushes her hair back and powders her face. she looks into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to live. he crosses and looks at her in the mirror, he smiles.}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{why do you smile?}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{because i can see something in the mirror that you cannot. my dear }
<P>__{(he pauses suddenly)}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{what can you see?}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{you are beautiful!}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{beautiful but so sad. i did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.}
<A>__{suddenly he stoops, takes her shoulder in his hands and kisses it. a long tender and sincere embrace. her eyes close. a tremor passes through her. suddenly his whole being is aware of her. she turns, rises and disengages herself.}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{i think you had better go now. the key is on the floor.}
<A>__{he glances back. he speaks suddenly with an air of command.}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{i'm not going... you know that i'm not going... do you think i could leave you alone here? after that ?}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{the veronal you. i'm going to stay here with you.}
<C>__{grusinskaya}

<P>__{(he almost shakes her)}
<A>__{her head falls slowly on his breast.}

<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{for just a minute then.}
<P>__{(she pulls away,}
<D>__{crosses the room, quickly to the door, with almost a cry. she looks around for}
<P>__{the key to the door)}
<D>__{no oh, no!}
<A>__{he crosses quickly to her and holds her in his arms.}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{just for a minute, grusinskaya }
<A>__{outside the distant noise of kringelein and the doctor.}
<B>__{front on shot of kringelein}
<A>__{approaching the camera with the doctor. they are returning from the bar and are passing grusinskaya's room. the camera precedes them. the doctor is characteristically drunk. he is silent, tense, cynical. a distinct contrast to kringelein, whose soul is warmed for the first time by alcohol. kringelein's hat, the same, eccentric one, is twisted upon his head jauntily. the carnation is in his buttonhole. the camera backs into kringelein's room and pauses, because the doctor has paused at the door.}
<C>__{kringelein}
<D>__{oh, but doctor. isn't this wonderful. to live to live in the grand hotel.}
<C>__{doctor}
<P>__{(with a deprecating gesture)}
<D>__{the grand hotel.}
<C>__{kringelein}
<D>__{oh, but doctor. the music the champagne girls when they dance all the shining ice in those big silver things that's life }

<C>__{kringelein}
<P>__{(to doctor)}
<D>__{but doctor }
<A>__{but the doctor has gone. kringelein re enters his beautiful room. he crosses to the mirror, regards himself. business ad lib. he looks at himself in the mirror and raises his hat. imitating the doctor, he repeats:}
<C>__{kringelein}
<D>__{mr. kringelein you are drunk good night.}
<A>__{he puts his hat on the knob of the bed. he takes off his coat, holds it up and carefully takes the carnation out of his buttonhole. with the coat over his arm and the carnation in his hand he looks around for a glass and some water which he sees standing on the night table by his bed. he puts the carnation in the glass, having filled it with water and then his eyes fall upon his small group of medicine bottles. his demeanor changes. he immediately becomes a thing of pain. he glances at his watch it is long past his medicine time his spirit droops he might almost be in pain. he picks up a small bottle and carefully counts eight drops into the glass. he is about to take it, he smells it, a sudden impulse of well being surges over him. he flings the medicine away. with a great wave of optimism he commences to sing the song that we have heard during the evening the chambermaid song the preysing radio song the love song. he saunters around the room, undressing.}
