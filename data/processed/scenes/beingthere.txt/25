<C>__{chance}
<D>__{i never needed money.}
<A>__{franklin steps to the tv, turns it off.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{mr. chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address a driver's license, a credit card, checkbook?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{no, i do not have any of those.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{then how about medical records? could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{i have no need for a doctor or dentist. i have never been ill. i have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for joe, i have never had any visitors.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{... joe? who's joe?}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(turns tv back on)}
<D>__{joe saracini. he was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. that was in 1952.}

<D>__{yes and the old man used to come to my garden. he would read and rest there.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{come now, mr. jennings had been bedridden for thirty five years, since he fractured his spine.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes, thomas, that is correct. then he stopped visiting my garden.}
<C>__{franklin}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{... we shall need some proof of your having resided here, mr. chance.}
<C>__{chance}
