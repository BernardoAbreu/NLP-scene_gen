<A>__{camera pulls back to show that the owner of tie voice is rocklin, who has almost finished shaving. as he scrapes his chin and whistles, peering at himself in the little cracked mirror, he hears the sound of the door opening and turns, then ducks quickly as a boot flies past him, just missing the mirror. there is the sound of the door slamming and rocklin grins. he picks up the boot and goes to the door leading to dave's room.}
