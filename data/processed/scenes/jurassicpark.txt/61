<L>__{ext grant's tree dawn}
<A>__{camera look down on grant, lex and timmy still sleeping in the tree. a large shadow falls on their quiet faces. lex opens an eye. she screams. grant and timmy wake up with a start. their pov as the camera looks through their legs and tilts up right into the huge face of a duck billed hadrosaur, a gigantic dinosaur with cow eyes. its head moves up through the canopy of the trees. then the head swoops way down below. and returns to grant's level and stares at his shoe. the hadrosaur tastes grant's shoe. the kids press tightly into grant.}

<D>__{... herbivore.}
<A>__{the hadrosaur honks. lex covers her ears. grant smiles and motions to lex. he picks a big fruit off the tree and tosses it into the hadrosaur's mouth. chomp. he feeds it again. lex and timmy toss a few. chomp! chomp! honk! honk! the hadrosaur's big head swoops way down, momentarily gone. when she returns, all three quickly gather fruits and throw them into her mouth. the hadrosaur pulls back with her giant mouthful of fruit. she pulls further and further back and then her huge head turns and moves down. grant, lex and timmy strain to see through the branches. their pov the hadrosaur is feeding four scampering, baby hadrosaurs. letting the fruit tumble from her mouth into theirs. lex yells:}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{come here, babies! get your b}
<A>__{reakfast! the babies run to the base of the tree. the kids toss fruits right down to them. lex and timmy climb lower to feed them right from their hands. grant and the mother hadrosaur stare at each other. she sniffs his foot. he moves closer, straddling a branch. he lifts up her lip and examines her gums. close on a ripped piece of fence stuck in her teeth. grant yanks it out. he lets it drop to the ground. he take a large leaf and rubs her teeth with it. close on her mouth as grant's hand touches the side of her tongue. he sees little tiny bumps. the hadrosaur lets out a low groan. grant is puzzled, rubs harder.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{like the trike. maybe it's not the stones.}
<A>__{honk! she pulls her mouth away. the baby hadrosaurs turn to the honking adult. she is leaving quickly. they follow quickly behind her. the small herd leaves, casually trampling trees as they go.}
