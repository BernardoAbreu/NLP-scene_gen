<L>__{interior hall}
<A>__{racine crosses the dark living room fast. as he reaches matty, she lifts her arms to match his embrace. they come together hard and tight. they kiss. and kiss again. her hands travel over his body, as though she's wanted them there for a long time. they turn once slowly along the wall, into the dimness of the central hall. then he rotates her body away from him, holding her close.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{yes, yes...}
<A>__{then she is just nodding. racine puts his face deep into her hair, closing his eyes as the smell of her washes over him. matty turns in his arms and kisses him hard. racine pulls her close to him and they sink to the floor.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{that's right... that's right.}
<A>__{close on matty's face, a look that might be anguish. she bites her lip in expectation. racine moves over her.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{please, please ...}
<A>__{she pulls him tightly to her, clinging like a drowning woman.}
