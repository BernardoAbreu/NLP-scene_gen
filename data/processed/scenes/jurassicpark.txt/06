<A>__{donald gennaro, handsome, meticulously dressed, paces the highly polished, glassy corner suite. his boss, ross, is seated. he's a powerful black man who waves a prosthetic arm.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{we can't trust hammond anymore. he's under too much pressure. there's the epa, he's behind schedule, and the in vestors are getting nervous. there have been too many rumors, too many accidents. we can't screw around with this.}
<C>__{gennaro}
<D>__{i've asked hammond to arrange independent site inspections every week for the next three weeks.}
<C>__{ros}
<B>__{s}
<D>__{what does he say?}
<C>__{gennaro}
<D>__{insists nothing's wrong on the island.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{you know him. do you believe him?}
<C>__{gennaro}
<D>__{no, i don't. i spent a lot of time with him five years ago when we raised the capital. and it was a wild ride. he's unpredictable, a dreamer.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{potentially dangerous. we should never have gotten involved. what's our position?}
<C>__{gennaro}
<D>__{the firm owns five percent.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{general or limited?}
<C>__{gennaro}
<D>__{general.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{we should have never done that.}
<C>__{gennaro}
<D>__{it seemed wise at the time. we all wanted the park to happen. it was in lieu of fees.}
<C>__{ross}
<A>__{in any case, i agree an inspection is}
<D>__{overdue. who are your site experts?}
<A>__{gennaro tosses a list on ross' desk. he check it out.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{will they tell the truth?}
<C>__{gennaro}
<D>__{i think so. that guy grant's a hotshot in his field, always goes his own way }
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{ good. you're making all the arrangements?}
<C>__{gennaro}
<D>__{hammond asked to place the calls himself. i think he wants to pretend the park is not in trouble. that it's just a social invitation, showing off the island.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{all right ... good. but let's be very clear about one thing. i don't know how bad this situation actually is, donald. but if there's a problem on that island don't be afraid to screw hammond and burn jurassic park to the ground.}
<A>__{gennaro shakes hands awkwardly with ross and leaves. ross paces. fed up, he whispers to himself.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{costa rica, my ass.}
<A>__{he whacks his desk globe, sends its spinning. camera moves in on spinning globe as we hear the rotor blades of a helicopter and dissolve to:}
