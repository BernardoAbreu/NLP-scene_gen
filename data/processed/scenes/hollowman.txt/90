<L>__{interior sebastian's bedroom night}
<A>__{sebastian packs up a few personal belongings in an overnight duffle. he crosses to his bookcase and pulls out some books and throws them into the bag. but as he does, he notices a light come on in the window across the courtyard. sebastian turns off his bedroom light and moves toward the window. he peers across the courtyard into the brunette's apartment. he watches the brunette as she comes into the living room from her front hallway. she drops her keys on the table and begins unbuttoning her blouse as she crosses to the window. just as the blouse slips off her shoulder, she pulls her blinds shut.}

<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{frustrated, sebastian steps away from the window and then stops. something has occurred to him.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{don't even think it...}
<A>__{he looks down and notices his hand is trembling. his breathing is a little heavy. a little nervous. he catches a glimpse at himself in the mirror.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<P>__{(almost whispering)}
<D>__{once...just once.}
<A>__{the brunette's living room light switches off and the bathroom light switches on. we see him fighting an internal battle and we see him lose it. he grabs a hold of his hand and peels the latex skin off.}
