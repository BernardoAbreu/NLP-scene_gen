<L>__{interior airport japan day}
<A>__{ mcqueen's smiling face, on a team mcqueen poster. reverse to reveal mater looking at it, sadly. he drives on, passing (but not noticing) grem and acer. at the security check moments later. cars take off their tires, move through the metal detector. mater waits in line. a security car approaches mater.}
<C>__{security car}
<P>__{(in japanese and english)}
<D>__{come with me please, sir.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{but i'm gonna miss my plane.}
<A>__{in the admiral's lounge moments later. the security car leads mater inside.}
<C>__{security car}
<D>__{right this way.}
<A>__{as they move past us the security car covertly drops a ball bearing which rolls into a corner. the ball bearing then sprouts mechanical legs, tripods itself and irises out, revealing itself to be a tiny camera. in the main room admiral's lounge continuous mater follows the security car in, nervous.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{doggone it. this is about my hook, isn't it? i know i should've checked it, but i can't really, look it's attached to me.}
<A>__{zwapppppp!! the security car suddenly decloaks himself, reveals himself to be finn mcmissile!}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{hey, i know you. you're that feller from the karate demonstration.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{i never properly introduced myself. finn mcmissile. british intelligence.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{tow mater. average intelligence.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{who are you with? fbi, cia?}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{let's just say i'm triple a affiliated. you know, i know some karate. i don't wanna brag or nothing, but i've got me a black fan belt.}
<A>__{beep! finn's rearview alarms. his camera has picked up grem and acer. they've just entered the lounge, are right around the corner.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{hey, you wanna see some moves i made up?}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{you're being followed.}
<A>__{finn quickly turns, fires a tiny glass cutting beetle at the window. as mater talks, oblivious, the beetle cuts out a round hole.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{this first one i can reach into a car's hood, pull out his battery, and show it to him before he stalls. i call it, "what i accidentally did to my friend luigi once."}
<A>__{mater does his best (worst) karate moves as acer and grem turn the corner.}
<C>__{grem}
<D>__{there he is!}
<A>__{the glass drops away, leaving a car sized hole.}
<C>__{mater}
<P>__{(eyes the clock)}
<D>__{look, i probably ought to go. i'm about to miss my flight.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{don't worry.}
<A>__{finn hooks mater from behind. he yanks him forward }
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{i've taken care of that. hang on.}
<A>__{ and leaps out the window!}
