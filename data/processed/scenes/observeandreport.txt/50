<L>__{interior mall food court day}
<A>__{ronnie walks into the food court and sees nell waiting at their table with ronnie's morning cinnabon. he takes a deep breath and heads over.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{hey, sweetie oh, i'm sorry, good morning, officer barnhardt.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{good morning, nell.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{where were you last night? i tried to call, but your mom said you weren't home from work yet.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{look, i got to talk to you about something. i'm not really sure how to put this. let's see. if you drove a toyota.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i drive a ford.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i know, but let's just pretend you drove a toyota. now, this toyota runs really good. it always starts when you need it to and it gets good gas mileage and you don't have to do much to maintain it. then you get a really important job like astronaut, no that won't work, you get a job as the head of wall street. well, you may really like that toyota, but you're going to feel weird about driving it to work every day, right? now let's say that somebody offers you a chance to get rid of that toyota and instead you get a ferrari. it may be more expensive and harder to drive, but i mean, it just looks good as hell. what would you do?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i don't get it.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you would trade up, nell. well, that's exactly what i'm doing.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{are you thinking about getting a new car?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{no, nell, i'm getting a new girlfriend.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{what?! who?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{this girl, brandi.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{the slutty girl who works at the make up counter?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yeah, i mean, no, she's not a slut. but you're thinking of the right person.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{how could you do this to me?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i don't mean to hurt you. it's just, well, i believe in this world, you play the hand you're dealt and at this point in my life, i've been dealt five aces. i'd be a fool not to bet.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{why are you doing this, ronnie?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i have to, nell.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{don't you love me?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{of course i love you.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{then tell me why?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{because i've never dated the prom queen before.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{remember when you started this job? you weren't such a hotshot then. i've stood by you when you were at your worst. every time you fell, i held your hand and told you everything would be okay. time and time again.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{come on. why do you have to bring that up?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i never cared about who you wanted to be, i fell in love with who you really are. if you leave me, ronnie, i won't be there to pick you up when you fall.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{even if i do fall, it won't matter, because i'm learning to fly.}
<A>__{ronnie stands up and walks away. nell sits there sad. she looks down at her cinnabon and devours the whole thing.}
