<A>__{nicole stands motionless as a few more emaciated puffs of smoke hang in the air.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i am so hungry.}
<A>__{tito enters, walks around her holding the apple just beyond her reach then moves to his mark. the camera dollies into a cu. he does not laugh.}
<L>__{interior the set. day}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{cut.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{that's a cut. going again, nick?}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{ok, ellen, good. you're on to something there.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{no, something's not right. it all feels fake to me.}
<A>__{nick's tone with nicole suddenly takes on an almost imperceptible edge, tinged with annoyance.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{well, it's not fake; it's real. just remember, you really want the apple. tito, i still think we could see more of a laugh at the end.}
<C>__{tito}
<D>__{what kind of laugh?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{just a laugh.}
<C>__{tito}
<D>__{show me.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{oh, ok. a laugh. i'm thinking maybe like this. ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.}
<A>__{everyone watches nick demonstrate the laugh. he seems unaware he resembles a drunken, slightly annoyed idiot.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{something like that. ok? and remember, tito, this is a dream. not everything has to make sense. a laugh right there heightens our sense of... of...}
<C>__{tito}
<D>__{anxiety.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{exactly. wolf, how was that for you?}

<D>__{well, god damn it! it's not going to be! it's on the dolly so just forget about it!}
<A>__{there is a strained moment of silence on the set as everyone witnesses this rebuke.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{and bob, what the fuck is that smoke? might as well get a couple hamsters in here blowing smoke rings for christ's sake.}
<C>__{gaffer}
<D>__{the septic valve wasn't open. i got it now. we're going to see some smoke now.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{alright, let's try another take.}
<C>__{wanda}

<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{nick, could i talk to you for a minute?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what?!}

<D>__{in private.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(sighs in exasperation)}
