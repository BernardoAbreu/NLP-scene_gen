<L>__{interior senate chamber night}
<A>__{we observe the romulan crest, an imposing bird of prey clutching a planet in either claw, not unlike the kaos emblem from "get smart," that dominates a wall. as we hear:}
<C>__{shinzon }
<D>__{consider it the great symbol of the empire... but the bird of prey holds planets. romulus, remus. their destinies conjoined...}
<A>__{and then we see him... shinzon! he is a dynamic young human in his twenties. very handsome with pale, almost white skin and shining, golden hair. he wears a striking reman military uniform. he stands in the center of the eerily deserted chamber. the entire floor is a large star chart.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{yet for generations one of those planets has been without a voice. we will be silent no longer.}
<A>__{senator tal'aura (the female senator who planted the weapon in the senate chamber earlier) and two other romulan commanders sit. cadres of shinzon's fearsome reman warriors stand around the chamber. they are his sinister children of the night. even more chilling now in the flickering torch light. it's like something out of tim burton. donatra and suran enter the chamber with shinzon's viceroy.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{join us, commanders. now what's the disposition of the fleet?}
<C>__{suran}
<D>__{they're holding position.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{suran}
<P>__{(bows his head)}
<D>__{they will obey, praetor.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{it's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath.}
<C>__{donatra}
<D>__{they support your intentions, sir. but they require evidence of your... sincerity.}
<A>__{shinzon looks at her. a quick beat. shinzon decides to respond with benevolence. he smiles.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{and they'll have it.}
<P>__{(he begins to pace over the star chart)}
<D>__{tell the fleet that the days of negotiation and diplomacy are over. the almighty federation will fall before us. as i promised you.}
<A>__{he stands on the area of the map that denotes the neutral zone between the romulan empire and the federation.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{the time we have dreamed of is at hand. the time... of conquest.}
<P>__{(sinister laugh)}
<A>__{he carefully steps into the area of the map marked with the federation symbol. he looks down at the star chart.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{cut off the dragon's head and it cannot strike back.}
<A>__{a beat. donatra watches him carefully. something in his quiet words disturbs her.}
<C>__{suran}
<D>__{how many warbirds will you need?}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{none.}
<A>__{they look at him, stunned.}
<C>__{suran}
<D>__{praetor. you have the whole fleet at your disposal. they supported the coup, they'll follow you.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{the scimitar will serve my needs.}
<C>__{suran}
<D>__{but surely }
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{i came this far alone...}
<P>__{(he looks at his reman warriors)}
<D>__{we came this far alone. we require no assistance from the fleet. now leave me to my thoughts.}
<A>__{the commanders and senator tal'aura rise and leave. shinzon looks to his viceroy.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{are we prepared?}
<C>__{viceroy}
<D>__{yes, praetor.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{so many years for this moment.}
<P>__{(he looks up at his viceroy, smiles)}
<D>__{bring him to me.}
