<A>__{as do the rest of the all blacks. we have segued to the famous haka, a maori war dance that tells an opponent they're going have their daughters stolen, their wives ravaged and their brains eaten right out of their skulls with a sharpened tea spoon. it is abundantly clear why, as the minister of sports told mandela, half of the all blacks matches are won before the whistle blows. this is very intimidating. especially because, this day, the all blacks push the haka closer and closer to the springboks who do not back down. in fact, they close ranks and advance. major, major international smackdown. this is not fake. the emotions, the aggression are real. on mandela, whose diplomatic mask slips a little showing a warrior's glitter in his eyes. he wants to respond, primally. his fists clench at his side. the haka ends with a fearsome, guttural maori yell. on the springboks, massed together, faces red with emotion, pulses racing. mandela takes a deep breath in. then the boys answer. with, of course, a terrorist anthem of their own: nkosi sikelel' iafrika. pienaar starts it.}
