<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{if we're for real?}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{you don't exactly look like drug dealers.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{isn't that the point?}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{yeah, well, i don't have time to screw around. i got buyers in dallas, houston and vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we appreciate that. but you just poured me a drink, i'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{fine. you got five...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's a nice place you got here. real comfortable. sweet little town, fair oaks. you like it here?}
<C>__{del}

<D>__{are you kidding me? what's to like?}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{seems like a nice place.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{it is, if you like idiots...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{it's a small town, man. i never should have left omaha. people here think small. they act small. they're a bunch of dumb fucks.}

<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{i don't follow...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you're not a dumb fuck, are you, del?}
<C>__{del}
<P>__{(warily)}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i didn't think so. so, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{are we gonna do business here, or not?}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{relax, we brought the cash.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm just curious. can't you give me an example?}
<C>__{del}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{all right ... lemme see ... okay, new burger king opens up. these assholes get excited and start lining up. like it's some five star restaurant. the place is mobbed. right?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hmmmm. "five stars," huh?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{is that stupid, wesley?}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{no, that's ignorant. they just don't know any better.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that's what i thought.}
<P>__{(to del)}
<D>__{you better give me another example.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{this is bullshit, can we get down to business here, please?}
<A>__{off a look from charlie, wesley produces a pistol and gently nudges the barrel into del's ear.}
<C>__{del }
<D>__{jesus christ!}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{he's waiting...}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{okay, uh... the, umm, injuns're stupid.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{"injuns?"}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you did not just say "injuns," del.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{the indians, injuns, whatever. they're always drunk and doing stupid things.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{let's see... around here that would be kiowa, kickapoo or osage, if i'm not mistaken.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{i... i don't know...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so here's how this is gonna work. would you take your socks off, please?}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{my socks?}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{you heard the man.}
<A>__{del slowly takes his shoes and socks off. he's sweating, trembling.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm gonna talk to you and when i'm finished, you can answer. but i don't like being interrupted. now roll them into a ball...}
<A>__{del does it.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{oh, jesus, please... please, god.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{... and put them in your mouth.}
<A>__{at a sharp look from charlie, del obediently stuffs the socks into his mouth and starts to cry. wesley produces a roll of duct tape and fastens del's hands to the back of his chair.}
