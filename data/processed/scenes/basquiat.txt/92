<L>__{interior palladium huge room night}
<A>__{jean and albert milo sit on a banquette a huge white painting of jean's with a dragon's head hangs on one wall to their left. on the opposite wall in back of the bar hangs another huge painting with a lot of heads, mostly black. lots of people mill about a huge room. a girl another gina look alike walks through the crowd. jean's eyes follow her momentarily..}

<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{albert milo}
<D>__{i like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. but the black one's filled up with too many heads...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'd take some of them out.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i think you're painting too fast. i wouldn't put in so many heads. let it breathe a bit.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{it's always how you would do it. this is my version.}
<C>__{albert milo}
<D>__{you're right. it's your version. you should come over to the studio sometime.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{why, so you could humiliate me?}
<C>__{albert milo}
<D>__{no, i wanted to make a painting of you.}
