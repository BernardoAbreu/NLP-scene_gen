<L>__{interior inner sanctum of dr. tyrell day}
<A>__{the office is dimly lit, but highlights of resilience reside in the luster of the antique furnishings, like glimmers of gold in a darkened mine. dr. tyrell is a fragile man of power, with that look of "youth" obtained from steroids and surgery. dapper and trim, he leans against the desk looking at an old fashioned pocket watch. the only sound is the insidious perking of coffee brewing in the background. tyrell taps a sensor on his desk. the door in front of deckard and rachael slides open. they enter a vestibule and face another door, this one befitting the decor of the office, tyrell slips the watch into his pocket as they enter.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{mr. deckard. dr. eldon tyrell.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{how do you do, mr. deckard. please sit down. would you care for a cup of coffee?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{black?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{tyrell pours from an old time sylex into small china cups and hands one to deckard. the congenial light in his eyes could almost pass for warmth dragon warmth.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{somehow, i didn't expect that the man who did the dirty work would be the man to do the technical work. here you are, mr. deckard.}
<A>__{he hands deckard a cup of coffee.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{is this to be an empathy test?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{capillary dilation of the so called blush response? plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris?}
<A>__{deckard nods.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{may i ask a personal question?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{have you ever retired a human by mistake?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{but in your profession that is a risk.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{nothing is infallible, but so far the voight kampff scale bas been foolproof.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{like you said, mr. deckard, a machine can be a hazard. the voight kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{one that relies on human interpretation. where's the subject?}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{sitting next to you.}
<A>__{deckard stares at rachael, then back at tyrell. delighted, tyrell takes a cup of coffee. accepting the challenge, deckard opens his briefcase and starts fishing out the apparatus. the voight kampff rachael's eye fills the screen, the iris brilliant, shot with light, the pupil contracting.}
<C>__{deckard's voice}
<D>__{ready.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<A>__{in the soft green glow of the dials, the needles in both gauges are at rest. dr. tyrell stands silhouetted behind deckard, who sits in front of rachael, a pencil beam trained on her eye. wire mesh discs are attached to her cheeks.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{you're given a calfskin wallet for your birthday.}
<A>__{the needles in both gauges swing violently past green to red, then subside.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{i wouldn't accept it. also, i'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{you have a little boy. he shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.}
<A>__{again the gauges register, but not so far.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{i'd take him to the doctor.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{you're watching t.v. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{i'd kill it.}
<A>__{both needles go to red. deckard makes a note, takes a sip of coffee and continues.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{in a magazine you come across a full page photo of a nude girl.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{is this testing whether i'm an android or a lesbian?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{you show the picture to your husband. he likes it and hangs it on the wall. the girl is lying on a bearskin rug.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i wouldn't let him.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{i should be enough for him.}
<A>__{deckard frowns, then smiles. his smile looks a little like a grimace or the other way around.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{you become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{i'd never get an abortion.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{that would be murder, mr. deckard.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{in your opinion.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{it would be my child.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{sounds like you speaks from experience.}
<A>__{he notes the needles. one goes green and the other remains inert.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{last question. you're watching an old movie. it shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{ugh.}
<A>__{both needles swing swiftly.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{the entree consists of boiled dog stuffed with rice.}
<A>__{needles move less.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{the raw oysters are less acceptable to you than a dish of boiled dog.}
<A>__{deckard moves the adhesive discs from her cheeks and switches off his beam.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{lights please.}
<A>__{the lights come on.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{if she is, the machine works.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{the machine works. she is.}
<A>__{rachael sits very still. except her eyes they go to tyrell and hang on. he stares back at her as he speaks.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{how many questions did it take?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{thirteen.}
<A>__{rachael sits rigidly in her chair, as the ground crumbles around her, her big mermaid eyes locked with tyrell. his voice is quiet and strong, mesmerizing. she's hang ing by a thread. deckard watches with a bas taste in his mouth.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{she didn't know?}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{memory implant. she was programmed. but i think she has transcended her conditioning. i think she was beginning to suspect.}
<A>__{rachael nods fixedly. careful not to let go her grasp.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{how many questions does it usually take, mr. deckard?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{five, maybe six.}
<A>__{slowly, carefully, tyrell unlocks his gaze from rachael and turns towards deckard, who is starting to put away his equipment.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{you're going to have to be on your toes, my friend.}
<A>__{deckard glances back at him.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{it's a complex problem and we wouldn't want anything to happen to you.}
<A>__{less of a man might shrink at the end of deckard's look, but not tyrell.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{for the good of all, i recommend you take rachael with you. considering her uniqueness, i'm sure she could prove quite helpful.}
<A>__{deckard almost smiles at the nasty power of tyrell's style. he turns away and starts packing up the voight kampff.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<A>__{deckard is ready to go.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{and how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{discreetly.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{all pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an esper 231 i believe and a photo over lay packet is being produced.}
<A>__{deckard opens the door.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{mr. deckard, i think it would be wise to reconsider my offer.}
<A>__{rachael sits there very pale and expressionless, her feet flat on the floor, alone is the word. trying to keep the fury out of it, deckard's voice comes out in a whisper.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i work alone.}
<A>__{on the last word, rachael glances up at him and deckard turns away. the outer door slides open and he goes through it.}
