<L>__{interior loading area day}
<A>__{nick plows into the loading area like a bullet, whipping around stacks of boxes and lumbering forklifts. a few workers attempt to stop him, but he's moving too fast. ahead, is a loading dock, raised four feet from the ground to accommodate semis. nick's heading for it. the loading door is open, and outside is freedom. just then, the steel loading door begins to grind and lower. some genius has hit the controls.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{pumps like mad, and he's really moving now. either he'll make it, or he's going to hit that steel door at about forty miles and hour...}
<B>__{the door}
<A>__{is quickly closing off nick's escape route. he's only got about four feet to negotiate... nick ducks low and clears it!}
