<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{the curtains are drawn and david's lunch waits patiently on its tray alongside of the bed. david is apparently asleep. alex enters softly.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{mr. kessler?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(lifeless)}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you haven't eaten your lunch.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'm not very hungry, thank you.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i'm afraid you have to eat something.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{please, really. i'm not hungry.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you put me in an awkward position, mr. kessler.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{how is that?}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(she shakes the paper cup)}
<D>__{well, you're to take these after you've eaten. now what kind of nurse would i be if i failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{leave the pills. i will take them later.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{she opens the curtains, daylight fills the room.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{aw come on, miss price!}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{call me alex.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{aw come on, alex!}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{shall i be forced to feed you, mr. kessler?}
<A>__{david is getting interested.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{call me david.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{shall i be forced to feed you, david?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{this is absurd. i'm not hungry. i don't want any food.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{alex efficiently removes the covers from the dishes and sits on the edge of the bed. taking knife and fork in hand, she neatly cuts david's food into pieces. david watches all this amused. she places a napkin under david's chin and holds up his first bite on his fork. david folds his arms and refuses to open his mouth.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{let's try a little harder, shall we?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{will you give me a break?}
<A>__{alex grabs david's nose forcing his mouth open quickly, shoving the fork in it. david is startled, but amused and chews his food slowly and swallows it. alex holds up another bite.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{will i have to take such drastic action again, david?}
<A>__{david opens his mouth obediently. alex almost smiles. she feeds him for a while; they are both sizing each other up. finally:}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{may i have a glass of milk?}
<A>__{alex smiles.}
