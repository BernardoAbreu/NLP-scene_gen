<L>__{interior containment lab night}
<A>__{okun and two medical assistants examine the alien creature. his arms and chest have been strapped down to the examining table. for the first time we get a good look at the head of this creature, long tentacled type cords interlocked, covering the face. the doctors attach clamps to each of the cords.}
<C>__{okun}
<D>__{everyone ready?}
<A>__{the doctors exchange nervous glances, nod to each other. at the same moment all they pull on the clamps, unraveling the interlocked cords. as the cords unravel, we see that this is in fact a bio mechanical suit as we reveal...}
<B>__{the alien}
<A>__{beneath the cords lay the unconscious face of the alien, his skin translucent, his body fluids, capillaries, muscle tissue, alien's skin.}
<C>__{okun}
<D>__{do we have life support monitors recording? med assist #2 yes. if we fuck up it'll all be on tape.}
<C>__{okun}
<D>__{can we get some ventilation in here? i can't take this smell. med assist #2 they've conquered space travel but not b.o.}
<A>__{as okun begins to put on a pair of surgical gloves he suddenly grabs his forehead.}
<D>__{med assist #1 you all right?}
<C>__{okun}
<D>__{yeah. it's just that stink gives me a headache. med assist #2 he's moving!}
<A>__{instantly everyone's attention is riveted to the arm of the alien as it moves beneath the sheet. unseen by the others the alien creature's}
<B>__{eyes open .}
<A>__{another sharp pain hits okun who screams, stumbling backwards grabbing his head. the others turn in surprise.}
<B>__{the alien}
<A>__{suddenly springs up, the restraining straps snapping. before med #2 can react, one of the alien's tentacles smashes her across the face. she is sent sprawling backwards. low angle the alien standing before her. in a wink of an eye, he attacks, leaping on her. together they tumble back into a formaldehyde tank. hoses are ripped from their sides and steam pours out. we get quick glimpse of their struggle as the steam engulfs them.}
