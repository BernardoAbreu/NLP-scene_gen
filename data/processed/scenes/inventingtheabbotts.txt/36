<L>__{exterior dirt road (countryside) day}
<A>__{the plymouth is parked on a dirt lane separating two cornfields. jacey sits on the fender of the car nursing on a bottle of beer. doug urinates between two rows of corn.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{remember that time i got my dick caught in my zipper?}
<A>__{jacey gives doug a quizzical look.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{you know, when i was in first grade. at school? in the boys' room? remember i wouldn't let mrs. horton help me, so she went and got mom out of her classroom, but i wouldn't let mom help me either. i told her to go get you. remember?}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{yeah, i remember.}
<A>__{doug retrieves his beer from the roof of the car. a semi trailer drives past with "midwest steel desk, inc. haley, illinois" painted on its sides.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{we should own that company.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{midwest steel desk. dad's file cabinet drawer. lloyd abbott screwed mom out of dad's patent after he died.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{says who?}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{it's true.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{mom's not stupid.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{i didn't say she was stupid. lloyd's pretty smooth. that's why he owns the company.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{he owns the company 'cause he married the boss's daughter.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{he owns the company 'cause that patent saved the company's ass after the war, when all the war contracts dried up.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{well, maybe mom sold it 'cause we needed the money.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{what money? we never had any money. money had nothing to do with it.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{then why did she sell the patent?}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{she just did, that's all that matters. and that's why we're driving this car and not that one.}
<A>__{jacey gestures to '57 thunderbird convertible speeding past them. he finishes off his beer, then:}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{i guess you'll just have to be real careful zipping up your pants while i'm gone.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{yeah.}
