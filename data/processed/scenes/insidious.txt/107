<L>__{interior kitchen, new house night}
<A>__{tucker, specs and elise convene in the kitchen, slumped amongst the boxes for the tech gear. all are in shock.}
<C>__{specs}
<D>__{i feel like a mountain climber who's been waiting his whole life to climb everest, and now that i'm standing on the summit, i don't know what to do with myself...}
<C>__{tucker}
<D>__{i will tell you what we do with ourselves. we make a short list of our preferred media outlets, that's what.}
<A>__{he holds up his video camera.}
<C>__{tucker }
<D>__{watch this.}
<A>__{he hits play on a monitor that his video camera is cabled to. chaotic images of dalton from the previous scene spit to life. behind dalton, we can just make out the blurry image of the red faced demon. puppeteering dalton from behind. controlling his limbs like a human marionette.}
<C>__{specs}
<D>__{oh my god...}
<C>__{tucker}
<D>__{after all the years we've been dining out on morsels like a faucet that turns itself on and off...we finally have some empirical evidence of the real thing. proof.}
<A>__{he hits pause on the video, freeze framing the hellish image.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{proof? proof of what? nine tenths of the world believes that when you die, your soul ascends to sit with god. would you be telling them something they didn't already know?}
<C>__{tucker}
<D>__{that is so not the pointerior this is not about religion. here we have irrefutable evidence of a paranormal experience. our job is to share it.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{no, our job is not to alert the press and prove the existence of the `paranormal', as you call it. i'm not out to prove anything. i've known there was a higher plane ever since i was a little girl and i could play hopscotch with people whose names were inscribed on tombstones. what you call paranormal is a fact of life for me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{our job is to help people. the least we can do is spare them the indignity of sixty minutes.}
<A>__{she snatches his camera away from him and stands up.}
<C>__{tucker}
<D>__{yeah, until they get their book deal...then you'll wish you'd listened.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{no, i won't, tucker. i will just be proud of you. you two stared down something that would crush most mortals tonight and you stood tall.}
<A>__{they manage a smile.}
<C>__{specs}
<D>__{so what do we do now?}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{we answer the door.}
<C>__{specs}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<A>__{there is a knock at the front door.}
