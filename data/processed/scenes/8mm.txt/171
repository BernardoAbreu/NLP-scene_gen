<L>__{interior welles' motel room night}
<A>__{welles is lit by the flicker from the television screen. we see nothing. we hear the rhythmic muffled moans of a woman from the tv, can't tell if it's pleasure or pain. max is asleep in the bed, pizza box near his feet. welles drinks beer, gets up and ejects the cassette from a vcr, tosses it aside, tired. he picks another dino velvet tape, puts it in, sits. on tv: gothic rock is heard over old, scratchy images: of klansmen around a burning cross... dracula menacing a sleeping woman... a man in a devil costume dancing... welles opens another beer. on tv: a woman is tied up, arms in the air, hanging from the ceiling, gagged and blindfolded, in a dungeon lit by candelabras. then, glimpsed images: worms writhing in slime... gargoyles... a guillotine falling. then, the bound woman, struggling. a masked man in a leather jacket enters. he wears a leather mask with zipper eyes and mouth... this focuses welles' attention. on tv: the masked man circles the captured woman...}

<D>__{max... wake up...}
<A>__{max awakens, rolling over, groggy.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{wha... ?}
<C>__{welles}
<P>__{(points at tv)}
<D>__{who is this, in the mask? who is he?}
<A>__{max tries to see, eyes barely open.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{he's one of the lunatics dino uses. he's in a bunch of these.}
<A>__{welles watches. on the tv, masked man takes off his jacket shirtless, reveals an impossibly muscled body. huge arms, thick chest, oiled, dotted in pimples.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{why? he have something to do with whatever you're into?}
<A>__{still watching the behemoth on tv, welles is less sure. on tv: the bulging masked man flexes, ripped.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{no... it's nothing... that's not him.}
<A>__{welles rubs his eyes, sits back. max sits up, watching. on tv: masked man pulls the bound woman's head back by her hair, licks her face with his thick tongue... close on: masked man grips the woman's head, still licking. he pulls down the woman's blindfold... welles sits forward, realizing, horrified... welles goes to the vcr, hits pause. the image on tv freezes. welles goes back, frame by frame... ... to the close up where masked man grips the woman's face. freeze frame. on masked man's hand: a tattoo, on the arch between his forefinger and thumb, same as the scrawny masked man in the snuff film. a pentagram tattoo.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{who is he?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i told you, he's one of dino velvet's stock players...}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{who is he, his name?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{nobody knows his name. that's his thing. he always wears a mask. you never see his face. he calls himself "machine," that's what they call him. machine.}
<A>__{welles hits play. on tv, masked man runs his hands up and down the woman's body. the woman's eyes are filled with fear. welles sits, unnerved, watching.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{they say he's half brain dead from all the steroids he's using.}
<A>__{max rolls over, trying to get back to sleep.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{he's a brutal motherfucker, man. he loves what he does for a living.}
