<B>__{please try again.}
<A>__{back on hammond's quarters the raptor has chewed almost all the way through the bars. panic below. in the middle of it all, ellie is focused, listening on her headset. back on control room timmy tries somethin g else. beep. lex raises a hand. grant stops her.}

<B>__{systems normal.}
<A>__{back on hammond's quarters the raptor has just chewed through. he squeezes his body into the space as the bars electrify. spastically, the raptor jerks back and forth as the current flows through him. he can't get out. finally, with a whimper, he stops struggling and slides through the space he created. with a thump, he drops to the floor below. ellie, muldoon, hammond and the workers look on in shock. back on control room grant cheers and hugs timmy. lex whoops.}
<C>__{ellie }
<D>__{ok, we're all right here for now. thanks.}

<A>__{tim punches the screen which displays farrell, f rederick d. (capt.) grant reads it and nods. his voice is tough as nails.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{try this for identification, captain farrell. you are in possession of stolen biological materials. if you don't turn that boat around and return to isla nublar immediately with your contraband cargo, you will be found in violation of section 509 of the uniform maritime act, you will be subject to revocation of license, penalties in excess of fifty thousand dollars, and five years in jail. do you copy?}

<D>__{who the hell knows?}
<A>__{grant and timmy start to celebrate again when lex interrupts.}
