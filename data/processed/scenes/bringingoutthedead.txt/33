<A>__{noel has sliced up a tire and fastened the pieces with string over his shoulders. tin cans circle his wrists and ankles. one hand carries a broken bottle, the other a stringless violin. frank jumps back inside as noel rams the window, leaving stains from his blood matted dreadlocks. larry calls for backup: medics, police, firemen, anybody. the side window glass bends as noel rams his head against it. frank reaches for the short club between the seats; noel holds the jagged bottle to his neck.}
