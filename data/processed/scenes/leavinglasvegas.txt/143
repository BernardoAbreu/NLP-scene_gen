<A>__{sera is finishing in the shower and ben is sitting at the kitchen table. he gets up and walks around the house, trying to get a sense of her. the furniture is very plain and there is spartan quality about the hose. he looks with interest at the bookshelf, which has a good selection of literature.}

<C>__{ben}
<D>__{don't know. my watch went the way of the car.}
<A>__{he holds up his empty wrist for her to see. then looks up and sees her watching him.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm rambling. i really like you. you make me want to talk... i don't know what time it is.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{i like hearing you talk.}
<P>__{(businesslike)}
<D>__{if you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. all the food in vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. how does that sound to you?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{do they have drinks?}
