<L>__{interior corral club night}
<A>__{the place is crowded... jumping with activity. a local band is playing on a tiny stage. bb's on the floor dancing with a girl. he's doing some good moves, and it's obvious that he's a real crowd pleaser. sitting at the bar are looney, stanley and carly.}
<C>__{carly}
<D>__{the buzzard had a great gimmick. you know, when it came time to measure a job, he'd cut the yardstick and reglue it together ... he took out seven inches so his square footage would always be higher. that way he'd always make a few extra bucks on the job.}
<A>__{stanley laughs and looks at carly.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{you're kidding?}
<C>__{carly}
<D>__{yeah... he'd always put his hand over the break when he was measuring. nobody looks at a yardstick to see how long it is.}
<C>__{looney}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i never did that... i never did that... i was never very good in arts and crafts. i could never make the ruler come out right.}
<A>__{the song ends.}
<B>__{angle on bb}
<A>__{he pats his dancing partner on her rear, she walks back to her table, and bb walks over to where moe is sitting. bb picks up his beer can, holds it up to moe as if he's going to make a toast.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{here's to nora.}
<A>__{moe smiles, picks up his can, they tap their cans, and both take a swig of their beers.}
<B>__{angle on bar}
<A>__{stanley is really enjoying the stories carly and looney are telling.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{what else? give me another story ... these stories are great!}
<C>__{looney}
<D>__{just a minute... i've got one. you know it's like the faster you can start spiking a job, the guy can't back out of the deal.}
<C>__{looney }
<D>__{shoe had some customers that he thought was fragile on coming for the buy. he'd say to the guy 'here let me show you how bad a shape your house is in,' and he'd rip off a piece of wood, maybe fifteen feet wide. the guy's house looks like shit so it makes it hard for him to back out of the deal when half the side of his house is missing. the shoe's a fucking wonder.}
