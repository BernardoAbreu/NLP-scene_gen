<D>__{it's right around the corner.}
<A>__{an old man sits on his porch across the street.}
<C>__{the postman}
<P>__{(freezes, startled)}
<D>__{what is?}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{what you're looking for.}
<A>__{the old man winks knowingly, then heads inside. as the postman turns the corner, he finds himself in front of the post office. an old brick building. chiseled in the granite facing: "united states post office. est. 1884."}
