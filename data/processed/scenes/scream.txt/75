<L>__{interior garage}
<A>__{the kitchen door opens and light floods the darkened garage. tatum stands in the doorway searching for a light switch. she finds a button and hits it. brrrrmmm! the electric garage door starts to rise. wrong switch. she hits it again and it closes. she finds another switch. click. a small lightbulb overhead comes on, barely lighting the large two car garage, leaving pockets of shadows along the wall. tatum spots the refrigerator against a far wall and heads for it, not seeing the kitchen door, quietly, slowly, closing behind her, sealing her off from the rest of the house. tatum stumbles to the refrigerator and throws it open. its light casts a glow across her face. crash boom! tatum jumps, spinning around just in time to see a cat escape through a large pet door that's built into the garage door. she smiles at her jumpiness. tatum loads up with as many beer as her hands will carry and heads back to the kitchen. at the kitchen door, she juggles the beer, reaching for the knob. it's locked.}

<D>__{oh, shit piss!}
<A>__{tatum leans over and, with her elbow, hits the garage door button. brrrmm! it begins to rise. she moves towards the rising door, beer in hand. suddenly, crr brrrm! the garage door resets, reversing direction, moving down, closing.}

<A>__{tatum spins around to see..}
<B>__{a ghost masked figure}
<A>__{silhouetted in the dark, next to the kitchen door, his hand on the switch. tatum at once gasps, taken back, but then relaxes.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{is that you, randy? cute.}
<A>__{the figure stares at her, blankly.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{and what movie is this from? i spit on your garage.}
<A>__{tatum takes a step towards the figure.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{lose the mask. if sidney sees it, she'll flip.}
<A>__{the figure shakes his head slowly from side to side.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{oh, you wanna play psycho killer?}
<A>__{the figure slowly nods.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{can i be the helpless victim?}
<A>__{the figure slowly nods again.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{okay, let's see. "no, please don't kill me, mr. ghostface. i want to be in the sequel."}
<A>__{tatum takes a step to move around the figure, but he steps too, blocking her.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{cut, casper. that's a wrap.}
<A>__{tatum moves again, sidestepping the figure, but he's faster and cuts her off. tatum juggles the beer against her chest with one hand and with the other pushes the figure hard, knocking him aside.}

<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{you little shit.}
<A>__{tatum yanks hard, releasing his hold when a flash of silver catches her eye. she looks down, glimpsing a long sharp blade as it darts forward, cutting into her forearm... tatum pulls back, horrified, as the moment turns deadly serious. the figure advances on her knife out, ready. she staggers backwards, holding her bloody arm, backing into the refrigerator,}
<B>__{screaming.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{the figure lashes out with the knife. tatum dodges it, leaping back against the fridge. the figure advances. instinctively, she rips the top freezer door open, bashing the figure in the face, sending him backwards, reeling. tatum bolts to the...closed garage door. in a panic, she beats and pulls on it, trying to make it lift. she eyes the figure...he's recovering... she goes for the pet door, dropping to the floor, diving for it...she wedges her upper body through, her head, shoulders, torso just as the... figure pounces, grabbing hold of her feet. tatum goes crazy screaming and kicking trying to get through.}
