<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{after fifteen years in storage, the lemmons had developed a delayed fuse.}
<A>__{jordan's pov is hazy as he stares at his own reflection in the pay phone.}
<C>__{jordan }

<A>__{jordan's pov the phone gets further and further away.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{actually i'd discovered a new phase: the cerebral palsy phase.}
<A>__{bammm!! jordan hits the floor with a thud, crashed out on his back. from the dangling phone, we hear:}

<D>__{jordan! jordan! do not get behind the wheel! just tell me where you're at, i will send rocco!}
<A>__{jordan lolls his head toward the phone, tries to reach for it; he can't. he lays there for a while, then:}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{c'mon, stand up!}
<A>__{he rolls onto all fours, lifts a hand, topples over.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{okay, walking is off the list of options. all right, what else is there?}
<P>__{(a brainstorm)}

<A>__{slowly, jordan begins crawling like an infant to the top of the staircase.}
