<A>__{the boys stand on the mound. rocco walks a circle around it.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{so, how's things going?}
<A>__{the boys drop their heads.}
<C>__{rocco }
<D>__{yeah. i know. it's rough having your faith shaken.}
<A>__{the brothers have a pained expression.}
<C>__{rocco }
<D>__{but it happens to all of us.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know what's always tripped me out? how hundreds of years ago, a bunch of desperate gamblers in leaky ass ships, crossed the ocean blue. they had no clue what was on the other side of it. took real balls. but they sailed into infinity and made it all the way to the shores of the new fucking world...}
<P>__{(re: surroundings)}
<D>__{...and all they had was their faith. i'm always surprised how so many people miss the simple fact that faith...is the reason all of us are even here. you can't underestimate the power of it. shit, you were the ones that taught me that.}
<A>__{rocco looks to his left and right. secretly.}
<C>__{rocco }
<D>__{listen, your my boys so i'm gonna give you some inside. the sox are gonna do it again this year. the line in vegas is huge. put everything you got on it.}
<A>__{the boys look to each other. eyes wide.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{maybe we should.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{you're sure, roc? you know this?}
<A>__{rocco smiles.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{no...i just have faith. and for a second there, you almost did too. y'see, it's contagious. and if enough people catch it...look out, baby.}
<A>__{a roaring cheer arises, shaking the very foundations of the arena. the boys turn in awe. the stands are still empty.}
