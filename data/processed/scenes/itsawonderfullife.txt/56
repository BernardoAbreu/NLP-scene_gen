<B>__{back to shot george and mary}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{we can both hear. come here.}
<A>__{mary takes the telephone from george and holds it so that of necessity george's cheek is almost against hers. he is very conscious of her proximity.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{we're listening, sam.}
<C>__{sam's voice}

<C>__{sam's voice}
<D>__{well, dad's snapped up the idea. he's going to build a factory outside of rochester. how do you like that?}
<A>__{mary is watching george interestedly. george is very conscious of her, close to him.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{rochester? well, why rochester?}
<C>__{sam's voice}
<D>__{well, why not? can you think of anything better?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh, i don't know... why not right here? you remember that old tool and machinery works? you tell your father he can get that for a song. and all the labor he wants, too. half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.}

<C>__{sam's voice}
<D>__{well, now listen. i want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear? and george, i may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken down building and loan. this is the biggest thing since radio, and i'm letting you in on the ground floor. oh, mary... mary...}

<D>__{i'm here.}
<C>__{sam's voice}
<D>__{would you tell that guy i'm giving him the chance of a lifetime, you hear? the chance of a lifetime.}
<A>__{as mary listens, she turns to look at george, her lips almost on his lips.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{he says it's the chance of a lifetime.}
<A>__{george can stand it no longer. he drops the phone with a crash, grabs mary by the shoulders and shakes her. mary begins to cry.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(fiercely)}
<D>__{now you listen to me! i don't want any plastics! i don't want any ground floors, and i don't want to get married ever to anyone! you understand that? i want to do what i want to do. and you're... and you're...}
