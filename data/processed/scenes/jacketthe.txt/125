<L>__{interior starks' room, alpine grove, december 29th, 1992}
<A>__{starks is trying to see if the windows open through the bars covering them. it's especially hard with the i.v. still connected to one of his arms.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{at least it's some kind of bars we've got you behind.}
<A>__{starks turns, startled.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{hello, william. i understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. i would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{that's too bad.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{it is. but when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. they'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the new year.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{they make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{temporarily.}
<A>__{starks lights a cigarette and, with that gesture, adopts the unscrupulousness of a criminal so convincingly it bears little resemblance to his usual demeanor.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{makes it a little easier for me to get away with mine.}
<A>__{becker looks at starks seriously.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{and what's that?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{my business?}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{getting away with things. like whatever i may or may not have gotten away with officer harrison.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{you killed him?}
<A>__{starks simply delivers one slow nod.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{and wound up in a better cage. [beat] but i still want to make a deal.}
<A>__{becker looks understandably disgusted and starks proceeds with the calculation of someone who is guilty.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{see, the deluxe lab animal treatment i've been receiving well, i don't think it's worked. i woke up today and realized... [eerily lowering his voice] ...i don't think i'm cured. so really, what was the point? torture? i think that's still sort of illegal in some states though we'll have to check on vermont. and, how's this for the cherry on top: it seems my physician is a pill popping freak. [beat] last time i checked, that makes some pretty good copy for a lot of these news shows. [humbly, deftly] "i don't remember everything they did to me. i just remember the worst parts." i think i should be sitting down when i say it, don't you think?}
<A>__{it takes becker some seconds to swallow this.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{i think...i have to think about it.}
<A>__{becker cocks his head to one side as he does. then he slowly makes his way over to starks and leans in closer to him. starks instinctively raises his hand to his head prepared to be defensive if he has to be. if this is the moment when he's killed. but becker only yanks the i.v. angrily out of starks' arm, tearing his skin with it.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{i think your story needs a little fleshing out before it's ready to go.}
<A>__{becker turns to leave as starks bleeds onto the floor.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{i will say a prayer for you in church today, starks. maybe the gods can pick up where the medicine left off.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you sure you know where to find one?}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{i've managed to every sunday of my life. [beat] some of us are god fearing men, starks.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{and what does that mean?}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.}
<A>__{starks smirks at the hypocrisy he sees.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{becker, how do you sleep at night?}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{you in here. [beat] works like a drug.}
<A>__{becker leaves without looking back and starks closes his eyes, breathing a sigh of relief that it's over.}
