<L>__{interior space station. day}
<A>__{in an otherwise empty lounge, the astronauts clutch styrofoam coffee cups. beck stands nearby. through a large viewport behind them, stars glitter against the inky blackness.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{if this was a earthquake, as we're now assuming, there's usually an auditory component.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{but that energy pulse they picked up in new mexico...}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{electromagnetic emission. not uncommon with large scale geophysical phenomena.}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{causing this kind of damage? i don't buy it. we're missing something here.}
<A>__{mcconnell and woody exchange a glance... woody's right.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{luke must be in pretty bad shape if he hasn't blasted out of there in the earth return vehicle. that thing's designed so even one crew member could fly it back to earth.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{even if luke was in great shape, he couldn't get home. that energy pulse would've fried the erv's computers.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{other than the computers, how do we think the erv fared?}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{well, so far our modelling says it should be in pretty good shape.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{which means it's gonna be up to us to get new motherboards, drives, and software to mars. as fast as we can.}
<A>__{mcconnell looks at him, nods. they're on the same wavelength. but beck is more cautious.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{whoa, slow down. it's gonna take us weeks just to analyze this data.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{right, but meanwhile, we've gotta be working up a mission plan.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{luke needs us now.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{luke may already be dead. and even if he's not, it's doubtful he's going to be able to transmit again. so we wouldn't know whether it's safe to land until you were almost there.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{what about sima?}
<A>__{terri looks at phil sima?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{the saturn imaging probe. it's going to slingshot around mars on its way through the solar system. it could be retasked to take pictures, read radiation levels at mars one base camp.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{good idea phil. if sima tells us luke hasn't survived and it's not safe to land, we swing around mars and come right back home.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{yes. we can design the mission to have a free return capability. it's a long trip, but if you don't land it's the best option.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{we're getting ahead of ourselves. you're forgetting the bigger problem.}
<P>__{(they look at him)}
<D>__{the orbits are all wrong. our first decent launch window is almost eight months from now.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{but we can go earlier and get there faster if we reconfigure the payload for extra fuel. we've modelled that, ray. i've modelled it.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{on paper, yeah. but those stresses have never been tested in space.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{the ship can take it.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i wasn't thinking of just the ship.}
<A>__{a tense beat. again we sense the test of wills between these two tough minded men, once good friends.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{i know the protocols for a mars recovery mission better than anybody, because i helped design them. and i'm saying these guys can do it.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{he's right, ray. we've got a real shot.}
<A>__{a pause with beck weighing the odds. he looks at woody.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{give me an updated mission plan by 0800 tomorrow. then i will put it in the works.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{you'll have it by 0600.}
<A>__{he looks at woody, phil and terri, who are just as eager.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{let's get to work.}
<A>__{mcconnell exits followed by terri and phil, but as beck starts out, too, woody stops him.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{chief, could i have a word?}
<A>__{beck looks at him a moment, nods.}
<A>__{sequence from original script.}
