<P>__{(to daniel)}
<D>__{all right. reach in easy and put the gun on the floor.}
<A>__{daniel slowly grabs his gun and places it on the floor, then kicks it under the bed.}
<C>__{ellwood}
<D>__{i said put it on the floor, not kick it under the bed.}
<A>__{ellwood speaks to his cousin, speaking slowly and enunciating each word so he can read his lips.}
<C>__{ellwood}
<D>__{get that and add it to my inventory.}
<A>__{the black guy get on his hands and knees and starts looking for the gun under the bed. as he does daniel glances over at zero with a look. ellwood aims his gun at zero.}
<C>__{ellwood}
<D>__{i assume you're carrying too?}
<A>__{zero opens his coat and reveals his .9mm.}
<C>__{ellwood}
<D>__{okay, put it on the floor... and do not kick it under the fuckin' bed.}
<C>__{zero}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{he stares at ellwood calmly through dead, flat eyes.}
<C>__{ellwood}
<D>__{no? did you just say no? listen cowboy, if you're thinking about makin' a move, don't. nobody is that fast.}
<C>__{zero}
<D>__{zero is.}
<C>__{ellwood}
<D>__{who's zero?}
<C>__{lamar}
<D>__{he is.}
<A>__{ellwood is confused. daniel bolts to his left. ellwood's eyes leave lamar for a moment it's a moment too long. in a blur of movement zero has his gun out and fires one shot into ellwood's forehead. ellwood slumps down on the bed, dead. the black guy who has heard nothing continues searching under the bed. zero casually picks up the suitcase filled with guns and hands it to daniel. they walk out of the room. lamar stands there, stunned, then quickly runs after them. a beat. the black guy pops up with daniel's gun oblivious to what has transpired in the room.}
<C>__{black guy}
