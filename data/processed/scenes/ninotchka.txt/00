<T>__{fade in on:}
<B>__{an establishing shot of paris in the month of april}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<B>__{the luxurious lobby of the hotel clarence}
<A>__{camera moves to a close shot of the desk. in the background is a revolving door leading to the street. through the revolving door comes a strangely dressed individual, obviously one who doesn't belong in such surroundings. it is comrade buljanoff, a member of the russian board of trade. despite the spring climate of paris, he still wears his typical russian clothes, consisting of a coat with a fur collar, a fur cap, and heavy boots. buljanoff glances around the lobby, obviously over whelmed by its magnificence. the manager, puzzled by buljanoff's strange appearance, approaches him.}
<C>__{manager}
<P>__{(politely)}
<D>__{is there anything i can do for you, monsieur?}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{no, no.}
<A>__{he exits toward the street. the manager returns to his customary duties, when suddenly a second russian, similarly dressed, pushes his way through the door and gazes around. it is comrade iranoff. the manager, definitely mystified by now, approaches him.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{yes, monsieur?}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{just looking around.}
<A>__{iranoff exits. again the manager returns to his duties, when suddenly he sees that a third man, dressed in the same fashion, has appeared in the revolving door. it is comrade kopalski. kopalski doesn't leave the revolving door at all but as it turns, drinks in the whole spectacle of the lobby. the manager is by now dumfounded.}
<B>__{street in front of the hotel clarence}
<A>__{a taxi stands at the curb. buljanoff and iranoff are waiting beside it, iranoff holding a suitcase. kopalski, returning from the hotel, joins the group.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{comrades, why should we lie to each other? it's wonderful.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{let's be honest. have we anything like it in russia?}
<C>__{all three}
<P>__{(agreeing with him)}
<D>__{no, no, no.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{can you imagine what the beds would be in a hotel like that?}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{they tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? a maid comes in a french maid.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<P>__{(with a gleam in his eye)}
<D>__{comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<P>__{(stopping him)}
<D>__{just a minute just a minute i have nothing against the idea but i still say let's go back to the hotel terminus. moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{where is your courage, comrade buljanoff?}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{are you the buljanoff who fought on the barricades? and now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<P>__{(stepping back into the taxi)}
<D>__{i don't want to go to siberia.}
<A>__{iranoff and kopalski follow him reluctantly.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{i don't want to go to the hotel terminus.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{if lenin were alive he would say, "buljanoff, comrade, for once in your life you're in paris. don't be a fool. go in there and ring three times."}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{he wouldn't say that. what he would say is "buljanoff, you can't afford to live in a cheap hotel. doesn't the prestige of the bolsheviks mean anything to you? do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all? phooey, buljanoff!"}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<P>__{(weakening)}
<D>__{i still say our place is with the common people, but who am i to contradict lenin? let's go in.}
<A>__{all three start to leave the taxi, as we}
