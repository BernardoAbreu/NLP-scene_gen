<L>__{interior common room sunset}
<A>__{this was probably a stately parlor in its day. there is a funky assembly of odd handmade furniture. there are muslin curtains on the windows, crude paintings, and quilts covering ripped chairs and couches. despite the squalor, there is a neatness to the place. now, the camera begins to roam through the room and down the hallways lined with fading wallpaper.}
<C>__{voices}
<P>__{(various)}
<D>__{ where did she go...? ... was here a moment ago... cynthia, come on, honey, we need you... cynthia, come out, come out wherever you are... the sun's going down, we're losing the moment...!}
<C>__{voices}
<D>__{hey, mellow out, we got ten minutes, i like, checked the almanac, okay...? ready or not, here we come...}
<A>__{all these comments are made in relaxed and good natured tones. finally the camera pans over to a little storage alcove beneath the servant's stairway. a hand reaches in and opens the door, and inside we see cartons, antique toys... and then cynthia, a pretty 13 year old girl who wears funky clothing and a haunted, nervous expression.}
<C>__{voices }
<D>__{...there you are, you naughty girl! you almost made us lose the sunset... come on, honey, time's wasting...}
<A>__{she shrinks back from the hands that are pulling her up and out, but they prevail, and she's up and on unsteady feet. the camera stays with her as she's led back down the hallway.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(faintly)}
<D>__{no, please... i... i really don't want to do this... can't i just wait for you..? i i'm not sure about this }
<A>__{a set of hands moves in, separates cynthia from the others.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{revealing victor, a handsome youth a few years older than cynthia.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{easy, cyn, easy. you don't want to do this, that's okay... right, harris?}
<A>__{the voices stop as everyone awaits an answer. camera pans across the common room, to the end we haven't seen yet. in the center of the room is a big cistern or font. as we watch, harris has just dunked someone in it. the person steps out, laughing, sloshing in amber liquid. standing around are other people, some already dripping wet, others awaiting their turns. some are clothed and wet, others in varying degrees of undress. it all seems slightly off, slightly eerie, despite their smiles and cheer. harris splashes himself with the amber liquid from the tub, pushes his hair back.}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{no, victor, it's not okay. here at unity house, some things have to be done...}
<P>__{(slight smile)}
<D>__{...in unity. this is one of them.}
<A>__{he wades closer to the camera, within reach of cynthia, victor and the others. smiles again. it's the kind of a smile that inspires trust.}
<C>__{harris }
<D>__{cynthia, do you trust me?}
<A>__{she nods immediately.}
<C>__{harris }
<D>__{and have i ever lied to you?}
<A>__{she shakes her head. he gestures. the people around cynthia begin to get into the tub. some remove their clothing; others get in clothes and all. toddlers and infants are held by their parents and playfully splashed.}
<C>__{harris }
<D>__{then i say to you now... to all of you now... that this will be the ultimate joining... of man and woman... parent and child... humanity and godhead.}
<A>__{he looks at victor, who reluctantly lets cynthia's hand go, gets in. now only cynthia remains.}
<C>__{harris }
<D>__{cynthia. come. there is no shame in this. no crime. no sin. just the final break with the old world... as night falls, we start a new day... a day of unity.}
<P>__{(a command, but warm)}
<D>__{come to me... my lovechild.}
<B>__{on cynthia}
<A>__{his last words melt her remaining resistance. moving like a sleepwalker, she steps into the tub, wades forward. then she stops, looks down at the fluid lapping at her jeans... runs her hand through it. her eyes widen.}
