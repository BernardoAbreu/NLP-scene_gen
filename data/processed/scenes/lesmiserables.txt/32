<A>__{fantine makes her way to the harbour wall. beggars shelter in the tunnels under the red brick buildings.}
<L>__{exterior red light district, montreuil night}
<A>__{fantine makes her way down wet slimy steps. this leads to an alleyway that runs down to the harbour and three ships lying on the mud at low tide. at the far end, the largest is the rotting hulk of a vast old warship. a single whore sits in a doorway.}
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{excuse me, is this where the pawnbrokers is?}
<C>__{whore 1}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{it's just there.}

<C>__{sailor 1}
<D>__{i smell women! smell'em in the air! think i will drop my anchor in that harbour over there!}
<A>__{they spot fantine, mistaking her for a whore. fantine presses on down the steps, trying to ignore the sailors.}
<C>__{sailor 2}
<D>__{lovely ladies! love `em till your broke! seven months at sea can make you hungry for a poke!}
<A>__{the sailors then see whores start to appear from the shadows of warehouse doorways.}
<C>__{sailor 3}
<D>__{even stokers need a little stoke!}
<A>__{a man with no legs, reacting to the sailors, cranks up an organ grinder and from doorways and overhead windows harbour whores appear and tout for business. a man selling dentures stands by his cart and we hear fragments of his sales pitch.}

<A>__{during the above chorus, fantine sells a locket containing a cutting of cosette's hair to the pawnbroker.}
<C>__{pawnbroker}
<D>__{hello sweetheart, i will give you four francs.}
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{it's worth at least ten.}
<A>__{the pawnbroker goes back in his shop and fantine watches the whores.}
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{alright, five.}
<A>__{the pawnbroker takes the locket in exchange for the money. an old woman leers at fantine from the shadows, beckoning. she approaches fantine, reaching out to stroke her hair.}
<C>__{hair crone}
<D>__{what pretty hair! what pretty locks you've got there! what luck you got. it's worth a centime, my dear! i will take the lot!}

<D>__{it pays a debt...}
<C>__{hair crone}
<D>__{just think of that.}
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{what can i do? it pays a debt. ten francs may save my poor cosette.}
<A>__{the hair crone leads fantine down to her shop at the base of the stairs. fantine is sat on a low stool. she bows her head before the hair crone, who at once whips out a razor blade and cuts off her hair at the roots.}
