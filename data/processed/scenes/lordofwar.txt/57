<L>__{exterior st. barthelemy airport. day.}
<A>__{a limousine approaches a lear jet parked on the tarmac of the one runway airport. yuri and ava exit the car.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{i nearly went broke trying to convince her i was anything but. i knew ava was not the kind of woman to be seduced by a ride in a private jet unless you owned the jet.}
<A>__{close on the tail of the jet the name "orlov air".}
<C>__{ava}
<P>__{(holding her skirt in the wind to protect her modesty)}
<D>__{this is your plane?}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(shrug)}
<D>__{that is my name.}
<A>__{they enter the plane.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{of course i was lying. the plane was a rental, like the car and even the suit i was standing in. at the last minute, i bribed the crew for the paint job.}
<A>__{as the plane picks up speed on the runway, the name "orlov" smears.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{luckily, by the time we landed, ava wasn't looking anywhere but in my eyes.}
