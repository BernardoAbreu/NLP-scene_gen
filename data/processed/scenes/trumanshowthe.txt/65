<L>__{exterior lower manhattan street. morning.}
<A>__{truman exits the subway, still lost in thought. he stops at the newstand and picks up a copy of vanity fair to resume his ritual search but his heart is not in it. he starts his trek to work, pausing to stare at his reflection in the mirrored building, hoping that the homeless man will appear at his side once again. but no one joins him. however, as truman continues to stare, it is the building itself that takes his interest. an imposing forty story office building, a black, sheer mirrored box clad in the kind of reflective glass that shields its occupants from the world, a building truman passes every day. as usual, a steady stream of employees and visitors enter and exit the building's high ceilinged lobby past an intimidating security desk manned by two uniformed guards. beyond security are banks of elevators, ferrying executives, clerical staff and delivery personnel to and from their floors of business. truman abruptly enters the building. he strides confidently past the security desk trying to look as if he belongs.}

<D>__{can i help?}

<D>__{i have an appointment at, er...diamond enterprises.}
<C>__{security guard 1}
<D>__{they went bust.}
<A>__{the second security guard is rising from his seat to block truman's path to the elevators but truman reads his mind and makes a dash for it. he slips into an elevator just as the doors are closing, defeating the flailing arm of the pursuing guard. a woman executive in the elevator looks in horror at truman. the cause of her concern becomes all too apparent. looking beyond the woman, truman discovers that there is no back to the elevator car. the elevator is simply an opening into the body of the building. truman pushes past the woman to be confronted with the fact that the entire office block is nothing but a giant, empty shell with no floors above the ground floor. the people truman has just witnessed entering the other elevators are milling around a refreshment table, sitting on folding chairs, changing their clothes behind temporary curtained cubicles or lining up to re enter the bogus elevator cars. gradually, they all turn to gape at truman, who in turn stares back, appalled. the security guards suddenly appear at truman's side and take him by the arm.}

<C>__{security guard 1}
<D>__{we're re modelling.}

<D>__{like fuck! what're they doing?}
