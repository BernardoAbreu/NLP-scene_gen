He sees the birds heading towards her. He runs and leaps off a ROCK OUTCROPPING jumping right over the CROODS who are huddled near the ROCK. Guy lands and in one fluid motion knocking the horn out of Eep's hand to stop the noise then STRIKES a spark with two STONES. The birds close in, blotting out the remaining light. All goes BLACK. Then, a tiny leaf of flame FLUTTERS to life before Guy. He THROWS two more handfuls of grass on it, and it FLARES UP! The light SPLITS the onrushing red tide of birds like a knife.
