<L>__{exterior west wing driveway day}
<A>__{super: thursday, october 25th. day 10. the west wing looms behind kenny and bundy. kenny, poker faced, takes a drag on his cigarette. bundy nervously flicks his, looks away from kenny a beat.}
<C>__{bundy}
<D>__{what did you think of lippman's column this morning?}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{i think it's a bad idea.}
<A>__{bundy turns back to him.}
<C>__{bundy}
<D>__{thank god. look, everyone is furious about it. we trade away our missiles in turkey and we're fucked politically.}
<A>__{kenny grinds his jaw, but doesn't say anything. he agrees. bundy steps up to him, confiding.}
<C>__{bundy }
<D>__{you gotta stop 'em. we know it's jack and bobby's idea they leaked it to lippman. the military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{then they should speak up.}
<C>__{bundy}
<D>__{christ, ken, you know it's not that easy.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{yes it is.}
<C>__{bundy}
<D>__{no it isn't. they don't trust the people that feel this way. but these people are right. and the kennedys are wrong.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we need you to tell 'em, kenny. they'll listen to you.}
<A>__{kenny prickles, intense, but bundy presses on, too wrapped up in his own thinking to notice.}
<C>__{bundy }
<D>__{jack and bobby are good men. but it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to }
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{ you listen to me. nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. you're fucking here right now because of the kennedys. they may be wrong. they make mistakes. but they're not weak. the weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.}
<C>__{bundy}
<D>__{you know i don't mean they're weak.}
<A>__{kenny gets in his face, intimidating.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{no, they just lack 'moral toughness.' and you think i will play your judas. you wasps and blue bloods never understood us, thinking we want into your club. well we got our own club now.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and you guys don't realize fighting with each other is our way. nobody plays us off each other. and nobody ever gets between us...}
