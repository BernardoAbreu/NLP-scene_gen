<L>__{exterior garage liz brooks}
<A>__{a tall, attractive girl of twenty in dungarees and cotton shirt. she stands just outside the open barn like door of the garage, staring, from the compulsive force of habit, at the endlessly receding tracks. the sultry wind, its gustiness slightly increased, blows through her fine dark hair.}

<L>__{exterior porch of hotel coley trimble and hector david}
<A>__{two enormous men. hector is tall, and there is about him a nasty, raw boned tautness; coley is more the anthropoid type long thick arms and a round, iron casing of a belly. they glance down the street, watching incuriously a dust devil swirling in the wind. now the camera has completed its probe of the town and its denizens. main title and credits are completed... close shot mr. hastings still spineless in his chair, the chair still tilted against the shack. from o.s. and far away, we hear the horn of the streamliner two long "wonks", a short and a long (engine whistle signal for approach to bridge crossing). hastings straightens up ever so slightly as he reacts to the oncoming train. straight shot streamliner moving at tremendous speed.}
<B>__{bridge}
<A>__{with train barrelling toward it. the horn blasts three short wonks (engine whistle signal for stopping at next station). close shot hastings getting jerkily to his feet, as though charged by a galvanic current. the uncharacteristic speed of his movements throws the tilted chair to the station platform. he raises an arm to shield his watery eyes from the sun...}

<D>__{stopping...?}
<A>__{shot train heading toward camera, churning across the desert like a juggernaut. it pans past camera in a blur of speed. camera swings up on a level with the great iron wheels as the brakes are applied. the wheels shriek agonizingly against the rails, kicking up cinders and a wild flurry of dust. she cuts speed, brakes hissing, and starts to slow down. long shot main street black rock shooting from rear of town, toward the railroad tracks. the townspeople step out, frowning, cautious, disturbed. the secure ritual of the train passing through, never stopping, has somehow, for some unknown reason, been violated. close shot doc velie as his mouth tightens. his air of placidity vanishes, leaving his features disturbed. close shot liz brooks her fine young face stiffens almost imperceptibly. her eyes are coated with a vague emptiness. she seems confused as she halfturns toward the hotel. reverse shot what she sees coley trimble and hector david, standing on the porch of the hotel. they seem tense, responding variously to what might be fear. coley's nostrils flare, his flat ugly mouth compresses. he looks profoundly serious. hector wipes a glob of dusty sweat from the socket of an eye and blinks rapidly. close shot hastings as he stands in surprise, nervously alert, watching the train as it comes to a complete stop. his jaw droops with the slackness of fear.}
