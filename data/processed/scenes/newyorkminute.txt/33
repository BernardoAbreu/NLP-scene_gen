<L>__{interior the ritzy plaza}
<A>__{this looks like a good place to get your throat cut fighting over a dime's worth of crack. there's no real lobby, just a small area to stand at the "desk" which is behind iron bars. behind the iron bars a rabbit eared tv with a busted in tube houses a dead houseplant. an old easy chair leaks stuffing.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(swallowing)}
<D>__{hello? anybody?}
<A>__{above, a baby screeches. something breaks. then a disembodied voice speaks to them.}
<C>__{desk clerk }
<D>__{keep your pants on. what'dya want?}
<A>__{the girls look behind them, nobody. behind the bars? still nobody. what the hell?}
<C>__{desk clerk }
<D>__{i don't got all day.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(uh...)}
<D>__{we need a room... with a shower. just for an hour.}
<A>__{there's the sound of something scraping across the floor and then the midget hotel clerk appears behind the counter. now he's standing on a stool and we don't know what he was doing behind the counter.}
<C>__{desk clerk}
<D>__{sixty bucks.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(getting oriented)}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{desk clerk}
<D>__{you want the room or not?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{sixty dollars an hour for this }
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(interrupting; covering)}
<D>__{ really nice place. how much for half an hour.}
<C>__{desk clerk}
<D>__{maybe if you two were in school you could figure out that half a sixty is thirty.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{we've only got twenty five.}
<C>__{desk clerk}
<D>__{you think because i'm short you can just charm me into making some deal, is that it?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{no, not at all.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{it's all we have. twenty six dollars and thirty six cents.}
<C>__{desk clerk}
<D>__{are you the one that stinks so bad?}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(insulted)}
<D>__{i had a little accident, okay?}
<C>__{desk clerk}
<D>__{all right, all right, don't get your underwear in a bunch. as a public service, just 'cause you stink so bad, you can have it for twenty five.}
<A>__{he retrieves a key and holds it up just out of reach between the bars.}
<C>__{desk clerk}
<D>__{ten dollar deposit on key.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{what part of 'that is all the money we have' didn't make sense to you?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{sir, that's every last cent we have in the world. i swear to you, we aren't planning to steal your key.}
<C>__{desk clerk}
<D>__{i give you some special deal, the next thing you know, you two are telling everybody, hey, this midget was a real sap. we gave him some sob story and the little guy just busted up into crocodile tears and handed over the key.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i promise we won't tell anyone. will we, drew?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{not a word. girl scout's honor.}
<A>__{he grudgingly holds out the key for parker, who takes it and hands it to drew while she gets the money out. on drew sensing something, she looks down at her feet where a huge rat is licking the sweet stuff off her shoes. there's a rather long beat while this horror sinks in, then:}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{ahhhhhh!!!!}
<A>__{key in hand, drew makes a beeline out the door.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{drew?! drew?!}
<A>__{parker follows her.}
<C>__{desk clerk}
<D>__{come back with my key!}
<A>__{the desk clerk jumps off his stool, opens his cage and follows them into the street.}
