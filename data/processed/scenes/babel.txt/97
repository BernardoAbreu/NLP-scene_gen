<L>__{exterior yussef and ahmed's house day}
<D>__{ahmed and yussef run home. their mother and sisters are milking some goats into a tin bucket. when they fill, abdullah empties the milk out into a barrel.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{papa... papa... abdullah puts the bucket down on the floor and turns to look at his kids, who stop before him, panting, exhilarated.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{what happened? ahmed can barely control his gasping.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{the police... they're looking for you...}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{me? why?}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{no, they're not looking for you... they're looking for us...}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{you? why?}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{because of what happened to the tourist... yasira and her two daughters stop milking and approach. abdullah can't seem to understand what their talking about.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{what tourist?}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{the american... yussef killed her...}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{that's not true, we both did.}
<C>__{yasira}
<D>__{what are you saying? ahmed fires his words out.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{yussef started shooting at the cars because hassan said that the bullet could go really far...}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{that's a lie, you started shooting at the cars.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{yes, but you killed her. abdullah loses his patience and grabs ahmed by the shoulders.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{what the hell are you talking about? ahmed looks at his father straight in the eyes.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{yussef killed the american and he spies on zora naked and zora lets him watch her... abdullah turns toward zora. in his mind, everything is confusion.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{what is your brother talking about?}
<C>__{zora}
<D>__{that's bullshit.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{it's not bullshit; she's a whore and my brother spies on her... as soon as the words leave ahmed's mouth, yussef decks him and leaves him sprawled on the dust. ahmed shoots right back up and runs at yussef kicking, until they're both entangled in the fight and end up rolling on the ground. abdullah tries to get between them.}
