<L>__{interior coral lounge}
<A>__{a man in his late 30s: longish hair, no shave since the weekend, army jacket bulking over a massive frame. a daunting figure as he approaches the bartender.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{where is he?}
<A>__{bobby, the bartender, cocks his eye toward the restrooms.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior corridor coral lounge}
<A>__{lenny unlocks the men's room door and walks down the dingy corridor with her new customer, keith.}
<C>__{keith}
<D>__{yeah, i'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?}
<C>__{lenny}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{you nervous? forget it. the cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid trade, believe me }
<A>__{behind them, the door of the women's bathroom whips open and the guy in the army jacket grabs lenny from behind and slams him face first into the wall, jamming a .45 against his skull.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{don't move! that's it, assume the position you miserable techno perv puke.}
<A>__{cop style, the man in the army jacket kicks lenny's feet apart. starts to cuff him.}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(to keith)}
<D>__{beat it fuckwad.}
<A>__{ash white, keith lays a smoke trail down the hall. on the main floor of the club, fabrizio sees him splitting and hurries after him. back in the corridor, lenny spins around and shoves his attacker against the opposite wall. the guy offers no resistance. in fact, he's too weak from laughing.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{gotcha.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{damnit, max, i was with a client! you think that's funny? to mess with a man's livelihood? it's not funny!}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you see the look on that preppy puke's face? fuckin' pissed in his topsiders.}
<C>__{lenny}
<P>__{(laughing a little)}
<D>__{okay. it was funny. but it cost me money.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{come on, amigo, the world's full of marks. and nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal. you could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring! let me buy you a drink.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{least you can do.}
<A>__{max peltier, which he mispronounces "pelcher", slings his arm fraternally over lenny's shoulder. they cross to the bar. max roars greetings to several regulars, pushing between strangers like an out of control tractor.}
<C>__{regular}
<D>__{yo, pelcher! mad max!}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{fuckin' a right i'm mad! i might kill every man in here. but first i'm buyin' my buddy here a drink.}
<P>__{(seeing another regular)}
<D>__{hey o'neal! you were right, your wife does give good head.}
<A>__{max lurches onto a barstool and hunches there like a misanthropic bear, pounding the bartop.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{bobbyyyy! tequila por favor! double shots. make it tres generaciones, huh. nothin' but the best for my good friend lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad. hey, nice tie.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{thanks, max.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{d'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{this tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{that's not sayin' much.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{it's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.}
<A>__{max raises his double shooter.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{to the jungle! where outa the blue some shitbird can cap you in the back of the head and ruin your whole day.}
<A>__{he downs it in two fierce gulps.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{you were lucky, max.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{yup. so darn lucky. i wake up with a .22 short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension i can't live off of. good thing i wasn't any luckier. bobby! another shooter right here!}
<A>__{bobby pours for max.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you seen faith lately?}
<A>__{lenny reacts visibly to the name, his whole demeanor sagging.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{naw. she won't call me.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{just as well, lenny. you gotta get past it. i mean sure, faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, i mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{thanks, max. i'm touched by your concern.}
