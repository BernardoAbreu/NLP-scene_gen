<L>__{interior empty classroom day}
<A>__{j.d. moves to an empty row of desks. he turns the first desk as to face the second. heather duke warily lowers herself into the second desk as j.d. flops a manilla envelope onto it. heather duke opens the envelope and pulls out a stack of 8 by 10's. she gasps. the first shot shows a young heather duke in a summer camp uniform that vibrantly reads heather, she is holding one end of a large poster board drawing of two eskimos rubbing noses. holding the other end, in a summer camp uniform vibrantly reading martha, is a young martha dunnstock dumptruck.}

<D>__{what the.....}
<A>__{with a harsh laugh, she takes in the next photograph. it has young heather duke and young martha eating toasted marshmallows off each other's sticks.}

<P>__{(trying to stay clam)}
<D>__{where did you get these?}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{oh, i just had the nicest chat with ms. dumptruck. got along famously! it's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....would you care to see the canoeing shots?}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{what do you want from me?}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{strength. westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. heather chandler was that leader but...}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{but she couldn't handle it.}
<A>__{j.d. laughs. she's on the ball.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{i think you can. in catcher in the rye holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. he doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{very very. the photographs?}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{don't worry. i will ask you to do me a favor. you'll get the negatives and everything back then.}
<A>__{j.d. launches away from his desk with a grin. he places a red ribbon on heather duke's desk.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{in the meantime, strength, and hey, there's a little gift.}
