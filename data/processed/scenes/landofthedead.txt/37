<B>__{another scream.}
<C>__{knipp }
<D>__{oh, man. mister k. sure gonna be upset about this.}
<A>__{cholo drops his boxes and moves down the corridor.}
<C>__{knipp }
<D>__{i called security. they should be here...}
<A>__{cholo reaches the door to penthouse number two. it's locked. another scream from inside. he flings himself at the door. the latch splinters out of the frame. the door bursts open...}
<L>__{interior penthouse number two fiddler's green day}
<A>__{...and cholo enters a dark foyer. the only light comes from another room somewhere inside. a soft, rhythmic squeak, like a child's swing moving back and forth, echoes through the apartment. it's an eerie, incongruous sound. on guard, eyes straining, cholo moves inside. the squeak gets louder, the light brighter as he turns a corner and sees... ...a middle aged man, hanging dead from a homemade noose suspended from a light fixture in the kitchen! the body sways slowly, the harsh glare making the man's face even whiter than it is. a toppled chair lies on the floor at his feet. cholo stands transfixed for an instant. and in that instant... ...he is grabbed from behind! he whirls, ready to kill, but finds only a middle aged woman, 60 something, wearing a tailored suit and expensive jewelry, her perfectness blemished only by her hysteria.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{my johnny, he killed himself, he killed himself. my johnny! my johnny!}
<A>__{cholo shakes her, hard.}
<C>__{cholo}
<D>__{keep it together, lady.}
<A>__{behind them, in the kitchen, unseen, a dazed young man, walks up to the hanging corpse. he rights the toppled chair and steps on it, lifting a paring to knife cut through the noose.}
<C>__{young man}
<P>__{(softly, to himself) dad. oh, dad.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(to cholo) se security. are you}
<D>__{security?}
<C>__{cholo}
<D>__{no, i...}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{then, for god's sake, who are you?!}
<A>__{she resumes her screaming. in the kitchen, the young man is slicing through the rope when his dead father's eyes pop open! the young man is too busy with the rope to notice. the hanged man's eyes blink. once. twice. three times. its body twitches. and then... ...the hanged man turns, making a move on the young man. the motion increases the strain on the light fixture, which pulls away, sparking, from the ceiling and crashes to the floor, along with the hanged man and his son. the entire apartment is plunged into darkness. the woman stops her screaming. almost as soon as she does, a snarl can be heard from the kitchen, followed by another scream, this one coming from the young man. cholo rushes to a nearby fireplace and grabs a poker and a matchlight, which looks like a pistol, but shoots fire from its tip. he approaches the kitchen, using the flame to light his way. in the flickering glow, he sees... ...the young man lying on the floor. chunks have been bitten out of his neck and wrist. the body is convulsing in the last moments of life. the hanged man is nowhere to be seen. cholo stands over the young man and stabs him in the head with the poker, jabbing the point all the way through. the woman screams again from the kitchen doorway.}
<C>__{cholo}
<D>__{shut up! i gotta hear. where'd he go? where'd the other guy go?}
<A>__{silence. cholo pulls the poker out of the young man's head. shuffling sounds. he follows them to the other end of the kitchen, probing the darkness with his matchlight. the sounds are louder here. cholo lifts the poker, ready to strike. just as he does... ...the back door of the apartment bursts open and a security guard lunges into the kitchen, rifle in hand.}
<C>__{security guard}
<P>__{(to cholo) drop it!}
<A>__{cholo drops the poker and holds up his hands.}
<C>__{cholo}
<D>__{hey, no problem.}
<A>__{two more security guards come through the apartment's front door and rush into the kitchen.}
<C>__{cholo }
<D>__{no problem, no problem! but there is a problem. there's a dead guy walkin' around in here.}
<A>__{the hanged man appears without warning, attacking one of the guards who just entered, biting off half his left cheek, including the eye. before his partner can raise his gun, the woman grabs it from him! aims at the hanged man.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you selfish bastard! you left me alone here!}
<A>__{she fumbles with the weapon, not knowing how to make it work. the bitten security guard starts to lose all strength in his legs. the dead thing holds him up, as if waltzing with him, biting him again and again. cholo takes the gun from the woman and shoots the hanged man.}
<C>__{bitten security guard}
<D>__{i need help. i need help!}
<A>__{cholo kills the bitten security guard, too.}
<C>__{surviving security guard}
<D>__{you...fuck!}
<A>__{cholo turns the gun on the surviving security guard.}
