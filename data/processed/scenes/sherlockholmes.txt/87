<L>__{interior london jail morning}
<A>__{the next morning. a giant holding cell where every shade and aspect of victorian villainy is corralled. holmes wakes up on a bench after a peaceful night's sleep. watson sits next to him, exhausted, bloodshot eyes. he's reading his notebook, making the odd change here and there. holmes looks up and sees watson staring at him, shaking his head.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{i haven't slept all night. i deserve this... i clearly deserve it. how could i ever be so deluded as to believe i could meet mary's parents for tea once i let myself be talked into going with you. now of course i'm in jail.}
<A>__{holmes tries to wiggle his fingers which causes him enough pain that he decides to bind them with irene's handkerchief.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(theatrically indignant)}
<D>__{you're not implying that i am responsible for our current situation are you, watson? we were set upon, man, it was self defense.}
<A>__{watson shakes the notebook in holmes' face.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{i've used the time to review my notes on our exploits of the last seven months... and i've come to the conclusion that i must be suffering from to some profound psychological aberration.}
<C>__{watson }
<D>__{why else would i continually allow myself to be led into situations where you're deliberately withholding your intentions from me?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you've never complained about my methods before.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{i'm not complaining... i never complain... i never complain about your violin playing at three in the morning, your mess, your lack of hygiene, your stealing my clothes, your setting our home on fire!}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{that was an accident...}
<A>__{watson challenges him with a look.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{the first time was an accident...}
<C>__{big man }
<D>__{remember me, boys? put me away for robbery a few years back?}
<A>__{holmes turns and comes face to face with a dangerous looking man who has a few conspicuous warts on his face.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{ah, mr. brownlee. the fifteenth most dangerous man in london.}
<A>__{watson snaps at the man.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{who could forget that face? i told you, a little nitrate of silver and the warts will be gone in two weeks. now, if you'll excuse us!}
<A>__{brownlee takes a swing at watson. holmes checks him and drops brownlee without missing a beat.}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(to holmes)}
<D>__{nor am i complaining about the fact that you terrorize my patients and perform outlandish experiments on my dog.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{gladstone's my dog as well. it's in the interest of science.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{what i do take issue with is your ruthless campaign to sabotage my relationship with mary.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{watson, i completely understand now. you're overtired and feeling a bit sensitive.}
<A>__{watson now turns away, completely irritated at holmes' lack of understanding.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{what you need is a rest. you and i could go out to the countryside. my brother mycroft has a small estate near chichester. it has marvelous grounds and a beautiful folly. we could throw a lamb on the spit.}
<A>__{watson shakes his head in disbelief.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{if i were going to the country, i would be going with my future wife }
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{certainly. we should have her along. let's get gladstone out of the house as well.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{no, holmes. not you. me and her. you're not }
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{invited? now you're not making any sense, watson. why would i not be invited to my own brother's country home?}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you're not human. you don't get it, do you? you are this...}
<P>__{(touches his own head)}
<D>__{... without this.}
<A>__{he touches his own heart. they hear a billyclub hit the bars.}
<C>__{prison guard}
<D>__{john watson? you made bail.}
<A>__{watson steps up. holmes looks confused. he steps forward. but the guard shakes his head.}
<C>__{prison guard}
<D>__{just watson.}
<A>__{as he slides open the bars, they see... mary emerges from behind the guard. watson stands for a beat between holmes and mary. he must make a decision. and he does he leaves. holmes watches him walk out, then locks eyes with mary. she gives him a polite nod, turns, heads off with watson. the bars slide shut. the mob surrounds holmes. he's never looked more alone.}
