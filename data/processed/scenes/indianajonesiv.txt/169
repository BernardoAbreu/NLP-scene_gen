<A>__{the procession ascends a twisting stone staircase, that spirals upward, where the light becomes brighter... brighter... at the stairway top, there is another doorway. tyki and the others enter. indiana's body is carried through. the garden of immortal peaches! a breathtakingly beautiful forest of never ending luscious green trees, filled with succulent, ripe peaches. we have never seen colors like this. so magical...so intense... bright sunlight shines from a vivid blue sky. there is always a rainbow here. the procession enters. scraggy, clare, betsy and kezure stare in total wonderment. betsy is puzzled by the bright sunlight.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{but... it's... it's the middle of the night...}
<A>__{tyki whispers to scraggy, who explains to betsy.}
<C>__{scraggy}
<D>__{sun always shine in the garden of immortal peaches.}
<A>__{clare nods. kezure is mesmerized by the peach trees. his mouth hangs open. he turns to scraggy.}
<C>__{kezure}
<D>__{these are the peaches that make one ...forever young?...}
<A>__{scraggy nods. tyki leads the procession to a clearing in the garden. many freshly dug graves are here. all of the bodies are carried to separate graves, including indiana and bohbala. a few feet ahead of the graves, rests the largest peach tree in the forest. it is much wider and taller than the others. there is a small, glass encased tomb built into the tree. inside of the tomb, is a tiny skeleton. no more than four feet tall. the skeleton is adorned with a lion skinned robe and golden crown. in its hand, the skeleton clutches the famous golden hooped rod, a glorious, elaborate staff. an ancient inscription is etched in stone over the tomb. pointing to the inscription, clare turns to scraggy.}
<C>__{clare}
<D>__{what does it say?...}
<C>__{scraggy}
<P>__{(translating)}
<D>__{"our lord... our master... sun... wu... kung"}
<A>__{the sound track music rises. it is the tomb of the stone monkey king. clare exchanges an awe inspired glance with betsy, then looks to the still body of indiana.}
<C>__{clare}
<D>__{damn you, jones! why couldn't you be here to share this with me!}
<A>__{the pygmies begin to lower the dead bodies, including indiana and bohbala, into the ground. tyki reads from ancient scripture. scraggy sobs on the shoulder of kezure, who continues to stare in astonishment at the peach trees. suddenly, there is a rumbling sound. followed by a slight, tremor. the trees begin to sway, as a howling wind rushes through them. the tomb of sun wu kung glows with a bright light. the glass surrounding the tomb suddenly shatters. the skeleton's head turns. its body rattles. beginning to move. the skeleton steps out of the tomb. everyone stares in awe. terrified. the skeleton takes a few steps forward, stops, and raises its arms. high in the air. the skeleton opens its mouth. emitting a high pitched ...unearthly...screech! an ectoplasmic green smoke seeps from the skeleton's fingers, slowly traveling over the heads of the humans. the ectoplasm separates into several individual lines, that touch down upon each of the gorillas. the ectoplasm encircles each the gorilla's bodies. the gorillas begin to rise from the ground. high in the air. the ectoplasm appears to be carrying them toward sun wu kung. as the gorillas travel through the air, their bodies begin to shrink. growing}
<B>__{smaller. thinner.}
<A>__{the humans stare into the sky. watching the amazing, magical}
<B>__{transformation.}
<A>__{as the gorillas get closer to sun wu kung, their bodies have shrunken to tiny, hair like substances. when the gorillas arrive at the skeleton, they attach themselves to his body. we see that the shrunken gorillas are actually individual hairs on the skeleton's body. as the countless hairs converge, the skeleton begins to take shape...form... sun wu kung comes to life! he is unlike anyone or anything we have ever seen. half human. half honkey. his face is covered with wrinkles. his wide eyes are coal black. probing. warm. when he smiles, it is devilish, but incredibly charming. his movements are perky. quick. an extremely adorable little fellow. instantly lovable. but there is a strong, powerful presense about him. he is indeed, a heavenly figure. sun wu kung looks over the congregation. everyone falls to their knees. clare, betsy, scraggy and a reluctant kezure do the same. sun wu kung paces through the clearing. he looks into the many graves. he is distressed. troubled. his wrinkled face twists into furious expression. he raises his golden hooped rod to the sky. he screams. his old voice creaks and groans.}
<C>__{sun wu kung}
<D>__{we cannot bury these men!... this is a garden of life... not of death!...}
<A>__{betsy whispers to clare.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{why's he speakin' in english?}
<C>__{clare}
<D>__{he is a heavenly being. according to legend, when a heavenly being speaks, men of all countries can understand him. we hear him in english...the pygmies hear him in their language.}
<A>__{betsy nods. sun wu kung continues his heartfelt scream into the heavens.}
<C>__{sun wu kung}
<D>__{return their souls!... i demand it!... return their souls!}
<A>__{a few moments pass. then...a thick, white cloud eclipses the sun. a small hole in the cloud, allows one ray of sunlight to shine through. the ray shines down upon one particular peach tree. sun wu kung turns to that peach tree. he raises the golden hooped rod toward the tree. he begins to sing an unusual hymn. suddenly, several peaches magically fly from the trees. they congregate above the golden hooped rod. the peaches spin in midair. with quick movements of the rod, sun wu kung sends several peaches flying off screen. camera follows the magical peaches as they separate and fly into each grave. toward the bodies of the dead pygmies. each body is hit with an individual peach. when the peaches make contact with the dead bodies, there is a small, colorful explosion. a small fireworks display. the bodies erupt with a bright golden glow. a few moments pass. one of the bodies stirs. moves. the body sits up. gets to its feet. another body does the same. so does another. and another. soon, the various pygmies climb out of the graves. their wounds have disappeared. their life has been restored. sun wu kung flings the remaining two peaches into the graves of indiana and bohbala. there is a small explosion...followed by the warm glow of their bodies. the wound in indy's chest vanishes. his eyes pop open. to the delight of his friends, indy stands. alive. he is puzzlled by the surrounding grave. clare, scraggy and betsy help indiana out of the grave. they shower him with embraces and kisses. but indy remains confused. puzzled.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{what the hell's goin' on?}
<A>__{sun wu kung, looking very pleased with himself, stands behind indiana. clare smiles at indy.}
<C>__{clare}
<D>__{i think there is someone you should meet...}
<A>__{clare points to behind indy, who turns and sees the smiling sun wu kung. indy is at first shocked... his face breaks into a childlike smile...filled with delight. he then manages to utter...}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{you... you're... sun wu kung?...}
<A>__{sun wu kung steps forward. he nods and answers.}
<C>__{sun wu kung}
<D>__{you are... indiana jones?...}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{huh?... you know me?}
<C>__{sun wu kung}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{i have watched you for many, many years...from the heavens. i was fascinated by your bravery...your passion...in searching for me.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{well, i... thanks i'm very honored.}
<C>__{sun wu kung}
<D>__{the honor is mine, doctor jones. you and your friends have saved my city from ruin.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{i would like to return the favor.}
<A>__{sun wu kung gives indiana the golden hooped rod. indiana takes the priceless artifact. he stares at the beautiful rod. he is very moved. speechless. sun wu kung explains. raises an eyebrow.}
<C>__{sun wu kung}
<D>__{the golden hooped rod will be a faithful friend. it is capable of one hundred transformations...and will always remain by your side.}
<A>__{indy manages a nod. sun wu kung sighs.}
<C>__{sun wu kung}
<D>__{i will explore the heavens for another. surely, my search will be shorter and less hazardous than yours!}
<A>__{indiana smiles. meanwhile, kezure uses the oppurtunity to sneak away. he disappears into a cluster of peach trees. he climbs the smallest tree. the greedy pirate king begins to pick several peaches. hiding them in his pockets. sun wu kung looks over the healthy, restored community of pygmies. the monkey king smiles.}
<C>__{sun wu kung}
<D>__{with my city alive again...i will be able to return to the heavens.}
<P>__{(warm smile to indy and the others)}
<D>__{goodbye...my dear friends.}
<A>__{sun wu kung again raises his arms. green ecotplasm again emanates from his fingers. the individual strands of hair fly from his body. in a reversal of what we saw only moments ago, the strands of hair fly through the air. they grow larger...larger...until they resume the shape of the gorillas. sun wu kung has returned to his skeletal form. he turns and walks back to his resting place. the pieces of broken glass re assemble. sealing the tomb. kezure, his pockets stuffed with peaches, hurriedly rejoins the others. tyki embraces bohbala, glad to have his father alive. bohbala, resuming his position as ruler, leads his people out of the garden. indiana, clutching his golden hooped prize, exits with the others.}
