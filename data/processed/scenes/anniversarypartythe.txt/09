<D>__{interior foyer front door continuous}
<A>__{joe holds evie in one arm. jack stands beside him, holds his hand. monica and ryan rose face him across the threshold the next door neighbors. she's in her late twenties and beautiful, eyes everywhere star struck and house struck. ryan is somewhat older, a little awkward in company, swallowing resentment and a little self righteous.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well, hello you two.}
<P>__{(putting evie down; to jack)}
<D>__{these are the people who live next door. say hello.}
<A>__{jack does.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{and close the door, jack. because if we leave it open, otis will run out and you know what will happen then?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{uh, uh.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{he'll run next door into their backyard and he'll bark and bark and bark and eat their pitbull for his dinner. is it a pitbull?}
<C>__{ryan}
<P>__{(not amused)}
<D>__{no, actually.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{oh whatever. we don't want that to happen, do we?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{it's a rottweiler, actually.}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{i don't think our rottweiler is in any danger, jack.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well, jack and i are very relieved.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i thought this was a party. are we going to talk about the dog thing?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{please, ryan.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(kisses her cheek and shakes his hand)}
<D>__{no, he's absolutely right. you're absolutely right, ryan. dog talk must be banned. canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us. can i get you a drink?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{not for me, thanks.}
<A>__{an awkward moment.}
<C>__{monica}
<P>__{(checks with ryan)}
<D>__{something soft.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{right away. are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, ryan?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i'm sure, yes.}
<A>__{sally has watched some of this from the archway, joins them super friendly.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{hi. monica and ryan?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{sally?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{yes. and you've met joe.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(a deep breath)}
<D>__{well, so glad you decided to come.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{we could hardly say no.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{oh?}
<A>__{joe slips the coke into monica's hand.}
<C>__{sally }
<P>__{(takes the gift)}
<D>__{thank you. this was so unnecessary. i hope you've noticed that otis isn't barking as much. we keep him in at night.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{at 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes. i have it on tape.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{you're keeping a record, are you?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{it's just very distracting when you're trying to work.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{ryan.}
<C>__{ryan}
<P>__{(to joe)}
<D>__{i'm sure you understand.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always otis.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{well today it was otis. and you should keep him away from our yard. because sheila will defend herself.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{ryan!}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(cuts off response from joe; to ryan)}
<D>__{are you working on a new book?}
<C>__{ryan}
<P>__{(caught short; flattered)}
<D>__{well, yes, actually.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{he always has two or three going...}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{really? joe can't manage more than one at a time. with huge gaps in between.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{mac and clair forsythe wave from the door. clair's arms are full of presents. mac carries three video cameras under his arm. he's got otis by the collar.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you lose this?}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(re: otis)}
<D>__{ah there's our snookums now.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{yes, well, but i haven't won a booker either. or the whitebread.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{the gate was open.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{well, not yet.}
<P>__{(she reacts to mac)}
<D>__{the gate was open?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{it's taken care of.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i think ryan needs a new publisher. i think he's outgrown him. they're just not doing their job.}
<A>__{a silence. awkward smiles go all around.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{hors d'oeuvres or something?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{yes, great! it's a beautiful house.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{thank you. i understand you're an interior decorator.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i so wish i'd known.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{well, whoever did this is amazing.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i did it.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(comes on them with the forsythes in tow)}
<D>__{she rarely cops to it.}
<P>__{(kisses sally's cheek)}
<D>__{otis is home.}
<C>__{clair}
<P>__{(re: the gifts)}
<D>__{where can i put these?}
<A>__{sally takes the gifts from her.}
<C>__{clair }
<D>__{what a fucking day! we only just got a sitter. i don't know her from fucking adam. she could be a serial killer. i'm going to have to call every ten minutes. you have to let me give out the number.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{she already has.}
<C>__{clair}
<D>__{it's alright, isn't it?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{of course it's alright.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{clair is a hovering mother.}
<C>__{clair}
<D>__{i'm not.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{this is monica and ryan. mac and clair.}
<A>__{clair takes a glass of champagne off the tray as they make their way down the hall.}
<C>__{clair}
<P>__{(a wide professionally ingratiating smile)}
<D>__{so nice...}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{and for us... truly.}
<C>__{clair}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{you will never know.}
<C>__{clair}
<P>__{(pleased)}
<D>__{oh.}
<P>__{(to sally)}
<D>__{i have a four thirty call. am. so we may have to leave early.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{why didn't you bring him?}
<C>__{clair}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{why didn't you bring him?}
<C>__{clair}
<P>__{(searches)}
<D>__{he's allergic.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{clair}
<D>__{to dander. otis.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{clair}
<D>__{didn't i say?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{well, probably.}
<C>__{clair}
<D>__{they can tell from the eyelashes, you know? he's got eyelashes yay long. they must be a foot long. the older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(muted)}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{the roses are happy to stand there on the fringe. next to someone they've only seen on screen and magazine covers. clair's not in the least put off by them. she manages to smile at them inclusively from time to time.}
<C>__{clair}
<D>__{so they tell me. not soon enough, of course.}
<P>__{(kisses her cheek)}
<D>__{how are you, sal? you look fantastic. it changes your life, you know. a baby. it puts everything in perspective, doesn't it. doesn't it, mac? you can't be the center of your own world, anymore.}
<C>__{mac}
<P>__{(as grounded as clair isn't)}
<D>__{it's an object lesson in grace.}
<P>__{(on seeing cal gold on the back porch)}
<D>__{wow! look who's here before me! my leading man is on time for once.}
<C>__{cal}
<P>__{(at the piano)}
<D>__{those who can't direct.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{fuck you.}
