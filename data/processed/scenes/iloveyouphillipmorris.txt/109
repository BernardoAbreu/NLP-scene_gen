<D>__{actually i was in the yard once. another guard asked him to pay him back five. he opened his wallet and i saw this picture of a little girl about steffie's age. so i brought it up to him once, just to get him talking. that's the thing about having kids, you know? gets people talking. shared experience. builds bridges. something i learned. anyway he tells me he's worried about her mamma was gone. we talked awhile. you know, i just listened. that's all. i brought up the candles just one time but mostly just listened... and the next day, bedtime, there they were.}
