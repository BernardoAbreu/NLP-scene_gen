<D>__{alright my little warriors, remain calm; trust that the ball will find you; remember they're your opponent not your enemies not kick major butt!}
<A>__{in the bleachers, jackie sits alone with rachel. they are having a coaching session of their own. rachel points down to the field, where... ...annabelle pushes her hair over her eyes.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{she's gonna trip over her own feet, if she doesn't get her hair out of her eyes.}
<A>__{jackie casts a sidelong glance at rachel. decides to tell her...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{pushing her hair over her eyes. means she's avoiding a confrontation.}
<A>__{rachel looks over. really? jackie decides to share more. reading rachel's reaction to...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{if she's twirling it, she's playing something out in her mind. if she's stopped combing it, she might be depressed...}
<A>__{as rachel listens she's unconsciously twisting her hair.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what about obsessively picking her split ends?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{anxiety.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{last week when she chopped her barbie's bangs all to hell }
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{she was angry at herself.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{jackie?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{when i twisted hair like this it means i'm intimidated by you...}
<A>__{jackie gives her the trace of a smile.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i will keep it in mind, and use it against you.}
<A>__{she looks back down at the game. rachel watching her profile. finally...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you feeling all right?}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(doesn't turn)}
<D>__{not great. plus, i've got things on my mind. you know.}
<A>__{things. rachel doesn't know. blurts...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{are you...seeing someone?}
<A>__{jackie snorts a laugh. in spite of herself.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{yeh, that does tend to make me sick to my stomach. actually, i'm, uh...}
<A>__{thinking. deciding if this is the time to say...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{...thinking of going back to random house. on a part time basis.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{wowie. how wonderful!}
<A>__{but jackie still hasn't turned. eyes glued to annabelle, racing around with determination.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{well, i could do most of it from home. but, while i'm working it out with the head editor, i'd need to...}
<A>__{sighs. boy, this is tough. tries for matter of fact...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{...make some trips into the city. sometimes, overnight.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{hey, any help you need, we'll cover.}
<A>__{jackie nods. appreciates that. but she still hasn't turned to look rachel in the eye.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{uh. have you told luke and the ki...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{let's...hold up for a bit. it may not happen. our secret, okay?}
<A>__{a little strange. particularly the hardness of jackie's eyes. rachel watching her. something's up.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{sure, if you like.}
<A>__{jackie looks away now. to the playground just beyond the bleachers. kids rise swings, clamber over a jungle gym. but her eyes are routinely, automatically, zeroing in on one single kid... ...who is climbing his way up a tall slide. crouched over as he inches up the shiny metal surface, using the side rails. rachel follows jackie's eyes, just as... ...ben reaches the top and stands up, hands over his head, jackie's breath catching, ben totters once and... ...falls fast, hitting the grass with a thump we can hear, lying crumpled, motionless, as our two women... ...spring up as one, scrambling down the bleachers, running toward the playground, jackie initially in the lead, but rachel out sprints her, closing on the child, as he rolls over grasping his leg, and reaching him first... ...some instinct makes her hold back, let jackie rush past her, to kneel at ben's side. she lifts her baby in her arms. his pants are torn, his leg is bleeding. his own concern...}
