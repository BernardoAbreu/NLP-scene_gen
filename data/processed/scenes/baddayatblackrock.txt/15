<A>__{as macreedy walks down hotel steps, a station wagon pulls up just before him. tied with a rope to the right front fender is a magnificent eight point buck. a stain of dry blood weaves an uneven course down his glossy flank from an unmistakable bullet hole in his shoulder. two men get out of the car; one of them is coley trimble. he sees macreedy coming toward him. he stands motionless in the center of the narrow pavement, picking at his nose with the detachment of a child. the other man is broad and excessively masculine as he swings out from behind the wheel. he walks around the car, joining coley at the curb. macreedy comes on. the man with coley looks at the stranger with colossal indifference, as expressionless as the soil of black rock. his handsome face, under a dusty hunting cap, is taut and hard and wind shaven. next to coley he stands motionless, except for the wisp of smoke from a black cuban cigarette between his thin lips. in b.g., the loafers who had been ensconced in the hotel lobby move out the door and stand on the porch. they watch macreedy, coley and reno smith, the handsome, taut faced man. silence soems to settle over everything. it is macreedy who breaks it...}

<A>__{gently he walks around coley and reno smith and continues down the street. coley's eyes follow him. smith goes up the steps of the hotel and enters the lobby. coley quickly follows him. the loafers on the porch go back inside.}
