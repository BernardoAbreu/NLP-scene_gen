<L>__{interior big meeting room night}
<A>__{alice races to the coffee table, looking for bill's machete. it is not there.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{the knife!}
<A>__{she gets down on her hands and knees to look for it. low angle: as she scrabbles on all fours. nothing under the couch. alice gets back up and rushes to the ping pong table to get the lamp. just as she reaches the table which is more or less against a window a figure swings, pendulum like, into the glass, shattering the pane in the window opposite alice. it is brenda, long since dead, dripping wet, white faced. alice sees her, turns and runs as fast as she can for the front door. alice flings open the wooden door and runs into a rain suited figure. alice screams. the figure holds alice in a strong grasp. when alice focuses, she sees a kindly woman in her early forties. she is strong, fairly tall, and very nice looking. this is mrs. voorhees. she wants alice to stop shrieking long enough to tell her what the matter is. alice sobs incoherently, pointing back to the rear window.}
<C>__{mrs. voorhees}
<D>__{there now, my dear. please. i can't help you if you can't talk to me. there, there now...}
<A>__{alice allows the woman to lead her back into the room. mrs. voorhees leads alice to the couch. in the bg we can see the broken window, but brenda is not visible.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{he's dead... she's dead... all dead... please save me... oh... poor bill... oh my god, oh my god... oh god...}
<C>__{mrs. voorhees}
<D>__{it will be all right. i will take care of you.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{jack? marcie? ned?}
<A>__{mrs. voorhees comforts her with a strong arm.}
<C>__{mrs. voorhees}
<D>__{it's just this place. the storm. that's why you're all upset.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{no, no, they're all dead...}
<A>__{alice points over her shoulder towards the ping pong table without looking. mrs. voorhees looks, shrugs.}
<C>__{mrs. voorhees}
<D>__{i will go look.}
<A>__{alice's face registers the new terror.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{they'll kill you! don't leave me!}
<A>__{mrs. voorhees smiles warmly.}
<C>__{mrs. voorhees}
<D>__{i'm not afraid.}
<A>__{alice waits by the couch as mrs. voorhees crosses the room to the back window.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{all dead? neddy? oh, marcie...}
<A>__{alice stands close to the fireplace. mrs. voorhees reaches the window and looks out. brenda's body sways just out of reach. mrs. voorhees is shocked.}
<C>__{mrs. voorhees}
<D>__{oh, my lord...}
<A>__{mrs. voorhees turns back and, as she passes the ping pong table, she picks up the lantern. alice waits at the fireplace.}
<C>__{mrs. voorhees}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{so young, so pretty. what monster could have done such a thing?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{bill bill bill is out there...}
<A>__{she lets mrs. voorhees take her in her arms.}
<C>__{mrs. voorhees}
<D>__{we shall go straight to the police.}
<A>__{alice backs up.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{the killer is still out there.}
<C>__{mrs. voorhees}
<D>__{i will protect you.}
<A>__{mrs. voorhees looks around the room.}
<C>__{mrs. voorhees}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{oh, this place... it should never have been a camp. not for children. they had so much trouble here.}
<A>__{the fire glimmers slightly in the fireplace. a log burns through and rolls off, throwing up a small shower of sparks.}
<C>__{mrs. voorhees}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{camp blood.}
<A>__{mrs. voorhees has almost completely calmed the girl down. strokes her soft hair.}
<C>__{mrs. voorhees}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you know a boy drowned the year before those two others were killed? an accident? it was inadequate supervision. the counsellors were not paying enough attention... they were making love when that boy drowned.}
<A>__{alice looks up as the woman strokes her hair. another angle: mcu as the older woman's hand strokes the younger woman's hair. the hand is missing its little finger! the theme enters upon the track in a lyrical, child like version, echoing back to another era, pretty and light.}
<C>__{mrs. voorhees}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{we should go now.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{maybe we should wait for mr. christy.}
<A>__{mrs. voorhees shakes her head gently.}
<C>__{mrs. voorhees}
<D>__{no. that won't be necessary.}
<A>__{as she speaks, mrs. voorhees reaches into her slicker in a surreptitious manner and very slowly slips out a long hunting knife.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<A>__{mixed on the track, filtered, echoed and distant, is the sound of a ten year old boy, jason, crying for help in a fantasy version of what might have happened when he drowned in 1957.}
<C>__{jason }
<P>__{(filtered)}
<D>__{help me, mommy... save me... please, mommy... please, mommy... help me, mommy... save me....}
<C>__{mrs. voorhees}
<P>__{(cocking her hand to listen)}
<D>__{i am, jason. i am.}
<C>__{alice}
<P>__{(a little confused)}
<D>__{why shouldn't we wait for mr. christy?}
<A>__{mrs. voorhees has gone through some subtle changes. while her voice remains warm and comforting, her face has started to slip into her other manifestation. all of this is in concert with the visibility of her weapon.}
<C>__{mrs. voorhees}
<D>__{it was my son they killed. they said he drowned, but i know it was inadequate supervision...}
<A>__{alice starts to become increasingly anxious. she can't see the knife rise behind her.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{mr. christy will be back soon.}
<A>__{mrs. voorhees shakes her head from side to side.}
<C>__{mrs. voorhees}
<D>__{no, he won't. i killed him as well....}
<A>__{the shock of recognition hits alice. in cu her eyes look up and see the knife which mrs. voorhees now has poised and ready to strike. alice bolts off the couch and stumbles backwards into the fireplace, scattering ashes and sparks. mrs. voorhees stands and steps forward.}
<C>__{mrs. voorhees}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i couldn't let them start this camp again, could i?}
<A>__{alice, in panic, looks for an escape. she grabs the fireplace poker.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{i won't let you!}
<A>__{alice swings the poker back and forth.}
<C>__{alice}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{no! no! no!}
<A>__{mrs. voorhees raises her arm to slash downward with the knife. alice swings the poker hard to mrs. voorhees' other arm and rib cage. mrs. voorhees is in pain, her face a mask of rage. alice drops the poker to run for the door. mrs. voorhees hesitates for a moment, then follows alice deliberately. lightning goes off followed quickly by thunder.}
