<L>__{interior lt. garber's office day}
<A>__{garber is sitting behind his desk as clifford walks in.}
<C>__{garber}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{any luck?}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{i've come to say goodbye, and thank you.}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{you found him?}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{where?}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{from here on, i go it alone.}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{what's the point of chancing it, cliff? we'll let you take the credit.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{pause. clifford sits down.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{i'm going to kill him, charlie.}
<A>__{garber leans forward in his chair and stares at clifford. a long moment passes. a button on the lieutenant's phone lights up and the intercom buzzes. garber doesn't even look down at it. the button flashes on and off, on and off. finally it stops.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{the closer i get to this guy, the more i... it gets to me. i don't know...}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{i think you'd better go on home, cliff. you've fallen in.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{no. not this time. this is the case that makes up for a whole career. if you can't understand it now, you will in a few years.}
<A>__{pause. garber considers another tack and follows it.}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{what part does money play in all this? play straight with me.}
<A>__{clifford is stunned by the question, but he tries to be casual.}
<C>__{clifford}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{for what i'm being paid, it's not out of line.}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{who's hired you for this?}
<A>__{clifford glares at his friend and doesn't answer.}
<C>__{garber}
<P>__{(cynically)}
<D>__{so you're a hitman now.}
<C>__{clifford}
<P>__{(passionately)}
<D>__{he murdered two kids in cold blood. you were there, too.}
<A>__{garber doesn't have to be reminded of his own feelings. he doesn't pursue the argument.}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{you could get busted.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{i understand that.}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{what are you going to use?}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{jimmy needles.}
<A>__{garber nods slowly, considering it a good choice of weapons at least.}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{you're stretching our friendship, cliff. if you blow this at all }
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{you'll never hear from me again.}
<A>__{garber looks away for a moment. when he looks back, he just shrugs his shoulders, "washes his hands".}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{take your time. do it right.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{don't worry.}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{do you need any help preparing for this thing?}
<C>__{clifford}
<P>__{(standing up)}
<D>__{i'm ready. i'm just trying to think where he could be in the meantime.}
