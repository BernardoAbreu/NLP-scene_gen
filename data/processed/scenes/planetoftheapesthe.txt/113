<A>__{the hunting party has reassembled here beneath the fruit trees. some of the gorillas have dismounted; others are still on horseback. in the middle distance is a crude horse drawn wagon. the sides and top of the wagon form a wire cage. three captive males and one female are visible within the cage. dodge and landon are nowhere to be seen. two gorilla porters enter scene, dragging a male human corpse by the ankles, as two other bearers enter scene with a living burden on a long carrying pole. taylor dangles from the pole, held aloft by the bonds around his wrists and ankles. camera pans with the two gorillas as they dump taylor into the wagon and close the tail gate.}
