<L>__{interior the cockpit continuous day}
<A>__{looking through the windshield, we see the creature is directly in the path of the plane. nash pulls back on the stick. the plane rises. the left propeller clips the flank of the enormous dinosaur, snapping the blade. blood sprays the windshield and side windows.}

<A>__{the turboprop banks into the jungle, out of control.}
<L>__{interior plane continuous day}
<A>__{the passengers are thrown about as the craft crashes through trees, tearing off a wing and pieces of the tail. finally coming to rest in the jungle canopy, the plane settles in the trees.}
<B>__{silence.}
<A>__{the passengers slowly recover and have a look around. foliage blocks most windows, making it impossible to see out.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{is anyone hurt?}
<A>__{checking themselves, everyone seems pretty much intact. still thinking of himself as in charge...}
<C>__{udesky}
<D>__{quiet! we're okay. let's everybody just stay put.}
<A>__{he attempts to turn on the cockpit radio, but it's dead.}
<C>__{nash}
<D>__{who's got the sat phone?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{right here!}
<A>__{paul hands the bulky phone up to nash, who dials out. grant unstraps himself, climbs to the back to the side door and shoves. the door opens a few inches before hitting a branch. he looks out the and lets out a quiet gasp as the ground reels}
<B>__{thirty feet below.}
<A>__{he quickly shuts and latches the door. close on the sat phone. pressed against nash's ear.}
<C>__{recorded voice}
<D>__{we're sorry. all circuits are busy. please try your call again later...}
<C>__{nash}
<D>__{shit!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what is it? what's the matter?}
<A>__{amanda screams. a huge reptilian face appears in the cockpit window. everyone else screams now. the plane lurches and we hear a deep growl. the passengers hold tight, paralyzed. nash buckles himself into his seat. suddenly, the plane is yanked from the side to side. battered this way and that, the terrified passengers tightly grip their seats. finally, the horrible sounds of wrenching metal as the nose of the plane is ripped right off. nash and udesky are suddenly sitting in open air. the nose of the plane is tilting downwards, the jungle floor far below. the passengers hang almost vertically in their seats, debris tumbles out the open end of the plane, some of it striking nash in the head. udesky unbuckles his seat belt and climbs back up into the cabin. nash follows. suddenly, a long snout with dagger like teeth pushes past the cockpit seats, opens wide, and}
<B>__{clamps down}
<A>__{on nash's legs. the pilot cries out in agony. the others passengers grab onto his arms, trying to pull him back. but it's no use. the dinosaur rips nash out of their grasp and down the aisle. nash desperately grabs on to the seat cushion, then watches in horror as the fabric rips away. he's pulled out of the plane and dropped to the ground. a giant foot steps in the way as the snout of the creature reaches down and quickly devourers the screaming pilot. it's horrifying sight, but no one can turn away. pleased with the appetizer, the creature comes back for the main course. grant tries to force open the jammed rear door. billy tries to help, but the door won't budge. the dinosaur jams its snout into the fuselage and lunges for amanda in the first row. she yanks her legs back as the jaws}
<B>__{snap shut.}
<A>__{behind amanda, billy reaches forward, unsnaps her seat belt and pulls her into the next row back. the others unstrap their belts and crowd into the rear of the passenger compartment. the shift in weight sends the fuselage tipping backwards.}
