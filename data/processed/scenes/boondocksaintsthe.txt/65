<A>__{the bodies have been removed and chalk outlines replace them. the bullet holes in the walls have been marked either a or b. the detectives watch smecker. he is a mess. his clothes are disheveled and his hair is frazzled.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{after talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. after she watches them whack him, she passes out.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{why the two extra victims?}
<C>__{greenly}
<D>__{witness?}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{no way they could have seen it.}
<A>__{smecker hits an orange button on the wall and a black steel door with a money slot comes slamming down in front of the first booth. he does the same thing to the last booth, leaving the middle one open. both doors possess peep holes.}
<C>__{smecker}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as i'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. a man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. the dancer gets it on the other side. she hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's}
<P>__{(makes a masturbatory gesture with hand)}
<D>__{little fireman time.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{no way they could have seen it?}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{those doors were down... which means this. they looked down in through the peep hole, saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside. pop, pop, pop, right through the glass. why?}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{maybe the three of them had something in common.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{no. this guy is big time.}
<P>__{(points to middle booth)}
<D>__{these two are street walking scum.}
<C>__{greenly}
<P>__{(kidding)}
<D>__{then that's what they had in common. they were all bad guys... now they're all dead bad guys.}
<A>__{smecker seems side tracked and ponderous at greenly's observation. he hits the orange buttons and raises the doors.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{we got another thing to think about here. we got us a genuine kennedy assassination style bullet theory. two guns were used here, guns a and b. the guy in the middle was done with both. but this guy...}
<P>__{(denotes right booth)}
<D>__{...he was killed with bullets from gun a only. and this guy...}
<P>__{(denotes left booth)}
<D>__{...gun b only. but ballistics dug two slugs out of the wall from over here where the victim was done with a.}
<A>__{smecker points to two bullet holes in the wall of the booth on the left. each is marked "b". he walks over to the right booth where in the exact location are two identical holes marked "a".}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{and it's the same story over here. why the crossover?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{theories.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{that's just fucking weird. i have no idea.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{jesus. i just can't think anymore. that scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{a guy went nuts over off of commonwealth today. shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. fled the scene. don't have much on him.}
<C>__{smecker}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{why was i not informed of this?}
<C>__{greenly}
<D>__{they weren't related. the guy used a 38. no pennies. totally amateur.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{who were the victims?}
<C>__{greenly}
<D>__{a couple of peons for the mob and...}
<C>__{smecker}
<P>__{(livid)}
<D>__{oh that's just beautiful! all the scumbags in the quiet city of boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! greenly, the day i want the boston police doing my thinking for me, i will have a fucking tag on my toe! now, get me a squad car and get me over there. i want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. now!}
<A>__{smecker storms from the room. the detectives begin to follow. smecker comes barreling back in, shoving them out of the way. he looks at the bullet holes in the walls marked "a and b" again. something has clicked.}

<P>__{(wide eyed)}
<D>__{oh... it looks like we got us a cowboy.}
