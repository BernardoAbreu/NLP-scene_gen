<A>__{thousand people are now floating where the ship went down. some are stunned, gasping for breath. others are crying, praying, moaning, shouting... screaming. jack and rose surface among them. they barely have time to gasp for air before people are clawing at them. people driven insane by the water, 4 degrees below freezing, a cold so intense it is indistinguishable form death by fire. a man pushes rose under, trying to climb on top of her... senselessly trying to get out of the water, to climb onto anything. jack punches him repeatedly, pulling her free.}

<A>__{swim, rose! swim! she tries, but her strokes are not as effective as his because of her lifejacket. they break out of the clot of people. he has to find some kind of flotation, anything to get her out of the freezing water.}

<A>__{keep swimming. keep moving. come one, you can do it. all about them there is a tremendous wailing, screaming and moaning... a chorus of tormented souls. and beyond that... nothing but black water stretching to the horizon. the sense of isolation and hopelessness is overwhelming.}
