<L>__{interior barroom night}
<A>__{the vampires, bat things and what have you, start breaking down the door. they are in a mad frenzy. they burst through the door. waiting for them are scott and kate holding uzi squirt guns and water balloons draped down their chests on a belt like grenades. jacob is holding a cross made of sharp wooden stakes and the .45 with the cross bullets. seth is holding the jackhammer. the survivors walk out of the back room into the bar. the vamps back up, letting them inside. what we have here is a mexican standoff, a la "the wild bunch." a moment of peace before the battle. the vamps just watch the humans. the humans just watch the vamps. then, like the bull in the china shop, seth ends the peace by starting up the jackhammer.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{kill 'em all!}
<A>__{jacob holds up the cross, the vamps react. the kids spray the crowd with uzi fire, burning vampire flesh. the pack of vamps retreat while the fuller squad walk forward. they are attacked on all sides, but they keep moving towards the door. seth slams the stakes into several of the vamps, it speeds in and out of vampire chests, each time spraying him in green vamp blood. jacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand and shoots three vampires with blessed bullets with the other. flame bursts from the vampires' chests when the bullets hit. kate and scott both whip water balloons off their belts and toss them into the crowd. they burst and fry several of the vamps, who fall, screaming in pain. from its perch on a wood ceiling beam, a bat thing drops and hurls toward the group. jacob sees it, raises his gun and fires. the bat thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire. seth continues carving a path to the front door by slamming the hammer stake into vampire chests. the front door is barricaded again by a big table and other junk.}
<C>__{scott}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{why did they block the door again?}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{to keep the daylight out! this is where they sleep! get to the door!}
<A>__{seth tries to get to the front door, when sex machine, now a half bat, half devil vamp, about six foot seven, drops from above in front of him. seth rams the stake in its chest. the sex machine thing screams out, lifting the hammer and seth off the ground. seth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the room, he crashes into a table. the sex machine thing falls back with the jackhammer sticking out of his chest, dead. kate, spraying uzi fire like rambo, sees seth fall. she screams:}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{seth!}
<A>__{seth quickly gets up to find himself surrounded by vampires on all sides. with no weapons, he puts up on dukes.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{okay, dead boys, come on! take a bite and feel all right!}
<A>__{kate clusters with her father and scott.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{i'm going for 'em!}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{everybody goes home!}
<A>__{kate turns into a squirt gun firing, water balloon throwing, one woman army, as she breaks from her father and heads in seth's direction.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{die, monster, die! die, monster, die!}
<A>__{kate mows down the group by seth, they lie on the floor, burning in agony. kate takes seth's hand and gives him a couple of water balloons and a stake.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(to seth)}
<D>__{watch my back!}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{anytime.}
<A>__{cutting through vampires, the two make their way across the bar. jacob, firing the .45, takes out several more vampires in fiery death. scott fires the uzi and chucks more water balloons. as jacob fights, all of a sudden the sound goes out. he can't hear anything. he wonders if he's gone deaf. he starts to hear the words: "thirst, thirst, thirst." he notices the vampires have stopped attacking him. they look at him wit happy smiles on their devilish faces. fangs begin to grow. his eyes are yellow. scott turns to his dad. he sees his father is a monster. jacob, with a devilish grin on his face, grabs scott and sinks his teeth into scott's forearm. scott screams bloody murder as his dad begins to drain him of blood. scott takes one of the water balloons he's wearing and smashes it against jacob's head. the holy water melts half of jacob's face away. he lets go of scott, screaming, and drops the .45 on the floor. scott drops to the ground, picking up the gun. he brings it up to fire. a totally evil jacob, with only half a face, matches stares with the boy he once called his son. scott's eyes turn to steel.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{i swear to god, in jesus christ's name.}
<A>__{he fires, sending a holy bullet into jacob's forehead, creating a hole from which fire shoots out. jacob's entire head bursts into flames, then explodes. from across the room, fate sees her daddy ignite. she cries out. in the thick of the battle, seth yells:}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{fight now, cry later.}
<A>__{kate takes his advice and hits a vamp square in the face with a holy water balloon, which melts his head. a bat thing lands on the back of scott's neck. he screams as it bites into him. he drops the .45. kate sees scott get bit.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<A>__{another bat thing lands on scott's arm and takes a bite. scott screams.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{you bastards!}
<A>__{she goes to spray them when her uzi runs out of water. now seven bat things are on scott biting and sucking blood. scott is in agony.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{kill me, kate!}
<A>__{kate runs for her brother, does a dive and a roll, coming up by the .45, snatching it in one motion and firing three times. one... two... three bat things are hit, shoot flames, then all of them explode, blowing up scott. the remaining vamps approach. all the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy balloon.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{how many bullets left, kid?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{not many.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. make 'em sing for their supper.}
<A>__{the two survivors are backed up against a wall. two bat things do a kamikaze dive from the air toward seth. seth throws the holy balloon at them. direct hit. the two bat things burst into flames and spiral to the floor. the two survivors look at the vampires, who stand before them. a moment of stillness before the attack. kate stands holding the .45, arm outstretched.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(to seth)}
<D>__{should i use the last bullets on us?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.}
<A>__{the vamps begins to close in. kate lines up the .45 sights on the face of an approaching vampire. seth holds the uzi like a club, ready to bash in the first vampire's head that gets in swinging distance. beams of sunlight shoot through the holes that kate shot through the wall. approaching vampires burn. the scorched vamps scream like they've never screamed before.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{shoot more holes!}
<A>__{kate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall behind him, daylight comes through, providing kate and seth with a safe, lighted area. the .45's empty. the vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being able to get at them. the two survivors hold hands, when... all of a sudden the door to the titty twister is pounded on from the outside. the vamps look towards it in horror. from the other side of the door, we hear a voice with a spanish accent.}
<C>__{voice }
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{i'm looking for my friend. is seth in there?}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{carlos!}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{help us, bash the door. bash the door in!}
<C>__{carlos }
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{danny, manny, knock down the door. hurry, hurry!}
<A>__{the vamps are totally fucking freaked out! they run and fly around the bar in a panic. crying, howling, grabbing onto each other. the front door is torn apart from shotgun fir coming from the outside, punching holes the size of basketballs in the door. the table in front of the door gives and falls forward. the door caves in and sunlight invades the bar. many vamps are instantly fried, bursting into flames. the mexican gangster carlso and his two henchmen, danny and manny, are horrified at what they see. they cross themselves in fright. vampires search for dark corners, but all is lost. sunlight hits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling, sending hundreds of beams of sunlight scattering through the room. vamps try and dodge the beams. no dice. all around the vamps combust in fiery explosions. the titty twister is now on fire, burning out of control. seth and kate run through the building and leap through the door into the parking lot.}
