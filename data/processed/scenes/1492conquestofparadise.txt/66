<A>__{columbus' head nods lower and lower to his chest. he is asleep. we become aware of a sharp buzzing sound. it becomes louder as we move closer to columbus' face. a mosquito lands on his temple. columbus reflexively slaps it. he wakes up, and looks at his fingers a spot of blood, a crushed mosquito. he stares at it for a moment. then slowly gets to his feet.}
