<L>__{interior peppy's house george's bedroom & corridor night}
<D>__{it's night time. george is in bed. he opens one eye. then he wakes up and looks around, not understanding where he is. jack wakes up and barks, wags his tail. a nurse who had been dozing in an armchair facing the bed awakes with a start, then goes over to george. she reassures him, motions to him not to get upset, then slowly leaves the room before running off down the corridor. she knocks at a door then goes back to george's room. peppy is close on her heels. she comes into the room in her nightgown. when he sees her, george smiles and she rushes over to the bed and puts her arms tight around him. she is terribly moved but, when she releases him from her arms to talk to him, she realizes that he has lost consciousness again and so was not sharing the same special moment as she. she pulls a face, afraid she might have done something wrong, glances over at the nurse, then lays george's head back on his pillow.}
