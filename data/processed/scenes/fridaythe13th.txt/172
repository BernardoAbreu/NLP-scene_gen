<A>__{the door opens and brenda comes in with her lantern and slicker. her actions are direct and business like. brenda goes first to the row of sinks and looked at herself in the mirror, holding up a propane coleman lantern like an examination lamp. she takes out a toothbrush and some other toilet articles. she flips on both faucets and nothing comes out. she put her lantern down on the floor and turns on the water valves. she stands up, and washes her hands and face. she turns off the faucets and now we hear the dripping sound that marcie had heard. brenda looks off at the shower stalls, shrugs, picks up her lantern and makes her exit.}
