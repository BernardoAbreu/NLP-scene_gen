<L>__{exterior ruins of wat}
<A>__{serene despite the ravages of centuries, two stone buddhas thirty feet tall sit flanking the stairs to the ruined temple. trees and vines all but obscure the cracked and tumbled forms of ornately carved walls. the central courtyard is open to the sky. spire like structures are dimly visible in the fog beyond.}
<C>__{brewer}
<P>__{(hushed)}
<D>__{this place is a trip.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{buddhist monastery. fifteenth century.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{damn! leeches.}
<A>__{he has pulled up his pant leg to reveal three squirming black worms attached to his calf, sucking on him. rambo moves off, scanning, unconcerned.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{get used to 'em.}
<B>__{tight on brewer}
<A>__{lighting a cigarette, his hands tightly cupped around the glow. rambo slaps it out of his hand. stomps it out.}
<C>__{brewer}
<P>__{(hissing)}
<D>__{you fucking crazy? i need it to burn these things off.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{no cigarettes.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{i had it cupped.}
<A>__{rambo takes the pack from brewer's breast pocket and grinds it into the mud under his boot.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{look, rambo. i've had enough of your bad ass indian scout bullshit. you're years out of date... i'm makin' a career out of teaching you the hardware. as far as i'm concerned you're just along to back me up. and i heard about you... about how twitchy you really are. kill any civilians lately?}
<A>__{brewer is hurled against a stone wall and pinned with a knife to his throat so rapidly he's not sure how it happened. rambo is in his face, speaking very softly.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{listen real careful, freshmeat. i don't know why they sent you. maybe they didn't want to waste a good man. but you screw up once more and i will kill you myself.}
<A>__{rambo whips away, moves quietly off. shaking with rage, brewer levels his weapon at rambo's back. then he realizes how silly that would be. frustrated, he jogs to catch up.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{man, are you strict.}
<A>__{moving in the shadows, rambo walks through the ruins noiselessly. a voice emerges from the mist behind them, an almost childlike lilt.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{you are first tourist here in long time.}
<A>__{brewer whips around, centering the aiming dot of his sighting laser on a figure sitting on a ledge above them. sitting cross legged and unperturbed is a diminutive vietnamese woman of about 28. the dot of brewer's laser is centered on her forehead like a hindu prayer mark. she is absolutely beautiful, with wide, calm eyes and strong but sensuous mouth which curves now in a small quirky grin.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you come here see buddha... ask for truth? or just lost?}
<C>__{brewer}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{should i waste her?}
<A>__{rambo pushes his rifle barrel aside and takes a step forward. when he speaks it is in fluent vietnamese.}
<C>__{rambo}
<P>__{(viet subtitled)}
<D>__{i'm not lost. just looking for someone.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(viet subtitled)}
<D>__{someone called maybe 'night orchid'?}
<C>__{rambo}
<P>__{(viet subtitled)}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(viet subtitled)}
<D>__{i'm co phuong bao.}
<C>__{rambo}
<P>__{(to brewer)}
<D>__{she's our contact.}
<C>__{brewer}
<P>__{(grudgingly impressed)}
<D>__{i didn't know you spoke vietnamese.}
<A>__{co slides down from the ledge and stands before them, almost two heads shorter than rambo. her lithe figure is not entirely concealed by her loose black "pajamas". she wears her hair in a long single braid and has the delicate hands of a child.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{i'm rambo. this is brewer.}
<P>__{(to brewer)}
<D>__{her name is co.}
<C>__{co}
<D>__{it means "virgin." my mother was comedian.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{howdy, co.}
<A>__{he sticks out his hand but rambo motions "no". she bows slightly.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{uh, you speak pretty good english. where'd you learn?}
<C>__{co}
<D>__{university of saigon. have masters degree in economics. not use too much now... communists in charge. you got time... want to eat?}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{sure. whattaya got?}
<A>__{co reaches up onto the ledge, her previous perch, and pulls down a small pack, actually a food tube of the sort worn over one shoulder by viet cong and other vietnamese guerrillas.}
<C>__{co}
<P>__{(opening it)}
<D>__{nuac mam.}
<A>__{she unrolls several rubber tree leaves holding rice with a pungent sauce. rambo takes the food and the proffered chopsticks and, squatting, begins shoveling it expertly.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{you really got a masters degree?}
<C>__{co}
<D>__{sure. i only sound like forty year old in your language.}
<A>__{brewer fumbles with the sticks. switches to fingers.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{what's this stuff on the rice?}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{fermented fish sauce.}
<A>__{brewer's expression is less than enthusiastic.}
