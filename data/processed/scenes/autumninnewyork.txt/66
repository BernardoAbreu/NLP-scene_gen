<L>__{interior wills' living room afternoon}
<A>__{a fire burns in the fireplace. still wearing his coat, wills stands by the mantel, sorting through a stack of mail }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i'm not even tempted!}
<C>__{charlotte's voice}
<P>__{(from another room)}

<A>__{olivia enters with a steamy mug }
<C>__{olivia}
<D>__{you like hot cider?}

<A>__{she carefully takes his coat off him as he sips the cider }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{mmmm.}
<C>__{olivia}
<D>__{charlotte made it. i just poured it in the cup.}
<A>__{she exits. as wills sips the drink, he sits on the leather sofa and continues to glance through his mail. suddenly, shocked, he stops on a letter. he sets his mug down. he hears charlotte making noise in the next room. he opens the letter and begins to read. his eyes dart down the page, but he quickly sees that the letter is not friendly. his face shows disappointment. he hears footsteps in the hall. he folds the letter up, slips it back into its envelope, and jams it in his back pocket. charlotte enters and throws her hands out to her side }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{ta da!}
<A>__{she stands before him, dressed in a white spinsterly victorian outfit with braids coiled at her ears. wills smiles with appreciation }

<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{uncultured swine.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{the truth is out. i've lost you forever.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{wanna bet?}
<A>__{she lays her head on his chest, smiling contentedly. a subtle shadow of apprehension passes over wills' features. eyes closed, she asks }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{when do i get to see your costume?}
