<L>__{exterior louisiana bayou creek bed last night 24 hours ago. the hurricane rages. a hand pulls the pin on}
<A>__{a phosphorous grenade and chucks it. it blows, frying brush and nothing more. west comes over the hill, running to investigate. he stops at what he sees. nunez stands unarmed in the creek bed, surrounded by the other section eight cadets. a prisoner.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{what the fuck is going on?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{your weapons, sergeant.}
<A>__{west doesn't move. kendall walks over and disarms west, pushing him into the circle next to the terrified nunez.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{is this about that little drug business you all are running? yeah, i know about that, roberto told me }
<C>__{nunez}
<D>__{shut up! look, we won't say anything }
<C>__{west}
<D>__{fuck that. you little pissers really think you can throw a scare into me?}
<A>__{dunbar raises his rifle and shoots nunez. he goes down, twitches once and lies still. dead. west looks at dunbar.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{you're gonna have to do a lot better than that, son.}
<C>__{hardy }
<D>__{how about this?}
<A>__{and with that, tom hardy emerges from the brush carrying, a combat knife. west's eyes sparkle with recognition.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{didn't i kick your ass out for this drug thing fifteen years ago?}
<A>__{hardy just smiles.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{should've known you were involved in this. come on then. let's see you try and stick me }
<A>__{moving faster than west thought imaginable, hardy moves and the knife flashes, cutting west open stem to sternum. hardy grips the older man by the shoulders, lowering him to the ground as he dies. whispering in his ear:}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{stem to sternum. you taught me well, sarge.}
<A>__{and west dies. a moment of utter silence and then voices from the past begin coming back to us:}
<C>__{styles }
<D>__{you think you could explain all this to me?}
<A>__{kendall walks over to hardy and hands him a pistol.}
<C>__{hardy }
<D>__{i wouldn't know where to start.}
<A>__{kendall holds out his arm, gritting his teeth...}
<C>__{hardy }
<D>__{i guess it was about one man framing another...}
<A>__{and hardy shoots kendall once, through the arm.}
