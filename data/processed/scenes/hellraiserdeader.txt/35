<L>__{exterior poteilari and minvara day}
<A>__{a ragged, run down place, looking bleak and ugly in the bright light of day. we see the street sign, identifying the place poteilari and minvara. a cab pulls up and amy gets out. she crosses the street, passes one side door and then comes to a building that's been sealed up doors and windows cemented shut with cinder blocks. beyond a narrow railing is a stairway, pressed up sideways against the building, running down to a basement entrance. amy looks down the stairway to it's narrow bottom. the stairs and the bottom are littered with trash. a filthy mattress lies at the very bottom. amy heads down.}
