<A>__{in his hand.}

<A>__{louis the sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the blue diamond of the crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time louis lost everything from the neck up. the theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart like shape... and it became le coeur de la mer. the heart of the ocean. today it would be worth more than the hope diamond.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{it was a dreadful, heavy thing.}
<P>__{(she points at the drawing)}
<A>__{i only wore it this once.}
<C>__{lizzy}
<A>__{you actually believe this is you, grandma?}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{it is me, dear. wasn't i a hot number?}
<C>__{lovett}
<A>__{i tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. do you know who the claiment was, rost?}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{someone named hockley, i should imagine.}
<C>__{lovett}
<A>__{nathan hockley, right. pittsburgh steel tycoon. for a diamond necklace his son caledon hockley bought in france for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on titanic. and the claim was filed right after the sinking. so the diamond had to've gone down with the ship.}
<P>__{(to lizzy)}
<A>__{see the date?}
<C>__{lizzy}
<A>__{april 14, 1912.}
<C>__{lovett}
<A>__{if your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day titanic sank.}
<C>__{lovett }
<P>__{(to rose)}
<A>__{and that makes you my new best friend. i will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{i don't want your money, mr. lovett. i know how hard it is for people who care greatly for money to give some away.}
<C>__{bodine}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<A>__{you don't want anything?}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(indicating the drawing)}
<A>__{you may give me this, if anything i tell you is of value.}
<C>__{lovett}
<A>__{deal.}
<P>__{(crossing the room)}
<A>__{over here are a few things we've recovered from your staterooms. laid out on a worktable are fifty or so objects, from mundane to valuable. rose, shrunken in her chair, can barely see over the table top. with a trembling hand she lifts a tortoise shell hand mirror, inlaid with mother of pearl. she caresses it wonderingly.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{this was mine. how extraordinary! it looks the same as the last time i saw it. she turns the mirror over and looks at her ancient face in the cracked glass.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{the reflection has changed a bit. she spies something else, a silver and moonstone art nouveau brooch.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{my mother's brooch. she wanted to go back for it. caused quite a fuss. rose picks up an ornate art nouveau hair comb. a jade butterfly takes flight on the ebony handle of the comb. she turns it slowly, remembering. we can see that rose is experiencing a rush of images and emotions that have lain dormant for eight decades as she handles the butterfly comb.}
<C>__{lovett}
<A>__{are you ready to go back to titanic?}
