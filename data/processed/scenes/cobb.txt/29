<A>__{silence. the morning mist hangs thick over a snowbank in the woods. a rabbit scurries across the snow, some quail are flushed. pan across the landscape reveals the lodge. smoke curls from the chimney.}

<L>__{interior lodge morning}
<A>__{stump sits hunkered over a tiny portable typewriter on the kitchen table. cobb mixes a bourbon with orange juice to wash down some more pills, which he takes randomly. a teletype machine sits on a table nearby throughout the scene, a tape clicks endlessly out, piling on the floor. cobb occasionally checks data on the tape.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{ready, mr. cobb.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{chapter one, page one...}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{i'm ready.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{'know ye that a prince and a great man has fallen this day.'}
<A>__{stump types it out, then stops.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{what the hell is that?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{that's what robert e. lee said at the burial of my grandfather who was a confederate general killed at fredricksburg.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{so i'm taking notes?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{hell no. that's the first line of my autobiography.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{i ain't writing it.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{it's horseshit. it's a third person comment about someone who's already dead. an autobiography has to be in the first person plus it can't come from the other side of the god damn grave.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{my story can come from any damn place i want.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{not to mention you can't call yourself 'a prince and great man' that's for the world to decide.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{what kind of a fucking writer you call yourself all tied up in rules and regulations. what's the point being a writer if you can't say what you want to?}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{you're not treating me like a writer you're treating me like a stenographer.}
<A>__{blam! a shot rings out stump types quickly, hunting and pecking with two fingers, reading aloud.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{know ye that a prince and a great man has fallen this day...}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{it has a certain ring to it...}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{yes it does.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{i thought you might like it. it's yours, a gift from me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{'cobb, a prince among men, misunderstood in his genius, as genius always is' }
<P>__{(demands from stump)}
<D>__{this is the second line from what will be the greatest biography of a great man ever written type it!}
<A>__{cobb checks the tape and suddenly is deep in thought over some information coming across. stump types.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{bethlehem steel's about to dive.}
<A>__{cobb grabs a phone and dials then barks into the phone.}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{jameson. bethlehem's going in the toilet. dump it all!}
<A>__{cobb slams down the phone, momentarily lost in finance.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{you got a stock tip for me?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{yeah... buy coca cola. we're about to go out in cans.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{coke in cans? i don't think so.}
<A>__{cobb just stares back in disdain. then, suddenly cobb starts coughing terribly. he clutches his torso as if it were about to fall into pieces.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you know what's wrong with ty cobb?}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{every disease known to man i got 'em all! and they'll never get me in a hospital never!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{my heart leaks the doctors who are nothin' but a buncha hacksaw artists give me digoxin to keep it pumping...}
<A>__{cobb grabs a bottle of digoxin pills and flings it across the room in a rage. he flings bottles of pills as he recites his ailments.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{they give me darvon for the cancer in my back, they give me tace for something eatin' up my stomach, fleets compound for an infection in my bowels, librium for my tension, insulin for my diabetes...}
<A>__{cobb grabs a hypodermic needle and awkwardly pours from a bottle into the chamber. insulin spills as he does.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{fuckin' insulin...}
<A>__{he jams the needle wildly into his arm without hesitation. he takes a deep breath as if the drug has produced an immediate relief from pain.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{and if all that wasn't enough, it's been two years since i got my pecker in the air...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the south may not rise again but my dick will.}
<A>__{the phone rings.}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(barks)}
<D>__{i ain't here!}
<A>__{stump answers the phone.}
<C>__{stump}
<P>__{(answering the phone)}
<D>__{cobb's residence... hello.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he's not here who's calling? ernie? ernie who?}
<P>__{(his face drops)}
<D>__{my god...}
<P>__{(to cobb)}
<D>__{it's ernest hemingway... for you.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{tell him to go to hell!}
<A>__{stump covers the receiver nervously.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{jesus christ, ty, this is the great american writer this is the man who inspired me to become a writer!}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{tell him to go to hell anyway.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{him and me used to be pals but we went on a hunting trip once and he hired a shitty guide.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{that's it? you didn't like a guide he hired?}
<A>__{cobb looks at stump with a fierceness that is so over whelming, so physical, that stump melts.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you tell him to go fuck himself or i will kick your yankee ass!}
<A>__{stump is terrified. he reluctantly uncovers the receiver.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{mr. hemingway? mr. cobb says... to go to hell.}
<P>__{(awkwardly)}
<D>__{by the way i'm a big fan of yours }
<A>__{click, a hang up. cobb settles into a chair, letting the drugs and pills and booze work their way into his thick body.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{hemingway isn't a bullfighter he wrote about bullfighting. what the hell is that?!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{bullshit... damn painkillers...}
<A>__{cobb rubs his head the drugs are taking effect.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{ty, you okay?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{it'll pass...}
<P>__{(increasingly woozy)}
<D>__{stumpy, listen to me you know what i need?}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{what do you need?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{i need a woman.}
<P>__{(muttering to sleep)}
<D>__{a woman is definitely what i need...}
<A>__{and cobb drifts to sleep in his chair, momentarily overcome with painkillers. stump stares at the sleeping volcano of a man, and when cobb starts snoring heavily, he rises, pulls on a coat, scarf, and hat, and heads out the door.}
