<D>__{if x net is allowed to open it's the beginning of the end of a free and open cyberspace. we can't let plexor get away with this. our game plan has not changed. tron was specially programmed to break into x net and shut down power supplies. we would then exploit these weak points and cripple the system. tron's role was essential one of you must take his place.}
<A>__{he holds up tron's disk.}

<D>__{it's the most dangerous job. if you're not up for it, nobody's going to blame you.}
<A>__{all stand firm. flynn lays tron's disk in the first fighter's hands. fighter summons his will, causing the disk to glow faintly. but it soon goes dark again. next fighter holds the disk, bearing down, animating the circuits... but he buckles and the disk falls dims. mega worries: one by one, fighters fail to power tron's disk. flynn reaches the end of the line. mega puts her hands out to receive the disk. flynn hesitates, then hands her tron's disk. mega clenches it, concentrating deeply. her energy infuses the disk, animating its circuits stronger than anyone. bur soon, her eyes strobe, her body circuits overload. she lets go. tron's disk thunks the floor, goes dark. mega hardens her resolve.}
