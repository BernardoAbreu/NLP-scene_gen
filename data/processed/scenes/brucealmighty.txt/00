<L>__{interior kowolski's bakery kitchen day}
<A>__{a news crew shuttles around a gigantic cookie. standing by are the kowolski brothers, gustov and vol, two short, stocky, men, along with mother kowolski and other bakery family employees. a "30 year anniversary" sign hangs in the background. bruce nolan looks into a make up mirror, desperately trying to place a large segment of wayward hair.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{oh, god, no! the hair's wrong. this is a bad sign.}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{we really need to get a make up person?!}
<A>__{the segment producer, ally loman, steps over.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{not in the budget. and not to worry, you're going to look great in this.}
<A>__{she holds out a hair net.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{a hair net? i'm not wearing a hair net. i just did the hair.}
<C>__{ally}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{health code. in the kitchen or around the cookie, you gotta have it.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(to crew: re hair net)}
<D>__{you guy's should tell me this before hand, this is like a huge waste of...moose.}
<A>__{bruce spreads the hair net, bends down out of frame, comes up looking ridiculous and very disgruntled.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{remind me to swing by an elementary school after this and serve lunch.}
<A>__{ally laughs.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{you're a thing of beauty. in three, two, one. . .}
<A>__{bruce snaps from pissed to instant charismatic tv newsman. (note: whenever bruce speaks on camera he speaks in his "reporter's voice" that recognizable, too smooth delivery that all news reporters seem to have. in mathematical terms bruce's version is to the 7th power.)}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{for three decades the kowolski family bakery has been a mainstay in downtown buffalo. known for their sinfully rich, cream filled, deep fried polski pierogis. and the occasional sugar induced coma that follows. today, in honor of their 30 year anniversary, momma kowolski and her sons gustov and vol, decided to do something, a little bit different. tell me guys, how did this idea come about?}
<C>__{gustov}
<D>__{well, vol said to me, 'gustov, why don't we make the biggest chocolate chip cookie in buffalo?' and i said, 'yeah, sure.'}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{wow. fascinating.}
<A>__{bruce steps up to the huge cookie.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{the previous buffalo cookie record was 3 feet, 17 inches baked by gladys pelsnick. but this behemoth cookie clearly proving that gustov and vol have much more free time.}
<A>__{the kowolski brothers and all celebrate in the background, toasting with big mugs of milk. bruce steps forward, looks dramatically at camera, slow zoom in as he speaks.}
<C>__{bruce }
<D>__{as we witness the ceremonial toasting with milk it makes one pause and think. what are we really looking at here?}
<C>__{bruce }
<D>__{is it just a big cookie or does this cookie represent the pride of buffalo? our dedicated and hard working citizens the key ingredient, with a few nuts thrown in.}
<P>__{(motions his eyes to the kowolski twins)}
<D>__{and finally, the love of our families which provides the warm chewy center making our beloved buffalo the sweetest place to live.}
<A>__{camera is in close as bruce signs off.}
<C>__{bruce }
<D>__{and that's the way the cookie crumbles. i'm bruce nolan, eyewitness news.}
<A>__{bruce's hair net slips up, puffing his hair into a bun on the top of his head. the kowolskis and bystanders all laugh. the frame freezes. we pull back from the tv and find bruce holding the remote, watching the recorded spot on tv. we are now...}
