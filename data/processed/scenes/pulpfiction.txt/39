<L>__{interior jackrabbit slim's night}
<A>__{compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint english pub. posters from 50's a.i.p. movies are all over the wall ("rock all night," "high school confidential," "attack of the crab monster," and "machine gun kelly"). the booths that the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s cars. in the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. a big sign on the wall states, "no shoes allowed." some wannabe beboppers (actually melrose types), do the twist in their socks or barefeet. the picture windows don't look out the street, but instead, b & w movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. the waitresses and waiters are made up as replicas of 50's icons: marilyn monroe, zorro, james dean, donna reed, martin and lewis, and the philip morris midget, wait on tables wearing appropriate costumes. vincent and mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red '59 edsel. buddy holly (their waiter), comes over, sporting a big button on his chest that says: "hi i'm buddy, pleasing you please me."}

<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{just checking.}
<A>__{buddy exits. vincent takes a look around the place. the yuppies are dancing, the diners are biting into big, juicy hamburgers, and the icons are playing their parts. marilyn is squealing, the midget is paging philip morris, donna reed is making her customers drink their milk, and dean and jerry are acting a fool.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{whaddya think?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{it's like a wax museum with a pulse rate.}
<A>__{vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling himself a smoke. after a second of watching him}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{rollin' a smoke.}
<C>__{mia}

<A>__{as he finishes licking it}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{you can have this one, cowgirl.}
<A>__{he hands her the rolled smoke. she takes it, putting it to her lips. out of nowhere appears a zippo lighter in vincent's hand. he lights it.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{think nothing of it.}
<A>__{he begins rolling one for himself. as this time, the sound of a subway car fills the diner, making everything shake and rattle. marilyn monroe runs to a square vent in the floor. an imaginary subway train blows the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out a squeal. the entire restaurant applauds. back to mia and vincent.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{marsellus said you just got back from amsterdam.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{sure did. i heard you did a pilot.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{that was my fifteen minutes.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{what was it?}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{it was show about a team of female secret agents called "fox force five."}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{"fox force five." fox, as in we're a bunch of foxy chicks. force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with. five, as in there's one... two ... three... four... five of us. there was a blonde one, sommerset o'neal from that show "baton rouge," she was the leader. a japanese one, a black one, a french one and a brunette one, me. we all had special skills. sommerset had a photographic memory, the japanese fox was a kung fu master, the black girl was a demolition expert, the french fox' specialty was sex...}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{what was your specialty?}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{knives. the character i played, raven mccoy, her background was she was raised by circus performers. so she grew up doing a knife act. according to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife. but because she grew up in a circus, she was also something of an acrobat. she could do illusions, she was a trapeze artist when you're keeping the world safe from evil, you never know when being a trapeze artist's gonna come in handy. and she knew a zillion old jokes her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her. if we woulda got picked up, they woulda worked in a gimmick where every episode i woulda told and ol joke.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{do you remember any of the jokes?}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{well i only got the chance to say one, 'cause we only did one show.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{tell me.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{no. it's really corny.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{c'mon, don't be that way.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{no. you won't like it and i will be embarrassed.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{you told it in front of fifty million people and you can't tell it to me? i promise i won't laugh.}
<C>__{mia}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{that's what i'm afraid of.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{that's not what i meant and you know it.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{you're quite the silver tongue devil, aren't you?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i meant i wouldn't laugh at you.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{that's not what you said vince. well now i'm definitely not gonna tell ya, 'cause it's been built up too much.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{what a gyp.}
<A>__{buddy comes back with the drinks. mia wraps her lips around the straw of her shake.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{yummy!}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{can i have a sip of that? i'd like to know what a five dollar shake tastes like.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{be my guest.}
<A>__{she slides the shake over to him.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{you can use my straw, i don't have kooties.}
<A>__{vincent smiles.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{yeah, but maybe i do.}

<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i don't know if it's worth five dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' good.}
<A>__{he slides the shake back. then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{don't you hate that?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{uncomfortable silences. why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{that's when you know you found somebody special. when you can just shit the fuck up for a minute, and comfortably share silence.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i don't think we're there yet. but don't feel bad, we just met each other.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{well i will tell you what, i will go to the bathroom and powder my nose, while you sit here and think of something to say.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i will do that.}
