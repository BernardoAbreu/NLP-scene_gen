<L>__{interior the nolan house, new orleans night, 1918}
<A>__{a piano's playing a standard, people singing.... there's a myriad of old dark rooms... heavy furniture and carpets... an eclectic mixture of the possessions of those who have lived and died here over many years... and we see a parlor is crowded with old people, from sixty to ninety five, in various stages of health... various contraptions to keep them "afloat". an old age home. we see queenie moving quietly along a hallway, carrying the crying baby so as not to be seen. tizzy, following her, still anxiously whispering after her...}
<C>__{a woman's }
<D>__{where are you, queenie...?}
<C>__{queenie}
<D>__{hold your water...}
<P>__{(and to tizzy)}
<D>__{go see to them.}
<A>__{he does what she asks. she hurries the baby into a small room, literally like a mouse house, under the stairs...}
