<L>__{interior the ramesseum}
<A>__{filled with treasures and plunder from the middle kingdom. it's very dark and quiet in here, the only light is from flickering torches at either end of the spooky gallery. the noise again! from the far side of the room. feet, slowly shuffling, plodding across the floor. evelyn grabs a torch. looks around, at a statue of anubis, another of horus, they stare down at evelyn, who is starting to get scared now. she walks down the aisle. past a closed sarcophagus. past cases of ancient artifacts. past another sarcophagus, only this one is open! evelyn freezes, swallows hard, nervously looks around to see who could have opened it. then she slowly leans forward with the torch, and peers inside. a hideous rotted mummy sits up and screeches at her! evelyn screams, drops the torch and backs away, scared out of her wits. and then, coming from inside the sarcophagus, she hears a man laughing. her eyes narrow as a foppish cad crawls out from behind the mummy, laughing his ass off, half drunk.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{you...! you...!}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{drunkard? fool? rat bastard? please call me something original.}
<A>__{meet jonathan carnarvon. as he crawls out of the sarcophagus, evelyn pulls a cigarette out of the mummy's mouth.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{have you no respect for the dead?}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{right now, i only wish to join them.}
<A>__{he grins drunkenly. evelyn punches him hard in the chest.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{well i wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{my dear, sweet, baby sister, i will have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.}
<A>__{he belches, then falls back and sits on the edge of a tomb.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{high note? ha! for five years you've been scrounging around egypt, and what have you to show for it? nothing.}
<A>__{jonathan excitedly starts scrounging around in his jacket.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{oh yes i do! i have something right here!}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{oh no, not another worthless trinket, jonathan, if i bring one more piece of junk to the curator to try and sell for you.}
<A>__{jonathan pulls out a small, ancient box; the collapsed key to imhotep's sarcophagus and coffin. evelyn is instantly curious, she grabs the box out of his hand.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{where did you get this?}
<A>__{jonathan knows her weaknesses, gives her a mischievous smile.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{on a dig, down in thebes.}
<A>__{evelyn rolls the box around in her hands, mumbling to herself as she translates the hieratics and hieroglyphs covering it. jonathan licks his lips in anticipation.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{my whole life i've never found anything, evy. tell me i've found something.}
<A>__{evelyn's fingers play with the various little slats on the box, shifting them this way and that way, it's like a puzzle box. then suddenly, it unfolds itself, almost mechanically, turning itself into the key. sitting inside the open key box is a folded piece of golden papyrus. an ancient map.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{jonathan?}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i think you found something.}
