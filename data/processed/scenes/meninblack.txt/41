<L>__{exterior battery park dusk}
<A>__{almost nighttime now, and the park is empty. edwards is still on the bench. and still thinking. above him, the stars are coming out. slowly, he looks up, into the vastness of the heavens.}

<L>__{interior garage day}
<A>__{the next morning. a door opens on a garage and an orkin man steps inside, carrying a tank of toxic gas. the morning light spills on an abundance of spiders, crawling everywhere big ones, small ones, hundreds of them have moved in and taken over this dusty place. the orkin man sighs and sets down his tank.}
<C>__{orkin man}
<D>__{well, well, well. movin' right in, are we? think we own the place?}
<A>__{he unfurls a hose from the side of the tank.}
<C>__{orkin man }
<D>__{got a little eviction notice for you, boys.}
<A>__{he raises a mask to his face and unscrews the handle on the top of the tank. lethal gas starts to hiss from the end of the hose.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{just what exactly do you think you're doing?}
<A>__{the orkin man turns around. edgar stands in the doorway to the garage, staring at him disdainfully.}
<C>__{orkin man}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{takin' care of your pest problem.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{"pest" problem? "pest?"}
<C>__{orkin man}
<D>__{yeah. you got a hell of an infestation.}
<A>__{edgar advances on him, slowly.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{you know, i have noticed an infestation here. everywhere i look, in fact. nothing but undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious pond scum. so convinced of their own superiority as they scurry about their short, pointless lives.}
<C>__{orkin man}
<D>__{well yeah. don't you want to get rid of 'em?}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{in the worst way.}
<A>__{edgar lashes out quickly, jerking the mask off the orkin man's face with one hand and shoving the gas hose down his throat with the other. the orkin man's car keys drop to the garage floor, and edgar picks them up.}
