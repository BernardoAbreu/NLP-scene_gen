<D>__{if we'd stayed at the road we would be safe now! now we've got no water, no food or, or...}
<P>__{(noticing lyn's scanning) will you}
<D>__{forget about the fucking tantric currents?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<P>__{(patiently)}
<D>__{you're going to be okay.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{stop saying that! i just got blown up! i'm in the middle of a desert! i'm not gonna be okay!}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{bob, you're suffering from shock. if you start panicking now your heart's gonna stop.}
<A>__{bob stares after him incredulously.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(losing it)}
<D>__{is that...is that supposed to calm me down?! (hurrying after him) you know what color the seats were in the frigging hotel but you can't...you wanna observe something lyn? observe the fucking bomb in the middle of the road!}
<A>__{lyn walks on without answering. bob notices the sun is sinking.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{wait a minute. that's west. al qaim's in that direction. we're going the wrong way.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{the mission isn't in al qaim. it's somewhere near al qaim.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{is that...is that...is that a joke? we've come six hundred miles and you don't know where we're going?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{if the exact whereabouts of the target was known it wouldn't take a jedi to find them, would it?}
<A>__{bob watches lyn stare around him, looking pale and drawn and, for the first time, afraid.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{who gave you the mission lyn?}
<P>__{(beat) lyn?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{bill did.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{bill did. he appeared in my trailer two months ago. a psychic projection. i could hear him calling my name.}
<A>__{bob is so staggered by this for a moment he can't speak.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{oh...oh jesus.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{he needed me.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{oh jesus. oh jesus lyn. there's no mission? we're in the middle of the desert because you heard voices? there's no one here! there's no one fucking here.}
<A>__{lyn starts to walk off but staggers and falls.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{lyn!}
<A>__{bob rushes to him, kneels beside him. lyn clutches his stomach, grimaces.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{is it the crohns?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{i don't have crohns.}
<C>__{bob}
