<C>__{mascot}
<D>__{go meerkats! go meerkats!}
<A>__{he can't seem to get himself or the student body as excited with the exception of marianne and nina, in the stands applauding proudly. the school band is playing `goldfinger.' across the gym, olive sits with rhiannon.}

<D>__{what the fuck is a meerkat anyway?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{beats the hell out of me. but can we just take a moment to applaud the barbara bush high school marching band for their very ambitious effort to learn all of the james bond theme music in a single year? i personally wish them all the best in their endeavor. ku dos!}
