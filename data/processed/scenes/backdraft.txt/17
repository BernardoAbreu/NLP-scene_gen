<L>__{exterior brownstone night}
<A>__{an expensive one. we hear a window break.}
<L>__{interior brownstone night}
<A>__{through the dimness a file cabinet. an axe suddenly slams into it, ripping it apart. files crash to the floor. and a picture. 1970. four young guys marlin fishing. time of their lives.}
<L>__{interior brownstone bedroom night}
<A>__{and a grey putty being slapped along the edges of a door.}
<L>__{interior pub night}
<A>__{a split level firemen's dive; complete with mounted axes and personalized t shirts from various engine companies proudly declaring "ladder co. 6 axe first, hose later" and "chicago fd, 150 years of tradition unimpeded by progress". tonight the place is firmly in the hands of an army of recently graduated candidates. a few on the back patio have hooked up a charged hoseline and are taking potshots at balloon targets, each other, the neighbor's cat. brian and tim, still in their uniforms, enter from the street. survey the scene.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{completely out of control.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{what the hell are we waiting for?}
<A>__{as they shoulder their way inside, another candidate appears holding proudly a fistful of sealed envelopes.}
<C>__{candidate}
<D>__{hot off the presses, guys. station assignments.}
<A>__{tim and everyone else but brian eagerly tear into them. brian nonchalantly shoulders up to the bar.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{a beer, willy!}
<A>__{the barkeep turns and smiles.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{well, if it isn't the littlest mccaffrey.}
<P>__{(to candidates with hose)}
<D>__{hey! you break anything with that you buy it!}
<P>__{(to brian)}
<D>__{sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. i keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{it's in my blood, willy.}
<A>__{the candidates are ripping open their assignments, exclaiming to each other: "all right! engine 117! that's a slum! they get cookers every day!". "oh no, engine 10, that's a nice neighborhood"... willy turns to the bulletin board behind him and unpins a stack of business cards.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{really. well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". i always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "assistant director, sales, aspen snowmobile tours..."}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge i need.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{uh huh. and "pioneer's pride, mobile log cabins". that was in your blood about six months wasn't it?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{management were pin heads.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{"laguna jamming, custom surfboards"?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{coffee sucked.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{and just this year, "brian's sound spectrum". your own company even. big step.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i was ahead of my time.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{you know, i've got a perfect little spot here for "brian mccaffrey, fireman"...}
<A>__{tim holds an envelope marked mccaffrey out to brian.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{aren't you even curious?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{engine 115, right?}
<C>__{tim}
<P>__{(opens it, surprised)}
<D>__{how'd you know? these are supposed to be sealed.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{lucky guess.}
<P>__{(winks)}
<D>__{and a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{you crooked son of a bitch. why 115?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{lots of fires. they promote faster there. take a look at the last lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. gotta think about your future, timmy. 115's the station.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?}
<A>__{on brian's reaction}
