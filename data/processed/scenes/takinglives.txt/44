<L>__{interior apartment day}
<A>__{it's dark, drawn shades. a small studio. reynaud and grace move tactically with drawn guns. grace enters the kitchen. light smoke. reynaud approaches the futon, a person sized shape under the blankets. reynaud whips aside the blanket. just pillows. grace checks under the sink. reynaud checks the bathroom and shower. a coffee pot smokes, sizzling sludge on the bottom. grace checks around the fridge, now satisfied no one lurks in there.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{clear.}
<A>__{grace turns off the burner. she crosses to a window, whips aside the curtains, and opens it. coughing.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{ugh. got a lung full.}
<A>__{grace looks at a glass of orange juice, a half eaten plate of food on the table.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{looks like this guy ran out in the middle of breakfast.}
<A>__{laval has entered, he stares out the window. grace looks out the window, reacts.}
<B>__{what grace sees}
<A>__{the apartment window has a perfect view of the gym parking lot where the killing occurred.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{reynaud sees that and also reacts.}
<C>__{inspector laval}
<D>__{we should get out of here. don't touch anything.}
<A>__{they back out of there.}
