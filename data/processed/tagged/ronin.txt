<A>__{a blood red screen a japanese drum starts to play, softly, but tinged with a desperate edge, growing louder, joined by other drums as a black legend scrolls up: in feudal japan, the warrior class of samurai were sworn to protect their liege lords with their lives. those samurai whose liege was killed suffered a great shame, and they were forced to wander the land, looking for work as hired swords or bandits. these masterless warriors were no longer referred to as samurai, they were known by another name: such men were called ronin. the words hang on the screen and we hold for a beat, and then the drums are cut off by a silenced gun shot: thwpfft...}

<L>__{interior a medieval cathedral night}
<A>__{it's dark, and so it takes us a minute to realize we're moving up stone spiraling stairs, up up up in what we now see is a medieval cathedral. and as we continue moving up something trickles down into frame blood. running thin, then thicker, as we continue to move up the stairs and find a body, sprawled awkwardly across the stones, arms and legs akimbo, not so much christ like as victim like. in one hand the body holds a gun he never had a chance to use. in the other a dark shape, we can't quite tell what it is. footsteps sound from above and the killer walks into frame, silenced pistol dangling at his side. we don't know him, and it's going to be a while before we see him again, but mark his face because we'll see him again. the killer now picks up the dark shape in the body's hand, and we see it's a briefcase. the killer cuffs the briefcase to his wrist and turns to two men standing behind him: subordinates. the killer shows them the briefcase.}

<A>__{the source of the ringing. we start to push slowly in one the phone booth, and as we do we hear the voice of an ugly}

<D>__{this is not football...}
<A>__{and now we're pulling back down the length of the bar. we see three men sitting seperately at the bar, paying no attention to each other. one of these men watches the game with real interest. the ugly american talks on from off screen.}
<C>__{ugly american }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...football is three hundred pound guys, they run way too fucking fast, they got helmets made of kevlar they use to spear the quarterback into the next life.}

<L>__{interior the bar}
<A>__{at the end of the bar larry, the ugly american. he's got an obvious attitude, all of it bad. but there's something about the guy he's not all bluster, and he has the look of a seasoned tough guy who knows how to get rough and tumble. he's big, and yeah he's got a gut, but the rest of him looks solid.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(talking to the air)}
<D>__{you wanna know what football is? it's hitting the other guy dirty and then spitting in his face when he's down. football is all things american, and american is a number one the absolute fucking best there is. that's what football is...}
<P>__{(he points to the tv)}
<D>__{...and that's not football.}
<A>__{the one man at the bar who's been watching the gam turns slowly and gives larry a long look. this is vincent: french, hard boiled and solid. charming when he wants to be, which isn't all that often. he gives larry a long look and then speaks }

<P>__{(to larry in perfect english)}
<D>__{football american football is a game for faggots.}
<A>__{a beat. the other two men at the bar, who seem like tough customers themselves, pretend not to watch too closely, but they're interested: what's larry going to say? for a moment it seems as if he's pissed, but then suddenly a smile breaks out on his face and he laughs heartily at vincent's remark. vincent joins in, as do the others. in particular the bartender looks relieved he's tough enough to toss a bar drunk, but these guys are in a different league. the bartender laughs with the others, happy to have avoided a confrontation as we go back to }
<L>__{exterior the street outside}
<A>__{we're almost on top of the phone booth, the phone is still ringing as a hand reaches into frame and snatches the phone from its cradle.}
<C>__{a woman's voice }
<P>__{(a touch irish accent)}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{another angle and we see a woman named deirdre on the phone: striking, dark haired, irish. she carries herself with the same professional edge as the men inside the bar. deirdre listens for a moment to the voice on the other end, and before she speaks she sense something a silhouette stands in the shadows of the bar, watching deirdre. she gives this silhouette a measure glance before speaking, her hand creeping ever so slightly towards her coat.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<A>__{the silhouette steps into a pool of light. this is sam. tough, lean, enigmatic. somebody you might trust, but whom you'd never cross. sam returns her look before he speaks.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no...}
<A>__{sam moves towards the bar, and deirdre returns to her phone conversation.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{i'm here...}
<P>__{(a beat, responding to a question)}
<D>__{no, it was nothing.}
<L>__{interior the bar a minute later}
<A>__{sam enters and by now the men inside have all come together at the bar, talking casually, recognizing they're somehow all here for a reason. with larry and vincent we see gregor, a man from eastern europe. his accent is hard to pin down, but he most definitely has one. gregor has the air of an ex spook, and that's exactly what he is. lastly we see swede blonde, muscular, and somehow blank in the face. no, he's not stupid he's a sociopath. now sam looks at the group, which grows quiet as he enters. finally, sam speaks.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{sorry i'm late...}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(a challenge)}
<D>__{what makes you think we're here to meet you?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(meeting vincent's gaze)}
<D>__{who else would you be?}
<A>__{vincent turns towards the others, including them in an expansive gesture.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{perhaps the police?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i know cops and you're no cop.}
<A>__{vincent smiles at sam's answer, satisfied, and makes room for sam to join them. vincent takes a pack of cigarettes, shakes them so that one sticks out, and offers it to sam.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{cigarette?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<A>__{vincent looks a little disappointed at this as we go }
<L>__{exterior back outside same time}
<A>__{the pay phone makes a sharp noise as it's cracked back into the cradle. deirdre stands at the phone booth, lost in thought. then, without warning deirdre spins around, pulling two guns from inside her coat. the move is fast, performed with the grace of a professional killer, as deridre scans the horizon, but nobody seems to be watching. deirdre pockets her guns and steps into the shadows of the street, the better to watch the bar and as deirdre watches the bar we watch her. pulling back from deirdre, up into the air and then moving through to }
<L>__{interior a cheap apartment same time}
<A>__{looking through a window, donw onto the street below. barely visible we can see deirdre. and staring at deirdre the watcher. somebody we're going to see periodically through the movie. right now he's only a silhouette with a well defined pair of hands. and in those hands a knife. as the watcher watches he slowly cleans his nail with the knife, methodically, perfectly. and he watches. first deirdre, and then turning his attention to the bar. he's especially interested in the bar.}
<T>__{a time cut to:}
<L>__{interior the bar later}
<A>__{the bartender is wiping out a last glass. when this is finished he looks up at a table in the back where our five guys have relocated. now the bartender and vincent exchange a look, and then the bartender takes out a set of keys and tosses them through the air and they smwack into vincent's hand. the bartender and vincent speak in rapid fire french, and then the bartender is gone. sam turns to vincent.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{he trusts you to lock up?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{let's just say he knows who i am.}
<A>__{vincent takes out his pack of cigarettes and offer them around the table again, nobody takes on. vincent seems really disappointed by this.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{anybody wanna tell me what we're waiting for?}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(lighting his cigarette)}
<D>__{the question isn't what we're waiting for... it's who.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{and who the fuck is that?}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{whoever hired us.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i got this gig through a contractor. and he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...}
<A>__{there's a kind of general look around the table a nod or grunt of acknowledgement, indicating that all of these men were hired the same way.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(continuing his thought)}
<D>__{so none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. for all we know, we're working for different people.}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{now that is an interesting proposition.}
<C>__{swede}
<D>__{how so?}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides.}
<P>__{(with great meaning)}
<D>__{your orders might be different from mine.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{what're you talking about, man? i don't understand.}
<C>__{swede}
<P>__{(quietly, but loud enough to be heard)}
<D>__{what a surprise...}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i got a surprise for you, blondie...}
<C>__{gregor}
<P>__{(sharply, as if he's used to giving orders)}
<D>__{why don't both of you shut up? larry & swede}
<P>__{(to gregor at the same time)}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{knock it off!}
<A>__{there is a beat. gregor, swede and larry look at sam, who glares them all down. lastly, sam turns and looks at vincent. the two men nod at one another, acknowledging a kind of mutual respect.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{the point remains: we could be working for different people. there's a chance for one of us...}
<P>__{(looks around the table)}
<D>__{maybe more than one of us has been paid to cross the others. i don't know about you guys, but i like to know who i'm working for. it can help prevent a great deal of...}
<P>__{(finding the right word)}
<D>__{...unpleasantness.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(patting the gun inside his cheap suit)}
<D>__{anybody tries to unpleasant me i will put two between his eyes one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.}
<A>__{from off screen we hear a new sound: laughter. another angle deirdre has entered the bar, and she's amused by this last exchange.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{it's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{who the fuck are you?}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(staring at larry)}
<D>__{the name is deirdre, and i'm running this show.}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{who are you? ira?}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(with a brittle laugh)}
<D>__{not likely. once, yeah, i was but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and i'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning. i'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.}
<A>__{deirdre hands out several thick envelopes. larry and swede open theirs and stare at the wads of franc notes stuffed inside. even gregor cracks his envelope and peaks at his money. but neither vincent nor sam takes a look.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{from here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.}
<P>__{(a quick beat, then she looks at gregor)}
<D>__{you. what do you do and what should we call you?}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{these days they they call me gregor and i'm a tech. i do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.}
<A>__{deirdre turns to sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{sam. i'm a weapons guy.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{you were a soldier, were you?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{once.}
<A>__{deirdre gives sam a look and he returns it. finally, deirdre turns to larry.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i drive and my name is larry. larry from the states.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(she turns to vincent)}
<D>__{and who are you?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i'm vincent. and i coordinate.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{coordinate what?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{things. this is my country, you know.}
<A>__{the two men exchange another look. a pecking order is developing among the group: vincent and sam are both natural leaders, and now they're feeling one another out.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(to vincent)}
<D>__{coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.}
<P>__{(vincent doesn't respond for a moment)}
<D>__{are we in sync on this, vincent?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{deirdre waits a beat, letting vincent know what she isn't any more intimidated by him than he is by her. finally, she turns to swede.}
<C>__{swede}
<D>__{they call me swede.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{who's they?}
<C>__{swede}
<D>__{everybody.}

<D>__{me?}
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{i kill.}

<L>__{interior a warehouse day}
<A>__{a paper target, in the shape of a human being, dances in place as it is riddles with gunshots, each shot hitting the target in the belly, each shot fired by larry, whose been shooting a sleek automatic pistol from which he's just discharged an entire clip. the gun is empty, larry turns to sam, who stands next in line.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(looking at the target)}
<D>__{you shoot alright.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{gets the job done.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{all in the stomach, though. your man might live.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{not for long.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{long enough to shoot back.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{is that right?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's been known to happen.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(a challenge)}
<D>__{why don't you go do better, then...}
<A>__{without a word, sam pops a new clip into the gun and shoots the lights out of several other human targets, hitting each target in a different place. one he clips between the eyes, the next in the heart, one in the groin, and then the last target he splits down the middle, firing shot after shot from the head to the groin until the target is sheared in half. larry is impressed in spite of himself.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{yeah, well... my way works too.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{my way is better.}
<A>__{in a corner of the warehouse gregor has set up a table loaded with computers and electronic whizmos. right now gregor is holding a particularly high tech type cell phone in his hands, looking at it almost lovingly.}
<C>__{deirdre }
<D>__{is it alright?}
<A>__{another angle deirdre sits nearby, looking at the cell phone.}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{it's quite satifactory.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{good, because it cost enough. there's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.}
<C>__{gregor}
<P>__{(almost caressing the phone)}
<D>__{i intend to. this phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat a link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand. with my custom hardware and this phone i can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{you sure about this?}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{i'd stake my reputation.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{but would you stake your life, that's the question...}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{in this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same.}
<A>__{from off screen we hear munching. it's larry inhaling a sandwich. a malicious look comes over swede's face, who's cleaning a pistol and sitting near larry.}
<C>__{swede}
<D>__{you should watch what you eat.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?}
<C>__{swede}
<D>__{i'm just worried about your health, larry. you could stand to shed a few pounds.}

<C>__{swede}
<P>__{(sensitive about the dumb blonde thing)}
<D>__{who you calling dumb, dickless?}
<A>__{both men eyeball one another, and then suddenly larry reaches for his piece, and as soon as he does this swede does the same thing, but before they can do anything deirdre's gun swings into frame, smashing swede in the face and dropping him to the floor. larry's mouth drops open in surprise, but it's too late: deirdre kicks him in the stomach and then rabbit punches him in the back of the neck, driving him to the ground.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(standing above them)}
<D>__{next one of you fuckers plays this game i'm going to do for you myself. i won't say it again: we don't have time for this shit! there's a clock running on this job, gentlemen, and i mean to be on schedule.}
<A>__{a tense moment as deirdre stares down at these tough guys letting them know who's in charge. a sound from off screen interrupts this moment: a door opening, as we see vincent, who stands in the door, wearing his coat and hat. he's been out somewhere, and he looks first at the squabbling men, and then at deirdre. she gives vincent a little nod a silent command that makes vincent turn to sam.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{let's go for a ride.}
<A>__{vincent and sam start off, moving towards the door, while swede and larry slowly pick themselves up off the ground.}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i don't. but the language he's speaking is universal.}

<A>__{gregor and deirdre are poised at the edge of the lake. this private dock is made completely of stone, and the drop to the water is nearly five feet. sam has reached a position where there is no right answer. still, he points his gun at gregor, who in turn shields himself with deirdre's body.}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{go ahead, shoot... shoot and kill the bitch, i don't care.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and yet you don't shoot. interesting. put down your weapon and walk away.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{don't do it, sam!}

<D>__{shoot that traitorous bitch and i will let you live.}
<A>__{the top of seamus's head explodes, finishing him off once and for all, killed by vincent, who has staggered out to make this one necessary shot. but he can go no further, and he collapses in his own blood, near death, just as gregor takes a step towards the boat and sam makes up his mind and shoots the bullet flies across the screen impact the briefcase bursts, shot open by sam and now we're in slow motion as gregor relaxes his grip on deirdre as he struggles to close the case and deirdre takes the opportunity to dive the other, into the lake, while baboom! the case explodes, a flash of phosphorescent white light that incinerates gregor and the case and whatever was inside it with an explosion that knocks sam to the ground and when the light clears gregor and the case are gone, while the explosion echoes out over the lake, booming again and again until finally there is silence. sam looks out over the lake for any sign of deirdre but there is none. and then, after we've held for a beat longer than it should be possible for her to have survived her head splits the surface and she emerges, coughing. sam reaches down to help her out.}

<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{alright? it's bloody fucking freezing in here!}
<A>__{sam pulls deirdre out of the water and then the two of them immediately turn and move towards vincent, and as they do we start to pull back on them, and now the sounds of sirens can be heard, one, then two more, and then a symphony of noise. and we're still pulling back on the chateau or what's left of it, because it's started to burn, and quickly the flames start to rise into the night, like something out of medieval times as we }

<A>__{sam waits outside a hospital room, inside of which we get a glimpse of a doctor tending to a heavily bandaged and sedated vincent. as sam waits two gendarmes and a plainclothes detective approach. the detective looks at sam for a beat, and then goes to push past him. sam blocks his way.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{i need to speak with that man.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i can't allow that.}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{call that number and ask them what you should do.}
<A>__{the detective eyeballs the number suspiciously. five minutes later the detective hangs up a nearby wall phone and then looks over at sam in disgust. without another word, the detective signals to the two gendarmes, and all three men exit. now the doctor, a beautiful french woman, comes up and speaks to him in french and the amazing thing is that sam speaks back. everything in subtitled.}

<D>__{you don't owe me a goddamned thing, vincent, and you know it. you stepped in front of a bullet for me.}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i don't know. nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us. there's probably a couple of guys back at the company who know, but i don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.}

<D>__{what happened to it?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{gone. destroyed.}

<P>__{(sighs, then a beat)}

<A>__{sam turns for the door but vincent has one last thing to say.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{sam, when gregor had deirdre by the lake, you could have killed the two of them with one shot. you could have had the package, finished the job. but you didn't, you sacrificed the job to save her life. why?}
<A>__{same has to think about this for a second, and his answer reveals just how full circle he's come.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's what you would have done.}

<D>__{so where do you go from here?}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{i don't know. i was thinking...maybe the three of us might partner up guns for hire, that sort of thing.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i'm up for that...}
<A>__{the two of them turn to sam, but he shakes his head.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{not me. you work too often with the same people and you become friends clouds your judgement.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{come off it, sam if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{she's got a pointerior}

<C>__{punk}
<D>__{this is for seamus!}
<A>__{boom! the punk pulls the trigger, a blast of fire as sam's gun is already out, two quick shots squeezed off and the punk is capped twice in the head, dead, sailing away on the ferry which never stops as the cafe goes wild, customers running, screaming, waiters dropping their trays. but sam doesn't run, and neither does vincent. sam stands, stunned by what he sees deirdre lies on the ground, hit full on in the chest: she's dead. a beat of pure silence broken by sirens in the distance, but quickly growing closer. now vincent looks at deirdre's corpse, then at sam, who is unable to move. for maybe the first time in his professional career, sam is staggered by the loss of a life. vincent gently takes sam's arm.}

<P>__{(soft yet urgent)}

<P>__{(a little louder, bordering desperation)}
<D>__{let's go!!}
<A>__{vincent literally drags sam away and now the sirens have arrived, followed quickly by the gendarmes, who come running into the cafe but it's empty except for deirdre's body. now the street above the river sam and vincent are running through patchy fog, vincent leading the way, and now we're closer on vincent as he runs and runs and runs until he feels he's far enough away from the scene of the crime to relax. he collapses against a stone wall, chest heaving, shaking out two cigarettes, one for himself and one for sam.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(thrusting the cigarettes out to sam)}
<D>__{doctor's orders...}
<A>__{but sam isn't there to take the cigarette vincent looks around, trying to see what happened to his friend, but the fog has covered any sign of sam. vincent stands there, stunned, alone, the cigarettes in an outstretched hand that slowly falls back to vincent's side as he realizes that sam has left him on purpose. then vincent lights both cigarettes at the saem time and throws one of them over the stone wall the glowing cigarette arcs through the air until it lands in the river where it extinguishes with a hiss.}
<C>__{vincent }
<D>__{goodbye, sam...}
<A>__{back at the cafe the gendarmes have secured the scene (there isn't much to secure since everyone has run away). a majority of cops surround deirdre's dead body, but one gendarme wanders around the cafe, looking about, and then he sees something on the street above a shape in the fog. the wind blows and the fog clears for a second, and we see that it's sam. getting one last look at deirdre. quickly the gendarme points sam out but as he does the wind continues to blow and the fog swallows sam. seconds later the fog clears again, and when it does sam is gone.}
