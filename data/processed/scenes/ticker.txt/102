<D>__{reilly, he's got enough to do it.}
<A>__{reilly leaves the cover of his car and scurries along the side of the alley, escaping swan's view. swan rages. he moves around the van, pulling mary along. swan sprays a flurry of bullets over reilly's head... reilly dives for cover as bullets rip the alley wall inches from his face. swan whirls and sprays the bomb squad van, dropping t.j. with a shot to the leg. bev drops to his aid. glass grimaces, having been hit in the shoulder. reilly moves forward about to take the shot.}
