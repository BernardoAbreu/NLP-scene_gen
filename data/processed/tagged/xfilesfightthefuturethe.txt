<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior snowscape}
<A>__{a blinding white screen, under which we hear an ominous low end dolby thx big screen rumble. we're not in 19" television land anymore, toto. as the rumble builds, two black figures appear on what now has resolved into a distant horizon. from their movements we can shortly see that the figures are men. moving along a windswept ice sheet in an otherwise featureless land. a legend appears: north texas, 35,000 b.c.}
<B>__{closer on the two men}
<A>__{continuing toward us, we can now see that they are dressed in crude garments made of animal skins. if we squint we can see their hair is long, their jutting foreheads significant of primitive homo sapiens. they continue toward us, the wind beating against them, camera is craning down to the snow that lies before them. to large three toed tracks.}
<B>__{following the primitives}
<A>__{as they track the three toed prints to a rocky crevice in the hard pack ice. the prints stop here, and so do the men. dropping down into the crevice in pursuit of their quarry.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior ice cave}
<A>__{dark in here, except where the sunlight penetrates the thick, glassy ice walls. the silhouettes of the primitives stark against the glistening cavern. the sound of flint being struck, then a torch catches fire, illuminating their faces. and:}
<B>__{a creature}
<A>__{deeper in the cave. fleeing the light and the men. we get only a brief glimpse of it in the torch light, seeing that it moves upright on two legs and has gray, dinosaur like skin. and large black eyes. but it moves quickly enough away that any other identifying feature is lost in the deeper shadows.}
<B>__{the primitives}
<A>__{removing crude weapons made of sharpened bone from under their thick fur garments, and scrabbling into the constricting cavern, giving chase. following them as they moves with animal like agility through the tightening space. predatory hunters. their torchlight catching:}
<B>__{the creature}
<A>__{as it disappears into a tight opening in a smaller crevice leading off the main one. the primitives entering frame after a moment, only a few steps behind. the lead primitive dropping to the cave floor, pulling himself into this same tight fissure in pursuit. splitting off from his partner who exits frame still on the run.}
<L>__{interior smaller ice cave high angle down}
<A>__{the fiery torch comes through first, held by the lead man. throwing dancing shadows on the walls of what appears to be a box cavern.}
<B>__{close on lead primitive}
<A>__{rising quickly to his feet. not seeing what the torch illuminates just behind him: the face of a dead primitive man, his body frozen into the ice. he does finally notice this, turning to see it, when he's}
<B>__{attacked viciously from behind.}
<A>__{the torch falls to the floor so that the fight is difficult to see, but it is loud and cruel. the creature squealing wildly as the grunts of the primitive now turn to the sounds of painful struggle. until:}
<B>__{the second primitive man}
<A>__{suddenly appears, driving his bone weapon into the body of the creature. again and again, until the creature is driven away into the shadows. the second man grabs the torch now, not to see if his hunting mate has survived, but in pursuit of the creature. in the light we see that he and his weapon are covered with spatters of oily black blood. as is the first primitive whose body lies heaving on the floor. the second primitive stepping over his hunting mate, stalking the creature into the shadows, where it has collapsed. the torch finally landing, for the first time, on its face. when the torchlight hits its face, the creature attacks. but the primitive prevails. he drops his torch and dispatches the already wounded creature with strong hard stabs of his weapon, one of which penetrates the creature's eye.}
<B>__{low angle on the dead creature}
<A>__{the torch, which lies on the ground, illuminates the dead creature's face. its wounds are flowing with the oily black blood, which, oddly now, begins to pool. as if it has intelligence, sentience. pooling and traveling into a fissure in the cave floor. and disappearing.}
<B>__{angle on the second primitive}
<A>__{watching this, unknowing. his chest heaving from the fight, as the spots of oily black blood which have spattered onto him begin to crawl. crawling toward his eyes and mouth. causing him to let out grunts of fear. which are the sounds we hear as the camera slowly cranes up past the struggling primitive to the roof of the cave, where the dancing shadows of the torch fade away: with the sounds of struggle. moving into darkness and silence. but only for a moment. until: sunshine breaks through the roof of the cave present}
<B>__{day}
<A>__{along with the spade of a shovel. and then the earthen cave ceiling gives way and a boy wearing nikes and an old t shirt falls through it. falling past camera. we hear a yell, then a thud, and a clattering of the shovel that's fallen in with him. then a pained}
<B>__{gasping.}
<A>__{then several heads appear in the opening. these are boys of ten to eleven, staring down into the cave. hot sunlight blazing in. we have traveled far, far forward in time.}
<D>__{2nd boy hey, stevie. you okay?}
<L>__{interior cave present day}
<B>__{their pov of stevie}
<A>__{on the floor below covered with dirt, in his nose and mouth. spitting out. (all these boys have texas in their voices.)}

<P>__{(straining)}
<D>__{....the wind knocked out of me.}
<A>__{this draws no sympathy from above, only laughter.}
<B>__{the boys up above}
<A>__{staring excitedly.}
<D>__{3rd boy looks like a cave or something. 2nd boy what's down there, stevie? anything?}
<B>__{over the boys above}
<A>__{stevie has gotten up, moving out of the patch of sunlight. disappearing from view for a moment. then reappearing, still spitting out dirt. but holding:}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{human skull.}
<A>__{one side partially missing from the cranium. but it brings whoops of delight from the boys above.}
<D>__{3rd boy toss it up here, dude.}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{no way, buttwipe. i found it. it's mine.}
<B>__{angle up on stevie}
<A>__{the other boys looking down at him. stevie looking at the skull. strangely, the light shines through it. it is milky, opaque, as if it's bone that's turned somehow glassy in places. then:}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{anyways, there's bones all over the place down here.}
<A>__{stevie looks down at his feet. camera following his look down to where there are indeed more human bones. and something else. he takes a couple of steps in place, standing in a familiar black, oily substance which is climbing up his tennis shoe from the rock floor, over the edge of the shoe and down into the shoe itself. then the skull drops in the frame, clattering on the hard floor of the cave. camera slowly rising up from stevie's shoes following subcutaneous worms which have begun locomoting aggressively up his legs. as his whole body is wracked by a shivering seizure of some kind. camera rises, following the path of the worms as they move up the legs of his shorts. some appearing on his bare arms, but the great majority continuing up to stevie's neck, toward his face. stevie stands paralyzed. letting out guttural sounds not dissimilar to when the wind was knocked out of him.}
<P>__{3rd boy (o.s.)}
<D>__{hey, stevie....}
<A>__{but stevie cannot answer him. camera continuing up to the boys above. looking down at their friend. their eyes go wide.}
<D>__{2nd boy you okay?}
<A>__{but what they see next answers that question for them.}
<B>__{their pov of stevie}
<A>__{his face suddenly alive with the subcutaneous worms. moving toward his eyes which begin filling with black oil. looking much now like alien eyes.}
<B>__{close on the boys above}
<A>__{freaked by what they see. and doing what any kid would do now.}
<D>__{3rd boy hey, man. let's get outta here.}
<A>__{and they do. bolting from the hole in the top of the cave. camera pushing up through this hole to reveal we are:}
<L>__{exterior small dirt field northern texas day}
<A>__{in a dirt hole that was being dug by the three kids. rising up out of the hole to reveal the parched dirt patch where three kids are running away from us, as fast as their feet will take them. toward a new housing tract (five floorplans to choose from, including the model home.) disappearing into the neighborhood. a legend appears: north texas, 1998. camera continues rising above the rooftops to see the surrounding expanse of empty texas flatland. and in the distance, the dallas skyline. as camera settles, there are a few moments of nothing but the sound of the wind gently whistling across the landscape. in which we bury a short time cut.}
<L>__{exterior neighborhood northern texas day}
<A>__{then we hear it, before we see it: fire engines pulling into the neighborhood, sirens wailing. camera dropping again as the lead engine pulls up. firemen are hopping off, moving to the hole the boys dug. low angle up from below ground level, in the dugout}
<B>__{hole}
<A>__{two firemen carrying a ladder clamber down past camera, three others appearing on their heels. the other two firemen clamber down, too. the captain at the edge of the hole watching them. holding a radio.}

<L>__{interior cave continuous}

<B>__{their pov}
<A>__{stevie's feet are just visible on the floor of the cave, a short distance away. resume firemen low angle they start cautiously toward stevie. camera finding their feet. tracking through the same oily, black substance we saw bleeding from the creature thirty five thousand years ago. as they move into the shadows, we hold on the substance....and see it move. it's alive.}

<T>__{neighbors:}
<A>__{concerned parents, kids, including stevie's friends. they're held at a distance by the remaining firemen. everyone turning their concerned gazes skyward. looking at: a med evac chopper coming off the sun setting horizon. moving toward us at high speed. the whop, whop of its blade soon shaking the neighborhood as it banks in and around and hovers just over the dirt field. landing gently on the parched hard scrabble. the side door flies open and five haz mat rescue paramedics jump out carrying a bubble litter. camera pans them to the dirt hole past the fire captain. the haz mat paramedics moving down into the hole. the fire captain watches this, then stares toward dr. ben bronschweig (in shirtsleeves, tie), exiting the chopper, following up the rear. the captain meeting him in route.}
<C>__{bronschweig}
<P>__{(over the chopper)}
<D>__{keep those people back. get them out of here.}
<C>__{fire captain}
<P>__{(to his men)}
<D>__{move them all back.}
<P>__{(dogging bronschweig)}
<D>__{i sent four men down after the boy. they're not responding.}
<A>__{dr. bronschweig's focus is elsewhere, though. he's making a bee line to the earthen hole where young stevie is being pulled out and lifted into an enclosed quarantine bubble litter by the rescue squad. bronschweig watches with great concern. getting a good look now at stevie's paralyzed body as it passes him.}
<B>__{angle on chopper}
<A>__{as stevie's body is loaded aboard, the side door is slid shut. the engine throttles up and the chopper takes flight again, almost as quickly as it arrived. the prop wash blowing:}
<B>__{dr. bronschweig}
<A>__{and the gathering crowd. bronschweig watches the chopper bank away, then turns his look to:}
<B>__{the neighborhood}
<A>__{where a series of unmarked cargo vans, trucks are rolling in. a fleet of vehicles, driven by what looks like military personnel. most conspicuously two white unmarked tanker trucks. (there are no markings on these vehicles.)}

<C>__{fire captain}
<D>__{what about my men?}
<C>__{dr. bronschweig}
<P>__{(brusquely)}
<D>__{we're doing all we can.}
<A>__{and he moves off toward the approaching trucks where the military personnel are pulling out tents, tent poles, scientific equipment. leaving the captain to wonder what the hell's going on. watching the first of many refrigeration units being unloaded. the personnel carrying it paying him no mind as they blow past him. moving right to camera and plunging us into black. hold. then over black, a familiar sound again. the sound of a chopper auguring in. as we fade up: , revealing we are:}
<L>__{exterior top of a skyscraper day}
<A>__{the chopper is banking over the side of the building, preparing to touch down on the rooftop where fifteen fbi agents in dark id windbreakers are standing. a legend appears: federal building, dallas, texas. one week}
<B>__{later.}
<A>__{the chopper touches down and, again, the side door is thrown open. but now only one man exits: special agent in charge (s.a.c.) darius michaud. michaud moves with the measured pace of authority, approaching the waiting fbi agents. one of whom steps up.}
<C>__{fbi agent}
<D>__{we've evacuated the building and been through it bottom to top. no trace of an explosive device or anything resembling one.}

<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{s.a.c. michaud}
<D>__{well, take them through again.}
<A>__{this is given as a non negotiable order, to the somewhat weary fbi man. who turns back to his charges, michaud does not register this attitude, though. something else has caught his attention. causing him to walk to the edge of the building. camera following him, seeing what he sees now. on an adjacent skyscraper is what appears to be an fbi agent in an id windbreaker exiting onto the roof. camera continuing around into a close up profile of s.a.c michaud. staring at this, his jaw set. he doesn't like what he sees. and what he sees is:}

<D>__{i've just climbed twelve floors. i'm hot and thirsty and i'm wondering, to be honest, what i'm doing here.}
<C>__{mulder }
<D>__{you're looking for a bomb.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{i know that. but the threat was called in for the federal building across the street.}
<C>__{mulder }
<D>__{i think they have that covered.}
<B>__{we are tracking with scully.}
<C>__{scully}
<P>__{(impatience)}
<D>__{mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. the rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. if you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. if we don't act in accordance with that data if you ignore it as we have done the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. lives could be lost }

<D>__{now what?}
<C>__{mulder}
<P>__{(suddenly nervous)}
<D>__{it's locked?}

<C>__{scully}
<D>__{so much for anticipating the unforeseen...}
<A>__{scully squints into the sun, staring at mulder. but he's quick on the draw, and realizes what she's up to. he grabs for the door and... it opens. looking to scully whose hard look of mock scolding has become a smirking smile.}
