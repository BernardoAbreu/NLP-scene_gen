<LOC>__{EXT. FRONT YARD.  DAY.}
<ACTION>__{Slow motion. Armed troops in black uniforms pour out of unmarked vans and swarm across a lawn in a middle class residential neighborhood. Yuppie neighbours look on in shock, confused. Two of the troops carry a battering ram to the front door of a white two-storey house. A leashed Rottweiler snarls and barks. In position, their comrades point M-16s into first-floor windows, ready to be ambushed. Pan into a window in the kitchen. An attractive woman in her thirties is making breakfast. Now, in regular motion, the battering ram breaks open the front door. The woman, startled, drops her spatula.}
