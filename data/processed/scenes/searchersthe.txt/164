<L>__{exterior open country full shot ethan and martin moving}
<A>__{shot early winter day they are riding down a slight grade beyond which (we can assume) is the comanche camp.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{what i heard back there was that a band o' hostile nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago...}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(excitedly)}
<D>__{think it might be...?}
<A>__{he breaks and both turn as look rides over the hill on a little spotted indian pony, with her squaw bag slung up behind her and her blanket over the saddle. she closes the gap between them.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{what's she followin' for?}
<A>__{look smiles shyly at martin.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{look, i changed my mind... you can keep your blanket.}
<A>__{he gestures for her to go back.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{go on back...}
<A>__{she stares and then dutifully wheels her horse. martin and ethan face front again. look wheels her horse again and is right with them. martin stops exasperated.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{look... you don't understand...}
<P>__{(he waves her away)}
<D>__{i don't want it.}
<A>__{look just sits.}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(explosively)}
<D>__{you don't understand, ya chunkhead! you didn't buy any blanket! ya bought her!}

<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(a wail)}
<D>__{oh no! tell her she's got to go back...}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{and have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?... no sir! come on, mrs. pauley...}
<A>__{look smiles and sets her horse in motion as ethan moves ahead. martin's face is a mask of comic despair as he gives up. he is mouthing the words }
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{mrs... pauley?}
<A>__{and ethan suddenly breaks into song; to the tune of "skip to my lou:"}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{i got another gal purtier'n you. i got another gal purtier'n you. i got another gal purtier'n you. skip to my lou, my darlin'.}
