<A>__{a christmas tree! the corny little tree with plastic needles, blinking lights, and topped with a super cute angel is only a foot high. it's sitting on church's cluttered desk next to framed photographs of church's wife and children. we can hear mekum's voice badly transmitted...}
<C>__{mekum }
<D>__{sorry to disturb the tranquillity of outer space on christmas eve, but i'm off to the caribbean in a few hours, and i wanted to make sure you'd got the transmission on the security sweep.}
<A>__{glowering at the monitor where mekum's badly transmitted video image is quivering and distorting, church waves the print out map he's holding in his hand, a map showing hundreds of little dots against a vast field, stars and moons in the vast sea of space. rubrick and sloan watch as church addresses mekum's image indignantly.}
<C>__{church}
<D>__{we got it all right. this is an outpost here, not the third army! you've got us securing thirty four locations and erecting monitor units in one month and }
<C>__{mekum}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{piece of cake, guys! these are totally remote, totally uninhabited territories. all you do is set down, send out a patrol purely as a formality, then have those veterans of yours put up an a type unmanned monitoring unit. you should be on about number twenty five by the time i get back from my vacation...}

<D>__{what if we do run into people... say squatters or refugees?}

<D>__{my advice would be to..."avoid paperwork."}
<C>__{church}
<D>__{eliminate them, you mean.}
<C>__{mekum}
<D>__{well, no one's out there, but officially these are "hostile zones." therefore you'd be within your rights to classify anyone as "hostile," i think. but i repeat, you should be worried about boredom, not action. any other questions before i go?}

<D>__{down there...is it snowing?}
<C>__{mekum}
<P>__{(a smirk)}
<D>__{not in the caribbean. have a good christmas, guys. see you when i get back.}
<A>__{mekum's image disappears and the video screen goes blank, leaving a glum silence broken only by the drumming of the rain on the roof. church moodily strolls toward his desk, and his eyes go to the photographs. his wife and children smile back at him from the pictures. just then sloan taps him, and be turns to see her handing him a cup full of amber liquid.}
