<L>__{interior scud's workshop day}
<A>__{the workshop proper. scud is working at whistler's old lathe, bopping his head along to music which is playing on a nearby tv. the them song to speed racer. now he's wearing a ron jeremy t shirt that says "daddy".}
<C>__{tv }
<D>__{here he comes, here comes speed racer! he's a demon on wheels. he's gaining on you so you better look alive. he's busy revving up the powerful mach five }
<A>__{whistler cocks an incredulous eyebrow at blade, who has fallen in beside him. scud kills the lathe and approaches.}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{whistler. cool beans. nice to meet you, man. heard a lot. i'm josh frohmeyer. you can call me scud, though. that's what most people do.}
<A>__{scud offers his hand. whistler doesn't take it. scud shoots an uneasy glance at blade, raising an eyebrow in question. is whistler okay, or not? blade nods. whistler moves over to the charger which has its hood up.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{tell me something, skid }
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{scud.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{whatever }
<P>__{(checking the motor)}
<D>__{what'd you do to the charger?}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{the pimp mobile? just made a few after market modifications. nitrous oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{fuck yeah. whole package'll crank this betty up another three hundred horsepower.}
<C>__{whistler}
<P>__{(cutting him off)}
<D>__{and you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.}
<A>__{whistler just looks to blade and shakes his head.}
<C>__{whistler }
<D>__{where'd you dig up this shit bird anyway?}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{look, what's your problem?}
<A>__{whistler gets in scud's face. scud looks to blade for help, but he just watches, letting the two of them sort things out.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{my problem, shitbird, is that i tried to blow my fucking head off and wound up sucking blood clots for the last year and a half! now you're standing there choking your chicken like we're all walking around some fucking candy ass vampire sitcom!}
<A>__{scud attempts to show some balls, but stammers all the same.}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{hey, you think i don't know what's at stake here? we practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass! and for what?}
<C>__{whistler}
<P>__{(grabs scud's shirt)}
<D>__{our operation?! our operation?! i built this operation, you fucking turd stain.}
<A>__{just then, however, an alarm starts beeping. scud checks a display as blade readies his mach.}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{motion sensors. looks like zone three.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{human?}
<A>__{scud checks a series of thermal signature displays.}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{body temp's fifty so i will guess suck head.}
<A>__{scud looks to a bank of security monitors the views break into static as a figure rushes past them. he tries a few keyboard commands.}
<C>__{scud }
<D>__{i don't understand, i'm not getting anything on the surveillance cams.}
<A>__{whistler makes a few adjustments on the nearest monitor.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{they're fried. whoever's out there is using magnesium flares. seems like they've got your security system stopped out pretty well.}
<A>__{whistler moves to a rack of weaponry. as he reaches for car}
