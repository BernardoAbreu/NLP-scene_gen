<D>__{joe, how come the fluorescents are on? can we kill that, please? (to syd) jesus i put this lamp here for you 'cause i thought it'd be better for you. there's a wire here. they're scared because people hang themselves but i know you're too smart for that. where's the table and chair? there's no bed here? it's like a fucking asylum. joe, is everybody off today? jesus christ it's scary. maybe i wanted to scare you. i don't know. maybe it was my idea. maybe i'm a little off the beaten path you know? i don't know. you look dehydrated. here, want to try some tea? oh yeah, your lips are all chapped. (re: tea) it's herbal. my favorite.}
<A>__{richie bends down to edith who is sitting on the floor in the corner and hands her the cup and saucer. she lifts the cup but her hand is shaking almost violently as she raises the cup to her lips.}
<C>__{richie dimaso }
<D>__{i know you think look at me. hey. edith.}
<C>__{richie dimaso }
<D>__{i know you think irv loves you. i know you think you know him that he sees the world as a cold, dark place, and he cares about nobody but very few people on his short list: his son, his father, rosalyn, and you. and you think you're at the top of that list. but what if you're not. what if you're not even on the list at all? he'd be in here right now if he took the check.}
<A>__{she thinks about this. she trembles.}
<C>__{richie dimaso }
<D>__{he'd be in here right now if he took the check. but no, you did. god, it's, it's so clear to me. it's so crazy it's clear to me, but it's not clear to you. he uses you, edith, to protect himself. to protect his son and his wife in long island. no? yes. he put a ring on her finger, he adopted her son. they have huge house, they have two cars. what does she do all day? i will tell you what she does she plays with her nails, she watches t.v., and she spends your money, the money that you make.}
<A>__{edith stares at richie, taking this in.}
<C>__{richie dimaso }
<D>__{i don't like that you're in jail while he's going free. i don't like any of that. i want to help you. all the razzle dazzle that he does, it's not good. it's not real. it's fake. it's not real. who you are is who you are, between you and god. you and your soul. that's what matters. that's what counts. that's what i'm about. and that's what i see in you. tell me you didn't feel it the first time we saw each other. am i crazy? i don't think so. i'm not supposed to be talking like this, but i don't care, i break the rules.}
<A>__{edith looks at richie in silence as she thinks about what he's saying.}
<C>__{richie dimaso }
<D>__{okay, edith? edith. i want to help you. i like you. (whispers) i like you. (dead serious) i like you.}
