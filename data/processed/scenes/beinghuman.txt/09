<L>__{exterior rocks dusk}
<A>__{it is dusk now. we find hector waking from a fitful sleep behind some rocks. he sits up and takes in his surroundings. his face hardens as awareness of his pre dicament returns. he stands up and then crouching low, moves off down the hill.}
<L>__{exterior valley dusk}
<A>__{hector has returned to the area of the tree. he slows down some distance away and just in time. he sees a figure standing beneath the tree. he moves forward to the protection of some rocks, and watches. he is close enough to hear the voice of the solitary raider, although he doesn't understand the words. the raider looks up into the branches and talks in a friendly, persuasive way.}
<C>__{raider}
<D>__{it's too cold to spend all night up there. we've got a fire at the beach. food, too.}
<A>__{there is no response from the tree. the raider coaxes again.}
<C>__{raider}
<D>__{come on! your mother's down there. she's happy... she's warm, too... and full... she wants to see you... she sent me...}
<A>__{his friendly tone of voice has an effect. there is movement in the branches. hector can see the dark shapes of his two children clambering down. the raider stretches out his arms and helps the boy to the ground. then he reaches up for the girl, catches her as she drops and keeps her in his arms. he laughs in a comforting way.}
<C>__{raider}
<D>__{that was easy, eh? you're half asleep already, little girl. i will carry you.}
<A>__{hector watches the raider and his children move slowly off, down the hillside, the raider carrying the girl in one arm and holding the boy's hand. they almost look like a family.}
