<L>__{exterior black guys' van day}
<A>__{we see tyrone grimace at the sound of the shotgun.}
<L>__{interior bookies day}
<A>__{sol pulls himself together and marches up to the hole in the wall that the shot created and pokes the gun through.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{drop the screen now! you just seen what it did to this wall so think what it could do to you.}
<A>__{pauline knows she has lost this one and looks genuinely scared.}
<C>__{pauline}
<P>__{(to the other clerk)}
<D>__{do it. . . . i said do it.}
<A>__{the screen comes down with a thud. this means that vince comes down with just as serious a thud. he lets out another groan.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{how you doing vince?}
<A>__{a weakened voice retorts.}
<C>__{vinny}
<D>__{how do i look like i am doing you fucking idiot? i would be doing a lot better if you would stop using my name.}
<A>__{consoled that his colleague is not dead it's back to business for sol. he raises the gun and pulls his fiercest face.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{now fill this bag...}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{all bets are off.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{i am not here to make a fuckin bet.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{all bets are off.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{are you fuckin stupid? i don't care if the fuckin bets are off. i want...}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{if all bets are off then there can't be any money, can there?}
<A>__{there is a pause. sol knows he's fucked. she points to a black board that clearly states "all bets are off"}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{i ain't buying that.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i ain't fuckin selling it, it's a fact! . ''.}
<A>__{pause}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{well, what have you got?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{nothing, i mean we got a few coins but no notes.}
<C>__{vinny}
<D>__{can we just get out of here please. i am not feeling too funny.}
<A>__{sol's temper does have a limit.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{well i am not feeling too fucking funny myself, let me tell you!}
<A>__{sol points at the man on the floor who is carrying the case.}
<C>__{sol }
<D>__{let me see your hands.}
<A>__{the man holds his hands up. he has got a perfect set of five fingers on both hands. sol puts his head in his hands. pauline and the other clerk put two bags full of coins on the counter. sol picks them up and frowns, he's not happy with a bag full of change. he puts his gun down and starts to rifle through the bag. pauline can see vinny's pistol on the counter, dropped after his encounter with the screen.}
<C>__{sol }
<D>__{copper coins? what do you mean copper fuckin coins?}
<A>__{pauline sees her opportunity and grabs the pistol. sol .goes for it too, but he's beaten to it. sol ducks, pulling vince with him, pauline lets out a series of shots in their direction, sol counter blasts over the top of the counter. the security screen comes flying back up.}
<C>__{vinny}
<D>__{get me out of here now sol.}
<A>__{vinny does sound convincingly desperate.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{we're going vin.}
<A>__{he grabs the bag of copper coins, grabs vince and marches towards the double'doors. they open the first set and then they try to open the second. they push the door nothing happens. there is no going back. sol starts to kick the glass door, but it doesn't budge. with panic rising swiftly, sol doesn't fuck around he takes aim with the handgun and fires, the bullet shatters the glass but it doesn't break through, and the bullet now ricochets off both glass doors shattering bullet proof glass all around them. vinny's panic filled eyes attempt to follow its trajectory. sol is unaware of the ricochet and before vin has time to warn him, sol fires another bullet. now he observes the problem and waits for the inevitable. the bullet tears through the bag of coins, which then empties its contents at vin's and sol's feet. eventually the bullet hits poor vince in the thigh. sol sinks to the floor, he has given up. amongst the yells emanating from vince we can hear sol's pathetic and desperate whimpering.}
<C>__{sol }
<D>__{no security, eh?}
<A>__{at that point tyrone appears and pushes the door open. the door was open the whole time only sol was pushing it the}
<D>__{,,}
<A>__{wrong way.}
<C>__{tyrone}
<D>__{what the fuck are you two doing?}
<A>__{they stumble out into the street. vinny is in big trouble. they throw him into the van. just as sol gets into the back, we hear kicking noises on metal from the van behind. tyrone pulls out. and the rear doors of the van behind them fly open. franky four fingers appears from the back of this van. he was locked in due to the fact that the black guys' van was blocking his exit.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{tyrone get us outta here.}
<A>__{tyrone takes an interest in the man from the van (ie franky) seeing that he's carrying a case and the case is connected to his wrist.}
<C>__{sol }
<D>__{i said, get us outta here tyrone!}
