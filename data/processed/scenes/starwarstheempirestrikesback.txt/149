<L>__{interior millennium falcon main hold area}
<A>__{threepio whistles and beeps a strange dialect into the control panel in front of him. the control panel whistles back a few mystifying beeps.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{oh, where is artoo when i need him?}
<A>__{han enters the hold area and kneels on the floor near the control box.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{sir, i don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. i believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. i'm afraid you'll have to replace it.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{well, of course i will have to replace it.}
<A>__{he hands a wire coil up to chewie who is working near the ceiling.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{here! and chewie...}
<A>__{chewie brings his head back through the trap door in the ceiling and whines. han glances back at threepio, then speaks quietly to chewie so only he can hear.}
<C>__{han}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{... i think we'd better replace the negative power coupling.}
<A>__{leia finishes welding the valves she has been working on and attempts to reengage the system by pulling a lever attached to the valve. it doesn't budge. han notices her struggle, and moves to help her. she rebuffs him.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{hey, your worship, i'm only trying to help.}
<C>__{leia}
<P>__{(still struggling)}
<D>__{would you please stop calling me that?}
<A>__{han hears a new tone in her voice. he watches her pull on the lever.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{sure, leia.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{oh, you make it so difficult sometimes.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{i do, i really do. you could be a little nicer, though.}
<P>__{(he watches her reaction)}
<D>__{come on, admit it. sometimes you think i'm all right.}
<A>__{she lets go of the lever and rubs her sore hand.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{occasionally...}
<P>__{(a little smile, haltingly)}
<D>__{... when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.}
<C>__{han}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{scoundrel? scoundrel? i like the sound of that.}
<A>__{with that, han takes her hand and starts to massage it.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{stop that.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{stop what?}
<A>__{leia is flushes, confused.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{stop that! my hands are dirty.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{my hands are dirty, too. what are you afraid of?}
<C>__{leia}
<P>__{(looking right into his eyes)}
<D>__{afraid?}
<A>__{han looks at her with a piercing look. he's never looked more handsome, more dashing, more confident. he reaches out slowly and takes leia's hand again from where it is resting on a console. he draws it toward him.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{you're trembling.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{i'm not trembling.}
<A>__{then with an irresistible combination of physical strength and emotional power, the space pirate begins to draw leia toward him... very slowly.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{you like me because i'm a scoundrel. there aren't enough scoundrels in your life.}
<A>__{leia is now very close to han and as she speaks, her voice becomes an excited whisper, a tone completely in opposition to her words.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{i happen to like nice men.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{i'm a nice man.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{no, you're not. you're...}
<A>__{he kisses her now, with slow, hot lips. he takes his time, as though he had forever, bending her body backward. she has never been kissed like this before, and it almost makes her fainterior when he stops, she regains her breath and tries to work up some indignation, but finds it hard to talk. suddenly, threepio appears in the doorway, speaking excitedly.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{sir, sir! i've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.}
<A>__{han turns slowly, icily, from their embrace.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{thank you. thank you very much.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.}
<A>__{the moment spoiled, han marches out after threepio.}
