<B>__{the remains of an old station}
<A>__{fifteen feet below.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{i've never been this deep. this area here is the old armory station. they built it in the 40's. ran out of money half way through...}
<A>__{it's like grand central's dead little brother. tiled mosaic walls, columns, monumental arches. spaces for shops. a group of abandoned turn of the century subway cars on parallel tracks.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{okay, the fat lady's singing. time to go.}
<A>__{everything is gray with dust.}
<C>__{peter }
<P>__{(to josh)}
<D>__{i want a team in here by six tonight, hands and knees with toothpicks...}
<A>__{leonard squints down at the planks of the scaffolding. a nymph big as the one seen earlier emerges from a pile of nearby feces as if it were part of the mound. keeping his eyes fixed on the insect, leonard coolly bends down, picks up a rock.}
<B>__{peter}
<A>__{putting the last sample boxes into the back pack, looks up and sees}
<B>__{leonard}
<A>__{step onto the scaffolding, raising the rock to crush the nymph.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{don't!!}
<A>__{smash! leonard tosses the rock at the insect, crushing it. peter rushes to the insect's corpse on the scaffolding.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{did you see the size of that thing?!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{look what you did! you stupid sonofa }
<A>__{a creak from the scaffolding at their combined weight. leonard grabs peter, tries to pull him from the scaffolding. creeeeaaaaak! the entire scaffolding gives way! buckling diagonally... ...taking peter and leonard with it... crash! both peter and leonard are thrown to the ground of the station below. the scaffolding falls around them.}
<B>__{josh}
<A>__{rushes forward.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{peter!}
<B>__{peter and leonard}
<A>__{stir in the wreckage. peter rises shakily. he puts his glasses on. one of the lenses is badly smashed.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{it's okay. i'm all right.}
<A>__{he tries to help leonard up; leonard knocks his hand away.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{get the hell away from me!}
<A>__{peter looks up at josh.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{he's all right, too.}
<A>__{leonard brushes himself off, checks out his walkie talkie. it's been broken in the fall, a tangle of plastic and wires. he curses under his breath. peter checks the wall for a handhold. but there's only smooth tile and dust.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{oh, that's gonna work.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you got a better way up?}
<A>__{leonard removes his badge, tosses it up to josh.}

<D>__{h how do i get...?}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{way we came. take the first tunnel to your right...}
<A>__{leonard's voice echoes off the cavernous walls. josh hurriedly writes it down in his notebook.}
<C>__{leonard }
<D>__{go left. go left again till you hit the fork... then right again. you got that?}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{i think so. one right, two lefts...}
