<L>__{interior basement evening}
<A>__{graham comes down the last few steps and enters the basement.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{we forgot our foil helmets!}
<A>__{graham closes the door behind him. it has no lock.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{we need something to wedge against the doorknob.}
<A>__{the basement is lined with metal shelves. the shelves are cluttered with all sorts of canned goods, extension cords, cleaning supplies, decorations, outdoor tools. merrill rummages through the shelves frantically.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{they'll read our minds!}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{you're scaring your sister.}
<C>__{bo}
<D>__{i'm already scared.}
<A>__{graham puts his ear to the door and listens.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{merrill }
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{i'm looking!}
<A>__{merrill moves to another set of shelves. he starts knocking things to the ground.}
<C>__{morgan}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{they'll know our secret thoughts.}
<A>__{there is scratching against the door. the doorknob turns. graham grabs it with both hands. the door begins to push open.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{merrill!}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{got it!}
<A>__{merrill reaches between two stacks of shelves and pulls out a pick for digging in the ground. he holds it up in the air. it has a three foot wooden handle. merrill turns and rushes in graham's direction. a single light bulb hangs from a wire in the ceiling. it is the only light in the room. merrill clips the light bulb with the end of the wooden handle as he crosses the room.}
<B>__{the bulb shatters. the basement is instantly black.}
<C>__{bo}
<D>__{dad!}
<A>__{we hear the sounds of sudden commotion, voices. struggling}
<B>__{at the door. steps on broken glass. click. a beam of a flashlight comes on. it illuminates morgan standing next to a rack of metal shelves. he turns the flashlight in his tiny hands. the narrow beam moves across the darkness. it finds merrill and graham leaning up against the basement door.}
<A>__{morgan moves the beam down to the pick, which is wedged}
<B>__{between the doorknob and the ground. the pick wavers a}
<A>__{little with each push from the other side, but holds.}
<B>__{the scratching and movement outside the door begins to lessen.}
<A>__{beat. morgan slowly moves the beam back up to his father's}
<B>__{face.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{where's bo?}
<A>__{the beam searches in the darkness. through the boxes,}
<B>__{between the shelves... it settles on a small foot hiding}
<A>__{behind a couple twenty five pound bags of dog food. bo's}
<B>__{head slowly appears. she squints as she looks in the light.}
<C>__{bo}
<D>__{i'm okay.}
<B>__{another beam comes on. it reveals merrill at the shelves with a second flashlight. he looks over the contents of the shelves near him. beat. his beam of light falls on a radio.}
<A>__{he turns the knob to "on." the radio lights up, but no sound emerges for it's speakers. merrill turns the channel knob and checks all the stations. no sound. no signal. he listens to the light hum from the speakers. beat.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{what's happening out there?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(in the dark)}
<D>__{i can't even imagine.}
<B>__{they all listen to the dead air hum from the radio speakers.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{i hope they're doing better than we are. we don't even have helmets.}
<B>__{there is a loud bang. both flashlight beams crisscross over the basement and come to a stop on the door. another bang. the door vibrates. the pick with the wooden handle holds in place. bang.}
<A>__{graham steps into the beam of lights. he looks at the door and then turns and faces the lights.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{they're just making noises. they're not trying to get in.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why are they doing that?}
<A>__{graham looks at merrill's corner of the darkness. morgan moves his beam onto merrill.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{they want our attention on the door?}
<A>__{bang. a beat of silence.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{they're distracting us?}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{from what?}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{the book says they're probably very good problem solvers.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{what book!}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{they'll find a way in.}
<B>__{bang.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{morgan, give me your flashlight.}
<A>__{morgan puts the flashlight on the ground and rolls it across}
<B>__{the floor. the beam spins in tiny circles showing the broken glass of the bulb in the middle of the floor.}
<A>__{the flashlight comes to a stop in graham's palm. he picks it up.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{is there an air vent in here?}
<A>__{merrill moves next to graham. another bang from the door. they aim their flashlights in one corner of the room. the brothers move in opposite directions.}
<B>__{graham moves his beam up and down checking the walls and the ceiling as he moves.}
<A>__{merrill moves between shelves, one at a time. his flashlight}
<B>__{peers behind the stacks of canned goods. a bang echoes through the basement door.}
<A>__{merrill and graham are at opposite ends of the room now.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i can feel air.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{me too.}
<B>__{the two beams of light start moving towards each other.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{it's getting stronger.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{i'm close.}
<B>__{bang. the beams move up and down over the final wall. graham and merrill move closer and closer... the two beams finally come to a stop in the same place... they shine down on morgan. he sits on the ground against the wall. he stares up at the two lights.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{what?}
<B>__{in the beam of lights you can see his hair moving gently from a breeze. graham and merrill turn their lights straight into the air}
<A>__{vent he's leaning against.}
<B>__{eyes are revealed in the darkness of the vent. a narrow set of metallic colored fingers shoot out between the holes in the vent grill and grab morgan.}
<A>__{morgan screams. the flashlights drop to the ground. there's}
<B>__{a desperate scramble. feet move through the beams of light.}
<A>__{we can't see what's happening.}
<C>__{merrill }
<D>__{hold the vent!}
<B>__{someone picks up a flashlight. we see glimpses of straining faces. morgan screaming.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{pull him!}
<B>__{the flashlight is dropped and picked up again. we see it is bo who is holding the light. bo turns the light at the vent. merrill is the only one}
<A>__{there. he presses one of the twenty five pound bags of dog}
<B>__{food against the metal grill. he drags the second bag over with his foot and slams it against the first bag. he quickly moves out of the light. bo follows him with the beam. she finds him dragging an enormous bag of flour over to the vent. he heaves it on top of the pile. he leaves the light again. returns with another giant bag of flour. grunts as he throws it on top of the rest. merrill falls to the ground exhausted. the pile of dog food and flour completely obscure the vent. a can of soup rolls on the ground near merrill. he slowly picks it up and puts an additional eight ounces on the pile.}
<A>__{merrill slowly catches his breath. he reaches over to his side and grabs the remaining flashlight. he trains the beam}
<B>__{around the room till he finds morgan.}
<A>__{he finds the boy in graham's lap. morgan is seated with his back against graham's chest. using him as a chair. morgan's}
<B>__{face is pale. he is taking very long slow heaves. it sounds}
<A>__{like the air is going through a straw. he's suffocating.}
<B>__{graham looks up into the light.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{we don't have his medicine.}
<A>__{merrill looks at his nephew turning gray. graham pulls morgan closer to his body and talks into the child's ear.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{don't be scared morgan. we'll slow it down together. feel my chest. feel it going in and out. breathe like me. breathe like me.}
<A>__{morgan's throat is closing his face is filled with strain and panic.}
<C>__{bo}
<D>__{he can't breathe.}
<A>__{bo moves to merrill and curls up with him as they watch. graham closes his eyes. beat. he opens his eyes and talks into morgan's ear.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{stay with me. stay with me. i know it hurts. be strong baby... it'll pass.}
<A>__{graham closes his eyes talks to the darkness.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{don't do this to me again. not again.}
<A>__{merrill stares at his brother's desperate face. graham's eyes open as morgan's tiny fingers press down on graham's hand. the fingers squeeze with all the strength they have. graham looks to merrill helplessly. merrill's eyes fill up with water. graham's eyes close.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i hate you. i hate you...}
<A>__{graham's eyes open as he leans in close to morgan's ear.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{the fear is feeding it... don't be afraid of what's happening... believe it's going to pass... believe it... just wait... don't be afraid... the air is coming... believe... we don't have to be afraid... it's about to pass... here it comes... don't be afraid... here comes the air...}
<A>__{a thin stream of sound emits from morgan's throat. like the}
<B>__{sound of air leaking from a balloon.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{there we go... we don't have to be scared at all... we know it'll pass. we believe it... don't be afraid morgan.}
<A>__{morgan's fingers relax a little on graham's hand.}
<B>__{the leaking balloon sound turns back into the sound of air through a straw.}
<A>__{merrill watches as graham's face stays pressed up against his son.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{feel my chest... breathe with me. together... the air is going in our lungs... together... we're the same. we're the same.}
<A>__{merrill watches as morgan's chest starts to move in sync with graham's. the sound of the straw fades as morgan's breathing turns into}
<B>__{labored breaths.}
<A>__{graham's eyes close. he starts crying. he speaks to no one.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{i hate you.}
<A>__{morgan's fingers relax on graham's hand. merrill watches as father and son breathe together. merrill and bo hold each other tight. the flashlight flickers on graham and morgan's exhausted}
<B>__{faces. they both stare out into the darkness of the}
<A>__{basement. tears drying on their cheeks. they're both lost}
<B>__{in their thoughts.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{i should save the flashlights.}
<A>__{beat. graham nods without looking over.}
<B>__{merrill presses the button on his flashlight. the beam of light illuminating graham and morgan goes out. they disappear into shadows.}
<A>__{merrill looks down to bo, who has the second flashlight in her hand. the beam points up at the basement ceiling above}
<B>__{her and merrill.}
<A>__{merrill nods to her. she reaches down and presses the button.}
<B>__{the basement is engulfed by black.}
