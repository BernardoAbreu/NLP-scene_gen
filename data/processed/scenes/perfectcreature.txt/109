<L>__{103 ext: jamestown slum building, roof night}
<A>__{jamestown, from above. we drift down so that we see the buildings, see fires breaking out, hear screams echoing through the night. we continue down towards the rooftop of one building in particular. we see one of the infected citizens of jamestown standing on the roof, screaming out into the night like some crazed animal. we continue past the creature, then travel through a ventilation shaft on the roof. we hurtle down this, down, down to the depths of the building and out the shaft into a subterranean basement. we drift through a doorway in the wet stone wall, down a tunnel, to finally enter a room. and we see lilly. she is covered in grime, her hands bound above her head with chains to an ancient, ornate pipes that twist through the place. she looks up at us. cut to}
