<A>__{now barely aloft, carl pulls the house across the rocky landscape. russell's harness drags along side, empty. russell walks behind.}
<L>__{exterior mountain hillside morning}
<A>__{with the last of his energy, carl drags the house into place. the house groans as it comes to rest. carl drops the hose harness and walks to the edge of a cliff.}
<L>__{exterior paradise falls morning}
<A>__{he looks over. he's finally made it: paradise falls. torrents of water careen over the massive cliff edge. carl takes out ellie's childhood drawing. next to him stands the real house, just like ellie wanted.}
<C>__{russell }
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{behind him, russell throws his sash on the ground.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{i don't want this anymore.}
<A>__{russell walks away. he sits on a rock, alone. carl picks up the sash. he walks up the steps of his house.}
