<D>__{grab a seat.}
<A>__{suttle sets himself in the passenger seat of the truck. sally emerges from the building, ticked off, carrying an armload of file boxes, and makes a beeline for red. saunders gently touches red's shoulders; a final plea.}
<C>__{saunders}
<D>__{please red, i'm beggin'. i mean, what am i suppose to tell the governor?}

<C>__{saunders}
<D>__{not a scratch, you hear me, suttle? not a scratch!}
<A>__{saunders stops, breathing hard, next to sally. she's pissed and overloaded with files.}
<B>__{airstream}
<A>__{about 20 yards down the way, comes to a stop. a second later the door opens and the steps pop out. sally walks toward the bus but when she arrives at the door... ... laughter filters out of the airstream. the airstream moves another 20 feet then stops. sally waits a full five seconds, then she blows the hair out of her eyes and, against her better judgment, moves cautiously forward, the file boxes getting heavier by the minute. again, when she gets close... ...the airstream moves. sally, boiling mad as her coiffure wilts in the texas sun, stops, and tosses down the file box in anger. the airstream stops. laughter from inside and a few ad libs, i.e. "okay, okay." more laughter. red steps out the door, turns his gaze back inside and the laughter and comments stop on a dime. smiling slightly he turns to sally, moves straight for the file box, picks it up and walks back to the airstream. when he arrives at the steps he turns, looks to sally, who stews and holds her ground.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{you comin' or not?}
<A>__{she hesitates only a moment before walking straight to red, grabbing back her file box and entering in front of him.}
