<L>__{exterior lookout, vietnam tom's squatting ground night}
<A>__{vietnam tom sits at his new squatting ground, looking out over all of el reno. he peers at the twinkling lights through his scrap metal bunny mask, and cradles his rifle in his arms like a soldier at rest. he slowly turns and sees that sam is sitting right next to him, facing the landscape. she wears her hooded sweatshirt, jeans and the bandage. the shard of metal is lodged in her forehead.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you wanna know what happens when you die?}
<A>__{tom shakes his head no.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{i wish it was me.}
<A>__{she looks at tom.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{i really want... to die.}
<A>__{tom aims his gun at her face... he realizes that a force field has formed in between them, because when the barrel of the gun touches it, the barrier bends and becomes slightly opaque. sam is expressionless. tom's finger trembles as he places it on the trigger. he aims down the gun's sights, directly at sam's right eye, and sees a phosphorescent grid take shape like a coordinate system on the force field. sam's eye is in the central}
<B>__{quadrant...}
<A>__{tom pulls the trigger. time slows down. a liquid vector spear shoots out of the gun barrel. immediately after, a bullet is discharged and follows it... the vector spear passes cleanly through the grid, but when the bullet reaches it, the entire force field curves to accommodate the penetrating force... the spear juts out until it nearly touches sam's eye... but then it stops. the bullet catches up and freezes at the same spot, centimeters from her face }
<C>__{sam }
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{not today.}
<A>__{i e. motel room 15 day a hand bangs on the door to room 15... after a beat, sam opens it. she's got some makeup on, and has spent more time on her hair than usual.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{chris lingers in front of the door, looking slightly uncomfortable.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i just stopped by to see how you were holdin' up.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm okay.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{sorry about the other night... i didn't }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i was just upset. i shouldn't have snapped at you like that.}
<A>__{chris nods, grateful for her forgiveness.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{so what are you still doin' here? i figured you woulda hopped on a bus by now.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm gonna be taking off soon, i think. i just gotta figure some stuff out. it's quiet here.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i don't know if you're doin' anything later on, but...}
<A>__{he trails off when he hears a car pull up and park by his truck. he turns and sees that it's jeremy in his bmw.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i was just on my way out. what were you gonna say?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{nothin'.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{okay, well... i will see you later?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{yeah, sure.}
<A>__{he steps out of the way so sam can shut and lock the door.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{bye.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{bye.}
<A>__{chris stares down jeremy as sam gets into his car and they drive off together.}
