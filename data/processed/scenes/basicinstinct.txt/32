<C>__{lt. walker}
<D>__{how you're saying she killed her parents? did she kill bobby vasquez, too?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.}
<C>__{lt. walker}
<D>__{maybe she did, gus. maybe she grew herself an afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face. let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{fuck you, phil.}
<C>__{lt. walker}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i'm off duty, nilsen. you hear me? i'm off duty discussing a case. internal affairs shouldn't have any trouble with that. maybe i should put in for overtime.}
<C>__{nilsen}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{you do that, shooter. why don't you send it to me? i will give it special attention.}
<A>__{a beat, and then nick gets up, faces him.}

<D>__{i'm gonna tell you once more, nilsen }
<A>__{lt. walker and gus get up and hold nick back. beth gardner, the police psychologist, is suddenly there.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{what's the problem?}
<C>__{nilsen}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{no problem, doctor. here comes the doctor just in time to save her patient. take care, shooter.}

<C>__{lt. walker}
<P>__{(watches them go out)}
<D>__{sometimes i think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with internal affairs.}
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(after a beat, smiles)}
