<A>__{olive lounges on her bed, flipping through a magazine and talking to rhiannon on the phone.}
<C>__{rhiannon }
<D>__{brandy carter was telling vanessa hodges that you lost your virginity to three guys in a jacuzzi.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{well, i guess that's better than me getting crabs from a guy twice my age.}
<C>__{rhiannon }
<D>__{ewww. who said that?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{you know that brandon kid?}
<C>__{rhiannon }
<D>__{from your seedy pre pubescent closet romp?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{the one and only. it's what somebody told him.}
<C>__{rhiannon }
<D>__{nobody talks to him.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{isn't that sad? he's actually quite the conversationalist.}
<C>__{rhiannon }
<D>__{he's gay.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{since when are straight guys under the age of eighteen able to converse?}
<A>__{a call beeps in on the other line.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{shit. hold on.}
<A>__{she clicks over.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{brandon }
<D>__{olive?}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(singsong)}

<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{it's brandon.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{speak of the devil...}
<C>__{brandon }

<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(intrigued)}
<D>__{okay. yeah. sure.}
<C>__{brandon }
<D>__{okay. see you soon.}
<A>__{olive clicks over to rhiannon.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{dude, that was brandon. he wants to talk to me about something.}
<C>__{rhiannon }
<D>__{probably wants to borrow an outfit.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{that's so mean.}
<C>__{rhiannon }
<D>__{any word from george?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{rhi, i told you. it was a one night stand. which is now a done night stand.}
<C>__{rhiannon }
<D>__{you're being awfully cavalier about this. i mean, he popped your cherry. aren't you supposed to be eternally in love with him and shit?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{if i was a character on a cw show, then, absolutely, i'd be blubbering all over my teen vogue. hey, we should start a rumor that i'm having a pregnancy scare!}
<A>__{olive is stoked by her idea.}
