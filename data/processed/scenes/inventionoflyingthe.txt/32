<L>__{interior mark's apartment building hallway afternoon}
<A>__{with all of his belongings piled up in the hallway, a tired and sweaty mark stares defeatedly at his landlord.}
<C>__{landlord}
<D>__{you have one day to get your things out of this hallway.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{how am i supposed to do that?}
<C>__{landlord}
<D>__{you've got three hundred dollars. rent a truck.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{oh, fuck me.}
<A>__{mark grits his teeth in rage.}
<L>__{interior bank day}
<A>__{mark steps up to the female teller at the bank. mark is at the lowest point in his entire life.}
<C>__{bank teller}
<D>__{how can i help you today?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'd like to make a withdrawal.}
<C>__{bank teller}
<D>__{okay, sir. i'm confident i can help you with that.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i've just been evicted from my apartment so i need to withdraw what i have left in my account so i can move my things out. i guess i need to close out my account to do that.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i think i'm about to be homeless.}
<A>__{close on mark: this sinks in.}
<C>__{bank teller}
<D>__{unfortunately sir the system is down right now so i'm not going to be able to perform an account closure until the system is back up. but i can assist you in a withdrawal. how much would you like to withdraw?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{well, i'd like to withdraw eight hundred dollars.}
<A>__{the bank teller smiles at mark.}
<C>__{bank teller}
<D>__{how much are you going to withdraw today, sir?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{all of it. just whatever is left.}
<C>__{bank teller}
<D>__{the system is down, sir. please tell me how much you have in your account?}
<A>__{at the peak of his despair something suddenly comes over mark. his face turns a light shade of red as the wheels begin to spin in his brain. he is fighting something within. we fly into mark's skull, traveling through his cerebral cortex and towards the frontal lobe of his brain. sparks are flying back and forth across his brain as his synapses fire in rapid succession. there is a small explosion. we fly back out of mark's skull his eyes are locked on the bank teller's like a deer in the headlights.}
<C>__{bank teller}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(awkwardly fast)}
<D>__{eight hundred dollars.}
<C>__{bank teller}
<D>__{pardon me?}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(more confident)}
<D>__{i have eight hundred dollars in my bank account.}
<A>__{the teller locks eyes with mark... then looks towards her computer.}
<C>__{bank teller}
<D>__{wait a second here. the system just came back up.}
<P>__{(to co worker)}
<D>__{system seems to be back up, guys.}
<P>__{(to mark)}
<D>__{just one second while i access your account. you said you're withdrawing eight hundred, correct?}
<A>__{mark breaks out in a cold sweat.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yup.}
<A>__{the bank teller types on her keyboard.}
<C>__{bank teller}
<D>__{well, look at this. it says here you've only got three hundred dollars in your account. but you said you wanted to withdraw eight hundred?}
<A>__{mark doesn't know what to say. he tries to speak but nothing comes out.}
<C>__{bank teller}
<D>__{i apologize for this sir, but it seems our system has made a mistake. hold on one second while i go and get your eight hundred dollars. did you want that in large or small bills?}
<A>__{mark gulps.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{large bills.}
<A>__{the teller walks away. mark looks around nervously, awkwardly smiling at the other tellers.}
<C>__{bank teller}
<P>__{(to co worker)}
<D>__{guys the computers seem to be a bit buggy. will someone call james to come in and look into it, please?}
<A>__{moments later the bank teller returns and begins counting out eight hundred dollars for mark. mark stares at the money with wide eyes.}
<C>__{bank teller}
<D>__{there you are. eight hundred dollars. anything else i can do for you today?}
<A>__{in shock, mark shakes his head. the bank teller smiles big at him.}
<C>__{bank teller}
<D>__{sometimes our computers can get a bit buggy, especially when the system goes down. sorry for any inconvenience.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it's no problem.}
<A>__{mark takes his money and hurriedly walks away.}
