<L>__{interior wayne manor guest bedroom day}
<A>__{tight on the face of dick. he lies unconscious in a big soft frilly bed a woman's hand wipes his feverish brow with a damp cloth; he moans slightly... his eyes snap open suddenly. he sits bolt upright with a yelp.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{no, no don't try to get up you're hurt.}
<A>__{he pushes her aside and climbs out of bed anyway. his shoulder is bandaged, his arm in a sling. the pajamas he's wearing are three sizes too large. he paces about, staring at his unfamiliar surroundings.}
<C>__{vicki }
<D>__{it's all right. you're safe. you can stay here as long as you need to.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{i don't belong here. you can't keep me here.}
<A>__{vaguely unnerved, he goes to a window, pulls back the shades, looks out at the grounds.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{it's "dick", isn't it? or do you prefer "richard"?}
<A>__{he stares at her as if she's nuts. vicki opens a closet door: all of his ratty belongings are hanging inside including the red and green gymnast's suit with the "r" insigne on the breast.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{"r" for richard, right? see, all your things are here...}
<P>__{(staring at the costume)}
<D>__{what is it, some kind of gymnast's outfit?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{it's none of your business. what is this, some kind of home?}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{no, not that kind. there's a swimming pool tennis court you can have anything you want.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{tennis court?! lady, you're rich. how the hell would you know what i want?}
<A>__{vicki tries to lay a soothing arm on his shoulder. he bats it away, pushes her aside and turns toward the door in agitation }
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{i'm not staying. you can't make me }
<A>__{ and sees bruce standing in the doorway looking at him.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i can make you.}
<A>__{dick freezes as if bruce's mere presence has mesmerized him. the hint of a smile plays across his face: ohhhhh. i'm in batman's house.}
<C>__{bruce }
<D>__{come on. wanna go at it?}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{look, kid like it or not, you're my guest and long as you're here you might as well enjoy it.}
<A>__{alfred appears with a tray of hot food and sets it down on a bedside table. dick edges toward it and sits down. he waits for alfred to leave and then tucks in hungrily eyeing bruce all the while.}
<C>__{bruce }
<D>__{will you two be okay in here?}
<A>__{vicki nods yes. bruce backs out of the room.}
