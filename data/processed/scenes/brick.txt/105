<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{this isn't good.}
<A>__{the brain looks hard at him. brendan stares off into space for a beat, then takes the brain's cell phone and dials.}

<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i've been cut loose. i'm not safe here. we shouldn't have met in the open. alright, lay low, but ask on the underneath for dode. that's all that matters now, find dode, but do it on the underneath, got it?}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{what are you going to do?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i'd like to have played it safe, but there's no time. the pin's not letting anything drop, so i gotta push things a bit.}
<C>__{the brain}

<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i don't know. just find dode.}
