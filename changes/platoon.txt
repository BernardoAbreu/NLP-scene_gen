We wait.  They are getting close. The CREDITS continue to run. SUBTITLE reads: December 1967 - Bravo Company, 25th Infantry Division - Somewhere near the Cambodian Border. A sweating white face comes into view. CHRIS - cutting point. Machete in one hand, whacking out a path for the platoon, M-16 in the other, he looks like he's on the verge of heat exhaustion. Breathing too hard, pacing himself all wrong, bumping into things, tripping, not quite falling, he looks pathetic here in the naturalness of the jungle.  An urban transplant, slightly neurotic and getting more so. His rucksack is coming apart as well, about 70 badly packed pounds banging noisily. Behind him BARNES now comes, the Platoon Sergeant.  Then the RTO, his radio man, humming lightly.  Others are behind, the column snaking back deep into the brush. We cut around some FACES of the Platoon - all to be seen later. Young faces, hard and dirty after weeks in the field, exhausted yet alert, fatigues filthy, slept-in, torn, personalized, hair way past regulation length, medals, bandanas.  A jungle army. Boys. Chris glancing down at his raw bleeding blisters. Transfers the machete to his other, slightly less blistered, hand.  The kid cuts on - struggling but trying, on his last reserves of strength, smashing almost straight forward through brush, not even bothering to look ahead.  He smells something, looks around, slows his pace, eyes working ... around to the base of a tree. He moves past it. And as he does so, the camera from his POV comes around on a dead decomposing 10-day-old GOOK - eyes starting from its sockets, worms and flies feasting. Chris draws his breath in, terrified.  Barnes suddenly appears alongside, his hard humourless eyes looking annoyed from the gook to Chris.}

And the whirr of a million mosquitoes out after the rains, chewing at Chris' face. He looks around, startled. Tex is asleep.  Junior is asleep.  What happened?  He looks at his watch.  The mosquitoes are eating him alive.  He buries his head in his green towel which he wears around his neck, but he can't see.  A beat.  He moves again, miserable from the bites. Another beat.  Then suddenly the sounds of the jungle shift - some of the animals dropping out.  A different tone.  A piece of wood is stepped on, a rustle of bush ... Chris sees something, lifts an edge of the towel to peek out. A shoadow of a figure is frozen there in front of him about 15 yards.  It looks like a man.  But it doesn't move.  At all.  It listens. Chris, his heart in his mouth, tries to peer through it.  It's a bush.  It has to be.  No human being could stand that still.  His heartbeats are up.  The moments take forever.  But deep down - somewhere in his psyche - he knows who it is. The figure now shifts, ever so slightly - and moves.  It IS a human being.  Oh my God! Chris looks around.  Tex seems like a mile away.  Why doesn't anyone fire!  He casts a desperate look at his rifle, at his grenades encrusted with mud, but in spite of all his training, he is frozen with indecision and fear at the sight of his enemy. The figure seems to whisper something back, then turns and comes down the trail.  Now a second and third figure appear behind him - all in helmets and packs.  All coming right past Chris' position.  Ten yards.  Nine. Chris is rigid with terror.  Stark eyes.  Pleading with Tex to wake up, but out of reach.  He is about to have an anxiety attack, his heartbeats so far up he is sure they will hear him. The first figure is now directly in front of Chris on the trail, looking left and right.  A rattle of his equipment, a creak of leather.  A smell.  The man's face now catches the moonlight and his eyes come around on Chris. Oriental eyes.  Looking right at him.  Startled.  Chris staring back, hypnotized.  It all happens very fast.  The figure murmurs something in Vietnamese.  A warning.  He swivels. A flash of muzzle fire.  A raking cough of automatic fire.  A grenade explosion. Chris is hurled to the ground, helmet bouncing off, scattered, confused, jarred.  All hell breaks loose around him with NOISE and SHOUTS. Tex, kissing the ground, is yelling at him.}

Twenty-five meters off.  Snapping the magazine out of his AK to reload.  A live gook. Chris tears off a volley at him but the gook disappears in the hole.  This is the moement, Chris realizes it, it's now or never if Chris intends to get the gook.  He's got to make a move before the man has reloaded his weapon. He pulls his grenade, pops the pin.  He lets the spoon fly off, activating the grenade-timer, as he humps to his feet and runs for the gook hole, concentrating, concentrating.  That head is going to pop up any second with a freshly-loaded weapon and tear his head off. Chris won't make it back to the hole.  The throw has to be perfect.  He won't get another chance.  He heaves the frag, drops and rolls away.  The throw is perfect, the golden arc of flight from the outfield nailing the baserunner.  It twists cleanly in the hole.  The explosion muffled but deadly. Chris scrambles to his feet, a look of almost total surprise on his face.  He can't seem to believe he did it.  Pointing his M-16 before him, he advances on the hole, looking over the muzzle to see the badly-mangled NVA man twisted at the bottom. Chris hurries over to Lerner.  He's in bad shape, hit in several places, vaguely conscious.}

These are his sons who are lost.  A good officer. Rodriguez, wounded, is lifted up in his litter and moved out to the waiting MEDIVAC CHOPPER, a huge red cross painted on a white square. Doc goes by on another litter, then Ace, Adams, Huffmeister, etc. Then Francis is littered by, bandages around his leg, a big smile on his face.}

<DIAL>__{Hey Taylor, you okay man?}
<CHAR>__{CHRIS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah.  How 'bout you?}
<CHAR>__{FRANCIS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Jes' fine man, jes fine!  Ain't never felt better! Both of us two timers man, we're out.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(gives him a slap as he goes by)}
<DIAL>__{See you at the hospital man, we gonna get high-high yessir ...}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(goes off)}
<ACTION>__{The Medic points to the chopper.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Chris)}
<DIAL>__{That's your ride man, you ready?}
<CHAR>__{CHRIS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(tries a smile)}
<DIAL>__{You bet.}
<ACTION>__{Chris starts towards it, the Medic assisting him.}
<LOC>__{EXT. PERIMETER #3 - LZ - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Sgt.O'Neill watches the loading process forlornly from the distance.  Captain Harris intersects him.}
<CHAR>__{HARRIS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You got Second Platoon Sergeant.}
<CHAR>__{O'NEILL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(reflexively)}
<DIAL>__{Yes sir -}
<ACTION>__{And as Harris moves away, O'Neill is left thinking.  Finally there is a certain frustration to his actions; he has taken such great pains to stay alive that the tuition he pays is precisely to stay in this Jungle.  Inevitably his time will come - one way or another. His eyes now follow the MEDIVAC CHOPPER upwards, whatever is left of his shrunken soul yearning to go with it.}
<LOC>__{EXT/INT: PERIMETER #3 LZ CHOPPER - DAY}
<ACTION>__{As the Chopper rises off the battlefield, Chris, who is sitting at the edge so that he has a full view out the open door, waves back at Rhah.}
<LOC>__{EXT. PERIMETER #3 - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Rhah, at the edge of the treeline, vigorously shakes his walking stick at him, his other hand a fist, waving them, emitting his cry.}
<CHAR>__{RHAH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Baaaaaaaaa!!!!!!}
<ACTION>__{Defiance.  Pride.  Dig me, I'm Rhah - and there isn't nobody like me in the world.}
<LOC>__{EXT/INT: PERIMETER #3 - LZ CHOPPER - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The chopper - with its huge red cross painted on - now rising to meet God.  Smashed on morphine, Chris looking out at the waving ants below. Now the trees, the skyline and the chopper is moving fast over the devestation.  The jungle forever locked in his memory, Chris looks back, copious, quiet tears flowing from his eyes.}
<CHAR>__{CHRIS } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{I think now, looking back, we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves - and the enemy was in us ... The war is over for me now, but it will always be there - the rest of my days.  As I am sure Elias will be - fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called possession of my soul ... There are times since I have felt like the child born of those two fathers ... but be that as it may, those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning to this life ...}
<ACTION>__{The music surges now to its full strength as we replay bits of film with each actor's name listed - some with silly, clowning looks, others sober, haunted.  Gardner, Tex, King, Rhah, Lerner, Sanderson, Manny, Big Harold - all the boys ... and then Barnes staring quietly into the camera, and lastly Elias - shirt off, bowl of grass in hand, his big, beautiful smile.}
