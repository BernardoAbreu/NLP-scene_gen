<L>__{exterior meadow day}
<A>__{perched on a heather carpeted rise above the village a young woman, mara, sits contemplating the intricaces of a daffodil. balancing on a shepard's staff, conor limps over and puts his lips to her ear.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{you're pretty today.}
<A>__{mara is silent. distant.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{i'm your future husband, remember?}
<C>__{mara}
<D>__{i have no future husband.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{i don't understand. not a week ago your father gave us his blessing.}
<A>__{this is difficult for her. tears well in her eyes.}
<C>__{mara}
<D>__{my future husband died in battle against the sutherlands.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{what are you saying? i'm standing here as real as you.}
<C>__{mara}
<D>__{you cannot be real, conor. you had the last rites. no man has been cut half as bad and lived.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{but i did live.}
<C>__{mara}
<D>__{live? in less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{so why the crazy talk? it's a miracle it is. saint andrew has smiled on me. on us.}
<C>__{mara}
<D>__{some think not.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{mara}
<D>__{there's rumor in the village. some call it magic.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{that's mad. surely you don't take their word?}
<C>__{mara}
<D>__{i don't know, conor. it's not natural. maybe something has touched you.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{you're sounding like that mad woman, widow baggins.}
<C>__{mara}
<D>__{me father has taken back my hand.}
<A>__{he puts a hand to her cheek.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{ah, lassie...}
<A>__{she steps back.}
<C>__{mara}
<D>__{please not be touching me, conor.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{i will not take that kind of talk from you. from those others below, maybe. but not from you.}
<C>__{mara}
<D>__{leave me alone, conor. please.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{you're not talking sense, mara!}
<A>__{anger tumbles into exasperation.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{he steps for her. she moves away. conor's face hardens with resentment.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{if you send me away now, mara, i will not come looking for you.}
<C>__{mara}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{do what you must.}
<A>__{resigned, conor turns and limps away.}
