<L>__{exterior pool patio, backyard night}
<A>__{in the dim spillover light from house, kramer crosses to the telephone box against the back of the house. it is open and several of the wires have been pulled. he looks around, spooked and puffs out a cloud of smoke from his pipe. for the briefest of instants, sebastian's face is visible in the smoke. kramer jumps back in surprise and the pipe drops from his mouth. he gives a small sharp cry, but deep indentations appear across his mouth and his cries are stifled. in the darkness, we can make out his form writhing as if possessed. the struggle continues a beat until kramer manages to break free.}

<A>__{as kramer runs, he looks behind him. but no one's there. wham! something slams into kramer and he tumbles, rolling into the pool. but as he hits water there's not just one splash, but two. in the water next to him is human shaped air pocket. it's sebastian displacing the water. and because of the water displacement, we can clearly see two arms pushing kramer beneath the water's surface. martha kramer opens the bedroom window and looks down at the pool. all she can see is her husband drowning... his flailing limbs kicking up a massive air bubble around him. she races from the window. kramer kicks and flails for a few moments and then his limbs stop moving. a moment later he floats to surface, face down. the air pocket bobs over to the pool ladder, and rising from the pool, we see sebastian's body outlined in sheets of water. the shape melts away in a cascading waterfall until all we can see of sebastian are the hundreds of tiny droplets still clinging to his body, caught in the light like twinkling bulbs on a christmas tree. the shape disappears into the darkness. a moment later martha emerges from the house and sees her husband floating face down in the pool. she screams.}
