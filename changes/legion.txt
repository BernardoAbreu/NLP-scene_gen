<ACTION>__{THE MOJAVE DESERT - DUSK Vast.    Barren.   No signs of life. A BLOOD RED SUN is sinking behind the distant mountains.    The unbearable heat will soon become an unbearable cold. A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE.    Solemn.   Weary.   Determined.}

<DIAL>__{When I was a little girl, my mother would remind me each night before bed to be sure to open my heart to God, for he was kind, merciful and just. Things changed after my father left a few years later, leaving her to raise me and my brothers alone in a little place out on the edge of the Mojave Desert. She never talked about a kind and merciful God again. Instead she spoke of a prophecy. Of a time when all the world would be covered in darkness and the fate of Mankind would be decided. One night I finally got up the courage to ask my mother why God had changed, why was he mad at his children. "I don't know," she said, tucking the covers around me, "I guess he just got tired of all the bullshit."}

<ACTION>__{reflected in a greasy puddle of water. Might just be the smog that's making it that ominous color. Then we notice something moving in the reflection. A dark shape, growing, coming down at us fast. Beat...then WHAM!}

<LOC>__{EXT. AN ALLEY WAY - LATE NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A DARK FIGURE in a tattered trench coat tumbles onto the pavement, hands out to slow the impact. A beat then slowly he climbs to his feet, recovering from what seems to have been quite a fall. He has chiseled features, shaved head, deep-set eyes. Looks like he's been through one hell of a fight. His name, we will come to know, is MICHAEL. He quickly checks out his surroundings, nothing but brick walls above him. Where'd this guy jump from? A RUMBLE of thunder...then RAIN starts to hammer down.   Seems to motivate him. Michael pulls his overcoat tight around his body and dashes toward the mouth of the alley. He reaches the STREET just in time to see a FLEET OF POLICE CARS tearing around the corner, SIRENS WAILING, heading this way. He reels back into the alley way, ducks down behind a trash dumpster, as the BLUE AND RED LIGHTS of the POLICE CARS whip past. Michael waits for the lights to disappear, then he pulls a MASSIVE ORNATE KNIFE from his jacket. Considers it grimly. Runs his finger along its edge. Blood beads up. Razor sharp. Michael begins to peel off his overcoat, revealing his bare chest underneath...and skin literally covered with DARK TATOOS. Hard to see what they are in this light. As his coat falls to the ground, we DRIFT over to the BRICK WALL behind him where we see MICHAEL'S SHADOW crouch over, and then... ...TWO LARGE SHAPES UNFOLD FROM HIS BACK, STRETCHING UP INTO}
<ACTION_ALT>__{WHAT ARE UNMISTAKABLY...THE SHADOW OF WINGS.}
<ACTION>__{The RAIN POUNDS harder, as if punishment from the heavens. The glint of the KNIFE coming down fast.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{A HORRENDOUS SOUND OF FLESH TEARING AWAY FROM BONE... ...THE BLOODY KNIFE CLATTERING TO THE PAVEMENT...}
<ACTION>__{...FOLLOWED BY MICHAEL'S UNGODLY SCREAM RISING UP FROM THE ALLEY WAY. And then SILENCE... CLOSE ON THE GUTTER, AS BLOOD BEGINS TO FLOW FREELY, MIXING,}

<ACTION>__{Michael, face tight with pain, trench coat back on, steps out of the alley, stares with determination at a dark storefront across the street. "GUN & SPORT WORLD"}

<ACTION>__{Cavernous. A Costco for survivalists.    Quiet except for the sound of RAIN, then... SMASH! Michael drops down through one of the skylights in a shower of glass.}
<LOC>__{INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER}
<ACTION>__{Michael bursts in. Tosses a first-aid kit into the sink. His trench coat falls to the floor and here in the fluorescent light, we get a better look at him. His thin but stunningly well muscled body is TATTOOED shoulder to ankle with INTRICATE WRITING. The man's flesh is a living book. But the writing is in no language we recognize. He turns his back to the mirror, revealing two HORRIFICALLY OPEN WOUNDS running down between both shoulder blades.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{FRESH. BLOODY.}
<ACTION>__{He threads a needle not with thread, but with FISHING WIRE, and begins to STITCH the wounds closed. BLOOD POOLS on the cement floor around his feet.}
<LOC>__{INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - MOMENTS LATER}
<ACTION>__{Trench coat and a shirt back on, Michael races along the ENDLESS RACKS OF GUNS, searching for just the right weapons, his every movement precise, as if he's trained his whole life for this. Weapon after ferocious weapon gets tossed into rifle bags. Whatever this guy's preparing for, it's big. Rifle bags filled, Michael heads for the exit.   Stops cold. The place is locked up tight.   Metal gate over the front doors, bars over the windows.   How the hell's he going to get out of here?}
<LOC>__{INT. LAPD SQUAD CAR - DRIVING - SAME}
<ACTION>__{Two COPS, world weary, cruise through downtown. That's BURTON behind the wheel, ESTEVEZ riding shotgun. The POLICE RADIO is ABUZZ WITH ACTIVITY.      Busy night. Burton stares out at the city's rain soaked denizens with a deep hatred, the shadows looming in doorways, the streetwalkers.}
<CHAR>__{BURTON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(sensing their unease:)}
<DIAL>__{It's starting. There isn't much time.}

<ACTION>__{Michael slowly turns around.    Calm. Estevez rushes in to restrain Michael, grabbing his wrist, FINGERS TIGHTENING. Michael closes his eyes, a terrible decision made. And that's when he moves, a fucking blur! In an instant Michael's broken the cop's arm, spinning him helplessly around, turning him into a human shield. Now it's Michael who's in charge, gun to Estevez's head, facing off with Burton. Burton struggles to find a shot, can't.}

<DIAL>__{Burton!?}
<ACTION>__{THE STREET LAMPS BEGIN TO FLICKER AND STROBE, adding to the confusion. Burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his WHOLE BODY QUAKING, heels CLICKING the pavement, as if some massive pressure were building inside him. And with the horrific sound of CRACKING BONES, BURTON'S MOUTH}
<ACTION_ALT>__{BEGINS TO TWIST INTO AN IMPOSSIBLY WIDE SMILE LIKE A BIZARRE}
<ACTION>__{CLOWN! His eyes SNAP OPEN, focused, the force inside him now fully in control. Burton looks at Michael with calm recognition, his voice GUTTURAL..INHUMAN. A man possessed.}

<ACTION>__{BLAM! Burton shoots his partner in the head. Estevez drops, leaving Michael without cover. Burton re-aims, but Michael's faster, already FIRING back. Bullets rip up the concrete. SMASH!   The squad car window SHATTERS, Burton's chest EXPLODING! And down he GOES, leaving Michael the only one left standing. Smoke rising from his gun. With soldier-like efficiency, Michael picks up the rifle bags and begins to load them into the trunk of the squad car. He gets in the car and FLOORS IT, ROARING AWAY, as the FLICKERING STREET LAMPS FINALLY GO OUT IN RAPID SUCCESSION, a wave chasing him, PLUNGING THE ENTIRE CITY INTO DARKNESS...}

<ACTION>__{A couple of ancient SILVERSTREAM TRAILERS are bathed in the eerie blue light of night's final moments. It looks like the trailers haven't moved from this patch of barren ground in decades. A single strand of colored Christmas lights dot the trailers roof lines, marking the season. One of the trailer doors CREAKS open and Jeep steps wearily out into the cool western morning. Home. Nothing but desert for miles in all directions, save for a two lane HIGHWAY and a weather beaten TRUCK STOP DINER that Jeep and his father will open for business in a few hours. Jeep gazes up to the diner's slanted roof where a large sign glows like a beacon in the darkness: "PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB" A beat as Jeep contemplates the sign.}

<ACTION>__{Charlie kisses him on the cheek and heads back to the trailer. He watches her, longing in his eyes. With the clank of the door, she's gone. And over Jeep's troubled look, the perennial holiday cheer of FRANK CAPRA'S "IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE" MIXES up.}

<ACTION>__{BOB HANSEN (late 40's), owner and proprietor of this fine roadside establishment, attempts to fix the old TV hanging in the corner above the counter by banging the shit out it. The restaurant itself has the kind of grungy diner charm you'd hope to find in a place last renovated in 1963. An old plastic Christmas tree strung with flickering lights and tinsel occupies a lonely corner. Next to that, a faded diorama of the NATIVITY SCENE. The kind you might order off the Shopping Network. Bob considers the TV with a frown. He deftly rolls an ENGRAVED SILVER ZIPPO back and forth over the nicotine stained fingers of his right hand. Must be a nervous habit. You can tell just by looking at the man that he's a beer drinker. Behind the counter, a black man named PERCY WALKER (60's) is cooking up a storm on the grill with spectacular one-handed dexterity. You do get pretty good at this sort of thing when your other hand has long been replaced by a METAL HOOK.   The dog tags around his neck tell the story. His white cook's hat has been temporarily replaced by a red Santa hat.}

<DIAL>__{Yeah, they got names for that kind a relationship.}
<ACTION>__{The JUKEBOX on the other side of the diner starts up with the MERLE HAGGARD tune "I'M A LONESOME FUGITIVE". A stunning looking sixteen-year-old GIRL with dyed-black hair and a piercing or three, is leaning seductively over the jukebox, swaying gently to the music. The headband doubling as her mini-skirt reveals her knock-out figure in a way that really doesn't leave much up to the imagination. She's a billboard of rebellion.}

Now in the daytime we see this is truly a place time forgot. Attached to the diner is a MECHANIC'S BAY. Grease stains and rusty car parts litter the ground. Behind the place is the SILVERSTREAM TRAILER we saw Jeep step out of earlier. The only thing here that looks fairly new is the UHAUL TRUCK parked in front of the garage with its hood up. Kyle grabs a crumpled hand drawn map from the front seat and flattens it out on the roof of the car. He spins it around. Which way is north?}

The bad news is that it's been broken for ten years. Leaning next to the broken phone, however, is Charlie wearing a shabby, faded WAITRESS uniform stretched tight around her very pregnant belly. Adding to her perfect mother-to-be look is that cigarette dangling from her lips. The plastic name tag pinned to her chest says "CHARLIE".}

His name is GABRIEL. Gabriel raises a massive, ferocious, strangely mechanical looking MACE in his powerful hands. And the world returns to NORMAL SPEED as Gabriel brings the mace arcing down at Jeep. Jeep rolls! CLANG!

Michael grabs a hold of Bob's ceiling mounted TV for support and lifts his body just above the deadly spike. Michael kicks Gabriel in the head, momentarily stunning him. Michael dives at Gabriel, landing an awesome flurry of punches. Gabriel is rattled back by the assault.   He clumsily lifts his mace and thrusts with it. Michael narrowly evades the razor point, which drives into a wall. Michael smashes down on Gabriel's wrist, CRACKING the bones.

The crash has done some serious damage. Much of his skin has burned away. Chunks of his armor and flesh are missing as well, including a large part of his head, revealing that under his human visage is a NIGHTMARISH CREATURE. Gabriel charges at Jeep fast. Jeep whips up his Glock, BLAM! Gabriel takes the bullet, then slaps the gun out of Jeep's hand. Jeep throws a wild punch, connects with Gabriel's chin, rocking him back. More annoyed than surprised, Gabriel knocks Jeep savagely to the ground. Jeep struggles quickly to his feet, comes right back at Gabriel swinging. But Gabriel simply knocks him to the dirt again. Jeep slowly gets up once more, bleeding, hurt.   Raises his fists. This kid will simply not give up.
