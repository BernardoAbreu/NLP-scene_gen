<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{hes just a regular guyt needs help, honey. look at him.}
<A>__{the hitchhiker is a man about thirty with a pack on his back, and he is carrying a large, covered cardboard box. he is filthy, with an uneven smile that exposes his jagged yellow teeth. lula opens the door for him, and after he loads his stuff, sailor takes off down the highway.}

<A>__{roach pulls a piece of raw cows liver out of one of his pockets of his field jacket and begins ripping little bits off it and feeding them to the dogs.}
<C>__{lula}

<C>__{lula}
<D>__{im sorry, but i cant take this. roach, or whatever your name is, you come out of there with them dogs this instant!}
<A>__{roach sticks the liver back in his pocket and pulls his pack and the box of tiny canines after him. once he and his belongings are deposited on the roadside, lula hops back in the car and slams the door.}
<C>__{lula}
<D>__{im truly sorry? im truly sorry, roach. but aint gonna make it to alaska? least not any part of the way with us. youd best find a party to take care of those dogs proper, before they all die? and, if you dont mind my sayin so? you could most certainly use some serious lookin after yourself, startin with a bath!}
