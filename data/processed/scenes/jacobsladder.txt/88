<L>__{exterior u.s. army recruiting headquarters night}
<T>__{cut to a sdiren blaring :}
<A>__{and a fire engine racing through the streets of lower manhattan. a crowd is forming. banks of lights and television cameras amass in the cold night air. police cars and mobile units rush to the scene.}
<T>__{cut to jacob:}
<A>__{. in one hand he is holding a brightly lit torch. in the other he is holding a container of gasoline and pouring it on the steps of the u.s. army recruiting headquarters. the volatile liquid splashes against his pants and shoes and runs down the pavement. a five gallon container lies emptying nearby. gasoline belches from it insistently and pours onto the street. bystanders back away as the gasoline snakes toward them. television cameras and microphones are pointing in jacob's direction, but at a safe distance. he is yelling at them, his teeth chattering from the cold.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{listen to me. there were four companies in our batallion. five hundred men. seven of us were left when it was over. seven! four companies engaged in an enemy offensive that not one of us who survived can remember fighting.}
<C>__{bystanders}
<D>__{use the torch!}
<C>__{onlooker}
<D>__{shut up! let him talk!}
<A>__{police ambulances are arriving at the scene. firemen ready hoses at nearby hydrants. t.v. cameras are rolling.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{you don't forget a battle where 500 men were killed. they did something to us. i want to know the truth, the goddamn truth. we have a right to know.}
<P>__{(he yells toward the cameras)}
<D>__{are you getting all this? i want this on national t.v. i want the whole country, the whole world to know.}
<A>__{he holds up the torch. a loudspeaker blares through the crowd.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{throw that torch away, young man. give yourself up. you're under arrest.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{for what? for seeking the truth?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{please come quietly.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you come near me and i will blow us all up.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{we're not going to hurt you.}
<C>__{onlooker}
<D>__{give him a chance to talk!}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{the army will deny it. they've falsified my records. they've lied to my lawyer, threatened my buddies. but they can't threaten me.}
<C>__{bystander}
<D>__{you tell 'em!}
<C>__{bystander}
<D>__{use the torch!}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{okay, let's clear the area. everyone out.}
<A>__{suddenly a lighted match flies in jacob's direction. jacob is enraged. he brandishes the torch at the crowd.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what the fuck do you think you're doing?}
<A>__{another match hurls toward him and dies in mid air. people on the fringe of the crowd begin to run. jacob does not move.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{clear the area. this is an order!}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what is wrong with you?}
<A>__{we hear laughter from people in the crowd. as jacob looks out into some of their eyes he sees demons looking back. one of them throws another match. crazed, jacob runs toward them. people jump back. suddenly jacob freezes. standing on the sidelines, he sees one of the army officials who trapped him in the car. he is reaching for a gun. jacob, stunned, yells at the top of hhis lungs.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{with a defiant roar, he hurls the torch straight up into the air. we see it from high above the crowd spinning higher and higher. all eyes stare upward watching it in a kind of wonder. then, reaching its apex, just below the camera, it begins its descent. the eyes of the crowd turn to fear. someone yells.}
<C>__{onlooker}
<D>__{he'll burn us all!}
<A>__{screams fill the air as people scramble to escape the potential conflagration. only jacob remains motionless, standing silently, almost heroically, in the middle of it all. suddenly the torch hits the ground and a pool of gasoline ignites with a blinding flare that sends flames shooting in all directions. people panic. t.v. reporters and cameramen run for their lives. the army officials run, too. the flames travel toward the army headquarters and rush along the curb. water hoses are trying to douse them as they spread. jacob, surprisingly untouched by the fire, walks slowly through the frightened crowds, as if in a daze. viewed through the flames the scene momentarily resembles a vision of hell.}
