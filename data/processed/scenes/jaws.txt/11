<A>__{martin brody's country squire police wagon rushes past, taking the view to an enormous billboard depicting a typical summer day in amity. a beautiful model splashes in the gold surf, languishing in a solarcaine sun. amity welcomes you is written above her flailing arms.}
<L>__{exterior amity beach day}
<A>__{three small figures in the landscape, walking the beach. the surf is rough and there is sea floor debris strewn about from the receding tide.}
<B>__{closer angle}
<A>__{deputy hendricks is searching the shore about one hundred yards down wind. meanwhile, brody, in his casual police attire, and tom cassidy, still in the clothing we saw him in last night, walk down the beach. brody fingers the missing girl's shoes, purse and clothes. in the daylight, cassidy misconducts himself, wavering between inflated maturity and tear blown adolescence.}

<D>__{christine what?}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{worthingsly... worthington no one ever died on me before.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{you picked her up on the ferry.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{i didn't know her.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{and nobody else saw her in the water?}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{somebody could've i was sort of passed out.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{think she might've run out on you?}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{oh, no, sir. i've never had a woman do that. i'm sure she drowned.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{you from around here?}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{no. cambridge. harvard. my family's in tuxedo, new york, though.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{you here for the summer?}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{some friends and me took a house.}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(genuinely curious)}
<D>__{what d'you pay for a place just for the summer?}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{a thousand apiece, something like that. there's five of us. and we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{pretty stiff.}
<A>__{a shrill whistle makes them turn. hendricks is fifty yards away, on his knees. he blows again, a feeble report this time.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{maybe that's your girl.}

<D>__{you can't make me look !}
<A>__{master angle the sand dune a skein of seaweed garnishes the base of this isolated dune. the booming waves and fizzing surf make dialogue inaudible. deputy hendricks on hands and knees, looking white as a sheet. brody tells cassidy to wait at the foot of the dune, and ventures up. hendricks stops him with a wave off, saying something at the same time. brody nods understanding and steps up cautiously and looks down. he adjusts his glasses, trying to make sense of what he is looking at. whatever he sees has a marked effect on his entire physique. kicking out with his foot, brody sends dozens of angry horseshoe crabs into an escape frenzy and they boil over the top of the dune and down its slopes. cassidy takes a few uneasy steps backwards when brody waves him over. he shakes his head. an awkward moment. then cassidy shuffles forward and up the few remaining feet, his eyes looking everywhere but down. brody says something else and cassidy shakes his head again, eyes out at sea. brody puts his hand gently around the quaking man's shoulder. nodding, he starts to look down, an inch at a time. he looks. he, too, can't make out what it is at first. then he understands. the jolt that assaults cassidy is not unexpected. he falls backward in a sitting position as though shot. nods yes it's her. brody turns and slides off the dune, stumbling close. hear his breathing. he looks around, envisioning the week ahead of him....}
