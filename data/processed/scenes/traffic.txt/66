<A>__{helena exits. her expression is set as she drives. she turns a corner in the shopping district, passing javier and manolo who are walking down the street. tourists, drunk marines and the homeless piss away another day. we follow them into a bar with blackened windows and a discrete sign.}
<L>__{interior bar day}
<A>__{this is a place where men come to meet men. and it's already lively even at this early hour. javier and manolo find a seat and wait.}
<C>__{later}
<D>__{javi is working on his second beer when he seems to recognize somebody.}
<B>__{across the room}
<A>__{francisco "frankie" flowers has entered the bar. javi watches him circulate through the room then settle at the bar. javier finishes his beer, rises, and takes the empty seat next to francisco. manolo watches. very quickly javi strikes up a conversation. we don't hear what they're saying but it doesn't matter because francisco clearly likes javi. off francisco's anticipatory smile }
