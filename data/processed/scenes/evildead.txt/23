<L>__{23 interior day m.r.}
<A>__{the interior of the cabin is completely dark. scott opens the door and stands silhouetted in the doorway for a moment, then enters to find the light switch. the illumination reveals floors, walls, and ceilings made of cedar. there are two small bedrooms, a kitchen, and the main room which contains a stone fireplace set into the wall. an old grandfather clock stands silently in one corner, partially hidden in the shadows. a door in the rear of the cabin leads to a small work shed containing a work bench and an assortment of tools upon the wall. located centrally in the main room is a trap door leading to the cellar. this catches scott's eye.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{hey, this place has a dungeon.}
