<L>__{interior general population day}
<A>__{the inmates eat. silence descends as archer enters intensifying the constant humming of the magnetic field. huge dubov does a slow burn on seeing "castor." scanning the room for pollux archer takes a seat next to a little, goateed man with a french accent.}
<C>__{little man}
<D>__{hey, castor remember me?}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{fabrice voisine... sure, i }
<P>__{(catches himself)}
<D>__{ i believe jon archer busted you for poisoning five members of the the canadian parliament?}

<D>__{those scumbags should never have voted against the quebecois.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{we heard you got wasted.}
<A>__{archer sees the other inmates sizing him up.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{do i look wasted asshole?}
<A>__{voisine shakes his head "no" then his eyes widen as... wham. dubov leaps onto archer and starts pummeling him. they slide across the table spilling everyone's lunch.}
<C>__{guard}
<P>__{(into comm unit)}
<D>__{central. i have a disturbance in population. go to lock down }
<C>__{walton}
<P>__{(into comm unit)}
<D>__{hold that lock down.}
<A>__{walton watches as dubov throws archer across the room. archer staggers to his feet and sees the encircling inmates and guards looking at him unimpressed. especially his "brother" pollux who watches uncertainly. dubov attacks again but archer is ready. he grabs dubov's fist just before it hits his face.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{never in the face.}
<A>__{holding dubov's fist firmly, archer kicks dubov repeatedly in the groin. metal boot meeting soft flesh. dubov staggers back hurt. archer moves in for the kill, savoring it. walton looks skyward.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{lock 'em down.}
