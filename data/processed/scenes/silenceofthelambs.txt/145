<A>__{high angle on sgt. tate as he leads a five man squad, all in bulletproof vests, up the stone stairs. they move fast but carefully, covering each other from landing to landing with drawn revolvers, shotguns. the distant back music makes a ghostly echo in here...}

<A>__{approaches very cautiously, gun aimed. the other cops, behind him, fan out silently to set up angles of fire, checking the various office doors all locked as they creep up. moving angle over tate's shoulder as he reaches the side of the elevator, hesitates, then spins to point his gun inside. it's empty. he backs away.}
