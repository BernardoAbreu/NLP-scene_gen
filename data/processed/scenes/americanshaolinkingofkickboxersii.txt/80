<L>__{exterior shaolin temple evening}
<A>__{establishing shot of temple courtyard, empty except for drew and li}
<B>__{playing catch with a frisbee.}
<A>__{drew is flipping it in a bunch of different ways, and li is enjoying watching him. to the side of the courtyard are two brooms leaning against the wall.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{this sure beats sweeping...}
<B>__{angle on frisbee}
<A>__{floating past temple statues and ancient chinese decorations, barely missing them. drew makes an acrobatic catch and then flicks it back to li, harder than he should have. it heads for an ancient statue and smacks it dead center, right in the face. the statue starts to tip! drew and li rush for the statue and catch it, just before it tips over and smashes on the ground. they look at each other, thanking their lucky stars the statue didn't fall. they start to throw the frisbee again, when drew spots the d.s. coming towards them. drew stashes the frisbee in his shirt and grabs the brooms. he tosses one to li and they just begin sweeping again when the d.s. rounds the corner. the d.s. knows something is going on, but they look so innocent.}
<C>__{d.s.}
<D>__{sweep the main chamber, drew.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{yes, master.}
<A>__{he bows and smiles goodbye to li. he walks into the main training chamber.}
