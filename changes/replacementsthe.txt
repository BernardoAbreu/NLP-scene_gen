<LOC>__{EXT. MARINA DEL REY - DAY}
<ACTION>__{It's raining lightly in the harbor and the water around the moored boats looks dirty and cold. We PICK UP a sad excuse for a boat sitting in an end slip. It's a sea-gull-shitcovered, thirtyfoot cabin cruiser that hasn't cruised in a long, long time. A ratty looking unpainted plywood addition has been nailed to the top of the cabin. It's partially covered with a blue plastic tarp. SUPERIMPOSE:   MARINA DEL REY, CALIFORNIA -}
<ACTION_ALT>__{FALL}
<ACTION>__{The tarp moves and SHANE FALCO's half-naked torso emerges from under it. Shane is late twenties, golden boy handsome, but quickly going to seed. He looks hung over. Shane glances up at the sky and rain. He pulls on the top part of an old patched wet suit and zips it up. He shivers.}
<LOC>__{EXT. MARINA DEL REY HARBOR - DAY}
<ACTION>__{We're BUZZING around the harbor with Shane in an old Zodiac inflatable DINGHY. Shane has pulled up the attached rubber hood to his wet suit so that only the white, pasty oblong of his face is visible. It's still raining as he steers the little boat around the sailboats and yachts. He pulls up to a fiftyfoot sailboat and CUTS the ENGINE. With practiced moves, he ties the dinghy to the rear rail of the sailboat and clips a bill for services rendered on the sailboat's stern line. He slips on a weight belt,    puts on a pair of old gaffer taped goggles,    jams the end of a air-hose in his mouth, and    falls backward out of the dinghy and into the    water.}
<LOC>__{EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY}
<ACTION>__{It's dark, dirty and murky. Suddenly, Shane floats INTO FRAME and comes AT us with a long spatula.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ANOTHER ANGLE}
<ACTION>__{He attacks the underside of the sailboat which is covered with green algae muck that hangs a foot off the bottom of the boat. The spatula scrapes away the green mess revealing the pure white underside of the boat.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{CLOSE ON SHANE}
<ACTION>__{As he scrapes. Muck from the boat floats past him. This doesn't look like fun. As he works, he happens to look down and notices something on the bottom. SHANE'S POV Amidst the beer cans and other trash, something golden is sitting on the bottom.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{BACK TO SCENE}
<ACTION>__{Shane takes a deep pull on his hose, lets it go and drifts down. A shaft of sunlight penetrates the murky water and reveals a broken trophy half-buried in the mud. Shane kneels over it and picks it up. The trophy is almost a full-size football rendered in bronze attached to a broken base. Shane turns "the ball" over in his hands. He grips the seams like he's done this before. Then he holds the football out in front of him. Suddenly, he starts barking garbled signals to an imaginary offense. He turns to his running back as he yells something like "Blue}
<LOC>__{31!" It comes out in bubbles}
<ACTION>__{He cocks his left leg and his wide receiver goes in motion. Then on the "snap" he turns and starts a five step drop. He moves in slow motion because hey... he's underwater! He executes a perfect play action fake on the third step of his drop, and looks "down field" for his receivers. But there's a blitz! He steps up in the pocket but a linebacker's arm almost takes his head off. He dodges, he bobs, he weaves in a kind of delicate ballet. He rolls left and keeps looking for the open man. Suddenly he points down field, pulls up and cocks his arm. The "ball" comes behind his ear and snaps forward in a perfect release. The trophy spins OUT OF FRAME but we HOLD ON Shane as he watches his pass. Suddenly, he throws both arms up in a touchdown signal. We STAY ON him as he freezes in this pose of victory, fifteen feet underwater, on the trash-covered, muddy bottom of Marina Del Rey.}

<ACTION>__{Martel is a pretty good broken field runner for a big guy. Plus with the defense covering every possible receiver, he's got a lot of daylight. Nobody has touched him as he crosses the fifteen. Suddenly, a safety, smaller than Martel, looms in front of him at the ten. Martel goes down in one of those wimpy quarterback slides before the safety can even hit him. BANG!   The GUN sounds and the game is over.}
