<L>__{interior sam's office evening}
<A>__{sam recovers consciousness to find himself sitting at his desk in his office. he is bruised and battered and has a black eye. his suit is torn and bloody. mr warren is gripping him by the throat and giving him a lecture. behind warren, crowding the doorway, are the people who circulate around him and are the cast of the warren high energy circus. lime is with them.}
<C>__{warren}
<D>__{this is a black eye for the department, lowry! ... and i don't care how you behaved when you were at records! information retrieval is an executive branch! we're proud of our reputation and we protect it!}
<A>__{one of his accolytes thrusts a paper into his hand he glances at it.}
<D>__{damn it, lowry, that convoy of troop carriers is still not accounted for ... i thought i told you to deal with it.}
<A>__{he slams the form down onto the desk which is covered with other forms.}
<D>__{and what the hell is this mess? an empty desk is an efficient desk.}
<A>__{he has picked up some of the forms.}
<D>__{good god! ... queries from security, searches from central banking about a cheque, clarification notices from accounting concerning unreturned receipts, another demand from the motor pool.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{mr warren ... i have to find out about ...}
<C>__{warren}
<D>__{shut up! i don't know what's going on here, lowry, but don't think you can intimidate us with your friends and relatives in high places! now shape up!}
<A>__{he dumps the papers and folders onto sam's desk and storms off with his entourage, leaving a gleeful lime in the doorway.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(grabbing lime as he starts to slip away)}
<D>__{lime, i need to use your computer}
<C>__{lime}
<D>__{sorry, a bit busy at the moment.}
<P>__{(he indicates sam's smothered desk)}
<D>__{you seem to have quite a lot to do yourself.}
<P>__{(he disappears into his office)}
