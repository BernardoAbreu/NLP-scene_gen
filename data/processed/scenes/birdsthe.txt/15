<D>__{oh, no you don't!}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{it's still bleeding a little. here, let me put this on.}
<A>__{he takes up a tiny band aid and, tearing the gauze off, says:}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{bend your head down. this little band aid won't show.}
<A>__{he presses the tiny band aid over the cut. melanie takes a mirror from her handbag and, bending her head down, looks at it. she covers her hair over it as mitch says:}

<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{none of your business.}
<P>__{(pause)}

<A>__{they turn toward the door. med. shot lydia brenner closing the door behind her, coming toward the bar. she is a woman in her late forties, attractive, wearing shirt, blouse, cardigan sweater, low heels. there is nothing agrarian looking about her. she speaks with the quick tempo of the city dweller, and there is lively inquiry in her eyes.}
<C>__{lydia}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{i thought i saw your car. what are you doing in town?}
<C>__{mitch}
<P>__{(rising to greet her)}

<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{after all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.}
<C>__{melanie }
<D>__{i'm sorry. i couldn't possibly...}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{you did say birds?}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{yes, lovebirds. we couldn't let you...}

<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{...get away without thanking you in some small way. after all, you haven't even met cathy and you are staying for the weekend...}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{yes, but...}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{you are, aren't you?}

<D>__{of course, how stupid of me. a quarter to seven, will that be all right?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{annie... annie may have made other plans. i will have to see. besides, i can find my own way.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{you're sure now? you won't hire a boat or anything?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i'm sure.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{seven o'clock then.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{maybe.}
