<A>__{evan, sitting on the couch next to miroki (evan's partner from cooking class), drinking a bottle of tequila. he's absolutely smashed.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{life's bullshit, huh, miroki?}
<A>__{suddenly, seth bursts into the room and grabs evan's shirt.}
<C>__{evan }
<D>__{fuckin' wax off, asshole!}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{no...i'm helping you, man! just listen...}
<A>__{seth grabs evan's wrists and tries to pull him to his feet.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{fuck off, jerk! you're hurting my shoulders!}
<A>__{just then, terry (the guy who spat on seth in the beginning) walks by.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{hey! look, it's christina and britney. have fun boning each other on grad night!}
<A>__{terry and his buddies laugh their asses off when, suddenly knock! knock! knock! the loud authoritative knocking echoes through the party and everyone looks to the door, knowing it can only mean one thing. someone opens the door, revealing officer slater and officer michaels! they talk to whoever answered the door, oblivious of evan and seth.}
<C>__{officer slater}
<D>__{we had a complaint about the noise. it looks like you're having a nice little party here.}
<C>__{officer michaels}

<C>__{seth}
<D>__{that's what i've been...! here...}
<A>__{seth pulls evan up and the two drunkenly make their way out of the living room just as the cops step into it.}
<C>__{officer slater}
<D>__{okay, everyone out. party's over. get out of here.}
<A>__{michaels turns to slater.}
<C>__{officer slater}
<D>__{i will go upstairs. i told you this would release some anger.}
<C>__{officer michaels}
<D>__{i will tell you what would release some anger, if one of these little fuckers touched me and i got to club his face in.}
