<L>__{interior fluegelheim back room day}
<A>__{a huge open room cluttered with all kinds of junk: archaeologist's tools, restoration equipment, etc., plus a healthy assortment of curios and oddities from all over. this is selina's private domain. camera tracks past a glass case full of ugly, withered, turdlike specimens...}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{what have we got here?}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{mummified cats. bastet's sacred animal. they were buried by the thousands at bubastis. oh, careful!}
<A>__{bruce freezes with his hand poised over a set of four earthen jars. each has a lid carved in the shape of a head: ape, jackal, man, falcon.}
<C>__{selina }
<D>__{canopic jars. in the process of mummification, the internal organs were buried separately.}
<P>__{(pointing to each jar in turn)}
<D>__{lungs stomach liver intestine }
<A>__{bruce withdraws his hand with a bemused shudder.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{you're in a gruesome line of work.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{keeps me interested. and that's not easy to do...}
<A>__{bruce's attention turns to a crumbling statuette of an odd beast: a winged lion with the head of a falcon.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{this one i know. it's a gryphon, right?}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{very good. a mythical demon, half bird, half lion...sweeping down from the sky to deliver retribution and justice.}
<A>__{bruce nods. he can dig it. he regards the gryphon for a long moment and chuckles.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{poor guy. birds and cats you wouldn't think the two halves would cooperate.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{only under certain circumstances.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm really glad you came, bruce. i was afraid i'd given you the wrong impression. or maybe it was the right impression.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{what was it you wanted to talk to me about?}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{your collection. i'd love to see it. i mean, everyone says you've got a fabulous }
<A>__{she breaks off in midstream and chuckles to herself. she toys demurely with her equipment. she looks up at bruce and switches tactics going for the direct approach. bruce braces himself...}
<C>__{selina }
<D>__{mainly i just wanted an excuse to see you again. does she know you're here vicki?}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{it must be strange. having all that power, and money never really knowing if that's what people are attracted to.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{what are you attracted to?}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{i think you're a little bit nuts.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i think you're a little bored with your life. having everything you want. no variety, no...danger. and every once in a while you need to take a risk. shake it all up.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{maybe by...coming here today.}
<A>__{she leans back against a crate, moistens her lips. she's letting him have it with both barrels.}
<C>__{selina }
<D>__{that's one thing i can give you, bruce danger a little something you can't get at home.}
<A>__{bruce hesitates but the lure is irresistible. he moves forward slowly; selina's eyes close; their lips draw slowly closer... ...and he sneezes in her face. she backs off in shock as he covers his face. his eyes are watering and he's wheezing. she rushes over }
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{is there a cat in here?}
<A>__{right on cue, selina's black cat hecate lets out a loud meow and stretches against bruce's pants leg. he brushes the animal aside and it leaps into selina's arms. bruce sniffles uncontrollably.}
<C>__{bruce }
<D>__{get it away!}
<A>__{she drops the cat, which scampers off. bruce rubs his eyes.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{poor thing. you're allergic!}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{yeah, cats...ever since i was a kid...}
<P>__{(snorting and weeping)}
<D>__{look, i'd better get some fresh air. maybe another time, okay...}
<A>__{he heads for the door before selina can stop him. he's gone, but she knows she's left a dent in his armor. she smiles in bemusement as hecate jumps into her arms and purrs.}
