<D>__{yo, this here pinetop. i think he got what you lookin' for.}

<L>__{exterior pool hall back door morning}
<A>__{tehronne leads laz down the back steps. they both round the corner, revealing an old chevy caprice. it is light brown except for one door that is gray, however the chrome rims on the car are impressive worth more that the entire car by a long shot.}
