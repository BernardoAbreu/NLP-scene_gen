<L>__{exterior ten bears' lodge day}
<A>__{an old indian man sits in the shade outside his lodge. his skin is leathery, his hair grey and wispy but his eyes are bright as diamonds. he is ten bears, well past sixty, but still strong enough to be the head man. he is, for the most part, oblivious to the grandchild squirming in his lap. he's smoking a long stemmed pipe, but the main object of his interest is an old woman squatting next to him... pretty shield. she's pounding away at something in a bowl. ten bears looks up to notice kicking bird. the medicine man is passing not far away and ten bears' eyes follow him carefully, not glancing away until kicking bird has ducked into his lodge.}
<C>__{ten bears}
<D>__{kicking bird has been keeping to himself these last few days. i do not like to see our medicine man walking so alone.}
<A>__{the old woman looks up from her pounding but does not respond.}
<C>__{ten bears}
<D>__{what does his wife say?}
<C>__{pretty shield}
<D>__{he is keeping to himself.}
<A>__{ten bears gives his wife a challenging look and she bristles.}
<C>__{pretty shield}
<D>__{that's what she says.}
<A>__{ten bears accepts this. then he looks down at the bowl.}
<C>__{ten bears}
<D>__{make sure that meat is soft... my teeth hurt.}
<A>__{ten bears looks once more at the entrance of kicking bird's lodge.}
