<L>__{interior u.n. assembly day}
<A>__{drew peeks in through the door, reading the country identifications on the desks... bangkok, borneo, bulgaria... canada. the representatives are in the middle of a heated debate that we hear being translated (and we see in subtitles).}
<C>__{chinese rep}
<P>__{(chinese; subtitles)}
<D>__{impossible! this would be globally destabilizing!}
<C>__{bulgarian rep}
<P>__{(pointing angry finger)}
<D>__{hah! posturing and rhetoric!}
<A>__{the canadian representative is sitting gingerly in his chair, shifting uncomfortably. he looks pale, shaky. drew commits herself and rushes down the stairs to his desk with the file.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{sir?}
<A>__{he puts a hand to his stomach he's struggling.}
<D>__{canadian representative #2}
<P>__{(ugh; groan)}
<D>__{yes...}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{oh, no. you didn't have the mussels at lunch, too, did you?}
<A>__{even as she holds out the file, he races past her, puckering his bum. she watches him waddle up the stairs but as he exits, he}

<B>__{angle on the detective}
<A>__{williamson's gaze comes to rest on... ... the back of drew's head. hm. that looks familiar. this is when the chinese rep stands, furious, and points an accusatory finger at drew!}
<C>__{chinese rep}
<D>__{this crisis falls at the feet of one nation and one nation only! canada!}
<B>__{all eyes turn to drew.}
<C>__{chinese rep}
<D>__{how do you defend such a position! the world is waiting to hear!}
<A>__{these are fighting words. the assembly grows silent. drew wishes she could beam herself somewhere off planet. she gulps air. glances left, right. but she knows the detective's eyes are on the back of her}
