<L>__{exterior parade ground day}

<C>__{dupont}
<P>__{(to soldier)}
<D>__{stand straight, you are a soldier of the king. soldier #1 yes sir.}
<A>__{dupont continues down the line. another soldier's infantry jacket is almost hilariously mis buttoned, one collar sticking up four inches higher than the other. dupont with both hands rips open the soldier's coat, spraying brass buttons onto the ground. he moves on.}
<C>__{dupont}
<P>__{(to soldier)}
<D>__{where is your bayonet? solider #3 lost it sir.}

<D>__{your rifle. hand it to me.}
<A>__{the soldier obeys. dupont inspects the firing mechanism.}
<C>__{dupont}
<D>__{the flint is cracked. no spark will reach your powder. you will die tomorrow.}
<A>__{he throws the rifle roughly back into the soldier's hands.}
<C>__{dupont}
<D>__{tomorrow you go to _battle_! and you look like children!}

<C>__{dupont}
<D>__{see to it.}
<C>__{sargeant}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<A>__{dupont turns briskly, then stops abruptly as if alerted by some thing. he whirls around and faces the young infantrymen. his expression is quizzical as he walks the line, checking each face carefully. one private seizes his attention. the private is cautious.}
<C>__{dupont}
<D>__{your name?}
<C>__{mulet}
<D>__{mulet.}
<A>__{it is as if dupont knows him. the two stare at each other. dupont turns and leaves.}
