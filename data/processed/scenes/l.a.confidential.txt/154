<L>__{interior records room lapd day}
<A>__{drawers are open. files are everywhere. exley's reached the end of the line. as he looks through one last file, he finds a stack of official photos. then he stops short. there's a photo of four cadets and an academy instructor. two of the cadets are ided as turner meeks and dick stensland. the instructor is dudley smith! exley looks up at the sound of footsteps and bud is there. fury. he slams exley, knocks him flat. bud's here to kill him. he hauls exley up, pummels him, then throws him over the table. then up into a wall. plaster cracks. bud's on some gonzo animal plane. bud strangles him. exley gags. it'll be over in moments. until exley's flailing hands finds bud's .38. yanking it from his waistband, exley smashes bud in the forehead. bud reels. but, blind with rage, he moves back in only to have the barrel of the .38 placed right between his eyes.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{lynn.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{she told you?}
<A>__{bud shakes his head. he's coiled, ready to make a move.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{who told you? did dudley have anything to do with you finding out?}
<A>__{bud hesitates, the answer obvious.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{listen to me. dudley killed jack. it has something to do with buzz meeks.}
<A>__{exley points out the academy photo on the floor.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{look. dudley and meeks go way back. stensland, too.}
<A>__{bud sees, but does he really? as bud reaches for the photo, exley relaxes slightly. bud slaps the gun away, drops exley to the ground. he grabs, begins slamming his head into the floor.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{think, goddamn you. think...}
<A>__{exley's almost out. but maybe bud heard him. the attack slows, stops as bud does think. exley stays conscious.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i knew stensland and meeks knew each other. meeks was with sue lefferts on christmas eve. the night i met lynn. lefferts' mother i.d.ed stensland as lefferts' boyfriend, but stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{stensland and meeks. what were they up to?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{johnny stompanato told me when meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when deuce perkins was shot. exley stensland and buzz meeks . two man triggers knocking off mickey cohen lieutenants. when they killed deuce perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{then something goes wrong. meeks gets killed. maybe stens got greedy, killed meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{the night he died, stens was all mysterious. said he had something big going down.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{the nite owl! stensland was going there to sell the heroin.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{somebody got wind of it, killed them all.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{it wasn't the negroes. the griffith park report was a phony. and, who says the purple merc was spotted outside the nite owl?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{dudley.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{the first guys to the car when jack and i got there were bruening and carlisle.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{dudley's guys.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{they didn't find the shotguns. they planted them.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{it all keeps coming back to dudley.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{it's dudley for the nite owl.}
<A>__{they just stare at each other a beat as it sinks in.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{pierce patchett figures in, too. that's the angle jack was working. dudley must work for patchett.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{let's just kill them.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{for jack, for stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. i've been trying to be smart. a detective. but killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{stay smart, bud. we build a case. we play by the rules.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{there are no rules! why the fuck are you doing this? the nite owl made you. you want to tear all that down.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{with a wrecking ball. you want to help me swing it?}
<A>__{bud smiles. for a second he likes exley.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{let's go see pierce patchett. run a good cop bad cop.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{which one are you and which one am i?}
