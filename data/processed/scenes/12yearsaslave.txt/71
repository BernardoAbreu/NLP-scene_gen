<L>__{exterior ford planation slave shack evening}
<A>__{ end of july, 1841 the slaves eat. all tired from a days work they conduct themselves in silence. all except for eliza who, slipping into permanent depression, as always weeps. the sound of her sobbing edging him up particularly after master ford's "over the years" observation. solomon finally snaps:}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{eliza. eliza, stop!}
<A>__{solomon goes to her, grabs eliza. she does not stop. as if to force the misery from her, solomon shakes eliza}
<B>__{violently.}
<C>__{solomon }
<D>__{stop it! stop!}
<C>__{eliza}
<D>__{it’s all i have to keeps my loss present.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{you let yourself be overcome by sorrow. you will drown in it.}
<C>__{eliza}
<D>__{have you stopped crying for your children? you make no sounds, but will you ever let them go in your heart?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{...they are as my flesh...}
<C>__{eliza}
<D>__{then who is distressed? do i upset the mistress and the master? do you care less for my loss than their well being?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{master ford is a decent man.}
<C>__{eliza}
<D>__{he is a slaver.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{under the circumstances }
<C>__{eliza}
<D>__{under the circumstances he is a slaver! christian only in his proclamations. separated me from my precious babies for lack of a few dollars. but you truckle at his boot }
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{eliza}
<D>__{you luxuriate in his favor.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{i survive. i will not fall into despair. woeful and crushed; melancholy is the yolk i see most. i will offer up my talents to master ford. i will keep myself hearty until freedom is opportune.}
<C>__{eliza}
<D>__{ford is your opportunity. do you think he does not know that you are more than you suggest? but he does nothing for you. nothing. you are no better than prized livestock. call for him. call, tell him of your previous circumstances and see what it earns you...solomon.}
<A>__{eliza uses solomon’s name quite pointedly as if to underscore his true self. solomon get her meaning. yet he says nothing. again, pointedly:}
<P>__{eliza (cont’d)}
<D>__{so, you’ve settled into your role as platt, then?}
<C>__{solomon}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{my back is thick with scars from}
<P>__{(more}
<C>__{solomon }
<D>__{protesting my freedom. do not accuse me }
<C>__{eliza}
<D>__{i accuse you of nothing. i cannot accuse. i too have done so many, many dishonorable things to survive. and for all of them i have ended up here... no better than if i had stood up for myself. father, lord and savior forgive me... forgive me. oh, solomon, let me weep for my children.}
<C>__{ford }
<D>__{at the same time came the disciples unto jesus, saying, who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?}
