<A>__{the light is on. david takes a deep breath. bad night. he picks up an empty coffee jar, sighs and goes into the pantry a full one. bean enters. he opens the refrigerator and he studies the food on offer. nothing he fancies ... then bingo! he sees a little plate of 3 strawberries. he eats one, then two, then pops the third into his mouth. it tastes a bit off, so he takes it out of his mouth, puts it back on the plate, closes the fridge door, and exits ... just as david comes out of the pantry. close on bean's hand as it comes round the door frame and turns off the light. david, on the move, stubs his toe on a chair. he groans in pain, limps to the fridge. he spots the lone, already sucked strawberry and pops it into his mouth.}
