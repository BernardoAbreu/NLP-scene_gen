<L>__{interior station manager garry's quarters}
<A>__{garry, macready, dr. copper, norris, bennings, blair and his assistant, fuchs, are present. the small norwegian video unit has been set up and its contents are being viewed on a tv screen. grainy, home movie ish, no sound. the proceedings are grim. shots of the norwegian's at work. others of them playing soccer on ice. generally the footage is a prosaic record of their day to day life. norris shuffles the bundle of notes dr. copper brought back with him.}
<C>__{norris}
<D>__{...seems they were spending a lot of time at a place four miles northeast of their camp.}
<C>__{garry}
<D>__{what were they involved in?}
<A>__{macready, working on the video machine, answers.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{little ice core drilling... some seismology... glaciology... same old shit we do.}
<A>__{the present footage is a shot of them all naked and probably drunk, holding a sign across their waists as they stand outdoors in super freezing weather.}
<C>__{bennings}
<D>__{how much more of this crap is there?}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{about nine more hours.}
<C>__{bennings}
<D>__{we can't learn anything from this.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{probably right.}
<A>__{macready turns on the light and shuts off the video machine. he then slides the portable tape deck across the table to dr. copper. they exchange a look.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{macready and i were listening to some of these cassettes on the way back.}
<P>__{(somberly)}
<D>__{like you gentlemen to hear it.}
<A>__{a norwegian voice drones on calmly, making verbal notes. norris shrugs.}
<C>__{bennings}
<D>__{what do you want from us?}
<C>__{macready}
<P>__{(flat)}
<D>__{just listen.}
<A>__{dr. copper fast forwards. the calm voice continues. and then a loud blast, followed by pounding. the sounds of confusion. voices. loud. frenetic. men's feet running up and down wooden floorboards. a gurgling. a hissing. screams. and then a screeching. more blasts mixed with the din of wild, carnage wrought cries. and then more screeching. a screeching unlike anything these men have ever heard. the men look from one another in silence as they listen. dr. copper turns it off.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{goes on like that quite awhile.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what do you gentlemen make of it?}
<C>__{garry}
<D>__{could be anything... men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...}
<C>__{norris}
<D>__{maybe the whole camp got bent... something they ate. what about food poisoning, doc?}
<A>__{dr. copper taps the tape deck pensively.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{maybe.}
<A>__{he glances at macready, and then back to the others.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{there's something else we want you to see.}
