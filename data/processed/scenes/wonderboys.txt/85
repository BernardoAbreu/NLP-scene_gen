<D>__{you stay there.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{what? ohhhh. is that... it?}
<A>__{crabtree cocks his head toward the reams of paper stacked on grady's desk.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{honestly, tripp. do you actually think i would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{gee, i don't know. crabs. i don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{sometimes we have to improvise.}
<C>__{grady}
<P>__{(ignoring him)}
