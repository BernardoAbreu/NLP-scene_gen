<A>__{shane falco, wearing his patched wetsuit, climbs out of his inflatable dinghy and flops onto the deck of his cabin cruiser. he looks cold and tired.}
<P>__{mcginty (o.s.)}
<D>__{you look like a swordfish i caught once.}
<A>__{shane jumps. mcginty is sitting in an old deck chair on the stern of the boat.}
<D>__{mcginty he hit the deck just like that.}
<A>__{shane studies his visitor.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{and you look like that coach from the seventies. from the redskins. mcginty. except you look a shitload older. mcginty the price of happiness. something to take the chill off?}
<A>__{he offers shane an elegant flask. shane takes it and drinks.}
<D>__{mcginty i'm running the redskins again. and i want you to quarterback 'em.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{no, man, i've been out way too long. mcginty what, three years since san diego dumped you? that's nothing. you're in shape, flopping around in the water like that.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{you know what my nickname was in san diego, don't you? mcginty sure. footsteps.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{as in, i hear 'em and i dump the ball. mcginty well, you didn't have much of a line to protect you.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{i got two concussions to prove it. mcginty that's why girls don't play the game.}
<A>__{mcginty drinks from his flask.}
<D>__{mcginty i scouted you when you were playing at ohio state. i told san diego they were probably making a mistake when they signed you.}
<C>__{shane}
<P>__{(truly shocked)}
<D>__{no kidding? mcginty oh, you had a lot of tools: a quick release. fast. a scrambler by nature. good downfield vision. but you got hurt a lot. and worst of all, you never could win the big game. what did you lose the sugar bowl by, your senior year? what, forty points?}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{forty five. and now you want to recruit me? mcginty a scrambling quarterback is gonna do real well in this new replacement environment. and to tell you the truth, i think i can help you with your biggest problem.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{okay. what's my biggest problem? mcginty courage. i think that sugar bowl took it all out of you.}
<A>__{there's a beat as shane looks away.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{i'm retired from football. mcginty yeah, and it looks like things have been going really well for you since.}
<A>__{shane doesn't meet mcginty's eyes.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{i like being here. it's quiet. i like being alone. mcginty yeah. no screaming crowds, that's for sure.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you know what separates the winners from the losers? gettin' back on the horse. the one that kicked you in the teeth. you're still young. you still got bags of talent. if you do well, who knows what will happen when the strike ends?}
<A>__{shane keeps staring out at the water.}
<D>__{mcginty you want me to tell you you're not going to get hurt? you know you will. no doubt about that. but, hell...}
<A>__{mcginty points to the boats in the harbor.}
<D>__{mcginty ... wouldn't you rather get hurt than scrape the shit off of other guys' toys?}
