<L>__{exterior new york city street day}
<A>__{mickey is walking up a west side street, his hands in his coat pockets. jazz plays in the background as he talks over the screen.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{gee, hannah's sweet. although, sometimes i still do get angry when i think of things. oh, what the hell. at least, i'm not paying child support.}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{oh, god, i hope there's nothing physically wrong with me, either.}
<A>__{mickey pushes open the outside door of dr. abel's office, as the movie cuts to the doctor's consultation room. the doctor is framed in the doorway, looking through a file cabinet.}
<C>__{dr. abel}
<P>__{(taking out mickey's file)}
<D>__{so what's the, uh, problem this time?}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{this time i really think i have something.}
<A>__{while mickey answers him offscreen, dr. abel turns and walks toward him. the camera follows the doctor's movements from the other side of the wall, obscuring him briefly. it moves across a dark examining room wall to a second doorway, where mickey sits on a stool, continuing to talk to the offscreen dr. abel.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(onscreen)}
<D>__{i mean, i'm absolutely convinced that that you know, i mean, it's not like that adenoidal thing, you know, where i didn't realize i had them out.}
<A>__{dr. abel walks back onscreen. both he and mickey are now seen through the second doorway. dr. abel sniffs and stands directly in front of the sitting mickey. he stares down at him as mickey talks.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(continuing, gesturing)}
<D>__{so, so, but it was when i was younger, so }
<C>__{dr. abel}
<P>__{(overlapping, interrupting)}
<D>__{you know, i saw your father this week about his sinus...}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(folding his arms on his chest)}
<D>__{mm hm.}
<C>__{dr. abel}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family. i mean, he's, you know, he's }
<C>__{dr. abel}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{you mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(rubbing his hands on his knees)}
<D>__{yes, a little dizziness, and i think, i think i'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear}
<P>__{(poking at his ears and gesturing)}
<D>__{...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n n n no. no, i'm sorry. it was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.}
<A>__{dr. abel chuckles.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(nodding and gesturing)}
<D>__{now i ca can't remember.}
<C>__{dr. abel}
<D>__{let's take a look.}
<A>__{an uptempo big band sound is heard as the movie cuts to mickey's examination, beginning with a close up of dr. abel using an otoscope to examine the ear of a nervous mickey. next is a hearing test. the film shows the doctors's hands turning the dials on a sonometer. mickey sits on a nearby high stool, large earphones on his head. he listens with such concentration that he squints his eyes. he holds up a finger in response to the sounds he hears in his headset. finally, the film shows dr. abel hitting a large turning fork with his finger. he puts the vibrating fork to mickey's ear. mickey, looking up at the offscreen doctor's face, nods. the music stops as the film cuts back to dr. abel's consultation room. dr. abel walks from the examining room, through the consultation room, to a second examining room across the way. he talks to the offscreen mickey as he walks.}
<C>__{dr. abel}
<D>__{well, i'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high decibel range of your right ear.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{really?!}
<A>__{dr. abel moves offscreen in the second examining room. the camera stays focused on the doorway to this room as the doctor and mickey talk offscreen.}
<C>__{dr. abel}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{no, i i've been perfectly healthy. you know me.}
<A>__{dr. abel briefly passes by the doorway.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{i always, i i always imagine that i have things.}
<C>__{dr. abel}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{when did you first notice this?}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{oh, uh, about a month ago. wha what do i have?}
<A>__{looking preoccupied, dr. abel walks back into the consultation room, holding mickey's open file. he strides over to his desk, revealing a frightened mickey, sitting in a chair opposite it. still standing, the doctor leans over the desk, his back to the camera, and makes a few notes in the file.}
<C>__{dr. abel}
<D>__{you've had some dizzy spells.}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{what about ringing and buzzing? have you, uh, noticed any of that?}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{yes, now now that you mention it, uh, i i i have, uh, buzzing and also ringing. ringing and buzzing. um, am i going deaf, or something?}
<C>__{dr. abel}
<P>__{(making more notes in the file)}
<D>__{and it's just in one ear?}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(picking at his fingers)}
<D>__{yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?}
<A>__{dr. abel chuckles as he closes mickey's file and straightens up. the camera looks past his back and shoulders to the anxious mickey.}
<C>__{dr. abel}
<P>__{(his face offscreen)}
<D>__{what i'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. i'd like to have them run some tests.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{the hospital? what kind of tests?}
<A>__{dr. abel lays his pen across mickey's closed file. he walks around his desk and sits on its edge close to mickey.}
<C>__{dr. abel}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{now, don't get alarmed. these are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than i can run here.}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{i mean, it's, it's nothing.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{well, if it's nothing, then why do i have to go into the hospital at all? i mean, uh, i hear perfectly fine, so i'm, so i'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels. so i, you know, i won't go to the opera.}
<C>__{dr. abel}
<P>__{(sniffing)}
<D>__{you know, there's no reason for panic. i just want to rule out some things.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{dr. abel}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{it's nothing. will you trust me?}
