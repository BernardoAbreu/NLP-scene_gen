<L>__{exterior hanalei bay day}
<A>__{the sun is higher, and the beach is growing populated. matt sits on the sand, glancing occasionally back toward the cottage. next to him lie his daughters and sid. suddenly two boys brian's kids come running through the hedge and past matt on their way into the water. matt turns around to see brian's wife julie speer dutifully trailing behind.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{stay in the zone, please! that means you, skylar. and you too, colt.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{skylar and colt?}
<A>__{matt watches the little boys flop into the surf. mrs. speer follows, wading in up to her calves. matt stands to look whether brian is coming down to the beach too. no such luck.}
<C>__{matt }
<P>__{(to alex)}
<D>__{i will be right back.}
<A>__{matt gets to his feet, brushes off sand, and walks casually toward mrs. speer, maintaining a comfortable distance. alexandra watches. in the surf matt takes up a casual stance near mrs. speer and pretends to look out at the water, just hanging out. mrs. speer continues to keep a watchful eye on her boisterous boys.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{looks like you got yourself a handful with those two.}
<C>__{julie}

<C>__{matt}

<C>__{julie}
<D>__{oh, no.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{she'll be fine.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{what's wrong? if you don't mind my asking.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{just a little boating accident. hit her head a little too hard.}
<A>__{does julie recognize any of this, or even recognize him? doesn't seem like it.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{a sailboat? or one with a motor?}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(laughs, then )}
<D>__{one with a motor.}
<A>__{she's actually sort of charming, this julie speer.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{well, good luck with that. i wish her well. skylar, don't go so far!}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you guys staying in one of the cottages over there?}

<D>__{yes, my husband had to come here for work, so we thought we'd all make a little vacation of it. he knows the owner, so }

<C>__{matt}
<D>__{he's my cousin.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{oh. then you probably know my husband. brian speer?}
<A>__{that hangs there a moment. matt suppresses the sudden desire to spill the beans.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{no, can't say as i do.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{oh, i just assumed, since he's been }
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{dad! dad, come here! something bit me!}
<A>__{matt looks over to see scottie very agitated about something.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{excuse me. nice talking to you.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{you too. take care.}
<A>__{matt trots off. a montage images of hanalei as the sun begins to set over the magnificent taro fields. wind rustles the trees. mist falls into the valley.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{how can i forgive her for loving someone else? did she even know about his family? was she that in love? does she miss him from her coma? does she wish he could be with her and not me?}
