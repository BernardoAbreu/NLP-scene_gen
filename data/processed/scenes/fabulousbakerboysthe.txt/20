<A>__{with the stand up under his arm, frank enters and closes the door quietly. a light is glowing in the kitchen. the rest of the house is dark, quiet. in the kitchen, he checks the message pad by the phone. nothing. on the table, a plate of cold chicken is waiting for him. next to it is a stack of bills with a note attached: "frank. please." frank sighs and leans the stand up against the wall. the photo of jack is peeling off the cardboard. finding a stack of glossies in a drawer, frank removes the old jack from the stand up and replaces it with a new one. as he presses the photograph in place, his eyes drift to the one of himself. it was taken a long time ago.}
