<A>__{curtis slams the doors behind them. it's pitch black until he gets to the switch on the lantern. the room fills with the orange glow as curtis snaps the padlock through the door handles.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{come on. it's okay.}
<A>__{curtis leads them through the entry to the larger section of the shelter. samantha takes hannah and sits with her on one of the cots. she's signing to her, trying to calm her down.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{it's okay. all right. come on. sit down.}
<A>__{curtis goes to a trunk in the corner and begins rooting through it. he removes two gas masks and an oxygen mask connected to a small tank. he goes over and kneels in front of hannah. he tries slipping the oxygen mask over her face. samantha grabs his wrist.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{no. don't do that.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{it's okay. it's oxygen. here. put this on.}
<A>__{curtis hands samantha a gas mask.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{are you kidding?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{please just do it. okay?}
<A>__{he looks to hannah and places an oxygen mask over her face..}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{there we go. all right. keep it out of your eyes. okay?}
<A>__{he signs to her.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{hey. i love you. it's okay.}
<A>__{curtis eases on the knob at the top of the tank. he climbs onto the cot and puts his arm around them. he slips on his gas mask. samantha is hesitant. she looks at her husband in the mask and leans back against the side of the container. hannah looks up at her. she touches her mother's mask. samantha slips on the gas mask. the camping lantern on the floor casts long shadows up. the faint boom of thunder rolls softly outside. the family sits huddled together on the cot, wearing their masks.}
