<L>__{interior duane's truck later}
<A>__{the flag poles over the cb unit are bare. duane is in the sleeper cab, his forearms bound to his thighs with duct tape. a telltale piece of confederate red fabric hangs out of his mouth. there is a purplish bruise on his forehead. he's quiet, but glowering at his captors.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{... so, at a rest stop outside logansport you noticed that two guys were slipping something extra in one of your cars, and you decided to see what it was. then you figured you'd take this valuable commodity and go into business yourself, even though it didn't belong to you. but you needed a crackerjack salesman to move it, so you made the biggest mistake of your short life and chose del. sound right so far?}
<A>__{duane nods.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{del's dead, by the way. i sent him to the great beyond.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{actually, i scalped him, and then you killed him.}
<A>__{duane narrows his eyes in disbelief.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{exactly.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now, the one thing i don't get is that we checked all the buicks on that lot. four '97 lesabres and nothing in 'em.}
<A>__{duane smiles mockingly.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{ohhh ... there weren't four, were there?}
<A>__{charlie reaches up above the visor and pulls down a rumpled manifest. he leafs through it.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{there were five, damn it! i should have known!! goddamn...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so, what happened to the fifth car?}
<A>__{duane shrugs his shoulders.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{you know you're going to die, don't you, duane?}
<P>__{(duane nods)}
<D>__{and you really don't know where that other lesabre is, do you?}
<A>__{duane shakes his head. charlie sighs, resigned.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{he's telling the truth. he doesn't know.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{should i kill him now?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{wait. any last words, general lee?}
<A>__{duane nods emphatically. wesley pulls the confederate flags out of his mouth.}
<C>__{duane}
<D>__{suck my dick, you yankee piece of shit.}
<A>__{he spits in wesley's face. charlie has to restrain wesley.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{god, i admire that. ya see that, wesley? that's why they get all the glory.}
<A>__{charlie climbs down from the big rig and heads across the parking lot. the town car is parked near the adjacent motel, just a few spaces away from betty's lesabre. with a furious calm wesley wipes his face, then takes out a can of lighter fluid, sets it on the dash and looks at duane.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{...why'd you spit on me?}
