"drugs yes! transplants no!" and "save our kids from the skids!" which is what they now chant: "save our kids! from the skids!" the demonstration moves through a handful of city cops where our original group of twenty still ramble around, chanting: "two four! help the poor!" holly pavilion, eighth floor the staff elevator doors open and bock comes out, wearing his long white doctor's coat unbuttoned. hanging about the nurses' station are dr. brubaker and a few young men in white. they come quickly to respectful attention at bock's entrance. clattering trays dominate the lunchtime atmosphere.}

"everybody lives with lies," i said. i grabbed him by his poncho, dragged him the full length of our seven room despicably affluent middle class apartment and flung him out. i haven't seen him since. but do you know what he said to me as he stood there on that landing on the verge of tears. he shrieked at me: "you old fink! you can't even get it up anymore!" that was it, you see. that was his real revolution. it wasn't racism and the oppressed poor and the war in vietnam. the ultimate american societal sickness was a limp dingus. hah!}

<A>__{throughout the scene, camera moves slowly in through the flesh and fury to an intense two shot of this terrified act of love. then slowly over bock's plunging shoulder to the woman's face. she gasps at the moment of penetration, then her lovely face slowly shapes into smiling serenity. bock sobs; even in the shadows we can see the path of the tears on his cheek.}
<B>__{abrupt silence.}
<A>__{outside the hospital, night. 4:00 a.m. the quiet, black streets glisten wetly in the puddles of lamplight. the steinmetz pavilion, tenth floor the night shift is finishing up. theresa campanella, r.n., a high strung girl in her early twenties, stands at a water tap holding a glass and popping some pills in her mouth. to the room:}
<C>__{campanella}
<D>__{well, i will see you.}
<B>__{tenth floor corridor. night}
<A>__{campanella comes out of the dialysis room, puts on her coat and walks to...}
<B>__{holly pavilion lobby. night}
<A>__{campanella moves down the empty corridor. all the doors are closed now; only the overhead light in the background of the corridor glows weakly. campanella puts a cigarette in her mouth, pauses to look for matches; she hasn't any. scowling with annoyance, she continues to the lobby and stops by a partially visible white jacketed figure reading a newspaper.}
<C>__{campanella}
<D>__{do you have a match, doctor?}
<A>__{she takes the matches, lights her cigarette, inhaling deeply, when he suddenly sandbags her from behind. she goes down. bock's office. daybreak, wednesday covered by bock's overcoat, barbara tosses and turns on the couch in a small nightmare. through the windows comes the first gray wash of dawn. full shot of barbara, awake and up on one elbow on the verge of a scream. she looks around the room. it is dark, empty, silent. across barbara looking through the door to the secretarial office. it is likewise dark, but suddenly the lights go on and, a moment later, bock enters. he holds a container of coffee in each hand and has something white draped over his forearm. from under bock's bulky coat, barbara watches him lumber to his desk, where he sets the containers of coffee down. he drops the whitish garment over the back of a chair and then sits. he hoists a bulging folder of correspondence from his filing tray and hunches to work, reading. after a moment, he regards the silent figure on the couch across the room.}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{you wouldn't be awake.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{what time is it?}
<A>__{he rises, picks up the second container and white dress from the chair. she reaches out an arm for the coffee. bock holds up a nurse's uniform.}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{i swiped this for you out of the nurses' locker room. i will make good on your dress. i'm afraid it's torn beyond repair. buy yourself a new one or, if you like, give me your size and i will send it on to you. but i want to talk to you about that.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{talk to me about what?}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{about your father. you really shouldn't move him in his condition. i just had a look at his chart. there's no reason to presume brain damage. you know as well as i you can't predict anything in these instances. he could pull out of that coma at any time. i think you should let him stay here. i will personally look after him.}
<A>__{he has perched on the edge of the couch, and she rests her cheek against the long, bent curve of his back, smiling.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{is this your way of saying you'd like me to stay in town a few more days?}
<A>__{he turns to look at her, smiles back.}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{well, that would be nice, too.}
<A>__{she sips her coffee.}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{what do you say, miss drummond?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i expect you can call me barbara, considering you ravished me three times last night.}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{three times?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{oh, look at him, pretending he didn't count. you were as puffed up as a toad about it. punched a couple of holes in your crusade for universal impotence, didn't it? i think we're on a first name basis by now. i will call you herb.}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{let's give your father a week, barbara, what do you say?}
<C>__{barbara}
<P>__{(a frown darkens her face)}
<D>__{no, i don't want my father in this hospital. i had a dream about this hospital.}
<P>__{(some of the terror shows on her face)}
<D>__{i dreamt this enormous starched white tile building suddenly erupted like a volcano, and all the patients, doctors, nurses, attendants, orderlies, the whole line staff, the food service people, the aged, the lame and you right in the middle were stampeding in one hideous screaming suicidal mass into the sea.}
<P>__{(she stares at him}
<D>__{wide eyed, reliving}
<P>__{the dream)}
<D>__{i'm taking my father out of here and as quickly as i can.}
<A>__{they stare at each other, she in terror, he with affection.}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{you're a real fruitcake, you know?}
<A>__{she sets her coffee down on the couch and decides to wear bock's overcoat rather than use it as a cover. she searches for the sleeves. bock assists her.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{well, let me put it this way. i love you. i fancied you from the first moment you came lumbering down that hallway upstairs. i said to mr. blacktree, "who's that hulking bear of a man?" the apaches are reverential about bears. they won't eat bear meat; they never skin bears. bear is thought of as both benign and evil, but very strong power. men with bear power are highly respected and are frequently said to be great healers.}
<A>__{by now she's standing, the overcoat reaching her toes. she looks down at bock perched on the couch.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i said to mr. blacktree, "that man gets his power from the bear."}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{swell. now, look, do you have a hotel, some sort of accommodations where you can stay for a week or so?}
<A>__{barbara reaches for her coffee, sips, moves around in her tent of a coat.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{all right, let me put it this way, herb. my father and i accept the implacability of death. if he dies, he dies, but i'm taking him out of here and back to mexico about one o'clock this afternoon. i want you to come with us, because i love you and want children.}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{i'm afraid mexico sounds a little too remote for me.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{we could use you down there, you know. there's a curiously high incidence of t.b. and you'd be a doctor again, herb. you'd be necessary again. if you love me, i don't see what other choice you have.}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{what do you mean, if i love you? i raped you in a suicidal rage. how did we get to love and children all of a sudden?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{oh, for heaven's sake, herb, i ought to know if a man loves me or not. you must have told me half a hundred times last night you loved me. you murmured it, shouted it; one time, you opened the window and bellowed it out into the street.}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{i think those were more expressions of gratitude than love.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{gratitude for what?}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{well, my god, for resurrecting feelings of life in me i thought dead.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{well, my god, what do you think love is?}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{okay, i love you, and you love me. i'm not about to argue with so relentless a romantic. well, then, since we have this great passion going for us, i don't see why you won't stay on here in new york for a week or ten days...}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{it's up to ten days now.}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{as long as it takes for your father's condition to improve.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{no. i've had these prophetic dreams for seven nights. seven is a sinister number. the meaning of these dreams is very clear, seven times as clear. i am to get my father and you out of this hospital before we are all destroyed.}
<C>__{bock}
<P>__{(throws up his hands)}
<D>__{you're certifiable! my god, half the time you're a perfectly intelligent young woman, and then suddenly you turn into a goddam cabalist who believes in dreams, witchcraft and bear power! and i don't like the way you dismiss my whole life as unnecessary. i do a lot of healing right here in manhattan. i don't have to go to mexico for it. i also teach. i send out eighty doctors a year into the world, sometimes inspirited, at least competent. i've built up one of the best damned departments of medicine in the world. we've got a hell of a heart unit here and a hell of a kidney group. a lot of people come into this hospital in big trouble, miss drummond, and go out better for the experience. so don't tell me how unnecessary i am.}
<C>__{barbara}
<P>__{(who's been slipping}
<D>__{into the nurse's}
<P>__{uniform)}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{so how come, eight hours ago, you were trying to kill yourself with an overdose of potassium?}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{where are you going now?}
<A>__{this last in reference to barbara crossing to the secretaries' office, zippering her uniform. bock's secretaries' office}
<C>__{barbara}
<P>__{(gathering her coat and purse)}
<D>__{my hotel. i have to check out. mr. blacktree doesn't speak any english.}
<C>__{bock}
<P>__{(from the connecting doorway)}
<D>__{well, you're coming back, of course.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{of course. i have to settle the bill here and pack my father. and i think you need a few hours alone to make your decisions.}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{what decisions?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{you're a very tired and very damaged man. you've had a hideous marriage and i assume a few tacky affairs along the way. you're understandably reluctant to get involved again. and, on top of that, here i am with the preposterous idea you throw everything up and go off with me to some barren mountains of mexico. it sounds utterly mad, i know. on the other hand, you obviously find this world as desolate as i do. you did try to kill yourself last night. so that's it, herb. either me and the mountains or the bottle of potassium. i will be back in an hour or so. i will be in my father's room.}
<A>__{she slips into her coat and exits, as bock looks after her thoughtfully, then turns back to his own office. bock's office he shuffles around distractedly, not knowing how to articulate the exuberance he feels. suddenly, he opens the window, leans out and bellows to the empty air.}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{all right. i love you!}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{my god!}
<A>__{first avenue, construction area. dawn a construction sign fills the screen. it reads on this location, the new york medical university center will build a drug rehabilitation community center, to be completed in}
