<L>__{ext day: vitelli cafe}
<A>__{now the little alpha drives into the village near vitelli's cafe. michael is, as ever, accompanied with his two bodyguards, though they are all dressed differently. they go up to the cafe...and sit with vitelli, who is talking and talking. michael looks at appolonia; who sits, respectfully quiet. she wears the gold necklace around her neck. dissolve }
<L>__{ext day: hilltop near vitelli home}
<A>__{michael and appolonia are walking through a hilltop path, seemingly alone, although a respectful distance apart. as the view pans with them, we notice that her mother and a half dozen aunts are twenty paces behind them, and ten paces further behind are calo and fabrizzio, their luparas on their shoulders. further up the hill, appolonia stumbles on a loose stone, and falls briefly onto michael's arm. she modestly regains her balance, and they continue walking. behind them, her mother giggles to herself. dissolve }
