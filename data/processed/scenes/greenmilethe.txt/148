<L>__{interior e block night}
<A>__{coffey sits quietly in his cell, a solitary firefly flitting in circles around his finger. paul and the men appear. the firefly flits away, vanishing through coffey's tiny window.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{hello, boss.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hello, john.}
<A>__{brutal unlocks his cell. paul enters.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i guess you know we're coming down to it now. another couple of days.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{is there anything special you'd like for dinner that night? we can rustle you up most anything.}
<A>__{coffey gives it some careful thought.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{meatloaf be nice. mashed taters with gravy. okra, maybe. i's not picky.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what about a preacher? someone you could say a little prayer with?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{don't want no preacher. you can say a prayer, if you want. i could get kneebound with you, i guess.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{me?}
<A>__{coffey gives him a look please.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{s'pose i could, if it came to that.}
<A>__{paul sits, working himself up to it:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{john, i have to ask you something very important right now.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{i know what you gonna say. you don' have to say it.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i do. i do have to.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{john, tell me what you want me to do. you want me to take you out of here? just let you run away? see how far you can get?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{why would you do such a foolish thing?}
<A>__{paul hesitates, emotions swirling, trying to find the right words.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{on the day of my judgement, when i stand before god, and he asks me why did i kill one of his true miracles, what am i gonna say? that is was my job? my job?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{you tell god the father it was a kindness you done.}
<P>__{(takes his hand)}
<D>__{i know you hurtin' and worryin', i can feel it on you, but you oughtta quit on it now. because i want it over and done. i do.}
<A>__{coffey hesitates now he's the one trying to find the right words, trying to make paul understand:}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{i'm tired, boss. tired of bein' on the road, lonely as a sparrow in the rain. tired of not ever having me a buddy to be with, or tell me where we's coming from or going to, or why. mostly i'm tired of people being ugly to each other. i'm tired of all the pain i feel and hear in the world ever' day. there's too much of it. it's like pieces of glass in my head all the time. can you understand?}
<A>__{by now, paul is blinking back tears. softly:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes, john. i think i can.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{there must be something we can do for you, john. there must be something you want.}
<A>__{coffey thinks about this long and hard, finally looks up.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{i ain't never seen me a flicker show.}
