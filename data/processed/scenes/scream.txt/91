<C>__{gale}
<D>__{are all the local boys as sweet as you?}
<A>__{dewey blushes. he starts to say something when headlights appear behind them. they both spin as two cars loaded with kids come racing right at them. dewey grabs gale and pushes her off the road... just as the cars speed by, oblivious to them.}
