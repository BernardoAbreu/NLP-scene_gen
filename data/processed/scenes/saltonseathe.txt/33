<A>__{danny and tanner sitting across from one another at a picnic table. tanner writing serial numbers down as he counts out several hundred}
<B>__{dollar bills.}
<A>__{danny watching silently. tanner puts the bills in an envelope, licks the flap, seals it and slides it over to danny, who doesn't touch it. the envelope lays there between them for the following conversation.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you think i'm a judas?}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{hard to compare the people you're taking down with the lord.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{garcetti thinks i'm a pile of shit.}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{garcetti thinks everything is shit. he doesn't even like dolphins.}
<A>__{danny smiles.}
<C>__{tanner }
<D>__{i'm serious. he hates 'em. you ever hear of anyone who didn't like dolphins?}
<A>__{tanner shakes his head and smiles.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{thanks for not judging me.}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{it's not my place.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{don't you wonder why i do it?}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{the money? the drugs? keeping yourself out of jail? i know the drill.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you don't find that repugnant?}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{just the way the world works. look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy. you never hurt anyone but yourself as far as i know.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{tell that to bobby ... and his wife and kid.}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{bobby laid his own tracks. he could have gone quietly but he played the hard ass con till the end. and as far as i'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now take the money.}
<A>__{danny stuffs the money into his jacket.}
<C>__{tanner }
<D>__{one think i do want to know is how the hell did you get yourself into this position to start with? you seem like a smart enough guy.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{it's a long story. maybe i will tell you all about it some day.}
<A>__{garcetti emerges from the men's room, zipping up.}
<C>__{danny }
<D>__{hey, garcetti ... you ever get confused and try to flush yourself? garcetti}
<P>__{(all business)}
<D>__{you tell him?}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{i was getting to it.}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(to tanner)}
<D>__{tell me what?}
<C>__{garcetti}
<D>__{i will tell him.}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{tell me what?}
<A>__{garcetti sits down next to danny. sighs.}
<C>__{garcetti}
<P>__{(mock concern)}
<D>__{danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember domingo, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{yeah. what about him?}
<C>__{garcetti}
<D>__{turns out he's connected.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{to who?}
<C>__{garcetti}
<D>__{the mexicali boys}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{and what does this have to do with me?}
<A>__{garcetti puts his hand on danny's shoulder, really playing it up.}
<C>__{garcetti}
<D>__{he knows somebody ratted him.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{garcetti}
<D>__{and he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a colombian necktie on whoever it was.}
<A>__{garcetti leans in close}
<C>__{garcetti }
<D>__{you know that thing where they slit your throat and pull your tongue out of the hole.}
<A>__{danny knocks garcetti's hand away and stands up. garcetti stalks him.}
<C>__{garcetti }
<D>__{apparently they call it a necktie because it hangs down about yay long and looks very similar to a tie. isn't that weird, danny? isn't that weird?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{shut up, garcetti!}
<A>__{danny turns to tanner}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{if he finds out it's me, i'm a dead man.}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you. domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people.}
<A>__{danny paces back and forth.}
<C>__{tanner }
<D>__{and if you're that worried about it, maybe you ought to get out of town.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{how the hell am i gonna do that? you guys are still stringing me a long on that possession charge.}
<C>__{garcetti}
<P>__{(mock surprise)}
<D>__{you mean that hasn't been cleared up yet?}
<A>__{garcetti chuckles at danny's fear}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{fuck you, garcetti. i been at this for almost a year. i've done everything you guys have asked of me.}
<C>__{garcetti}
<D>__{anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart ass all the time?}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{look, we'll talk to the a.d.a.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{soon. i promise. we'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear. in the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.}
