<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{pete flies down a steep hill going crazy fast. close up of his front wheel shaking. it is as if he wants to crash. he rides down the street when suddenly a man in a range rover opens his door to exit his car and pete slams directly into the man's car door hard, breaking the man's window and falling to the ground. the man is an incredibly thick fifty five year old.}
<C>__{man in range rover}
<D>__{are you fucking kidding me?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you opened your door on me.}
<C>__{man in range rover}
<D>__{i didn't open my fucking door on you. i opened my door!}
<A>__{pete slowly gets to his feet.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i was right there! you are supposed to look before you open your door. i was in the fucking bike path.}
<C>__{man in range rover}
<D>__{that's a blind spot. there's no fucking bike path. this is a residential section. get your head out of your ass.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{pay attention!}
<C>__{man in range rover}
<D>__{open your god damn eyes. what are you doing, sleepwalking?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you're supposed to look to see if a biker is coming through. you're supposed to look!}
<C>__{man in range rover}
<D>__{it's not my job to look out for you. you look out for yourself. i don't look out for you. i don't see you. i don't now where the fuck you are and what you're doing.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{no one is ever looking out for me!}
<C>__{man in range rover}
<D>__{i need your name and number.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{man in range rover}
<D>__{because you're going to pay for my door.}
