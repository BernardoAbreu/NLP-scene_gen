<A>__{anarchy 99 seals the door, locking the crew away. they slap five and bump chests, still totally amped up.}
<L>__{exterior ship late afternoon}
<A>__{angle on a large submersible vehicle. it's white and twelve feet long. there are motors on either side and a panel of solar cells on the top of a periscope like projection rising from the back. this is the ahab device. it sits in the wet well at the back of the ship, ready to be launched out the back sea doors.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{ready the boat.}
<A>__{there is a smaller boat moored to the back of the ship. kirill and viktor hop onto it's deck. they start to whistle as they work. sounds like the "andy griffith" theme. xander's binoculars p.o.v. he takes digital photos of the ahab device.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{what the hell are you guys stealing?}
<B>__{back on the ship}
<A>__{the smaller boat is launched and ready to do. yorgi goes to the wet well controls and hits a switch. the aft doors open, letting water into the wet well. in seconds ahab starts to float. anders loosens it from it's moorings and they tie ahab to the back of the smaller boat.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{ready.}
<A>__{yorgi hits another switch, opening the ballast doors on the port side of the ship. air flows out, causing the ship to list to one side.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{it all happened so fast. such an unfortunate accident.}
<A>__{yorgi machine guns the wet well control panel.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{they climb onto the boat. petra is the last to board. she looks up towards xander and machine guns the panel some more, making sure he notices. xander's p.o.v. he sees the smaller boat pulling away, the ahab device being towed behind. he pans over and zooms in on the shot up control panel.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{what the hell...?}
<A>__{he pans over to the wet well and sees it's flooding. with the ballast open on only one side, the ship starts listing. the thing is going down. he pans over, clicks into "penetrator" mode, and sees the crew pounding on the walls below decks. they're trapped, their wrists and ankles bound with plexi cuffs.}
