<T>__{star of david wipe to:}
<L>__{exterior north pole day}
<A>__{the hammer and mo crawl onto the snow covered bluff overlooking santa's workshop. with his binoculars, the hammer scopes out the compound below. binocular pov instead of your standard two circles filling the screen, we see the world through a pair of star of davids. the place resembles the exterior of an industrial warehouse, with two elves on guard with guns.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{it's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.}
<C>__{mohammed}
<D>__{i wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of santa's workshop? we've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.}
<A>__{the hammer puts the binoculars down.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{this is the year 5734. it's time the boys at the klf got into the 58th century. let me show you something.}
<A>__{the hammer pulls out a laptop computer.}
<C>__{hammer }
<D>__{the jdl supplies all its agents with this state of the art device called a laptop computator.}
<C>__{mohammed}
<D>__{cool. what's it do?}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the internet, i can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.}
<A>__{the hammer makes a few keystrokes and turns the screen towards mo.}
<C>__{mohammed}
<D>__{man, that's far out! hey, the jets won!}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{but wait, there's more. with a few swift clicks of this hand computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, i can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e mail.}
<A>__{mo's interest is seriously peaked.}
<C>__{mohammed}
<D>__{porno? you're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{oh yeah. take a look.}
<A>__{the hammer does some computing.}
<C>__{hammer }
<D>__{for example, here's a picture of your sister tawanda getting freaky with a german shepard.}
<A>__{mo's eyes widen.}
<C>__{mohammed}
<D>__{gettin' freaky with a what?}
<A>__{he grabs the laptop from the hammer and looks at the screen. a picture of tawanda making out with a german man decked out in lederhosen on a rural german hillside. the two are surrounded by sheep. mo gives a sigh of relief.}
<C>__{mohammed }
<D>__{oy vey, that's almost as bad. that's tawanda getting freaky with a notorious white supremacist.}
<A>__{mo goes for the keyboard.}
<C>__{mohammed }
<D>__{where's the white out button on this thing?}
<A>__{we get a cu of the enter key as mo presses it. a soothing computerized female voice purrs...}
<C>__{computerized female voice}
<D>__{message sent.}
<C>__{mohammed}
<D>__{what just happened?}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{remember that bit about the cyber postal route?}
<C>__{mohammed}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{the hammer looks at the blissfully ignorant mo with empathy.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{nah, forget about it.}
