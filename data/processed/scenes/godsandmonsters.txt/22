<L>__{exterior whale's house backyard day}
<A>__{kay clears his throat softly.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{mr. whale?}
<A>__{whale smiles politely to cover his momentary disorientation.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{your father was a schoolmaster?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{of course. i attended eton it wouldn't do for a master's son to attend where his father taught. i was to go up to oxford but the war broke out and i never made it. the great war, you know. you had a good war, but we had a great one.}
<A>__{he glances to see if the boy smiles at the quip.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you can't imagine what life was like after the armistice. the twenties in london were one long bank holiday, a break from everything dour and respectable. i had a knack with pencil and paper, so i was hired to design sets for stage productions.}
<A>__{hanna comes down the path with the tray. she places it on the table.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{thank you, hanna. very nice.}
<A>__{hanna remains planted next to the table.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you can go now.}
<A>__{she makes an audible sigh and starts back up the hill.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{there was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "journey's end". every experienced director turned it down, so i offered myself, bullying and begging for the job. "journey's end" made the careers of everyone associated with it. it was only a matter of time until hollywood beckoned.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{how much longer before we get to "frankenstein"?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{am i correct in assuming, mr. kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{oh no, i want to hear everything. you made twenty pictures in all }
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{twenty one. the romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking. the horror pictures were trifles. grand guignol for the masses.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{but it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.}
<A>__{an abrupt look of anger flashes across whale's face.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i am not dead yet, mr. kay.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{no. i never said you were. or will be soon.}
<A>__{kay leans over the steno pad, determined to be more worthy.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{so. "journey's end" brought you to hollywood }
<A>__{whale takes in the boy's blank, bored expression. he sighs.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i have a proposal, mr. kay. this mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{i don't mind.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{let's make it more interesting. i will answer any question you ask. but, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing.}
<A>__{kay's mouth pops open.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{that's funny, mr. whale.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{it is, isn't it? my life as a game of strip poker. shall we play?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{you're serious.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{quite.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{then the rumors are true?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{what rumors might those be?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{that you were forced to retire because, uh a sex scandal.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{a homosexual scandal, you mean? for me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.}
<A>__{kay just sits there, squinting and grinning.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{you're a dirty old man.}
<A>__{whale tilts his head as if brushing off a compliment. kay kicks off his penny loafers, bends over to remove his socks.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you are kind to indulge your elders in their vices. as i indulge the young in theirs.}
<A>__{two pale feet emerge. whale leans forward to examine them. he leans back again.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{no. there was no scandal.}
<A>__{and he reaches into his coat for a cigar. whale's hand trembles as he slices a hole at the base, then lights the cigar with a wooden match, sucking and rotating until the tip is roundly lit.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{my only other vice. i suppose you'd like a fuller answer to your question.}
<A>__{kay nods.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{it will cost you your sweater.}
<A>__{kay hesitates a moment, then sets his pen aside to pull the sweater over his head, revealing a sleeveless t shirt.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{too warm for a sweater, anyway.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you must understand how hollywood was twenty years ago. nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers. outside of hollywood, who knows who george cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along santa monica?}
<A>__{kay stares at him in disbelief.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{george cukor? who made "a star is born"? i never guessed.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{take off your vest and i will tell you a story.}
<A>__{kay plucks at his t shirt, glancing toward the house.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{don't be shy. there's time to stop before you go too far.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{i guess.}
<A>__{kay peels off the shirt and tosses it on his shoes and sweater.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{george is famous for his saturday dinner parties. great artists, writers, society folk, all rubbing elbows with hollywood royalty. but how many of those oh so proper people know about the sunday brunches that follow? gatherings of trade eating leftovers, followed by some strenuous fun and frolic in the pool.}
<P>__{(flicks an ash)}
<D>__{if a goat like that can continue about his business, my more domestic arrangements could've raised very few eyebrows.}
<A>__{the revelation seems to have left kay a little shaken. he flips to a blank page.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{can we talk about the horror movies now?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{certainly, mr. kay. is there anything in particular you want to know?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{will you tell me everything you remember about making "frankenstein"?}
<A>__{he glances down at his few remaining articles of clothing.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{can that count as one question?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{i can't believe i'm doing this.}
<A>__{kay stands to unbuckle his belt, glancing around the yard again. he unzips and steps out of his sharply creased flannel legs. his thighs are thin and pale.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{just like going swimming, isn't it?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{maybe you'd like a swim when we're through. i never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{okay. "frankenstein." tell me everything.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{righto. let me see.}
<A>__{whale swallows a wince, trying to block the pain pushing against his skull.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly i mean badly, not baldly. i was given the pick of stories being developed, and i picked that one.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{who came up with the monster's makeup and look?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{my idea. muchly. my sketches. big heavy brow. head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{he's one of the great images of the twentieth century. as important as the mona lisa.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you think so? that's very kind }
<A>__{whale clutches at the air, suddenly notices that his hand is empty. he looks down and sees the cigar on the flagstones.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{boris karloff. where did you find him?}
<A>__{whale bends down to retrieve his cigar and the change of gravity drives a spike through his skull.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{karloff, mr. whale. how did you cast him?}
<A>__{whale turns toward the froggy voice.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{please. excuse me. i must go lie }
<A>__{he forces himself up with one hand. kay finally looks up, notices whale's colorless lips and desperate eyes.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{mr. whale? are you all right?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i just need to lie down. studio. daybed in studio.}
<A>__{whale lurches from the table. kay jumps forward, catching him under an arm.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{oh my god. what's wrong, mr. whale? is it your heart?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{head. not heart.}
<A>__{he leans against kay, who leads him toward the studio.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{forgive me.}
