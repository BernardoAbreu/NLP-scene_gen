<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it's not more than one person. i'm telling you who the hell it is!}
<C>__{joan }
<D>__{but i don't think red would have someone sing into my answering machine...}

<A>__{joan sticks her head out door.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{it doesn't seem like something he'd do.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{dammit, joan!!}
<A>__{she steps out of the closet and comes toward the bedroom, dressed in one of andy's negligees.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{god, what is this?! i can't say anything to you anymore, you're so darn touchy!}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you can mention anything you want, honey. i'm just trying to keep you from turning up face down, that's all.}

<C>__{harry }
<D>__{i mean, i can't leave you up here alone now...}

<C>__{joan}
<D>__{it's andy's }

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yes you do.}
<A>__{after a brief moment:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{well?}
<A>__{he remains seated, looking at her. she reaches to the answering machine on the night stand, disconnects it, then once again looks over at him. he gets up and comes over to the bed and reaches a hand down to touch the side of her face. she looks up at him: she takes his hand, he sits down on the bed beside her and they begin to make love.}
