<L>__{interior world of donuts day}
<A>__{simon is asleep with his head down on the table. he wakes finally and sees... henry sitting across from him, gripping a beer and reading the poem. he finishes, shuts the book and drinks.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{listen. i know a man. he's a big shot in the publishing business. angus james. smart, adventurous and tons of integrity. when this thing is ready, i will recommend he reads it. he'll respect my opinion.}
<A>__{simon takes this in, then looks down at his hands and proceeds carefully.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{a man was here today looking for you.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(alert)}
<D>__{what man?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i don't know. he drove by the house a few times.}
<A>__{henry throws his eyes heavenward and pulls his hair. jumping to his feet, he paces maniacally.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{why do they torment me like this? why? they're like a bunch of fucking mosquitoes!}
<A>__{a customer a few tables away gets nervous and leaves.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{what do they want from you?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{they want to suffocate me, simon! they wanna extinguish me like a flame!}
<A>__{some kid named tim, sitting at another table, turns around and asks...}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{but why?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{they're afraid, that's why! they're afraid of what i might do! what i might say! think! they're afraid of my ideas!}
<A>__{he drinks, then returns and sits beside simon.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{you and i are alike in this way, simon.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{we're outsiders. we think and feel too much and too deeply. and the world can't handle that. our mere existence is a threat to its illusion of security. sure, they'll name a wing of a new library after us when we're dead! but now... now, when we're alive... now, they wanna burn us at the stake!}
<A>__{he drinks, burps, then slams down the can. he glances over at tim who is still looking on.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{scram.}
<A>__{tim hesitates, but then obeys. he gets up and leaves. henry returns to simon.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{for example, i made love to your mother about half an hour ago and now i'm beginning to think that maybe it wasn't such a good idea.}
<A>__{simon blinks. henry adds...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i mean to say, i think fay may be jealous.}
<A>__{simon is deeply confused. he looks ill. he stands and takes a few steps away, staring at the floor.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i don't want to think about this.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{bad move, simon.}
<A>__{simon stops and looks at him.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(pointing at him)}
<D>__{a poet has got to be able to think about anything.}
<A>__{simon pauses, then comes closer to henry and stops.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{am i really a poet?}
<A>__{henry jumps up, strides around the store and speaks at the top of his voice.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{of course you are! a great poet! but you need experience. you need to do something to be ashamed of every once in a while, for cryin' out loud.}
<A>__{he walks to the door.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{come on! let's go out! there's a den of iniquity right across the street! you got any money?}
<A>__{he strides out of the store. simon stands there, stunned and looks at mr deng as the old man wipes off the table with a wet rag.}
