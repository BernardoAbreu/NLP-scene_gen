<A>__{cops and mobsters sit shoulder to shoulder, cigar smoke like l.a. haze as lee charges bucky, the big man trying to cut of the ring. bucky engages, dodging lee's thundering blows and peppering back with counterpunches... the general fight storyline is this: a very even and brutal match see sawing back and forth, bucky doing all he can to make it into the middle rounds. somewhere around the fourth or fifth round his competitive juices take over and he begins trying to win at all costs. the two men hurt each other badly, and in the eighth round it's anybody's fight. bucky punches toe to toe with lee, abandoning his strategy. lee knocks bucky out.}
