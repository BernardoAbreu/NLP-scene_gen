<L>__{exterior temporary camp day}
<A>__{the band's best hunters, two dozen of them, are making ready to chase the buffalo. it's the big time, no event is more important. the villagers mostly women, children, and elderly have gathered around each of the hunters. the largest audience has gathered around lieutenant dunbar and wind in his hair. wind in his hair's pony is ready. great bolts of yellow lightning adorn his shoulders and rump. right now the warrior is drawing the same design along cisco's rump. dunbar reads this correctly as a great honor and stands by silently. wind in his hair is finished. he looks at dunbar and nods at the paint as if asking for a response.}
