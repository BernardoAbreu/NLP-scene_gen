<A>__{reese is out the window to the waist, aiming double handed. he fires. once. twice. again. they enter an interchange. ahead lies a long, sweeping curve, two lanes wide and elevated. terminator rocks back from a round between the eyes that bares metal, the fires. bullets rake the pickup. the windows are blown out. the side mirror explodes. reese is hit. drops the .357. sarah screams and weaves, barely in control.}
