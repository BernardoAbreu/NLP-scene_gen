<L>__{interior meeting room night}
<A>__{voices, confusion. about fifty people are jammed into the low ceilinged meeting room, all of them talking at once. they are pioneers, men and women of all ages and many races, a hardy, weathered looking group dressed in plain clothes of muted color. their faces seem to have been etched by the wind with deep lines, the skin burnished, and even the younger ones have crow's feet around the eyes from squinting. as they chatter excitedly, asking each other what happened, who found him, where, and so on, a sharp faced fifty ish woman, hawkins, is standing behind a table in the front of the room, calling for order.}
<C>__{hawkins}
<D>__{please! quiet, please!}
<A>__{just as the hubbub finally dies down, a grizzled pioneer named slade bellows loudly at her.}
<C>__{slade}
<D>__{just tell me one thing! how many of them are there and are they armed?}
<A>__{hawkins stares slade down, refusing to speak until she has real silence. when she finally speaks, her voice is calm and controlled.}
<C>__{hawkins}
<D>__{there in a man...one man. he was found in the trench by several children...}
<A>__{a sudden murmur dies away quickly under hawkins' hard stare.}
<C>__{hawkins}
<D>__{this man was not armed.}
<A>__{a murmur goes through the crowded room, then a woman named elise speaks over the hum of voices...}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{how could there only be one? how could he get here?}
<A>__{hawkins glances toward mace, a muscular, bearded man, about thirty.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{he was unconscious. we couldn't ask him anything. he }
<A>__{a commotion in the back room causes mace to break off as jimmy pig, a clean shaven burly looking pioneer in his thirties, pushes his way in, followed by four more pioneers. all five of then are wearing their huge hooded parkas, strange eskimo type wind goggles, and carrying weapons.}
<C>__{jimmy pig}
<D>__{nothin' out there. we couldn't see nobody, couldn't see no ship, no vehicles, nothin'...plus the wind's up again real strong.}
<A>__{an excited hubbub. hawkins is trying to restore order when slade shouts over the commotion.}
<C>__{slade}
<D>__{they're hiding, i bet.}
<A>__{hawkins ignores him as she speaks with firm authority.}
<C>__{hawkins}
<D>__{let's everybody calm down right now!}
<P>__{(beat; silence; then)}
<D>__{we have an injured man among us. one man. a traveler. unarmed.}
<P>__{(another pause; then)}
<D>__{we all want to do the decent thing. the decent thing is to help him. mace's wife, sandra, is looking after him now. now, i'd like a vote of support on this course of action from all of you.}
<A>__{the way she says it, you know she's used to getting her way, and, in fact, pioneers are exchanging glances and nodding when slade shouts again.}
<C>__{slade}
<D>__{you keep an eye on him, mace! you watch him!}
