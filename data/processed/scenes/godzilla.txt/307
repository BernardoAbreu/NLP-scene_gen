<A>__{opens his mighty jaw about to clamp down on them. the missiles connect, slamming into his chest, exploding. his torso, rips apart. he screams out. his wail a painful death cry. his foot stomps down as he tries to retain balance. the impact of the stomp acts like a shockwave that knocks the cab into a spin. slamming into the guard rail, the cab bounces back into the road and keeps going. the injured godzilla bites the bullet and continues pursuing, his gait slowing. the cab is able to make some distance. angle f 18 squadron again they fire. a group of missiles darting out.}
