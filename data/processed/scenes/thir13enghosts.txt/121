<L>__{interior great hall}
<A>__{the chanting is echoing through the house. the ocularis has begun to spin with kathy and bobby still seated in the center. one of the outer rings is slowly circling around them, when it suddenly lifts up, swirling around them like a blade.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{kathy!}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{don't look!}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i don't wanna look!}
<A>__{then the second outer ring flaps up next, and begins spinning in the opposite direction. arthur appears in the doorway to the great hall. the kids spot him.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{dad!!}
<A>__{arthur sees their predicament. raises his glasses. along with them are the ghosts surrounding the kids, each standing next to their symbols along the outermost ring.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{daddy... get us out of here...}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{just don't move.}
<A>__{arthur approaches the outer ring, just as a third inner ring flaps up, spinning in yet another direction, creating the combination of a meat grinder and a mixer. the ocularis is working its way closer to the kids the kids slouch down.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{make it stop, dad! make it stop!}
