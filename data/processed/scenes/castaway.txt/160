<A>__{chuck holds his surgeon's saw over the stump. he walks to another tree and begins to saw his way into the trunk.}
<L>__{exterior beach series of shots}
<A>__{up above the high tide line, chuck lashes a log to a row of five logs already joined with vines.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{no more waiting. take action.}
<A>__{chuck sews several designer dresses together with needle and suturing thread for a sail.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{that's right. take action.}
<A>__{he cuts bamboo for the mast. he carves driftwood for an oar. he fills gourds with water, stores breadfruit and coconut as he sings "fly me to the moon" to himself. he ties the sail to the mast and extends it with a bamboo boom lashed on with palm fiber and video tape. he ties on the doctor's kit and the fedex box with the angel wings. he examines his handiwork: a finished raft. he brings out his old life preserver and puts it on, then grabs hold of one corner of the raft to pull it down to the beach. it doesn't budge. he tries to pull it again. nothing. he leans his back into it and pushes with his legs. nothing. he collapses on the beach, his breath coming in heaves.}

<A>__{he bangs himself on the head, over and over.}
