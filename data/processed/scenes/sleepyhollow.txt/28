<L>__{exterior sleepy hollow forests, further on morning}
<A>__{brom and baltus stand at a horse's corpse amongst jagged boulders. the flesh has been stripped, guts exposed. philipse and ichabod arrive and dismount.}
<C>__{baltus}
<D>__{was this jonathan's?}
<C>__{brom}
<D>__{yes. seems he panicked across here and broke two legs.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{who took the meat?}
<C>__{baltus}
<D>__{must have been the redman. a lenape indian lives in the western woods.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{these woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and indians living there.}
<A>__{brom climbs up onto his own horse, a black beauty.}
<C>__{brom}
<D>__{there's only one lenape. he eats small animals and lost children... and the occasional constable when he can get it.}
<A>__{brom rides. ichabod goes to the dead horse, digs in his satchel for a thin iron tool, which he uses it to pry off one horseshoe. a whistle is heard o.s. everyone looks far ahead to where van ripper has ridden. the doctor and others are there. van ripper waves.}
