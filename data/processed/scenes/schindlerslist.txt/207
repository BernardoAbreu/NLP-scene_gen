<A>__{mila and another woman cross back toward their barracks carrying a large heavy pot of broth. not more than a hundred meters away stand the birch trees and crematoria, the smoke pluming even now, at night out of the darkness appear "apparitions," skeletal figures which surround the two women, or rather the soup pot between them, dipping little metal cups into it, over and over. too startled to speak, mila can only stare. the apparitions clamor around the pot a moment more, than furtively slip back into the same darkness from which they came. mila and the other woman exchange a glance. the pot is empty.}
