<L>__{exterior dance hall night}
<A>__{couples drift off the building's porch and into the street to cool off, smoke, and take a few hits off paper bags. john leans against the brick wall, tugs liberally from his paper bag, and exchanges war hoops with some friends across the street. he passes the bag to katherine and thomas.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so how's our star pupil feeling today?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{mary? the school doctor came by. declared it "non specific gastrointestinal disorder".}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{latin for "i don't have the slightest fucking idea".}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{will she be able to talk with me?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{that's up to her.}
<P>__{(to john)}
<D>__{mary's grandmother called a hand trembler.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{uh oh. hocus pocus time.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{is that serious?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{depends what the hand trembler says. people call them in when they think a witch or a yei is trying to sprinkle corpse sickness in their hogan, or if the night people have been hanging around too much. night people screw around a lot, but they're good at warning of evil ghosts.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{who are the night people?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{they come as coyotes.}
