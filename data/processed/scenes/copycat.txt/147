<A>__{he pushes the coffee toward the kid, who whips nikko's gun out from under the desk, where it was hidden, and lays it up under ruben's ear. kid moves behind ruben and puts a skinny arm around ruben's neck, pulling him upright. ruben still clutching the doughnut box. it takes a moment for the others to see. then the room is absolutely motionless.}

<A>__{then the kid throws the gun away, and stands, his hands up in surrender, a grin on his face. this entire action has taken about six seconds. the kid goes down, flattened by}
