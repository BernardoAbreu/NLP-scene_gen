<T>__{smash cut to:}
<A>__{a long stretch of pristine country road the hamptons day a silver mercedes convertible bursts into frame. harry's behind the wheel, shades, smoking a cigar, livin' large. next to him sits a thoroughbred of a girl. an "it" girl. smart, sexy and built for fun. she has perfected flirting to an art. her hand rests on harry's neck. there's a good thirty year age difference between them. her name is marin. she sings along with ja rule, now coming from a cd.}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{( singing)}
<D>__{to all my thugs that be livin' it up, we say, what i do. to all my...}
<P>__{(stops)}
<D>__{oh! this is it. make a right.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(admiring the neighborhood)}
<D>__{so baby, you're rich... .}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{well, my mother is, sort of. not really...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{if she lives within a mile of here, she's rich.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{i guess a hit play will buy you a house in the hamptons.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'd like to meet your mother.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{no you wouldn't. i mean, she's great. she's totally brilliant, but she's not your type.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you're overlooking one of the great things about me. i don't have a type.}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(very directly)}
<D>__{she's over thirty.}
<A>__{harry looks to marin, feigning hurt.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{oh, what?! like you don't know you have a slight reputation for...}
<A>__{just then the car phone rings. harry keeps looking at marin.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{ for what?}
<A>__{harry waits. ringgg! he doesn't look away.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{for never dating anyone over 30. don't look at me like that.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it's just not true.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{okay. sorry. over 31?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh, so you wait 'til we get out to the hamptons to let me know you're a wise ass.}
<P>__{(answers phone)}
<D>__{hold on. . .}
<P>__{(then to marin)}
<D>__{it just so happens, my dear, that women of a certain age, don't date me. you ever think of it that way? no, it's always me. you dames are all alike.}
<P>__{(then into phone)}
<D>__{hey...}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(amused, to herself)}
<D>__{dames...}
<A>__{marin continues singing along with ja rule as harry confidently slips his hand onto her thigh.}
<C>__{barry}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{vh huh.. .i will call back monday. who else? monday... monday... say you couldn't find me. who?}
<P>__{(glances at marin, she's not listening)}
<D>__{i will call her later. no, i have it.}
<A>__{harry hangs up, doesn't look in marin's direction to see if' she caught that. this brand of cool is about not playing that card. marin turns toward him, she has been listening. they've reached the end of the road, sand dunes, long lilting grass and the ocean stretch before them.}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(all business)}
<D>__{make a right, left at the second fence.}
<A>__{marin turns up the cd, getting herself out of whatever just came over her, looks out the window.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{have i mentioned how gorgeous your breasts look in this sweater?}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(blushing)}
<D>__{yes you have actually.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{so it would be too much to mention it again. . .}
<A>__{marin laughs, softening, as harry turns down a dirt driveway, driving toward a dream beach house.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{wow. it's the perfect beach house.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{i know. my mother doesn't know how to do things that aren't perfect.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{which explains you.}
<A>__{that got her. harry parks. she looks over at him but he's grabbing some cigars for his shirt pocket, then looks up at her with an innocent look that suggests he did not just say such a lovely thought.}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(trying to keep up with him)}
<D>__{yeah, okay, right...}
<A>__{they both grab their h}
<D>__{overnight bags and step out of the car.}
<C>__{arry}
<D>__{so, what are we gonna do out here, just the two of us, for two whole days?}
<A>__{marin sets her bag down, walks to harry, wraps her arms around his neck.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{tell me the truth, are you at all glad we waited?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm incredibly glad we're finally going to do it.}
<P>__{(she's a bit disappointed)}
<D>__{if that's the same as being glad we waited, then baby doll, i'm ecstatic.}
<A>__{marin smiles then kisses him. he's one of those guys that lets you kiss them.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(slaps her tush)}
<D>__{let's go for a swim, how long will it take you to change?}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{two minutes.}
<A>__{marin starts unbuttoning her sweater as she dances seductively toward the front door, then notices harry's cigars.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{oh har... no smoking in the house. my mom doesn't allow it.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{but she allows you to strip in the front yard and bring men you're dating here to...}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{she doesn't know everything i do...or when i do it.. or where i do it.}
<A>__{she slips off her sweater and drops it on harry's head.}
