<A>__{anderson stands on an embankment. he holds the precog disc in his hand, ready to throw it into the river. he stands like that ... and then slowly lets his hand drop. he doesn't do it.}
<L>__{interior anderson's home suburbs later}
<A>__{lisa enters the house, in a rush. every shade is drawn. paul anderson sits in an overstuffed chair, absolutely motionless, like a man who has died suddenly.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{don't move.}
<A>__{lisa doesn't get it. she continues toward him.}
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{stop! moving heats you up, makes it easier for them to pick you up on their thermals.}
<A>__{she looks at him, scared, stops in her tracks. she is suddenly suffocating.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{it's a hundred degrees in here.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{i turned the furnace all the way up. your hair dryer. the oven. if they come, it'll buy me twenty seconds. maybe thirty.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{nobody's coming for you.}
<A>__{anderson stares at her.}
<C>__{lisa }
<D>__{on the phone what you said. it's impossible.}
<A>__{she shakes her head in disbelief. anderson speaks, choking on the words.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{i'm going to kill ed witwer.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{it's not true.}
<A>__{anderson's right hand hangs over the side of his armchair. we see the bright disc cupped in the palm. he seems about to reveal it to her, but doesn't, yet. he keeps staring at her intently. something is holding him back.}
<C>__{lisa }
<D>__{you're upset. you've been unhappy. there's a lot of pressure on you. and then frank ...}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{one week from today. tuesday, june 25, at five twenty in the morning. i shoot him, lisa.}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you need to take time off.}
<A>__{anderson laughs harshly.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{you don't have to worry about that.}
<A>__{she steps toward him.}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{i want to hold you.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{if you love me, stand there. and don't move.}
<A>__{tears well in her eyes.}
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{i saw the disc, lisa. i shoot him. in the chest. and he dies. i've watched a thousand murders. this time i star in one.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{something's wrong. you wouldn't do it.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{the precogs are never wrong. they emit a single disc. "the immutable evidence of the infallible system."}
<A>__{the room is terribly hot, his words she begins to sway unsteadily. anderson focuses on her. her face. her hair ...}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{we'll figure this out. we'll review the system.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{there is no review. there's only the disc. it shows my guilt. there's no defense.}
<A>__{her long hair. he stares.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{you can't run. please, let's }
<A>__{a sound outside. they both turn. a deep silence. the furnace churns out heat. and anderson looks at lisa's hair ... and finally understands. slowly, and very carefully, anderson slides the disc back into his pocket. he rises from his chair. for the first time he goes to her, reaches out, and touches her hair.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{last week. it was strange. i watched from the bathroom window. you went out in the backyard to make a call.}
<A>__{she looks at him.}
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{an appointment, you said. for a haircut that afternoon.}
<A>__{lisa's hand jumps to her hair.}
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{you didn't get your hair cut. you went to the trouble of calling first thing in the morning. it was that important ...}
<A>__{she reaches for him. he pulls away.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{stop it! paul, please. you're panicking. everything's going to look wrong. you're going to distrust everybody and everything now.}
<A>__{lisa implores him.}
<C>__{lisa }
<D>__{you can't distrust me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it was ed i called.}
<A>__{anderson cocks his head.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{ed. why outside? why lie about it?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{stop being a cop and listen to me!}
<A>__{a booming, electronically altered voice suddenly penetrates the walls of the house from outside.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{director anderson! there is no escape!}
<A>__{anderson, betrayed, glares at his wife. she's frantic.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{your birthday's tomorrow! we wanted to...}
<A>__{but be's already on the move, running for the upstairs.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{drop to your hands and knees and stay there. precrime is entering your house!}
<A>__{lisa screams, as her front door is sonically blasted off its hinges, and a swarm of precrime officers in mirrored helmets hurtle in.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{paul!}
<A>__{they move past her and spread through the rooms and up the stairs like a disease in fast motion.}
<B>__{upstairs}
<A>__{helmeted officers hold their gloved right bands palm out, scanning rooms for thermal presence. an officer 1 steps out of a small room. he speaks, his voice electronically altered.}
<C>__{officer 1}
<D>__{he's got a hair dryer going. screwed up my reading.}
<A>__{the others nod.}
<C>__{officer 2}
<D>__{we're not picking up shit.}
<A>__{they rush into rooms, with increased urgency. we follow officer 1 as he moves counter to the group and down the stairs. he hesitates as he moves through the living room, which is awash in personnel. lisa stands against the wall, pale and shaken. he looks at her for a long beat, then steps over the shattered door and out into the sunlight.}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{everywhere else in the neighborhood it is green and calm. but anderson's house looks like a wasps's nest someone has kicked. four precrime hovercrafts are suspended above it, engines whining. black python transports are all over the street out in front, and more keep coming. and everywhere on foot, there are precrime police. officer i approaches a python ground transport. another officer guards it, weapon out, his head turning right to left. he settles on officer 1's approach and raises his weapon. officer 1 doesn't even break stride. he walks right up to the guard and then right through him. a holograph decoy. officer 1 enters the python.}
<B>__{inside the python}
<A>__{officer 1 removes his helmet it's anderson. and then comes the moment of truth have they cancelled his identiscan access to precrime vehicles yet? a little scanner arm arches down from the visor, and flashes a red beam into his eyes. anderson presses his lips together. the python turns on, and a generated voice greets him.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{paul anderson 0256 clear.}
<A>__{anderson grips the steering wheel. but his time, since it is a law enforcement. vehicle, the steering actually works. anderson pulls out. from above, as the python transport slips away from the chaos. then higher, and we see that the direction the python is headed will take it from the green of the suburbs, through the white of washington, and into the dark of the sprawl.}
