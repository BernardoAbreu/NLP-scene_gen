<D>__{we've had some terrible news. mr. lebowski is in seclusion in the west wing.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{huh.}
<A>__{brandt throws open a pair of heavy double doors. the music washes over us as we enter a great study where jeffrey lebowski, a blanket thrown over his knees, stares hauntedly into a fire, listening to lohengrin. brandt announces, ambiguously:}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{mr. lebowski.}
<A>__{jeffrey lebowski waves the dude in without looking around.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{it's funny. i can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome. i've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs. what. . . what makes a man, mr. lebowski?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{dude.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{i don't know, sir.}

<D>__{sure. that and a pair of testicles.}
<A>__{lebowski turns away from the dude with a haunted stare, lost in thought.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{you're joking. but perhaps you're right.}

<D>__{strong men also cry. . . strong men also cry.}
<A>__{he clears his throat.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{i received this fax this morning.}
<A>__{brandt hastily pulls a flimsy sheet from his clipboard and hands it to the dude.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{as you can see, it is a ransom note. sent by cowards. men who are unable to achieve on a level field of play. men who will not sign their names. weaklings. bums.}
