<L>__{exterior backyard day}
<A>__{we see quick cuts of debbie playing with the kids on the trampoline outside. she does a full flip and lands on her feet. pete is nowhere to be found.}

<D>__{what are you doing?}

<D>__{we're all downstairs waiting for you. you've been up here for a really long time now.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{oh, i'm almost done. i will be down in a second.}

<D>__{and you missed it.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{she'll do it again.}

<D>__{it's just that this is the fourth time you've gone to the bathroom today.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{give me a break.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{why is your instinct to escape?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{it's not my instinct to escape from you. it is my instinct to come into the bathroom when i need to go to the bathroom.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{how come i don't smell anything?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{it's because i shoved an altoid up my ass before i came in here.}

<D>__{what?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{let me see!}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{no, i'm not going to let you see.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{you're not going to let me see because you're not taking a poop.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i've been flushing as i go.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{you're flushing as you go? who takes a half hour to go to the bathroom?}
