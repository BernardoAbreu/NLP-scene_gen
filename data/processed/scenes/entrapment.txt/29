<L>__{exterior small channel day}
<A>__{the tiny jetski cruises in a quiet channel, crowded with vessels of all sizes, tugs, fishing boats, pleasure craft, junks, sampans, all larger than we are. gin clings close to mac, although it is no necessary. more like romantic. she is still flushed with the rush.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i guess you're gonna explain all this, huh?}
<A>__{but he says nothing. pulls out a water tight duffle. hands it back to her, without looking.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{dry clothes, you'll need them. in five minutes.}
<A>__{she takes the bag, confused.}
<C>__{gin}

<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i've seen you naked. give the boys a thrill.}
<A>__{he means it.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you probably won't be dating any of them, so what the hell.}
<A>__{gin looks around as they float through the maze of watercraft. no one seems to be paying much attention. what the hell. she unzips the bag, pulling out...}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{these...these are mine!}
<A>__{he never looks around.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{found 'em in your room. perhaps the thief wasn't your size.}
<A>__{she stares at the back of his head. wondering. he is stripping off his slickers. a neatly tailored suit beneath.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{we have a business appointment. in four minutes.}
<A>__{okay. she pulls her dress off over her head.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{business, huh?}
<A>__{she ignores some nearby whistles and shouts. begins drying herself with a fluffy towel from the bag.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{time has come to tell you. what business. i'm actually in.}
<A>__{uh oh. paydirt.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{uh. am i gonna like th...}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{i'm a thief.}
<A>__{she can scarcely believe he's admitting this.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{and now that i've told you. i will have to kill you.}
<A>__{he chuckles a scottish chuckle. cold and warm, at once.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{or...}
<A>__{she slips the dry dress over her head.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{...you can spend the most interesting three weeks of your life. training.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{training for wha...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{...followed by the most exciting night of your life. after which, you can walk away with 20 million untraceable dollars...}
<A>__{she blinks. he means this.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{...which will come in handy. things being what they are.}
<A>__{he shrugs.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{from now on. you can valet park.}
<A>__{she begins taking off her wet underwear, underneath the dress. we suspect unseen hordes crestfallen at her modesty.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{and if i refuse?}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{don't. please.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i mean, you won't really kill me, i'm far too adorable.}
<A>__{he looks around at her. as if deciding on that.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{last night, at fujitsu, i did some business. while you thought i was in the toilet.}
<A>__{jesus.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{what could you possibly steal in 18 min...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{thirty five super microchips. each worth one million dollars. and change.}
<A>__{staring dead at her eyes.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{you hate round num...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i stole your suitcase when i left you at the bar. i have since sent it on to the states, with three chips, well hidden.}
<A>__{are you following?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{since you aren't there to claim it, the bag will sit at customs. safe. unless...}
<A>__{no smile. no smile at all.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{they receive. an anonymous. tip.}
<A>__{holy. fucking. christ.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{that's entrapment.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{no, entrapment is what cops do to robbers.}
<A>__{we can feel her heart pounding from here.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{blackmail. is what robbers do to schmucks.}
<A>__{and leans. to kiss her mouth.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{even adorable ones.}
<A>__{they have glided up beside the gangway of a gigantic freighter. it is at water level, the steps they use for their tender. he points up to the name...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{pop quiz.}
<A>__{shikoku maru. she nods, slowly. pulls the ziploc bag from her purse. hands it over. he removes the sheets of paper. begins to peruse them...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{admit it's a rush. the best day of your heretofore drab life.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<A>__{he glances up.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{...accompanied by related foreplay.}
<A>__{and gives him the smile. what a gal. he offers his hand. she rises, hops lightly to the steps of the gangway in her bare feet. he pulls dry shoes from the duffle. and as she slips them on... ...he flips a switch, and the jetski begins to fill with water, mac stepping to the gangway beside her. they watch... ...the jetski rapidly sink out of sight. no evidence. a thorough guy.}
