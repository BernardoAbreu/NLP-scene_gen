<A>__{the hall is full. on the stage, dr. helen hudson is speaking. helen is a forensic psychologist. behind her is a projected diagram: predisposition, dissociation, trauma, fantasy, violent fantasy, facilitators, murder, and trauma reinforcement which she can point to with a laser pointing device. we see her from a considerable distance... the back of the balcony. her voice is crisp and assured.}

<D>__{our society creates these socially and psychically disenfranchised men, and their revenge on society is terrible. they are hard to catch. they are "the nice guy next door," their employers if they work at all find them quiet and uncomplaining. early abuse and rejection have taught them passivity. only in their violent fantasies do they feel alive. what they seek in their frenzied assaults on their victims is relief from passivity. for these men, ten minutes relief is worth far more than the life of another human being. torture, the pain they inflict, the screams of the victim, are all part of the ritual that gives them a brief respite from their own psychic pain. and then the depression, the forgetting, the feeling of sadness and despair begins the cycle all over again. like addicts seeking their drug, albert desalvo, bianchi and buono, berkowitz, dahmer, bundy they seek out their next victim.}
<A>__{during the second half of this speech, the eye of the camera has moved slowly forward until it settles just behind the balcony railing. closeup: helen}

<D>__{the cycle is endless until they are caught. and they are caught by chance they run a red light, and a body is in the trunk. a leaking pipe brings a plumber to a basement where they is the smell of death.}
<A>__{her eyes have come to rest on the spot of the camera eye in the balcony... her voice chokes off. she stares. helen's pov: sitting in the front row of the balcony, a young red headed man (daryll lee cullum) leans forward, resting his tattooed arms on the railing. he smiles intimately at helen. helen cuts her eyes to the left. she sees: backstage, an overweight cop in plain clothes. instantly alert to helen's alarm, he jumps up, comes within an inch of exposing his presence to the audience. a second cop, in the wings on the other side of the stage, also springs to attention. first cop's eyes follow helen's... their pov: the balcony young red headed man is no longer there. helen can she believe her eyes? resumes:}

<D>__{at any time, right now, as you listen, the fbi estimates there are 30 to 35 serial killers stalking their victims. the serial killer is a plaque that must be addressed not only by the law, but by science. florida spent eight million dollars to execute ted bundy. it would have been better spent building a forensic penal facility devoted to research.}
<A>__{once again her eyes fix on the balcony to reassure herself that the smiling man is not there...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{confined for life, without parole, and subjected to scientific study, these men's lives might finally, in some small measure, educate and thereby protect society. thank you.}
<A>__{applause as helen warily checks for the two cops. they are carefully casing the crowd.}
