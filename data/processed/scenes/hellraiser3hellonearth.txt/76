<A>__{joey is driving again. and this time she's not even stopping at red lights. she steams across junctions, leaving cars swerving and horns honking in her wake. something catches her eye and she throws a glance to her side.}

<P>__{(appalled)}
<D>__{oh god ...}
<A>__{joey's (moving) pov up a side street, atop a hill, is the inner city church. it's on fire. joey swings the car up the hill. smash cut to: joey getting out of the car nearer the burning church. off to her side is a smaller building, the church hall. joey shakes her head at the desecration. she has no doubt who's responsible.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{having fun en route, you bastard.}
<A>__{suddenly, a creaking noise from behind her. joey freezes in terror then slowly very slowly turns round. joey's pov shock reveal the priest now mercifully dead is crucified against the side wall of the smaller building. pinhead's nails protrude from his palms and his ankles.}
