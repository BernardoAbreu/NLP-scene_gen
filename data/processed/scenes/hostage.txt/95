<A>__{dennis is freaking. he believes that the sheriffs are about to crash through the doors }
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{shit!!!!}
<A>__{now talley throttles back; he senses that dennis is at the breaking point and wants to coax him back from the edge }
<C>__{talley}
<P>__{(calmer; coaxing)}
<D>__{talk to me, dennis. help me help you. why can't you put smith on the phone?}
<A>__{dennis finally makes the admission }
<C>__{dennis}
<P>__{(quietly)}

<D>__{you've already helped yourself once, dennis; be smart again. if you save his life, it'll help when you get to court.}
<A>__{dennis is at the edge; he's looking straight down into his deepest fears. he finally relents }
