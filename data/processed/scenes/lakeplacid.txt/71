<L>__{exterior campsite seconds later}
<A>__{hank hangs still, upside down, from the tree, as hector, kelly, and jack approach.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i probably could've accomplished freeing him myself but he had a look of mayhem on his upside down face.}
<A>__{they arrive. hank says nothing, he hangs there perfectly still.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{hank?}
<C>__{keough}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{the three exchange looks.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{keough}
<P>__{(calmly; almost sweet)}
<D>__{other than feeling slightly embarrassed, i'm perfectly fine.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{could you cut me down?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{promise you won't kill me, first.}
<C>__{keough}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{i have no interest in ever looking at you, hector.}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{could you please cut me down?}
<A>__{jack gives kelly a knife.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you cut, we'll hold him.}
<A>__{hector and jack grab hold, kelly cuts, they lower him to the ground. he rises.}
<C>__{keough}
<P>__{(calm)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i lied.}
<A>__{and he charges after hector, who runs toward the beach. keough chases, jack and kelly pursue, trying to stop him. and suddenly, exploding out of the woods, a ferocious charging growl. an attack. screams all over, a half second of confusion before we see it's a large black bear jumping out of the darkness, right at hector. hector dives out of its path. screams, panic, shouting, as the bear rears up on his hind legs. seemingly about to lunge when... exploding out of the water the giant jaws of a crocodile. in a flash instant, the beast engulfs the bear, twisting it, slamming it on the ground and then pulling it into the water. the bear fights back ferociously for a second but there can only be one outcome here. in a matter of seconds, both bear and crocodile have vanished. and the water is calm again.}
<B>__{angle the faces}
<A>__{utter catatonia. shock. whatever they expected to find in this expedition, they weren't remote prepared for that. there are no words here. shock is pre empting every other human sensory. what they just saw... a crocodile head measuring five feet rise up out of the water and gobbled a fucking bear. a beat. then }
<C>__{keough}
<P>__{(admitting)}
<D>__{okay. it's a crocodile. i will admit it.}
<A>__{a beat as they gulp air.}
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{you're cut.}
<A>__{there is a little blood over jack's right eye. he dabs it.}
<C>__{kelly }
<P>__{(to hector)}
<D>__{he was an indo pacific.}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(daunted)}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{scales were oval. it was an asian crocodile.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{asia? how... how could he get here?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{obviously some asshole in hong kong flushed him down a toilet.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{he had to be thirty feet long.}
<A>__{another beat.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(charged)}
<D>__{hank. the little cannon you brought, get it. guard the shoreline. otherwise, we're done. we made the i.d., our job is finished.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{alright, ms. paleontologist. i wanna know why that monster is here. you got a theory?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{why he's that big, i don't know. why he's here... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving. australia, fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{but why maine and why alone? crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{maybe he doesn't play well with others.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{is everything a big fucking joke to you?}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(re his groin)}
<D>__{bite my bishop.}
<A>__{and keough starts for him, but jack intercedes.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{i'm sick of him!}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(interceding)}
<D>__{c'mon.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{let him go! i'm sick of you too, let him go.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{thing about being rich, sheriff, my parents had the added luxury of being able to ditch me off at karate school, i'm a brown belt. so go ahead. take your best shot.}
<A>__{keough throws a haymaker, decking hector. lays him out.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{hank!}
<C>__{keough}
<P>__{(who knew?)}
<D>__{he said he knew karate!}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(shaken)}
<D>__{at school they'd always say "go" first.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to keough)}
<D>__{get your big gun and guard the shore. hector. go to your tent.}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(muttering as he goes)}
<D>__{he never said "go".}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to keough)}
<D>__{get the gun.}
<C>__{keough}
<P>__{(muttering as he goes)}
<D>__{if i fall into a hole or get hoisted into a tree...}
<A>__{and he's gone.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(re keough and hector)}
<D>__{like little children.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{yeah. i got some stuff for your cut.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i wonder if he's some kind of mutant.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{that bear had to be surprised.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(taking her arm; ushering)}
<D>__{let's get away from the shore.}
<A>__{she looks at his hand on her arm, which suddenly makes him self consious.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<A>__{they hold a look.}
