<A>__{the door opens. she's dressed for bed. i don't hesitate, afraid she'll shun me. move to her, she doesn't startle. an arm around her waist, drawing her in, my mouth close to hers. i take her face in my hand, check her eyes, a beat before they tell me it's okay...i lean in, takes a lifetime...and kiss her soft until she kisses back, her mouth moving over my split lips, she puts her hands on my face, pulling me in. she feels exactly like i imagined. my coat comes off. her camisole follows. we're moving toward a bed in back. i stop, pull back, the moonlight moves over her shoulders. i whisper:}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{...tell me if i'm being too rough.}
<A>__{tears squeezed through smiling eyes, she kisses me even harder, pulls me down to her. we make love like we've never touched another. everything blurs, burns down: bradley. wilhite. tommy. hector junior. ainge. she takes it all away. i escape into her. hours fall. i could stay here forever...}
