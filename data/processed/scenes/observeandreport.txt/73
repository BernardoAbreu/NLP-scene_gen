<L>__{interior mall day}
<A>__{ronnie and charles stand in the middle of the floor and supervise the "mall walkers."}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{be careful, guys. nice and slow.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{that's not bad, but you need to learn to speak in a more authoritative voice. watch this. slow it down! slow it down! you've already received one verbal, don't make me issue a second!}
<P>__{(back to charles)}
<D>__{see, you can't be intimidated. you have to make them respect you.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{ronnie, you know i really want to thank you for the job. you're a man of your word.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{no problem, my young student. so, i got something to tell you. keep this between us until it's official, but i don't think i'm going to be here for much longer.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{you're quitting? but you love this job.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i do love it, but it looks like someone is going to be joining the police force.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{the real police?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{they're calling me up. it's basically a done deal. just a little red tape is the only thing keeping me from carrying a gun.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{i didn't even know you wanted to become a cop.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{it's always been my job. the mall thing is great training, but it has its limitations. some stars are just meant to shine brighter than others.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{congrats, brother.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(to a mall walker)}
<D>__{hey, slow it down, lady!}
<A>__{a mall walker slows her pace. she turns around and ronnie sees that it's nell.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{nell?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{hey, ronnie.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{nothing, just getting in shape.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{well, that's okay, i guess. just watch your speed, okay?}
<A>__{nell waves and walks on.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{isn't that your girlfriend?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{ex.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{she looked good.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you think so?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{she looks a lot better.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{ronnie shrugs it off.}
