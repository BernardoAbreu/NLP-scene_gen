<A>__{mickey is seen leaving the hospital. he strides slowly, his shoulders slouched, his hands in his pockets. his voice is heard over the screen as he crosses the street, continuing his self absorbed walk on the opposite side. occasional traffic goes by.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{okay...take it easy. he didn't say you had anything. he just doesn't like the spot on your x ray, that's all. it doesn't mean you have anything. don't jump to conclusions.}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{nothing's gonna happen to you. you're in the middle of new york city. this is your town. you're surrounded by people and traffic and restaurants.}
<A>__{mickey brushes against a heavyset man who gives him a nasty look. mickey is so dazed, he doesn't even notice.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{i mean, god, how can you, how can you just one day...vanish? keep calm. you're gonna be okay. don't panic.}
