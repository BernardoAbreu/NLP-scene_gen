<L>__{exterior windmill inn day}
<A>__{miles pulls up and parks.}
<L>__{interior motel room day}
<A>__{as miles enters, a shirtless jack drops the barely legal and is immediately upon him, grabbing him in a big bearhug. the tv is on, perhaps showing an e! true hollywood story.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yo! yo! here's my boy! here's my boy! who's your daddy, boy? who is yo' daddy?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{put me down, jack.}
<A>__{jack continues his paean to miles's triumphant night.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i said put me down. jack!}
<A>__{still gripping miles in a bearhug, jack flings the both of them onto the bed. now on top of miles, jack kisses both cheeks.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm so proud of you! let me love you!}
<A>__{now they get up off the bed.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{so tell me everything. details. i like details.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{it's private.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're kidding, right? tell me what happened, you fucker, or i will tie your dick in a knot.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{let's leave it alone.}
<A>__{jack looks at miles, his face frozen with incomprehension.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you didn't get any, did you?}
<P>__{(off miles's silence)}
<D>__{you're a homo.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{just stop, okay? make something up, and that's what happened. whatever you want. write my confession, and i will sign it. just stop pushing me all the time! i can't take it! you're an infant! this is all a big party for you, but not for me! this is serious. and you just... leave me alone, okay? you're fucking me up.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{wow. okay. calm down. sorry.}
<A>__{miles begins to calm down. jack grows concerned and sensitively puts one arm around his friend.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{did you have trouble performing? yeah, that's...}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{shut up! shut up, jack!}
<A>__{the phone rings and both men look at it, silenced by the ominous sound.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{don't answer it.}
<A>__{but jack is drawn to it as though enticed by a strange game of russian roulette.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i'm telling you, don't.}
<A>__{jack picks up the receiver and puts it to his ear.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hello? oh, hey, honey. how you doing? uh huh. uh huh.}
<P>__{(mouthing)}
<D>__{christine.}
<A>__{miles lies on his bed and clamps both hands over his ears. his face is dark with resentment.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{listen, honey. let me call you back. miles and i are in the middle of something. no, it's nothing serious miles is just having one of his freak outs. yeah. love you too. i will call you right back.}
<A>__{jack hangs up.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{this whole week has gone sour. it isn't turning out like it was supposed to.}
<P>__{(deadly serious)}
<D>__{i want to go home.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{who's being selfish now? i'm the one getting married. i thought this week was supposed to be about me.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{we gotta slow down.}
<P>__{(closing his eyes)}
<D>__{i'm so tired. let's just get out of here.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i know what you need.}
