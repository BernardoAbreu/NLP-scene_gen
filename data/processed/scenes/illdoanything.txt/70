<L>__{interior matt's hallway evening}
<A>__{cathy stands there overhearing the voices from inside.}
<C>__{jeannie's voice}
<D>__{but why can't i stay just a little while?}
<C>__{matt's voice}
<D>__{because this is a very special friend of daddy's and i need privacy... be fair... i let you wear that dress.}
<A>__{cathy knocks. matt opens the door.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{he steps aside so cathy may enter... the place is tidied up. he has changed his clothes and jeannie is wearing a lace dress, fit for a young princess, complete with flowered tiara and ballet slippers, with trailing blue ribbons at the heels and a velvet cape.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{this is my daughter, queen elizabeth. jeannie, this is cathy.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{hi... what a pretty dress.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{thank you. that's nice.}
<B>__{on matt}
<A>__{happy that jeannie is behaving so well.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{are you going to a party?}
<C>__{jeannie}
<P>__{(wildly hopeful)}
<D>__{am i going to a party, dad?}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{no. you're going next door.}
<A>__{jeannie is crest fallen; for a horrible second, it looks as if she may start to wail... matt moves into action with a pep talk.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{remember our compromise? you're going next door to lucy's to play and you'll show the kids your dress and i will come get you later and we'll go out someplace and i will buy you anything you want for under seventeen dollars?}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{i remember.}
<A>__{she starts for the door, doubles back, and kisses a surprised cathy full on the lips... the gesture is beautifully, even movingly carried off. it is totally false.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<P>__{(again to cathy)}
<D>__{goodbye. i love you...}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(totally thrown)}
<D>__{well,... thank you.}
<A>__{jeannie is on the run... as she passes her father.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{jeannie nods acknowledgment as she flies past.}
<B>__{other angle}
<A>__{favoring cathy, matt leans out the doorway until jeannie is safely next door, then re enters.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{what a little winner, huh?}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(modestly)}
<D>__{oh...?}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(waving script)}
<D>__{this is my favorite project. and it looks like we're going ahead with it.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(overlap)}
<D>__{'mr. deeds goes to town?' oh, it's a remake...}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{well, come on, what's original? and this is a wonderful rewrite. it's funnier.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{and there's a part in it for...}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{yes... burke says i can test whoever i want. he wasn't even surprised when i mentioned you. so, if you could read this rewrite now and if you like it, we can make a test deal...}
<P>__{(catching herself)}
<D>__{they can make a test deal... we can tell them that they can make a test deal.}
<P>__{(in explanation)}
<D>__{i think it's important for me to steer clear of the business end.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{okay... which part?}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{longfellow deeds.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{mr. deeds?}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{who goes to town, yes.}
<A>__{matt takes this in... takes this miracle in.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{who are we kidding? i'm even having trouble getting short parts i'm going to say i love it no matter what you've done to it.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{stop being so creepy honest. i really have an instinct about you for this. i'm going home call me when you finish reading it.}
<P>__{(how quickly status changes things)}
<D>__{or... come on over.}
