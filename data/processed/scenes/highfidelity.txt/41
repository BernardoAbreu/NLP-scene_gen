<A>__{rob is going through a huge stack of used cd's, sorting them off into different bins, bouncing his head absently to the music the same song of marie's that rob had on when laura called last night.}

<C>__{liz}
<D>__{how're you holding up?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{actually, i'm fine. i'm great. last night i got to thinking, "you know what? maybe it is time to move on. maybe we're just not right for each other. or maybe we are. but time will tell and at this point i'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." you know?}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{yeah. like i said, i don't want to take sides. and i like laura with you. she's more fun, more open. you guys are good together. i just wish you two could, i don't know. i don't think much of this ian guy }

<C>__{dick}
<D>__{marie lasalle is in the store! here, she's here, and now!}
<A>__{rob freezes, he and dick turn to the speaker, which cranks marie's voice. rob goes to the phone and picks up the handset.}

<D>__{hey, liz, i gotta go... tomorrow night? great. green mill. fine. seven? done. thanks. right. bye.}
<A>__{he hangs up fast, spins around to look in a cracked one foot square cracked mirror bearing the logo of aerosmith that is mounted on the wall, and moves out into the}
<B>__{front room}
<A>__{and up the aisle fast toward the stereo where he turns marie's music off. he takes a deep breath and looks up, meeting her eyes.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{oh. hi.}
<A>__{marie smiles.}
<C>__{marie}
<P>__{(re: music)}
<D>__{don't you like that?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{no, no, i love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... well.}
<A>__{he reaches back and puts it back on. he cracks his face into a smile, then walks fast back to the stock room door. marie watches him go.}
<B>__{stock room}
<A>__{where as soon as he crosses the threshold his fist clench and he grimaces:}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{what fucking ian guy?!!}

<C>__{dick}
<D>__{rob !}
<C>__{rob}

<C>__{rob}
<D>__{that's fucking great, barry. we can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each. fantastic, barry!}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{we can take your car.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{it's not my car, now is it? it's laura's car, and thus laura has it. so it's an ass bumping double transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. wow. fucking great.}
<A>__{barry sighs, throws up his hands and heads out the door.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{jaggoff...}
<A>__{barry exits. rob seems to be having trouble staying on his feet.}
