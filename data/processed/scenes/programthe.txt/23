<L>__{exterior two lane highway night}
<A>__{the crowd from the 911 (bud, alvin, lattimer, darnell, bobby and louanne) follow joe down the hill behind the bar toward a busy two lane highway. joe, a little drunker than the others, starts howling at the moon like a timber wolf. the others join in.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{what are we doin', joe?}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(slightly slurred)}
<D>__{there's something i wanta try. gotta wake up our mojo. start settin' the tone for the season.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{this is not a good time to be settin' anything. you're in no shape...}
<A>__{suddenly joe makes a dash out onto the highway.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{joe, c'mon joe, don't be an asshole. joe! god damnit, why's he always doin' shit like this? coach'll fuckin' kill me. alvin, go get him, will ya?}
<C>__{alvin}
<D>__{hell no, you go get his ass. crazy motherfucker.}
<A>__{joe stands on the white line, cars and trucks whizzing by, then lies down on his back, arms at his side. joe's point of view cars and trucks blast toward us, roar on by, right on top of us, honking, spraying grime, shaking the asphalt. bud and the others on the side of the road are increasingly worried now.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{fuck this shit.}
<A>__{pissed off, bud sprints out to the white line. the draft wake of a passing truck almost blows him over.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{c'mon, joe, that's enough. let's get the hell outa here. what if somebody drifts or crosses the line to pass?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what's the matter, bud? can't you follow?}
<A>__{bud hesitates a second, scared, but stung by this dare.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(torn)}
<D>__{god damnit, god damnit. shit.}
<A>__{bud can't fight it. he lies down on the line, his head touching joe's feet. joe begins to howl again. bud joins in. alvin and the others can't believe it.}
<C>__{alvin}
<D>__{startin' to look like a loaf of wonder bread out there.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{they're makin' us look like pussies, ya know. standin' here suckin' our thumbs.}
<C>__{lattimer}
<P>__{(to alvin)}
<D>__{yeh, and there's nobody from the defense out there.}
<A>__{bobby and lattimer look at each other a beat. time to ante up. both turn to alvin.}
<C>__{alvin}
<D>__{what are you lookin' at? you think you're bad?}
<A>__{alvin snorts in disgust and starts out onto the blacktop. bobby and lattimer smile, go to follow. louanne grabs bobby, holds him back.}
<C>__{louanne}
<P>__{(vaguely sexual)}
<D>__{bobby, be careful, o.k? please, be careful.}
<A>__{bobby smiles, grabs her ass, pulls her to him, gives her a long, passionate kiss, then sprints out to the white line, leaving her breathless. alvin, bobby and lattimer lie down in front of bud. now there's a line of five, a human highway median. everybody scared shitless, howling their lungs out. louanne and darnell watch from the side of the road.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{this guy do this kinda shit a lot? they never mentioned this in recruiting.}
<A>__{finally, joe laughing wildly, jumps up and they all scramble back to safety. out of breath, but pumped up, they exchange exhilarated high fives. alvin just shakes his head.}
