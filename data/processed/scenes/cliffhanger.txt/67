<L>__{exterior mountain top douglas tourist shack day}
<A>__{travers, qualen and the rest of the expedition head out of the shack, a little groggy. odds are no one got much sleep. travers shoves hal toward a sketchy "you are here" map of the mountain range, and hands him the tracer monitor.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{still interested in staying alive?}
<A>__{hal matches the monitor to the map the blip is higher up.}
<C>__{hal}
<P>__{(pointing to map)}
<D>__{it's up here. somewhere on the tower. there's a way to cross over to the top in about half a day.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{show me.}
<A>__{travers shoves hal forward the others follow. elsewhere on the mountain summit binocular pov from about fifty yards off, someone watches hal lead the gang away from the shack.}
<C>__{brett }
<D>__{they're heading toward the opposite edge. an easy way down.}
<B>__{brett and evan}
<A>__{are crouched in the woods. brett, gun in hand, has no idea how far out of his league he is. evan looks like he's having second thoughts, but he can't hack down now.}
<C>__{brett}
<D>__{i will cut around this side, and wind up in front. you come up behind them quietly. and we've got 'em.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{brett they've got five guns }
<C>__{brett}
<D>__{and you can collect them all after i get the drop on 'em. let's get moving.}
<A>__{brett, automatic held high, circles off through the woods. evan reluctantly lopes off toward his assignment. below gabe's cave gabe pulls his jacket on reversed, with the grey lining out, so the orange won't make him so easy to spot and starts out towards the facing tower his route, clearly, is going to be along the rock wall. it's relatively sheer, but there are shelves cut into it to make walking easy. mountain top summit brett races quietly through the woods in a parallel path with hal, who's guiding the hang. brett circles around ahead of them, waiting. before he can jump out hal's pov on brett hiding ahead in the trees and rocks.}
<B>__{hal}
<A>__{makes eye contact with brett, realizes what he's doing, and shakes his head as violently as he dares no, don't }
<B>__{brett}
<A>__{gives hal a confident wink in response, then pounces in front of the gang, gun held high.}
<C>__{brett}
<D>__{end of the line!}
<A>__{travers, delmer, kristel and kynette are startled, but don't immediately comply. this throws brett off his stride.}
<C>__{brett}
<P>__{(nervous now)}
<D>__{you heard me! drop the guns!}
<A>__{travers smiles and steps closer to brett. the others walk up in front of hal. travers actually laughs.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{"end of the line"? that's classic.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you've got style. so, i'm going to give you a three count to figure out how to turn the safety off.}
<A>__{brett doesn't even look down he responds by firing a short burst over travers' head.}
<C>__{brett}
<D>__{nice try. i've got one of these at home. now drop 'em.}
<A>__{all drop their guns brett, unfortunately, realizes at the same time we do }
<C>__{brett}
<D>__{hey where's the other guy }
<C>__{hal}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{brett, behind you!}
<A>__{too late brett can only twist around half way before }
<B>__{qualen}
<A>__{easily mows down brett with his machine gun, riddling him with at least thirty rounds at close range. brett falls dead into the snow. qualen walks up to brett's corpse, blood steaming in the reddening snow, and kicks it over.}
<B>__{below on the wallside}
<A>__{gabe, reacting to the sound of the machine gun fire, climbs up, but there's nothing he can do }
<B>__{travers and qualen}
<A>__{and the others pick up their guns.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(turning to face hal)}
<D>__{time to }
<A>__{travers sees that hal is gone he's escaped in the confusion. in the woods hal runs like his ass is on fire and practically collides with evan, who is more panicked than ever.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{what are we going to do }
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{you came up here to jump the spur }
<P>__{(pulls evan's chute out of his pack)}
<D>__{this'd be a great time to do it.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(panicked)}
<D>__{but }
<C>__{hal}
<P>__{(quick)}
<D>__{listen they don't know you're up here i will draw their fire, you've got to make the jump and get help.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i don't i uh }
<C>__{hal}
<P>__{(exasperated, grabs chute)}
<D>__{unless you want to do it the other way around?}
<A>__{evan snatches the parachute and runs off. hal, wasting no time, runs in the opposite direction, deliberately making as much noise as he can, slapping branches, stomping on rocks.}
