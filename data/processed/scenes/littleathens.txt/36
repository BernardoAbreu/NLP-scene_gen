<A>__{allison is seated on a small wooden bench in the yard in front of the rescue squad. heather is pacing back and forth in front of her, cell phone to her ear. both are smoking cigarettes. heather is still heated from seeing steve's girl, and allison is uncomfortable being around heather, who may lash out at anything. we cut back and forth between derek and heather.}
