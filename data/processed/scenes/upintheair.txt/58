<A>__{ryan is packing his roll away bag. it is practiced and systematic. he's just about finished, when he notices the cut out of his sister's engagement photo. he tries placing it in the open bag, but it is immediately clear that the photo is two inches to long. he tries putting it on an angle, but that doesn't help.}

<D>__{huh.}
<A>__{ryan centers the cut out again and tries to zip around it, but he can't get the zipper around the heads of the photo. for a moment, it almost seems like he's assaulting their tiny head with the zipper handle. doesn't help. a moment of silent frustration.}
