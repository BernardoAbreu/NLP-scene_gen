<A>__{train exterior night indian. steam. a breed of its own. third class coach interior night gandhi sits by a window in the dimly lit coach. ba sleeps on the seat next to him, another member of the party next to her. gandhi's solemn eyes are studying the huddled humanity in the rocking coach. people are sleeping everywhere, some half erect on the benches, many on the floor among the bundles and trunks and bedrolls and baskets. some have children, some are very old. one old man, sleepless like gandhi, stares back at him across the shadowed squalor of the coach; somewhere unseen a crying baby is soothed by his mother. gandhi looks at the bench across from him. charlie andrews, his tall frame cramped in a tiny space between the window looks at gandhi dozily, a little smile of sufferance, then he closes his eyes again, leaning his head against the rocking window frame. narrow street a small town exterior day gandhi is carried along in a ceremonial chair borne on the shoulders of some trotting men. the chair is swathed in flowers, and flowers are being showered on gandhi by the running children and the crowd lining the narrow street. ba and charlie and two others are following in a flower bedecked ox cart, lost in the mass of people that are swirling around gandhi. on a building top a british officer watches emotionlessly as gandhi and the crowd pass below him. on this building and others we see some on his indian soldiers watching with their rifles beside them. indian villages exterior day as from a train... but the shots are varied; some close of farmers and water buffalo, and ragged children and women in colorful saris carrying pots on their heads, and some distant of villages as units, one and another and another.}
