<A>__{a figure moves stealthily from the shadows and approached lenny's car: iris, hair dyed black now, wearing jeans and a coat but still showing scars from last night's pursuit. she tries the door of the car: locked. she looks toward the coral lounge, debates whether to go look for lenny. better not. she takes a squid tape from her pocket, and scribbles a note on the label: "help me. iris." she drops the tape through a 2 inch gap in lenny's sun roof... and it bounces off the seat, onto the floor. she looks through the windshield, totally distraught, trying to see where the tape landed... and sees the reflection of cop cruiser lights coming down the street. she crouches next to the bmw, trying to blot herself out. and when the cruiser passes, she slumps to the ground, crying, afraid to move.}
