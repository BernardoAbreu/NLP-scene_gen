<A>__{the music they are dancing to is being played by solomon, having cut directly from the tune he was previously playing. he plays with a light determination, and in no way seems possessed with empty servitude. solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal thanks and congratulations from all. it should be clear that despite their respective races there is much admiration and appreciation for solomon's abilities.}

<A>__{it is a saturday morning. clad in her finest attire is anne; solomon's wife, a few years younger than he. we see also the northup children: margaret who is eight, and alonzo who is five. they are handsome, and well groomed kids. anne straightens up the children. she finishes, she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if preparing to pose for a portrait. they all wait a moment, then solomon enters the foyer. he stands and looks admiringly at his family. admiringly stressed. it isn't that he doesn't have love for them, he does as well. but in the moment, he truly admires his greatest accomplishment: a family that is healthy and well and provided for. he goes to his children, and hands each a coin, then goes to anne. gives her a kiss on the cheek. the children giggle at the sight.}
<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{solomon and his family are out walking along the streets and groves of saratoga. the streets are well populated this morning with many people out strolling. most are white, but there are blacks as well. they are freed blacks who mingle fairly easily though not always completely with the whites. we see, too, a few black slaves who travel with their white masters. these pairings are largely from the south and despite the fact the blacks are slaves they are not physically downtrodden, not field hands. they are well dressed and "leading apparently an easy life" comparatively speaking as they trail their masters. as they walk, solomon and his family arrive to an intersection well worn and muddied from horse and cart traffic. solomon and his children easily jump across the muck. anne stands at the lip of the puddle, calls for solomon to help her across.}

<A>__{after the show, the pub now fairly empty, solomon, hamilton and brown sit down to eat. hamilton and brown drink, but again solomon abstains. though solomon remains cool, hamilton and brown put up a great show of being disappointed as hamilton counts out what little money was collected.}

<D>__{not an additional tip from a one of them. they expect to be entertained for nothing.}
