<L>__{interior technology room day}
<A>__{anthony has dragged himself to a sitting position against the bottom of one of the windmills. he winces as he prods his tender ankle with the end of his staff. it sparks. the large canvas arms of the windmill rotate above his head. the wind blows through his hair.}
<B>__{whoosh...whoosh...}
<A>__{feels good. anthony reaches up and waves his hand of his "eyes."}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{now the seer can only see what god wants him to. forty years on a planet of monks and i've finally found religion.}
<A>__{a floor board creaks. anthony strains to hear:}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{john? ripley?}
<B>__{whoosh...whoosh...}
<A>__{he knows it is not.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{well come then. i haven't got forever.}
<A>__{a shadow falls across his face. he can feel it. he doesn't have to see what is here. the underground ocean day into night the leather boat makes its way across the sea. john rows while ripley holds the torch aloft. as night falls she takes the oars. the ocean is dead calm. the coracle glides across the glass like surface. john flexes his scarred fingers.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{your hands okay?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{they'll be fine. you've been on a boat before.}
<A>__{ripley squints ahead of them. the ocean seems to go on forever.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i was a warrant officer on a ship but i did all my sailing in space.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{father anselm used to take me on his coracle when i was little.}
<A>__{ripley leans forward scans his face.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{how old were you when they towed this satellite out here?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{five. the abbot said they put us to sleep for the thirty years it took to get here. we've had almost forty more. until now.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what happened to your mother?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{never had one. i mean, never knew her. i mean, i did, once. she left my father when he joined the movement. if she hadn't i wouldn't be here. they kept the other children with the women, on earth. that was too long ago now. like a dream.}
<A>__{ripley's face grows strangely dark. she turns to the water.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{did you know that i was a mother?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{the girl in the ship with ?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{no. on earth. i never mentioned my daughter. my daughter. i have had i guess, by now a daughter on earth. kathy. she was nine when i signed on to the nostromo. mommy will be home before you know it i said. my shares would have set us up good. then i lost sixty years floating around in a rescue pod. thanks to the alien. i came home to face a bitter, 70 year old woman. my daughter. a little girl who's mother never came home.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{jesus christ.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{they said i should have been happy to be alive. funny, huh? that's why i went back the second time. not so i could fight it you can't fight it so i could let it kill me.}
<A>__{she rubs her chest }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you didn't choose to get lost in space.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{thanks for the try father }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{brother.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{brother, but i'm not looking for absolution. i couldn't be a good mother to my daughter. i couldn't be a good mother to newt. but i can be a good mother to you. i can make sure you survive.}
<A>__{suddenly they feel rain ripley holds out her hand. her eyes open wide at what she sees. john takes the oars as she holds the torch over the side: the ocean has become red with blood. blood drips down from the ceiling around them.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{blood.}
<A>__{john looks up.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{from the levels above.}
<A>__{his face goes white.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{he must have slaughtered all }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{don't think about it. don't think about what's up there. just row.}
<A>__{as ripley takes the torch away from the water, tiny ripples move across the surface. she doesn't notice.}
<B>__{a shape}
<A>__{passes underneath the boat. a swimming creature. the alien. thanks to the reflective qualities of water, it appears huge. dwarfs their coracle.}
