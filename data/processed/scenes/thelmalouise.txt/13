<L>__{interior thelma's bedroom day}
<A>__{thelma is still throwing stuff in, randomly now. she talks to herself quietly the whole time. she is taking stuff off of her nightstand, a small clock, fingernail scissors, etc. she opens the drawer of her nightstand. her attitude is purposeful; she looks as if she knows exactly what she's doing; although, frankly, she has no idea, and each decision is completely arbitrary. as she rifles through it, plucking various items from among the jumbled contents, we see there is a gun in there, one darryl bought her for protection. it is unloaded, but there is a box of bullets. she picks up the gun like it's a rat by the tail and puts it in her purse.}

<A>__{she grabs the box of bullets and throws them in, too. she tries to close her suitcase, but there is stuff hanging out all over the place. she stuffs things back in the sides and heaves all her weight against the top.}
