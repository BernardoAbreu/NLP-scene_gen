<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you rigged the illusion to fail, right?}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you paid off the doctor. you set up the fake body. yes?}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{and then... because i was getting too close to something }
<P>__{(at dorothea)}
<D>__{ or someone, you called swann}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{i tried to pay you off.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{was that swann's idea?}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{no. it was mine. i didn't want any more bloodshed. that's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for nix to come after.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?}
<A>__{on harry. he looks as though he's beginning to think maybe nix's resurrection is plausible.}
<C>__{harry}

<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{why don't you leave this alone? let everybody think it's over?}

<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{nix was never interested in you. it was always swann.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(to dorothea)}
<D>__{maybe valentin's right. we should let it alone.}
<A>__{a bell starts to toll }
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(con't.)}
<D>__{he went to all that trouble to be dead. maybe we should let him stay that way.}
