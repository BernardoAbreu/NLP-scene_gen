<D>__{the horsie story, please.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{ah well.}
<A>__{called upon to perform, the stutter returns slightly. but the two girls listen raptly, ignoring their father's minor impediment, and it fades.}

<D>__{once upon a time there were two horsies. a white horse that went clip clop clip clop through hyde park. and a black horse that went clip clop clip clop through hyde park. they met in the middle of hyde park. the white horse said "neigh". the black horse said, "neigh". the white horse continued on, clip clop clip clop through hyde park. the black horse continued on, clip clop clip clop through hyde park. and that's the end of the story. now off to bed.}
