<L>__{interior nell's room night}
<A>__{nell finishes putting things away in drawers. theo watches, leaning in the doorway. nell looks around at the room: and this is her new family's new home. theo smiles sweetly at her, comes over. an awkward moment, as the seriousness drains away.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{ever try putting your hair up in a french twist?}
<A>__{theo reaches for nell's hair. nell pulls away. theo pauses. nell realizes she shouldn't have pulled back.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{sorry. i'm not used to being touched.}
<A>__{she moves closer to let theo examine her hair. theo takes nell's hair, holds it up in a french twist.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{you've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{yes. i've missed it.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{no. the world has missed you.}
<A>__{cautiously, nell peers in a mirror at herself... and likes what she sees. theo lets nell's hair drop. theo moves for the door.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{good night, theo.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{you, too. happy tossing and turning.}
