<A>__{ pentagon and alcatraz as necessary.}
<C>__{hummel}
<D>__{i will come straight to the point, general kramer: eighty three force reconnaissance marines have died under my various commands. forty seven in northern laos and southern china ...}
<C>__{hayden sinclair}
<D>__{southern china? we never admitted we sent troops into china.}
<A>__{there is a pause.}
<C>__{hummel}
<D>__{who is that. identify yourself.}
<A>__{everyone stares at sinclair.}
<C>__{hayden sinclair}
<D>__{white house chief of staff sinclair, general.}
<C>__{hummel}
<D>__{how old are you, white house chief of staff sinclair.}
<C>__{rayden sinclair}
<D>__{i'm thirty three.}
<C>__{hummel}
<D>__{well white house chief of staff sinclair, by your ninth birthday i had led over two hundred incursions into china and personally killed that many of the enemy. general, put some duct tape over mr. sinclair's fat, ignorant mouth. he has shit for brains and he is wasting my time.}
<A>__{sinclair's irritation is relieved by the naval attache, entering again, who hands him a phone and whispers:}
<C>__{naval attache}
<D>__{the president calling from moscow.}
<A>__{sinclair walks to the far corner of the room with the phone, speaking sotto voice.}
<C>__{general kramer}
<D>__{continue frank.}
<C>__{hummel}
<D>__{eighteen others died in covert, illegal operations in chile and el salvador. remember the gulf war. those pretty "smart bomb" pictures on c.n.n.? my men lased those targets. ten were left to rot outside baghdad when the conflict ended and let's not even mention mogadishu, gentlemen. no benefits were paid to their families; no medals conferred. these men died for their country and they weren't even given a coddamn military burial.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{this situation will not stand: you will transfer 100 million dollars from a grand cayman "red sea trading company" account to an account i designate. from these funds, reparations of one million dollars will be paid to each of the 83 marines, families. the rest of the money will pay for my outfit's expenses. am i clear?}
<C>__{f.b.i. director womack}
<D>__{except for the red sea trading company. what is that?}
<C>__{hummel}
<D>__{identify yourself.}
<C>__{f.b.i. director womack}
<D>__{f.b.i. director womack, general.}
<C>__{hummel}
<D>__{you'll be particularly interested: it's a slush fund where the pentagon keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.}
<C>__{general kramer}
<D>__{frank, jesus, this is classified information.}
<C>__{womack}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{is this true?}
<A>__{general kramer, embarrassed, nods yes.}
<C>__{hummel}
<D>__{if you want the money back, you'll have to tell the attorney general and the boys down at justice where it came from. good luck.}
<A>__{hayden sinclair returns to the table.}
<C>__{hayden sinclair}
<D>__{general, i've just spoken to the president and he is clear as hell on this: we will not negotiate with you and we do not care if ...}
<C>__{hummel}
<D>__{someone please gag that man.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{alert the media, i launch the gas. refuse payment, i launch the gas. it is just after midnight. you have 36 hours all of today and half of tomorrow, until 12 noon to transfer the money. don't even consider the standard counter measure, general.}
<C>__{general kramer}
<D>__{what's the potential casualty rate of a single rocket armed with v.x., general peterson?}
<C>__{general peterson}
<D>__{in a dense urban area, sixty, seventy ...}
<C>__{rayden sinclair}
<D>__{well that's not so bad ...}
<C>__{i general peterson}
<D>__{thousand. seventy thousand. dead. one teaspoon will kill all living organisms in a three story office building. get the point?}
<C>__{f.b.i. director womack}
<D>__{what did hummel mean by ",standard countermeasure," general?}
<C>__{general peterson}
<D>__{napalm. standard pgison gas can be neutralized by napalm. it burns it up consumes it upon detonation. the problem is that v.x. gas is ten times more toxic and designed to withstand napalm. hummel must know about willy peter, general.}
<C>__{general kramer}
<D>__{'course he does.}
<P>__{(explaining to others)}
<D>__{"willy peter," short for "white phosphorous incendiary device," still in its test phase. it detonates at 6,000 degrees, enough to burn up v.x.}
<P>__{(dawning on him)}
<D>__{that explains hummells time frame. he knows we're not operational. what would it take, general?}
<C>__{general peterson}
<D>__{to equip a flight of f 16s with willy peter in 36 hours? an act of god.}
<P>__{(off kramer's look)}
<D>__{all right, we can try. but view the use of willy peter as a secondary initiative.}
<C>__{general kramer}
<P>__{then on to our primary initiative. (hits intercom button)}
<D>__{send in s.e.a.l. team leader anderson. (to f.b.i. womack) who's your best chemical biological man?}
