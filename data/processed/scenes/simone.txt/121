<L>__{exterior viktor's soundstage day}
<A>__{viktor escorts lainey, blindfolded, around the corner of his soundstage. he removes the blindfold. from lainey's point of view we see the sportscar simone drove in "eternity forever" the car tied with a bow.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{happy birthday, lainey. do you like it?}
<C>__{lainey}
<P>__{(taking in the car)}
<D>__{it's fantastic it's too much.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{it's the car she drove in "eternity forever".}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{i know. thank her for me.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(disappointed by her reaction)}
<D>__{it's from both of us. of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit }
<A>__{lainey averts her gaze.}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{ i can't accept it. i don't want a car, dad.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(clearly hurt, not understanding)}
<D>__{why not? i can get you something else. what do you want?}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{the old viktor taransky.}
<P>__{(finally blurting it out)}
<D>__{i liked you better before before all this. you were a loser, dad, but at least you had integrity. i can't stand to see you like this clinging to simone's coattails it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her. and then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{no, that was me.}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{there you go again, blaming yourself. can't you see what she's done to you she's taking advantage, mocking you. you deserve better than simone.}
<P>__{(hasty exit)}
<D>__{i've got to go, dad.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{lainey...}
<A>__{viktor watches lainey depart towards the studio gates.}
