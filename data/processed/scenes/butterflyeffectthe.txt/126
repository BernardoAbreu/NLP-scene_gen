<A>__{evan runs down the front lawn to his car, the honda parked at the bottom of the hill. his face collapses. evan's car has been trashed and is surrounded by broken glass. the seats and tires have been slashed, the hood has been mysteriously yanked off and the steering wheel sits on the roof. the most unnerving thing, however, is a spiked leather dog collar hangs off the rearview mirror. by now a crowd has gathered. evan runs up to people.}
