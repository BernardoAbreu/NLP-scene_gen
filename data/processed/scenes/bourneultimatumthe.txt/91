<A>__{but it's ross, not bourne. ross is hit by paz's shot. he falls, inches from the silver door, dead. blood has splattered on the door.}
<L>__{interior paz's nest}
<A>__{paz snaps his head back to the scope, realizing he's shot the wrong person. then he catches a glimpse of bourne bourne ducks behind the gathering crowd, out of paz's line of sight, and goes to the body.}

<D>__{oh...shit...}
<A>__{then suddenly vosen snaps back to focus:}
<C>__{vosen }
<D>__{get the asset out of there ...}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{what about bourne?}
<A>__{on the hub monitors we see police moving in... vosen doesn't need to see anymore.}
