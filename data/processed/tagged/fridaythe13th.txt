<A>__{there is some light that comes through the cracks and crevices. alice's hands fasten onto the inside lock the dead bolt type which requires a key to unlock it from the other side. alice relaxes a little bit now that she is locked inside. as soon as she relaxes, we hear the front screen door slam. then we hear some shuffling around outside. the lights are turned on.}

<D>__{please kill her, mommy... help me, please. kill her, mommy.}
<A>__{there is the sound of pots being rustled through. then the sound of another door being slammed. alice relaxes again. then there is a silence. alice thinks about unlocking the door now. she reaches out for the lock. then thinks better of the idea. she cases down the door frame to the floor. on all sides are the cans of food and cooking implements. there is a large skillet, some bags of flour, etc. alice covers her head with her arms. the doorknob above her head (a few inches away) turns very slowly. we see it, but she does not. mrs. voorhees' hand finishes turning and now starts to push gently. there is almost no give, but we see that the door is being tested. the voice on the other side is very young, very sing song.}

<A>__{alice jerks back and stands up on the far side of the small room. fists bang in a rage on the floor.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{please...}
<A>__{alice folds her hands at the side of her face. the fist banging gives way to a short silence. the silence is interrupted by a new sound: mrs. voorhees has begun to use her machete to chop away at the outside of the door to the larder. reaction shot: alice... oh, my god... at first we see nothing on our side. then, gradually, we see little slivers of lights admitted by the blade's chops. alice's eyes race around the larder to try to find a weapon, a defense, anything... larger holes are now made. mrs. voorhees stops just long enough to take a peck inside. we can see her eye at the largest hole. she goes back to whacking away at the door. the hole is near the lock. it is soon big enough for mrs. voorhees to reach inside with her hand and turn the rachet. alice realizes she must defend herself. she reaches down and picks up a heavy skillet and, as the door opens, alice raises her weapon and, screaming, charges the woman who is trying to come through the entrance. mrs. voorhees chops down with the machete. alice fends off the blow with the skillet that she holds with both hands above her head. as the machete blade bounces off the skillet, alice is able to swing the skillet downward and hit mrs. voorhees with a solid blow on top of her head. mrs. voorhees sprawls sideways across the table and then collapses in a heap on the floor. alice raises the skillet again to strike. she crosses carefully to mrs. voorhees and pushes her gently with her foot, the way she might poke a dead animal in the roadway. another angle: mrs. voorhees lies totally inert. there is a small puddle of blood under her head. angle on alice: she relaxes, puts down her weapon and crosses slowly out of the room.}

<L>__{exterior lake dawn}
<A>__{alice lies, in mcu, in the canoe, sleeping. she has not changed her position since collapsing a few hours before. the water laps gently against the side of the canoe. very slowly, she wakes. she opens her eyes. the canoe has drifted into the shade of some enormous tree boughs that overhang the edge of the lake. they shade alice from the bright rays of the sun. the canoe rocks gently. alice is still, listening to the sound of the lapping water. suddenly there is a blood curdling scream, a musical stinger, and the screen is filled with the flying, whirling form of mrs. voorhees, who leaps from the overhanging boughs into the canoe, barely missing alice's slumped form! the canoe immediately overturns and both mrs. voorhees and alice try to find their footing in the shallow water. mrs. voorhees is covered in mud and blood. she sees alice struggling to get up and move toward her, brandishing her blood spattered machete. alice turns, sees mrs. voorhees coming. alice grabs a paddle floating near her. mrs. voorhees pushes the canoe to one side, wading through the waist high water as fast as she can. she screams with rage. her face goes through a horrifying transformation. from her mouth comes the voice of jason.}

<A>__{alice can't move fast enough to get away from mrs. voorhees, who is slashing the air with her big knife trying to hit alice. alice slips, falls in the water, gets her footing back and has to turn and block the blow of the machete with the paddle, using it like a staff to ward off the blow. the machete cuts the paddle nearly in half. mrs. voorhees raises the knife for another blow and alice lunges for her knees and succeeds in throwing mrs. voorhees into the water. the machete flies out of her hand and lands in the water. the two women roll in the water. mrs. voorhees is trying to strangle alice, her hands stretching to reach around her throat. they roll over and under the water. we cannot see who is winning. suddenly mrs. voorhees finds her footing and stands up, looking for alice. she is screeching madly.}
