<L>__{exterior farm day}
<A>__{it is a hot summer day. a large run down farm house, several sheds, a red roof barn and a decrepid silo sit between fields of dry, uncut grass, in a serene isolated valley. two men tack together a broken fence that encloses an overgrown paddock. three women work in a vegetable garden. two women hang wet clothes on a clothes line. two men work in a cluttered garage on an old car. four women sit in a circle on a broken down, buckling front porch. one woman breast feeds a new born. the others knit a large blanket. two women and two men swim naked in a swimming hole. a man in his forties sits alone in a room reading. a man chops wood. a bare foot toddler plays alone in the driveway.}
