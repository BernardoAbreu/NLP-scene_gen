<A>__{kable slams open a door marked p4 and stumbles into the car}
<B>__{graveyard...}
<A>__{reality is roaring, spinning... kable slams into the side of a parked car, legs rubber... he looks it over tires flat, no good... he stumbles to the next, then another... another... his head hits a passenger side window,}
<B>__{spiderwebbing it...}
<A>__{finally, the one: a ford f 250 super chief... gun metal grey,}
<B>__{pristine.}
<A>__{note: the f 250 is a concept truck a future design for ford's f line. in our world this is a 2009 factory model, which makes it old, but not antique. the truck is about as badass as you could want, with dark, narrow windows, big ass wheels and a front end that looks like it could punch through}
<B>__{a building or two.}
<A>__{kable gets to the fuel cap door and pries it open... engraved under the cap is a prominent warning:}
<D>__{ethanol only}
<C>__{simon }
<D>__{kable. dude. what are you doing?}
<A>__{kable unscrews the cap and sticks his finger down his throat. dry heave. he does it again this time puts his mouth on the hole and pukes pure liquid into the tank.}
<D>__{simon (o.s.) (cont'd) what the hell?}
<A>__{he stops, doubled over, gasping for breath... then the feeling hits him again and he heaves another fountain down the hole. a blue shows up in the opposite stairwell kable brings his weapon up to hip level and blows him away without looking. his head is clearing. kable looks around, unzips his pants and pisses into the tank. simon is slack jawed, speechless. kable shakes out his head; we can see in his eyes that he's regaining his senses; focusing in. he busts out the driver's side window, gets in; tears open the steering column a blue slayer shows up in the mirror fuck! he cranks the ignition... vruuuumm, kachunk, kachunk... booom! a 50mm shatters the back window and punches a hole into the dashboard. kable checks what's left of the mirror. hackman and six other blue slayers are coming fast.}
<D>__{simon (o.s.) (cont'd) go, go, go!}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{yeah? anything else ya fuckin cheerleader?}
<A>__{vruuuuum, vruuum... kable hammers on the pedal again, knocking out the old ghosts vrroooooomm!! he slams it into gear and peels out. hackman leaps onto the side of the moving truck and points}
