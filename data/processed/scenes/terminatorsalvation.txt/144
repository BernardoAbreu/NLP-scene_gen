<A>__{the prisoners smash the glass doors off their hinges, and charge past the control robots, which are now coming to life. electric bursts drop a couple of slow moving escapees as they dash into the garage and make for any available vehicle. former prisoners hijack buses, hydrogen cars. pure chaos, it feels like a prison riot. marcus, star and kyle weave amidst the robots and humans.}

<D>__{stay down!}
<A>__{kyle and star take cover behind a concrete post just as plasma bursts explode around them. skeletal terminators armed with plasma rifles are pouring in through the opening garage gate. a stolen bus heads for the exit, knocking a couple of terminators aside and smashing through the rising gate, clearing a path for others to follow. a skeletal terminator sets its sights on a moving hydrogen car, which follows the bus terminator pov red filter, highlighting bull, the driver. "target acquired terminate." the terminator shoots his rifle through the car's windshield it explodes, close to kyle and star, the building shakes. kyle and star flee the flames, the terminator's head swivels quickly, taking them in. it starts to pursue, but marcus gets in front of it. before it can fire }

<D>__{it's ok, i'm not human!}
<A>__{the terminator pauses, looks him over. terminator pov marcus is quickly scanned, comes up "non organic do not terminate." the terminator starts to move past marcus, who leaps on it and wrenches the rifle from its grasp. as the robot spins on him he blows its head off, then looks around frantically for the kids. a moment later kyle roars up at the controls of a futuristic atv, star clinging to him.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{you can't drive!}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{watch me!}
<A>__{no time to argue, marcus leaps into the back beside star and kyle guns it out of there, careening off walls and other vehicles, he's still not much of a driver. marcus meanwhile picks off potential threats with the plasma rifle.}
