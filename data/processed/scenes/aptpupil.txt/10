<L>__{interior dussander's living room day}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{you should be a detective.}
<A>__{the sounds of a refrigerator opening and closing come from the kitchen. drinks being poured. todd begins to move slowly toward the kitchen.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{maybe i will... mom thinks i'd be good at it.}
<L>__{interior dussander's kitchen day}
<A>__{he reaches the doorway just as dussander turns around with the drinks.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i found fourteen compares.}
<A>__{dussander approaches him carrying a tumbler of milk and a glass of bourbon. he hands the tumbler to todd, who brings it up to his lips and hesitates.}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{you have some.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{good gott.}
<A>__{he snatches the cup and swallows twice.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{you see? it's milk, boy. from dairylee farms. on the carton is a picture of a smiling cow.}
<A>__{todd pauses and then begins to drink.}
<C>__{dussander }
<P>__{(more to himself than todd)}
<D>__{...and two missing children.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{boy what you have done, i have to explain this to you because clearly you don't understand, what you have done is a violation.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{a violation?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{kind of like those experiments with the decompression chamber. now, that was a violation, dussander.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{that fucking name. enough of that. i demand it.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you what?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i demand }
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you demand nothing from me. ever. get it?}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{boy, i will tell you this once more, and for the last time. my name is arthur denker. it has never been anything else. it has never even been americanized. if you must know, and apparently you must, i was named by my father who greatly admired the stories of arthur conan doyle. i did serve in the reserves, i admit, and in the late thirties, when i was first married, i supported hitler. i supported him most, i suppose, because for the first time in years there was work and there was tobacco. ...would you like a cigarette?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{no. my dad used to smoke. mom made him quit. now he's addicted to nicorette... that's nicotine gum.}
<A>__{dussander turns toward the counter and pulls a kitchen match from a cabinet. he lights his cigarette with his back to todd.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{nicotine gum.}
<A>__{dussander's eyes drift to the collection of kitchen knives neatly stuffed in their block on the counter in front of him. he lingers a moment, pulls deeply on the cigarette, then turns and continues.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{anyway, hitler lost his mind at the end, directing phantom armies at the whim of his astrologer. he even gave his dog, blondi, a death capsule. on may 2nd, 1945, my regiment surrendered to the americans. i remember that a private named gonzales gave me a chocolate bar. i wept.}
<A>__{bored, todd sinks into a chair at the table.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{i was interned at essen where i was treated very well. we listened to the nuremberg trials on the radio and when goering committed suicide, i bought half a bottle of schnaps and got drunk. when i was released, i put wheels on cars at the essen motor works until i retired in 1963. in 1967 i emigrated here, to california, and became a u.s. citizen. i am as american as you are. i vote. no buenos aires, no berlin, no koo ba. and that's it, my whole story. i hope you're satisfied. but if not, it's, as you say, tough shit for you. now, you go. enough of this.}
<A>__{dussander points to the door, but todd remains motionless in his chair.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{that was pretty good. so much to remember. but i guess it helps when you have forty years to practice your story.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{oh, to hell with this and to hell with you. i'm calling the police. your father is going to beat your behind when he picks you up at the police station.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{no. my parents don't believe in violence.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{well, they should start. i'm calling.}
<A>__{dussander steps past todd and picks up the receiver of the phone hanging on the wall above the table. the boy still sits motionless behind him. dussander dials a "9", and then, with more difficulty, a "1". he stands with his finger poised over the final "1". tiny beads of sweat roll over his forehead. his shoulders drop. todd stands up. their faces are close together.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{hang up the phone.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{this is unforgivable. do you know the things you're accusing me of?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{do it.}
<A>__{slowly, dussander brings the receiver down onto its hook.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{if you don't want money, what do you want?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i want to hear about it.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{hear about what?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{the camps. everything. the experiments. the examinations. all the stuff the writers are scared to put in their books because people will think they're sick. that's what i want, ... everything.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{everything?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{exactly. and you're going to tell it to me.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{you're a monster.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{according to history you're the monster.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{how could you ask me to remember such things? i can barely remember to take my heart medicine.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you were there. you did those things. no one can tell it better than you can. and you will tell it, starting today. right now. if you don't, i will tell everyone who you are. i swear it.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{why should i? why should i do any of it?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{because you hung up the phone. that's why. ...and just so you know, just so there is no misunderstanding whatsoever. everything i have on you, the compares, the want sheet, all the photographs, are all in an envelope under my mattress. i'm going to put it there every time i come to see you. if anything happens to me, if i should suddenly disappear, some one will find it. believe me }
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{that's a foolish thing to do. what if your mother goes in your room anyway? what if she hires a maid?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you better hope she doesn't.}
<P>__{(looking at watch)}
<D>__{we're wasting time. let's get started. i have to be home for dinner. today i want to hear about the ovens. how you baked them after they were dead... and before.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{dussander}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{a boy... a boy...}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{but before we start, put your teeth in. you look better with your teeth.}
