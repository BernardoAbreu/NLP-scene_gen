<L>__{interior the blandings' bedroom day}
<A>__{jim (cary grant) and muriel (myrna loy) blandings are asleep in twin beds. the room, not large to begin with, gives us the impression of being cluttered up and overcrowded because the beds, oversized chest of drawers, dressing table and chaise lounge take up an inordinate amount of space. sound of an alarm clock going off. jim awakens, yawns himself into hazy consciousness, gropes about on the night table for the clock; it isn't there. he slips out of bed, and rubbing his eyes, blindly moves toward the dresser. the circuitous path, which he accomplishes with sleepy dexterity, entails going around the chaise lounge, just missing the ominously pointed edge of muriel's dressing table, deftly stepping over the low dressing table chair and finally reaching the chest of drawers upon which is the clock. he turns off the alarm and yawningly starts back over the same path. we get the feeling that jim makes this sleepy excursion every waking morning of his life. back at his bed, jim sits down, and, yawning loudly, gropes with his feet for his slippers. before he can find them, however, he begins to doze off and slowly tilts back toward the pillow, pulling the covers over him. in a moment he is sound asleep. muriel's arm automatically stretches out and shakes jim into consciousness. as he painfully reawakens and starts to rise, muriel's arm disappears. we get the impression that this, too, is a regular part of the blandings' daily routine. jim locates his slippers, reaches around for his bathrobe, can't find it, stumbles his way over to the closet, opens the door.}
