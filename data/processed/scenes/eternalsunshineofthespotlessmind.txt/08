<A>__{joel talks on a phone. the wind howls around him. he tries to shield the mouthpiece as he talks.}

<D>__{hi, cindy. joel. listen, i'm not feeling well this morning. no. food poisoning, i think. sorry it took me so long to call in, but i've been vomiting.}
<L>__{exterior beach day}
<A>__{joel wanders the windy, empty beach, with his briefcase. he passes an old man with a metal detector. they nod at each other. later: joel looks out at the ocean. later: joel sits on a rock and pulls out a notebook. he opens it and writes with a gloved hand.}

<D>__{january 13th, 2006. today i skipped work and took the train out to montauk.}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{it's cold.}
<P>__{(thinks some more)}
<D>__{the sky is gray.}

<D>__{i don't know what else to say. nothing happens. nothing changes. i saw naomi last night. we had sex. it was weird to fall into our old familiar sex life so easily. like no time has passed. after two years apart suddenly we're talking about getting together again. i guess that's good.}
<A>__{he has no other thoughts. he glances up, spots a female figure in the distance, walking in his direction. she stands out against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded sweatshirt. it's clementine. he watches her for a bit, then as she nears, he goes back to his writing, or at least pretends to. once she passed, he watches her walk away. she stops and stares out at the ocean. joel writes.}
<D>__{joel (v.o.) (cont'd) if i'm constitutionally incapable of making eye contact with a woman i don't know. i guess i'd better get back to naomi.}
<A>__{later: joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the season. he peeks cautiously in a dark window. later: joel digs into the sand with a stick.}
