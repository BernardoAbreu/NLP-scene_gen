<L>__{interior church nave night}
<A>__{as the window explodes toward grange and he sucks big hits from behind, dropping the crow. the bird hits the ground, flapping weakly. lao guards #3 & #4 exchange a look and whip up their calicos,}
<B>__{returning fire.}
<L>__{exterior church night}
<A>__{albrecht takes cover as a lot of religious stuff is noisily destroyed all around his position. chunks of the window continue to disintegrate.}
<L>__{interior church alter (night)}
<A>__{eric tuck and rolls out of the way as we go close on lao, screaming.}
<C>__{lao}
<D>__{i said no shooting!}
<A>__{then he's ducking bullets himself as albrecht steps in through the blown out window, the machine gun stuttering on slugs. the sanctuary comes apart around lao. he retreats to the alter and exits whence he came. tight on pew eric dives just as guard #4 comes after him with the sword, which chomps into the wood and gets stuck there. guard #4 releases it and cross draws his calico as eric springs back into the frame straight up. tight on guard #4 as eric's lancing foot propels him backward before he can fire.}
