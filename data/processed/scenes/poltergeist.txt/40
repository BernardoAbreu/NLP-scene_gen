<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{steve is on the phone, nervously smoking a cigarette as the bulldozer can be seen out the window, digging the new pool. diane is serving waffles around the breakfast table. e. buzz sits at robbie’s feet, watching the waffles hopefully. only carol anne seems to have an appetite.}
<C>__{steven}
<P>__{(on the phone)}
<D>__{i’m not kidding, jeff. how could anyone sleep through a six point five. yes, damage. stuff’s in pieces all over our bedroom.}
<C>__{diane}
<P>__{(quietly to carol anne)}
<D>__{chew each bite ten times.}
<A>__{carol anne exaggerates her chewing; smiling with her mouth full.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{i know that... we’ve had the radio on and there’s nothing about it.}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{after the sylmar quake it was two years before real estate was on the rise.}
<A>__{diane is gently coaxing some information out of carol anne who mostly has her mouth full of waffles and blueberries.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{when you said, “they’re here” last night.}
<C>__{carol anne}
<D>__{can i take my goldfish to school?}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{maybe the fault line runs just under our house. wouldn’t that be a scream?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{the ceiling got crumbs all over my bed.}
<C>__{diane}
<P>__{(to carol anne)}
<D>__{sweetheart. do you remember last night? do you remember when you woke up and said, “they’re here?”}
<C>__{carol anne}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{who did you mean? who’s here?}
<C>__{carol anne}
<P>__{(mouth full)}
<D>__{the tv people.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{she’s stoned.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{what do you know about it?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{more’n you. ask dad.}
<A>__{robbie picks up his milk to take a sip when the bottom of the glass drops out, the milk splashing back onto robbie’s cereal bowl, overflowing cereal all over the table and onto dana’s blouse in a burst, perhaps slightly strong for the small amount of spilled milk.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{hey !}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(throwing up his hands)}
<D>__{it’s not my mess.}
<C>__{dana}
<P>__{(jumps up from the table)}
<D>__{thanks a lot, jerko i’ve got class in twenty minutes.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{mom.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{gimme that thing before you cut yourself.}
<A>__{carol anne has a big dripping splash of milk running down her forehead. oblivious to this she just keeps eating, goes over to the kitchen tv... turns it on to the “today show”, then switches to an “in between” channel and watches the snow.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{i’m outta here! see ya early.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(imitating dad)}
<D>__{i’m outta here!}
<C>__{diane}
<P>__{(pushing him back)}
<D>__{you i can handle.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i got school!!}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{breakfast first.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{all right, i’ll just flunk.}
<A>__{robbie shrugs, reaches for his spoon to resume eating and notices something unusual. the spoon is bent. he looks around the table. every spoon is bent. shrugging it off, robbie lifts his cereal bowl and drinks right out of it, two tiny trails dripping off his chin, spotting his school shirt.}
