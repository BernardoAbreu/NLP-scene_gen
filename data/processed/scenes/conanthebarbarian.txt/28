<B>__{notched arm}
<A>__{where there was once a single notch, there are now five such notches, on a much broader arm that struggles to pin another powerful looking arm.}
<L>__{interior bar messantia night}
<A>__{a raucous bar on the argossean waterfront. out the window we see a port lined with shemish galleys and junks from kush. the bar is filled with the hearty sailors and merchants of those ships, and those who desire to part them from their hard earned money; zamoran thieves, hyborean mercenaries and brythunian whores. most of them watch the arm wrestling match taking place at the back of the bar. a pair of city guards, short swords sheathed at their sides, enter the bar and are immediately summoned over by the harried barkeep.}
<C>__{barkeep}
<D>__{he's back there.}
<A>__{the barkeep motion to the arm wrestlers.}
<D>__{city guard #1 what's this one done?}
<C>__{barkeep}
<D>__{what's he done?! what hasn't he done? he's bedded six of my whores and finished off three casks of mead and he hasn't paid so much as a silver piece for it. city guard #1 so have your men deal with him.}
<C>__{barkeep}
<D>__{i did.}
<A>__{behind the bar, six men each hold down two hulking men yelling in agony as their horribly broken arms are snapped back into place.}
<D>__{city guard #2 sounds like a real problem. too bad we have other places to be right now.}
<A>__{the barkeep shakes his head, knowing the routine. he slips a pair of silver pieces into the soldier's hand.}
<C>__{barkeep}
<D>__{just get that behemoth out of here.}
<A>__{the two city guards make their way to the back of the bar. his back to them, the drunken man they're after struggles to pin his opponent, cobras beneath each of their wrists, ready to strike at the loser. a pair of voluptuous whores watch, caressing the drunken man's sinewy back. the drunken man yells in fury as he slams the other man's hand down upon the cobra, which immediately bites its prey. as the soldiers arrive, the drunken victor throws his tankard of ale at the barkeep, who's now back behind the bar.}
<C>__{drunken man}
<D>__{piss water! you'll serve my friends and i your best, barman, or you'll taste steel! city guard #1 time to leave, northerner.}
<A>__{the drunken man turns as the city guard puts a hand on his shoulder.}
<B>__{conan}
<A>__{the gangly fifteen year old boy has grown into a powerfully built man, broad shouldered with sun browned skin lined with battle scars. only the piercing blue eyes and square cut black mane remain from the boy we last saw. conan stands to his full height, looming over the smaller city guards, who instinctively take a step back.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{no, my small friends. it's time to die. now }
<A>__{conan sways. the room spins. he falls on his face.}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{who's first }
