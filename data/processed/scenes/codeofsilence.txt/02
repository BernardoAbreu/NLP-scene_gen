<L>__{exterior alley day}
<A>__{the el train rumbles north past the aging tenements of uptown into the belmont avenue station. and down below, a garbage truck is slowly working its way up the alley. a garbage man in city overalls whistles to the driver and the truck stops. he rolls a can to the grinding jaw as the driver sits, tense and alert, scanning the street. there's something odd about this driver. and the garbage man too, for that matter.}
