<L>__{interior a room in leopold's house salzburg night 1780's}
<A>__{there is a view of a castle in background. leopold sits alone in his room. he is reading a letter from wolfgang. at his feet are his trunks, half packed for the journey he will not now take. we hear mozart's voice reading the following letter and we see, as the camera roves around the room, mementos of the young prodigy's early life: the little forte piano made for him; the little violin made for him; an order presented to him. we see a little starling in a wicker cage. and we see portraits of the boy on the walls, concluding with the familiar family portrait of wolfgang and his sister nannerl seated at the keyboard with leopold standing, and the picture of their mother on the wall behind them.}

<D>__{most beloved father, it is done. do not blame me that i did not wait to see your dear face. i knew you would have tried to dissuade me from my truest happiness and i could not have borne it. your every word is precious to me. remember how you have always told me vienna is the city of musicians. to conquer here is to conquer europe! with my wife i can do it. i vow i will become regular in my habits and productive as never before. she is wonderful, papa, and i know that you will love her. and one day soon when i am a wealthy man, you will come and live with us, and we will be so happy. i long for that day, best of papas, and kiss your hand a hundred thousand times.}
