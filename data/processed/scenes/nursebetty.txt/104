<L>__{interior rosa's apartment later}
<A>__{rosa enters, tosses her purse on the table and goes straight to the vcr. written in magic marker on a video is "a reason to love, apr. 23." the tape sue ann gave to betty. she pops it in and turns it on. the opening titles start ... the characters appear ... one is an impossibly handsome man over the title "doctor david ravell."}
<L>__{interior hospital pharmacy later still}
<A>__{betty working at a desk in the pharmacy. the same clerk as before busies himself at another counter. rosa appears at the glass partition and raps urgently on it.}

<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{on television!!}
<P>__{(off betty's puzzled look)}
<D>__{cut the shit, will you!}
<A>__{a beat. rosa slams the videotape down on the counter.}
<C>__{rosa }
<D>__{either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. which one is it?!}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i have no idea what you're talking about.}
<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{i'm talking about david ravell!!}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{shhh! i heard you the first time.}
<C>__{rosa}
<P>__{(suddenly calm)}
<D>__{i spent my weekend looking for someone who does not exist. i should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but i was with you.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{if you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! is this about gas money?}
<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{it's not about gas money!!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! not the actor whose name is george, by the way. his character!}
<A>__{rosa stands over betty, fuming.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{are you having a nervous breakdown?}
<A>__{rosa screams and smacks her hand on the glass as betty watches. several people in a nearby lounge look up. rosa stares at them until they look away.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{why'd you help me in the first place?}
<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{i helped you because i'm an idiot! ask my mother, i love it when people take advantage of me! i trusted you!! i thought he was real!}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{he is real!!}
<A>__{betty tries to return to her work but rosa confronts her loudly. the nearby visitors and staff pretend to be busy.}
<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{you need help, betty! even if this is your idea of a joke, you need serious help!!}
<P>__{(walking away to herself)}
<D>__{necesitas un mdico! pront simo!}
<B>__{on betty}
<A>__{fuming in her humiliation. after a moment, rosa reappears at the window.}
<C>__{rosa }
<D>__{i'm not going back on our arrangement. my word is good, and my family owes you. but i think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{fine.}
