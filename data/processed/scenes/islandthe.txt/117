<A>__{v a u l t e d . arched windows, mosaiced i n polarized glass. sunlight falls in filtered shafts. footfalls echo off polished granite. lincoln and ester scan around. ester looks daunted by the space. lincoln looks focused. he sees people in line, transacting.}
<L>__{interior. ticket window day}
<A>__{the sign on the window reads "tickets". lincoln assimilates. the word is familiar. he steps up to the counter with ester. a ticket clerk female, immaculately groomed greets them with a glossy smile. lincoln offers her the blue card. she seems not to notice.}

<C>__{diggs}
<D>__{j u s t wanted to help, that's all.}
<A>__{d i g g s shrugs, disarming, trying to win them over, nice and easy per the mandate. then he notices the eyes of his male quarry. the pupils, black and dilating. suddenly the male jerks away, like a shying horse, drawing the female with him. diggs, unperturbed, makes no attempt to follow. turning his back on them, he touches a device concealed in his ear canal, a miniature two way radio }
<C>__{diggs }
<D>__{b u r d i e , it's them. east exit.}
