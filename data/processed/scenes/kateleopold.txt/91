<L>__{interior subway night}
<A>__{the subway car is inhabited solely by leopold, charlie, and the oldest ukrainian woman in new york city. despite the fact that the train is empty, they are all seated on the same bench. charlie stares straight ahead refusing to even look at leopold. the ukrainian woman hangs on every word.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{just drop it leopold.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{but charles, it is so ridiculous. i am not interested in her.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hah!}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{in any case the problem is not with me but with you.}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{you have no idea what it takes to go about courting a woman. from what i've witnessed tonight, it is symptomatic of your entire generation.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(almost speechless)}
<D>__{you are some piece of work, leopold.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{now i do not wish to get personal...}
<A>__{charlie bursts into ironic laughter and looks at the old woman. she rolls her eyes.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{but you have been of great assistance to me and i feel this is one area where i can be of some real help.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm fascinated. go on.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{now, why was i successful with this young lady and why did you so miserably fail?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what makes you think she likes you?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{well she gave me the number of her telephone and i assumed it meant...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{as i see it, the girl hasn't an inkling of your intentions. and it's no wonder. you, charles, are a merry andrew.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{a what?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{a merry andrew.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i am not!!}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{everything plays like a farce to you. the more wit, the less courage. i believe the modern woman desires passion, protection, sensitivity. no woman wants to be romanced by a buffoon.}
<P>__{(the old woman shakes her head)}
<D>__{banter and repartee are fine but you must add to that a different sort of playfulness.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you think i should pounce?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i'm saying you must treat her with respect. any oaf can attempt a crude pass. a woman of kate's stature would never respond to an artificial tactic.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{kate?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you said kate.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i did not.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yes you did. didn't he say kate?}
<A>__{the old woman nods.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{we are discussing your problem.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{not anymore. you like my sister.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{charles...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{she has trouble with men, you know.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{perhaps she has not met the right one.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{she has met the right one. hundreds of times. but she pulls back. she cuts herself off. you turn around and suddenly you're dating a sphinx.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{one never can tell.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{does kate know how you feel?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{have you made your intentions known to her?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{who's the merry andrew now?! i think you're all talk and no action. what are you waiting for?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i do not know if there is a future in it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well leopold, no one ever does...}
