<L>__{interior sheldon's dressing room after the show}
<A>__{a happy spinner (still in costume as moochy) pokes his head into sheldon's dressing room. sheldon, still in costume as well, looks drained after the difficult taping.}
<C>__{spinner}
<D>__{that was fun! was it bad when i done that thing, where i tripped and knocked over the flamingo and then he knocked over the cameraman and then those lights fell down on that lady's head?}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{it's fine, spinner. we'll edit it out. but tomorrow in rehearsal we're gonna work on a new thing called 'the importance of hitting your mark.'}
<C>__{spinner}
<D>__{great! i get to hit something!}
<A>__{spinner dances off. a beat later, nora enters and shuts the door. there's an awkward beat of silence.}

<C>__{sheldon}

<D>__{ever since you've been back i just feel like there's something that's not connecting.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i guess i'm still readjusting a little. like a guy who's come back from the war. not that i'd equate my misfortune with the brave men and women who protect us overseas.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i just thought we were on our way to something... granted, my mistaken belief that you had ties to neo nazis might have put a damper on our relationship, but i'm sorry for }
<A>__{sheldon suddenly jumps up and grabs her. he kisses her passionately. nora immediately starts ripping off his costume as they make out. they fall to the floor in a lustful embrace.}
