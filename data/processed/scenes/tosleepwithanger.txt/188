<A>__{two paramedics work on harry. one of the paramedics is a young asian. the other is white with red hair. they listen for a heart beat and shake their heads in a negative manner. they pack up their medical case. the asian's accent is very difficult to understand.}
<C>__{white paramedic}
<D>__{there is nothing we can do for him.}
<A>__{the paramedics start to leave without the body.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{well, aren't you going to take him with you?}
<C>__{asian paramedic}
<D>__{if he had died in our care, we would be required to take him. since we found him dead, you will have to wait for the county to pick him up.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{how long will that take?}
<C>__{white paramedic}
<D>__{that would depend on how busy it is. i'm sorry.}
