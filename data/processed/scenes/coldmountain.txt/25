<A>__{monroe circulates, with ada. he nods at a group of men, who congregate in one part, not mingling. their leader, teague, might be a minister himself, favouring a black dress coat, a black crow in the corner, eyes flashing. ada doesn't know them. esco comes by. monroe puts a hand on his arm.}
<C>__{monroe}
<D>__{esco, our friends there }
<P>__{(indicating teague and co.)}
<D>__{ they helped build the chapel?}
<C>__{esco}
<D>__{that's teague and his boys. i'd recommend you kick them out except a man don't kick a snake. one time the teague family owned the whole of cold mountain. my farm, your farm, all belonged to his grand daddy. teague wanted this place bad. you got it. he's here sniffing out an advantage.}
<C>__{monroe}
<D>__{there's no advantage here, but to celebrate a job well done. cheers }
<P>__{(he raises his glass)}
<D>__{ and thank you.}
<A>__{and teague raises his glass across the room.}
