<A>__{the room is mostly darkness. sounds are more tangible here than sights. we see jake's body as it passes through the slit of light. jake crouches into the corner away from the light. as we see jake's face, the following montage images appear. (there will be contrasting sound effects accompanying the images: for example, the image of jake hitting vickie might be accompanied by the sounds from a love scene between them.) a) 1940s black and white pornography: partially clothed men and women engaged in explicit sex acts. b) boxing magazines: fighters' beaten and bloody faces. a body building ad: charles atlas raises his muscled biceps. c) li'l abner comics; daisy mae's tits seem about to fall free. d) reprise from earlier scene: back in jake and irma's old apartment, joey, using a towel as a glove, punches jake in the face. e) a 1934 "older girl" sashays into the candy store in flickering 8mm black and white footage. we see ohter bronx preteen girls walking, smiling. f) at shorehaven pool, jake and joey, in bathing suits, are sleeping in the sun next to each other. other bathers are around, also taking in the sun. g) reprise from earlier scene: as in d, joey hits jake in the face again. we see again the image of jake's face as he sits in his cell. the montage continues: h) janiro's face at the weigh in. i) jake throws janiro a kiss at the weigh in. j) jake punches in janiro's face. k) a naked girl stands in the doorway of a bedroom. l) jake lies in bed with irma staring at the ceiling. m) vickie's pretty young face double exposes with sugar ray robinson's. n) dr. pinto injects novacaine into jake's fists. o) sitting in his corner of the ring, jake spits blood into a pail... p) still in jake's corner: joey wipes off his brother's bloody face. q) still in jake's corner: there is an open cut over jake's eye. joey, rushing against time, sucks the blood from the wound as dr. pinto begins to examine it. r) still in jake's corner: joey puts the mouthpiece in jake's mouth. (slow motion) s) jake wins over cerdan. joey, overenthusiastic, hits jake on the back of the head a little too hard. jake gives joey a quick look, but joey just embraces him. t) on a bed, a girl is going down on joey. the girl turns and looks up at jake. it's linda, the waitress from his club. jake stares. u) jake's fist hits linda's face. v) vickie playfully bends jake's hand back, pretending to break it. w) jake hits linda again. she cries. x) repeat image n: dr. pinto injects novocaine into jake's fists. we see again the image of jake's face as he sits in his cell. the montage continues: y) vickie is in her underwear in a bedroom. a pair of black arms come in and embrace her body. z) close up of jake; he reacts to this. he's in the ring with sugar ray. he knocks sugar ray out of the ring. aa) vickie again. jake approaches her from behind, pulls her head back by her hair, and slaps her. bb) the announcer points to sugar ray as the winner.
