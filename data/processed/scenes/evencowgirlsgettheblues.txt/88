<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{sissy is hitchhiking with her new thumb. but cars pass one after another without stopping. until sissy finally tries her left thumb, which has been spared the knife. with this thumb there are new maneuvers to try out. and as soon as the does, a car stops. mosaic of hitchhiking brilliance with sissy's use of her left thumb. a clock is ticking past twelve then on to six and past eight.... she dances wildly around traffic, stopping the hardest of drivers, the clock ticks away and within thirty hours she is approaching mottburg again.}
