<L>__{exterior canal street night 12 young back on the job, moving with traffic.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{rule number one: don't get involved with patients. rule number two: don't get involved with patient's daughters. you understand?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what about rule number three: don't get involved with dispatchers named love.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you don't know the first thing about rule number three, cannot begin to understand the complexities of that rule. come on, let's go look at some hookers. the kit kat will be letting out.}
<P>__{(relevant to nothing)}
<D>__{don't ever call a junkie whore a crackhead. they get real mad.}
<A>__{marcus swings up first ave:}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{look at these women. you can't even tell who's a hooker anymore. whatever happened to go go boots and hot pants? they wear anything now, walk outta the house with whatever they got on ...}
<A>__{frank watches night tableaus (police cars flashing, lovers kissing, woman crying hysterically, drunken slugfest) as his mind wanders:}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{the street is so much more unpredictable than the er and to prepare for the unexpected i was taught to act without thinking, like an army private who can take apart and reassemble a gun blindfolded ...}
<A>__{frank notices another ems bus: tom walls wheeling a stretcher noel, face bloodied, lies restrained as walls' partner opens the rear doors.}
<D>__{frank (v.o.) (cont'd) i realized that my training was useful in less than ten percent of the calls and saving someone's life was rarer than that. as the years went by i grew to understand that my role was less about saving lives than about bearing witness. i was a grief mop and much of my job was to remove, if even for a short time, the grief starter or the grief product. it was enough i simply showed up.}
<A>__{marcus continues as if uninterrupted:}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{... look at her. leaves you no idea what's underneath, not even a suggestion. could be a skeleton for all you know.}
<A>__{they pass a working girl in a rain slicker who pulls off her hood to look at them: a familiar face.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. there's a mystery to it, then she shows you.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{she's no whore, marcus.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{we're all whores, frank. you know what i'm talking about, the way she looked at me.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{she wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.}
<A>__{frank, looking back at the rose face, hears her faintly say:}
<D>__{"rose" why did you kill me, frank?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i didn't kill you.}
<A>__{marcus, not hearing "rose's" voice, replies:}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{no, you didn't, frank, thank you. but there's still a couple hours left on the shift.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i need a drink, that's all.}
<A>__{dispatcher love's voice cuts through:}
<C>__{dispatcher love}
<D>__{twelve young, answer the radio. i have a call for you.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{she said to me, i love the way you talk on the radio.}
<C>__{dispatcher love}
<D>__{i can't wait all night, young. i'm holding a priority and if you don't answer i'm going to knock you out of service.}
<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(keys radio)}
<D>__{don't worry, hon. young is here and he's gonna help out just remember, you owe me.}
<C>__{dispatcher love}
<D>__{you're going to three four avenue c, 17 year old female cardiac arrest, no further information.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{ten four, hon.}
<A>__{marcus hits the siren.}
