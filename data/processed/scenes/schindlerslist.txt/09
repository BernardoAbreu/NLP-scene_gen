<L>__{interior st. mary's cathedral day}
<A>__{a dark and cavernous place. a priest performing mass to scattered parishioners. lots of empty pews. the young polish jew from the street, poldek pfefferberg, kneels, crosses himself, and slides in next to another young man, goldberg, going over notes scribbled on a little pad inside a missal. pfefferberg shows him a container of shoe polish he takes from his pocket. whispered, bored }
<C>__{goldberg}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{you don't recognize it? maybe that's because it's not what i asked for.}
<C>__{goldberg}
<D>__{you asked for shoe polish.}
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{my buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the army. but by the time it got there because of the cold it broke, the whole truckload.}
<C>__{goldberg}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{so i'm responsible for the weather?}
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{i asked for metal, you gave me glass.}
<C>__{goldberg}
<D>__{this is not my problem.}
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{look it up.}
<A>__{goldberg doesn't bother; he pockets his little notepad and intones a response to the priest's prayer, all but ignoring pfefferberg.}
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{this is not your problem? everybody wants to know who i got it from, and i'm going to tell them.}
<A>__{goldberg glances to pfefferberg for the first time, and, greatly put upon, takes out his little notepad again and makes a notation in it.}
<C>__{goldberg}
<D>__{metal.}
<A>__{he flips the pad closed, pockets it, crosses himself as he gets up, and leaves.}
