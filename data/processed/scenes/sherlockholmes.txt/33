<A>__{watson and holmes ride in a cab, passing familiar landmarks as the city comes to life. they sit in silence, tension hanging between them. finally holmes grabs watson's bag, rummages around and pulls out a clean white shirt. watson looks out the window, frustrated. he sees the half constructed mass of tower bridge. near ground level, workers take down a large blackwood steel sign.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{look at that structure. what has it been? five years' work already? are you aware that is the first combination of bascule and suspension bridge. very innovative.}
<A>__{no reply. as holmes is taking off his jacket, he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a wad of money.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{oh, i have your cut from last night, by the way. you weren't there so i laid your customary bet }
<A>__{silence. holmes takes off his shirt.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you're right... i will keep it with your check book, locked safely away in my drawer.}
<A>__{silence. holmes pulls on the clean shirt.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{the opera house is featuring don giovanni and i could easily procure two tickets if you had some cultural inclination this evening.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you have the grand gift of silence, watson. it makes you quite invaluable as a companion.}
<A>__{watson punches him square in the face.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{and your grand gift is the uncanny ability to demoralize people. i was aware she'd been engaged. she told me.}
<A>__{holmes rubs his jaw.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{so that's a `no' to the opera then?}
<A>__{watson's steaming. holmes puts on his vest.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{that's my waistcoat.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it's too small for you.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{well, it's my property and i want it back. 26aa.}
<A>__{holmes hands him the waistcoat which he promptly tosses out of the carriage window. holmes frowns, looks out the opposite window.}
