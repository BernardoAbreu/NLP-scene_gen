<A>__{the lieutenant looks up, puzzled. rambo is going berserk. his body is an out of control machine, lashing and tearing at the frame. the scream breaks and becomes a ferocious howl. the viet guard steps forward, alarmed and unnerved. his rifle is raised, warding off evil. podovsk motions him back and steps closer himself. the bedframe begins to twist, creaking and warping under rambo's frenzied assault. tight cuts rapid succession a weld. springs pop. podovsk takes a reflexive step forward. rambo's hand shoots out, free suddenly, like a grappling hook. palyushin hits the current. rambo jerks podovsk into a headlock, a death embrace. podovsk screams. convulses.}
