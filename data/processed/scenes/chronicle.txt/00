<A>__{the room is dingy. unkempt. the camera sits on the bed, on its side, facing the door. we can hear someone moving around off screen. the door handle clicks; someone's trying it. then nothing. then, suddenly, loud pounding on the door. andrew's voice is scratchy and prone to cracking. he speaks with a rushed mix of fear and anxiety.}
