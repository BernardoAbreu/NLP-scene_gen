<L>__{exterior house night later}
<A>__{the rain is coming down in torrents.}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{we are close on erica's face upside down, hanging off the side of the bed. she's sweaty, flushed, overwhelmed...}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{oh my god, i do like sex.}
<A>__{camera twirls around and we find harry, sprawled nearby, catching his breath, satisfied, stunned, scared.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you certainly do.}
<A>__{erica arrives next to him, also out of breath.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{wow. so this is what you're supposed to do on a rainy afternoon...}
<A>__{harry smiles. he's trying to be his debonair self but something's off. he's very aware of himself. they lie there quietly for a second when erica begins to tear up. harry slowly, nervously turns to her.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i really thought i was sorta closed for business. just never expected this.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{nothin's ever surprised me more...}
<A>__{flattered, erica snuggles up close. harry puts his arm around her. then, with no warning, his eyes fill with tears.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{this is crazy. i can't remember the last time i cried. i think i'm overwhelmed.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(crying with him)}
<D>__{me too. that's the perfect word.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{baby, i had sex three days after a heart attack and i didn't die!}
<A>__{erica pauses. oh. that kind of overwhelmed.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that's gotta be some kind of record.}
<A>__{good sport erica gives him a double thumbs up.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(wiping her tears)}
<D>__{let's not brag about this to our doctor, okay?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{honey i may not be many things but one thing i am is a gentleman.}
<A>__{harry holds her close.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{erica, erica, erica.}
<P>__{(she turns to him)}
<D>__{you know i'm not good at being monogamous, right?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{monogamous? please, i hardly know you.}
<A>__{he looks at her wondering if she's for real. she smiles as she wipes a small tear from the corner of her eye. then he kisses her. later they're huddled under the covers cozy. candles light the room. it's still raining.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{ so there i was at nineteen, in new york, by myself, and i'd never seen snow before and i didn't have enough money for the bus, so i had to walk. had no idea how far it was and i'm talking blizzard and i'm in sneakers.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{awwwww,. . .}
<A>__{later they're lying on a chaise in erica's room, making out. a cell phone rings. they both look around for it. erica reaches for it on her desk.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(disoriented)}
<D>__{hello? i mean...hello.}
<P>__{(turns phone upside down)}
<D>__{hello.}
