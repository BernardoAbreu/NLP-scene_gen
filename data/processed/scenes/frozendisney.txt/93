<L>__{interior library night}
<A>__{anna shivers by the door. she looks up to see ice overtaking the ceiling. the door handle suddenly jiggles. stops. jiggles again.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(barely a whisper)}
<D>__{help.}
<A>__{click. the door swings open. we see a carrot in the lock and hear a giggle of victory. olaf takes the carrot, puts it back on his face. then he sees anna lying there.}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{anna. oh no.}
<A>__{he runs to the fireplace. throws in some fresh wood, including one of his own arms, which he quickly rescues, before striking a match and relighting the fire.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{olaf? olaf. get away from there.}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{whoa! so this is heat....}
<P>__{(considering)}
<D>__{i love it.}
<A>__{he reaches a twig finger toward the flames. it catches on fire.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{ooh! but don't touch it!}
<A>__{he shakes the flame out, as he rushes over to help anna to the fire.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{so, where's hans? what happened to your kiss?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i was wrong about him. it wasn't true love.}
<C>__{olaf}
<P>__{(confused innocence)}
<D>__{huh. but we ran all the way here?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{please olaf, you can't stay here; you'll melt.}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{i am not leaving here until we find some other act of true love to save you.}
<A>__{he sits down behind her, stubbornly. leans his back against hers and thinks.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{...do you happen to have any ideas?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i don't even know what love is.}
<C>__{olaf}
<P>__{(confident)}
<D>__{that's okay, i do....}
<A>__{olaf hops back up and puts a soothing hand on her shoulder.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{love is...putting someone else's needs before yours, like, you know, how kristoff brought you back here to hans and left you forever.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{...kristoff loves me?}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{wow, you really don't know anything about love, do you?}
<A>__{his face starts to melt.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{olaf, you're melting.}
<C>__{olaf}
<P>__{(sweet and reassuring)}
<D>__{some people are worth melting for.}
<A>__{but then...his face really melts. he panics, pushes the snow back in place.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{just maybe not right this second.}
<A>__{suddenly, the window blows open, cold wind sweeps in.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{don't worry, i've got it!}
<A>__{olaf flitters to the window. he pulls one panel of it shut but struggles with the second panel.}
<C>__{olaf }
<P>__{(determined)}
<D>__{we're going to get through }
<P>__{(distracted)}
<D>__{oh, wait. hang on. i'm getting something.}
<A>__{he breaks an icicle off the window, uses it as a telescope and sees... kristoff and sven running back down the mountain.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{it's kristoff and sven! they're coming back this way.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{...they they are?}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{wow, he's really moving fast. huh.... i guess i was wrong. i guess kristoff doesn't love you enough to leave you behind.}
<A>__{anna tries to get to her feet.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{help me up, olaf. please.}
<A>__{he hurries over, tumbling over the couch, knocking over the chess set and water jugs.}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{no, no, no, no, no. you need to stay by the fire and keep warm.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i need to get to kristoff.}
<C>__{olaf}
<P>__{(clueless)}
<D>__{why...?}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{oh, oh, oh, i know why.}
<A>__{he hops around in an excited display of hope.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{there's your act of true love, right there, riding across the fjords like a valiant, pungent reindeer king! come on!}
<A>__{the walls crack under the ice pressure.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{look out!}
<A>__{they rush out the room just as the ceiling collapses.}
