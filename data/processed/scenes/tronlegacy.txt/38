<L>__{exterior hub city}
<A>__{electro pop overload. rush and mega squeeze through crowds, past screaming data pipes and sizzling circuitry. city is dominated by mugshots of tron: "enemy of the future" mega locates a gleaming x net kiosk. a promoter (krod) extoles the virtues of the x net system:}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{three more hub cities have been attacked by viruses!}
<P>__{(crowd gets scared)}
<D>__{but x net opens soon! you will travel in total security!}
<A>__{crowd buzzes. they can't wait.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{this is the one you seek?}
<A>__{rush approaches krod. looks like miles rabbish. there's a bizarre moment of recognition between them.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{it's gotta be }
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{krod!}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{krod!}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{yeah, yeah heeey!}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{the best pattern recognition program ever.}
<P>__{(to mega)}
<D>__{this guy can filter a river of junk data and pull out the good stuff.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{you know it, dude!}
<A>__{krod smiles big at mega, refers to rush:}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{who is this guy?}
<A>__{rush pulls krod aside.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{miles i mean krod, you flew the search engine. you ran a trace on a hotshot lightcycle rider. the red guy. remember?}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{well. eh. i'd like to help you, but truth is, i just got rebooted from a big crash. there's nothing left in my memory from before.}
<A>__{he taps his head.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{this will yield zero.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{hang on.}
<A>__{rush thinks, touches a surface. concentrates. circuitry zaps from data coming off his hands. connections illuminate, data races around walls and floors. programs stop what they're doing, amazed by the feat. mega is astonished and privately worried. rush's data flow illuminates surfaces with images from his memory the opening light cycle race.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{remember, krod? you were watching this lightcycle duel, a red guy and a green guy, head to head.}
<A>__{krod gawks at the image, but he's stumped.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{the green guy faked out the red guy, but the red guy double faked the green guy.}
<A>__{bingo.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{okay! yes! and the green guy splattered big time! it was awesome! how could i forget that?!}
<A>__{splat happens in rush's memory image. all goes white.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{where did the red guy go after that? you didn't crash right away.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{he escaped out this hidden exit }
<A>__{krod's points to another screen. "wanted" image of tron.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{that guy! the red guy!}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{did you jack his coordinate?}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{tr165444.018!}
<A>__{they slap high fives. krod double takes on rush.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{and the green guy was you! you got rebooted?! they called you, um don't tell me, i got it, eh }
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{call me rush.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{yeah! whatever. you're good. how'd you do that thing with your hands?}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{it's complicated. you're coming with us to the old game grid. we're going to find tron and shut him down.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{beats working.}
<A>__{they head out. krod falls in beside mega, impressed by her.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{hey babe. did i ever know you?}
