<L>__{exterior crater caves future}
<A>__{penny pushes through dwindling brush to a series of rocky overhangs and caverns cut into the crater wall. blip is standing over a large circular stone, hopping up and down, chirping and blipping madly.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{blip, you can't run off like that.}
<A>__{(closing on the stone)}
<D>__{what the ?}
<A>__{the stone close. a series of hieroglyphs are painted on the giant rock, their images the same style as those on the probe ship. hieroglyph one close. a mighty battle in space is depicted.}
<C>__{penny }
<D>__{some kind of fight, in space. it almost looks like the probe ship major west blew up.}
<A>__{hieroglyph two close. a fiery star falls to the planet's surface.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{that could be the jupiter two crash landing.}
<A>__{hieroglyph three close. here a dark haired beauty holds a single lizard monkey aloft, her face remarkably like penny's. suddenly blip begins to shriek. (over) rustling leaves. shapes are moving in the trees, the vague outline of camouflaged forms dropping to the ground. five figures suddenly de camouflage. lizard monkeys, two large, two smaller. directly in front of penny, the largest monkey de camouflages. fully grown, the beast is nearly twice penny's height. around the creature's wrist is something odd. an old, tattered green ribbon. blip begins to scream and shriek.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{blip, no!}
<A>__{too late. blip leaps on the giant creature, grabs the ribbon. the beast could slap blip away like a fly. but the creature doesn't resist, just stares down at blip with something akin to tenderness. blip looks at the ribbon in his hand. then at the one around her wrist. save for their age difference., the ribbons are identical. the giant monkey moves forward, closing on a petrified penny, paw reaching out, touching her face. the beast begins stroking penny's cheek in a familiar gesture of comfort.}
<C>__{giant blip}
<D>__{nice girl. pretty girl. nice.}
<A>__{penny stares up in stunned wonder.}
