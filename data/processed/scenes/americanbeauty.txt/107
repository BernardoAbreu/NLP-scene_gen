<A>__{carolyn's pov: we turn into the burnham driveway. a 1970 pontiac firebird with racing stripes blocks our access to the garage. close on carolyn: she doesn't like having things in her way.}
<L>__{interior burnham house family room moments later}
<A>__{lester's remote controlled model jeep is zooming across the floor of the family room, expertly maneuvering corners and narrowly avoiding crashing. lester is sprawled on the couch in his underwear, drinking a beer and controlling the car. his working out is beginning to produce results. the room, too, seems changed: sloppier, more lived in. carolyn enters through the kitchen, flushed and angry. she just stands there, staring at lester. after a moment, he looks up at her.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{carolyn}
<D>__{ah, whose car is that out front?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{mine. 1970 pontiac firebird. the car i always wanted and now i have it. i rule!}
<C>__{carolyn}
<D>__{where's the camry?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i traded it in.}
<C>__{carolyn}
<D>__{shouldn't you have consulted me first?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{hmm, let me think... no. you never drove it.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{have you done something different? you look great.}
<C>__{carolyn}
<P>__{(brusque)}
<D>__{where's jane?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{jane not home. we have the whole house to ourselves.}
<A>__{he smiles at her playfully. she stares back, annoyed. it's the same look she had at the beginning, when he dropped his briefcase, but whatever power that look had is gone. lester just laughs.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{christ, carolyn. when did you become so... joyless?}
<C>__{carolyn}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{joyless?! i am not joyless! there happens to be a lot about me that you don't know, mister smarty man. there is plenty of joy in my life.}
<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(leaning toward her)}
<D>__{whatever happened to that girl who used to fake seizures at frat parties when she got bored? and who used to run up to the roof of our first apartment building to flash the traffic helicopters? have you totally forgotten about her? because i haven't.}
<A>__{his face is close to hers, and suddenly the atmosphere is charged. she pulls back automatically, but it's clear she's drawn to him. he smiles, and moves even closer, holding his beer loosely balanced. then, just before their lips meet...}
<C>__{carolyn}
<P>__{(barely audible)}
<D>__{lester. you're going to spill beer on the couch.}
<A>__{she's immediately sorry she said it, but it's too late. his smile fades, and the moment is gone.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{so what? it's just a couch.}
<C>__{carolyn}
<D>__{this is a four thousand dollar sofa upholstered in italian silk. this is not "just a couch."}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{it's just a couch!}
<A>__{he stands and gestures toward all the things in the room.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{this isn't life. this is just stuff. and it's become more important to you than living. well, honey, that's just nuts.}
<A>__{carolyn stares at him, on the verge of tears, then turns and walks out of the room before he can see her cry.}
<C>__{lester }
<P>__{(calls after her)}
<D>__{i'm only trying to help you.}
