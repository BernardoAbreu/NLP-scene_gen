<L>__{interior dwight's living room day}
<A>__{tarpaulins are everywhere. toby stands surrounded by seven five gallon cans of painterior carrying paintbrushes, dwight enters, dressed in old clothes singing "in the still of the night."}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{now that's a song. not all this elvis presley shit. elvis sings about like i do brain surgery.}
<A>__{he imitates elvis moves his hips slightly and sings a few notes:}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{'... uh huh huh, my blue suede shoes.'}
<A>__{dwight gives toby a flash of his teeth and toby smiles back.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{let's get this place ready for caroline.}
<A>__{they begin painting. after only a few strokes, though, toby looks doubtful.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{it's so white.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{i got a good deal on this painterior}
<P>__{(stands back; appraises)}
<D>__{it'll darken up when it dries.}
<A>__{same scene later the walls and ceiling are almost finished, but the paint has not darkened. as he paints, he absentmindedly sings "blue suede shoes." then he stops painting, as he notices toby looking at the walls.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{what? i like it. it looks clean.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yeah, but it makes everything else look so dark.}
<A>__{dwight's face changes. he has an idea.}
<B>__{montage}
<A>__{a) same scene later}
<D>__{on the soundtrack, elvis blasts out "blue suede shoes." dwight and toby paint the coffee table and lamp base white.}
<A>__{b) same scene later}
<D>__{dwight and toby, working faster, are painting the end tables white.}
<A>__{c) interior dining room later}
<D>__{the walls and ceiling are white, dwight and toby are painting the dining table white.}
<A>__{d) e) interior kitchen late night dwight and toby are painting the cabinets and kitchen table white. f) interior living room next morning everywhere we look is white, the walls, ceiling, furniture all of it. only the old baldwin upright piano has escaped painting. dwight eyes it suspiciously.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{sort of stands out, doesn't it?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yeah, you could say that.}
<A>__{g) same scene later they paint the baldwin white. dwight hesitates, then starts to paint the foot pedals. h) same scene later dwight's face tells us that something still doesn't suit him. he glances at toby, toby nods, and they converge on the piano. j) same scene later very carefully, dwight and toby finish painting the dark ivory keys to match the rest of the room. elvis screams out the last line, "you can do anything, but stay off of my blue suede shoes!" they stand up, look around arctic white is every where. dwight likes it. toby is less sure. the montage ends.}
