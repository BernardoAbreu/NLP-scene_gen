<A>__{a security guard opens the front door, pokes his head into the offices.}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{mr. bridger?}
<A>__{no answer. the guard nods, backs out of the offices, locking them with sarah and the killer inside!}

<L>__{interior prop room night}
<A>__{sarah's waiting on eggs as a digitized pre programmed commissarymenu for sunrise studios drags out.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{sarah momentarily glances behind her, just noticing, a pair of black work boots stepping off the costume rack. before sarah has a chance to scream, the ghost jumps down and shoves the rack hard sending a screaming sarah into the next room. she goes flying out, slamming into a metal table covered with prop weapons. the ghost stomps into the second prop room, knife raised. sarah leaps up, starts to chuck the prop knives at her attacker, screaming furiously. the prop knives, hit the ghost, and bend as they bounce off his body and onto the floor. the killer shakes his head angrily, stalks towards his prey.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{no! no! noooo!}
<A>__{the ghost drives his knife into sarah's chest, once, twice, and delivers a final killing blow to her adam's apple. she staggers forward. her killer grabs her by her long buxom hair, and hucks her into a glass door. the door explodes, sarah's body falling through, shards of glass tearing out her back. the killer, stands in the shattered doorway, bloody knife in hand. an alarm resonates in the b.g. the killer wipes his knife clean, races off screen. a nice psycho esque close up of the dead sarah's eye as blood swirls into the pupil.}
