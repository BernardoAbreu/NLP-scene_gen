<A>__{stephenson, a three car luxury bullet train speeds along a snow covered mountain in the dead of night, its halogen headlight cutting through the darkness. it dips into a tunnel }
<C>__{mater }
<D>__{boy, i will tell you what. that three wheeled feller had to be right about a big meeting.}
<L>__{interior spy car moving night}
<A>__{mater, finn and holley scroll through surveillance style photos of traffic on an italian street. they're in the front train car, which doubles as a luxury seating area and intelligence command center.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{you never see this many lemons in one town. unless there's a swap meet, or something.}
<P>__{(to holley) (more)}
<C>__{mater }
<D>__{hey, how'd you get all them pictures?}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{well, i remotely reprogrammed porto corsa's red light cameras to do recognition scans.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{wow, not only is you the prettiest car i ever met, but you the smartest too.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{thank you. i think.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{that's a familiar sight.}
<A>__{mater refers to a photo of victor hugo, the hugo lemonhead, being towed by an eastern european tow truck.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{a hugo being towed. but he looks absolutely perfect.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{of course. they must be the heads of the lemon families.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{makes sense. if i was rich and broke down every day, i'd hire me to tow me around all the time too.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{we've got to infiltrate that meeting. it's the only way to find out who's behind all this.}
<C>__{holley}
<P>__{(eyeing mater)}
<D>__{hang on a minute.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{hold still.}
<A>__{holley snaps mater's picture, temporarily blinding him.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{ahh!}
<A>__{holley turns back to her monitor. mater's face appears on screen. she quickly grafts it over the hugo's tow truck's.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{good job, miss shiftwell.}
<A>__{holley isn't sure what surprises her more: the compliment or how pleased it makes her.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{thank you, finn.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{boy, i sure wish my friends could see me now.}
