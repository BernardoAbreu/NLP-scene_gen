<L>__{exterior mars surface night}
<A>__{dead quiet. the two small moons shine faintly. a rime of ice covers everything. the hillock shimmers in the feeble light. the rock entrance is sealed over with frost.}
<L>__{interior cave night}
<A>__{gallagher and burchenal breathe shallowly. the inside of the cave is covered in white flaking hoarfrost. lips are blue. skin is pale. gallagher's eyes open. something's wrong. doesn't know what. and then he realizes the air moving in and out of his lungs isn't doing him any good at all. the door is caked shut with ice. there's no air. he moves badly, uncoordinated, but manages to chop and shove it open. fresh ice cold air rushes in. burchenal awakes. only half responsive. gallagher grabs him, drags him out.}
