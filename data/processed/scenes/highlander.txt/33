<A>__{dr. kidell stands at his bookcase leafing through a binder.}
<C>__{kidell}
<D>__{1945, that strains the memory.}
<P>__{(after a fashion)}
<D>__{here we are, richard taupin.}
<A>__{he carries the binder to the table where brenna sits.}
<C>__{kidell}
<D>__{would you like more tea?}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{no thank you, i'm fine.}
<A>__{kidell sips his own and looks over the binder page.}
<C>__{kidell}
<D>__{he was unsual.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{kidell}
<D>__{well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then. most all the babies i delivered were from local families. richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came. i did it right here at the house.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{then you didn't know richard later on.}
<C>__{kidell}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{i've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.}
<C>__{kidell}
<D>__{don't know about any of that. suppose nobody does.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{i don't follow you.}
<C>__{kidell}
<D>__{poor little tyke didn't have a chance. hopelessly premature. he died a few days after he was born.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{the boy _died_?}
<C>__{kidell}
<D>__{mother too. sad case it was. the young lady just couldn't make it through labor. never even saw her son.}
<A>__{dr. kidell removes from the binder a tattered newspaper clipping.}
<C>__{kidell}
<D>__{my brother worked for the town paper at the time. he took this picture of the funeral.}
<A>__{something in the clipping sparks brenna's interest.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{have you spoken to anyone else about this?}
<C>__{kidell}
<D>__{there was this one fella. asked a lot of questions. i was out of town but i heard he spent near a full day in the records office.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{would you remember his name?}
<C>__{kidell}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{carl smith.}
