<L>__{interior red maple hostess stand}
<A>__{gigi enters slowly, looking around, searching for conor. she tries to move toward the bar as she's met by kelli ann, who grabs a few menus and slaps on a smile.}

<C>__{kelli ann}
<D>__{nothing. sorry. for dinner?}
<A>__{gigi continues to scan the place, not paying attention.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{i'm meeting someone.}
<C>__{kelli ann}
<D>__{i believe you mentioned that.}
<A>__{gigi finishes her visual tour of the room no conor.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{i'm gonna wait at the bar.}
<C>__{kelli ann}
<D>__{that's a great idea.}
<A>__{gigi walks off. kelli ann takes her place behind the hostess stand.}
<B>__{at the bar}
<A>__{gigi grabs a stool with a good view of the door. alex, now behind the bar, approaches.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{what can i get you?}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{oh, that's ok. i'm meeting someone.}
<A>__{alex takes her in. she's clearly nervous.}

<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{oh, uhh, yeah }
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{conor's not coming in tonight. did he forget he was supposed to meet you?}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{see when i said "meeting someone" i guess that was kind of a broad term, kind of a wide interpretation of the word "meeting" }
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{because i could just call him }
<A>__{alex reaches for the phone.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{no! i mean, totally unnecessary. i mean, i actually was just in the area so i figured i'd just swing by and see if he was around because uhhh }
<A>__{alex waits, looking at gigi, amused. she is panicking.}
<C>__{gigi }
<D>__{i uhh, had to return his }
<A>__{gigi frantically searches her coat pockets searching for something, anything and finally fishes out a pen. she looks at it and decides to go with it.}
<C>__{gigi }
<D>__{pen. i had to return this pen. he left this. so, i thought i should really return it before he you know }
<P>__{(conspiratorially to alex)}
<D>__{ freaks out.}
<A>__{alex looks at her skeptically. and then takes the pen, and inspects it.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{dr. frankel adult, child and geriatric dentistry.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{look, i'm not gonna judge about what may or may not be important to someone.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{that's not even his dentist.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{oh, really? then who's his dentist?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{my dad.}
<A>__{gigi looks at alex for a long moment, and finally folds.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{i'm gigi. conor and i went out last week. and i just...i thought if i ran into him...i don't know. i'm gonna go.}
<A>__{gigi struggles to get out quickly. alex looks at her holding her pen, looking quite frazzled and softens.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{hey. just hang out for a second. lemme buy you a drink.}
<A>__{gigi smiles and sits back down.}
