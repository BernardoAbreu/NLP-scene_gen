<L>__{interior county jail interview room day}
<A>__{wire mesh separates frank from his battalion of lawyers. he glances over them to richie being led through the large visiting room.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{here he is, let me talk to him alone.}
<A>__{the attorneys get up and leave. richie takes their place. frank regards him a moment, offering the same knowing smile from the courtroom. richie offers nothing.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i just heard something. i said it couldn't be true. you didn't really turn in a million dollars you found in the trunk of a car, did you?}
<A>__{richie doesn't say. frank searches his face for some clue to where on earth he's from.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{want me to tell you what happened to it? it ended up in cops' pockets.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{maybe? no. it did. all you did was give it to them for nothing in return. not nothing: you got their contempt.}
<A>__{frank studies him.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{why'd you do that? what're you trying to prove, you're better than them? you're not better than them. you are them.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{i don't have the time or interest to listen to (this) }
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you did it because it was right. that's all. why's that hard to say? the question is would you do it again? that was a long time ago. it'd be very easy to find out. tell me you want to find out, tell me the address, and a car will be there, the trunk loaded.}
<A>__{richie knows frank isn't kidding ...}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{no, thanks.}
<A>__{frank suddenly explodes }
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{who the fuck are you to say no to that? you think that impresses me?}
<A>__{guards look over, then glance away once it's clear the outburst is through. richie remains serene. eventually }
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{let me ask you something. you think by putting me in jail, you're going to stop even one junkie from dying? because you won't. if it isn't me, it'll be someone else. with me or without me, nothing's going to change.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{then that's the way it is.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you have any sort of case? or just that idiot drives for my brother. is he your case? because if it's just him and the powder, it's not enough.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{then you got nothing to worry about.}
<A>__{but frank is worried, most of all by this cop who doesn't take money sitting placidly in front of him.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{my brothers won't talk to you. my cousins. none of my family. no one but that mother fucking driver.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{i got more than that. i got a line of people wanting to testify that stretches out the door and around the block.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{bullshit.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{is it? tony the bug. benny two socks. carmine camanetti.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{who the fuck are they? i don't know them and they don't know me.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{they sell dope for the mazzano crime family. which you all but put out of business.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{this is who you're going to put on the stand? guys who don't know me? who got nothing to do with me?}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{they have everything to do with you. and the only thing they hate more than you is what you represent.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i don't represent nothing.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{you don't? black businessman like you? of course you do. but once you're gone, things can return to normal.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{look at me. you looking? can you tell by looking it would mean nothing to me if tomorrow you turned up dead?}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{get in line. that one stretches around the block, too.}
<A>__{frank has never been so frustrated by anyone in his life. he wants to work something out with richie obviously, but he can't figure out how. frank studies him.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what can we do?}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{you know what you have to do.}
<A>__{frank does, but doesn't like it, and doesn't know if he can do it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i could give you cops, but that's not who you want, is it. you want organized crime names.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{i will take them, too. i want them all.}
<A>__{frank isn't sure he heard right.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you'll take them, too? you'd go after cops? are you serious? you'd do that? lock up your own kind?}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{they're not. not the ones in business with you. they're not my kind any more than the italians are yours.}
<A>__{they regard one another in silence. richie can tell frank sees daylight.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what can you promise me?}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{i can promise you if you lie to me about one name, you'll never get out of prison. lie about one dollar in one offshore account, you'll never get out. you can live rich in jail the rest of your life, or poor outside it, that's what i can promise.}
<A>__{frank is silent for several moments. finally }
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you know, i don't care if the feds take all my buildings, my stocks, my off shore accounts. they can take it all, i don't care use it to build battleships, paint bridges, whatever the fuck they want. fight another war. but those other motherfuckers the cops put my money in their pockets. millions.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{i believe it.}
<A>__{frank debates with himself the step he's about to take ...}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{i want to know everyone you've met for the last twenty years. everyone you sold to. every cop you ever paid off. every one who ever stole from you. every one you remember.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{oh, i remember them all. that's not the problem.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{what is?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{the jail's aren't big enough.}
