<B>__{bad day at black rock}
<A>__{establishing shot black rock part of town: focal point:}
<B>__{railroad station}
<A>__{abandoned, in an extreme state of dilapidation. the structure is blistered by the resolute sun, the roof is weather warped. dry rot and mildew wage a relentless battle against the foundation. between the building and the tracks is a long, somewhat narrow platform, its floorboards twisted by time, termites and the elements. the match board overhang of the building, throwing some little shade to a portion of the platform, sags and bellies. from the overhang is appended a rectangular panel on which, in flaky paint, the town is identified:}
<B>__{black rock}
<A>__{one of the broken wires holding the panel is longer than the other, cocking the sign irregularly. the railroad tracks reach endlessly into the horizon. past the town on each side stretches the ocean like prairie, with sand dunes rising and falling monotonously, shouldering each other toward infinity. the morning sun lays over this wasteland of the american southwest, a gigantic yellow bruise from which heat waves like bloodshot arteries spread themselves over the poisoned sky. a small shack stands next to the station, separated from it by a narrow alleyway and leaning toward the larger building, as if for support. the words postal telegraph are arced across its dusty vitrine. an old straight backed chair, reinforced with twisted wire, is tilted against the north west corner of the shack. in it is mr. hastings, the postal telegraph agent, a man of middle years and exorbitant mediocrity. he sits there spinelessly, fingering a wart on his receding chin and, once in a while, for variety, rubbing a knuckle under his watery nose. full shot black rock the town is minute, dismal and forgotten, crouching in isolation where the single line of railroad track intersects a secondary dirt road. the twin strips of steel glisten in the fierce sunlight, fencing the dreary plain from the false fronts of the town. in b.g. is the bluff of a black stony mountain. against this ancient mass the houses of black rock's single street (see map, p.2a) are scanty in number and insignificant in architecture, a conglomerate paint peeled modern trussed together with rusty nails and battered tin strips torn from signs. the town and the terrain surrounding it have, if nothing else, the quality of inertia and immutibility nothing moves, not even an insect; nothing breathes, not even the wind. town and terrain seem to be trapped, caught and held forever in the sullen, abrasive earth.}

<A>__{sequence from original script. straight shot streamliner jarring in its power as it ramrods across the desert, its diesel engines pounding. its horn "wonks" twice, blasting the shatterable air. full shot black rock another angle nothing is changed, nothing is altered. but look close and you will see a small shallow current of wind sweeping lazily across the dirt and dust of the single street. hold for a beat, then main title appears. between the ensuing credits}
<L>__{intercut :}
<A>__{a series of sharp long shots. the composition of each shot has that hard, sun beaten texture of american primitive painting pressurized in its simplicity best exemplified, perhaps, by the work of grant wood.}
<L>__{exterior sam's sanitary bar and grill angle on doc velie}
<A>__{assayer and notary public, mortician to the citizens of black rock who have departed to a better place, and veterinarian to its lesser animals. an elderly, somewhat untidy gentleman, he sits nonchalantly on a chair outside the bar & grill. idling with him are three or four other loafers, among them sam, the middle aged proprietor of the restaurant. doc glances casually at his watch; no one else moves. the hot wind continues listlessly down the empty street.}

<A>__{a tall, attractive girl of twenty in dungarees and cotton shirt. she stands just outside the open barn like door of the garage, staring, from the compulsive force of habit, at the endlessly receding tracks. the sultry wind, its gustiness slightly increased, blows through her fine dark hair.}

<A>__{two enormous men. hector is tall, and there is about him a nasty, raw boned tautness; coley is more the anthropoid type long thick arms and a round, iron casing of a belly. they glance down the street, watching incuriously a dust devil swirling in the wind. now the camera has completed its probe of the town and its denizens. main title and credits are completed... close shot mr. hastings still spineless in his chair, the chair still tilted against the shack. from o.s. and far away, we hear the horn of the streamliner two long "wonks", a short and a long (engine whistle signal for approach to bridge crossing). hastings straightens up ever so slightly as he reacts to the oncoming train. straight shot streamliner moving at tremendous speed.}

<D>__{stopping...?}
<A>__{shot train heading toward camera, churning across the desert like a juggernaut. it pans past camera in a blur of speed. camera swings up on a level with the great iron wheels as the brakes are applied. the wheels shriek agonizingly against the rails, kicking up cinders and a wild flurry of dust. she cuts speed, brakes hissing, and starts to slow down. long shot main street black rock shooting from rear of town, toward the railroad tracks. the townspeople step out, frowning, cautious, disturbed. the secure ritual of the train passing through, never stopping, has somehow, for some unknown reason, been violated. close shot doc velie as his mouth tightens. his air of placidity vanishes, leaving his features disturbed. close shot liz brooks her fine young face stiffens almost imperceptibly. her eyes are coated with a vague emptiness. she seems confused as she halfturns toward the hotel. reverse shot what she sees coley trimble and hector david, standing on the porch of the hotel. they seem tense, responding variously to what might be fear. coley's nostrils flare, his flat ugly mouth compresses. he looks profoundly serious. hector wipes a glob of dusty sweat from the socket of an eye and blinks rapidly. close shot hastings as he stands in surprise, nervously alert, watching the train as it comes to a complete stop. his jaw droops with the slackness of fear.}

<L>__{exterior station platform}
<A>__{with the train stationary before it. a sleek steel door of a pullman clangs open. a colored porter carrying a suitcase walks down the wrought iron steps. he is stately, gray haired and lean, with the almost finical tidiness travelers associate with trainmen. the man behind him is big shouldered, a granite like wedge of a man with calm, piercing eyes. there is about him an air of monumental dependability and quiet humor, but his eyes are those of a man who has lately lived in somber familiarity with pain. his left arm hangs from his shoulder with that lifeless rigidity of paralysis, while the hand is hidden in his pocket. another angle macreedy and porter the porter puts the suitcase on the platform. in the distance the town and its people are seen staring silently, motionlessly. the big man glances toward them. he smiles a sad, distasteful greeting to the town, its wretched dust. its mean, modest buildings. the porter disappears into the train as the conductor enters scene. he turns slowly, following macreedy's gaze...}

<A>__{macreedy nods his thanks. the conductor signals the engineer (o.s.) and steps on the train. the diesel's claxon blasts the torrid air ominously. the train slowly, smoothly, begins to move, picking up speed. the cars slip past until, quite suddenly, the streamliner is gone. for a moment macreedy watches it. then, quite unconsciously, he takes a package of cigarettes from his left hand pocket, taps the last one free of the pack, sticks it between his lips and, crumpling the empty pack, drops it beside the tracks. he takes a cardboard book of matches, flicks it open, bends a match in half with agile fingers, and with a sure frictional motion scrapes the head against the sandpaper guard. the match flares, the cigarette is lit. macreedy inhales, exhales deeply, and turns to pick up his suitcase. then he sees hastings, who walks slowly, almost painfully, to him. his adam's apple grapples protestingly with his collar. after a moment he controls it sufficiently to talk...}

<A>__{sequence from original script. close angle on macreedy as he walks along. he feels the eyes of everyone following him, glaring at him. he halts, looks around. the townspeople continue to eye him brazenly, yet with an almost animal incuriosity. he grins and walks on past a cluster of five or six rfd mail boxes and a road sign [1], its paint peeling, its face punctured by three or four bullets from a drunk's pistol long ago. shot macreedy heading toward the hotel. in b.g. is a relatively small farm equipment yard compressed between a general store (which macreedy has just passed) and the hotel just ahead. in the yard are a few tractors, and among them huddles a tiny office. it is empty; the front window is thick with dust. on it, etched by an anonymous, childish finger, is a skull and crossbones. running diagonally across is the printed legend:}
<B>__{t.j. hates j.s.}
<A>__{macreedy notes the inscription with a sort of wry bemusement. he walks on, reaching the facade of the weather beaten hotel. a gust of wind swirls down the street, momentarily engulfing macreedy and the entire area in a sudden eddying whirlpool. as it subsides... another angle macreedy as he peers through the dust toward the dingy hotel. it has a narrow stoop and outsize bay windows on each side. macreedy mounts the hotel steps. at the top of the steps coley trimble and hector david watch him silently. hector is large and leanly muscular, yet coley looms over him like a battleship. he is a gross behemoth of a man, with sharp flinty eyes the size of glistening pinpoints and a slack, oversized jaw. both men wear modern western work clothes, but there is one incongruous accessory which hector affects. around his thick wrist is a watch with a large flat face and an elaborately tooled leather strap a cheap reproduction of one of those expensive swiss timepieces which, among many distinguished accomplishments, tells the day of the week, the month of the year, the phase of the moon, etc., etc.}

<A>__{it is a typical small town hotel, but crummier, with a tiny lobby. macreedy is waiting at the empty desk as hector strolls in, flopping his enormous bulk into a nicked and mothy chair. he picks up a newspaper, but his eyes remain on macreedy. macreedy waits patiently for the absent clerk. for a moment, he studies the open registration ledger; his eyes rove from the ink splotched blotter up over the desk to one of those world war ii banners, the imitation silk now stained and faded. it depicts a shrieking eagle rampant, clutching the flag in a claw. under it, the legend:}

<D>__{now why ever would he want to do that?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe he figures, needle me enough and i will crack. maybe i will even fight back. then he or hector your other ape would beat me to death and cop a plea of self defense.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{i don't think that'll be necessary. you're so scared now you'll probably drown in your own sweat.}
<C>__{coley}
<D>__{before that happens, couldn't i pick a fight with you if i tied one hand behind me...?}
<A>__{macreedy rises to go out. as he passes coley, coley takes his limp left arm and spins him slowly but firmly around. the two men face each other.}
<C>__{coley}
<D>__{if i tied both hands...?}
<A>__{macreedy shakes free of coley's grasp. coley lunges. his big right fist streaks toward macreedy's face. macreedy ducks, weaving with the punch. he grabs coley's belt, twisting coley's body. the momentum of the swing throws coley off balance. as he goes past macreedy, the stranger tugs at his belt, twisting him to one side. he plants his left foot firmly on the toes of coley's left boot, for a split second anchoring coley in place. he chops the under side of his open hand in a short, vicious arc that lands solidly under coley's ear. with the same motion, he brings the heel of his hand hard against and slightly under the tip of coley's nose. the cartilage shatters. blood spills down his face. following through, macreedy's elbow smashes beneath coley's cheekbone. macreedy's arm goes past the astonished, wind burned face, finding coley's right wrist. he jerks the wrist out and backward. it snaps. coley whimpers, his face twisted in pain and perplexity. his body lolls forward. macreedy steps back. he raises his right shoulder a few inches. his bent right arm drives up like a piston attached to the shoulder's lift. fist and arm seem all one rigid piece with only the limber shoulder giving them motion. the fist strikes coley's face, covering for a moment one side of his chin and a corner of his mouth between cheekbone and jawbone. coley shuts his eyes and falls unconscious. smith, a puzzled expression on his face, watches coley fall. he takes half a step toward him. macreedy looks at smith. smith stops. macreedy's face is wooden, with a trace of sullenness around the hard lines of his mouth. working methodically, macreedy frisks coley. he takes from a pocket a long, ugly knife. he snaps the spring and the four inch blade leaps into place. he looks at the knife in his hand and then at smith. he smiles gently, even dreamily.}

<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{and they're getting tougher every minute.}
<A>__{he walks past smith and goes out the door. self consciously holding the knife, smith turns to face the loafers at the bar. they say nothing; they stare at him, through him, like a panel of ghouls. the door opens, admitting sam and doc, who carries his little black medical bag. doc looks at coley.}

<D>__{come on, hector.}
<A>__{he walks out, the new sheriff strutting beside him, with hastings in their wake. for a moment macreedy, doc and tim stand in the center of the lobby. pete eyes them non committally and goes back to his solitaire. he glances up now and then, moving the cards with a purposeful sort of slowness, as of a more natural swiftness restrained by his preoccupation with the three men in the lobby. macreedy is deep in thought. abstractedly he tugs at his collar and then repeats the ritual of lighting a cigarette. tim's shoulders are slumped. humiliation has corroded him, flesh and soul. even doc is momentarily subdued; he too, feels degraded, unclean. macreedy looks from one to the other of the good, ineffectual companions that circumstance has so haphazardly tossed his way. he takes a few steps to his suitcase, doc and tim trailing him; doc, for want of something better to do; tim, out of his deep, inexpressible need for support. macreedy takes an untapped bottle of whiskey from his bag. he thumbs the cork loose and holds the bottle out to tim. tim takes a drink. the light on the clerk's desk goes on, and we are aware that day has gone and that night is falling. the pressing, fierce light has drained from the lobby, leaving a shadowy, silvery dreariness. the shadows have lengthened and the silver has tarnished with the darkness.}

<D>__{and all the useful men are on the other side.}

<A>__{pete and doc are nervously alert, drained of energy, waiting. hector is downright bored. he toys with his pistol, squinting at it, twirling the barrel. finding neither interest nor pleasure in the piece, he jams it back in his holster and strolls with exaggerated surety out on the porch.}
<L>__{exterior porch night}
<A>__{the congregation of loafers look up as hector emerges. imbued with his own bullying importance, he draws the pistol, maneuvers an extravagant pinwheel and a few other gaudy tricks. then he sighs as boredom again takes over. he walks down the steps to catch a bit of air.}

<A>__{the disappearance of hector (o.s.) down the street galvanizes them into action. they hurry out of the lobby toward the back of the hotel.}
<L>__{exterior alley behind hotel night}
<A>__{vague in the pallid light escaping through a few back windows. the hotel's rear door is tightly shut. around the far corner of the street (extreme b.g.) comes the gangling body of hector david. he walks toward camera. perhaps twenty five yards away he stops to rest against a fence like a leaning tower. close shot hector his hand goes to a pocket and comes out with a crumpled half pack of cigarettes. suddenly the movement is arrested; something at the other end of the street captures his bleak attention.}
<B>__{what he sees}
<A>__{a jeep, headlights off, slowly turns the corner, pulls up to the curb and parks. back to scene hector pockets his cigarettes and starts slowly for the jeep, a quizzical frown on his horsy face. he approaches the back door of the hotel, oblivious to it as he continues toward the jeep.}
<L>__{interior rear hallway of hotel night}
<A>__{at the far end b.g., toward the lobby, a single unshaded light bulb burns dully. a slight figure stands in f.g. to one side is a narrow u shaped alcove blanketed in heavy shadows. the features of the man in the hall and the slim lines of his body blend vaguely in the darkness. with enormous care, he turns a knob and opens the door leading to the alley behind the hotel. light thrown by the back windows reveals that the figure is pete. the same pallid light from the alley, glancing across the alcove, momentarily illuminates it. glued as close to the recessed wall as is humanly possible is doc. he is partially shielded by one of those hotel hose wheels around which an old fire hose is wound. the heavy brass nozzle of the hose hangs from the end. doc grips a twelve inch length of lead pipe. pete swallows nervously and peers outside, first to the right, then to the left. his eyes glaze with fear, and his jaw tightens with tension.}

<A>__{as hector enters and stops. pete quickly closes the door behind him and walks toward the lobby, attempting to draw hector toward the black alcove center screen b.g. but hector is not to be sucked in. he glares at pete, waiting. (note: the following dialogue is delivered sotto voce.)}

<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you got a match?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{come on. i got some in the lobby.}
<A>__{he starts to turn. hector's pig eyes are slits of suspicion. before pete can move, hector reaches out, hooking two heavy fingers inside a pocket of pete's shirt. slowly hector's expression changes to one of insidious cunning. his fingers come out of pete's pocket, and between them is a paper book of matches.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i thought you didn't have a match.}
<A>__{pete is unable to answer. he is scared to death.}
<L>__{interior alcove doc}
<A>__{sweating with frustration. hector is six feet away, and armed too far away for doc to risk an attack with his lead pipe. doc looks around vaguely, wildly, for another weapon. a fraction of an inch from his nose is the hose wheel. for a split second he hesitates. then slowly, with infinite care, he tightens the heavy brass nozzle and begins to unwind the hose.}
<L>__{interior rear hallway}
<A>__{now hector is alert. he studies pete's twitching face. elaborately he tears a match from the pack and scratches it. it takes fire, cupped in the rampart of his big hands. it lights up the hall, and as hector looks around he sees something through a mirror over his shoulder and six feet away doc materializes out of the shadows of the alcove. as hector whirls, going for his gun, doc swings the hose with sudden deadly aim. it uncoils like a snake, and the brass nozzle crashes with a mighty thud across hector's skull. hector groans. he sinks unconscious to the floor. doc stands there, paralyzed by his action. pete tears toward the lobby.}
<L>__{interior lobby}
<A>__{as pete rushes in. he moves directly to the desk, leans over and presses the buzzer behind the desk three times. he turns and runs back toward the rear of the building.}

<D>__{i will never forgive you, doc...}
<P>__{(he gestures toward hector, out cold)}
<D>__{...for depriving me of that pleasure.}
<A>__{he heads toward the alley.}
<L>__{exterior alley}
<A>__{as macreedy rushes out. he pauses, looking quickly right, then left. he sees a jeep parked at the curb far down the street. he runs toward it. the jeep, its headlights off, starts for him. he swings onto the moving vehicle, falling heavily into the seat beside liz brooks. he slumps there, breathing heavily as the jeep, with a grinding of gears, cuts through the night, picking up speed.}
<L>__{interior rear hallway}
<A>__{as pete joins doc. silently, motionlessly, the two men stare for a long moment at hector particularly at the pistol lying beside him. then they look at each other, and the same thought seems to flash in their minds...}

<D>__{leggo! leggo of me!}
<A>__{suddenly they are hit by a blinding pair of headlights like [...] the beams cut jaggedly through the night, throwing into sharp immediate relief the lava rocks, the broken windmill, the gutted house, the litter strewn, unmarked grave at adobe flat. liz throws away the ignition key. macreedy bails out of the jeep, still holding the girl. close two shot liz and macreedy as they fall to the earth. macreedy pins her down. then in quick succession, four emphatically loud shots from a rifle squirt into the shale around them.}

<P>__{(harshly, through his teeth)}
<D>__{you're stupid, liz. you're a fool. if he finishes me, he's got to finish you.}
<A>__{he looks up blindly into the headlights glaring from the granitic high ground some 60 yards away. his grip on the girl's shoulder is like a steel trap. he pushes her down beside komako's grave, hugging the side of the jeep as a shot rips the gravel at their feet. pulling the girl with him, he takes cover in the slight concavity of the grave. the jeep is between them and the headlights between them and the source of the gunfire. liz struggles to break away. suddenly bullets kick up a storm around him. a bullet smashes into the flowers, exploding tiny cruel fragments of dirt into macreedy's face. he gasps in pain, releasing liz. he rubs his eyes as if to convince himself that he is not blind. liz breaks from the grave. now, five yards from macreedy...}

<A>__{a shot rings out. she falls forward, rolling slowly down the embankment. she lies there. blood trickles from the corner of her pretty mouth. a rattling noise rises from deep in her throat, and then subsides. in the silence the outline of reno smith emerges. holding his rifle at the ready, his silhouette illuminated sharply in the twin beams of light, he climbs down the side of the cliff. he looks toward the jeep and macreedy, not once at the girl at his feet.}
