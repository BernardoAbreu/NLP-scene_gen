<A>__{a newsreel from the war is playing on the screen soldiers marching, smiling, waving to the camera. homer and candy sit together watching. homer is completely fascinated; candy watches homer as much as the news. her expression changes when the newsreel cuts to footage from an air raid.}

<A>__{candy and homer walk out of the theatre, under the marquee and past the poster for "wuthering heights."}
<C>__{candy}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{but you looked as if you liked it.}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i did like it. all i said was, "it's not 'king kong'."}
<A>__{candy makes a face, but in good fun.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{first she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{she did love him!}
<P>__{(teasing him)}
<D>__{how many women have you known?}
<A>__{homer is embarrassed; he ducks the question.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{and what did she die of, exactly?}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{she was torn apart! she died of a broken heart.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{oh, sure!}
<A>__{homer smiles and shakes his head; candy starts to laugh.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{what's the medical explanation?}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{well, she was in a weakened condition...}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i don't know! what about "king kong"?! is that medically possible?}
<A>__{homer smiles; he knows she's teasing him, and he likes it.}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(mock serious)}
<D>__{at least king kong knew what he wanted.}
<A>__{candy pushes him playfully. they're both having a good time, too good a time.}
