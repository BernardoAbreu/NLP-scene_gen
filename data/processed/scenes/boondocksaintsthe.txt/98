<A>__{the man they came for gets off the toilet and pulls up his pants. he is expressionless. he pulls a towel rack from the wall.}
<L>__{interior poolhouse day}
<A>__{the door behind rocco begins to open outward. as the door swings open, rocco tries to angle a gun around to shoot the man who is opening it. but as soon as the man sees his hand, bam! he comes down on it with the towel rack. rocco pulls back in pain dropping his other gun but the gun fires, as the man's blow connects. the shot pierces his stomach and sends him against the wall. he holds his abdomen in pain. there is a moment of recognition between the man and rocco. rocco is terrified as the man dives on him and they begin fighting. murphy jumps to help, but connor pulls him back. they both stand in front of the pool table about thirty feet from rocco.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{let the boy go!}
<A>__{he is now being choked, as he glares at them in disbelief.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{c'mon roc!}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{now, one of these guys is a real sicko. he knew this man. he wanted him to suffer, to feel every second of a painful death.}
<A>__{as rocco is wrestling and punching on the floor. he looks up.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{help me you assholes!}
<P>__{(they continue to cheer)}
<D>__{he's gonna fuckin' kill me!}
<P>__{(he fights harder)}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{this guy is one bad motherfucker.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{i don't wanna die!!!!!}
<A>__{murphy is aching to help but connor is more steady. a man who has been shot starts to regain consciousness. connor turns his back to shoot him (slo mo). murphy sees his opportunity, pulls the cue ball from the table, and rolls it silently across the carpet toward rocco. connor fires with his left hand and as the casing ejects from the gun he catches it in mid air and makes the sign of the cross. rocco is on his back, the man is straddling him. they both have each others throats and are trying to strangle one another. when the ball is within arms reach, rocco slams his hand down on it and knocks his assailant in the skull. he straddles him and begins to mercilessly beat his face in with the cue ball, yelling "you sick fuck!" he finally stops, gets up, runs toward the boys, and throws an exhausted punch at connor who just lays roc down on the pool table and says, "nicely done, boy". murphy tends to roc. connor checks out the man and seems surprised. murphy takes the bloody cue ball from rocco's hand and polishes it off on his jacket, making sure connor cannot see. he replaces it perfectly on the table. smecker now stands in front of the table with the cue shining in the background.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{i've never seen wounds like these before, but whatever he used on this guy, it was a blunt object and they took it with them.}
<A>__{smecker exits to the left as greenly enters from the right, following smecker out. he walks by the table furiously scribbling in his notebook. connor, murphy and rocco exit the room, pennies in the eyes of all the corpses in the background. rocco holds two duffle bags full of poker money. greenly stops, picks up the cue ball and looks at the dead man. he shakes his head and says, "nah".}
