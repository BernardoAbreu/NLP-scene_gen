<L>__{exterior deck day}
<A>__{the albatross is under full sail trying to take advantage of what little wind there is. the skies are gray and dank. tod and terry are at the helm. chuck and john are amid ship. john relieves bill on the forward watch.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{looks like we're gonna get wet.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well, we need it. i want to take a nice long bath and catch some water for my laundry.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{save some for me will you?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you got it. i'm going below.}
<A>__{suddenly, a huge lightning bolt explodes out of the sky and strikes the water a hundred feet off of the starboard beam. everyone jumps.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{jesus!!}
<A>__{skipper bolts onto the deck.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{everybody okay?}
<A>__{the crew nod sheepishly. a very close call.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{all hands keep out of the rigging and stay clear of the masts.}
<A>__{the clouds grow dark but no more lighting. tod laughs nervously. everybody joins in. it's contagious. even skipper manages a smile.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{all right gentlemen. thor's had his fun. let's keep a keen eye.}
<A>__{skipper starts back into the chart house when suddenly, a powerful gust of wind drives the ship hard to a 45 degree list to the starboard. skipper stops and turns. instinctively, john and chuck spring for the rigging to drop sail.}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{no! stay down!!}
<A>__{skipper stares at the sky with the intensity of a cobra. waiting. the wind eases. it becomes eerily still. the ship slows and the sails go slack. silence. skipper maintains his vigil.}
<B>__{close on water}
<A>__{foam and spray appear off of the tops of the swells like the invisible footprint of a locomotive. john sees it first.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{here it comes!!!}
<A>__{everybody turns and looks. skipper's eyes suddenly widen as he realizes...}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(in a whisper)}
<D>__{white squall!}
<A>__{the charging wall of wind slams into the topsails so hard it send a shudder throughout the ship. the wheel is nearly ripped out of tod's hands. instinctively, he tries to turn the ship into the wind.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{hard to starboard!!! hard to starboard!!!}
<A>__{confused, panicked, tod keeps turning to the left, into the wind. skipper struggles to get to the wheel but when the ship heals so badly he slides sideways across the deck.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{no, hard to port!}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{turn the god damned wheel to the right!!!}
<A>__{finally, tod does as he is told. but as soon as the ship starts to come about, the vicious wind drives her further onto her side. as the deck becomes vertical chuck half slips, half tumbles down to the starboard gunnel.}
