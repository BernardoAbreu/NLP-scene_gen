<L>__{interior burger joint night}
<A>__{kirk and molly sit across from one another in a booth. the waiter arrives.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{start you off with something to drink ma'am?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i will have a bass.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{and for your... brother?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{what? oh, i'm not her brother.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry. i just figured...}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you know what, a bass sounds good. make that two.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{great. sorry.}
<A>__{the waiter exits.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{so... you know what i do, what about you? your card said event planner. how'd you get into that?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{well, it wasn't the original plan. i went to law school. ended up at a big firm but i hated it. then, they asked me to plan the christmas party. it was a big hit and a few months later i was done with law.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{wow.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i know. pernicious career move, right?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh, i don't know what that word means. what was it?}
<A>__{close on molly's smile. she finds kirk's unabashed admission very refreshing and endearing.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i'm sorry. like, destructive or...}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh, okay. no, i don't think that's so perni...gious?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{pernicious.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{good new word. no, not pernicious at all. not if you enjoy the work.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i really do. we do a lot of charity events and i get to work with some of the most amazing human beings on some really fun projects. next month i'm doing a cancer benefit with billy joel.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{wow. i love billy joel.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{the only downside is i have to do a lot of public speaking and i've always struggled with stage fright.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh man that's my number one fear. i'm terrified of getting up in front of people. i'd rather get a kentucky root canal.}
<A>__{molly laughs. an older good looking man steps up to the table and stands facing her with his back to kirk.}
<D>__{good looking man excuse me, i was just sitting over at the bar and i was wondering; has anyone told you today that you are absolutely stunning?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{are you seriously hitting on me right in front of my boyfriend?}
<A>__{he turns to kirk and both men start to laugh.}
<D>__{good looking man this is your boyfriend?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh, yeah right! (catches molly's unspoken instructions.) but, yeah. i'm her boyfriend, i guess, so... good looking man really? wow. well... sorry.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{honest mistake.}
<A>__{the man gives kirk a wink and wanders back to the bar.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{did you get a load of that hair piece? what is it with men? i mean, look at you. you're bald and you're fine with it. a little dignity is all i'm saying. the toupees and plugs and the teen dream sports cars... oh geeze, i'm sorry. do you drive a sports car?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i drive a 94 taurus. it's got am fm but i wouldn't call it a sports car per se.}
<A>__{molly laughs and we hard cut through the following snippets of conversation as they eat, chat and laugh.}
<C>__{kirk }
<D>__{so here's this little old lady trying to go through security with six pounds of weed in her girdle!}
<A>__{cut. the food is being served.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{oh, my god! i love that book!}
<A>__{cut. the waitress is picking up the empty plates.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{so, a duck walks into a bar...}
<A>__{cut. molly is laughing while she's paying the bill.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{well, i've got an early morning. i should go. thanks for coming along. this was really fun. and thanks again for helping me out.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no, thank you for dinner. i feel bad that you won't let me...}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{oh, stop it. listen, i handle some of the charity events for the coyotes and i've got some tickets for the hockey game tomorrow night. you interested?}
<A>__{kirk is a bit taken aback and confused. is she actually asking him out on a real date?}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{um, sure. yeah, great. i mean, i'm free tomorrow night.}
<A>__{she digs two tickets out of her purse and hands them over.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{perfect. i hate to see them go to waste. there's two so maybe bring stainer?}
<A>__{kirk's expression is as much relief as disappointment.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh, right. thanks! thank you.}
