<L>__{interior hallway outside adele's apartment day}
<A>__{adele has the chain on the door, talks to karen through the narrow opening.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{you were both in the trunk? together?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{from glades to the turnpike. then i left with glenn.}
<A>__{karen watches adele's face in the opening, freshly made up, heavy on the eye shadow and lip gloss.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{the fbi didn't tell you i was with them?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{they didn't tell me anything, they asked questions.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{but you know what i'm talking about, don't you? about glenn, don't you, and the second car?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{i know a glenn.}
<A>__{she thinks a moment. the door closes and opens again, all the way. adele stands there in a robe, hanging partly open, panties, but no bra.}
<C>__{adele }
<D>__{i'm getting ready to go out. you can come in if you want, sit down for a minute. would you like a diet coke?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no, thanks.}
<A>__{she comes in, checks out the place. she turns a chair from the glasstop table and sits down as adele comes out of the kitchenette with a diet coke and packet of cigarettes.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{those are cute shoes. the kind of jobs i get, i have to wear these killer spikes, they ruin your feet.}
<A>__{she walks away, comes back with an ashtray.}
<C>__{adele }
<D>__{when you were in the trunk with jack...}
<A>__{karen waits, watches her light her cigarette.}
<C>__{adele }
<D>__{he didn't hurt you or anything, did he?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you mean, did he try to jump me? no, but he was kind of talkative.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{he gets that way when he's nervous sometimes.}
<A>__{adele sits down at the other end of the table.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you didn't visit him in prison.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{he didn't want me to.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{i don't know. he was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years. said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{but you spoke to him on the phone.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{he'd call every once in a while.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{he called the day he escaped.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{he did? i don't remember. did he say about me? in the trunk?}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(beat, lies)}
<D>__{he said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{huh. problem is, jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks. it's all he's ever done.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{did you know that when you married him?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{he said he was a card player. i could live with that. i never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. i did go see him in jail to tell him i was filing for divorce. he said, "okay." jack's so easy going.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{he was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.}
<A>__{adele looks out the window. karen waits, looks to an end table where she sees a photograph of jack and adele on a boat somewhere ten years back.}
<C>__{adele }
<D>__{i will say one thing for jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. he was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what i mean.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{really.}
<P>__{(looking at the picture)}
<D>__{hm.}
<A>__{she realizes adele is looking at her.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught. i'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{buddy'll take care of him. keep him out've trouble. he's jack's conscience. always has been.}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{he tell you how they met?}
<A>__{karen shakes her head.}
<C>__{adele }
<D>__{jack came out of a bank he just robbed in pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start. battery was dead. he looks over, sees buddy sitting in a burgundy bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. turns out, buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing. buddy says, i will take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{they musta robbed fifty banks together.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{till they got busted.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{that wasn't jack's fault. no, that was on account of buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job before they'd done it instead of after. she called the fbi and they both went down, ended up at lompoc.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i think buddy felt kinda bad about that.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{any idea where i could find buddy? or glenn?}
<A>__{adele looks at karen, then jumps at the sound of three quick raps on the door.}
<C>__{chino's voice}
<D>__{adele? you in there?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{chino}
<D>__{i want to speak with you, please.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{who is it?}
<C>__{chino's voice}
<D>__{i talk to the guy you work for, emil. he tole me your number and where you live. see, i'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{oh. uh huh.}
<C>__{chino's voice}
<D>__{you did work for emil, right?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{yeah, i was emil's box jumper for almost four years.}
<C>__{chino's voice}
<D>__{you were his what, his box?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{his assistant.}
<A>__{karen looks at the door. something's wrong... through the glass bricks that line one side of the door, we see blurred movement on the other side, someone doing something ...}
<C>__{adele }
<D>__{you say you perform in the miami area?}
<C>__{chino's voice}
<D>__{yes, around here. i was a mayishan in cuba before i come here. manuel the mayishan was my name.}
<A>__{and now karen and adele look at each other.}
<C>__{chino's voice }
<D>__{can you open the door?}
<A>__{karen shakes her head "no."}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{i'm not dressed.}
<C>__{chino's voice}
<D>__{listen to me.}
<P>__{(lowers his voice)}
<D>__{i'm a good friend of jack foley.}
<A>__{boom. karen gets to her feet, brings her bag to the edge of the table, sees adele staring at her.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{ask him his name.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{chino's voice}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{jose chirino.}
<A>__{karen brings her beretta out of the bag.}
<C>__{chino's voice }
<D>__{or maybe you hear jack foley call me chino. i'm the same person.}
<A>__{karen moves along the table to adele...}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{tell him to wait in the hall, you have to get dressed. say it loud.}
<A>__{as adele speaks, karen racks the slide on her 9mm.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{wait in the hall! i have to get dressed!}
<C>__{chino's voice}
<D>__{tell me where is jack foley, i don't bother you no more.}
<A>__{karen motions for adele to keep talking as she takes a position beside the door, where we now see chino's silhouette in one of the three glass panels in the centre of the door.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{i don't know where he is.}
<C>__{chino's voice}
<D>__{listen, i'm the one help jack escape from prison. he tole me, i can't find him to see you. so why don't you open this fucking door. okay? so we can speak.}
<C>__{adele}
<P>__{(staring at karen)}
<D>__{go away, or i will call the police.}
<C>__{chino's voice}
<D>__{why you want to do that, to a frien'?}
<A>__{adele says nothing. then...}
<C>__{chino's voice }
<D>__{okay, you don't want to help me, i'm leaving.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i'm going now. i see you maybe some time, okay? bye bye.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{go in the bedroom and }
<A>__{suddenly, chino's fist wrapped in his shirt explodes through one of the glass panels. adele and karen both jump as chino pushes his arm through, reaches for the door knob... ...but karen grabs the knob first and, using all of her weight as leverage, pivots and flings the door open with chino's arm still sticking through the glass... ...the force of which slingshots the man into the room where he bangs against a wall and falls to the floor. dazed, chino reaches for his .22 as he now tries to get to his feet. karen brings up her beretta in two hands, cocks it and puts the front sight on his chest.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{leave it where it is.}
<C>__{chino}
<P>__{(frowning)}
<D>__{wait. you not adele?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest. put the gun on the table. i mean, now.}
<C>__{chino}
<D>__{oh. then this must be adele...}
<A>__{he now aims the gun point blank at adele.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{put it down or i will shoot.}
<C>__{chino}
<D>__{you wouldn't shoot me, would you?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what do you want to bet?}
<C>__{chino}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i could walk out of here.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{if you move, if you look at her again, you're dead.}
<A>__{chino doesn't move. keeps his gun on adele. karen starts walking towards him...}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{you can live or die, it's up to you.}
<C>__{chino}
<D>__{oh, is that right? you going to shoot me? nice girl like you?}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you don't, huh?}
<A>__{and with that, she kicks him in the knee. chino buckles over and she hits him on the side of the head with her gun...}
<C>__{adele }
<D>__{on your knees.}
<A>__{he does as he's told. karen raises his jacket, feels around his waist from behind.}
<C>__{adele }
<D>__{lie face down on the floor.}
<C>__{chino}
<P>__{(hurting)}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{she kicks him over onto his stomach and stays there. she puts her foot to his back as she reaches for the phone, dials. she sees adele staring at her.}
<C>__{chino }
<P>__{(to adele)}
<D>__{excuse me...}
<A>__{karen looks at adele a moment, then says into the phone...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{daniel burdon, please. karen sisco.}
<C>__{chino}
<D>__{excuse me, adele?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{chino}
<D>__{you do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?}
<C>__{adele}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{chino}
<D>__{tell me, how do you do that?}
<A>__{adele looks at karen, who shoves chino's head to the floor with her foot.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{shut up.}
<C>__{burdon }
<D>__{karen. where are you? i been trying to get a hold of you.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{daniel. listen }
<C>__{burdon }
<D>__{where are you? i been trying to reach you.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm at adele delisi's.}
<C>__{burdon }
<D>__{what we already talked to her. that's a dead end.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(looking at chino)}
<D>__{yeah, i know. i was just leaving. why were you trying to reach me?}
<C>__{burdon }
<D>__{there was a buddy bragg at lompoc around the same time foley was there. we got an address for him at the adams hotel in hallandale. i want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy. if he does, you call me right away...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{all right, but...}
<C>__{burdon }
<D>__{but don't you do anything. you just have a seat, wait for me to get there.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{sure, daniel.}
<C>__{burdon }
<D>__{now. what is it you wanted to tell me?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{oh, i was just wondering, if i were to bring in chirino, would you put me on the task force?}
<C>__{burdon }
<P>__{(impatient)}
<D>__{what? is that what you're calling me about?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{yes or no, daniel. if i get him, will you let me go after foley?}
<C>__{burdon }
<D>__{yeah, sure, karen. you bring in chirino, you can be on the task force.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{that's all i wanted to know.}
<C>__{burdon }
<D>__{good. now forget about the ex wife and get over to the adams hotel.}
<A>__{karen hangs up, looks at adele. adele nods.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{you're good.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{thank you.}
