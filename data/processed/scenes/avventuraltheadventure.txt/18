<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{a patrol boat is anchored off the cliff of a small island where the current running through the surrounding waters comes to an end. sandro is leaning against the wall of a dilapidated building, which is constructed right on that part of the rock where the sea close by discharges all kinds of refuse. four or five islanders are busy scouring through the accumulated rubbish. they are taciturn, poorly dressed people who every now and then come to blows over the possession of some article washed ashore by the waves. sandro is watching them, feeling distraught and melancholy. one of the carabinieri who had accompanied him is walking up and down beside an elderly gentleman who is obviously one of the local gentry.}
<C>__{sandro}
<P>__{(to the carabiniere)}
<D>__{it's already two hours... what are we going to do?}
<C>__{carabiniere}
<D>__{it takes about twenty to twenty two hours for the current to reach here from lisca bianca.}
<C>__{elderly gentleman}
<D>__{and sometimes even twenty four... depending on the wind...}
<C>__{carabiniere}
<D>__{if the girl disappeared yesterday afternoon, we'll have to wait at least until three or four o'clock.}
<A>__{sandro looks at them without commenting, then turns and walks away towards the center of the village. the houses and shops around the square are very plain and shabby. sandro spots a barber shop and, fingering his day old beard, enters for a shave. shortly thereafter, a clamor of voices is heard outside and sandro comes dashing out of the shop. seeing the islanders fighting and arguing about something drawn up from the sea, he runs over to find out what it is. as he arrives on the scene, two policemen step out of the confusion dragging a large crate, which they carry over to the door of a nearby shack, amid the protests of the islanders who are still arguing and shouting among themselves.}
<C>__{voices}
<D>__{it belongs to me... we found it...}
<C>__{gentleman}
<D>__{back... stand back!}
<A>__{the two policemen set the crate down and lift the lid. it is full of cigarettes.}
<C>__{carabiniere}
<P>__{(to the islanders)}
<D>__{you see? it contains cigarettes. we'll have to confiscate it.}
<A>__{the islanders react violently, shouting out all sorts of epithets. but the policemen manage to restrain them and soon the commotion is quieted down.}
<C>__{carabiniere}
<P>__{(to sandro)}
<D>__{these people are contemptible. they have no sense of dignity at all.}
<C>__{sandro}
<P>__{(referring to the crate)}
<D>__{and you say that came from lisca bianca?}
<C>__{carabiniere}
<D>__{it couldn't have come from anywhere else. at least, somewhere from that vicinity... but i really can't understand it. contraband cigarettes on that island! it's the first time that ever happened.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{look... i'd like to get back to lisca bianca.}
<C>__{carabiniere}
<D>__{but how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. could be that something might turn up there.}
<C>__{sandro}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{but even here we were supposed to find who knows what... and all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.}
<C>__{carabiniere}
<P>__{(shrugging his shoulders)}
<D>__{as you wish.}
