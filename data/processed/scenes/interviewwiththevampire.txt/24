<L>__{exterior new orleans night}
<A>__{a big, lavish drinking place with a raised stage. italian actors in buffoonish costumes act crude commedia dell'arte on the stage. plantation owners in soiled brocade, lace, crooked wigs watch the show as tavern wenches move about.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{this was new orleans, a magical and magnificent place to live. in which a vampire, richly dressed might attract no more notice in the evening than hundreds of other exotic creatures.}
<A>__{louis and lestat by a table, in the shadow of a tree. teresa, a tavern wench, sits on lestat's lap, pouring drinks for the two of them. she lifts a fresh glass to lestat's lips as he flirts with her.}
<C>__{teresa}
<D>__{come on, mon cher. the best in the colony. once you touch this you'll never go to any other tavern again.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you think so, cherie? but what if i'd rather taste your lips?}
<C>__{teresa}
<D>__{my lips are even sweeter still...}
<A>__{she kisses him. he lets his tongue play with hers, then runs it down her neck. she swoons with pleasure. then he sinks his teeth gently in her neck, looking playfully behind at louis, who if appalled and fascinated.}
<B>__{antics on the stage}
<A>__{laughter rocks the tavern. lestat slips the pale and dead teresa into a chair beside him and folds her hands on the table. no one notices. he lays gold coins on the table and touches louis' knee.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{let's get out of here!}
<A>__{lestat rushes out, thrilled with himself.}
