<L>__{interior alex's apartment still later}
<A>__{it is really late. everyone's gone except the tall girl and alex, who sit on the couch playing a nba live on the xbox. gigi enters from the kitchen.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{i think i've rounded up the last of the beer bottles.}
<A>__{the tall girl and alex do not look up from the game. gigi stands there awkwardly.}
<C>__{gigi }
<D>__{so, umm what game is this?}
<A>__{they ignore her. she looks around. it's awkward.}
<C>__{gigi }
<D>__{well, maybe i should just you know i mean it's past three and }
<C>__{tall girl}
<D>__{yes!! suck it!}
<A>__{alex tosses down his controller.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you are sensational.}
<A>__{the tall girl beams. gigi flinches.}
<C>__{tall girl}
<D>__{did you say it's past three? man, i gotta go.}
<A>__{gigi suppresses a smile. the tall girl gives alex a hug, and heads out. gigi, finally alone with alex, sits next to him on the couch. they're silent for a moment.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{thanks for staying and helping clean up but i really gotta get to bed.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{is that an invitation?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{i'm sorry. that was cheesy. i'm not good at this.}
<A>__{but then before alex knows what's happening, gigi is lunging at him. she puts his face in her hands, and starts to kiss him. really kiss him. finally, gigi pulls away. she looks breathless.}
<C>__{gigi }
<D>__{yes!}
<A>__{alex looks a little afraid.}
<C>__{gigi }
<D>__{i knew it. i knew it. the best relationships grow out of friendships.}
<A>__{she goes in to kiss him again. this time he stops her.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{wait what?}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{ummmm....}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{now you and i are in a relationship?}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{well, i'd say if we're not at relationship station ship, we're at least on the track.}
<A>__{alex gets up off the couch.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{and why would you think that, exactly?}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{because there were you know signs.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{really? like what?}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{ummm it was good to hear from me. you talked to me even when you were with a girl. i felt something...}
<A>__{she trails off. alex is not pleased.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{what are you talking about? what have i been saying since i met you? if a guy wants to date you he will make it happen. he will ask you out. did i ask you out?}
<C>__{gigi}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{why would you do this?}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{i thought you were watts.}
<A>__{alex doesn't even hear her.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{why do women do this? why do they build this stuff up in their minds, take each little thing a guy does and twist it into something else }
<A>__{gigi stands there, embarrassed, taking alex's berating.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{i'd rather be like that than like you.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{maybe i dissect each little thing, and put myself out there too much, and maybe i even thrive on the drama of it all but at least that means i still care. you think you've won because women are expendable to you? sure, you don't get hurt or make an ass of yourself that way, but you don't fall in love that way, either. you haven't won, alex. you're alone.}
<A>__{gigi grabs her bag.}
<C>__{gigi }
<D>__{i may do a lot of stupid shit but i know i'm a lot closer to finding someone than you are.}
<A>__{gigi turns and heads out the door.}
