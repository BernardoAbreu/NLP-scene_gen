<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior scud's workshop night}
<A>__{the back of the workshop. scud takes a hit of weed then resumes working on one of the uv entry lights it's been taken half apart and tweaked out with cables and a crystal prism. whistler is there too, loading magazines.}
<C>__{whistler}
<P>__{(observing scud)}
<D>__{the hell are you fiddling with there?}
<C>__{scud}
<P>__{(proud, succinct)}
<D>__{tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a uv laser going.}
<C>__{whistler}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{you're wasting your time, already been tried.}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{yeah, but you didn't have the scudster working on it, did you?}
<C>__{whistler}
<P>__{(testy)}
<D>__{nope. back then we did not.}
<C>__{scud}
<P>__{(unfazed)}
<D>__{so how long have you known blade, anyway?}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{going on twenty years now.}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{blade doesn't talk about the old days much.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{blade doesn't talk about anything much.}
<P>__{(nodding to scud)}
<D>__{what about you, though?}
<A>__{scud pulls up his t shirt. his abdomen is covered in a network of horrific scars. like something you'd see on the survivor of a shark attack.}
<C>__{whistler }
<D>__{pretty.}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{i was backpacking. hooked up with these two chicks who were off to see the burning man festival. we were gonna take "e", have ourselves a little freeball out in the desert. you know the riff, "dear penthouse, i never thought this would happen to me, but "}
<A>__{scud takes a phillip and adjust some screws on the laser.}
<C>__{scud }
<D>__{anyway, halfway through our three's company marathon, janet and chrissy started taking chunks out of me. woulda died too if blade hadn't shown up and staked those mamacitas a new honeyhole.}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{things kinda fell in place after that.}
<A>__{scud jiggles the necklace of fangs around his neck.}
<C>__{scud }
<D>__{took myself a few souvenirs, though.}
<A>__{scud triggers the modified entry light. the light pulses like a series of flash bulbs going off, creating a stroboscopic effect as a wafer thin, super concentrated blue beam of light slices through the shadows. scud looks to whistler and smiles.}
<C>__{scud }
<D>__{mmm mmm. poppa's got a brand new bag.}
