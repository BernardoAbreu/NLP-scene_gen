<C>__{mr. haley}
<D>__{how do you and autumn know each other? you a friend of ray's?}
<A>__{darnell is jolted by this question. it's obvious that autumn has never told her dad about him.}

<P>__{(filling the void)}
<D>__{ah, i tutor him...}
<C>__{mr. haley}
<D>__{oh really? in what?}

<D>__{math and english.}
<C>__{mr. haley}
<D>__{ah.}
