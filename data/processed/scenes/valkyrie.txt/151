<L>__{interior war ministry fromm's office night}
<A>__{stauffenberg works frantically in a room full of officers the energy here being the antithesis of goebbels' office the morale quickly waning. he ignores the radio, writing orders, making phone calls, fighting to keep the coup alive. but we know now his orders are hitting a dead end.}
<C>__{radio announcer}
<D>__{...the fuhrer himself suffered no major injuries and resumed his work immediately...}
<A>__{stauffenberg turns off the radio, grabbing haeften just as he is coming in.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{send the following teleprint to all army commanders... `broadcast communique not correct. the fuhrer is dead. orders to be carried out with utmost dispatch.'}
<A>__{haeften nods and leaves. stauffenberg turns back to his work, coming face to face with a deeply troubled beck. stauffenberg whispers, frustrated...}
<C>__{stauffenberg }
<D>__{i saw the blast...}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{what the hell kind of coup is this?}
<A>__{all eyes turn to find witzleben. hours ago he was a civilian, now he is a pompous, know it all general.}
<C>__{witzleben}
<D>__{the military districts are receiving contradictory reports. i've got men sitting around joking about whose turn it is to arrest whom. neither the capital nor the radio network are under our control. and where are the troops? you'd think there would be some activity going on in this city.}
<P>__{(to stauffenberg)}
<D>__{the word is all over the street that hitler is still alive. we trusted you and you failed us. you should have stayed. to be sure.}
<C>__{olbricht }
<D>__{and who would have led the men here in berlin? you?}
<A>__{finding his balls, olbricht confronts witzleben.}
<C>__{olbricht }
<D>__{the colonel did more than any man could have hoped. if anyone is to blame it's }
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{field marshal witzleben is right. i am the officer in charge. i am the man responsible. no one else.}
<A>__{olbricht is moved and rightly so. meanwhile:}
<C>__{witzleben}
<D>__{i'm going home to await my inevitable arrest.}
<A>__{witzleben turns, marching out. the room remains ill at ease, everyone having just witnessed a serious blow to the resistance. those anonymous soldiers present exchange glances of concern.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{i'm sorry, colonel.}
<A>__{after a beat, olbricht turns and leaves. close on lieutenant herber, tucked away in a corner of the office. he looks at stauffenberg in a new light now, something darker no longer the admirer. he shares a look with two other officers. a wordless understanding. he leaves and they follow.}
