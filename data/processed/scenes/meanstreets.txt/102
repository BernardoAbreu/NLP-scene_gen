<A>__{charlie feels that it would be better not to pursue the pointerior}
<C>__{giovanni}
<D>__{what mario's trying to tell you, charlie, is that you're wasting your time with those "couple of courses" ...you don't need them. there are a lot of things that can be taken care of...you know what i mean?}
<A>__{they all laugh.}
