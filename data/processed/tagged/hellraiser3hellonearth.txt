<L>__{exterior derelict street twilight}
<A>__{night is falling in a forgotten part of the city. the street lights are a joke three out of four are dead. only a large moon and some cloud streaked stars illuminate this dark and derelict street. once the hub of an industrial area, now the buildings are abandoned, the sidewalks choked with litter and debris. stores are boarded up, windows are glassless, walls are graffitied. at various points, several bums warm their hands at trash can fires.}
<B>__{angle on two bums}
<A>__{ as their eyes move, following something moving down the street. heard off is the sound of a smooth and powerful engine.}
<B>__{angle on street}
<A>__{down this boulevard of decay and despair drives an incongruously expensive car a range rover. a rich kid is going shopping. the car cruises the ruins until it pulls up outside the only open store on the block.}
<B>__{angle on store}
<A>__{a dim light bulb shines within the only indicator that the store is still trading. its windows are grimy, its door defaced. above the door barely legible through the accrued dirt of city years a sign; carducci's antiques and curios.}
<B>__{angle on car}
<A>__{the side door opens helped on its way by the kick of an expensive leather boot and jp monroe steps out. jp is 24, rich, handsome, and spoiled. his hair is slick with designer grease, his slim frame is wrapped in a $600 leather jacket. for a moment he surveys the store and casts contemptuous glances up and down the ruined street. he shows no anxiety at being in this twilight part of town. cocooned in the confidence of wealth, he's never felt threatened in his life. satisfied he's in the right place, he walks confidently through the doorway.}
<L>__{interior carducci's antiques night}
<A>__{the store itself looks like an antique old wood panelling and shelving, victorian display cases, and faded wallpaper. it is grimy, dusty, and dimly lit and apparently unattended. it is packed with merchandise shelves and aisles overflow onto the floor making the place a maze to walk through. the stock is a strange surreal mix. discarded items from 50's america (norge fridges, toasters, frankie lymon albums) share space with older items; framed pictures, victorian automata, wax dolls, and (a specialty of the store?) items of punishment; stocks, iron boots, chastity belts, whips. could that really be an electric chair glimpsed in the shadowed back of the room?}
<B>__{angle on jp}
<A>__{he wanders through the merchandise, casting appraising glances at some items. some he even runs his hands over grimacing at the dust and grime they leave on his fingers. but his manner suggests he is looking for something specific. near the room's center is an old hoarding from the dead days of vaudeville and travelling shows. it is tall and broad and is leaning against something behind it.}
<B>__{angle on hoarding}
<A>__{ which is colorfully and garishly decorated and full of hyperbolic come ons to long dead punters: you will be amazed! they shouldn't be alive! freaks of nature!}

<C>__{jp}
<D>__{wow ...}
<A>__{revealed is a six foot tall black rectangular pillar, covered in beautifully detailed 3 d carvings all in the same matt black finish as the pillar itself. the pillar is extremely bizarre, as if a new york avant garde sculptor has interpreted a totem pole for jaded modern tastes. the carvings are of dead rats, copulating skeletons, filigree patterned boxes, and faces. one of these faces recognizable to the audience but not to jp is the ossified visage of pinhead, the demon from the first two hellraiser pictures.}
<B>__{angle on jp}
<A>__{ as he leans in to study this face, already fascinated by its calm cruelty and promise of dark wisdom. a voice off startles him.}
<C>__{bum}
<D>__{you want it?}
<A>__{jp whirls round in shock. a bum is standing close to him.}
<B>__{angle on bum}
<A>__{he has long matted black hair and a similarly greasy beard. his eyes are a piercing, excited blue. otherwise he is indistinguishable from those we saw on the street outside ragged, tatty clothes, features blackened with grime.}
<B>__{angle on jp}
<A>__{ as he glances round the store and past the bum to the door beyond; has this character just wandered in from the street?}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{is it yours?}
<B>__{angle on both}
<A>__{the bum smiles, shaking his head knowingly.}
<C>__{bum}
<D>__{no. not mine. yours.}
<A>__{jp nods, still a little uncertain.}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{how much do you want for it?}
<C>__{bum}
<D>__{whatever you think its worth.}
<A>__{jp digs a hand into his back pocket and pulls out a wad of cash. without counting or checking, he proffers it. the bum's hand flies out and siezes jp's, pressing the money between their palms, making the exchange into a handclasp. in the background, out of focus, is pinhead's face on the pillar.}
<C>__{bum }
<D>__{enjoy ...}
<A>__{the focus switches so that the hands in foreground blur and pinhead's frozen face becomes sharp, as if he is silently watching this deal take place. the bum's hand moves away with the money as we}

<D>__{it's a mystery to me ...}
<A>__{smash cut : to full frame video image image of joanne summerskill, standing and looking directly into camera, as if we are watching a tv broadcast. in shot behind her is a quiet hospital emergency room no patients, no staff, just beds and intensive care equipment. joanne or joey, as she prefers to be called is 23 years old, an attractive and clever brunette, with a quiet sadness in her eyes that she usually manages to keep almost hidden. dressed in the stylish but sedate garb of a tv newsperson, she holds a microphone marked with the logo of her station, w qqy. her direct address to the unseen tv camera continues.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{most nights this inner city emergency room would be a chaos of blood and panic and grace under pressure. but tonight, as you see, it's like death took a holiday. it's a mystery to me ... a mystery how those assholes at assignments knew it. this is joey summerskill for w qqy. emergency room. no story. really, really pissed off.}
<A>__{despite the nature of her last few words, joey has ironically kept up the manner and delivery of a newscaster. now, she breaks mood, looks away from the camera, and, with a dismissive wave of the hand, begins to walk out of shot.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{ah, break it down, doc. it's a bust.}
<T>__{cut to wide:}
<A>__{ to reveal that we are not watching a broadcast at all but are in the er in real time. as well as joey, the room contains her cameraman ("doc" fisher) and an er nurse. doc a 45 year old with a weight problem, a nicotine addiction, and a cynical attitude lowers a shoulder mounted video camera and watches joey walk to a water cooler against a wall. his expression is a mix of exasperation and sympathy. the nurse is a middle aged woman of asian ancestry. she has a puzzled expression as she addresses doc.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{she can talk like this on television? she can say this thing? this assholes?}
<A>__{doc replies but keeps his eyes on joey as he crosses to her.}

<D>__{no sweat, sweetheart. it's for the european satellite .... joey; rein it in, kid. they couldn't've known.}
<A>__{joey sucks angrily at water from a paper cup and then crushes and bins the cup like an act of revenge.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{i know. i know. but it's just so ... neat, isn't it? the first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{yeah, well like you said it's a mystery. but that's all it is. mystery. not malice. what, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?}
<A>__{doc is interrupted by the ringing of a cell phone he has holstered at his waist. he picks it up.}

<D>__{no need. martin's already there. hurry. you've got ambulances to beat.}
<A>__{the line goes dead. doc looks at joey. she heard it all. he shrugs apologetically.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{better hurry, doc. a real story. with a real reporter.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{joey .... look, you wanna ride? i can go by your place.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{you'd lose the money shots. no. i will catch a bus. or a cab. don't worry about it. go.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{ok. be careful. and lighten up. story of your life could be right round the corner.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{that is the story of my life.}
<A>__{with a rueful smile, joey watches doc leave. joey and the nurse exchange glances joey's impassive but vaguely friendly, the nurse's a little disapproving; if the camera's gone, what the hell are you still doing here?}
<L>__{interior hospital corridor night}
<A>__{joey makes her solitary way along a medium length corridor that has two sets of double swing doors at either end, one set giving on to the er, the other toward an exit. joey is heading for the latter, her mood sad and defeated.}
<B>__{angle on exit doors}
<A>__{suddenly smash! the doors burst open from the other side.}
<B>__{angle on corridor}
<A>__{the mood is suddenly fast and urgent as a gurney is wheeled rapidly through the doors. two paramedics, both male, both about joey's age, are pushing the gurney at a run and talking rapidly to each other. they completely ignore joey and also ignore the teenage girl who is running beside the gurney. the girl terri is 18 or 19. she is a pale faced blonde dressed as if for a desperately seeking susan party and is keeping up a stream of chatter as if rehearsing excuses. as joey flattens herself against the corridor wall to let them pass, it is neither the paramedics nor terri that get her attention. it is the boy on the gurney. angle on gurney boy the teenage boy lies flat on his back semi conscious, his eyelids fluttering, his breathing shallow. horribly, shockingly, dangling from his face and body are long, heavy chains that drag and rattle along the corridor floor. there are at least sixteen of them and they seem firmly buried in his skin.}
<B>__{angle on corridor}
<A>__{the dialogue as the gurney is rushed to the er doors is rapid fire and overlapped, the paramedics responding only to each other and ignoring the two girls comments and questions.}

<C>__{paramedic 1}
<D>__{yeah, sure. five times a fucking day. just push!}
<A>__{once the gurney has passed her, joey runs along behind it.}

<B>__{angle on er through doors}
<A>__{the nurse and a middle aged doctor are seen through the doors preparing emergency equipment. the doctor already has fibrillator pads in his hands. the paramedics follow the gurney through and, turning rapidly, push the doors closed from the inside.}

<P>__{(over her shoulder)}
<D>__{it's nothing to do with me. i wasn't even with him.}
<A>__{joey catches up with her a couple of yards short of the doors. she grabs at her arm to slow her down. terri turns, snatching her arm away in a sudden moment of fierce anger. she backs toward the doors, making gestures of dismissal and denial with her hands.}

<D>__{look, lady! i told you! it's not my problem! i was just there!}

<C>__{joey}
<D>__{under the underground? what's that? where is ...}
<A>__{suddenly, the conversation is interrupted by a shatteringly loud scream, agonized and terrified, coming from the er. both girls freeze but then their reactions are very different: joey turns instantly and runs back toward the er. terri watches her for a beat and then heads through the other doors. the scream continues, a howling horrible sound. joey reaches the er doors and throws them open. and freezes in terrified shock.}
<L>__{interior emergency room night}
<B>__{the doctor}
<A>__{ is on the floor, as if flung there by some powerful force. the fibrillator pads are still in his hands and his expression is awe struck and disbelieving.}
<B>__{the nurse}
<A>__{ is cowering behind a mobile tray of surgical instruments, muttering to herself and making the gesture of the cross.}
<B>__{the two paramedics}
<A>__{ are flattened against the far wall, terror on their faces.}
<B>__{angle on table}
<A>__{the boy is on the emergency table. it's him that's screaming. his body is arched tight in shock, eyes and mouth wide open. he's wired up to an ecg and the monitor shows a heartbeat that should be measured on the richter scale. the chains all still connected to his face and his body are rigid and tight, being pulled straight up into the air as if tugged taut by invisible hands. the boy's skin is stretched and pulled at those points where the chains are connected to him and it seems horribly possible that his flesh will burst if the pressure continues. the scene is held for a terrible frozen moment. then suddenly the chains drop, the scream stops, and the boy's body slumps. there is a massive electrical surge. the ecg flat lines before it and the other monitors go haywire, sparking and spluttering.}
<T>__{cut to wide:}
<A>__{the lights in the room flicker and strobe. the fibrillator pads arc angrily. the doctor flings them away. electric energy seems to run along the slumped chains and they disappear as if dissolved in some impossible electric meltdown. lighting and machinery return to normal (ecg still flat lining) and the medical staff stare thunder struck at the dead boy. for the first time, the other people in the er become aware of joey's presence in the doorway.}
