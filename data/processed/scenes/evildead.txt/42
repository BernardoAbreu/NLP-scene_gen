<C>__{scott}
<D>__{you'd think she's three years old or something.}
<A>__{scott slams the door behind him. ashly sighs. he moves to the broken window and reaches through it to close the outside shutters.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{he's really been bothering you hasn't he?}
<A>__{ashly walks to a chair near the other window.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{no. it's not scott. scotty's okay. it's just that ever since we came up here, things have been a little too tense. (he sits) all these crazy things going on. and look at that window we're gonna have to pay for that window now.}

<D>__{what'ya say we stay up for a while and listen to the storm.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{deal. lemme check on cheryl. i will be right back.}
<A>__{from across the room, she is seen opening cheryl's door a crack. linda asks if she is all right, and gets a muffled reply. in the foreground, ashly removes the small box he showed to cheryl earlier and places it in his hand. he glances behind to linda. she closes cheryl's door and walks back to find ashly sound asleep with the box in his hand. she reaches for the box and ashly opens his eyes to watch. linda looks at him, but his eyes are closed again in time to still appear fast asleep. linda turns her attention back to the box. ashly watches again wide eyed as she removes it from his hand. quickly, linda turns to him but as expected, ashly is sleeping like a baby. she begins to turn back toward the box and ashly opens his eyes, but linda turns back again in time to catch him with his eyes wide open.}
