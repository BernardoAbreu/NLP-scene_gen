<L>__{82 interior night m.r.}
<A>__{ashly jolts backwards out of her room to escape through the front door. he steps outside and stops to look back in. he can see the main room, but finds it difficult to see in linda's room, being lost in the shadows. something ragged and bloody grabs him. it is scott's mutilated body ripped and torn to shreds. he is still alive. ashly looks behind him through the door to linda's room. he can barely make out linda who sits on the bed watching him with glaring white eyes. ashly helps scott to the couch so he can sit. scott is in agony and can barely speak.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{ash, i think i'm dying. jesus, i can't feel my legs.}
<C>__{ashly}

<A>__{he throws another log on the fire.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{you'll see.}
<A>__{he looks off into linda's bedroom again, but she is gone. she is now sitting in the corner of the main room where ashly is, watching him. scott begins to cough with hor rible rasping sounds.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{it's, it's not gonna let us leave... cheryl...cheryl was right...we're all gonna die here...}
<C>__{ashly}

<A>__{scott passes out.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{scotty. scott!}

<C>__{scott}
<D>__{jesus ash. i don't want to die. so... so lonely to die like this. you're not gonna leave me are you? are you ash?}

<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{scott, listen to me please, for god's sake. is there a way around the chasm?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{there is...one way, the trail...but the trees, they know...don't you see they're alive!! they're ali ahhhhhhh!}
<A>__{his sentence is cut short as he cries out in sharp pain. blood dribbles from his nostrils and he doubles over grabbing his stomach. linda begins to laugh. ashly looks to her, or rather what posesses her with hatred.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{she continues to laugh. cheryl in the cellar joins in the laughter. ashly walks to linda and slaps her but she continues. he grabs a hunting rifle from a rack on the wall, loads it with shells, flips off the safety and places the barrels against linda's head.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{god forgive me linda.}
<A>__{the laughter stops and her eyes return to normal. it is linda again. ashly puts down the rifle.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{ash, oh ash, help me! please.}
<A>__{she hugs him tightly.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{don't let them take me away again, please, please, please.}
<C>__{ashly}
<P>__{(crying and holding her tightly) i}
<D>__{won't, i won't i promise.}
<A>__{cheryl's voice is heard from the blackness of the cellar.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{ashly? ashly, help me. let me out of here. i'm all right now.}
<A>__{ashly releases linda and moves cautiously to the cellar. linda remains behind nervously fumbling with her necklace.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{i'm all right now, ashly. i'm all right. come unlock this chain and let me out.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{cheryl?}
<A>__{there is no reply from the cellar. ashly looks through the crack but sees only darkness. he reaches for the chain and begins to unlock it, but sensing something wrong, he stops.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{cheryl?}
<A>__{he puts his ear to the floor listening for the slight est sound. cheryl's arms rip through the floor boards and grab ashly's head. he breaks away and her hand reaches for the chain but cannot quite grasp it. slowly it withdraws beneath the floor.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<P>__{(a little too sweet) ash, what are you}
<D>__{doing? this is your sister cheryl. don't you recognize me?}
<A>__{her voice drifts off, and the evil leughter resumes from the celler.}
<C>__{ashly}
<P>__{(crying and yelling to the cellar)}
<D>__{you bastards! why are you doing this? why?}
<A>__{there is silence for a moment. laughter from behind him begins again. it is linda. her eyes are white once more, and she laughs at ashly.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{oh...linda.}
<A>__{with newly found courage, ashly angrily grabs linda by the legs and drags her outside.}
