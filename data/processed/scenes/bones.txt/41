<L>__{exterior bones' building morning}
<A>__{patrick's on a ladder replacing glass in the upper windows. from down the block, we see cinnabar heading out of her mother's house, holding her portfolio. the corners of papers sticking out, splashes of color visible. patrick sees cinnabar about to walk beneath his ladder.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{careful. that's bad luck.}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{that place is already bad luck.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{no. it goes way back. or so my momma says.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{what else does she say?}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{nothing. you'd think she was crazy. and she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy momma's not.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{way i figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total b.s. and our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{my momma says every house is two houses. every street, two streets. there's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one. the city of the dead.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us? fingers rotting off?}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{maybe. but there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{lucky thing.}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{yeah. but when something bad happens, something really bad the wall breaks. the fabric tears.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{the dead get out?}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{or the living fall in. who knows.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{and you believe her?}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{if i did, i wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.}
<A>__{she sees her bus pulling up at the corner and runs for it, leaving only her smile with patrick. she passes maurice and bill, pulling up. bill has to pull maurice's dog like attention away from the way cinnabar's bottom moves as she walks down the street to focus at the matter at hand: unloading their shitload of equipment.}
