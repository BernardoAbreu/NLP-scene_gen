<L>__{interior living room, chieko's apartment day}
<D>__{chieko opens the door and mitsu walks in. they greet each other with a handshake where they end up touching their index fingers to each other's hearts.}
<C>__{mitsu}
<D>__{are you ready?}
<C>__{chieko}
<D>__{yeah, i'm just going to get my bag. chieko goes to get her bag. mitsu sees the policeman's card on the entrance table and looks at it. chieko comes back and mitsu asks her about it in sign language.}
<C>__{mitsu}
<D>__{the cops came again?}
<C>__{chieko}
<D>__{yeah. they hadn't come in nine months. but these were different cops.}
<C>__{mitsu}
<D>__{did they come to ask about your mothers' death?}
<C>__{chieko}
<D>__{no, but they're probably going to ask my dad about the same things.}
<C>__{mitsu}
<D>__{they're just not convinced, are they? chieko shakes her head, remains pensive and then smiles.}
<C>__{chieko}
<D>__{believe it or not, i liked one of the cops. chieko puts kenji's card in her purse.}
<C>__{mitsu}
<D>__{did you put on some panties? chieko smiles, lifts up her skirt and exposes her naked pubis. mitsu lifts hers up as well and is also without panties. they laugh and leave the apartment.}
