<L>__{interior brooklyn court house late afternoon}
<A>__{a huge wooden door slams open. jacob charges through it. he is chasing his lawyer, donald geary, through a crowded court house corridor. geary, sweaty and unshaven, is cradling a coke in one hand, a sandwich and a briefcase in the other. his stomach bounces wildly as he walks.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{geary! mr. geary! listen, goddamn it! you can't just walk away from this.}
<A>__{geary keeps walking. jacob catches up to him.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{who's been talking to you? the army? have they been talking to you, huh?}
<C>__{geary}
<D>__{nobody's been talking to nobody. you don't have a case, you hear me? it's pure and simple. now leave me alone. okay?}
<A>__{jacob grabs the back of geary's jacket and pulls him up short.}
<C>__{geary}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{take your hands off me!}
<A>__{jacob lets go. he stares into geary's eyes.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{listen, will you listen? they're trying to get me. they're comin' out of the walls. the army's done something to me. i need you.}
<C>__{geary}
<D>__{you need ... a doctor.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{a doctor? and what's he gonna do, tell me i'm crazy? they've fucked with my head. i've got to prove it. you've got to do something.}
<A>__{geary gives jacob a pitiful look.}
<C>__{geary}
<D>__{there's nothing i can do.}
<A>__{he turns and walks away. jacob stands there a moment, and then rushes after him. geary is biting into his sandwich. mayonnaise spills onto his hand. he licks it with his tongue. jacob catches up to him.}
<C>__{geary}
<D>__{you mind? i'm eating, huh?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{something's going on here. you're not telling me something. what the hell's gotten into you?}
<C>__{geary}
<D>__{i will tell you what's gotten into me. i don't know you from adam, right? you come to my office with this bizarro story and demand i look into it. okay. i said i'd check it out and i did. now i don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and i don't like it.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{used you?}
<C>__{geary}
<D>__{i talked to the army's bureau of records. you've never even been to viet nam.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what the hell is that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{geary}
<D>__{it means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in thailand.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{war games? thailand? that's not true! how can you believe that? can't you see what they're doing? it's all a lie. we were in da nang, for god's sake. you've got to believe me.}
<C>__{geary}
<D>__{i don't have to do any such thing. i'm eating my lunch, okay?}
<A>__{geary takes a swig of his coke and begins walking away. jacob, enraged, charges after him. with a wild swipe he sends the coke can shooting out of geary's hand. it reverberates down the corridor. geary is stunned.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you slimy bastard! you goddamn piece of shit!}
<A>__{with a powerful thrust, jacob rips the sandwich from geary's other hand. tossing it on the floor, he grinds his heel in it. tomato and mayonnaise squirt onto geary's shoe. jacob turns away.}
