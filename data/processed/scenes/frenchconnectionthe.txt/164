<A>__{long view over the hood of doyle's car to the street. we can see the lincoln. the lights of a car appear on the left and come down the street past the lincoln, slowly, like a man looking for a place to park. we can make out, but just barely with the help of the street lights, four people in the car. doyle in close profile, the foreground, picking up a corner of the lincoln in the background. while we are looking in silence, there is a glimmering flow in the far corner, the beginning of approaching headlights again. they grown brighter and doyle's foreground profile turns to watch it come.}

<A>__{russo and mulderig straightening up, leaning close to window to peer out. long view over the hood of doyle's car of the approaching vehicle, which suddenly switches off its lights and turns on its parking blinkers. it comes abreast of the lincoln and stops. the men get out and chase the lincoln. view through windshield at the four men. doyle is now up straight and at the wheel. he's leaning forward, his hand on the key of the car. he glances back to mulderig.}

<D>__{let's him 'em.}
<A>__{view of the hood. all hell breaks loose, headlights, including doyle's flash on and form a spotlight on the lincoln and the figures around it. frozen in the headlights, confused, startled, and disbelieving are five puerto ricans with a variety of auto stripping tools in their hands: lug wrenches, tire irons, pinch bars, monkey wrenches, etc. doyle drives right up to them. the camera leaps out of the car with him and runs toward the men. we hear voices shouting.}
