<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{close on a steaming soup kettle, resting on a woodstove. a woman's hand stirs with a wooden ladle. pull back to see... helen chambers, slender and strong and keen. she is not yet 60. a code of fairness and self reliance is written on the fine boned features.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{i drove from the lighthouse to my mother's place. i brought her some groceries.}
<A>__{beyond the window, snow falls more heavily than ever. silent. spellbinding.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{your father thought that heavy snow was god's kindness. despite the hardship, it brought us beauty...}
<A>__{ishmael at the rustic table. watching her back.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{...and reminded us. of our place in things.}
<A>__{softer. not bitter, but regretful that...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you don't believe in god anymore.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, ma. we just don't pretend we know.}
<A>__{she begins ladling the soup into big porcelain bowls.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{we don't know god, we feel him. you felt him as a child. i remember.}
<A>__{and turns. looks at him.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{that's a long time ago. what a child feels...that's different.}
<A>__{she studies him silently for a moment. then brings the bowls to the table...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{spend the night, will you? don't go back out into all that snow.}
<A>__{sets them down.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{i felt milholland's report in my pocket. and wondered why i wasn't telling her. telling someone. what i'd found.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you've been busy with that trial, i suppose. such a travesty...}
<A>__{she takes her seat. as he watches her.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{they only arrested that poor soul because he's japanese.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{seattle boys think he's guilty. they say the evidence is rock solid.}
<A>__{she begins to eat. eyes on her bowl.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{they're not his neighbor, like you are. he is a husband, a father, he risked his life for their country. the same as you.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{those aren't the facts that matter.}
<A>__{she looks up. straight to his eyes.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{well, folks are pretty cold. and folks who believe in nothing else...they're cold, too.}
<A>__{no mistaking her meaning. he swallows. uneasy as always, in the path of her disapproval.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i've tried to understand your unhappiness, all these years. having gone to war, losing your arm...}
<A>__{the directness of her gaze. he can't turn from that.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{but other boys came back. and pushed on. they found girls, and married, had babies...}
<A>__{he doesn't flinch. his voice too quiet with...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{someday i will get lucky, too.}
<A>__{too quiet to conceal the hurt. she thinks it is hurt she has caused. it changes her tone to a plea...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{your father fought at belleau wood, it took him years to get over it. nightmares, tears, b...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{...but he found you.}
<A>__{their eyes locked.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{it isn't the war, ishmael. all those years growing up. you never had a real girl of your own.}
<A>__{and now he looks down. he sees that his fist is tight around the handle of his spoon.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{and i know you have it in you to love. i know that much. i wish i knew more.}
<A>__{his fingers open, and the spoon clatters softly on the wood.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{i will stay tonight. thanks for asking.}
