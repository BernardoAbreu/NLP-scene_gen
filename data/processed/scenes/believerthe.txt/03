<A>__{danny walking home alone. he sees two kids (older, tougher, blonder) coming toward him. he slips off his yarmulke and slants across the street. the kids slant that way. he hears a rumbling, looks up at an elevated train entering a station. he runs up the steps toward the shrieking train....}

<A>__{title: 13 years later the train passes above used car lots, discount furniture stores, residential side streets...finally pulls into a station. the doors open. people file on, the camera letting them go by until it spots a tall, thin college student in a yarmulke. danny grown up? pan with him as he sits, opens an organic chemistry texterior the doors close. the train starts up, but the jewish boy hardly notices; he is already reading. he sways with the motion of the car, half hidden by other passengers. we realize he is being watched. reverse angle: another young man, standing a "suede head" (his hair cut so short it's like a fine fabric). suede head's pov: the jewish boy pushes his glasses back up his nose, wipes the nose with a handkerchief, puts the handkerchief away, and all the time his eyes have not left the page. suede head steps between passengers and stands directly over the jewish boy. he looks down at the yarmulke pinned to the stiff, wavy hair, at the oversized shirt collar, scrawny neck, prominent adam's apple, pimples, dandruff, ingrown facial hair... he steps closer, crowding the boy's knees. the boy shifts a little without looking up. subtly but relentlessly, suede head pursues him along the bench until, unable to slide farther, the boy flattens his legs against the seat. suede head presses into the boy's knees. the boy accidentally bumps a businessman to suede head's left. the man (late 30s, wall street journal, african american) looks from the boy to suede head and understands at once what is going on. suede head stares right back and the businessman returns to his paper. suede head eases him aside and steps on the boy's shoe. shoes a heavy black boot pins a brown wingtip to the floor the wingtip wiggles back and forth, finally working free. the boy still hasn't looked up. suede head & the jewish boy swaying, locked in a strange, silent intimacy. suede head forces the boy into ever more contorted postures, increasingly ridiculous denials of what is happening. and the boy not only never stops reading the chemistry text, he keeps highlighting relevant passages. the train slows. the boy closes the book, caps the highlighter, gathers his things and manages to stand up, wriggling awkwardly around suede head. the doors open, he gets off.}
