<A>__{fred takes the revolver out of his shirt and puts it under the pillow on the bed. he sits on the edge of the bed. he takes a cigarette from a pack in his shirt pocket and lights it with a match from a book of "lost highway hotel" matches. fred smokes the cigarette, listening to the wind blow. lightning cracks outside the window. fred crushes the cigarette out in the ashtray on the bedside table. as the last of the blue smoke drifts away, fred falls back on the bed. fred closes his eyes.}
