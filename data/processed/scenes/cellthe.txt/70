<A>__{young stargher is at the sink washing dishes, an anxious eye on the clock.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{need some help?}
<A>__{as catherine enters the claustrophobic house, the boy hesitantly pushes a towel toward her, but doesn't look. she reaches the counter and starts to dry, much to young stargher's relief. as he washes, catherine hands him a mirror locket just like edward's.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{carl, i want to give you a present.}
<A>__{he's hypnotized by the thing, his eyes lighting up.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{if you need me, or if you feel that i'm around but can't find me, just shine it, like this.}
<A>__{she shines reflected light onto the walls. carl hands catherine the wet plate and takes the locket. the dish slips from her fingers and shatters on the floor. the boy's eyes fill with dread. the kitchen clock reads 5:30. he pushes catherine toward a broom closet and shoves her inside.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{what's wrong honey?}
<A>__{with a finger to his lips, he pockets the locket and shuts the door. from within the closet, she watches the terrified child through a crack in the door. in the kitchen, young stargher desperately tries to hide the broken plate. startlingly, his father, martin stargher, is already in the room. cruel, imposing, manipulative man.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{what did you do know? you make a mess? i hate a mess.}
<A>__{young stargher backs into a corner, fearing what will come.}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{don't lie, now, carl.}
<A>__{in the closet, catherine pushes, but the door won't budge. she pounds. in the kitchen, we hear no sound.}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{remember what i said about liars? liars will be punished.}
