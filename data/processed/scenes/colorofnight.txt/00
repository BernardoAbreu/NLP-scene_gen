<D>__{i see... i see your reflection over my shoulder... i see... there is nothing much that i really like... i think i prefer the view outside actually...}
<A>__{during this last reply, bill, standing up, is fidgeting with something on his desk. at michelle's last words, he turns toward her, looking alarmed. but he doesn't have time to do prevent her from breaking through the glass pane and jumping outside. he yells michelle twice. a street in new york exterior day we see michelle's body falling all the way down. capa's office must be around the 25th floor. the body crashes on the street. a police horse, who was near the impact, rears up in fright. as if the asphalt were translucent, we see michelle's body from underneath, with the blood flowing around it.}
<C>__{several voices}
<D>__{all right, get back there... stay back !... get back in your car... stop it...}

<C>__{bill}
<D>__{christ, ed. it was like a vibration of color broadcast from hell. and then the red started to fade away.}
<A>__{the ophthalmologist moves the device away. we see bill's face, and behind him, projected on the wall, an abstract drawing made of colored spots close together. the red spots start to blink and then they become grey. larry's place interior day it is the apartment of an old new york intellectual. a bit messy. a old earth globe on a stand. objects and books everywhere, but with an warm atmosphere. larry wears an open shirt and a sweater. bill also is in open shirt, with a sleeveless sweater. at the beginning of the scene, bill is lying on a couch.}
<C>__{larry}

<D>__{starts to stand up. sure. you always thought i was a cold hearted son of a bitch.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{not really, but there is a kind of arrogance here.}
<A>__{bill laughs.}
<D>__{do you really believe that you're responsible for her illness. you were a small recent part of her life.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{yes, that's right, that's right. but it's all too fucking glib for me, larry. i cannot dispose of this woman that easily.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{well, you always were a romantic. are you involved with anyone else ?}
<A>__{larry starts to make tea in a corner of the room. bill is seated on an armchair during the following reply, and strokes the grey cat who is lying on the table.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{no. i am still a romantic. i just don't have anybody to be romantic with. they want to fuck me or marry me... none of them want to love me}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{maybe you don't want to be loved. you had a happy marriage once.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{she loved me to death. then she ran off and loved somebody else to death.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{of course, there is something else here. to deny red is to deny emotion.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{oh yeah !}

<A>__{bill stands up.}
<C>__{bill}

<C>__{sondra}
<A>__{she is crying.}
<D>__{what are you saying ?}
<C>__{casey}
<D>__{i'm saying, sondra, that you really, really have to hate a person to stab him that many times. you're a shrink, right ? you know what kind of power people hand over a shrink. or maybe sometimes, they hand even more than they want to.}
<C>__{clark}
<D>__{that is absolutely correct... a thief would not stick around and stab someone thirty times.}

<D>__{no... i can't do that... not right now...}
<C>__{sondra}
<D>__{why ?...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{one reason is that i am more screwed up than you people are.}
<C>__{casey}
<D>__{i was just being obnoxious, and loud before. anybody has a fucking xanax ?}
<C>__{sondra}
<D>__{i have a librium...}

<A>__{he stops. he seems ready to cry.}
<D>__{but the truth is : you are the people that make this work. i would be more than happy to try to find someone for you to continue this, but i cannot help you.}
<C>__{clark}
<D>__{if my opinion counts for anything, i would like to ask : why it is you feel so inadequate for the task.}
<A>__{buck comes and sits next to clark.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{maybe he just don't like us.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{no, that's not it, buck.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{why don't you step on something?}
<C>__{clark}
<D>__{you stop.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{six weeks ago, i spoke harshly to a patient. and she committed suicide... right in front of me.}
<A>__{clark puts his handkerchief on his lips.}
<D>__{perhaps she would have done this, anyway. that's what my colleagues say... but i don't know...}
<C>__{sondra}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry.}
<C>__{bill}

<A>__{she gets up and sniffs a bit.}
<D>__{i gotta go. i gotta get the door.}
<A>__{she goes to the front door and opens it to a very muscular young man wearing a sleeveless t shirt.}
<D>__{this is my trainer, chris.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{chris just nods his head.}
<D>__{bye bye.}
<A>__{bill gets out. as soon as the door is closes, sondra literally jumps in chris' arms, and starts giggling.}
<C>__{sondra}
<D>__{i don't feel like lifting weights today.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{sondra}
<D>__{let's do something else.}
<A>__{she bursts laughing.}
<D>__{through the low window, we see bill going down the stairs to the}
<A>__{street. he stops for two seconds to look at the tender couple ! dale's workshop parking exterior day bob's car stops in front of a slightly dilapidated building, on a desert parking lot. the building could be an old factory reconverted by dale into a workshop to make his furniture. a very high chimney above the building.}
<D>__{bill, dressed in jeans and light colored shirt, gets out of the}
<A>__{car and walks toward the building. he passes a board that indicates the location of the office. he knocks at a door with a window and a grating and a sign that says beware of the dog. the dog starts barking. bill knocks again. he tries to look through the door window. the dog keeps on barking.}
<D>__{bill comes back the way he came toward the office. he stops in}
<A>__{front of a window and bends to try to see something inside. he knocks on the window. he turns around, and we catch a quick glimpse of someone behind the window.}
<D>__{bill comes back to the parking lot toward a pickup that two men}
<A>__{are unloading.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{hey! is this dale dexter's shop here?}
<A>__{one of the men nods and shows the main door to bill. dale's workshop interior day entrance of the workshop. the door opens and bill appears. he takes off his sunglasses, puts them in the pocket of his shirt and gets in.}
<D>__{the workshop has a very high ceiling and looks a bit dilapidated.}
<A>__{on the roof of a small structure (perhaps the quoted office) sits the impressive statue of a lion who gives the impression to watch bill.}
<D>__{bill keeps on walking and passes a spray of burning sparks.}
<A>__{someone must be using a blowtorch in the neighborhood.}
<D>__{bill looks around him, looking a bit anxious. several men are}
<A>__{working. he approaches one of them, wearing a sleeveless t shirt, and who is welding, with a protection mask covering his face.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{the man stands up and puts down the piece he was welding. he raises his mask : it's dale.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{hello. did you go to the house?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{yeah. nobody was home. i would have phoned a...}
<A>__{dale shuts his blowtorch off.}
<D>__{i would have phone ahead, but, uh, i don't have your phone number in our file.}
<C>__{dale}
<A>__{he takes off his mask, then his protection gloves.}
<D>__{no problem. so, uh, did you make up your mind ?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{after dr. niedelmeyer, did richie get another psychiatrist ?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{no. no, we moved.}
<A>__{dale goes around a huge, geometrically shaped, metallic structure.}
<D>__{richie went to school. everything was fine.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well... that's the problem, dale. i look at richie, and i don't see that everything is fine. i see a kid that's on the brink.}
<C>__{dale}
<A>__{he starts working on the metallic structure, but stops to look at bill.}
<D>__{a person, uh, gets a bullet in the head. sometimes they just leave it there 'cause... to fuck around in the brain is gonna paralyze the person. that's richie.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what's the bullet ?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{whatever it was, i got him away.}
<A>__{he has taken protection glasses to work.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you want to talk about that ?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{no. i want you to stop trying to tear off the scabs. let the demons rest. you dig around in richie's head, he's gonna blow up in your face.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you think he's violent ?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{not with me.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i think you're making a mistake, dale. this is not the time to take richie out of therapy. if you don't like me, let's get him someone else.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{jesus christ. one of you is the same as another.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{niedelmeyer's residence garden exterior day bill gets out of his car. he is wearing light colored pants, a shirt, and a very elegant leather jacket. he walks up a few steps toward the house.}
<D>__{he crosses the garden, then reaches the very impressive main door}
<A>__{of the house. above the door, two similar faces are carved in the stone. probably doctor niedelmeyer's face.}
<D>__{a small panel opens in the door and edith niedelmeyer's face}
<A>__{appears.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{mrs. niedelmeyer?}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{hi, i'm bill capa. i'm a doctor. i tracked you down through the psychiatric institute.}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{how very enterprising of you.}
<A>__{she slams the panel shut. a few seconds, then she opens the door.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{actually, i was wondering if i could speak to dr. niedelmeyer.}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{my husband died last year. if it makes you feel better, he suffered a lot. well, anyway, it made me feel better.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i'm treating a young man that was a patient... of dr. niedelmeyer's when he was a child. his name is richie dexter.}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{why don't you leave me alone ?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{if i could just ask you a few questions.}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{you get out of here before i call the police !}
<A>__{she angrily slams the door shut.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{just a few questions. mrs. niedelmeyer...}
<C>__{edith}
<A>__{voice over through the door.}
<D>__{get out of here !}
<A>__{bill sighs, then walks away from the door. the camera moves above the door and ends up on a close up of niedelmeyer's carved face, who seems to sneer at bill. bob's office meeting room interior night night is falling on l.a. clark, in the foreground, is counting books. behind him, richie, buck and casey are seated, casey in his favorite hand shaped armchair. sondra is standing up.}
<C>__{clark}
<D>__{fifty eight. now, if i'm not mistaken... last week there were 59 books on the shelf and this week there are only 58 books on the shelf somehow.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{clark... what's the ashtray situation ?}
<A>__{sondra sits down and casey sits in another armchair.}
<C>__{clark}
<D>__{three. not four, as recommended. there are three chairs and five assorted sofas.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{who cares ?}
<C>__{bill}
<A>__{he just came in and is standing by the window. he is wearing his glasses, jeans, open shirt and a light grey jacket. he turns around to speak to the group.}
<D>__{okay, let's get started.}
<C>__{buck}
<A>__{finishing a sentence the beginning of which was not understandable.}
<D>__{... an emotional tar baby.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{today i'd like to focus on a most enlightening... and challenging topic.}
<C>__{sondra}
<A>__{she is a bit lasciviously sprawled in her armchair.}
<D>__{sex.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{more or less. you see, the primary romantic relationship... in our life is often a symptom of our illness.}
<A>__{he has seated himself in the hand shaped armchair.}
<C>__{casey}
<D>__{glad i wore my rubber pants.}
<A>__{buck snickers.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{we keep making the same neurotic choices over and over every time we choose a new mate. so... if you had a magic wand... if you, uh, had a wish list... and could change your partner... sondra, how would you make them different ? what's wrong ? what's missing ?}
<C>__{sondra}
<D>__{now ?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you need a minute to think about it ?}
<C>__{clark}
<D>__{she's totally forgot her rolodex.}
<A>__{casey snickers.}
<D>__{sorry, sorry.}
<C>__{sondra}
<D>__{well, i don't have an attachment in my life right now. the last one sort of went to pieces. if you enjoy sex... a man thinks you're doing it with everybody.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{he was jealous.}
<A>__{he gets ups, walks to a cupboard, opens its door and takes a cup.}
<C>__{sondra}
<D>__{that's right. and i was as good as gold.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well, there's a good chance that he was the one that was sleeping around... and projecting his fantasies and desires onto you.}
<C>__{sondra}
<D>__{this guy had a major projection, and he couldn't keep it in his pants.}
<A>__{the whole group laughs. bill smiles while pouring himself a coffee.}
<C>__{sondra}
<D>__{anyway, i do have this girlfriend. she really makes me laugh. a wish list. i wish... she was a guy.}
<C>__{bill}
<A>__{he comes back with his cup in his hand.}
<D>__{fair enough. casey, what do you got for us?}
<C>__{casey}
<A>__{he is playing with a small statue of a monkey who looks at a skull.. he waits a few seconds, and puts the statue down before speaking.}
<D>__{well... i met this girl about a month ago. i've painted every inch of her in detail. she's the best model i've ever seen. completely uninhibited. does whatever i ask no matter how...}
<C>__{buck}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<D>__{i will bet she does.}
<C>__{casey}
<D>__{that's right, buck. see, but this is where the problem comes in. it's what you see beneath the skin... when you study somebody endlessly, the way an artist does. i see a transcendental beauty there... beyond anything i could ever, ever imagine.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{how does this woman feel about you?}
<C>__{casey}
<D>__{she thinks i'm the living end because i've got talent. but, i mean, what's talent ? kick a garbage can... starving artists crawl out, right ? but there's only one, unique her. and, uh, i think it's love, you know ? and, um... i don't know what to do about that.}
<A>__{he is suddenly moved on the verge of tears.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{do you think she loves you ?}
<C>__{casey}
<D>__{no. no.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{do you care, casey ?}
<C>__{casey}
<D>__{i don't know. i don't know.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{he's a romantic. he loves the suffering.}
<C>__{casey}
<D>__{maybe being who i am... i have no choice.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{very good, casey. that's good stuff.}
<C>__{sondra}
<D>__{i agree.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{buck, what do you got?}
<C>__{buck}
<A>__{he jumps.}
<D>__{oh, nothing to talk about, not compared to that.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{it's not a contest.}
<C>__{buck}
<A>__{he lights a cigarette.}
<D>__{hey, yard sale, you want to share the ashtray ?}
<A>__{casey puts his foot on the ashtray to prevent buck from using it.}
<D>__{thanks a lot.}
<A>__{he gets up.}
<D>__{forget it. you want to share something, share the ashtray.}
<A>__{he sits on a small armchair by a glass table with an ashtray on it.}
<D>__{i got something in my life, something new. you know, she's young. auburn hair, 5'5", 105. pretty as hell. i see her on weekends.}
<A>__{he picks up the ashtray and moves to sit in a more comfortable armchair.}
<D>__{i don't think she'd sleep with a man unless she was married to him.}
<C>__{bill}
<A>__{he has taken his glasses off.}
<D>__{anything else you'd like to tell us?}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{she doesn't mind the gray, you know.}
<A>__{bill smiles.}
<D>__{she's fragile... you know ? it's like she's running through my fingers. two people i loved died. i never thought that i could feel anything.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{good, buck. richie. how 'bout you ?}
<C>__{richie}
<A>__{he is playing with the statue of the monkey.}
<D>__{i don't have,really, relationships. i have m my brother.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{okay. you want to talk about him?}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{h he worries a a lot about me. and he l loves me. but l... i wish he didn't... love me so m... so much sometimes. i wish l i had more of a l life.}
<A>__{he puts the statue down and gets up.}
<D>__{and i know that everyone h here thinks that i'm gay... but i'm i'm not. a and i don't want to be.}
<A>__{richie opens the cupboard, takes a can of pepsi and opens it.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what would you like to be ?}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{i'd like t to be a w woman.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{have you seen a doctor ?}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{so the next step is the chop.}
<C>__{bill}
<A>__{he cuts him very curtly.}
<D>__{thank you, buck. anything else you'd like to tell us, richie ?}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{very good. hi, clark. what would you change about your partner ?}

<A>__{he is manicuring with his handkerchief.}
<D>__{um, i think i will pass... today.}
<C>__{sondra}
<D>__{excuse me. you think you're gonna pass today ? don't you think that's kind of a betrayal to the rest of the group ? i mean, we're all sitting here sharing our most intimate thoughts... and you're just gonna pass today ?}
<C>__{clark}
<D>__{well, sondra, i have my little problems... but i don't s see how it's your business...}
<C>__{sondra}
<D>__{your "little problems" ?}

<C>__{sondra}
<D>__{ah, i see. you're smiling. is that a smile ? you think this is funny ?}
<A>__{she gets up from her armchair.}
<D>__{look at you. just look at you. look at your hair.}
<A>__{buck snickers.}
<D>__{who do you think you are ? huh ? you think you're god's gift to women ? let me tell you something. you are nothing. nothing but a shallow, rigid... self protective, anal coward ! and i will tell you what your little fucking problems are...}

<D>__{come on !... hey, right here !... hit it !}
<A>__{bob's car arrives in the street. the children moves away to let it pass. while bill is parking the car, we hear, in voice over, the beginning of the conversation between bill and clark. bill is wearing a light colored shirt and beige pants.}
<C>__{clark}
<A>__{voice over.}
<D>__{so pretty soon the relevant numbers weren't enough. i had to know all the irrelevant numbers... like the numbers of pages in each deposition.}
<A>__{clark's residence sitting room interior day walls are white, furniture modern, but with good taste. everything is meticulously clean and tidy. bill sits in an armchair. clark is standing by the window.}

<A>__{honking.}
<D>__{without warning, bill turns on a side street on his right, and}
<A>__{gets honked by the other cars. in spite of the very dangerous driving of bill among the other cars, the red car keeps on following him.}
<D>__{to follow bill, the red car must take a vey sharp left turn, and}
<A>__{bumps into a pickup truck full of kits and gears which fall on the pavement.}
<D>__{the chase goes on. the red car is dented everywhere. it catches}
<A>__{up with bill, overtakes him, and bumps violently into bill's car right side.}

<D>__{fuck you !}
<A>__{the red car hits him on the right side twice in a row.}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<A>__{bill hits the red car on its left side and remains stuck to it. they move together, and bill tries to bring the red car as close to the curb as possible.}
<D>__{get the... you... ohh! get the fuck...}
<A>__{the red car is so close to the curb that it snatches away the open door of a parked car, and then knocks down the shopping caddie of a woman. fortunately, the woman is able to move away, but all her shopping items are scattered on the pavement. the two car bump again into each other and arrive into a main road.}
<D>__{when the red car wants to hit bill's car again, bill stands on}
<A>__{the brake and the red car hits a big truck carrying cars. the truck honks and start zigzagging in the traffic. the last car on the upper bridge of the truck gets loose and falls on the road. bill barely avoids it. another car gets loose from the truck and causes a pile up on the road.}

<D>__{hey! you wanna die ! huh ? you wanna die ?}
<A>__{we see the driver of the train working madly on his brake, and looking to the red car with terror in his eyes.}
<D>__{just before the train reaches the crossing, bill jumps his car}
<A>__{forward and the red car quickly moves backward.}
<D>__{bill stops a few feet after the crossing to get his breath back.}
<A>__{we see the train moving behind him. mexican bar exterior night a mexican bar, where hector is a regular. the first shot shows two hands playing the harp. then we get a larger shot and we see hector and bill talking together. bill is carrying his jacket on his arm, and hector is wearing his necktie very loose.}

<C>__{bill}
<D>__{rose. come on.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{rose's head stands up : she is gone back being rose.}
<D>__{and then i met you and the fog... started to lift.}
<A>__{bill takes off the other nail.}
<D>__{it did. it did.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i know. come on, let's go.}
<A>__{he helps her to stand up, and then to walk.}
<D>__{let's go. here we go. come on. shh. come here.}
<A>__{they start going down to the workshop.}
<D>__{here we go. here we go. let's move.}
<A>__{we hear the sound of a nail gun, and a nail clicks on a piece of metal near them.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{oh !}
<A>__{several nail gun shots. nails are getting stuck in the various wooden objects around them.}
<C>__{dale}
<A>__{shot from behind dale. he holds a nail gun and keeps on shooting nails.}
<D>__{back up!}
<A>__{he sticks a nail in bill's shirt. bill remains nailed against a carved wooden panel.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{she yells and holds bill tightly.}
<D>__{no ! no, dale, don't !}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{get back ! get back !}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{dale, no !}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{quick tongue, slow wit. deadly, doctor.}
<A>__{bill tries to take the nail off. the nail must have gone through his flesh, because there is blood on his shirt.}
<D>__{deadly.}
<A>__{dale raises his nail gun slowly, but hector appears from behind a wall, holding a real gun.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{hi, dale. you fucking daffodil. put that toy down. put it in the toolbox. now ! i got .45 caliber nails in this gun !}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what are you doing here, martinez ?}
<C>__{hector}
<A>__{he talks to bill who is behind him, but without taking his eyes away from dale.}
<D>__{aren't you glad i'm here ? anderson snitched you out ! that's what happens when you try to outsmart a cop ! let that be your psych lesson for the day !}
<A>__{at the end of his sentence, hector slightly turns his head toward bill. immediately dale shoots him. hector bends down a little because of the pain, and stands back up to shoot dale. but dale is faster than him and nails both of his hands against the wood panel.}
<C>__{hector}
<A>__{he yells.}
<D>__{go ! run !}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{go ! get over there ! get over there !}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{no ! no !}
<A>__{dale keeps on shooting and sticks several nails in hector's fingers.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{go ! run ! run ! run ! run ! go !}
<A>__{bill succeeds in getting the nail off his arm. he runs away with rose.}
<D>__{we follows them through the workshop. as they reach a staircase,}
<A>__{we hear an engine starting. then a whole block of shelves falls in front of them. we see dale in a small glass cabin, his hands on the controls of a handling machine.}
<D>__{bill moves rose away from him...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{let's go!}
<A>__{... just as a huge piece of furniture falls on bill, who falls down, stuck under the furniture.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{no ! get out !}
<A>__{dale appears behind bill, and wraps a leather belt around his neck. he tightens the belt. bill suffocates. dale pulls him by the belt across the workshop.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{come on ! come on !}
<A>__{he puts him inside a metal cage. he ties the belt on the top of the cage. bill tries, with both hands to move the belt away from his throat.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you fucking son of a bitch !}
<A>__{dale takes a small electric saw, switches it on and tests it on the bars of the cage. sparks spring up.}
<D>__{you really fucked it up, didn't ya ? got your little brother killed.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{no !}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you let old niedelmeyer do it to him.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{no, i saved him !}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you knew what was happening...}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i didn't know !}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{because it happened to you before !}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{would you goddamn shut up ?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{could have saved your little brother, but he killed himself.}
<C>__{dale}
<A>__{he is getting angry.}
<D>__{shut up ! shut the fuck up !}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you failed, dale. and you made rose become richie !}
<C>__{dale}
<A>__{he calms down and smiles.}
<D>__{oh, you're smart. you're really smart. bob moore was smart, but i put a stop to that.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{yeah, you did.}
<A>__{he coughs.}
<D>__{why'd you kill casey, dale?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{why are you head shrinkers all alike, huh ? y you can't keep your fucking hands off of us. huh ? always pokin' and pushin'. huh ?}
<A>__{while talking, he keeps on switching his saw on and off.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{why'd you do it, dale ?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{because... that little bitch, rose, she started sneaking out... playing like bonnie, modeling for him night after night. christ, bill, he was lookin' right through her... gonna recognize richie in group. well, i might have missed old niedelmeyer... but i sure as hell got bob... real good. and now...}
<A>__{he starts his saw. sparks spring up on the edge of the cage.}
<D>__{i'm gonna cut you into little pieces and sand the skin off.}
<C>__{bill}
<A>__{he snickers.}
<D>__{the inspiration of madness, dale.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{the tyranny of normalcy, bill.}
<A>__{he starts his saw again, and slowly moves it close to bill. we hear the sound of the nail gun and a nail gets stuck in dale's shoulder. the saw stops. dale walks back a few steps to face rose, holding the nail gun pointed on him.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{richie.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{my name is... my name is rose.}
<A>__{he rushes on her. she shoots and sticks a nail in the middle of his forehead. dale falls down. rose starts screaming.}
<D>__{no ! no !}
<A>__{bill tries to get the belt off his neck. rose raises the gun to her throat, and presses the trigger. but it doesn't work. she tries again. it still doesn't work. the gun must be empty.}
<D>__{no !}
<A>__{bill eventually succeeds in getting free, but rose, after she has thrown the gun away, starts running through the workshop.}
<D>__{no !}
<C>__{bill}
<A>__{he runs after her.}
<D>__{rose ! rose ! come back ! rose !}
<A>__{dale's workshop chimney exterior night rose starts climbing the ladder mounted on the body of the chimney. bill follows her and yells.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{rose ! rose ! stop ! rose !}
<A>__{rain is soaking both of them, but they keep on climbing. thunder is rumbling.}
<D>__{a long distance shot shows the whole chimney, with rose and bill}
<A>__{climbing on it.}
<D>__{wait ! rose!}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{she sobs.}
<D>__{don't !}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{for god's sakes, don't jump ! rose !}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{she has reached the circular platform on the top of the chimney. she yells.}
<D>__{no !}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{rose ! stop !}
<C>__{bill}
<A>__{he reaches the platform.}
<D>__{no ! no. no !}

<D>__{wait !}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{why ?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{rose ! no ! stop, please !}
<A>__{rose jumps on the very narrow ring which circles the platform.}
<D>__{just stay there !}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{it's too late. i've gone too far. i can't go back.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{if you go, i go ! i swear to god ! i swear to god.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{why would you do that ?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{please, god, just come over here. i don't want you to die. just give me your hand. take a risk ! there's no risk in dying. come on.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{oh, capa.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{come on.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{she puts her hand out to bill's strutted hand. we hear the sound of a high gust of wind, and rose looses her balance and starts falling backward.}
<D>__{l... no...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{no !}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{capa !}
<A>__{she yells.}
<D>__{no !}
<A>__{bill jumps from the platform and catches a chain hanging under the platform. his momentum makes him swing and he catches rose's arm just as she was falling from the outer ring. with his other arm he holds on the chain and they start swinging back and forth. they eventually reach the chimney ladder. rose grabs one of the rungs, followed by bill, who pushes her up.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{they move back to the platform, and, as soon as they reach it, they hug each other very tight. bill looks at the beacon on the top of the chimney. from white, the beacon becomes red, which is its real color. bill smiles : he sees red again. he hugs rose even more tightly.}
<C>__{hector's voice}
<A>__{while the camera pans away from the platfom, showing the whole platform with bill and rose holding each other, we hear hector's voice.}
<D>__{hey! listen up, you fucking daffodils ! you gonna leave me hanging here all night, huh ?}
<A>__{bill starts laughing.}
<D>__{get me down, you goddamn cuckoos ! get me some fucking band aids !}
<A>__{bill keeps on laughing. rose starts laughing too.}
<D>__{come on, you fucking daffodils ! get me out of here !}
