<D>__{i hadn't told anyone everything that was running through my mind about what might happen in london. there were a lot of possibilities i didn't want to talk to anyone about. ideas best kept to myself. what no one told me was that when we bought the skag, some lucky punter would have to try it out. begbie didn't trust spud and sick boy was too careful these days, so i rolled up my sleeve and did what had to be done.}
