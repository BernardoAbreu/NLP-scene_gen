<B>__{body of evidence}
<A>__{by brad mirman (second draft) over the black we hear the sounds of two people making love. a man's voice moans passionately.}
<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{andrew marsh lies on his back in bed. he is a frail looking man in his early sixties, with thinning gray hair. on top of him is a much younger woman. although her back is to us, we catch flashes of her face for a moment as she turns from side to side. we see enough to know that this is a beautiful woman. she moves wildly, grinding her hips into him, her head arched back, her hands rubbing lightly over her breasts. she reaches down, grabbing his hips and jerks them upwards, forcing him deeper inside her. they move together faster and faster. the camera slowly begins to pull back. as it does we see what we are watching is on a television. further back still. we see two uniformed police officers standing before the television watching the act. the camera begins to pan around the room. rain streaks down the windows of the room lightning flashes outside. a video camera is set up on a tripod. more plain clothes police, looking, dusting, talking. we continue to pan. we can now see it is the same room on the tape. on the bed lies the naked body of andrew marsh, a sheet covering his lower torso. his face is ashen, mouth open, his dull eyes looking out in a fixed stare. the last instant of his life is etched upon a face frozen in pain.}
<L>__{exterior residential street night}
<A>__{lightning fills the night sky. thunder booms overhead. the wind whips the rain furiously against anything in its path. the camera moves slowly along rows of beautiful homes. at the end is a cul de sac. several police cars are in the driveway, their red lights flashing. a four door sedan pulls into the driveway. john cardenas steps out into the rain. he is a handsome latin in his thirties, with hard, chiseled features and black, slicked backed hair. he does not run through the rain he walks. detective reese, a man who looks more like an accountant than a homicide detective runs out to meet him.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{is it marsh?}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{just a hint of sadness shows on cardenas' face. it lasts an instant, then it's gone.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{sir, do you mind if we get out of the rain?}
<A>__{cardenas doesn't move. he ignores the question.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{who found him?}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{his secretary. joanne braslow.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{she was here?}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{no. she stopped by to pick up some papers.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{show me.}
<A>__{reese starts for the house. cardenas looks up into the night sky. a flash of lightning fills the screen.}
<L>__{interior house, bedroom close on camera night}
<A>__{pull back to reveal a police photographer snapping pictures of marsh in bed. cardenas enters followed by reese. he moves through the forensic and medical teams. anything cardenas feels about the gruesome sight before him is hidden behind a mask of indifference. standing by the bed is assistant district attorney, roger troxell, a short, baby faced man. cardenas looks down at the body, then over at the medical examiner, dr. henry mccurdy, a portly man with windblown cheeks and bloodshot eyes.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{how long?}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{about three hours.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{cause?}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{not sure. i will have everything you need tomorrow.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{take a look at this.}
<A>__{reese points to the nightstand drawer and troxell opens it. on top of the nightstand is a box of tissues and a bottle of nasal spray. inside are ropes, handcuffs and an assortment of sexual}
<B>__{aides.}
<C>__{troxell}
<D>__{this guy was into some kinky shit.}
<A>__{cardenas looks at the various sexual devices, then walks out of the room.}
<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{joanne braslow sits on chair. her eyes are tired red from crying. she is mid thirties attractive, but her looks come more from effort than nature expensive hair cut the right cosmetics. she has a corporate look to her. cardenas steps into the hall and walks over to her.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{miss braslow i'm district attorney john cardenas. you arrived at what time tonight?}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{a little after eleven.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{why did you come by?}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{i had some papers to pick up.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{do you know who mr. marsh was with?}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{i assume his girlfriend.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{her name?}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{rebecca lawson.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{you wouldn't know her address, would you?}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{no but i can get it for you.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{thank you.}
<L>__{interior hallway, city hall building day}
<A>__{cardenas walks down the corridor with mccurdy.}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{marsh wasn't alone. we found traces of sperm on the sheets. the toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what'd he die of?}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{the official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{the official cause?}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{that's what my report will read.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{but there's more?}
<A>__{they reach a door and stop.}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{it's speculative at this pointerior marsh had advanced arterial disease. his heart attack was induced by excessive aerobic activity in conjunction with the drug.}
<A>__{mccurdy enters the room. cardenas thinks for a moment, then follows.}
<L>__{interior cardenas' office day}
<A>__{spacious and sparsely furnished. the walls are empty. no commendations, plaques or photographs to add prestige to the office. cardenas steps into the room and looks at mccurdy who is already seated next to reese and troxell.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<P>__{(to mccurdy)}
<D>__{what are you saying, henry? that his girlfriend fucked him to death?}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{a trace of a grin shows on cardenas' face. he walks over to the window and stares outside. reese, troxell and mccurdy wait as he thinks. a beat. cardenas turns back to the room.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what can we prove?}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{we know marsh had a head cold. we found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand. the coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time. he'd keep using more and more never knowing what he was taking.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{any prints on the nasal spray?}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{marsh's and rebecca lawson's.}
<C>__{troxell}
<D>__{what if he did know what was in it? a lot of users put it in nasal spray bottles so they can use it in public.}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{can we put rebecca lawson at the scene?}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{a man across the street from marsh saw her drive up about four thirty sunday afternoon. and her prints are all over the place.}
<A>__{cardenas stands and walks to a dart board on the wall. he gathers the darts, moves back and tosses one.}
<C>__{troxell}
<D>__{marsh's cardiologist told me that after marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day. does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what did he say about miss lawson?}
<C>__{troxell}
<D>__{he can remember at least one occasion and the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied marsh to the office.}
<A>__{cardenas throws another dart at the board.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{so she knew about his heart?}
<C>__{troxell}
<D>__{had to. i also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with marsh. there's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting miss lawson.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what about the will?}
<C>__{troxell}
<D>__{that's the best part. she gets it all everything.}
<L>__{exterior cemetery morning}
<A>__{gray clouds hang over head. a light drizzle falls. a group of mourners hold umbrellas as they stand around the grave. in the b.g. the press is visible, held back my private security guards. a woman dressed in black stands in the front of the mouners, her face hidden behind a hat and veil. raymond sattler, a tall, distinguished looking man in his sixties stands beside her. he supports his weight with the aid of a cane. the service concludes. sattler along with several other people offer her their condolences. joanne braslow is there. she does not go over to rebecca. cardenas and reese stand off to the side by a large oak tree. cardenas watches and waits. he steps forward as sattler leads the woman by.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{miss lawson?}
<A>__{the woman stops. her back is to cardenas.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{i'm district attorney, john cardenas.}
<A>__{rebecca lawson removes her hat and veil and slowly turns around. she is in her late twenties. a deep pain fills her face controlled, but evident. her eyes are tired heavy from crying but no tears show now. this is a woman whose grief is private and not displayed for others. although emotionally drained she is still stunningly beautiful. so beautiful that even cardenas' usually cool demeanor cannot hide how impressed he is.}
<C>__{sattler}
<D>__{i don't think that this is the time, or the place.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{i just wanted to introduce myself and inform miss lawson that there will be an inquiry.}
<C>__{sattler}
<D>__{an inquiry into what?}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{for starters i'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?}
<C>__{sattler}
<D>__{because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{did i say it was a natural death?}
<A>__{cardenas and rebecca lock eyes. rebecca stares at him genuinely shocked by his accusation. cardenas nods and walks away. in the b.g. we see joanne staring at rebecca with hostility.}
<L>__{interior house, living room night}
<A>__{large and homey. a fire roars in the fireplace. frank dulaney sits on his couch as he goes over some paperwork. he is mid thirties, powerful, self assured. sharon dulaney enters. she is an attractive woman in her early thirties. she kisses him on the cheek then pushes his paperwork aside and sits down on his lap.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{you're on vacation, remember? you're supposed to be relaxing.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i am relaxing.}

<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{if you want me to.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i'm always open to learning new things.}
<A>__{she kisses him soft, gentle kisses. dulaney puts his arms around her and kisses her harder.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i'm beginning to see what you mean. why don't we go upstairs and work on the advanced course?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i can't. i've got to finish a counter offer on the bergman property.}
<A>__{the moment is passing by. a trace of frustration shows on dulaney's face this is obviously not a new occurrence.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{can't it wait?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{no it has to be done by tomorrow.}
<A>__{the moment is gone. dulaney forces an understanding smile. he looks towards the door and sees his eight year old son,}

<D>__{hey, slugger. ready for bed?}
<A>__{michael walks over to this parents.}
<C>__{michael}

<P>__{(hangs up; to sharon)}
<D>__{that was sattler. he thinks the d.a.'s going to file on rebecca lawson. he wants me in the office tomorrow morning.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{we're supposed to go to the lake.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i know. what can i do? he is the boss.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{he could let you have your vacation.}

<D>__{dad is it true what they're saying about that miss lawson lady?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{what are they saying?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the kids at school say she humped mr. marsh to death.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{hey, you know better than that. what did i teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{she allegedly humped him to death?}
<A>__{dulaney grins. sharon is fighting the temptation to laugh.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i swear the both of you.}
<P>__{(to dulaney)}
<D>__{some example you set.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<P>__{(imitating her)}
<D>__{some example you set.}
<A>__{he makes a funny face at michael who laughs and makes one back. dulaney grabs him and starts tickling him. michael screams with laughter as he tries to tickle him back. dulaney then starts tickling sharon michael helps him. sharon roars with laughter and falls to the floor. the three of them roll around laughing hysterically.}
<L>__{interior sattler's office morning}
<A>__{sattler sits on a couch sipping a cup of coffee. dulaney sits across from him.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{andrew marsh was a very wealthy man. a trial like this is going to put cardenas in the spot light.}
<C>__{sattler}
<D>__{we've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten. i'd like you to go with her.}

<D>__{i'm supposed to be on vacation.}
<C>__{sattler}
<D>__{i know but she wants you to represent her if cardenas files.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{sattler}
<D>__{because i told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{raymond, i'm the only criminal attorney you have.}
<C>__{sattler}
<P>__{(jokingly)}
<D>__{well, i guess that makes you the best.}
<P>__{(candidly)}
<D>__{look, frank she stands to inherit three million dollars. as executors of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees for us. all i'm asking you to do is talk to her.}

<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{alright, i will talk to her}
<C>__{sattler}
<D>__{she's waiting in the conference room.}
<A>__{dulaney stands and walks towards the door.}
<C>__{sattler}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you know, i knew andrew marsh for almost twenty years or thought i did. what do you think would make a man in his condition do the things he did?}
<A>__{dulaney stops at the door and looks back.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i think the question is: what is it about her that made him want to do it?}
<L>__{interior conference room day}
<A>__{rebecca is seated at the end of the conference table smoking a cigarette. sunlight flows through a window and highlights her hair. she is dressed in a fashionable business suit that clings to every curve of her body. dulaney enters the room. when he sees her he can't help but stare. rebecca notes his gaze.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{miss lawson, i'm frank dulaney.}

<D>__{there are no charges against you. i'm here to decide if i'm going to represent you should that occur.}

<A>__{rebecca appears hurt by the question.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{you don't waste any time, do you?}
<A>__{dulaney doesn't answer. he studies her his eyes probing hers.}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{do you think i did it?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i don't know. that's why i'm asking you.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{you must have some feeling. some immediate impression. a young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will. and the things that went on in that house. such wild sex. what kind of picture does that paint?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{not a very good one i'm afraid.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{and that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me. that's why i need a very good lawyer, mr. dulaney.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{you're assuming the district attorney is going to file charges.}
<A>__{rebecca's anxiety begins to surface. she feigns a weak smile.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{he'll file. he's an ambitious man. ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{you still haven't answered my question.}
<A>__{she takes a long drag of her cigarette before answering. she looks at dulaney. displaying emotions is not something that comes easily. tears well up in her eyes.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(emotionally)}
<D>__{i loved him. a big part of my life has been torn away from me, mr. dulaney. a part i can never get back and on top of that people are saying that i am somehow responsible for it. they've taken everything that is good and caring about two people in love and made it dirty.}
<A>__{a single tear streams down her check. she knows what he wants to hear her say and she resents having to say it.}

<D>__{why would she want that?}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{because she's clever. because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in marsh's condition would use cocaine.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{suspicions maybe but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{the m.e.'s report stated that marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use. without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning. we would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.}

<D>__{this is a very small town people here have very straight views on sex.}
<C>__{rebecca}

<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{of course we are. our primal urges are still there but we've taken sex and intellectualized it, refined it down to its most essential components. it's bland, easy, mechanical. there's great passion in the struggle such craving in denial. do you know what it's like to yearn for something? i'm not talking about wanting, or needing. i'm talking about an urge so deep that your skin burns and every cell in your body pulses with desire?}

<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{when i was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. so did this family down the road. i used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries. it wasn't easy. the stone walls were high and i'd scrape my knees as i climbed over. on the other side were wild rose bushes. the thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as i lowered myself down.}

<D>__{you all can see the defendant, rebecca lawson. but as this trial proceeds you will see that she is not only the defendant she is the murder weapon itself.}
<P>__{(stops and thinks for a moment)}
<D>__{is that possible? can a person actually be a weapon? the answer is yes. if i hit you and you die i am the cause of your death. but can sex be called a weapon? yes. and what a deadly weapon rebecca lawson made of it. the state will prove that miss lawson seduced andrew marsh that she put increasing sexual demands on him while she secretly administered cocaine. all the while knowing that he had a severe heart condition.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{she is a beautiful woman but when this trial is over you will see her no differently than a gun, or a knife or any other instrument used as a weapon. she is a killer. and the worst kind one who disguised herself as a loving partner.}

<D>__{mr. dulaney?}
<A>__{dulaney stands up and approaches the jury.}

<D>__{i know what you're thinking and it's a mistake. you look at miss lawson and you see a beautiful woman who was involved with an older man and you think she looks like the type. she could've done it. and that's exactly what the district attorney wants you to think. yes, she is beautiful. so what? does that make her a killer? of course not. this case is not about appearances. it's about facts.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{as mr. cardenas presents his case you will see that there are very few facts that the bulk of the states evidence is circumstantial. i'm confident that by the conclusion of this trial you will not just have a reasonable doubt. you will have no doubt at all that rebecca lawson is innocent of the charges against her.}

<D>__{ and if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?}

<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to mr. marsh and then induced him to make love?}

<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{no but it seems highly unlikely that a man in his condition would use cocaine.}

<A>__{her meaning isn't lost on dulaney. she watches him as if studying him then slowly very slowly, she pulls on the belt of her robe. the robe parts revealing the beauty of her body. she gently lowers herself on top of him pressing her breasts against him. dulaney's breathing quickens in excitement. rebecca moves her head to his chest kissing his burns softly while her fingers caress lightly over his stomach. she gradually moves her head down lower and lower.}

<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{no, your honor.}
<C>__{judge burnham}
<D>__{maybe you don't know what it's like where mrs. crawford comes from but i do. i came from a neighborhood just like hers. this is a whole other world for her. she's a poor working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated and mostly unsympathetic people. so, she puts on her best dress, fixes her hair and tries to present herself as intelligently as possible.}

<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{if you want to get your kicks go to a video store and rent a porno movie.}

<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{this tape was recorded over an existing recording.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{over what?}
<A>__{biggs raises a hand signaling patience. snow still fills the tv screen.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{i would have missed it but the phone rang and i let it play while i talked. it looks like blank tape but it isn't. it's been erased without any input signal coming in.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{so, what good is it to us if it's been erased?}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{it's very good because when the d.a's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{because it hasn't all been erased.}
<A>__{biggs looks at the screen. a beat. the snow dissolves and a picture fades in. the picture lasts only about five seconds. we see rebecca from the back as she straddles marsh, grinding up and down on the bed her hair flowing down her back. marsh raises his hand. his wrist is in a cast. she turns her head to the side and as she does we see that it is not rebecca but joanne braslow. the tape clicks off. dulaney stares at the blank screen.}

<C>__{dulaney}

<A>__{joanne can't hold back the emotion that is building.}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{it must have been horrible. having to go there seeing them together knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.}

<D>__{well i think that after the operation she realized that...}
<A>__{it takes dulaney a few seconds to object to the question. he is clearly preoccupied with the implications of roston's testimony.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{objection. the question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{your honor, mr. roston lived with the defendant for many months. i feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the miss lawson.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{the opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view.}
<C>__{judge burnham}
<D>__{objection sustained.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{did miss lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?}
<C>__{dulaney}

<D>__{when you say your sexual relations with miss lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{it was like she was trying to push me as far as she could. she called it opening new doors.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{can you give the court an example?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{it was like sex was a game to her. she got off on the control. she always used to tell me it had to be her way.}
<A>__{this strikes a chord with dulaney.}
<C>__{roston}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what would she do that made it hard to resist?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{she's a woman who is very much aware of her own sexuality. sometimes i felt she could read my mind. it was uncanny how she knew exactly what i wanted. a few nights before my heart surgery rebecca woke me. she had handcuffed me to the bed.}
<A>__{there are a few snickers from the crowd. dulaney is thinking about the familiarity of roston's testimony. judge burnham bangs his gavel. the crowd becomes silent.}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{she told me that tonight we were going to open new doors. i asked her to stop to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what did she say?}
<A>__{roston is clearly uncomfortable having to relate this part of his life.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{mr. roston i know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.}
<C>__{roston}

<A>__{more noise from the crowd. judge burnham is annoyed. he bangs his gavel again.}

<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what did she do next, mr. roston?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{she started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. she reached down and put me inside her. my doctor had warned me about exerting myself but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that. you just think about how beautiful this woman is how much you want her. how deeply you want to please her.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{at first it started off slowly but the rhythm built and built. every time i got close to an orgasm she would stop. eventually i started to have trouble breathing. rebecca just kept going faster and faster. no matter what i said she wouldn't stop. i really thought for a moment i was going to die.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{if you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{i couldn't help myself. you get lost inside a women like her. it was like a drug. it was the best sex i ever had.}

<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{what good does that do it's the old will?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing. since rebecca lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and joanne braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.}

<D>__{ and that mr. marsh paid less attention to you?}

<D>__{ and that he changed his will?}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{yes.}

<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{in his previous will mr. marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars then he cut you out. why do you think he did that?}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{she talked him into it. she wanted everything.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money. that must have made you pretty angry?}

<C>__{dulaney}

<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{dulaney}

<D>__{isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{no! why would i want to kill him?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{because you were jealous. because he cut you out of the will. because you have a cocaine habit to feed because you know that if rebecca lawson is found guilty the new will is void and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored.}

<A>__{as dulaney continues we sense he is applying his closing arguments to himself.}
<C>__{dulaney}

<D>__{here was an exciting young woman who unlocked doors. doors that led into a new world. a world he entered willingly eagerly. he wanted to please her and so, he did not tell her of his illness. i know it might be difficult for you to understand wanting something so badly that you are willing to risk everything but that's what passion does to you. it's a fire uncontrollable. it consumes you and the only thing you can do is let it burn. andrew marsh let it burn. it was his life his choice and maybe his mistake but making love is not a crime.}

<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{it's true we all have fires burning inside us. rebecca lawson was very aware of the fire burning inside andrew marsh and she stoked those flames fanning them until they burned so hot that reason and judgement left him. is making love a crime? of course not but the question isn't as simple as that. rebecca lawson used her seductive qualities to entice andrew marsh. she used sex as a catalyst and cocaine as the terminus. the combination of the two provided the conclusion of a premeditated act.}

<D>__{she asked dr. paley about cocaine. her fingerprints were found on the nasal spray bottle that contained the cocaine and she was the sole beneficiary of andrew marsh's will. she planned it from beginning to end. she knew about his heart. she secretly administered cocaine, then used wild and physically demanding sex to induce a heart attack.}
