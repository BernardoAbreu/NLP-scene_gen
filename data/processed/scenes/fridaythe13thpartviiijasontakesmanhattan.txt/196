<L>__{interior sewer entrance chamber night}
<A>__{as they descend into hell...a massive chamber consisting of tall columns, slimy catacombs and three feet of stagnant water. their alternatives are nil; sean and rennie join hands, wading through the swill, splashing deeper into the labyrinth.}
<B>__{angle up stairs}
<A>__{as the dim streetlight glowing in the above world is eclipsed by jason, making his way down after them.}
<L>__{interior tunnel #1 night}
<A>__{an oval tunnel slanted downward into pitch blackness. dim overhead lights illuminate salt deposits and eery rust formations. rennie and sean appear at the far end, wading from the sewage as the tunnel rises toward us.}
<B>__{tracking shot}
<A>__{as they come forward at a brisk but cautious pace, strangers in a very strange land. angle their feet sloshing through the slime. all is silent until sean's foot trips over a barrel labeled hughes chemical plant. a vaporous green substance oozes out the rusty end of the container, sizzling on the around.}
<B>__{sean and rennie}
<A>__{carefully sidestep it, continuing on. they make it another ten yards when a figure leaps out from an alcove, gripping a huge wrench. rennie's scream echoes through the tunnel.}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{...but it's a middle aged sanitation engineer who lowers the wrench, as frightened as they are.}
<C>__{sanitation engineer}
<D>__{what the hell are you kids doing down here?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{can you help us get out??}
<C>__{sanitation engineer}
<D>__{i sure can and we don't have a minute to waste.}
<A>__{he begins quickly packing up his tools.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{sanitation engineer}
<D>__{toxic waste, son. this sewer floods out with the stuff on the 13th of every month, right at midnight.}
<P>__{(checks watch)}
<D>__{and that's less than ten minutes from now.}
<A>__{rennie looks down the dark tunnels in all directions, swallowing hard.}
<C>__{sanitation engineer}
<D>__{follow me.}
<A>__{he clicks on his high powered flashlight and quickly leads them down:}
