<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior town hall. day.}
<A>__{it is bathed in sunlight. dozens of people stream through the front door for the first trial in pleasantville's history. there is a weird carnival atmosphere in the air.}
<L>__{interior town hall. day.}
<A>__{the place has been transformed from the chamber of commerce meeting hall to a small town courtroom, complete with pews and ceiling fans. the only carry over from its previous configuration is the huge chamber of commerce banner draped across the back wall.}
<B>__{angle. bench.}
<A>__{at the center of the courtroom where the podium used to be is a large, elevated judge's bench with a rotary insignia on the front. big bob sits six or seven feet above the proceedings finally living up to his name. the whole thing is a strange combination of franz kafka and "inherit the wind." big bob bangs the gavel ...}
<B>__{closer.}
<A>__{the undertone begins to quiet down. all of the faces in the pews are black and white. there is a "colored" section in the back for standing room only.}
<B>__{angle. jurors box.}
<A>__{george is seated in the front row of the jury, despite his relationship to one of the defendants. he is dressed impeccably with his rotary pin still gleaming on his lapel. after a moment or two he sneaks a glance toward the back of the room ...}
<B>__{angle. betty.}
<A>__{she stands in the back with the rest of the "colored" faces. betty cranes her head to catch a glimpse of david or mr. johnson. all at once, a hush goes through the crowd.}
<B>__{angle. doorway.}
<A>__{it swings open and david and mr. johnson are led in wearing handcuffs. dan, the police chief (now ballif), shows them to a table in the center of the room directly facing big bob. there is no lawyer present. there is also no prosecutor.}
<B>__{angle. david.}
<A>__{he glances around a little confused. (weird courtroom.) big bob bangs the gavel.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{bud parker and william johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the pleasantville code of conduct and laws of common decency. do you admit that on the night of may 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following forbidden colors to the pleasantville town hall:}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{red, pink, vermillion, puce, chartreuse, umber, blue, aqua, ox blood, green, peach, crimson, yellow, olive and magenta.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{um ... yes i do. where's our lawyer?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{we prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. i don't think a lawyer will be necessary.}
<A>__{there is a murmur and a great deal of nodding amongst the black and white faces. big bob smiles to himself then proceeds.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well it was dark out ...}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{good. do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it was accessible to everyone.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{very well. let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.}
<A>__{he looks directly at them for the first time.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{do you have anything to say in your defense?}
<B>__{shot. defense table.}
<A>__{mr. johnson just looks at david, confused and terrified.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{i didn`t mean to hurt anybody. i just have to paint ... i need to.}
<A>__{he gropes for something else to say, but what else is there? david glances over and sees him sit slowly back in his seat. david rises from his chair.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i think i've got something to say.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{very well ...}
<A>__{david looks out over the audience. after a moment or two, he looks back at big bob.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i think i know why you're doing this. i mean, i understand why you're doing this. i used to feel the same way. i used to want this place to stay just the way it was. i never wanted it to change ...}
<A>__{there is a loud murmur. big bob bangs the gavel.}
<C>__{david }
<P>__{(he smiles slightly)}
<D>__{but nothing stays the same. you get things, and you lose things, and that's the good part and the bad part but you can't have a good part without a bad part.}
<A>__{he turns and sees his mother in the balcony. they lock eyes for a moment. david smiles slightly and continues.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{it's like the basketball team.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(leaning forward)}
<D>__{the basketball team?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{sure. everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.}
<A>__{there's a murmur in the gallery.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{wouldn't it feel better than when they used to win all the time?}
<A>__{there is a louder murmur. big bob looks concerned.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{see, i know you want it to stay "pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like silly ... or sexy ... or dangerous ... or wild ... or brief ...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.}
<P>__{(pointing to the "colored" section)}
<D>__{look at those faces back there. they're no different than you are. they just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{okay that's enough!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i thought i was allowed to defend myself.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{you're not allowed to lie.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'm not lying ... here i will show you.}
<A>__{he turns suddenly toward the jury box.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{mr. simpson ...}
<C>__{mr. simpson}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what color is that hedge of yours?}
<C>__{mr. simpson}
<D>__{green.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{no, not that hedge. the other one.}
<C>__{mr. simpson}
<D>__{the other one?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{the one in your mind. the one that you see on a bright cold morning. the one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.}
<A>__{mr. simpson suddenly looks far away. he gets a kind of dreamy look in his eye.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{what color is that hedge?}
<B>__{close up. mr. simpson.}
<A>__{suddenly and before our eyes, mr. simpson turns to living color. a huge murmur moves through the courtroom. bob bangs the gavel.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i said, that's enough!}
<C>__{various voices from}
<C>__{the audience}
<D>__{"no ... let him finish ... go on ..."}
<A>__{big bob lifts the gavel and is about to bang it when david suddenly turns toward george.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{alright. dad ...}
<B>__{different angle.}
<A>__{there is a louder murmur. big bob just looks at him frozen while david confronts his "father." george straightens up.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(solemn)}
<D>__{yes bud.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{don't you miss her?}
<B>__{close up. george.}
<A>__{he looks at him stunned. big bob bangs the gavel but nobody listens. george just stares at him like he got shot.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i mean, of course you do, but it isn't just the cooking or the cleaning that you miss it's something else, isn't it ...}
<A>__{george swallows. the undertone in the room starts to grow as he glances toward the back of the room.}
<C>__{david }
<P>__{(softer whisper)}
<D>__{maybe you can't even describe it. maybe you only know it when it's gone. maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{you might even call it "love."}
<C>__{big bob}
<P>__{(banging the gavel loudly)}
<D>__{okay, that's it!!!}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(motioning toward the back)}
<D>__{now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?}
<A>__{slowly, almost imperceptibly george nods. a single tear rolls down his cheek. as it traces the side of his face it leaves a long trail of color behind it.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{don't you wish you could tell her that?}
<A>__{he nods again and it all comes out. betty smiles at him through her tears. even mr. johnson smiles as well.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(pounding the gavel)}
<D>__{you're out of order!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{why am i out of order?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{because i will not allow you to turn this courtroom into a circus!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well i don't think it's a circus. and i don't think they do either.}
<A>__{david motions behind him to the black and white section. there are now ten to fifteen "colored" faces.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{this behavior will stop at once.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{but see that's just the pointerior it can't stop at once. because it's in you. and you can't stop something that's in you.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(tightly)}
<D>__{it's not in me.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{oh sure it is.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{no it isn't.}
<A>__{he crosses to the bench looking right up at big bob. he leans over the bench and gets right up in his face.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(smug whisper)}
<D>__{what do you want to do to me right now?}
<A>__{big bob starts to tremble. he shakes with rage as david moves closer.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{c'mon. everyone's turning colors. kids are making out in the street. no one's getting their dinner hell, you could have a flood any minute ... pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...}
<C>__{big bob}
<D>__{that's not going to happen!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{but it could happen.}
<C>__{big bob}
<D>__{no it couldn't!}
<A>__{big bob looks at david and starts to tremble. it starts around the base of his neck, spreads quickly up the rest of his head. after a moment or two, big bob has gone completely}
<B>__{red in the face. wider.}
<A>__{a gasp goes through the courtroom. david looks at him and just smiles. the crowd reaction turns almost to a roar as big bob turns and catches his reflection in the window.}
<B>__{close up. big bob.}
<A>__{he sees the ruddy image staring back at him, then looks down at his hands. they have gone completely red as well. big bob freezes for an instant then bolts from the bench in panic and flees the room flinging open the doors to the courtroom.}
<B>__{angle. doorway.}
<A>__{as big bob flees, he reveals an amazing sight: the town square glistens in living color. the huge lawn is a rich deep green. the sky is a dense opaque blue. dozens of spectators bolt from their seats and rush to the doorway as the crowd moves outside.}
