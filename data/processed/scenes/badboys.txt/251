<A>__{burnett holds the door while lowrey holds francine. she's broken, crying, and giving up the ghost of her past.}
<C>__{francine}
<D>__{it was a birthday party... you know, after hours. just the civilian staff... we were drinking. and everybody. they all had boy friends or their husbands.}
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{so you were alone?}
<C>__{francine}
<D>__{he was so nice to me. he said i was beautiful, too. i guess i wanted to believe him...}
<P>__{(then ashamed, starting to shake)}
<D>__{he took some horrible pictures of me. i don't remember any of it. i'd had too much to drink. i wondered if he'd drugged me. later... he threatened to show them to my boys... my little angels. said he'd pin the pictures up on the grade school bulletin boards for all their classmates to see if i didn't do what he wanted.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{he wanted someone inside the p.d.?}
<C>__{francine}
<D>__{at first, it was about drug busts. dealers under surveillance.}
<C>__{francine }
<D>__{he'd steal from them before we could make the case. and then when the department gave the air conditioning to mr. orona...}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{anything you can tell us about him?}
<C>__{francine}
<D>__{what do you say about someone who rips off drug dealers? a man like that ain't scared of nobody. not the police. not you guys. nobody.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he's the scariest man i ever met.}
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{yeah. but does he still trust what you tell him?}
