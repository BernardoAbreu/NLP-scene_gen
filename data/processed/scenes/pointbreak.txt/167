<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior bell's beach australia day}
<A>__{wall of solid water five stories high crashes straight down in a holocaust of spray... rising up from the ocean to meet a tormented sky, roll the most terrifying waves any surfer has ever seen. they close out, pummeling the ocean floor, casting a shockwave up the shore. surfers gather on the sand, gaze out to sea.}
<D>__{1st surfer jesus almighty, the bloody sand's shakin'.}
<A>__{the beach sounds like a mortar range. johnny passes among the brahs.}
<D>__{2nd surfer totally closed out. it's fuckin' death on a stick.}
<A>__{on bodhi, sitting crosslegged in the sand, arms folded around his knees. he stares pensively out at the waves. his hand reaches out and absently strokes a surfboard lying next to him.}
<C>__{utah }
<D>__{i knew you wouldn't miss the fifty year storm, bodhi.}
<A>__{bodhi smiles, the odd smile of a sportsman who appreciates the cunning of his opponent. utah sits beside his prey and stares at the ocean. bodhi stares with glittering eyes at the heaving ocean before him, face splitting into that feral, death's head grin.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{and i always knew i could count on you, agent utah.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{i'm not fbi anymore.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{you never were...}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{i asked them to give me a couple minutes...}
<A>__{utah calmly glances over his shoulder. bodhi follows johnny's gaze to the cops watching from the road.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{it went bad, brah. real bad.}
<P>__{(smiles inwardly)}
<D>__{i just felt it was time...}
<A>__{a booming roar sounds from the ocean. bodhi just stares at the waves, with awe and perhaps fear.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{time to dance with the universe.}
<P>__{(he turns to utah)}
<D>__{i could never handle a jail cell. you'll do this for me, won't you johnny? haven't i earned this much?}
<A>__{utah doesn't move to stop him as he stands, hefting the longboard. he half smiles, then turns toward the water, and starts walking. he stops. turns around.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{thanks, brah.}
<A>__{bodhi doesn't wait for a reply. he walks to the water's edge, and never looks back. he throws his board into the foam and paddles, the riptide pulling him out. the monsters dwarf his body as they quickly suck him into the trough of the holocaust. utah stands and solemnly waits for the universe to deliver final justice. the cops are running clumsily across the sand, too late to stop bodhi. tyler steps up behind johnny, and puts her hands on his shoulders. bodhi is nothing more than a speck as he shoots across the lip of the colossal wave, carving the board downward an unthinkable forehand blast sends him into a 180 degree slide straight down the enormous face, eyes wild, his mouth opens in a soundless howl bodhi and the outer limits wave are locked for one impossible yet glorious moment in perfect harmony, perfect symmetry, perfect union... there is no fear in his face, only awe as the mountain of water closes out, burying the bodhisattva in a whitewater grave... pieces of broken surfboard explode upward, only to fall back into the raging whiteness and vanish. utah remains pensive, eyes fixed on the riderless surf. tyler lowers her head. a fragment of surfboard washes up onto wet sand. the wind gathers force. johnny finally turns to his woman, curls an arm around her shoulder, gathering her close. tears are streaming down her face as she stares at the sea.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{he rode it all the way.}
<A>__{camera pulls back and up, rising high above their heads as the liquid vertical walls continue to hammer the australian shore...}
