<L>__{exterior pier night}
<A>__{johana walks down the pier and notices the little pile of clothes jacques has left behind. she looks around but still can't see anything. she decides to sit next to the pile of clothes, and waits, her eyes riveted to the sea.}
<L>__{exterior pier dawn}
<A>__{the sky has just begun to light up again. johana is still sitting next to the pile of clothes. she is wearing jacques' sweater. she looks sad, yet serene. the look of a woman who has been thinking over the situation and who has made up her mind. tired, jacques swims back to the pier. it looks as if he has come out of nowhere. he is exhausted. he takes off his flippers and gets up onto the pier in front of johana. he looks at her, a little surprised to find her there.}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(warm)}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<A>__{she answers in a far away voice, with the same serene sadness.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{i'm going to leave, jacques.}
<A>__{dripping with water, he sits down next to her. his face is drawn from fatigue. she continues.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{i'm going back home.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{i'm not from the sea... i don't understand what you're talking about.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{yes you do. you know exactly what i'm talking about. you're afraid i want to hold onto you, and i do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{but it's not true, i feel good with you... it feels right...}
<A>__{she looks at him for a moment, then takes his face in her hands and rests it on her bosom, as if a small child.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{i've got to get back to the hotel... and get my suitcase packed.}
