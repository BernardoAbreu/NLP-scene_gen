<L>__{exterior roof on catwoman}
<A>__{watching with amusement as batman's weight causes the hook to dislodge. it skitters across the gravel surface of the roof and catches, at the last instant, on the edge of the cornice which promptly crumbles and gives way. fascinated, the catwoman leans over the edge of the roof and peers down... angle on batman as he falls he flails wildly, tangled in his cape, as the ground rushes up toward him. he gets a last ditch inspiration finds the gas cylinder on his belt and hits the switch. the rods in his cape begin to inflate... six stories up, his batwings spring erect, slowing his plunge. five stories up, an updraft hits him and he suddenly inverts. four stories up, he rights himself. three stories up, he goes into a downward spiral, out of control, gliding in great wide arcs over the street... ...and a moment later there are no stories left. with an ugly crunch, he smacks into the slush covered pavement and bounces. face down, he skids some twenty feet to a halt right in the middle of a busy intersection.}
