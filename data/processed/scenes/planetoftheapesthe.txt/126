<A>__{the cages are no larger than small jail cells. there are four of them. bars, not walls, divide the cages, so that all four are visible. each of the first three cages is occupied by a primitive male. at the moment the first two are quiet dozing or scratching apathetically. the third occupant is stolidly regarding a half dozen brightly colored hollow wooden boxes, or blocks, of varying sizes and proportions on the floor of his cage. he is trying to stack the boxes in such a way as to reach a banana dangling from a cord twelve feet overhead. he has correctly selected the first two large, sturdy blocks for his tower under the banana but the tall third block is too unstable on its small base to support the broad based fourth block.}
