<A>__{redridge stands by the marble fireplace, tossing the books into the fire. the flames flicker and leap around the books as their pages blacken and are consumed by the fire.}
<L>__{interior engineer workshop day}
<A>__{eli watches as the engineer charges the battery with the gas generator, which chugs noisily. he licks his lips, dry as sand. unscrews his canteen to take a drink, but it's down to its last few drips.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{what's this place across the street? they got any water?}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{we got our own underground spring here. only fresh water in a hundred miles if's you can pay for it.}
<A>__{eli thinks a while longer. then stands and stuffs his shotgun inside his pack, shoulders his gear and makes for the door.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i will be back.}
<A>__{eli stops in the doorway and turns back to the engineer.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{if that battery ain't here when i get back, i will use this gun on your kneecaps and i will put this building to the torch and i will watch it burn to the ground with you alive inside it. so help me god.}
<A>__{and with that he turns and leaves. the engineer gulps. not a hint in eli's voice that he didn't mean every word.}
