<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{i loved it. it sounds peculiar, but i loved every minute of it. i did. eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but i felt like i always had a piece of him with me. a little part of his soul inside me. i could feel it. it was alive and kicking.}
<A>__{sandra has accidentally evoked a storm of emotion. she struggles to keep it in check. almost a whisper...}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{i really miss that.}
<A>__{with a few breaths, sandra tries to hold on. hold back.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{don't stop. don't.}
<A>__{a beat, then sandra finally melts. josephine holds her. the two women stand together in the hallway, letting the moment be.}
