<A>__{a middle aged couple are sitting on some lawn furniture trying to read the newspaper. a tennis ball comes down from the sky and hits the guy squarely on the top of the head. pull out to reveal that they're surrounded by dozens of tennis balls.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{one of these days i'm gonna burn thomerson's court to the ground.}
<L>__{exterior the thomerson's medium shot day}
<A>__{rick and mr. thomerson are having a heart to heart chat over some lemonade in front of the tennis court.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{well, i have to admit my game's a little rusty, but i love polo. it's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. really a beautiful experience.}
<C>__{mr. thomerson}
<D>__{rick, i want to cut through the b.s.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{i'd love that.}
<C>__{mr. thomerson}
<P>__{(sitting on his anger)}
<D>__{good. i think you're an asshole. no, let me correct that, an immature asshole. which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and i'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{mr. thomerson, i...}
<C>__{mr. thomerson}
<D>__{let me finish. debbie's an adult. she can do what she wants. but if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. if i may make some suggestions...}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{feel free.}
<C>__{mr. thomerson}
<D>__{first, you're a slob. you have to dress for success. second, your outlook on life...}
<A>__{as mr. thomerson drones on, rick shifts uncomfortably in his chair, focusing his attention on debbie, her mother and her older, cynical cousin, ilene, who are sitting nearby on the rear patio. angle debbie, mrs. thomerson and ilene}
<C>__{mrs. thomerson}
<D>__{i'm using the same caterer for the shower i had for our christmas party last year.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{great, mom.}
<C>__{ilene}
<D>__{if i were you, i'd worry less about the shower and more about rick's bachelor party.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{ilene, why would i want to do that? i trust rick.}
<C>__{ilene}
<D>__{of course you do. i trusted my ex, mel, too. cousin, i can only talk from experience. what do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{ilene, rick promised...}
<C>__{ilene}
<D>__{debbie, don't be naive. men are pigs.}
<C>__{mrs. thomerson}
<P>__{(trying to change the subject)}
<D>__{girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.}
<P>__{(calling to mr. t)}
<D>__{boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?}
<A>__{angle mr. thomerson and rick}
<C>__{mr. thomerson}
<D>__{in a second...}
<P>__{(to rick)}
<D>__{and you're irresponsible. show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{well, sir, that's quite a list. but you're absolutely right. and if i work hard at it, i think i can be a totally changed person by the time we finish lunch...}
<A>__{mr. thomerson rolls his eyes, knowing he's been wasting his breath. he grabs the pitcher of lemonade and rick grabs the tray, which is filled with fresh lemons. they get up at the same time and collide, sending the lemonade all over mr. t., and the lemons bounding over the fence.}
