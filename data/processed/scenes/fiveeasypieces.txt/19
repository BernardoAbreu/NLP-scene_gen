<L>__{interior rayette's living room night}
<T>__{song over:}
<A>__{bobby, seated on the couch, a can of beer in hand, staring morosely across the room, to: a portable stereo, playing the song:}
<C>__{wynette }
<D>__{"and if you love him oh be proud of him for after all, he's just a man..."}
<A>__{rayette dipesto, in a waitress's uniform with a bowl of beer nuts. after placing them on the coffee table in front of him, she leans down and kisses him. challenged by a less than reciprocal response, she kisses him more fervently. as she moves her lips from his ear to his neck, he lifts the can to his mouth and drinks.}
<C>__{wynette }
<D>__{"stand by your man and show the world you love him keep giving all the love you can stand by your man."}
<A>__{the song concludes, and setting aside her ardor for the moment:}
<C>__{rayette}
<P>__{(arky accent)}
<D>__{i'm gonna play it again...}
<A>__{as she starts for the stereo, he takes hold of her hand.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you're not going to play it again.}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{well, lemme play the other side then.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{again, he prevents her from moving to the stereo and pulls her down onto the couch.}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{now quit, bobby. you said you're goin' a help me pick a song.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you said.}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{well, lemme sing the one i picked an' see what you think...}
<P>__{(she sings)}
<D>__{"when there's a fire in your heart break the glass sound the alarm..."}
<A>__{he picks up one of the couch pillows and holds it over his ear.}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{oh, you prick...}
<A>__{she pulls it from his hand.}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{how 'bout if i just cut off your damn water?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i'm too moved by your gentility to speak.}
<A>__{she immediately softens and tries to become more "refined."}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{sugar, you know how i feel about you, don't you? i'm just tryin' to get you to take an interest in my kind a things, an' what i'm tryin' to do with myself...}
<P>__{(bringing her face close to his)}
<D>__{you know, there id'n anything in the world i wouldn't do for you, baby. i started livin' the day i found you, you know that?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you're playing the other side.}
<A>__{very hurt, she sits up and looks away from him. he finishes the beer and holds the can out to her.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{cerveza.}
<C>__{rayette}
<P>__{(grabbing it from him)}
<D>__{serveza yourself!}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{now, now.}
<C>__{rayette}
<P>__{(she stands up)}
<D>__{no, dammit, i would easy.}
<A>__{and, as she turns and goes toward the kitchen:}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{but you heal fast.}
<A>__{through the open door to the kitchen, rayette can be seen opening the refrigerator. she takes out a can of beer and returns to bobby.}
<C>__{rayette}
<P>__{(over the above)}
<D>__{you can play the piano, an' your whole damn family can play on some type a musical instrument. an' all i'm askin' is for you to listen to my singing for one single little second...}
<A>__{she hands him the can and sits back down on the couch.}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{but you think you would? no, you're too damn selfish...}
<A>__{he gestures at the name tag on her dress, and, as we'll find he often does, speaks in the okie arky accent he's learned from working the rigs:}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, ray, an' let's go on out.}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{out where?}
<A>__{she sits down and begins removing the tag.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i don't know, i will holler up elton an' stoney...}
<A>__{she thinks about it, then moves closer to him and begins unbuttoning his workshirt, as:}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{i will go out with you, or i will stay here, and do anything you'd like for me to do... if you'll just do one thing. if you'll tell me that you love me.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you can sing the song.}
<C>__{rayette}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{you know what, you are never satisfied.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{that's right, hand.}
<A>__{the response makes her deeply insecure and she immediately lays her body against his...}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{oh, now, baby...}
<A>__{... and initiates another round of kissing.}
