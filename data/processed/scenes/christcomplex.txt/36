<A>__{louis walks into quinn's room with his black tote bag from earlier. it's obvious he was meeting quinn to go train. he looks through out the room, but quickly realizes quinn is probably with zoey. he slumps down on quinn's bed. anger and hurt is portrayed upon his face.}

<D>__{based on how you are acting this morning i have my doubts. that's not what i meant though. you woke up screaming.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{it was nothing.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{i understand if you don't want to talk about it. i'm just concerned.}
<C>__{zoey}

<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{you don't want to hear about it.}
<A>__{quinn touches her hand.}

<P>__{(starts tearing up)}
<D>__{i showed my mom, and dad...well he got out of prison when i was seventeen. i don't see him anymore. his church, even though they knew he had a problem disowned him. he wouldn't have done that to anna if my mom would have supported him, got him help.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{who do you think is to blame?}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{he tried to get help quinn, he reached out to my mom. i should have protected anna too...i mean }
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{ none of this was your fault.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{i have to protect people. this was out of my control, you quinn...what's going on with you...i have control of that.}
<A>__{quinn looks at zoey. he loves her, but a part of him pities her too.}
