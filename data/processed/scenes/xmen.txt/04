<A>__{kenya 1978 a group of children at play. tribal children who, without the help of the titles, could be from any age. they run through a tiny village of tents, playing. every child holds a long reed like stick and they chase each other playing their version of tag. as each child is tapped, they chase the others. each trying to avoid being "it", though never going far enough away to miss the fun. one girl in particular. a pretty girl of 12, with unusual white hair, is tagged and immediately shunned. she chases kids this way and that, but to no avail. she is not strong enough, nor agile enough, to win. she tumbles and lands on her stick, snapping it. she stands and, when the children see that her stick is broken, they begin to giggle. the giggles become laughter and the laughter becomes a taunt, and before we even realize, the inherent cruelty of children let loose becomes evident. they have now formed a circle, at first avoiding her touch with distance, but now growing tighter with menace. in the unspoken manner of children at prey, the group begins to chant in their native tongue a song we have not heard but sung in a way none too inviting. they begin to poke at her with the reeds, driving her back. the girl now moves to the center of the circle, no longer wishing to tag anyone. one devious child seems to get an idea. he takes his stick and smacks it across her shoulder. she turns to face the child and another swings his stick across her back with a solid thwack. before long, mob rule gives way and all the kids are swinging at her and laughing. it grows to the brink of frenzy, the laughing and the shouting not too unlike the noise of the previous scene. so much so, we may miss the first flake of snow. the children certainly do. it is snowing for a good ten seconds before the last of them stops. by then, the snow is thick as flies and wafting down to melt instantly on the hot african soil that has never seen snow before.}
