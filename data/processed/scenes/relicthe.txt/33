<A>__{several cops go by with tracking dogs. margo looks back at the dogs, increasingly uneasy, almost bumps into... henry and larry. surprisingly, they are alive and well and seated with mrs. beasley outside an office. margo exchanges a look with both boys, remembering them from yesterday. a tentative smile starts but henry and larry don't return it. serious and chastened, they drop their eyes. margo continues on. two cops stand outside the door to the rest room, their backs turned to margo as she approaches.}
