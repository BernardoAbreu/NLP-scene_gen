<L>__{exterior desert day}
<A>__{from a distance we see a humvee sitting alone in the middle of a huge, empty desert. just the humvee, nothing else for miles. we hear the sound of a man making machine gun like noises.}
<C>__{jaeger }
<D>__{at at at at at. at at at at at.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{cu humvee there are three soldiers at the humvee. second lieutenant john epps, who sweeps the horizon with a pair of binoculars. pfc wes hammond, who is behind the wheel looking very bored, and pfc mark jaeger, who is at the humvee's thirty caliber machine gun, making the noises and shooting at phantom troops. when jaeger talks it's with all the swagger of a b movie hero.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{at at at at at. at at at at at.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{what does it look like i'm doing? i'm killing iraqis. at at at at at. at at at at }
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{could you stop, please. you're giving me a headache.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{a headache?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{yeah, a headache. my head hurts. you're making me uncomfortable.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i'm making you uncomfortable. baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three hundred thousand screaming iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you. but me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{yes. yes. that's exactly it. yes.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{jaeger goes right back to playing soldier.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{at at at at at.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{knock it off!}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{don't get pissed at me, just 'cause i want to be ready when this war starts.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{ready for what? what are you supposed to be doing?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i told you, i'm shooting iraqis.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{no you're not.}
<A>__{epps points in the opposite direction that jaeger was 'firing.'}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{the iraqis are that way. those are our troops you're shooting at.}
<A>__{with his binoculars epps looks in the direction jaeger was shooting.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you know what? i think you got schwarzkopf. you did! you got the general right in the ass. now that's good shooting.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{blow me.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{another month in this desert and i might just.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{think we're going to do it? think we're going to war?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{not up to us. up to the iraqis. all they have to do is get out of kuwait.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{we ought to kick their asses anyway. even if they do get out of kuwait we ought to kick their asses.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{i don't think we'll go to war. we shouldn't even be here. this isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict. it should be decided regionally.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{people are suffering.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{people were suffering in afganistan, and we didn't do anything.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{that's 'cause the afganis weren't smart enough to be sitting on top of oil. people suffering is one thing, but when the yuppies aren't going to have enough gas for their bmws it's time to break out the tanks. come on. pack up. we've got a whole lot of nothing to patrol.}
<A>__{as they pack up and get ready to roll on jaeger says almost to himself:}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{we ought to kick their asses. either way we ought to.}
