<L>__{interior old bailey day}
<A>__{judge turpin lurks over the proceedings. he sits, the personification of power, very high at the bench. he glares down a wasted wretch of a boy. the beadle stands next to the boy.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{this is the second time, sir, that you have been brought before this bench. though it is my earnest wish to ever temper justice with mercy, your persistent dedication to a life of crime is an abomination before god and man.}
<A>__{he places a black cloth on his head:}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i therefore sentence you to hang by the neck until you are dead and may the lord have mercy on your soul.}
<A>__{the wretched boy collapses in sobs. the beadle is pleased with the verdict. the judge removes the black cloth and tosses it casually on his desk:}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{this court is adjourned.}
