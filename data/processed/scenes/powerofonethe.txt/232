<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior miner's bar}
<A>__{a crude place where the bar runs the back length of the room and the bare concrete surroundings offer nothing in the way of diversion from the main purpose of being there to drink hard and long. thomas, a harsh, ruddy faced welshman, the school of mines instructor, downs a drink, pours another and looks up at pk.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{are you crazy? to sign on for a year?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{you said i was the best you ever taught, sir.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{and you are, boyo. the absolute best.}
<C>__{thomas }
<D>__{but even the best doesn't survive a year on the bars. down in that damn tube the luck runs out sooner than later. you may be a genius at reading the rock but you ain't no fuckin' fortune teller.}
<A>__{thomas throws back another drink.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{you worked grizzly a year.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{and let me show you what i have to show for it to this day.}
<A>__{he holds up his hand. it shakes noticeably.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{and that's thirteen years after the fact, boyo.}
<A>__{a noise from the doorway turns thomas's attention. he looks over as four huge men enter, drillers, men whose faces and bodies are as hard and massive as the rock they work. one of the men pauses at the door and grabs his head as an enormous jolt of pain runs through it. he shakes it off and follows his friends to a table. thomas looks concerned.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{something wrong?}
<C>__{thomas}
<P>__{(unconvincing)}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{the bartender comes over and puts another shot in front of thomas.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{one double brandy. one...}
<P>__{(derisive)}
<D>__{lemon soda.}
<A>__{he puts the lemon soda in front of pk.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{come on, then.}
<A>__{thomas lifts his glass.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{on being the best damned blaster ever taught by ian thomas. cheers.}
<A>__{thomas and pk clink glasses. thomas knocks his shot back.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{another.}
<A>__{the bartender pours another.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{sure you don't want one?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{i don't like the taste.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{taste? you don't drink for the taste.}
<A>__{he holds out his hand. it is steady now. he fixes pk with a portentous stare. thomas looks over at the table of drillers. the man with the headache is downing one shot after another.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{hell's comin'.}
<A>__{he draws pk's attention to the drillers.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{drillers. he's got a powder pain from breathin' too much of that damn gelignite. the pain's bad enough. mixed with a little alcohol it's fuckin' lethal.}
<A>__{he watches the driller down two more shots of liquor.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{come on. we ain't got much time.}
<A>__{thomas directs pk towards the door.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{the two most dangerous things you'll ever see in your life, boyo: a hangup of rock that won't blast free on first shot and a driller with a powder headache drinkin'.}
<A>__{as they reach the door the behemoth explodes with a roar. he grabs his head and staggers backwards; a mad look comes into his eyes. his three huge frineds rush to grab him. he throws them off as if they were ants. he rips a table out of its bolting to the concrete floor and flings it across the room. the men drinking in the bar, all tough cases, begin to flee. thomas grabs pk whose eyes stare in amazement as the behemoth struggles against his three massive friends and pulls him out of the bar.}
