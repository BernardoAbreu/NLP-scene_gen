<L>__{exterior upper class neighborhood (coral gables) night}
<A>__{staked out around the corner are burnett and lowrey. each is clearly tired of the other. the silence is deadly until julie breaks the silence.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{so where's the coffee and donuts?}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i thought that was the usual menu when cops were on stakeout. a little caffeine for the heart. some sugar coated dough fried in day old grease.}
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{man. will you get off this? you're making me sick.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry, marcus. all these hours on the case, you must miss theresa's home cooking.}
<P>__{(near lowrey's ear)}
<D>__{bet last night she fixed you up something yummy and left it in the microwave for you.}
<A>__{burnett starts to steam.}
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{yeah. somethin' yummy.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i imagine there was something yummy waiting for you when you finally made it to bed }
<C>__{burnett}
<P>__{(wheels)}
<D>__{listen, lady }
<A>__{but burnett's face ignites with headlights at their rear. doors open. lowrey checks the rear view mirror. he sees two private security cops named de souza and towne. they split and approach either side of the unmarked sedan.}
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{oh, man. it's the fuckin' pretend police.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{be nice. after tomorrow we might need 'em for a job reference.}
<A>__{lowrey rolls down his driver's window in time to hear...}
<C>__{towne}
<D>__{well, what do we have back here? looks like we got us two pimps and a hooker.}
<C>__{de souza}
<D>__{hey, fellahs. maybe if she does us both we'll let you leave with your pride intact.}
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{excuse me. one moment.}
<P>__{(rolls up the window)}
<D>__{let's fuck with these bozos.}
<A>__{burnett nods his approval. lowrey lowers the window.}
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{now, where were we?}
<C>__{towne}
<D>__{outta the car. hands where we can see 'em. feet spread.}
<A>__{both hobby cops open the doors for lowrey and burnett respectively. looks pass between them as they step out and assume the positions. and towne starts by frisking burnett's shoulders.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{oh, that's not how you frisk a potential lawbreaker. you gotta start at the waistband. see if he's carrying a piece.}
<A>__{towne stalls a beat, then self consciously goes to burnett's waistband where he feels a }
<C>__{towne}
<D>__{gun!}
<A>__{both hobby cops instantly withdraw, their own pieces drawn and leveled on burnett and lowrey.}
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{whoah. you better watch it, fellahs!}
<P>__{(very slowly)}
<D>__{you know, it would be very bad if you shot and killed two helpless pimps and a call girl... but it would be even worse if you shot two policemen and their witness on a stakeout.}
<A>__{looks pass between the hobby cops.}
<C>__{lowrey}
<P>__{(slowly turns)}
<D>__{now i'm reaching slowly for my shield... very slowly... here it comes... just about got it...}
<P>__{(reveals his badge)}
<D>__{ooh, look at that. it's a detective's shield! all gold and shiny. a smart fellah wouldn't fuck with somebody who had one of these in his pocket. so... let's see. i guess that makes us policemen. and you...}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{not.}
<A>__{he shows his shield. both hobby cops lower their guns, unsure about what's nexterior burnett moves in.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{now, some rent a cops have licenses to carry weapons, where others do not. which might you be? you wouldn't happen to have those permits handy, would you?}
<A>__{from the looks on the hobby cops' faces, julie can see that they don't.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{guess we know the answer to that one.}
