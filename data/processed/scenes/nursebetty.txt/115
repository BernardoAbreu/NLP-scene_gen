<A>__{the lincoln town car rumbles into the dusty parking lot and parks.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{this doesn't look like the kind of place betty would go to.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{maybe she had to use the bathroom. she pees, doesn't she?!...}
<A>__{wesley tears the photo of betty from the glove box.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{be careful with that!}
<A>__{charlie takes it back and gingerly secures the tape.}
<L>__{interior canyon ranch bar night}
<A>__{merle is at the bar, drunk, the only customer on a slow night. ellen drops two coasters in front of charlie and wesley as they sit down.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{what can i get you?}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{we're federal marshals, ma'am.}
<A>__{ellen looks dubiously at their unshaven faces and rumpled clothes.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we're looking for this young lady.}
<A>__{he slides the photo of betty across the bar. ellen's gaze drops to the picture for a second, and charlie sees what he was looking for a flicker of recognition. he allows himself a satisfied grin. wesley shows ellen his badge as merle checks out the photo.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{i haven't seen her.}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{sure you have! that's ...}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{shut up, merle.}
<A>__{charlie continues to grin at ellen ...}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{ma'am, if you've seen this woman }
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{betty! that's her name betty.}
<A>__{charlie takes the photo and puts it back in his pocket.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{i never saw that woman before, and neither has merle. he drinks too much. and don't try to tell me you're cops. i was married to a cop for nine years, and you're not cops. now get out of here.}
<A>__{wesley steps behind merle, takes a handful of his hair and slams his head into the popcorn machine on the bar. merle staggers away, stunned. wesley removes the tin popcorn scoop from a nearby hook. ellen reaches for something under the bar, but charlie's faster. he pins her arm with one hand.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you haven't been very forthcoming with us.}
<A>__{they watch wesley follow merle at a slow walk around the pool table, clobbering him over the head about every five steps with the popcorn scoop. merle wobbles with every shot, but won't go down. they begin a torturous second lap around the table, punctuated by the clang of the scoop against merle's head.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what's your name, dear?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{ellen.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that's a nice name.}
<A>__{after one more clanging shot merle staggers, then falls. wesley walks over to charlie and ellen, drawing his knife.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{that's a really nice name...}
