<L>__{interior cafeteria day}
<A>__{joey and his pals take turns drawing boobs onto a cafeteria tray with a magic marker. michael walks up and sits between them, casual as can be}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{are you lost?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{nope just came by to chat}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{we don't chat.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{well, actually, i thought i'd run an idea by you. you know, just to see if you're interested.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{we're not.}
<A>__{he grabs michael by the side of the head, and proceeds to draw a penis on his cheek with the magic marker. michael suffers the indignity and speaks undaunted.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(grimacing)}
<D>__{hear me out. you want bianca don't you?}
<A>__{joey sits back and cackles at his drawing.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{but she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{does this conversation have a purpose?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{so what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her. someone who's up for the job.}
<A>__{michael points to patrick, who makes a disgusted face at his turkey pot pie before he rises and throws it at the garbage can, rather than in it.}
<C>__{joey}
<A>__{that guy? i heard he ate a live duck once. everything but the beak and the feet.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{exactly}
<A>__{joey turns to look at michael.}
<C>__{joey}
<A>__{what's in it for you?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{oh, hey, nothin' man purely good will on my part.}
<A>__{he rises to leave and turns to the others.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i have a dick on my face, don't i?}
