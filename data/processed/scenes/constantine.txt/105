<L>__{interior exterior john's apartment night}
<A>__{john sits in his opened window, simmering. he holds a lit cigarette but doesn't dare put it to his lips. outside the city goes about its unending churn. down on the street are several police vehicles. engines start and they drive away. swirl of blue and red lights flash across john's moist eyes.}
<C>__{angela }
<D>__{there were no trees in our back yard.}
<A>__{john finds angela across the room in his doorway.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{but you knew that already, didn't you?}
<A>__{john meets her eyes. sees the questions piling up.}
<C>__{angela}
<P>__{(walking towards him)}
<D>__{you see something in me... something isabel had.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{go home, angela.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{i need to understand }
<A>__{john just shakes his head.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{because you open up to that world, you're inviting whatever's out there back in. that's what happened to isabel.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{i'm not isabel.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no, she embraced her gift while you denied yours and that denial is exactly why you're still alive. stick with me, that'll change.}
<A>__{john gets off the window, starts walking away.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{and i don't need another ghost following me around.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{dammit, john they killed my sister!}
<A>__{that stops him cold.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{i can't let them get away with that. even if it means going down the same path she did. now if you won't help me get there, i will find my own way. but i won't run. never.}
<A>__{the two stand there locked in this moment.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{please...}
<A>__{john can't believe this day looks her dead in the eye.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you do this, there's no turning back. you see them they see you. understand?}
<A>__{angela never blinks as she nods in agreement.}
