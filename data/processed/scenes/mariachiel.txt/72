<L>__{interior amadeus day}
<A>__{mariachi staggers into amadeus and washes his face in a fountain by the door. he makes his way to the bar as a patron pays and leaves.}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{what happened to you, mariachi? too much refresco?}
<C>__{mariachi}
<D>__{i just killed four guys.}
<A>__{domino turns around and looks at mariachi, wondering hard is he's joking. he lifts up a bloody hand, grabs a napkin, and then seems to ask permission with his eyes before wiping his hands clean.}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{is it true?}
<A>__{mariachi nods an ashamed yes. domino reaches for her gun under the counter. the camera is on mariachi when she brings it out and points at him.}

<D>__{i'm new in town. i don't know everyone!!! i have no friends here... and no enemies.}
<C>__{domino}
<P>__{(lowering the gun a bit)}
<D>__{thieves?}
<C>__{mariachi}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{no way. they were well dressed men. i checked into the cheapest hotel in town, no money, nothing of value, except this guitar and maybe this coat, which they could have taken when i left my room, but they didn't. they were only interested in killing me.}
<C>__{domino}
<P>__{(lifting the gun back up)}
<D>__{so why do you come here? you want to get me killed?}
<C>__{mariachi}
<D>__{i need a place to stay until i figure this out. they've got me mixed up with someone else.}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{and you've never seen them before? not even in another town?}
<C>__{mariachi}
<P>__{(long pause)}
<D>__{are you saying they followed me, a mariachi, here? what for?}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{maybe they hate your music.}
<A>__{mariachi stares at her expressionless. she stares back at him.}
<C>__{domino }
<D>__{maybe you were singing in another town, they hated your voice, and now they're trying to kill you.}
<C>__{mariachi}
<D>__{are you serious?}
<C>__{domino}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{yes.}
