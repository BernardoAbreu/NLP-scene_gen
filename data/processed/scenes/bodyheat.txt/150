<A>__{the fedora hangs on the coatstand. racine works at his desk, reading over a long contract. the sun is cutting through the venetian blinds behind him in glaring strips and, as he leans back in his chair, he finds it impossible to read his document. he gets up, goes to the window and adjusts the blinds so that his desk goes dark in the shade. as it does, the phone rings. beverly answers out in the reception room, her conversation muffled through the slightly cracked door. she hits a hold button and yells, as is her informal custom.}
