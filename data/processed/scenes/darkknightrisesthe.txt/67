<L>__{interior museum continuous}
<A>__{a lavish ball the expressively attired dance under falling confetti... even bruce wayne is struck by the ostentation. he spots selina dancing with a deeply smitten rich twit. she wears a small, velvet pair of cat ears. and the pearls.}
<C>__{miranda }
<D>__{bruce wayne at a charity ball?}
<A>__{wayne turns to find miranda tate, amazed, a small mask her only concession to fancy dress.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{miss tate, isn't it?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{even before you became a recluse, you never came to these things...}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{true. proceeds go to the big fat spread, not the cause. it's not about charity, it's about feeding the ego of whichever society hag laid it on.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{actually, this is my party, mr. wayne.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{and the proceeds will go where they should, because i paid for the big fat spread myself.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{that's very generous of you.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{you have to invest to restore balance to the world. take our clean energy project...}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{sometimes the investment doesn't pay off. sorry.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{you have a practiced apathy, mr. wayne. but a man who doesn't care about the world doesn't spend half his fortune on a plan to save it...}
<P>__{(gentle.) and isn't so wounded when}
<D>__{it fails that he goes into hiding...}
<A>__{wayne looks at miranda. intrigued.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{have a good evening, mr. wayne.}
<A>__{wayne watches miranda glide away. then turns to selina.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{mind if i cut in?}
<A>__{rich twit turns, annoyed wayne hands him his cane. takes selina by the waist. she glares at him.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{you don't seem very happy to see me.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{you were supposed to be a shut in.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{felt like some fresh air.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{why didn't you call the police?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{i have a powerful friend who deals with this kind of thing. (admires her cat ears.) brazen costume for a cat burglar.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{yeah? who are you pretending to be?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{bruce wayne, eccentric billionaire. who's your date?}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{his wife's in ibiza. she left her diamonds behind, though. worried they'd get stolen.}
<C>__{wayne}
<A>__{it's pronounced 'ibeetha'. you wouldn't want these folks realizing you're a crook not a social climber.}
<C>__{selina}
<P>__{(flash of anger)}
<A>__{you think i care what anyone in this room thinks about me?}
<C>__{wayne}
<A>__{i doubt you care what anyone in this room thinks about you.}
<C>__{selina}
<A>__{don't condescend, mr. wayne. you don't know a thing about me.}
<C>__{wayne}
<A>__{well, selina kyle, i know you came here from your walk up in old town modest place for a master jewel thief. which means either you're saving for your retirement or you're in deep with the wrong people.}
<C>__{selina}
<A>__{you don't get to judge me because you were born in the master bedroom of wayne manor.}
<C>__{wayne}
<A>__{actually, i was born in the regency room.}
<C>__{selina}
<A>__{i started off doing what i had to. once you've done what you had to they'll never let you do what you want to.}
<C>__{wayne}
<A>__{start fresh.}
<C>__{selina}
<A>__{there's no fresh start in today's world. any twelve year old with a cell phone could find out what you did. everything we do is collated and quantified. everything sticks. we are the sum of our mistakes.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{or our achievements.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{the mistakes stick better. trust me.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{you think that justifies stealing?}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{i take what i need to from those who have more than enough. i don't stand on the shoulders of people with less.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{robin hood?}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{i'd do more to help someone than most of the people in this room. than you.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{maybe you're assuming too much.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{or maybe you're being unrealistic about what's really in your pants other than your wallet.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{ouch.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{you think all this can last?}
<A>__{wayne glances around at the sumptuous party.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{there's a storm coming, mr. wayne. you and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits you're all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little to the rest of us.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{sounds like you're looking forward to it.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{i'm adaptable.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{these pearls do look better on you then they did in my safe...}
<A>__{wayne rolls her into his shoulder reaches up to the back of her neck, unclasps the necklace.}
<D>__{but i still can't let you keep them.}
<A>__{the pearls slide off her neck into his other hand. selina looks at him. angry. then kisses him, hard, and disappears into the crowd. wayne's cane reappears.}
<C>__{rich twit}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{you scared her off.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{not likely.}
