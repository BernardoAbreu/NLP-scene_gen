<L>__{exterior roadside inn day}
<A>__{they stop at the inn.}
<C>__{roderick}
<P>__{(very gallantly)}
<D>__{as you have been robbed of your purse, may i have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?}
<C>__{mrs. o'reilly}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{that's very kind of you, mr. o'higgins.}
<A>__{he gives her two gold pieces.}
<L>__{interior inn day}
<A>__{roderick and mrs. o'reilly finishing their meal. we will hear dialogue underneath roderick's voice over.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{how different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at kilwangan assemblies. in every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality. to the lady's question about my birth and parentage, i replied that i was a young gentleman of large fortune, that i was going to dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.}
<C>__{mrs. o'reilly}
<D>__{you must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. i hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where captain o'reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.}
<A>__{paying the bill.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{perhaps had i been a little older in the world's experience, i should have begun to see that madame o'reilly was not the person of fashion she pretended to be; but, as it was, i took all her stories for truth, and, when the landlord brought the bill for dinner, paid it with the air of a lord. indeed, she made no motion to produce the two pieces i had lent her.}
