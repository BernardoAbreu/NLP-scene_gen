<L>__{exterior where the elk people used to live night}
<A>__{the land behind red deer table is badlands. badlands pierced by a few rutted old wagon roads. at a place between two grotesque buttes, crow horse stops, looking uneasy. he digs into his pocket, pulls out some loose tobacco and spills it on the ground. then he walks on. ray observes this, starting forward, then stopping long enough to fish a cigarette out from his pocket and drop it next to crow horse's offering.}
<B>__{through the badlands}
<A>__{ray and crow horse walk, carefully under a full moon, scanning the area. crow horse stops, checks out some tracks. ray walks on, looking up at the table. he shines his flashlight up and it illuminates a red ribbon, tied on stakes on a ridge. ten stakes. twenty stakes. ribbons blowing in the wind.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.}
<A>__{ray sweeps the light along, walking faster, and then something frightening occurs. something... some unseen thing snags him by the leg, sucking him into the earth with a horrible gushing}
<B>__{sound.}
<A>__{ray is drawn into a hole up to his hips, a bluish black slime, oozing out around him. crow horse grabs him, struggling to pull him up. he does, stumbling back and stepping into a hole himself. the two men are wheeling, throwing flashlight beams around, slapping through a wet jelly, and finally getting their bearings. ray touches the ground where a blue black chemical solution oozes out with water from the aquifer below. his flashlight scans twenty drilled holes in the earth. a uranium strip mining grid laid out in a 50 x 60 pattern. the far side is fenced by flagged stakes.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{jesus. oil?}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{uranium. test holes. somebody came in from the nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. they're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{1868...}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{that's what we're doing here. national interest. national security. only this time it's not gold. it's uranium.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{we're standin' on broken treaty ground, ray. this ain't supposed to be here. it'll poison the water.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{leo knew about it. tried to tell jimmy, get the warriors involved.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{so they took care of leo.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{listen to the water... the river keeps goin' down then rising again.}
<A>__{ray goes to another hole and sticks his arm in up to the elbow, sniffs the solution.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{they're drainin' our water table. that's our life, man...}
<A>__{ray is looking past crow horse at something strange in the moonlight. coyotes. some forty yards away, on a flat stretch of stoney ground. six coyotes, dancing in the shadows of rock formations. moving in on them as ray walks forward, they circle... scatter... run back... circle again. look straight at ray, eyes glowing. and run. reverse ray and crow horse walk toward them. to the place they just left. a place in the dirt, they were digging up. when they reach it, they stare down into the dirt.}
<B>__{a body}
<A>__{lies there, face down. denim jacket and a shock of black hair, thrown into tangles and dirt. it was buried. until the coyote caught wind. crow horse bends down, touches the jacket... turns the body over and almost vomits when he sees maggie eagle bear.}
<B>__{ray}
<A>__{looks down in disbelief.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{no. no...}
<A>__{ray steps back, his boots squishing in solution and sealant and soiled water. he covers his mouth, stopping himself from getting sick. and then he explodes, yelling. long shot red deer table in the moonlight. and ray's yelling echoing up out of the rocks}
