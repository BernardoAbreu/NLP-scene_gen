<A>__{coraline walks through the gates. the bright magic of the garden is darker now, with areas of black against areas of glowing flowers. she passes the pitcher plants, and the one with the frog suddenly swallows the animal. she goes up the steps past the bleeding hearts, which now leak sticky red juice that runs down the wall. at the top, a few snapdragons, feeble now, snap at her. she kicks them down. behind her, a brick tree ring opens like a monster's mouth and five huge, pale snapdragons sneak towards her. they attack, knock her to the ground, spilling her bag.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{no!!}
<A>__{they grab coraline at her ankles, knees, hips, waist, and shoulder, and start to roll her up towards the stone}
<B>__{mouth.}
<A>__{coraline is just able to grab her garden shears. she cuts off one mutant snapdragon's head, then another, until she is free. the headless stems retreat into the rock mouth. coraline, winded, goes to gather her spilled things when a trio of hummingbirds wasp hybrids swoop in. they don't attack her; instead they poke their long beaks into the triangle candy with the hole and lift off.}
<C>__{coraline }
<D>__{stop!!}
<A>__{coraline chases them, but they're getting away. as she crosses the little bridge, she takes off her cap and flings it like a frisbee at them. score! they fall to the ground, near the eyebrow shrubs, sawdust spilling out. she picks up the triangle candy.}
<C>__{coraline }
<D>__{why steal this?}
<A>__{with a look of what does she have to lose, she holds it up to her eye and gasps.}
<C>__{coraline }
<D>__{wow...}
<A>__{everything is blurry grey like a pencil drawing, all color gone. she scans the garden, turning slowly. as she turns back to where she started, she sees something, right in front of her: a burning red ember a ghost's eye!}
<C>__{coraline }
<D>__{that must be it.}
<A>__{she lowers the stone from her eye, to see that the ghost's eye is the faded stick shift knob from the preying mantis tractor, which stands right in front of her with the other father, a squat pumpkin man, at its controls, his own hands imprisoned in the mechanical}
<B>__{piano hands.}
<A>__{headlights glare and the tractor roars to life. the mechanical hands force other father to shift gears, and the tractor lurches at coraline, its arms slashing. she yells, backs away. other father calls in a garbled voice:}
<C>__{other father}
<D>__{sorrry, so sorrry, motherrr making meeee.}
<A>__{coraline backs onto the little bridge that spans the fountains as the tractor moves in.}
<C>__{other father }
<D>__{don't waaaanno hurrrrrt you.}
<A>__{the other father tries to steer the tractor away, but the mechanical hands are stronger. it moves onto the bridge stupidly smashing through the planks in front of it. halfway over, it lurches, then starts to fall through the hole it has created. the tractor hangs precariously for a moment. other father kicks away one mechanical hand, and with one hand free, manages to pull off the shift knob.}
<C>__{other father }
<D>__{taaaake it!!!!!}
<A>__{coraline dives forward and just gets the knob before the tractor and other father fall away and sink under the}
<B>__{water.}
<A>__{rippling out from coraline like a gray wave, the entire}
<B>__{garden becomes ashen and dead.}
<A>__{coraline catches her breath, shaken. the ghost eye gear knob glows red, no magic candy necessary.}
<C>__{boy ghost}
<D>__{bless you, miss, you found me! but there's two eyes still lost.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{don't worry, i'm getting the hang of it!}
<A>__{coraline looks past the greyed garden towards the other house. a lunar eclipse has begun, the full moon a pale acid green. coraline looks concerned, then resolved, and then she heads towards the house. a haunting version of spink and forcible's show song starts to play...}
