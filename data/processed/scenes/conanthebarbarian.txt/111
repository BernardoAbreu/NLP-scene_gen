<L>__{interior acheron cave night}
<A>__{khalar singh chants in acheronian. ancient, harsh words, as he lifts the two crowns overhead, offering them to the statues of dark gods all around.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{stop. you don't know what you are about to do.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{but i do. for thirty years i have dreamed of this day. the day our people rise from the ashes.}
<A>__{khalar singh continues his chant and places the gold crown upon his head. as he does so, the light from the moon reflects off the crown, bathing the sacrificial pool in an unnatural glow. thump thump. a deep and foreboding sound echoes throughout the cave, shaking everything like an earthquake. it sounds like the heartbeat of a giant. khalar next places the iron crown around tamara's head. she thrashes and struggles but to no avail. once the crown is around her head thump thump! the spikes around the iron crown grow shorter as the spikes drive themselves into her head. she screams in agony. blood drips from beneath the crown, flowing into channels around the edges of the altar.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{it begins. you give birth to an empire.}
