<L>__{interior will's room later}
<A>__{will and rachel in bed. spooning. rachel behind will, her finger tracing his scar. rain drums against the window. will. watching the raindrops streaming down the glass. casting strange shadows against the wall.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{there was this guy named weston dobbs. twenty four. worked as a part time stock boy in a copy store. every morning he'd sit at the only window in his apartment and watch an eight year old boy get picked up by his carpool across the street. and every afternoon he'd watch the boy get dropped off again. he did this for about six months. until one day he got up the nerve to cross the street and grab the boy before his carpool came. kept him in his apartment for three days. tortured him. raped him. made him do things...}
<A>__{will tenses his jaw. rachel, listens in horror.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{when he was done, he got a rope and a kitchen stool and hanged the boy in the basement of the apartment building. but he didn't do a good enough job. the little boy's neck didn't break and he died from shock. the landlord found him five days later.}
<A>__{rachel reaches for will's hand. squeezes it.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{one of your cases?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{me and hap. a year and a half ago. i knew the second i met dobbs that he was guilty. smug, cold. dead eyes. we had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it. nothing concrete. went over every inch of that apartment.}
<A>__{he pauses.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what happened?}
<A>__{will turns slowly over to face her. her hair, splayed out on the pillow. her cheeks, flushed. her eyes, listening.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{we took some blood samples from the boy's body and planted them in his apartment.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{arrested him the next day.}
<A>__{rachel looks at him. goose pimples on her arms. realising the weight of the confession.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{will.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{there've been other cases. where we've changed results. pushed witnesses. manipulated evidence.}
<P>__{(rubs his face)}
<D>__{but dobbs. i wanted dobbs more than anything.}
<A>__{he sits up. abrupt. wincing from the pain in his ribs. rests his arms on his knees.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what if someone finds out?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{we're under investigation now. back in seattle.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{hap wanted to talk. as soon as we got back. thought he could work out some kind of deal.}
<A>__{rachel rubs his shoulder.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{well, that's not going to happen now.}
<A>__{will closes his eyes. the rain, pattering. rhythmic.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{do you think it was wrong? what we did?}
<A>__{there's a pause. rachel, studying will's back. the cuts. the bruises. not sure how to answer.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{there are two kinds of people in alaska. those who were born here and those who've come here to escape something in their lives.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i wasn't born here, will. i'm in no position to judge anyone. i'm not about that any more.}
<A>__{looks out the window.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{it's all about what you're willing to live with.}
