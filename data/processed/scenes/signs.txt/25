<A>__{officer paski's knee touches the ground. he points to a single stalk of corn laying flat on it's side.}
<C>__{officer paski}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{look at where it's bent over.}
<A>__{graham stands next to him and leans in. the joint where the stalk bends from the ground is a perfect "l".}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{it's not broken.}
<C>__{officer paski}
<D>__{what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?}

<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(preoccupied)}
