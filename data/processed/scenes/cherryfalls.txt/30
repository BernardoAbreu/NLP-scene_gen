<A>__{the boy pulls his hand from under the girl's shirt and unsnaps her jeans. she pushes his hand away but he puts it right back, wriggling a finger down into her pants. jody marken, a pretty all american sixteen year old girl, strong willed but still innocent, stops kissing her boyfriend kenny, trying to hold him off. kenny is also sixteen. he's thin and a bit shaggy, but very cute nonetheless. his hair is shoulder length, his stare intense. he takes himself seriously, all rebel.}
