<A>__{angle on white from outside the window, through blurry glass. a rapid flying p.o.v. pulls back in silence. the window is a speck on the side of a vast grey tower.}
<B>__{back in the bathroom}
<A>__{white shivers, cold. he stares down at the puddle he drips on the floor. he looks at his feet and legs, covered with numerous small bites. he dries the bloody wounds with a towel. he picks up the clothes lying on the chair, puts them on. loose trousers with braces, a plain shirt, leathers shoes with holes in both soles. in his trouser pocket he finds a key a room number on a plastic tag. he hears splashing in the bath tub. he steps over, looks into the murky water. suddenly a small silver fish leaps from the water, lands at his feet, panting heavily and flapping about. he leans down, picks the fish up, throws it back into the water. like a blind man, he feels the walls, comes to a door in the shadows. he hears something on the other side, hesitates, hand inches from the doorknob. he leans down.}
<B>__{tight on his eye}
<A>__{blinking through the key hole. p.o.v. of an empty room a glimpse of motion the door across the room (leading to a corridor?) is shutting.}
