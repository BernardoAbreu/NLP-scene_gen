<L>__{interior winter's room day}
<A>__{amy's eyes snap open as we quickly boom up to find her lying on a mattress in the middle of the floor surrounded by the deaders. she's in the middle of the ritual. the deaders are all chanting. marla and joey are there.}
<C>__{deaders }
<D>__{my skin isn't real. my eyes aren't real. my muscles aren't real.}
<C>__{deaders}
<D>__{my bones, my heart, my veins and nerves, and flesh and meat... aren't real. what i see, what i hear, what i taste, what i touch, what i remember, what i think, what i feel, aren't real.}
<A>__{with a glance she can see that the puzzle box, in its solved configuration, sits on a make shift altar at the head of the mattress. winter is towering over her at her feet. he holds out a knife the familiar stiletto for her to take.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{you've gone through this before amy. go through it again with me.}
<A>__{amy has a sudden look of resignation, mixed with a little relief. she reaches out and slowly takes the knife from winter.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{that's it. i knew you were the one. the second i saw you, i knew you were the one.}
<A>__{the chanting continues.}
<C>__{deaders}
<D>__{my skin isn't real. my eyes aren't real. my muscles aren't real. my bones, my heart, my veins and nerves, and flesh and meat... aren't real. what i see, what i hear, what i taste, what i touch, what i remember, what i think, what i feel, isn't real.}
<A>__{amy looks at marla. she looks deader then ever. she chants with the others. winter holds the knife closer for amy. amy looks at the puzzle box. rays of light start to stretch out like hands and swirl from the puzzle box.}
<B>__{the room starts to rumble.}
<A>__{a black void starts to take shape and swirl behind them. winter is pleased.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{it's working. i knew it.}
<A>__{he kneels down next to amy.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{say it with us amy. you have to say it with us.}
<A>__{amy's hands start to tremble.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{yes you can amy. you're one of us now, all you have to do is take this final step and let the pain go. and welcome a world of ultimate pleasures. an arm, bluish white, stretches out from the void trying to grab joey who ducks it's grasp.}
<A>__{the deaders break the circle around amy as more arms reach out from the void. the voices of tortured souls, twisted and warped, scream out for help in the wind that bursts out of the void. hooks and chains reach out and grab the outstretched arms, dragging them back into the void. back into hell. the deaders turn to winter they're all a little freaked out. from the look on their faces it's clear that this isn't at all what they expected.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{where are the naked chicks? the oil? the orgies?}
<A>__{it's not what winter expected either.}
<C>__{winter}
<P>__{(calm)}
<D>__{finish it amy.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{winter}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{finish it!}
<A>__{amy steels herself with sudden resolve.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{and with that amy slams the knife into the makeshift alter next to her. and that's when pinhead steps through the void and into this world. a few cenobites follow. all the deaders step back this is weird... even for them. amy leaps up and stumbles back as pinhead slowly approaches winter, carefully studying him as he does, until he's right in winter's face.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{i see that evil does run in the family.}
<A>__{inter is plays it tough. but it's all an act.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{your lineage is of a craftsman. you should have stayed in the family business. i sacrificed my mortal self for that box.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{it's mine now. it belongs to me.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{that's where you're painfully wrong. we belong to it.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{it created you, and it can destroy you.}
<P>__{(to amy)}
<D>__{amy, finish it!}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{when it is done with me perhaps but i'm afraid one's own personal hell is eternal, as you will soon see.}
<A>__{pinhead takes in the puzzle box on the makeshift altar, the deaders, amy.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{the box is not just the map of the road it is the road itself.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{the ultimate experience.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{experience is a funny thing boy, it likes to test us first and teach us later. are you sure you can pass the test? are you sure you want to?}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{you can't hurt me.}
<A>__{pinhead smiles.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{it's not the first time i've heard that.}
<A>__{and then it's hooks and chains time. they reach out from the void all around winter and stab into him. he screams out in complete agony as they tear at him and stretch his limbs to the point of ripping them off.}
<B>__{and then they stop.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{and it won't be the last.}
<A>__{winter's screams subside as a rush of pain surges through him, numbing him. he's just able to turn his head to pinhead and crack the slightest "fuck you" smile. winter tries to talk, but the skin around his mouth is stretched too tight.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{when you attempted to challenge evil you entered into my domain. there is no way in but through me.}
<A>__{pinhead gets in close to winter's face.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{careful what you wish for.}
<A>__{now we can see the terror in winter's eyes.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{it just might come true.}
<A>__{winter screams as he is finally torn apart by the chains. pinhead turns his attention to the deaders.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{this world, it obviously disappoints you all. perhaps that's why you choose to begin this journey. and as long as you so willingly accepted, allow me to finish off what he started.}
<A>__{and out of the darkness an oversized menacing chain comes flying out, harpooning straight through the midsections of all the deaders lined on the right side of amy. piercing them at all different levels. then another chain harpoons the deaders on the left side. the deaders look like fish on a stringer. they dangle there, suspended by the chains.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<P>__{(to amy)}
<D>__{and as for you. you opened the box, you brought us all together. you chose wisely. i'm pleased.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i didn't want any of this. they used me to open the box. i didn't choose to do anything.}
<A>__{amy looks to marla, she's got the fear of god in her. pinhead sees amy looking for help.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{she's one of us now amy. now a guide to the far reaches of pleasure. to a world where suffering is taken to higher level.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{please.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{you opened the box.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i didn't mean to. i only wanted the truth.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{and now you have it. but knowledge comes with a price and it's time to pay.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what about them?}
<A>__{we see the cenobites now with snake like tongues working their way up the line of deaders towards amy. they're preparing each one as they pass. poking them with large pins, piercing them, stitching them, filleting them, etc...}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{they belong to me now. they offered themselves willingly through him to me and now it's time for you to do the same.}
<A>__{amy grabs the knife from the floor and points it at pinhead.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{it won't be that easy this time. but yes, your father is with us too. and he's waiting for you.}
<A>__{these words pierce through amy. she looks at marla, now barely hanging on to any signs of liveliness. her head lifts up to amy.}
<C>__{arla}
<D>__{you're here to stop this amy. he needs your soul willingly. don't let him take you. don't go willingly.}
<A>__{marla looks at the knife. amy gets it, she only has one way out. marla can see the uncertainty in her eyes.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{its over. winter is gone. you can't come back. you won't become a deader...or one of them.}
<A>__{marla looks to pinhead, then back to amy. they both know what she has to do.}
<C>__{marla}
<P>__{(her final words)}
<D>__{only he can bring you back.}
<A>__{amy sees the meat hanging off the chains. it used to be winter. she glares at pinhead with a sudden look of confidence, like a light bulb has gone off and she can finally see her way out. she raises the knife high in front of her. the two snake tongued cenobites move in closer to amy. they can't wait to have a little taste. for a moment, pinhead is pleased, then amy begins the deader chant, but reverses its meaning.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{my skin is real. my eyes are real. my muscles are real. my bones, my heart, my veins and nerves, and flesh and meat... are real. what i see, what i hear, what i taste, what i touch, what i remember, what i think, what i feel, is real.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{it's too late to save yourself. your soul is mine and mine alone. your father is waiting for you. he misses you so much.}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{the only way out amy klein is through me.}
<A>__{the cenobites freeze for a beat and turn to pinhead. they haven't seen that before. she stares pinhead right in the eyes.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i didn't give my soul to him...}
<A>__{amy points the knife at what's left of winter.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{...and i'm not giving it to you.}
<A>__{and with that amy thrusts the knife into her chest. pinhead screams out.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{the room starts to fill with a bright light. the puzzle box starts to close as pinhead and the boys are sucked back into the void, which closes behind them. amy looks up from the knife planted deep in her gut and smiles. she tips out of frame as the screen bleaches white and we }
