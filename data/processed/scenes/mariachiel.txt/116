<D>__{the musician your men confused with azul.}
<C>__{moco}
<P>__{(staring at her)}
<D>__{so that's why you were busy that night...}

<C>__{moco }
<D>__{... you had that little monkey climbing all over you.}
<C>__{azul}
<D>__{give me my money or i kill her now!!!}
<C>__{moco}

<A>__{azul is anxious now.}
<C>__{azul}
<D>__{i swear i will kill her!}
<C>__{moco}
<D>__{no you won't. i will.}
<A>__{moco pulls out his gun and shoots her in the heart. she falls limp in azul's arms. azul tries hold her up, but she's dead. azul rests her on the ground, looking down at her, wondering why it's all come to this.}
<C>__{azul}
<D>__{all i wanted was my rightful share. but you've got to kill everybody.}
<C>__{moco}
<D>__{you feel sorry for her, don't you? see, that's why you can't ever be as big as me.}
<A>__{azul slowly looks at moco.}
<C>__{moco }
<P>__{(aiming gun)}
<D>__{because you have too much heart.}
<A>__{moco shoots azul in the heart. azul had his hands to his side, and now he falls to his knees. moco shoots him again, and azul dies next to domino. mean dude #5 is exchanging glances with the others. no one seems to be on moco's side.}
