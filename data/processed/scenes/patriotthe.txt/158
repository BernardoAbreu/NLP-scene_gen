<A>__{the american forces are on the move, all heading in the same direction. continentals and militiamen fill the road. some on horseback, others in wagons, most on foot. among them, a mixed unit of continentals and marion's brigade, at the head of which ride lee, dalton, abner and rev. oliver. behind them, a single horseman rides up. it's marion. without speaking, marion rides up alongside lee. they exchange nods. marion rides between dalton on one side and rev. oliver on the other. they pass a sign that reads, "yorktown. miles."}
