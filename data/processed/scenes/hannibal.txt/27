<C>__{barney}
<D>__{you almost took down evelda drumgo.}
<C>__{starling}

<C>__{barney}
<D>__{...what hindered you...?}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{it wasn't my day.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{perhaps you did not have the support you required.}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{it's a poor workman who blames his tools.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{or, perhaps...}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{...how are things at the hospital?}

<C>__{starling}
<D>__{...you...}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{i'm struck by your phraseology. i did not last with him. i was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.}
<C>__{starling}
<P>__{(getting down to business, as she takes out a pencil.)}
<D>__{i'm looking for...}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{he said, and these were his words, he valued our time together, because i was civil.}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{he told me, he preferred to eat the rude. or: "natural composting." do you think he'd come after you ...?}
<B>__{starling looks out the window. angle her pov}
<A>__{out the window, se see the dove circling the dead dove on the}
<B>__{ratty piece of grass.}
<C>__{starling}
<P>__{(turning back)}
<D>__{what...?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{i asked you how you like your coffee...? we have black and bitter. as the soul of man. or light and sweet, as the world view of the self delusive.}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{we got a bunch of materials , coming up at auction. materials which disappeared from dr. lechter's cell, drawings he made, his books .}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{yes?}

<C>__{barney}
<D>__{...very good.}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{here's what they want you to do: we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{...why?}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{you said "here's what they want you to do..." why?}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{now, whyn't you help us?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{that would adversely impact my income.}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{not as much as being jailed for theft of government property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{we could skip the gavotte.}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{say it in english.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{lechter's not buying up his memorabilia. he keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{then who's buying it?}
<C>__{barney}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{there's one or two freaks, and, for a " pass ," i will rat them out to you...}
<P>__{(he takes a pencil, and puts a couple of names in her book, leaning over her)}
<D>__{starling that's the spirit...}
<A>__{angle, barney as he leans over, looming over starling.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{...aren't you afraid of me...?}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{you want me to be?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{i'd prefer it...}
<P>__{(he finishes writing)}

<B>__{he and starling finish their coffee. he begins to walk her out.}
<A>__{angleexteriorbarney's apartment, as they exit.}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{a vacant exercise, why ...?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{you said "here's what they want you to do." aren't you part of them anymore...? aren't you part of the fbi? 'no girl's allowed,' or what ? have you transgressed...?}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{let's keep it to business, shall we?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{...they did it for a lark.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{oh, good. the ornithological leitmotif...}
<B>__{he takes her over to the dead bird. he picks up the dead}
<A>__{bird, and smooths its feathers. he addresses the circling}
<B>__{dove.}
<C>__{barney }
<D>__{off you go. you've grieved enough. anything more would be self indulgence.}
<C>__{starling}
<P>__{(as she looks at her book of names) who are these guys...?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{rich, comic book freaks.}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{and why is it a vacant exercise?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{because we both know who's buying the lechteriana.}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{who would that be.}
<C>__{barney}
<P>__{(as if stating the most obvious fact.)}
<D>__{mason verger. for he cannot be free. dr. lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice. can you be free....?}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{no, you're wrong about verger.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{oh, yes. he's found peace.}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{well, if he hasn't, i'm vastly mistaken.}
<C>__{barney}
<P>__{(pauses, and looks at her intently)}
<D>__{and have you found peace..?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<A>__{angle, on barney, as he starts putting the dead bird in}
<B>__{his pocket.}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{what'll you do with the bird...?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{pluck it, and eat it. it was so good to see you..}
