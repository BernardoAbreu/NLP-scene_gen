<D>__{i couldn't move. alls i could see was the loft above their heads.}
<T>__{jump cut to:}
<A>__{her mouth covered, her head immobile she stares up at the loft.}
<B>__{end of memory images.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the loft?}
<L>__{interior kitchen present day.}
<A>__{sethe squeezes her eyes to erase the image and works harder on the biscuit dough...the flashes of images stop...}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{i told mrs. garner on them. she had that lump on her neck and couldn't speak but her eyes rolled out tears, i remember. them boys found out i told on 'em and schoolteacher made one open up my back, and when it closed it made a tree.}

<D>__{they used cowhide on you?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{and they took my milk.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{they beat you and you was pregnant?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{and they took my milk!}
<A>__{sethe has separated the dough into biscuits which she slips into the stove. as she rises, paul steps gently behind her. he slowly caresses her breasts from behind, pressing his cheek against her back.. he rubs his cheek against it, feeling the scars beneath the dress. raising his fingers to the hooks, as sethe cries silently, he undoes her dress which slips down to her hips, exposing the sculpture her back has become.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{aw lord, girl.}
<A>__{grateful to have her body be someone else's responsibility for the moment, sethe closes her eyes as paul touches every ridge and leaf of her tree with his mouth. the tenderness is almost unbearable. suddenly, paul's legs begin trembling. he pauses and looks down...he realizes it is not his legs that tremble, but rather; the floorboards themselves are pitching, grinding, shoving the house from side to side. sethe slides to the floor, struggling with her dress. on all fours, denver crawls in from the keeping room as if trying to keep the house together. paul, falling, reaching for an anchor, begins to shout;}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{god damn it! hush up! leave this place alone! get the hell outta here!}
<A>__{a table rushes at him but paul grabs it's leg. managing to stand at an angle as the house continues to pitch, he holds the table by two legs and bashes it about, wrecking everything, screaming at the house;}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you want to fight, come on! god damn it! she got enough without you! she got enough!}
<A>__{the quaking slows to an occasional lurch but paul does not stop whipping the table around until everything it is absolutely still. he leans against the wall, panting. sethe is crouched by the stove. a mixed expression of relief and guilt the expression of a mother whose disobedient child has been sent away. but a child she loves nonetheless. denver looks frightened. more alone than ever, now that her one companion is gone. all three are breathing together as if to the same beat, like one tired person.}
