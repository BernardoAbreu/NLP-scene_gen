<L>__{ext wagon magic hour}
<A>__{a large woman, wyatt's black horses tied to the rear, crosses the majestic, forbidding arizona desert with its red volcanic rocks and the giant saguaro cactus dotting the landscape so mysteriously, like huge, spiny hieroglyphics....}
<L>__{ext camp by river night}
<A>__{a camp by the river under a clear night sky dripping with stars. after dinner. the women, virgil, and morgan sit by the fire. morgan petting his dog, a sweet little foxhound. louisa sits behind him, twirling his silky blonde hair, turning to mattie:}
<C>__{louisa}
<D>__{don't you love their hair? they all have the same hair.}
<A>__{just then wyatt appears on his stallion, galloping across the moonlit plain toward them, sitting his horse like a centaur. it's clear he's a magnificent horseman. virgil smiles:}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{look at him go, will ya? i tell you, that's the real wyatt, born in the saddle.}
<C>__{mattie}
<D>__{oh, he can go all right.}
<C>__{allie}
<D>__{can he then?}
<C>__{mattie}
<D>__{rather ride than eat.}
<A>__{the women cackle lasciviously. virgil groans at allie:}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{try to be a lady, will you?}
<A>__{wyatt rides up and dismounts, unsaddling the horse.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{give him some good exercise? sure some stud. some string in fact. what're you gonna do, race 'em?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{hope so. clean up with this boy.}
<A>__{louisa turns to mattie, fishing in her bag:}
<C>__{louisa}
<D>__{mattie hon', did you say you needed some laudanum? i have a bottle right here. just be careful. it's full of hop.}
<C>__{mattie}
<D>__{you're a lifesaver! don't worry, i just get headaches sometimes.}
<A>__{as wyatt leads the horse away the women get up, allie and louisa going to the river with dishes, mattie crossing to the wagon. virgil and morgan watch her appreciatively:}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{mighty fine. wonder where he found her. same place we found ours probably}
<A>__{at the other end of camp mattie climbs into the wagon and lies down. wyatt appears and starts to stroke her head.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{come up to the fire, honey.}
<C>__{mattie}
<D>__{i think i will just lie down awhile}
<A>__{a coyote starts howling from the far darkness. mattie shudders:}
<C>__{mattie}
<D>__{long as i live i will never get used to that sound.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{they're just lonely is all. hell, i howl myself sometimes.}
<C>__{mattie}
<D>__{you get lonely?}
<A>__{she seems genuinely surprised. wyatt looks genuinely confused. over at the fire, morgan hugs and mashes louisa playfully.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{come up, lou. come up here, girl.}
<C>__{louisa}
<D>__{stop...}
<A>__{she fights loose. wyatt walks up, sits, shaking his gold watch.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{look at that. busted. brand new money ward, too. 33 years old and i don't even have a decent watch. 'bout time i started lookin' out for myself.}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{well here we are a family again. been so long plain forgot how good it feels. want to thank you for that, wyatt. all your doin'.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{we're gonna do it, boys. gonna get ours. feel it in my bones. all we have to do is keep our eyes on that brass ring.}
<C>__{morgan}
<P>__{(lies back)}
<D>__{boy, look at all those stars. bet you can see every star there is. practical touch 'em. kinda makes you think, you know? i mean you look up and you think god made all that but he still remembered to make a little speck like me. kinda flattering really. hey, wyatt, you believe in god? no, come on, really, do you?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{maybe, yeah. hell, i don't know.}
<C>__{morgan}

<C>__{wyatt}

<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{i read this book, book on spiritualism...}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{oh, god, here he goes...}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{...said a lot of people, when they're dyin', they see this light, like in a tunnel. they say it's the light leading you to heaven.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{really? what about hell? they got a sign or what?}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{hey, wyatt, god damn it, i'm serious!}
<C>__{wyatt}
