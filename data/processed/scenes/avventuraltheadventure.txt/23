<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{a crowd of people that keeps growing and growing from one moment to the next, is gathered in one of the main streets of messina, in front of a men's store with its shutters half shut. the local police are unable to control the flow of traffic, which has been blocked as a result of the crowd. the cars are packed close to one another, raising a great din with their horns. the throng is composed chiefly of young men pushing and climbing over each other to get near the shop to see inside. sandro tries to make his way through the crowd in an attempt to get up close himself, but the confusion is so great that he finds the going very difficult. remarks and comments are heard above the noise.}
<C>__{first young man}
<D>__{who is it, sophia loren?}
<C>__{second young man}
<D>__{oh, no! it's some model from turin with a low cut dress.}
<C>__{other voices}
<D>__{it's queen saroya... i saw her... so, who could it be?}
<C>__{third young man}
<D>__{they've torn her dress... she's almost nude... she ran into the shop to hide herself...}
<A>__{a police siren is heard from afar, then before long it fills the air and dominates every other sound. an alfa romeo pulls up, followed by a police wagon full of policemen. both vehicles maneuver their way through the crowd like snakes through a jungle, and stop right in front of the shop. sandro takes advantage of the opening created by the two cars and thus finds himself a few steps away from the door. bending over in order to see through the small space left open by the half drawn shutters, he notices several newspapermen and photographers.}
<C>__{sandro}
<P>__{(to one of the newspapermen)}
<D>__{which one of you is zuria?}
<C>__{newspaperman}
<D>__{he's inside.}
<A>__{meanwhile, the policemen have come out of the wagon and arrive at the door of the shop, with the chief of police leading the way. one of them raises the shutter, and the crowd, which has backed away slightly at the insistence of the police, begins pressing forward threateningly. soon pandemonium breaks loose. in the confusion, sandro manages to get inside the store along with the policemen and two photographers. the shutter is again lowered, just a few inches behind him. standing in the middle of the shop is a most charming and provocative young brunette with tight fitting pants and a blouse that is open almost from the neck to the waist. she is wearing nothing under her blouse, so that with every movement of her body, one cannot help catching a glimpse of her naked breasts. as the policemen come forward, she receives them with a smile. sandro asks one of the journalists standing nearby if he can tell him which one of them is zuria. the journalist points to a man who is only a few steps away a man not very old but who has a ravaged face, and whose hair is almost completely white.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{zuria?}
<C>__{zuria}
<D>__{yes. until proven otherwise.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{i would like to ask you something.}
<C>__{zuria}
<D>__{wait a moment. can't you see i'm busy?}
<A>__{everybody is gathered around the chief of police and the girl. the store clerks are looking at her admiringly. the manager, most upset, is explaining the situation to the chief of police.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{i phoned you, chief, because, in view of the situation... i thought it best...}
<A>__{the girl interrupts him. she has a very self satisfied look on her face.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i came down here to buy a foulard... suddenly i realized that little by little, directly behind me, i was being followed by so many men, and more and more of them kept coming.}
<C>__{chief of police}
<D>__{well, i should think so... dressed like that.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{but i have always gone around like this, everywhere in the world. nothing like this has ever happened to me before.}
<A>__{zuria turns to sandro and clears his throat. outside, the crowd becomes very noisy.}
<C>__{zuria}
<P>__{(to the girl)}
<D>__{how old are you?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{nineteen. my name is gloria perkins. i'm married and a writer by profession. i write in a trance, almost always in contact with people who are dead. tolstoi, for example, or shakespeare. but the movies also interest me.}
<A>__{zuria nods to sandro as if to say: now watch this.}
<C>__{zuria}
<D>__{how do you find the men of messina? are you shocked by their warm display of friendliness?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{no, why should i be shocked? we're in italy, not finland.}
<C>__{zuria}
<D>__{and how were you received in palermo?}
<A>__{the girl turns around and looks down at zuria with contempt, but she manages to remain calm.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{in palermo i was with my husband. now i'm going to capri to write an article for the tourist office.}
<A>__{zuria clears his throat again and whispers to sandro.}
<C>__{zuria}
<D>__{she did exactly the same thing in palermo.}
<C>__{chief of police}
<P>__{(to the girl)}
<D>__{if you want to go back to your hotel... we're ready to escort you.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{oh, yes, thank you...}
<A>__{photographer snaps a flash photo. the girl immediately strikes a pose. other flashes follow. the clerks ask for her autograph. one of the policemen raises the shutter; the girl comes forward smiling, and is greeted with a certain kind of roar from the crowd. the group leaves the shop. sandro and zuria also come out. the girl, ushered out by the policemen, climbs into the alfa romeo. the guard holds the crowd back. there are more camera flashes. more smiles from the pretty stranger. finally the car pulls out, followed by the police wagon. sandro and zuria watch the car disappear through the crowd, which starts to disperse. the din, however, is still enormous, due to the unsnarling of the traffic jam.}
<C>__{zuria}
<D>__{do you like her?}
<A>__{sandro shrugs his shoulders, somewhat surprised by the journalist's question.}
<C>__{zuria}
<D>__{she costs a hundred thousand lire.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{you're kidding!}
<C>__{zuria}
<D>__{no, i'm not. why do you think she does all this? it's one of the many ways she can put herself on display. when you bait the trap, the mouse will snap. to tell you the truth, if it wasn't for the fact that one hundred thousand lire represents my whole month's salary, well... but you had something you wanted to ask me?}
<A>__{sandro is still looking at the journalist with a sense of incredulity, almost as if he felt zuria's conversation was something out of this world. but he is brought back to reality by zuria's last remark, which is made as the journalist starts walking at a very hurried pace.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{i read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. i'm that girl's fianc.}
<C>__{zuria}
<D>__{oh... i'm sorry i have to rush but i've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... tell me exactly how it all turned out.}
<C>__{sandro}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{now listen, if i had any information, i wouldn't have come here to ask you. but i see that you, too, lack any information ...}
<A>__{the journalist casts a sidewards glance at sandro. he is a bitter and sarcastic man, one who is completely absorbed with his own little problems and his own daily routine. but for this very reason he is quite capable of taking any kind of insult, either big or small.}
<C>__{zuria}
<D>__{as a matter of fact, i've already had several phone calls on that article. one said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in rome. another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... could be she secretly left the island by boat...}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{is that possible?}
<C>__{zuria}
<D>__{who knows?... another one has it that she entered a store in troina. this information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought i don't know what in his store... at troina.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{is that far from here?}
<C>__{zuria}
<D>__{about fifty miles or so. if you want, i will give you the name of the storekeeper.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{yes... of course... but you should also print that in your paper... but right away, tomorrow morning... it's the local palermo paper, isn't it?... i mean, it's widely read...}
<C>__{zuria}
<D>__{yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? even if i sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{you really must do me this one favor.}
<C>__{zuria}
<D>__{pardon me, but why must i do you a favor?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{then let's call it a business proposition. something to round out your salary.}
<A>__{the journalist clears his throat without answering. then he grabs sandro by the arm and takes him back to the other side of the street where a few people, left over from the crowd, are still discussing the incident that just took place as they gradually drift away from the scene. the traffic is now back to normal.}
