<T>__{cut:}
<A>__{kafka's street night he stands at a corner, looking at his own house, scared even to go home. but everything seems normal. he starts walking there. but when he reaches his front door:}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{did you think you'd be safe back in your little burrow?}
<A>__{kafka turns. one of the assistants stands next to him.}
<C>__{other voice}
<D>__{no matter how deep a hole you dig for yourself, the beast will always find you.}
<A>__{kafka turns the other way. the other assistant is on his other side. kafka looks between the two of them.}
<C>__{oskar}
<D>__{we're to take you to the castle.}
<A>__{kafka might have expected this.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{so. you're the guides up there. and we thought it was burgel.}
<A>__{one of the assistants draws a revolver. the other chuckles.}
<C>__{ludwig}
<D>__{they wouldn't let burgel into the castle. you should look upon this as a great favor.}
<A>__{kafka starts walking the way a flick of the revolver indicates, the assistants flanking him.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{i don't want any favors from the castle just my rights.}
<C>__{ludwig}
<D>__{we answer directly to ekman, the senior partner he practically runs the castle. in a case like this you're better off dealing with the highest authority even though it's equally futile.}
<C>__{oskar}
<D>__{when you speak to him you have to lean quite near his right ear because the left doesn't work so well.}
<B>__{around the corner}
<A>__{they head up in the direction of the castle.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{for all your incompetence i was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me. you're very good ham actors.}
<C>__{oskar}
<D>__{ just doing our job.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{it's a farce.}
<C>__{ludwig}
<D>__{we think you'd better accept your position instead of pointlessly annoying us.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{what position? being prosecuted in a case like this means having already lost it.}
<C>__{oskar}
<D>__{still, we're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{close only by virtue of antithesis.}
<A>__{one of the assistants keeps making a show of wiping his brow, though it's by no means hot.}
<B>__{another street}
<A>__{kafka walks stiffly between the assistants, the three of them almost locked together as one unit, like lifeless matter.}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{my assistants. i should have known. nothing is given to me. i have to acquire everything.}
<C>__{oskar}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{it's all right to be sarcastic in private to us because we have a sense of humor but when we're up at the castle we suggest you don't make a fuss. it would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.}
<C>__{ludwig}
<D>__{frankly, we don't understand why you've even bothered pursuing this business.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{it would be more accurate to say that it has pursued me.}
<C>__{oskar}
<D>__{but your goal is so hard to reach. do you think the official network would surrender to one man? we would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.}
<C>__{ludwig}
<D>__{my mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that not even mentioning accidents the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.}
<A>__{kafka suddenly points at the ground.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{you've dropped some money.}
<A>__{the assistants immediately bend their heads to look and kafka bangs them together as hard as he can. the assistants sit on the ground in a stupefied daze while kafka's running footsteps echo around the dark street.}
