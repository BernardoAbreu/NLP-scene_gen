<A>__{the two of them sit in a quiet, corner booth of the tramway eatery that sits on the summit of san jacinto overlooking the lights of palm springs and the desert clear back to salton sea. chris is on a roll.}

<D>__{how old are you, mr. franz?}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{seventy nine years old.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{seventy nine...see, all due respect, but the real difference between people is the quality of their soul and not on how long they've trudged around like a dip shit.}
<A>__{ron laughs.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{but it's true.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{it is. no question about that.}
<A>__{ron continues to let chris vent.}

<D>__{the government's the same as my parents. they don't respect anybody. regulation. regulation. regulation. we can't do this. but they can do that. i mean, the hypocrisy of the whole...culture. makes me crazy. my father was having children with two women at the same time, and then has the gall to think that he can be of some guidance to me? make judgments on me? my mother, of course, goes along with all of it. keeps the secret, which of course, makes my whole life a fiction. everything i thought was, wasn't. they're such fools! fucking idiots!}

<D>__{sorry. i don't usually use that kind of language either. i just get so angry thinking about it.}
<A>__{ron reaches across the table. puts his sturdy hand on chris' shoulder.}

<D>__{you got a lot of passion, young man.}
