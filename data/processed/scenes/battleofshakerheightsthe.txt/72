<D>__{all right, all right. i'm going.}
<A>__{bart comes out in his pajamas to turn off the sprinkler. he looks up and freezes. kelly comes out of tabby's studio. he shuts the door carefully and walks around the pool. kelly doesn't see bart. bart doesn't say anything. he just watches kelly go.}

<A>__{kelly throws parts of his soldier's kit onto his bed from corners of the room. the canteen underhand. the jeep cap as a free throw. this is the best day of his life. until he finds his uniform crumpled up behind the door, still crusted with mud.}

<D>__{damn it. damn it.}
<A>__{he flops on his bed. but he can't help it. soon he's smiling again. he gets up, gathers up the uniform, and tears out of the room.}
