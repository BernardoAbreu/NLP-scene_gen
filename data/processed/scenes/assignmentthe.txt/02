<A>__{angle on close on the man whom we will come to know as carlos. he lights the cigarette and takes a thirsty drag sucking the smoke deep into his lungs, glancing out at the street and alternately at the spider who tiptoes down to her prey. he watches the spider envelop the still living victim with her spindly legs. then he takes another drag on the cigarette and the ash glows bright, a burning ember which he touches ever so slowly to the spider's body. it sizzles.}

<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{i mean get out.}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{you're a pig, you know that? how can you be like that?}
<A>__{carlos crosses to her slowly. he runs his hand across her cheek, then down across her throat. death is in his eyes.}

<P>__{(barely above a whisper)}
<D>__{leave without saying another word.}
