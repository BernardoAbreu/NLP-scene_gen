<L>__{interior hannah's dining room night}
<A>__{elliot, hannah, and the twins sit at the dining room table. a christmas tree stands in the corner of the room, next to a table holding a lamp; a picture hangs on the wall. the family has just finished eating; the table is cluttered with the remains of dinner, including a quart of milk, some chocolate syrup, and a bottle of ketchup. hannah's two adopted children stand by her chair; she is showing them how a small camera works. the children watch her, fascinated, muttering among themselves. elliot looks listless. he stares blankly at the table.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(to her adopted children, holding the camera)}
<D>__{oh, you just have to read the instructions. i mean, you just set one of these things and you can take, you can take pictures underwater.}

<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{yeah! okay.}
<A>__{the adopted children leave, the twins going off with them. when they're gone, hannah takes a sip of her coffee and looks at elliot. she puts down her cup, still watching him.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{are you in a bad mood?}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(shaking his head slightly)}

<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(edgily)}
<D>__{because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.}
