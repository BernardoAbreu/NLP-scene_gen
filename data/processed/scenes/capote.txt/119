<L>__{interior ksp, death row day}
<A>__{the second floor of a small building in the corner of the prison complex. decrepit. the one hall is lit by mesh covered bare bulbs in the ceiling. twelve cells six on each side. each is 7 by 10 feet, with one small, high window covered by bars and wire. the young prison guard opens the heavy gate at the end of the hall and shows truman in. they walk down the row of cells. in one of them we notice lowell lee andrews (20, white, spectacled, enormously fat) peering at his own face 4 inches from a mirror. dick is leaning against the bars of his own cell. he smiles.}

<C>__{hickock}
<D>__{ask me, he's just trying to prove the insanity defense.}
<A>__{truman sees perry, gaunt, lying on his cot, almost comatose. perry's rather striking drawing of a large yellow parrot sits propped on his table. an uneaten lunch tray lies on the floor a cockroach runs over it. truman watches, disturbed.}
