<A>__{jake is hauled roughly toward neytiri's village, which is sheltered inside one of the great trees. hometree is 250 meters tall, with a trunk four times the diameter of the largest sequoia, and a base of massive mangrove pillars. tsu'tey rides inside the columns at the base of hometree, shouting an ululating warning. jake is force marched through the pillars into }
<L>__{interior commons hometree night}
<A>__{an open central area. the villagers gather to see the arriving hunt party. we see the people of the tribe mothers with babies, old women, young hunters. they gawk at the alien, expressions ranging from curiosity to outright hostility. the huge eyes of the children follow him. jake is amazed at the size of hometree inside. by the light of the cook fires he can see up into a vast cylindrical gallery a living cathedral. clear membranes sturmbeest bladders filled with fluttering bio luminescent insects, act as area lighting. the central space is dominated by the skull of some enormous creature, mounted with much embellishment on a totem. standing in front of this, awaiting their approach, is eytukan (ay too kahn), the clan leader. eytukan has deeply chiselled features and a long chest mantle of thanator claws. his normally stern features are clouded further by anger.}

<D>__{why do you bring this creature here?}
<A>__{neytiri addresses eytukan in na'vi.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<P>__{(subtitled)}
<D>__{i was going to kill him, but there was a sign from eywa.}
<A>__{he glowers at her as he responds, pointing at jake.}

<P>__{(subtitled)}
<D>__{i have said no dreamwalker will come here, to offend our home! his alien smell fills my nose}
<A>__{neytiri stands her ground, answering in a respectful but not submissive tone.}

<D>__{father, many atokirina came to this alien.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{my father is deciding whether to kill you.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{your father!?}
<P>__{(to eytukan)}
<D>__{uh, good to meet you, sir.}
<A>__{jake steps forward, offering his hand, and the hunters jump to restrain him, shouting. but they all freeze as a commanding female voice echoes through the chamber.}
<C>__{mo'at}
<P>__{(na'vi)}
<D>__{step back!}
<A>__{everybody looks up. mo'at (moh aht) stands on the second level, looking down. she is a severe woman in her 50's. her bearing is haughty, her expression friendly as a hanging judge. her outfit is elaborate, denoting her rank as clan matriarch.}
<C>__{mo'at}
<P>__{(subtitled)}
<D>__{i will look at this alien.}
<A>__{there is an expectant hush as mo'at descends the helical core of hometree, a kind of natural spiral staircase.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{that is mother. she is tsahik the one who interprets the will of eywa.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{who's eywa?}
<A>__{neytiri kneels before her like an acolyte as mo'at passes. the villagers stare silently as the matriarch circles slowly around jake, examining his tail and the end of his queue.}

<P>__{(thick accent)}
<D>__{what are you called?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{jake sully.}
<A>__{she produces a long thorn between her fingertips. with a flourish she strikes his chest. jake flinches. red blood wells up and mo'at rubs some between her fingertips. she tastes it.}
<C>__{mo'at}
<D>__{why did you come to us?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i came to learn.}
<C>__{mo'at}
<D>__{we have tried to teach other sky people. it is hard to fill a cup which is already full.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{my cup is empty, trust me. just ask doctor augustine. i'm no scientist.}
<C>__{mo'at}
<D>__{what are you?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i don't know. i was a marine uh, a warrior. of the jarhead clan.}

<D>__{a warrior! i could kill him easily!}

<P>__{(subtitled)}
<D>__{he is your responsibility.}
<A>__{neytiri nods, accepting, but she's not a happy camper. she grabs jake's arm and pulls him roughly away.}
