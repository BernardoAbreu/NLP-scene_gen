<L>__{interior van night}
<A>__{wall to wall surveillance set up. two fbi agents: donald carruthers 30's and richard messner 30's, man the post, staring at video monitors. both hold telephoto images; shaky, long lens shots of a mansion some distance away. messner tacks photographs to a corkboard on the van wall. one is labeled "subject sidney k. serna: underboss sparazza family." the other is labeled "subject victor "baby buzz" padiche lieutenant sparazza family." voices begin emitting over the van's speakers.}

<P>__{(keying mic)}
<D>__{zoom and pan please. stay tight.}
<A>__{on the monitors: the image pans, follows a figure moving behind the mansion's windows, entering a back bedroom.}
<C>__{serna }
<D>__{alright, now buzzy this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till i'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.}
<C>__{padiche }

<C>__{padiche }
<D>__{ he's doing it then, huh }
<C>__{serna }
<D>__{ yeah, now lemme finish, i was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose }
<C>__{padiche }
<D>__{ okay, g'head }
<C>__{serna}
<D>__{so what i heard downstairs there is that they got a guy, some swede, real badass, supposedly a "specialist" and they're bringing him over. now he ain't coming cheap so, i'm thinkin' we jump, do this in the next day or so, get to israel before the swede can, we got chits, y'see? we're in a power position. grab him, ransom him back, pick up that nut, we're that much closer to having our own thing.}
<C>__{padich }
<D>__{ i see that, yeah, s'smart move, for us anyway.}
<C>__{serna }
<D>__{trust me, we keep our mouths shut, go about our thing, play the part, nobody suspects us.}
<P>__{(feedback distorts)}
<D>__{the old man's on the fade buzzy, fuck him, y'know? and that hurts, i don't like saying that, but hey, our livelihood, our lifeboat, y'get?}
<C>__{padiche}
<D>__{no question, no, you're right. we gotta do what's good for us now.}
<C>__{serna }
<D>__{fuckin' a, first survive, yes?}
<C>__{padiche }
<D>__{y'gotta, y'gotta. but d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.}
<C>__{serna }
<D>__{yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before i get to it, one more thing i heard, little curious, should probably bring it up...primo wants israel's heart. the actual thing, the organ.}
<A>__{pause. feedback. the agents trade looks. carruthers grabs a cellphone, dials, patches a feed for the party on the other end to hear.}
<C>__{padiche }
<D>__{...jesus...what for?}
<C>__{serna }
<D>__{ who can say. he's off his onion, y'know, he's old school sicilian, this is how they hate.}
<C>__{padiche }
<D>__{wow.}
<C>__{serna }
<D>__{hey, we nab israel, they pay t'get'm back, i will cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. my thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some zip off the boat from naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.}
<C>__{padiche }
<D>__{yeah, there's a pair'a broads i'm thinking might be good for this.}
<C>__{serna }
<D>__{chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.}
<C>__{padiche }
<D>__{that's not a problem. are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?}
<C>__{serna}
<D>__{yeah, i can front this.}
