<A>__{...rachel's hand as a beautiful antique ring is slipped on her finger. she is asleep. then, she... ...stirs, wakes. stares at her hand in shock and delight.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{oh my god. are you serious?}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(tenderly)}
<D>__{i think so...what do you think?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i think so too...}
<A>__{they hold each other for a long time.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it's forever you know.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(trying to read him)}
<D>__{okay...is that the good thing or the bad thing?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{because i can't hurt anyone like this ever again.}
<A>__{she grins.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{how did you hurt someone? she threw you out, remember?}
<A>__{he does. she hugs him tight.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{everything's gonna work out. the kids and i...we're going to love each other.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{rache, it may take time.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what's eight, ten years? hell, you'll still be ambulatory. i think.}
<A>__{she's counting on her fingers. he kisses her.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{it's inevitable. look, i was defensive, i was insecure. i was afraid to love first.}
<A>__{her incredible smile. filling even luke with confidence.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{but i'm not anymore.}
<A>__{a sudden horrific crashing sound. the breakage of the breakable. their look holds.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i will get this.}
<A>__{a quick kiss. and she's gone. hold on luke's light smile. maybe this will all work out.}
