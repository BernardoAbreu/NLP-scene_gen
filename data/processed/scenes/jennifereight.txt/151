<L>__{150: interior interrogation room. police station. day.}
<A>__{if the waiting room felt bad try sitting in here. both st anne and taylor are smoking and the sony playing again. this is the final part of the tape. no speech but a lot of labored breath ing. ross groaning and now the sound of his shotgun. more desp erate inhalations and now sound of the last shot into his neck.}
<D>__{st anne .. and that one's with malice .. that one's first degree .. why don't you stop lying to me?}
<P>__{(clicks sony off)}
<D>__{c'mon, john, i can help you? why don't you tell me the truth?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i've told you the truth. it isn't me .. i've never call ed ross "freddy" in my life ..}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i've heard you call him freddy.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{you haven't. and you got no voice in here, taylor, so keep it shut. st anne tell a lotta lies, don't you? some thing that comes naturally to you?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i don't lie. st anne prepared to lie to your chief?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{under exceptional circumstances. st anne what were the circumstances that caused you to lie to freddy ross?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i never lied to ross .. st anne you didn't?}
<A>__{shakes his head in confirmation. and st anne finds a notebook.}
<D>__{well, he thought you did? .. wrote it down in his book? "john berlin is a liar." right here, underlined.}
<A>__{berlin stares at the book & can barely credit what he's seeing.}
<D>__{dated the day you got your first "break" with your "mystery man?" you don't know why he wrote that?}
<P>__{(he doesn't)}
<D>__{maybe he thought there was no "myst ery man?" that the investigation was bullshit? that you were making it up?}
<A>__{and during the next attack st anne will work himself into rage.}
<D>__{coz you wanted to be "top cop?" isn't that why you went running up that gar bage dump, so everyone could stand in awe of the "top cop?" isn't that why you came up here? coz you couldn't make it in l.a.? get yourself a pissy lit tle degree, come up here, and be "top guy?" but ross was "top guy", wasn't he? always would be top guy? and you know what? he did it without even trying .. everybody loved him. he had everything you wanted, didn't he? great woman great kid? everything you couldn't have? and you wanted it to go away? coz your life was lousy, wasn't it? a lousy life, with a lousy wife, who was fucking everyone, wasn't she? is that why you pick on a little blind girl? coz you can control her? is that it? control who she's fucking?}
<A>__{tears of grief and tears of rage. berlin can't restrain either.}
<D>__{you wanna lose your temper with me? c'mon, john, lose your fucken temper? you're good at losing your temper?..}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{no way, mr st anne. st anne lost your temper with ross, didn't you? c'mon, tell me the truth. is that what happened? you had an arg ument in the car? lost your temper with him? stood over him, blew his fucking larynx out with a glaser? where were you aiming, john? going for his face? blow his fucking face away, because you hated him so much.}
<A>__{berlin is a wreck of despair. but somehow he keeps his dignity.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i loved that guy .. & the hard est thing to take in here .. is knowing he thought i killed him .. st anne well, that he did .. and that do i, sergeant berlin ..}
<A>__{and at last he looks pleased. because he's got this man busted.}
<D>__{what do you take for that breathlessness, sergeant?}
<A>__{can't take anymore questions. answers with a shake of his head.}
<D>__{how about aminophylline?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i don't know what that is. st anne you don't? it's ant anti asthma medic ation, prescribed for breathlessness?}
<A>__{produces a capsule in a plastic bag and throws it on the table.}
<D>__{came out of the ashtray of your car?}
<A>__{every cell in berlin's body freezes. misinterpreted by st anne.}
<D>__{but you "don't know" what it is?}
<A>__{but he does know what it is. the pill he found in the v.w. van.}
<D>__{you don't know how it got there?}
<A>__{taylor stares a rock drill and st anne stares something similar.}
<D>__{you don't use it for breathlessness?}
<A>__{berlin focuses a fragment of hope. but no sign of hope in here.}
<D>__{i'm running outta questions, john, and you're running out of lies? i'm offer ing you one last chance, and you better take it, or the u.s. attorney is gonna put you in the god damned gas chamber ..}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i need .. some time .. to think sir .. st anne alright. think about it. but don't you make a fool of me. you come in here with one more lie, and i bull shit you not, i'm gonna press for the maximum penalty there is. and that's the death penalty, sergeant.}
