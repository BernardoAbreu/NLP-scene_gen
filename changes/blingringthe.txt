A loud song kicks in as they put their sweatshirt hoods up in unison and turn around and walk backwards toward the house. They've done this before, they have it down. One checks under the mat of the front door, we follow them as they go around to the back, checking doors, and find a back window open. A guy gives Girl 1 a lift up, we see her bright underwear as she climbs inside into a laundry room. She runs around to open a side door for the rest, and they slip inside. Once inside, we follow REBECCA into a bedroom dressing area. She is the 17 yr-old Korean-American ring-leader, who is totally cool and composed. She looks over her shoulder at the others with a raised eye- brow.}

We see the other kids grabbing things and loading up bags. Rebecca puts on a hat she finds and looks at herself in a mirror posing, then gets back to it.}

T.V. image of a starlet on the red carpet posing for pictures. CLOSE UP: on a stack of shiny diamond necklaces. A Facebook page with party photo of one of the girls, Chloe in a slutty outfit, with tattooed thug, and the quote "Wanna smoke a bluuuunt". Pan across Calabassas McMansions.}
