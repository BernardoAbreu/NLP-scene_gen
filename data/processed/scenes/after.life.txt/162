<L>__{interior funeral home. prep room evening}
<A>__{anna watches eliot brush an invisible speck off her mother's black dress.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{you did well this morning.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{this morning?}
<A>__{she talks with difficulty now. her voice slurred and hoarse. her words muddled and rambling. her eyes even more sunken. her skin even more pale.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{when paul came. you did the right thing. you let him go.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{he'll be all right now? won't he?}
<A>__{eliot looks away. doesn't reply. he drapes the dress over his arm, picks up a pair of shiny black shoes and moves over to her.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{why do i have to get dressed?}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{tomorrow's your funeral.}
<A>__{eliot lifts anna's arms and puts them through the sleeves of the dress. her body's stiff and unyielding.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{already?}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{i told you. you only had three days.}
<A>__{he delicately turns her onto her side. buttons up the dress.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{i told you to use your time well.}
<A>__{anna frowns. as if trying to remember something. eliot gently lifts her legs. pulls on a pair of black tights.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i need to... i have so many regrets. i have nothing but regrets.}
<A>__{she looks up at him. suddenly realizing.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{that's why i'm here isn't it? to be judged.}
<A>__{eliot picks up anna's shoes. slips them onto her stiff feet.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{you're here to understand your life. so you can finally be at peace.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i wanted a different life.}
<A>__{eliot picks up a nail clipper. gently holds anna's hand as he carefully cuts her long nails.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{then why didn't you do anything about it?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no matter what i did everything just stayed the same. i'd wake up. i'd shower. sit in the same traffic everyday on my way to work. go home. go to sleep. then wake again.}
<A>__{eliot stops clipping her nails. irritated.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{what did you really want from life?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i just wanted to be happy.}
<C>__{eliot}
<P>__{(derisively)}
<D>__{happy? you all say you wanted to be happy. what does it mean anna? to be happy?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i don't know. don't you understand? that's the whole pointerior i don't know.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{yes you do! you're just too scared to admit it to yourself.}
<A>__{anna turns away ashamed. she knows he's right.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i don't want to talk about it anymore. i just want this to be over.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{what did you want from life?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i don't fucking know!}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{what did you want anna?}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(screams back)}
<D>__{i wanted love! ok!}
<A>__{anna's stunned. she's finally admitted it.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i wanted love.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{you had love. paul loved you.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no. you don't understand. i was scared. i wanted to love but i didn't know how. i was...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{when i was a child... my mother.}
<A>__{anna struggles to pull together her thoughts.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{when i was a child. i learnt that love. that when you love someone. you get hurt. so i learned not to love. that way no one could ever hurt me again.}
<A>__{she looks down at the slab. touches the cold marble.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i was always pushing paul away. he thought i didn't love him.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{did you?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{he was the only one i ever loved. but i never told him that. and then he stopped loving me.}
<A>__{eliot stares at her intently. comes to a decision.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{what would you do if you had another chance?}
<A>__{anna's puzzled. eliot goes to the door and unlocks it. moonlight floods in from upstairs. washing it with a cold light. anna doesn't move.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{well? isn't this what you wanted?}
<A>__{eliot holds out his hand. anna takes it hesitantly and rises from the slab.}
