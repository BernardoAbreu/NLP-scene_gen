<L>__{interior law office day}
<A>__{ben sits behind his desk, sifting through a pile of papers. we pan around to anna sitting across from him.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i know it's here somewhere. i spoke to george lane in music, and he gave me this whole list of references for you.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's cool. you can call me when you find it.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i swear i didn't lure you here under false pretenses.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i know. but a girl can dream.}
<A>__{he looks up at her and smiles.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{you're obviously too good of a guy.}
<A>__{they share a long look.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{why are you married, again?}
<A>__{ben laughs.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{seriously. why? it'll be good for me. tell me how you decided that you could not be without this other woman.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{we'd been together since college. she gave me an ultimatum: we get married or we break up. so, we got married.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{seriously? you just caved?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it's complicated.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you're a dick if you date a girl for too long, and don't marry her. but you marry her, and then you're an asshole for marrying her before you're ready. shit i don't know.}
<A>__{he looks at her.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{you're really hot and i'm obviously attracted to you, but i guess the best i can do is eventually find this piece of paper, and call you, and hope i help in some small way with your career, and be happy about that.}
<A>__{anna takes this in.}
