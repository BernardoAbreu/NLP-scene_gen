<D>__{no thanks.}
<A>__{she turns and walks toward the highway. the parade tape has been replaced with crowd barriers. the drive's left side now overflows with abolitionists: they cluster beneath tarps, some sing hymns, others paint signs ("don't kill with my taxes!", "mark 6:10," "murder doesn't stop murder!"). beneath one umbrella stands a large black woman holding a candle she watches bitsey. the right side is a media circus. various pro death penalty activists also cluster here. they too have prepared signs: "rape and suffocate him!", "thank jesus for justice," "'let's do it'." a blackboard keeps a countdown: "13 hours." at the end of the drive, on the left, bitsey sees a sign leaning against a camper: "save david gale." it catches rain; its letters run.}
