<L>__{interior hallway after dawn}
<A>__{camera is positioned at far end of hallway, looking down it at the elevator at the other end. ted walks out of the penthouse in the f.g. in a medium shot, he takes the thousand dollars in his hand, looks at it, smiles, and sticks it in his pocket. it might've been a bad night, but it's been a profitable one. he chuckles at the irony, and, whistling a happy tune, turns his back on the camera and walks down the hall to the elevator. all the while we hear pandemonium breaking out behind the door. as ted walks to the elevator, the credits roll. he waits for the elevator, it arrives, he gets in, the doors close. as credits continue to roll, we hold for about two beats... then... the door bursts open and everybody comes piling out. everybody's screaming, yelling different things to one another. norman has a bloody towel wrapped around his hand, he's screaming and crying.}

<D>__{my finger, my fucking finger!!}
<A>__{chester has the bucket of ice with the finger in it. leo's trying to direct everything. everybody's in frantic activity, except for angela, who stands back, drinks her drink, and watches the show. they all run down the hall, toward the elevator. somebody trips and they all hit the ground. the bucket of ice with the finger goes spilling. they run around like crazy, looking for the finger and picking up ice cubes. norman lies on the floor and screams. they pick it all up, get to the elevator, and push the button. when it arrives, they all dive in except for angela.}
