<L>__{exterior base camp dawn}
<A>__{a beautiful sunrise backs the treeline, stretching long shadows across the quiet camp.}
<L>__{interior kirkhill's trailer}
<A>__{the interior resembles that of a motor home, complete with bunks, kitchenette and a small bar. kirkhill is on the phone, pacing... agitated. his reptilian aide lounges on a bunk.}
<C>__{kirkhill}
<P>__{(to phone)}
<D>__{no, sir... we're already committed. they're in the jungle right now. i say we play the hand through... if they find something we just bury the report later. it's still airtight.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{he hangs up. runs a hand through his hair.}
<C>__{kirkhill}
<P>__{(to aide)}
<D>__{goddamn it! now the goddamn satellite shows the camp occupied... some trucks or something.}
<C>__{aide}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{oh, boy. it's getting dicey.}
<A>__{their manner becomes guarded when a knock at the door interrupts them. the aide unlocks it and admits trautman.}
<C>__{kirkhill}
<D>__{what's up?}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{listen, kirkhill. i'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... i thought i'd go out with the extraction team tonight. unless you have an objection.}
<C>__{kirkhill}
<P>__{(not liking it)}
<D>__{it's not necessary.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{kirkhill}
<D>__{that's a pretty hairy ride. full colonels are supposed to be above that sort of thing.}
<A>__{trautman is calling him on it with a deadpan response.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{i know...}
<C>__{kirkhill}
<P>__{(shrugs expansively)}
<D>__{have fun.}
