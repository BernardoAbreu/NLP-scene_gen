<A>__{ramirez, blain and billy race down the back stairs of the palapa, firing mini gun, automatic and grenade rounds at the escaping guerrillas as they flee the area, splashing, charging across the shallow river. the guerrillas are history...in no uncertain terms.}

<A>__{for the first time, schaefer studies the interior of the cavernous palapa, seeing the enormous stockpile of weapons, equipment and supplies stacked along the walls, obviously a major military stronghold hidden deep within the mountains. mac hustles up to schaefer, a look of urgency on his face.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{any sign of the hostages?}
<C>__{mac}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{we found 'em both, dead. and the gear from the chopper. if they're central american, i'm a fuckin' chinaman. by the looks of 'em, i'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are cia.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{another thing, major, we were lucky...couple of those guys we waxed are russians, military advisors by the look of it. something big was about to happen here.}
<A>__{schaefer looks at mac a moment, a flush of anger beginning to show.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{good work, mac. clear the area, no traces. get the men ready to move.}
<A>__{schaefer goes back into the room, looking down at the unconscious guerrilla, racking a round into the chamber, reloading his weapon. he kneels, staring into the face of a woman, anna, dark, late twenties. despite her blood and dirt smeared face, she is beautiful.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<P>__{(closes eyes)}
<D>__{shit...}
<A>__{he checks her pulse and then slowly he bends to pick up her pistol, ejecting the clip. he stands, beginning to shuffle through the papers scattered about the room. staring at one he looks up, the pieces falling together.}
