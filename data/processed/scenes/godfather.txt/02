<A>__{a high angle of the corleone mall in bright daylight. there are at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard and gardens. there is music and laughing and dancing and countless tables covered with food and wine. don corleone stands at the gate, flanked on either side by a son: fredo and sonny, all dressed in the formal attire of the wedding party. he warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the hands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the children, and makes them all welcome. they in turn carry with them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked bread and pastries, and enormous trays of italian delicacies. the entire family poses for a family portrait: don corleone, mama, sonny, his wife, sandra, and their children, tom hagen and his wife, theresa, and their baby; constanzia, the bride, and her bridegroom, carlo rizzi. as they move into the pose, the don seems preoccupied.}
