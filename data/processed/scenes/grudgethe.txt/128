<L>__{interior college peter's office day (three years ago)}
<A>__{the same group photo is in a frame on peter's desk. peter stands behind the desk, using a small mirror to knot his tie. his open door reads: `department of english'. a co worker (20s, japanese) enters with a stack of mail.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{happy monday. co worker yeah, right. here's your mail.}
<A>__{he hands it to peter. on the top is a small blue envelope. the name in the return address is `kayako'.}
<D>__{co worker another one, huh?}
<A>__{peter shakes his head, looking distastefully at the letter.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i don't even know her. she says i used to tutor her, but i don't know who the hell she is.}
<A>__{the co worker shrugs and leaves. disturbed, peter fingers the blue envelope. his eyes go to one of his desk drawers. he slides it open. more blue envelopes are inside. all from `kayako'. peter's face darkens. he dumps the letters into a trash can.}
