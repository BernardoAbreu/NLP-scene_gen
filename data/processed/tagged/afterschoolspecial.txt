<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{interior william wall high school hallway day}
<A>__{as we wind down the crowded hallway in this typical american high school...}
<B>__{another corridor}
<A>__{...we hear all the sounds of a standard porno flick, from the unenthusiastic screams of fake ecstasy to the cheesy music.}
<L>__{interior william wall high school auditorium day}
<A>__{the sounds echo in the empty hall. behind the stage a light from an open door...}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{this is unwatchable. it's not even in focus. and geez, look, the boom mike is in the shot. this is really shoddy work.}
<L>__{interior william wall high school a v room day}
<A>__{the door leads into this room, as we continue on to a tv monitor displaying a sweaty guy's ugly face.}
<C>__{deacon }
<D>__{why do they always show the guy's face? it's like, can't we just assume he's enjoying it?}
<A>__{we slowly pull back from the tv.}
<C>__{fred }
<D>__{because they're trying to make us feel like we're better looking than that guy, so we should be able to get chicks as hot as her.}
<C>__{deacon }
<D>__{how the hell do you know?}
<C>__{fred }
<D>__{it's a basic rule of porno.}
<A>__{finally, we reveal our three heroes: matt, fred, and deacon. they're watching the porno...}
<L>__{interior william wall high school a v room day}
<A>__{... before school with the sound turned way down, but you can still hear the porno. the three guys are sitting with their book bags on their laps to conceal any possible bonerage.}
<C>__{deacon }
<D>__{it all started on my seventeenth birthday with our usual morning routine: film appreciation. the school bell rings and deacon clicks off the tv.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{deacon! what are you doing? i was watching that.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{come on, let's go. we're going to be late. deacon (v.o.) (cont'd) and when i say film appreciation, i mean film duplication. fred steals them, matt copies them, and i sell them. matt walks over to the tv and presses eject on five vcr's. the original plus four copies pop out. close on the original tape: "ramalot productions presents dirty darla #7," as matt hands it to fred and the copies to deacon. they smile.}
<L>__{interior william wall high school cafeteria day}
<D>__{the guys are waiting in line for lunch.}
<C>__{deacon }
<D>__{fred's the kind of kid who's basically given up on high school. he figures his glory days are way ahead of him.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{first, i go to yale, then harvard law, then when i'm making a hundred grand a year, i will have a whole stable of hot chicks sitting around topless on my yacht. he smiles ears to ear, looking for approval.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(to deacon)}
<D>__{will that work?}
<C>__{deacon}
<P>__{(to fred)}
<D>__{you are a complete moron. deacon and matt walk off. fred calls after them.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{what?}
<L>__{interior william wall high school hallway day}
<D>__{the video monitors up and down the hallways display an image that reads "fifteen days till midterms." fred sees two amazing girls walking towards him.}
<C>__{deacon }
<D>__{until that big payday, fred's sex life consists of spanking it.}
<C>__{amazing girl}
<D>__{that test was sooo hard. that's too much for fred to take. he adjusts his pants, turns ninety degrees, and makes a beeline for:}
<L>__{interior boys' bathroom day}
<D>__{fred looks under the stalls to make sure no one's in there, then enters a stall and locks the door. he puts his book bag down, then places a protector on the toilet seat and sits down. he pulls a large wad of toilet paper off the roll. then, from out of the book bag, fred pulls a bottle of moisty mate hand lotion. he smiles.}
<L>__{interior william wall high school hallway day}
<D>__{fred is walking to class when he spots a hot girl, rubbing a stain off of her shirt. another hot girl grabs her arm.}
<C>__{hot girl}
<D>__{we're going to be late. are you coming? fred perks up.}
<L>__{interior boys' bathroom day}
<D>__{fred walks into the stall and grabs the toilet protector.}
<C>__{deacon }
<D>__{fred averages two to five time a day, depending on how many girls he sees in the hallway.}
<L>__{interior william wall high school hallway day}
<P>__{matt is videotaping the students (including j.t. and mark)}
<D>__{running down the hallway to class. fred watches.}
<C>__{deacon }
<D>__{now matt matt's what you'd call a late bloomer. secretary of the audio visual club, amateur filmmaker, and complete dork.}
<A>__{j.t. and mark grab matt's camera and film each other flipping him off. matt grabs it back and the twins walk away laughing. fred shakes his head.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{all great directors start this way. i'm documenting the essence of high school. teenagers running to meet their destiny only to find it's just home room. it's very existential.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{so's my balls. see you later.}

<L>__{interior outside the locker rooms day}
<A>__{matt trudges into the locker room area, holding a towel to his bloody nose.}
<C>__{deacon }
<D>__{in the normal course of things, matt probably wouldn't even have been our friend, but fred likes having someone to boss around, and i think matt's actually pretty cool once you get to know him.}
<A>__{just then, the burly girls' swim team coach comes out of the girls' locker room. she walks by matt without noticing, and the door to the locker room closes slowly. matt's attention is drawn to it. the door stops with a creak, a sliver of daylight still visible. matt shakes his head and starts to walk away towards the boys' locker room. then, he stops. he's torn. he's still too immature to really be interested, but he thinks he should be. he looks around quickly, then slowly approaches the door. he turns his head sideways, and places it up against the crack. matt's pov the proverbial jackpot. teenage girls changing. bras. panties. towels...}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{matt's eyes widen. and then, they close tight. he quickly scurries away.}
<P>__{deacon (cont'd; v.o.)}
<D>__{well, at least he's got the key to the a v room.}
<L>__{interior william wall high school hallway day}
<A>__{deacon talks quietly to a dorky freshman.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{dirty darla #7 is a modern classic. this is grade a porn, my friend. worth a lot more than twenty dollars.}
<C>__{dorky freshman}
<D>__{sweet.}
<A>__{he hands him the money and deacon makes the exchange for the tape. the freshman clutches it like gold and scurries away. deacon heads out down the hallway towards his locker. he sees a gaggle of teenage girls gossiping.}
<C>__{deacon }
<D>__{people always talk about how tough it is being a teenage girl. i mean, if i have to watch one more tv movie about bulimia or self mutilation or vaginal dryness...}
<A>__{deacon reaches his locker and opens it. he sees some cheerleaders bouncing down the hallway. deacon takes out some books for class.}
<D>__{deacon (cont'd; v.o.) (cont'd) i will tell you what's really hard. being a seventeen year old boy. imagine what it's like to have only one thing on your mind all day, every day, but to have absolutely no way of getting it.}
<L>__{interior biology class day}
<A>__{close on a textbook showing the anatomy of the vagina. pull back to reveal deacon, seemingly staring into space, but really staring at...}
<C>__{deacon }
<D>__{testosterone is a drug more powerful than heroin. i don't really have any evidence to support that, but the point is, a horny teenage boy will do almost anything for even a glimpse of sex.}
<A>__{... his biology teacher's erect nipples visible through her conservative bra and blouse. aside from her flashing headlights, she's the kind of woman you wouldn't notice even if you were alone with her on a two man luge. but that doesn't matter deacon can't take his eyes off of them.}
<C>__{biology teacher}
<P>__{(in the background)}
<D>__{... the increase in the hormone testosterone causes certain physiological changes in the adolescent male...}
<C>__{deacon }
<D>__{we're suffering. suffering from a deep, debilitating addiction to something we've never even had. teenage boys are like time bombs, ready to explode.}
<B>__{behind deacon}
<A>__{two guys are whispering.}
<C>__{guy 1}
<D>__{did you hear about rachael?}
<C>__{guy 2}
<D>__{no, what happened?}
<C>__{guy 1}
<D>__{john baldwin nailed her.}
<A>__{deacon bolts upright and spins around, concerned.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{are you talking about rachael unger?}
<C>__{guy 1}
<D>__{yeah. it was at richard rosenblatt's party. in the bathroom.}
<C>__{deacon}
<P>__{(crushed)}
<D>__{you're kidding.}
<L>__{interior deacon's bedroom day (flashback)}
<A>__{rachael unger, deacon's girlfriend at the time, is naked under deacon's sheets after school one day. deacon enters from the bathroom and is immediately surprised by her state of undress.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{rachael! what are you doing?}
<A>__{she sits up and strikes a sexy pose.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{we've been together for a year now, and i thought it was time to take our relationship to the next level.}
<A>__{deacon is becoming very nervous.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{now?}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{you've been talking about this for months.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{i didn't think you were listening to me.}
<A>__{suddenly, rachael becomes a little self conscious.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{don't you want to?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{of course i do. but, i, um... i don't have anything...}
<A>__{she pulls out a condom.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{i do.}
<A>__{but he's still hesitating.}
<C>__{rachael }
<D>__{deacon, what's the problem?}
<A>__{deacon looks at her waiting there for him, his for the taking. an eternity passes. then,}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{i have a math test tomorrow.}
<L>__{interior biology class day (end flashback)}
<A>__{the teacher clears her throat and deacon snaps out of it. he turns away from the guys behind him as they continue to describe the john baldwin incident.}
<C>__{deacon }
<D>__{"i have a math test tomorrow." the bottom line is, i just couldn't do it. i don't know why, i just couldn't. and i've cursed myself every day since then.}
<A>__{deacon is suddenly...}
<L>__{interior william wall high school hallway day}
<A>__{... very depressed as he trudges to his locker. which is nothing compared to how he feels when he looks}
<B>__{down the hallway}
<A>__{and sees rachael at her locker, hugging some people good bye (including a good looking guy who must be john baldwin). rachael looks down the hallway towards deacon, but deacon ducks away. now he's even more embittered.}
<L>__{exterior william wall high school parking lot day}
<A>__{fred and matt are walking towards their bikes after school.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{did you videotape it?}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<D>__{yeah. i took my camera to gym class with me.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{you are the biggest moron i have ever known.}
<A>__{just then, deacon comes up to them.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{hey, guys. here's the money.}
<A>__{he hands out the proceeds from the operation, and matt notices that deacon is a little out of sorts.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{something wrong?}
<A>__{deacon lets out a deep breath.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{yeah. i heard rachael unger did it with john baldwin.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{well, you had your chance. i told you to seal that deal.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{shut up, fabio. i don't see you sealing any deals.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{i'm biding my time.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{whatever. it just wasn't good timing.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{it doesn't get any better than that. you and rachael were perfect for each other. and naked girls don't just appear out of thin air.}
<P>__{(scoffs)}
<D>__{"i have a math test tomorrow."}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{will you shut up already?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{look, i've been thinking about this all day. we're juniors now. upperclassmen.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{so?}
<A>__{they reach the bike rack and start unlocking their bikes.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{so we have a responsibility to ourselves to start having fun and getting girls. this year is our year.}
<P>__{(takes the chain off his bike)}
<D>__{there's nothing holding us back any more.}
<A>__{over in the parking lot, jake, a studly senior, revs the engine on his truck. two hot girls, kelly and wendy, sit on his bumper, chatting.}
<C>__{deacon }
<D>__{you see? that's exactly what i'm talking about. that could be us.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{that's not going to be us this year, or next year, or any year, ever.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{why not? all we have to do is follow the simple lessons of tony montana in "scar face."}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{ooh. good movie.}
<C>__{deacon and matt}
<P>__{(with cuban accents)}
<D>__{"first you get the money, then you get the power, then you get the women."}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{so, we're going to become cuban drug lords?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{listen, the porno pirating operation is bringing in plenty of money. when i get my new car tonight for my birthday, we'll have the power to go wherever we want. then, there's nothing stopping us from getting the girls.}
<A>__{fred and matt look at deacon warily. is this a plan? then, the hot girls and jake drive past the guys.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{bye, sphincter!}
<A>__{they laugh, then peel out with the radio blasting.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{nothing's going to change, deacon. you're still going to be the kid who shit his pants in fifth grade and no one will ever let you forget it.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{i had a stomach virus, asshole.}
<A>__{just then, a super hot cheerleader drops her car keys and bends over to pick them up.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{oh, that's just not fair.}
<A>__{fred adjusts himself.}

<L>__{interior video casa del russ a.k.a. russ's video magic day}
<A>__{fred arrives dressed for work (name tag, shirt, etc.) and waves to russ, the scraggly owner of this small video rental store. fred passes j.t., mark, wendy, and kelly and a bunch of other customers on his way to the back section of the store.}
<B>__{adult section}
<A>__{fred makes sure russ isn't looking and ducks into the porno section. hurriedly, he pulls out "half cyborg 5: final showdown" from his book bag. but inside the case is the tape for "dirty darla #7." he makes the switch. fred sighs a breath of relief, smiles, and walks out of the adult section...}
<B>__{main area}
<A>__{...right into...}
<C>__{russ}
<D>__{gotcha!}
<A>__{fred screams.}
<C>__{russ }
<D>__{i've been watching you.}
<A>__{russ grabs fred by the shoulders and throws him up against the shelf, shaking him with every word.}
<C>__{russ }
<D>__{those movies aren't for little monkey boys!}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{aaaaaahhhhhhhh!}
<A>__{the customers stop to stare at the scene. fred breaks free, and russ chases after him.}
<C>__{russ}
<D>__{come back here, you bastard!}
<A>__{russ runs after him and dives at fred's legs, knocking him and entire shelf of tapes over. the tape fly everywhere. fred is still screaming. russ starts shouting at fred so that everyone can hear. a crowd gathers around to watch the spectacle.}
<C>__{russ }
<D>__{what else you got in here?}
<A>__{russ rips open fred's bag and pulls out items, looking for more tapes. fred tries to stop him, but the old man has an iron grip and keeps him away. fred cringes as russ exposes porno magazines, kleenex tissues, baby wipes, the bottle of moisty mate firming lotion, q tips, women's sexy underwear, surgical gloves... wendy and kelly are completely grossed out.}
<C>__{russ }
<P>__{(totally confused)}
<D>__{what's this for?}
<A>__{...and a barbie type doll with a pullstring. russ pulls it.}
<C>__{doll}
<D>__{i'm candy. let's play dress up.}
<A>__{the crowd is now seriously disturbed.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{dude.}
<A>__{fred sits there, whimpering on the ground.}
<L>__{exterior suburban street day}
<A>__{deacon drives the dmv tester car under the watchful eye of the dmv tester.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{and i signal exactly two hundred feet before the turn. rule 108 1.}
<A>__{the unimpressed tester remains expressionless.}
<C>__{dmv tester}
<D>__{great. now after the right, i want you to parallel park in the open space.}
<A>__{deacon complies.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{i begin the parallel parking maneuver by pulling within three feet of the forward vehicle. i now shift into reverse while turning the wheel two revolutions clockwise...}
<A>__{the tester rubs his brow.}
<L>__{interior dmv day}
<A>__{flash! deacon's picture is taken. he passed.}

<L>__{interior deacon's house day}
<A>__{it's dark, but suddenly the lights come on.}
<C>__{everyone}
<D>__{surprise!}
<A>__{deacon pretends to be surprised.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{wow. this is great.}
<A>__{the room is sparsely populated with a few of deacon's relatives, his mom and dad, younger brother max (14), and roger, a wheelchair bound nerd with a face full of orthodontic headgear and braces.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{were you surprised?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{really. i was.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{happy birthday, deacon. it's lois lane #2. be careful. it's still in the wrapper.}
<A>__{he hands deacon a comic book, still in the plastic bag.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{thanks.}
<L>__{interior deacon's house later}
<A>__{half eaten cake and ice cream, unwrapped presents. matt videotapes the event.}
<C>__{mr. lewis}
<D>__{are you ready for the big present?}
<C>__{deacon}
<P>__{(laying it on thick)}
<D>__{you mean there's more?}
<A>__{deacon can hardly contain his excitement.}
<C>__{mr. lewis}
<D>__{it's in the garage. come with us.}
<A>__{he follows them, looking back knowingly at fred and matt.}
<L>__{interior deacon's house garage day (continuous)}
<A>__{the door opens, the lights come on, and deacon's face drops. no new car. instead, several large wrapped boxes. deacon halfheartedly rips open the paper.}
<C>__{mr. lewis}
<D>__{it's a new computer system. you've been talking about it for months.}
<A>__{but his mom can see his expression.}
<C>__{mrs. lewis}
<D>__{what? that's not what you wanted?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{no, it is. it's just }
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i will take it.}
<C>__{mrs. lewis}
<D>__{max!}
<C>__{mr. lewis}
<D>__{we can exchange it if it's not the right one.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{no, i just thought i thought you guys were buying me that car i wanted.}
<A>__{max snickers.}
<C>__{mrs. lewis}
<D>__{a car? why do you need a car?}
<C>__{mr. lewis}
<D>__{you can ask permission to use our car whenever you want, champ.}
<A>__{they put their arms around deacon and smile warmly. deacon looks over at his parents' aerostar minivan. everyone moves back into the house, except deacon's parents, who linger.}
<C>__{mr. lewis }
<D>__{i told you he didn't want a new computer.}
<C>__{mrs. lewis}
<D>__{like you know what anyone in this house really wants.}

<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{you invited more people?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{well, we did send out flyers to like three hundred people from school.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{and no one showed up?}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{i did.}
<A>__{deacon looks back at roger.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{great.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{uh, guys. no one showed up because they're all at tom cooperman's house. he's having a keg party.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{what? why didn't i hear about this? that shit's not right.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{i heard it from rahim. he beamed me the 411 in study hall.}
<A>__{a beat. deacon's anger turns to action.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{let's go.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{yeah. tom cooperman kicked me in the balls in third grade, and i swear there is still a footprint on my nutsack.}

<C>__{fred}
<D>__{she looks good.}
<A>__{and there's naomi, every teenage boy's fantasy, wearing a hot party dress and drinking a cup of beer. someone lightly bumps her... close on her lips as the beer dribbles down her chin, and the world goes still . she playfully wipes the beer off her moistened lips and chin with the back of her hand. she turns her head and her hair floats in the air.}
<B>__{deacon and fred}
<A>__{are zombies, completely mesmerized by her.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{she spilled her beer.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{fred adjusts his pants. deacon makes a decision. one that he'd normally never make.}

<D>__{your dignity?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{she's rachael's friend. it's not like i don't know her.}

<A>__{it's jake, back for another beer.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{hey, did you hear about rachael unger?}

<D>__{hey, guys.}

<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{he really pisses me off. jake is such an asshole.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{tell me about it.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{when we were going out, he was so mean to me all the time. i think he's compensating for his little dick that never even gets hard.}
<A>__{deacon chokes on his drink.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{well at least you were smart enough to dump him. i mean, you deserve someone who will treat you ... i don't know. really well.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{you know what you are?}
<A>__{deacon gets a little nervous.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{you're a nice guy.}
<A>__{she kisses him on the cheek. deacon looks at her, then steels himself to make a decision. he kisses her! she's surprised, but not unwilling.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{deacon?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{i've been wanting to do that for a long time.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{so why didn't you?}
<A>__{most guys would look away at this point, with a fabulous babe with pouty lips staring you down. but deacon passes the test: he stands his ground and kisses her again. she likes it. at a window, jake sees them kissing. he doesn't like it. at another window, fred sees it, too. and for a completely different reason, he doesn't like it either.}
<L>__{interior basement set day}

<D>__{hey, where's coop?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{he was supposed to be here a half hour ago.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{maybe he got sucked into a black hole.}
<A>__{he chuckles to himself.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{good one, spock. i can't understand why you're not more popular with the ladies.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{look, we're wasting time. deacon, why don't you just go in there?}
<A>__{deacon balks at first, then looks over at ashley, lying there.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{come on...}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{okay. okay. all right already.}
<A>__{he pulls off his shirt and approaches ashley with a pizza box from out of nowhere.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{and action!}
<A>__{matt starts filming while ashley pulls deacon near her.}
<C>__{ashley }
<D>__{maybe i can pay for the pizza some other way...}
<A>__{we hear deacon's zipper opening offscreen as deacon rolls his eyes and reluctantly delivers his line:}

<C>__{fred}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yeah, it'll be a great shot.}
<A>__{fred takes off his shorts and walks over to the other side of the bed. ashley is offscreen, presumably lying on the bed. the two guys are facing each other.}

<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{s'up?}
<C>__{fred}

<D>__{hey, did you see that show on sci fi about sun spots?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{yeah. they said there's going to be a massive eruption next year.}

<C>__{matt}
<D>__{hey, why don't you guys kiss?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you know. make out with each other.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{all right.}
<A>__{fred goes in to kiss deacon, who's thoroughly confused. deacon holds him back with his hand.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{wait. why do you want us to kiss?}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{because that's what guys do in gay porn.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{deacon looks over at the camera. it's ashley filming. panic! he slowly looks down at the person he and fred are having sex with. he can barely look. it's matt!}

<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{where the hell is coop? there's no way i'm making out with fred.}

<C>__{fred}
<D>__{no way. i'm holding the mike and that's it.}

<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you dreamed about making out with fred?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{no. well, yes. and we were both having sex with you. but it was just a dream so let's forget it.}
<A>__{everyone is a little uneasy at this admission. deacon quickly changes the subject.}
<C>__{deacon }
<D>__{what's with the light?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it's a "special effect." if you want this film to look amateurish, you're going to have to get someone else to do it.}

<D>__{make a wish.}
<A>__{deacon is too entranced to close his eyes, but he does take the opportunity to blow the eyelash off her hand. she smiles and brushes back a strand of hair from his brow. the guys are hooked. up through the window, over on deacon's computer, the a.s.s. website is running, featuring roger's smiling face with the motto, "by virgins, for virgins." the counter is on fire.}
