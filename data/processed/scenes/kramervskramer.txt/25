<A>__{as the door swings open to reveal ted kramer, an enormous grin on his face, a bottle of champagne in his hand. he is so full of himself that he doesn't notice there is anything wrong. note: throughout the entire scene he carries the bottle of champagne, never putting it down.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i thought you might just like to know that at five fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the fire and ice account by revlon.}

<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{here are my keys. i won't be needing them any more.}
<A>__{note: ted does not for a moment believe that his wife will really leave him. all he can think of right now is that he will have to spend the rest of the evening coping with one of her moods.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(sardonic)}
<D>__{i'm sorry i'm late, all right? i'm sorry i didn't call i was busy making a living.}

<P>__{(not bothering to look up)}
<D>__{i've paid the rent, the con ed and the phone bill, so you don't have to worry about them.}
<A>__{she checks off the last item on her list as her husband watches, dumbfounded.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{there, that's everything.}
<A>__{joanna gets to her feet and starts toward the front door. in an instant ted is after her.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(panic starting)}
<D>__{for god's sake, joanna, would you at least tell me what i did that's so terrible! would you do me that little favor?}

<A>__{at the door.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{look, it's not your fault, okay? it's me. it's my fault you just married the wrong person.}
<C>__{ted}
