<C>__{movie trailer voice }
<D>__{in our world.... in the 1800's...}
<A>__{pan on tv: the screen is all black.}
<C>__{movie trailer voice }
<D>__{... came the greatest revolution of them all.}
<P>__{(climactic music)}
<D>__{the industrial revolution.}
<A>__{the black fades to angelo badsmith, a middle aged african american man sitting before a fire in a green smoking jacket, holding a script.}
<C>__{movie trailer voice }
<D>__{written by famed screenwriter rob marlowe and read by oscar winning reader angelo badsmith.}
<C>__{angelo badsmith}
<D>__{hello, i'm angelo badmsith. come watch me read about the exciting events that took place during the industrial revolution.}
<C>__{angelo badsmith }
<D>__{also, i will tell you all about my personal misfortunes, such as my wife who cheated on me with a man named perry.}
<A>__{the screen reads: "the industrial revolution. summer `07." back on mark: his eyes are wide. the wheels in his head are spinning again.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{rob marlowe, your streak of success has finally come to an end.}
<A>__{suddenly mark jumps and runs to his kitchen table. he grabs a pen, pulls out a sheet of paper... and begins writing. series of jump cuts: mark writing furiously throughout the night, piling up page upon page. by the time the sun comes up mark is exhausted, with barely the energy to keep his head up as he writes "the end" and places the final page on his large stack of finished pages.}
