<L>__{exterior fog bank same time}
<A>__{the crippled boat chugs through the mist.}
<B>__{jimmy}
<A>__{swears again. bangs his fist.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{we're sitting ducks. they got sonar. they can find us.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{kill the running lights and radio the coast guard.}
<A>__{jimmy flicks off the lights. grabs the mike. as he does, a vibrating rumble fills the cockpit, causing him to pause... and then stare in shock as their boat emerges from the fog and air one hovers directly overhead.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{fuck me.}
<A>__{the two men watch, helpless, as the helicopter descends, the co pilot taking aim with a laws rocket.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{get down!}
<A>__{they both hit the floor. hands over their heads and then the pilot makes a costly error: he descends right into the path of milo's yacht. with no warning whatsoever, the boat comes bursting out of the fog plows right into the helicopter. second number one: the boat pierces the chopper, rips it to shreds. second number two: the whole boat slash chopper mix erupts in a shower of wood and fiberglass. turns night into day.}
<B>__{jimmy and joe}
<A>__{are still huddled on the floor. pause. they look up. bewildered. there was a big light... big noise... why aren't they dead?}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{they move like sleepwalkers to the cockpit window. stare in disbelief. joe looks at jimmy. jimmy at joe. debris rains down.}
