<L>__{ext night: radio city phone booth (winter 1945)}
<A>__{radio city music hall during the christmas show. kay and michael exit; tears are still streaming down her cheeks, and she sniffles, and dries her tears with kleenex. kay nostalgically hums "the bells of saint mary's," as they walk arm in arm.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{would you like me better if i were a nun?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{would you like me better if i were ingrid bergman?}
<A>__{they have passed a little enclosed newsstand. kay sees something that terrifies her. she doesn't know what to do. michael still walks, thinking about her question.}
<C>__{kay}
<P>__{(a little voice)}
<D>__{michael?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i'm thinking about it.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{michael...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no, i would not like you better if you were ingrid bergman.}
<A>__{she cannot answer him. rather she pulls him by the arm, back to the newsstand, and points. his face goes grave. the headlines read: "vito corleone shot, chieftan gunned down." michael is petrified; quickly he takes each edition, drops a dollar in the tray, and hungrily reads through them. kay knows to remain silent.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(desperately)}
<D>__{they don't say if he's dead or alive.}
