<L>__{exterior woods that moment}
<A>__{pov of our guy running blindly through the woods, flashlight beam throwing weird bouncing shadows across the trees, boots crunching in the snow, sound of his gasping breaths... he stops, wracked with pain, and doubles over with hands on knees to catch his breath. in the silence he hears her scream coming from ahead. he stands, and though still winded, starts running again.}
<L>__{exterior stranded oldsmobile roadside night}
<A>__{our guy emerges from the woods still carrying the newspapers he found in time to find our girl white with shock and screaming. he grabs her by the shoulders, shakes her.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{it's okay! you're okay! it's okay!}
<A>__{her screams give way to hyperventilating sobs.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{where were you?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i was looking for those guys. i didn't see anyone }
<P>__{(hesitating at the memory)}
<D>__{ there's nobody up there. what's wrong, what's wrong? did you see someone?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i...there was another guy...}
<A>__{she starts to tell him, then stops, not sure if she believes it herself. suddenly he looks down, notices her blackened mitten on her right hand. the palm is blistered and raw. he takes her hand gingerly, examines it. she winces in pain.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{what happened to you!? this looks like... oh jesus... like frostbite!}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i tried to... touch him...it burns.}
<A>__{he raises his eyes from her frostbite, looks at the dark silent stand of dense woods surrounding them. they exchange a look of knowing concern.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{let's get back in the car...}
<A>__{they start back in the direction of the stranded oldsmobile. pan down to the road, where something moves weakly under the fresh powdering of snow. the river eel, in its death throes.}
