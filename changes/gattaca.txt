<ACTION>__{A white title appears on a black screen. "As night-fall does not come at once, neither does oppression...It is in such twilight that we all must be aware of change in the air - however slight - lest we become victims of the darkness."}
<DIAL>__{Justice William O. Douglas}
<ACTION>__{The title fades off, replaced by a second title. "I not only think that we will tamper with Mother Nature, I think Mother wants us to."}
<DIAL>__{William Gaylin}
<ACTION>__{The second title fades off, leaving a dark screen. The darkness gradually gives way to a dawning light. We are confronted with sight of a barren, empty landscape.  A wide expanse of wasteland. Suddenly, without warning, an elephant tusk falls from the sky and crashes onto the parched ground.  The earth-shuddering impact causes the tusk to rebound once in slow motion before finally settling to the desert floor in a cloud of dust. The first tusk is quickly followed by a second, also dropping from the heavens.  It lands near the first.  Another tusk smashes to earth several yards away.  Yet another comes crashing into the foreground. Finally the dust settles upon a graveyard of tusks.}
<TRANS>__{DISSOLVE TO:}
<ACTION>__{A BARREN, EMPTY LANDSCAPE In another region of the wasteland, a forest of tree trunks suddenly rains down from the sky.  The trunks thump to the hard ground, also rebounding in slow motion.  Cleanly sawn, branchless, palm-like trunks, they come to rest in the dust only to be followed by a second cascade of lumber. When the dust finally clears. the felled tree trunks lie in a huge, log-jam in the desert.}
<TRANS>__{DISSOLVE TO:}
<ACTION>__{A BARREN, EMPTY LANDSCAPE Next to descend from the sky, a torrent of firewood.  One shower after another, crashing to the plain.  Enough chopped lumber to fuel a thousand hearths.}
<TRANS>__{DISSOLVE TO:}
<ACTION>__{A BARREN, EMPTY LANDSCAPE Joining the rest of the debris is a deluge of slate - sheets of shale from a great unseen quarry in the sky come slamming to earth.  Some of the pieces shattering, some rebounding into the air until the granite litters acres of landscape as far as the eye can see.}

<ACTION>__{SEQUENCE.  THE FINAL TITLE READS: T H E   N O T  -  T O O  -  D I S T A N T   F U T U R E The camera commences a long, slow pull-back from the pile of elephant tusks.  Gradually they are revealed as human fingernails magnified many hundreds of times. The tree trunks are mere hair follicles.  The firewood, whiskers.  The slate, flakes of skin.}
<LOC>__{INT.  INCINERATOR.  EARLY MORNING.}
<ACTION>__{A naked MAN, thirties, seen in profile, is crouched upon a metal floor inside a small, brushed stainless steel tank, rubbing his skin raw with a wire brush.  JEROME MORROW. Having completed his scrupulous ablutions, Jerome arches his lean frame through the small, oval door of the metal room with practised ease. Securing the thick, fireproof windowed door behind himself, he turns a switch to release gas into the vacated chamber.  The gas instantly ignites in what is now revealed to be a gleaming modern stainless-steel custom-made incinerator. We refocus on a MAGNIFIED CLOSE UP of his exfoliated flesh in the incinerator as it blackens, curls and burns. Jerone covers himself with a silk robe and steps into a pair of backless slippers.}
<LOC>__{INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  EARLY MORNING.}
<ACTION>__{JEROME emerges from the incinerator room into a large, luxurious loft-style condo containing a bizarre assortment of equipment - arranged somewhat like a production line. Long, scrupulously clean metal work benches are arranged along one entire wall.  Laid out on the benches in neat rows are dozens of plastic bags - some filled, some unfilled.  Instruments on trays - various types of tweezers, scissors and other less familiar utensils.  Round, stainless steel containers filled with hairs of differing lengths and other body matter. JEROME approaches another man slumped over one of the benches. EUGENE.  He clutches an empty vodka bottle.  He is snoring lightly - sleeping off the night before.  As JEROME gently prises the bottle out of his hand, we are struck by the similarity of Eugene's face to Jerome's. Jerome pulls Eugene's chair back from the desk with surprising ease.  A wheelchair - a modern, ergonomic design.  Jerome wheels Eugene to a bedroom and, with some difficulty, hauls the larger man onto the bed.  Through his alcoholic fog, Eugene feebly co- operates - his paralyzed legs a particular dead weight. After covering Eugene with a blanket, Jerome enters a bathroom containing a surgically-clean stainless steel basin, sink, shower and toilet. Beside the toilet stands a large, industrial-style stainless steel refrigerator. Donning protective gloves, Jerome opens the liquid-nitrogen cooled refrigerator.  A cloud of condensed water vapor billows out.  Revealed inside the fridge are racks of labelled jars and silicon pouches - some containing a yellowish liquid, some a deep, red liquid. In front of one of the jars is a handwritten shopping list - "TRUFFLES, CIGS, VODKA" .  Jerome smiles to himself as he retrieves the note along with one of the jars.  He checks the jar's label.  Satisfied with the date written there, he breaks the seal and pours the contents into the clear, silicon pouch of an IV-like device lying on the steel bathroom counter. He seals the pouch and checks the apparatus by opening the valve on its fine tube and squirting a small quantity of the liquid into the nearby toilet bowl, as one would test a syringe.  We remain on Jerome's face as he reaches between his legs and inserts the pouch. Reopening the refrigerator, Jerome slides out a tray containing neat rows of slim, fingertip-sized plastic sachets filled with a deep, red-colored liquid.  He removes his gloves, selects one of the sachets and carefully adheres the sachet to the pad at the end of his index finger.  He prepares a second sachet for his middle finger.  Jerome then applies skin-colored cover-up makeup to the sachets, blending them in with the color of his fingers. JEROME, still dressed in his robe, climbs a large, spiral staircase to the floor above.}
<LOC>__{INT.  JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM.  EARLY MORNING.}
<ACTION>__{He emerges at the top of the staircase into a similarly large, loft-stlye condominium.  Through the floor to ceiling window that opens onto a balcony we see that dawn is only just starting to leak into the night sky. In the bedroom JEROME removes a shirt from a drycleaning bag. Printed on the bag - "Confidentiality Guaranteed" .  He emerges from his bedroom, dressed in a smart albeit unconventionally cut suit.  He adjusts his tie in the mirror, careful not to disturb the sachets attached to his fingertips.}
<LOC>__{INT.  INVESTIGATOR'S POOL.  MORNING.}
<ACTION>__{A lone MAN swims a ferocious lap of freestyle in what appears to be a pool of enormous length - yet he never reaches the pool's end.  We pull wider to reveal that the man is swimming against an artificial current in a pool barely larger than himself. Abruptly, the man stops and stands up - the fast-flowing current instantly stilled.  We glimpse the face of INVESTIGATOR LUCAS. Thirties, he has a youthful yet rigid face.  We have the impression that he does not swim for pleasure.}
<LOC>__{EXT.  CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX.  MORNING.}
<ACTION>__{It is still early as JEROME exits the building's underground parking garage in an immaculate Studebaker Avanti and proceeds down the long straight driveway.  He exchanges a wave with a GARDENER trimming a lawn. The whir of the car's electric powered engine belies its conventional appearance.}
<LOC>__{EXT.  GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION.  DAY.}
<ACTION>__{JEROME's car exits a highway and turns up the sweeping road leading to the parking lot of "GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION". A sleek, modern, low-rise industrial compound boasting perfectly manicured landscaped gardens.}
<LOC>__{INT.  GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION.  DAY.}
<ACTION>__{JEROME strides purposefully up to the entranceway with hundreds of other GATTACA EMPLOYEES.  He carries himself with a certain arrogance, a cool detachment.  All employees wear similarly unconventionally-cut suits, short coiffed hair and robust tans. The Gattaca employees are a seemingly equal split of men and women and a diverse range of ethnicities. They filter through a row of channels supervised by SECURITY GUARDS.  Each channel contains a computerized security device, featuring a slim groove in which the employee places a finger under the watchful eye of a Security Guard. Jerome gives a polite nod to a Guard as he places his index finger in the groove.  His fingertip is jabbed with the finest of needles and a minute blood sample taken. The blood specimen confirms Jerome's identity - an ID photograph appearing on a computer screen. Out of the corner of his eye, Jerome spies a young woman entering through the adjacent channel.  She is also sneaking a glance in his direction - IRENE.  Catching each other looking, they both quickly avert their eyes. As Jerome enters the computer facility of Gattaca Aerospace Corporation he furtively glances at the pin-prick puncture in his fingertip sachet.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{SOMEWHERE IN DEEP SPACE.}
<ACTION>__{A GATTACA spacecraft skirts an asteroid.  Taking advantage of the rock's gravitational pull, the craft slingshots deeper into the black void.  Then abruptly the craft and the asteroid freeze in mid-space, suddenly reverse direction and proceed forward again - the spacecraft taking a slightly adjusted course. We pull back to reveal that the journey is merely a highly realistic graphic representation on a GATTACA computer screen operated by JEROME. Appearing simultaneously alongside the computer animation is a seemingly never-ending column of computer instructions for this celestial navigation - the incomprehensible language of the computer programmer.}

<ACTION>__{Jerome is transported - plotting a path through the heavens. As his fingers fly across the keys he does not once take his eyes from the screen. His is one of hundreds of ergonomically designed work stations, arranged in ever-widening circles in a huge, curcular, well- appointed if antiseptic room.  Each curved desk contains a computer terminal consisting of a keyboard and a slim, transparent screen behind which is seated a PROGRAMMER, designing software for the aerospace agency.  At the center of the room is a donut-shaped command console, chairs facing outwards, from which operations are monitored. Floor to ceiling smoked-glass curved walls offer the only concession to nature - a tinted view of a man-made, meticulously landscaped garden. Jerome tears himself away from his screen and picks up a discreet mini-vac.  He vacuums between the keys of his keyboard. DIRECTOR JOSEF, 50's, a shorter, official-looking man approaches.  His assistant IRENE stands at his shoulder.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(glancing to notification on Jerome's screen)}
<DIAL>__{You have a substance test.}
<ACTION>__{The Director briskly departs, Irene in tow.  At a nearby work station, a painfully thin programmer, NAPOLEON, perks up at the mention of the test. Jerome merely shrugs and pretends to reach down and scratch his ankle.  However he surreptitiously produced one of Eugene's transparent specimen bags from his sock.  An EXTREME CLOSE UP reveals the bag's contents - flakes of skin, hair follicles, eyelashes, a fingernail.  Cupping the bag in his hand to avoid detection, Jerome sprinkles the fraudulent body matter over his keyboard, desk surfaces and the floor around his work station. He opens his desk drawer and casually scatters the remainder of the bag.  Finally he inspects a comb already laced with two hair follicles. Jerome rises from his work station and makes his way towards the testing lab.}

<ACTION>__{White-coated LAMAR, forties, buzzcut, a man's man, checks JEROME's eyes with an instrument.  Satisfied with his examination, he passes a transparent plastic container to JEROME.  Standing directly in front of the technician with his back to camera, Jerome opens his fly.  A steady stream of urine begins to flow into the container from Jerome's hidden pouch.}

<LOC>__{INT.  GATTACA - RESTROOM.  DAY.}
<ACTION>__{JEROME enters the restroom and glances at the toilet stalls. Only three in the bank of twenty is occupied.  He tarries at the mirror above the uniform line of basins, unnecessarily reknotting his tie. A toilet flushes and a COLLEAGUE exits one of the stalls.  He and Jerome exchange a nod.  When the man has exited the restroom, Jerome enters the man's vacated stall.}
<LOC>__{INT.  GATTACA - TOILET STALL.  DAY.}
<ACTION>__{JEROME immediately feels around the back of the toilet bowl and detaches a secreted stainless steel container. With surprising swiftness and dexterity, Jerome removes an extremely fine contact lens from each eye and drops the pair into the toilet bowl.  He inserts two replacement lenses from the container and reattaches it in its hiding place. Jerome flushes the toilet and exits the stall.  He checks in the mirror that his new contact lenses are properly inserted.}
<LOC>__{INT.  GATTACA - CORRIDOR.  DAY.}
<ACTION>__{Walking back along one of the long, glass-walled corridors, JEROME becomes aware of a peculiar noise in the complex - or to be more precise, a lack of noise.  The incessant tapping of computer keys has stilled. As Jerome gazes through the glass walled corridor, we see the reflection of his face, deep in thought. JEROME (VO)}
<DIAL>__{The most unremarkable of events.  Jerome Morrow, Navigator First class, is only days away from a one-year manned mission to 951 Gaspra in the Outer Asteroid Belt.  Nothing so unique in that.  Last year over one thousand citizens from every walk of life embarked on some space mission or other.  Besides, selection for Jerome was virtually guaranteed at birth.  He is blessed with all the physical and intellectual gifts required for such an arduous undertaking, a genetic quotient second to none.}

Detectives begin to laboriously move along the line, taking finger-prick blood samples from each suspect - instantly confirming their identities with portable analyzers worn on their hips. As if having the idea at the same time, TWO SEPARATE MEN suddenly bolt from the line, knowing that their blood will incriminate them.  Other Detectives, watching for such escape attempts, esaily apprehend them and escort them to a waiting police van.
