<A>__{camera is on big nurse as she stands, in front of a chair, doing a deep breathing exercise. the patients and staff, standing in front of chairs arranged in a circle, follow suit as best they can. after a couple of exercises big nurse sits. the others do the same except bancini, who remains standing, wagging his head back and forth.}
<C>__{bancini}
<D>__{i'm tired. whew. o lord. oh, i'm awful tired...}
<C>__{big nurse}
<P>__{(busy with her papers)}
<D>__{somebody please see to mister bancini, so we can start the meeting.}
<A>__{billy does... gently laying a hand on bancini.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{t t t take it e e easy, p p p pete...}
<C>__{bancini}
<D>__{awful tired...}
<A>__{billy gently eases bancini into his chair and sits beside him, patting his skinny knee.}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{at the close of friday's meeting, we were discussing mister harding's problem, concerning his wife...}
<P>__{(reading from logbook)}
<D>__{mister harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. is that correct, mister harding?}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{yes, that's perfectly correct.}
<C>__{big nurse}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{he also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. he has been heard to say to his wife, 'i hate you, i don't ever want to see you again. you've betrayed me.'}
<P>__{(she closes book)}
<D>__{so. does anyone care to touch upon this further?}
<A>__{big nurse waits. a long beat. harding sits, chewing his nails, tensely waiting, almost wanting someone to begin. the patients shift uncomfortably, looking in all directions. mcmurphy looks around to see what will follow, when he sees ellis, nailed to the wall; his pants leg darkens and a puddle of piss forms at his feet. mcmurphy looks to see if big nurse or the aides have noticed. if they have, no one pays any attention. mcmurphy fidgets in his seat, then gets up, crosses to ellis, unhooks him from the wall, and moves him over a few feet. the other patients are aghast at this move, look at each other quizzically. big nurse merely watches. mcmurphy crosses back to his chair and sits.}
<C>__{big nurse }
<D>__{mister mcmurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. however, the cardinal rule, and i must emphasize this: everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{yes... we were discussing mister harding's problem with his wife. now, who will start?}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{billy.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{m m m ma'am?}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{would you like to start?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{n n n n n no, ma'am.}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{mister sefelt?}
<A>__{sefelt shrugs and sinks into his seat.}
<C>__{big nurse }
<D>__{mister fredrickson?}
<A>__{fredrickson passes.}
<C>__{big nurse }
<D>__{mister taber?}
<A>__{taber passes.}
<C>__{big nurse }
<D>__{mister martini?}
<C>__{martini}

<D>__{mister scanlon?}
<A>__{scanlon looks at the floor.}
<C>__{big nurse }
<D>__{mister cheswick?}
<A>__{cheswick wags his head 'no.'}
<C>__{big nurse }
<D>__{am i to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?}
<P>__{(no response; she focuses in on harding)}
<D>__{mister harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{yes, miss ratched, this is correct.}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{but you have no proof.}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{no, miss ratched...}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{and yet you suspect her.}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{yes, that is correct.}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{i can only speculate as to the reasons why.}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{have you ever speculated, mister harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?}
<A>__{one of the chronics laughs like a child.}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{miss ratched. given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that i held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that i can speculate on, at this late date, is how i will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.}
<C>__{sefelt}
<D>__{what's he talkin' about?}
<C>__{taber}
<D>__{yeah, harding, why don't you knockoff the bullshit and get to the pointerior}
<A>__{several acutes chime in, "yeah, get to the point," ad lib.}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{the point is, i will carry on until i fully understand what the function of that relationship is regardless of form or content.}
<A>__{several hands go up.}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{yes, billy?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i i i i i d d don't s s see how anyone could lu lu lu love a man who t t t talks the way he does.}
<C>__{taber}
<D>__{yeah, harding, you're so fuckin' dumb i can't believe it.}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{that's a matter of opinion.}
<C>__{sefelt}
<D>__{yeah, harding, where do you breathe anyway?}
<C>__{fredrickson}
<D>__{through the ass.}
<A>__{sefelt and fredrickson snicker into their hands. a few of the others laugh.}
<C>__{harding}
<P>__{(smarting)}
<D>__{is that your sense of humor or are you trying to say something?}
<C>__{fredrickson}
<P>__{(innocence itself)}
<D>__{now what would i be trying to say?}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{i don't know. i don't know, but it makes me feel very peculiar when you throw in something like that.}
<C>__{fredrickson}
<D>__{peculiar?}
<C>__{sefelt}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{taber}
<D>__{yeah, why?}
<C>__{scanlon}
<D>__{yeah, tell us why.}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{i hesitate to go on.}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{no secrets, mister harding. let's get it all out in the open...}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{i mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. i know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...}
<C>__{harding }
<P>__{(his voice rising as he goes on)}
<D>__{... or making me aware of a condition in my life, then i say, categorically speaking, the hell with you, taber! i don't have to justify the condition of my life to you or any of you. no matter what i will carry on until i fully understand what that function is regardless of the form or content. regardless of the fact we must try to understand the function of our capacity to obtain, to personify the condition, the condition of our existence, our existence...}
<C>__{taber}
<D>__{you know what, harding? i think you're some kind of morbid asshole or something. you've been talking about your wife evere since i can remember. you know, she's on your mind and blah, blah, blah and on and on and when are you going to wise up and turn her loose!}
<C>__{fredrickson}
<D>__{yeah, wise up, harding.}
<C>__{sefelt}
<D>__{yeah, turn her loose!}
<C>__{acutes}
<P>__{(start pouring it on)}
<D>__{yeah, who do you think you are anyway?... he thinks he's god almighty... he's a snob... he's a schmuck... dumbbell... creep... cretin... idiot... get rid of him... ship him upstairs...}

<D>__{i'm tired!}
<A>__{everyone hushes.}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{somebody see to mister bancini.}
<A>__{two or three acutes get up and try to soothe bancini, but he isn't to be hushed.}
<C>__{bancini}
<D>__{tired. tired. oh god, i'm tired...}
<A>__{big nurse nods to washington, who goes to pete, and gives his arm a jerk toward the door. bancini is unmovable. big nurse signals nurse pilbow, who heads for the nurses' station. washington senses danger, lets go of pete's arm, backs away.}
<C>__{washington}
<D>__{you a good boy, mistah bancini...}
<A>__{nurse pilbow returns, hypodermic needle in hand. pete turns to his fellow inmates.}
<C>__{bancini}
<D>__{you see... it's a lotta baloney... it's all a lotta baloney...}
<C>__{nurse pilbow}
<D>__{yes, yes, mister bancini, now if you'll just be calm...}
<C>__{bancini}
<D>__{that's all it is, just a lotta baloney. ya see, i can't help it, can't...}
<C>__{nurse pilbow}
<P>__{(working her way around bancini)}
<D>__{yes, i know, i know...}
<A>__{she gets him in the ass, with the needle, and springs back.}
<C>__{bancini}
<D>__{... don't ya see. i was born dead. not you. you wasn't born dead. ahhh, it's been so hard...}
<P>__{(starts going over,}
<D>__{slowly; sighing and}
<P>__{crying)}
<D>__{tired... i'm tired... aw ful tired...}
<A>__{mcmurphy looks around at the others. each patient is locked in his own world oblivious to bancini's state.}
