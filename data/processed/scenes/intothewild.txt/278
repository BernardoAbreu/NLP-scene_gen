<A>__{chris and rainey man the second hand goods booth while jan bathes sunni in a steel bucket by the van. among the goods, a used organ. chris is thrilled to have access to all the second hand books that are part of rainey and jan's inventory. as he skims through jack london's odyssey of the north, rainey notices tracy sitting on the steps of her vagabond parents' rig across from the booth. she picks silently at her guitar with her bright eyes fixed on chris.}
<C>__{rainey}
<D>__{how long can you stay with us?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{well, i'm waiting on a check from my last job to come into salton city the day after christmas. i've got to start thinking about getting ready for alaska. when the sun gets a little lower tonight, i'm going to start a calisthenics routine. i think after the check comes in, i will try to find some mountains i can climb everyday till spring comes. i gotta see how far the money's gonna go.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{i'm going to have to pick up a lot of supplies before spring. so, i might take another job or i might be okay.}
<C>__{rainey}
<D>__{well, you know, we'll give you a little something for every day you work the booth.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i'm not taking any money from you, rainey. it's been a real great twist meeting you two. you look like you're doing good.}
<C>__{rainey}
<D>__{we are, and you were a big part of that, coming along when you did. yep, things are good.}
<P>__{(gives a little giggle)}
<D>__{man, i used to think tantric sex was just a bunch of reading. speaking of which, don't you think you ought to introduce yourself to joni mitchell over there?}
<A>__{chris looks up from his book to the wide open 16 year old smile of tracy. rainey laughs aloud. chris smiles back, and against his better instincts, gives her a little wave over with the paperback. tracy jumps off her step, putting her guitar inside the rig, and trots like a little wood nymph to chris.}
