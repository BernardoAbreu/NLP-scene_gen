<P>__{(morose)}
<D>__{you want to know the real kicker? the real kicker is, for the first time in my life the first time i feel like a loser.}

<C>__{o'connor}
<P>__{(emphatically)}

<A>__{ted nods in agreement. there is a beat of silence as both men consider joanna's imminent return. then:}
<C>__{o'connor}
<P>__{(trying to be tactful)}
<D>__{but... just in case... i mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. what are you going to do about the kid?}

<P>__{(a friend having to}
<D>__{say something very}
<P>__{difficult)}
<D>__{look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay? but if you want my advice, you'll send billy away to stay with relatives for a while. just until you get yourself straightened out.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(doubtfully)}
<D>__{i don't know, jim...}
<C>__{o'connor}
<P>__{(the dutch uncle)}
<D>__{ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? and now it's up to us that's you and me to deliver the goods. ted, you're my main man, and if i can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{jim, i appreciate what you're saying. i mean it, but i really think joanna's coming back.}
