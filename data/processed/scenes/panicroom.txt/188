<L>__{interior panic room night}
<A>__{ and arrive inside the panic room, where burnham is this close to getting the safe open, when all of a sudden }
<B>__{whomp. crunch.}
<A>__{burnham and raoul freeze, alarmed. it's coming from the long wall, the shared wall. they look at each other.}
<B>__{whomp. crunch.}
<A>__{they look at the wall. somebody is on the other side, pounding like hell.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{the walls are steel, right?}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{not that one.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{not that one?!}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!}
<A>__{whomp! crunch! louder. closer. burnham turns, screams at the wall.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{who the fuck breaks in through the neighbor's house?!}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{we've got the kid!}
<P>__{(shouting at the wall)}
<D>__{we've got your kid!! what the fuck is she thinking?!}
<A>__{whomp! crunch!}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{she's got your gun, that's what she's thinking! the fuck you had to bring a gun for?!}
<A>__{burnham throws himself back on the floor, goes back to work on the safe. fires up the drill again, it screams into the metal.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{almost there...}
<A>__{the pounding keeps up from next door. we hear sheetrock torn away on the far side. bricks, scraping out of place. sarah, in the corner, is energized, excited. while burnham and raoul are distracted, she grabs the leather pouch, palms the three syringes that are left in there.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{almost there...}
<A>__{finally, the door to the safe crunches in on one side, yielding to the drilling at the very moment that the head of a sledgehammer crashes through the wall of the panic room. raoul grabs hold of sarah, burnham maintains his focus, throwing open the safe, revealing nothing. crunch! the sledgehammer head strikes again, opening up a hole about a foot across. light spills through from the other side, as well as the voice of the hysterical neighbor. raoul hurls sarah against the far wall, leaps over to the side of the hole, and waits, poised above it. at the safe, burnham doesn't lose his cool, just opens a false bottom in the safe, revealing a manila envelope. he snatches it up, rips it open, and his eyes dance as he holds up fourteen individual one million dollar u,s, treasury bearer bonds. he fans them out, eyes drinking from his grail. bang! a gunshot whizzes right through one of the bonds, setting it aflame before it slams into the far wall, sending up a little cloud of plaster dust.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{jesus!}
<A>__{he whirls, sees an arm poking through the hole in the wall, gun extended. but raoul is standing just above the hole, and already has his boot raised, over the hand. he brings it down, a crunching blow that stomps right on meg's wrist. meg screams, loses her grip on the gun, and it clatters into the space between the houses. between the walls, the gun falls into oblivion, the space between the walls, where no one can get to it. in the panic room, burnham shoves the loose bonds into his jacket.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{i got the money, let's go!!!}
<A>__{raoul grabs sarah and turns, jabs the green button to open the door. behind them, meg screams in anger and wriggles through the opening. before she's even all the way through, she gets hold of raoul's leg and pulls herself into the panic room, scraping and bloodying herself on the edges of the too small hole.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{go, let's go, outta here!!}
<A>__{but raoul is deep in a violent rage. still holding sarah with one hand, he bends down, grabs meg by the hair, and drags her toward the doorway.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{you know how this is gonna go!}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{fuck you, i'm gone!}
<A>__{he bolts out of the room, through the metal door, which is just finishing its slow crank open, its heavy spring coiling in the wall. raoul drag meg across the floor by the hair, right into the track of the open steel door. she looks up, sees the infrared safety beam over her head, and realizes with horror what his intention is. still with one arm holding sarah, who is kicking and struggling viciously, raoul holds meg's head down on the floor, below the safety beam that would prevent the door from closing. he reaches for the "close" button. sarah raises her arm, stuffed with three syringes, and jabs them into raoul's neck. raoul screams in pain. meg manages to raise her head, breaking the beam.}
