<A>__{theo walks into the house. the place is completely trashed. theo picks up a golf ball from the floor. he makes his way to the bathroom door and slowly turns the knob; then pulls back. he picks up a nearby bowling ball and holds it over his head as he reaches for the doorknob. this time, he thrusts the door open. the bathroom is empty. relieved, he cradles the ball in his arms.}
