<L>__{interior alex's restaurant night}
<A>__{it is late night in new york. a phone rings atop the bar of alex's restaurant with no one in sight.}
<L>__{interior piazza day}
<A>__{hawk pokes his head to see a darwin and minerva (holding bunny) emerge from the limousine. as he turns his con centration back to the phone, alex himself flows out from a building to cheerfully speak with darwin and minerva and get licked by bunny, before they all pile into the limo.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{a lex, a lex, come on alex.}
<A>__{hawk slams down the phone and turns to see the limousine pull off. hawk angrily bursts from the door and is painfully clotheslined by agent butterfinger, who is dressed as a mailman. crumpled on the ground, hawk kicks out with his foot, into butterfinger's stomach, doubling him. hawk then grabs him by the head and rams into the glass of the booth. hawk rotates off for an escape...but the rest of the cia crew cuts him off holding barely concealed guns; snickers dressed as a maitre 'd, almond joy as a bermuda tourist, and kaplan in his usual emsemble. kit kat is dressed exactly like hawk, right down to a bloody lip. hawk gives him a double take.}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{hawk, hawk, hawk. enjoying italy? i always had a soft spot for rome. did my first barehanded strangulation here. communist politician.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{why george, you big softie...}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{god, i miss communism. the red threat. people were scared, the agency was respected, and i got laid every night.}
<A>__{a humiliated butterfinger comes waddling out, holding the phone. kaplan rolls his eyes.}
<C>__{butterfinger}
<D>__{sorry, coach...}
<C>__{kaplan}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{if his father wasn't the head of shit, i hate this, the government's got me farmed out, working for the mayflower corporation now, money beats politics. war isn't hell anymore, it's dull. don't slaughter their men and rape their women, just steal their microchips.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{you know kaplan, if you weren't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived, i'd feel sorry for you.}
<C>__{snickers}
<D>__{good news, bud, the mayflowers have moved up the time table. you're hitting the vatican to night.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{tonight? you're whacked. the timing's off, i'm underequipped damnit, i have a date!}
<A>__{almond joy smoothly extracts hawk's notebook and reads...}
<C>__{almond joy}
<D>__{grapple, biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, pocket fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. gee stud, this is going to be some date. no harvey's bristol cream?}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{snickers, make the list happen. oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers. i've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{thanks for sharing.}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{we blow up space shuttles for breakfast. you and your friend alex would be a late afternoon triscuit.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{if you do anything to my friend...}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{yeah, right. by the way, as long as i'm getting things off my chest, i'm the one who killed your little monkey. made it look like a mafia hit. did it for fun. ciao.}
<A>__{kaplan and the crew quickly disperse in different directions as hawk howls in frustration. kit kat moves behind hawk and perfectly mimics him.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{what did you have against little eddie, motherfucker? he was just a monkey who liked to laugh. come back without your yuppie army. i will triscuit you, you space shuttle eating...shit.!}
<A>__{without looking, hawk elbows the mimic kit kat in the face. kit kat gives hawk a strange smile and hands him a card that reads: beware the odd steps. hawk looks up from the card. kit kat is gone, but butterfinger scampers in his place.}
<C>__{butterfinger}
<D>__{hey, mr. hawk, i got those 72 stamps!}
<A>__{sighing, hawk takes the huge sheath of stamps.}
