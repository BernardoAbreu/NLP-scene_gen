<L>__{exterior large expensive country house night}
<A>__{a rock is hurled onto the roof of the house. thump. it rolls down and off into the yard. flood lights shine up at a beautiful large country home. three people run through the yard, dashing through the light and back into the shadows. it is martha, watts, and zoe, hurls another rock onto the roof. a man inside comes to the window. zoe picks up a rock and throws it onto the roof. the man in the window walks towards his front door. watts leads martha towards the house. the man in the house comes out of his front door, walks around the side of his house and looks up to see what's hitting the roof. he leaves the front door open. watts and martha creep into the house.}
