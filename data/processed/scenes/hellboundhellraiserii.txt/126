<L>__{interior tiffany's room day}
<A>__{kirsty enters the room. it is as we last saw it except that the walls have re parted to give onto the corridors of hell. carefully and slowly, kirsty moves across to the entrance and looks down it. she is rewarded with the sight of tiffany just disappearing at the far end of the first corridor. with a grimace, kirsty follows her in.}
<L>__{interior corridor labyrinth}
<A>__{tiffany's skill at finding her way through puzzles means the girls are soon in the murkier corridors close to the centre. hell seems angrier now, steam is issuing in jets from the corridor walls, the cries of children are heard faintly on the soundtrack, leviathan's breathing is more dominant, perhaps the light is even pulsing in time with it. kirsty is still several yards behind tiffany. tiffany takes a corner and is out of sight for a second or so . kirsty dashes around the corner to find tiffany staring with distress at something on the floor. it is the skin ripped off julia by the vacuum tunnel earlier.}

<D>__{oh, gross.}
<A>__{tiffany bends down and retrieves the white diamond box from the empty fingers.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{what are you doing? what are we doing?}
<A>__{tiffany looks at the box in her hand. when she speaks, it is not to kirsty but to herself.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{i can't do it here. i have to go to it.}
