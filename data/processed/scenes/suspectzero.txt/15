<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior rest stop off the interstate day}
<A>__{your standard roadside rest stop: a parking lot with weeds poking through it and bathrooms you wouldn't go near. those stormclouds we saw earlier are closer now... police cars and highway patrol motorcycles fill this site. charlton's fbi sedan pulls up. he and mackelway get out. two men approach: sheriff harry dylan, 50; and his deputy, bud granger, a gangly, baby faced pup.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{afternoon, rick.}
<P>__{(charlton nods)}
<D>__{looks like a robbery homicide. body's over that way.}
<A>__{he gestures toward a ravine, where a tow truck is currently lowering a winch toward an abandoned vehicle. it is harold speck's buick, nose down in the ravine, teetering on a rock, like the balanced scales of justice.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{ya run the plates?}
<A>__{charlton eyes mackelway: "easy, hot shot." mackelway nods, reminding himself to remember his new rank. dylan hands a preliminary report to charlton.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{fella's name is harold speck. traveling salesman, from abilene.}
<A>__{charlton eyes the report, then hands it to mackelway. the hierarchy is being made clear. very. mackelway turns: this ravine runs right up against a sign that reads "welcome to texas" on one side and "you are now leaving oklahoma" on the other. a vehicle, left right on the state line. odd... then, a noise: that tow truck winch, grinding badly. it's just about to yank the buick out of this ditch.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<P>__{(it blurts out)}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{before charlton can react, mackelway is running across this weed choked lot, zeroing in on the tow truck driver.}
