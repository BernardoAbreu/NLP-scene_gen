<A>__{a beaten denise struggles down a long tunnel. she gets to the end to find that it is a dead end. behind her, five ghouls move silently towards her, blocking her only exit. the ghouls slosh through the muck, moving in closer. denise frantically looks for an escape, nailed into the wall next to her are planks of wood forming a ladder. the ghouls are only a few yards away. denise climbs up the ladder. they move in, clawing at her legs and feet, trying to pull her down. denise digs at the wood and mud ceiling above her, trying to break free. denise is bleeding severely from the chunks of flesh being torn from her legs. she digs wildly at the ceiling, suddenly a board falls free and mud rains down to reveal: stars, the sky above shines through the hole. denise smashes her fists at the rotted wood planks, pulling free another piece. with all her might denise grabs hold and pulls herself up through the opening.}
