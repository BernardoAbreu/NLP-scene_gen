<A>__{they said }
<C>__{stanton }
<D>__{send another damn cable!}
<A>__{stanton thrusts the cable at beckwith, who taps it out immediately. stanton turns to a table where the large map of wilmington from the cabinet meeting is laid out, heavily scribbled on. gustavus fox, assistant secretary of the navy, and charles benjamin, stanton's clerk, are checking the marks on the map against a stack of dispatches.}
<C>__{stanton }
<D>__{the problem's their commander, whiting. he engineered the fortress himself. the damned thing's his child; he'll defend it till his every last man is gone. he is not thinking rationally, he's }

<D>__{that's what ethan allen called to the commander of fort ticonderoga in 1776. "come on out, you old rat!" `course there were only forty odd redcoats at ticonderoga. but, but there is one ethan allen story that i'm very partial to }

<D>__{no! no, you're, you're going to tell a story! i don't believe that i can bear to listen to another one of your stories right now!}

<C>__{stanton }
<D>__{i need the b&o sideyard schedules for alexandria! i asked for them this morning!}
<A>__{lincoln pays no attention to stanton's fulminations and continues with his story.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{it was right after the revolution, right after peace had been concluded, and ethan allen went to london to help our new country conduct its business with the king. the english sneered at how rough we are, and rude and simple minded and on like that, everywhere he went, till one day he was invited to the townhouse of a great english lord. dinner was served, beverages imbibed, time passed, as happens, and mr. allen found he needed the privy. he was grateful to be directed thence relieved you might say.}
<A>__{everyone laughs.}
<C>__{lincoln }
<D>__{now, mr. allen discovered on entering the water closet that the only decoration therein was a portrait of george washington. ethan allen done what he came to do and returned to the drawing room. his host and the others were disappointed when he didn't mention washington's portrait. and finally his lordship couldn't resist, and asked mr. allen had he noticed it, the picture of washington. he had. well, what did he think of its placement, did it seem appropriately located to mr. allen? mr. allen said it did. his host was astounded! appropriate? george washington's likeness in a water closet? yes, said mr. allen, where it'll do good service: the whole world knows nothing'll make an englishman shit quicker than the sight of george washington.}

<D>__{i love that story.}
<A>__{beckwith's and bates's keys starts clicking. they transcribe furiously. there's a general rush to the operators' desks. lincoln walks quickly over, and is joined there by stanton, who arrives just as the first dispatch has been completed and is being decoded. stanton and lincoln hold hands, as they've done many times, waiting for news of the battle. bates hands the decoded cable to benjamin, who reads it quickly, then announces to the room:}
