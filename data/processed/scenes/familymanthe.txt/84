<L>__{interior bowling alley evening}
<A>__{a crowded suburban new jersey bowling alley... jack stands at a lane holding a bowling ball, the nickname the hammer emblazoned over his bowling shirt pocket...he approaches the line and throws the ball down the lane... its ugly...the ball caroms off the hardwood into the gutter.}

<A>__{jack puts everything he has into the throw, heaving the ball down the lane with as much grace and power as he can muster...hitting the six pin and taking out four others.}
