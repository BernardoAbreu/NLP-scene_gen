<D>__{yeah man, have a good one.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{come on, seth. let's go.}
<A>__{jules pulls seth away. evan and helen start walking in the opposite direction. as they walk away from one another, seth and evan look back and give each other a small and yet emotionally charged wave. a slow, gut wrenching soul song starts to play. they look as though they're never going to see each other again.}
