<A>__{a beaten down mike sits alongside ed at the bar.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{it was terrible. the place is evil, ed. that building needs to be exorcised.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{come on. it couldn't have been that bad.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{my beanbag was lit on fire, videoed and sent to every member of student body.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{yeah, i caught it on youtube. funny stuff.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{they mocked my clothes and phone. my daughter got a tongue bath in front of me and i have mint chip in my ears.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{high school's great, isn't it?}
<A>__{the bartender approaches.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{what can i get you?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{double scotch neat.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{funny, kid.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{get the boy a shirley temple. extra cherries.}
<A>__{the bartender nods serves up the drinks. mike miserably plucks a cherry off his pink drink.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i'm not going back there.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{mike, you're an adult sitting on 36 years of experience. you should be dominating these kids, ripping their hearts out.}
<A>__{an older woman takes a seat next to the boys.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i know why you're encouraging me all of a sudden.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{because i'm a supportive dad.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{because you want to nail my principal.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{did she ask about me?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{she's not your type. she's smart.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{as far as i can tell that's her only flaw. i need a reason to see her again. you could flunk your classes, start a fight, vandalize the place. you'll figure it out. then i can rush in, a teary eyed, helpless, single dad who can't handle his angry, kitten killing son. what do you think?}
<A>__{the older lady, having listened to it all, turns to ed }
<C>__{older lady}
<D>__{i think you should be reported to child services!}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{mind your business, lady. this is a family matter.}
<A>__{the lady turns away in disgust.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i can't do it. i don't have it in me.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{hey, no sweat off my sack. tell alex to stop wearing underwear all together. he'll be fine. that's what i did.}
<A>__{mike eyes ed, considers just how "well adjusted" ed is. a determined look comes over mike. he pounds the bar.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you're right! my kids need me.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{at'a boy. now what you need is a crash course on being a teen in...}
