<D>__{good morning. my name is christine collins. on march 10th, my nine year old son, walter collins, disappeared. a four month investigation resulted in a boy being brought to los angeles from de kalb, illinois. they told me, and all of you, that this boy was my son. they were wrong.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the los angeles police department made a mistake...a terrible mistake. the boy they found is not my son. that is the reason for the supposed "transformation." i have letters from his dentist, his teachers and others confirming that this boy is not my son. the letters are being reprinted now, and i should have them for you tomorrow.}
<A>__{flashbulbs pop, dazzling her. she composes herself.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{i have given the police department every opportunity to admit their mistake and renew the search for my son. since they have refused to do so, i have no choice but to present my case before the public. i hope this will persuade the police to finish the job they started, and bring my son home to me.}

<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{changeling a true story as the reporters start to shout out questions, we pan across to a beat cop who has been watching. he goes quickly to a police call box, unlocks it and picks up the telephone.}
