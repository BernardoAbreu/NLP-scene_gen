<A>__{the flap is thrust aside and scar steps out the same comanche we had seen at the grave when debbie was captured. he stands tall, arrogant, eyeing the white men with hard, implacable eyes. he has a robe gathered about him. across his face is a scar.}

<D>__{senores! this is cicatriz!}
<L>__{exterior indian encampment close shot ethan and martin day}

<P>__{(slowly... at last)}
<D>__{scar... it's plain to see where you got your name.}

<C>__{scar}
<D>__{your name big shoulders... his name he who follows.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{you speak pretty good american for a comanche... someone teach you?}
<A>__{it is a leading question and scar knows it. he looks long at ethan and the suggestion of a smile touches his lips. but he makes no direct answer. he looks instead to emilio.}
