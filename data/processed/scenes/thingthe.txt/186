<A>__{through the fogged up windows, a figure can be seen approaching the main compound. it pulls and drags its way along the guide rope, fighting the gale force winds.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{the men}
<A>__{weapons in hand, huddle at the main doorway. they unbolt it. sleet and hail send nauls rolling in from the outside. the men force the door back and lock it. the weary nauls kneels on the floor and gasps for air. the others surround him.}
<C>__{palmer}
<D>__{where's macready?}
<A>__{nauls weighs each of them ominously, while digging down underneath his heavy jacket.}
<C>__{nauls}
<D>__{cut him loose of the line up by his shack.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{cut him loose?}
<C>__{nauls}
<D>__{when we were up poking around his place... i found this...}
<A>__{he pulls out a thick bundle of heavy clothing. it is mutilated and partially burned. he holds out the jacket to show the inside collar. close on name tag it reads: r.j. macready the men, as they examine in a hush.}
<C>__{nauls}
<D>__{...it was stashed in his old coal furnace... wind must have dislodged it... i don't think he saw me find it.}
<A>__{the men continue to examine in various states of disbelief.}
<C>__{nauls}
<D>__{...made sure i got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.}

<A>__{childs and norris separate them.}
<C>__{norris}

<A>__{a pounding at the door sends the men jerking backward. nauls scampers to his feet. they tense.}
<C>__{macready }
<D>__{open up!}
<A>__{no answer as the men surround the door, their weapons ready. fear.}
<C>__{macready }
<D>__{...hey, somebody! open up, it's me, macready...}
<P>__{(still nothing)}

<A>__{the men keep their voices low.}

<D>__{let's open it.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{hell no.}
<A>__{more pounding.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<P>__{(shaking)}
<D>__{you think he's changed into one of those things?}
<C>__{norris}
<D>__{he hasn't had enough time.}
<C>__{childs}

<C>__{palmer}
<P>__{(slightly trembling)}
<D>__{he's so close. maybe our best chance to blow him away.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{no. just let him freeze out there.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<P>__{(voice cracking)}
<D>__{what if we're wrong about him?}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{then we're wrong.}
