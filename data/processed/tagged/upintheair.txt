<D>__{my parents had taught me we lived in the best place on earth, but now i could see the world was really just one place and comparing didn't make much sense. and i remember thinking don't tell me this isn't an age of miracles. don't tell me we can't be everywhere at once.}
<A>__{the idea settles in. ryan returns to the pointerior}
