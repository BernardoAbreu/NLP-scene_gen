<L>__{interior "el ranco" cabaret night }
<A>__{medium shot of the same woman as before, finishing the drink she started to take above. it is susie. the music, of course, is now very loud. thompson, his back to the camera, moves into the picture in the close foreground. a captain appears behind susie, speaking across her to thompson.}
<C>__{the captain}
<P>__{(a greek)}
<D>__{this is mr. thompson, miss alexander.}
<A>__{susan looks up into thompson's face. she is fifty, trying to look much younger, cheaply blonded, in a cheap, enormously generous evening dress. blinking up into thompson's face, she throws a crink into ther mouth. her eyes, which she thinks is keeping commandingly on his, are bleared and watery.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(to the captain)}
<D>__{i want another drink, john.}
<A>__{low thunder from outside.}
<C>__{the captain}
<P>__{(seeing his chance)}
<D>__{right away. will you have something, mr. thompson?}
<C>__{thompson}
<P>__{(staring to sit down)}
<D>__{i will have a highball.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(so insistently as}
<D>__{to make thompson change his mind}
<P>__{and stand up again)}
<D>__{who told you you could sit down here?}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{oh! i thought maybe we could have a drink together?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{think again!}
<A>__{there is an awkward pause as thompson looks from her to the captain.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{why don't you people let me alone? i'm minding my own business. you mind yours.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{if you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, miss alexander. all i want to ask you...}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{get out of here!}
<P>__{(almost hysterical)}
<D>__{get out! get out!}
<A>__{thompson looks at the captain, who shrugs his shoulders.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{i'm sorry. maybe some other time }
<A>__{if he thought he would get a response from susan, who thinks she is looking at him steelily, he realizes his error. he nods and walks off, following the captain out the door.}
<C>__{the captain}
<D>__{she's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, mr. thompson.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{i'm not from a newspaper exactly, i }
<A>__{they have come upon a waiter standing in front of a booth.}
<C>__{the captain}
<P>__{(to the waiter)}
<D>__{get her another highball.}
<C>__{the waiter}
<D>__{another double?}
<C>__{the captain}
<P>__{(after a moment, pityingly)}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{they walk to the door.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{she's plastered, isn't she?}
<C>__{the captain}
<D>__{she'll snap out of it. why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about mr. kane as about anybody. sooner.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{i will come down in a week or so and see her again. say, you might be able to help me. when she used to talk about kane did she ever happen to say anything about rosebud?}
<C>__{the captain}
<D>__{rosebud?}
<A>__{thompson has just handed him a bill. the captain pockets it.}
<C>__{the captain}
<D>__{thank you, sir. as a matter of fact, yesterday afternoon, when it was in all the papers i asked her. she never heard of rosebud.}
