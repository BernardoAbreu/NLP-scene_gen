<L>__{136b tight on terminator's left forearm as the knife makes a deep cut just}
<A>__{below the elbow. in one smooth motion, terminator cuts all the way around his arm. with a second cut, he splits the skin of the forearm from elbow to wrist. terminator grasps the skin and strips is off his forearm like a surgeon rips off a rubber glove. it comes off with a sucking rip, leaving a bloody skeleton. but the skeleton is made of bright metal, and is laced with hydraulic actuators. the fingers are as finely crafted as watch parts... they flex into a fist and extend. terminator holds it up, palm out, in almost the exact position of the one in the vault at cyberdyne, hold on dyson reacting to the servo hand in front of him. he's seen one of these before. tarissa is screaming now, but he doesn't hear her.}
