<D>__{i was instructed to take a lodging for the night in a coffee house near gray's inn, and anxiously expected a visit from mr. tapewell.}
<A>__{tapewell talking to roderick.}
<C>__{tapewell}
<D>__{i have been authorized by lady cosgrove and her advisors to pay you an annuity of 300 pounds a year, specifically on the condition of you remaining abroad out of the three kingdoms, and to be stopped on the instant of your return. i advise you to accept it without delay for you know, as well as i do, that your stay in london will infallibly plunge you in gaol, as there are innumerable writs taken out against you here and in the west of england, and that your credit is so blown upon that you could not hope to raise a shilling. i will leave you the night to consider this proposal, but if you refuse, the family will proceed against you in london, and have you arrested. if you accede, a quarter salary will be paid to you at any foreign port you should prefer.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{mr. tapewell, i do not require a night to consider this proposal. what other choice has a poor, lonely and broken hearted man? i shall take the annuity, and leave the country.}
<C>__{mr. tapewell}
<D>__{i am very glad to hear that you have come to this decision, mr. cosgrove. i think you are very wise.}
<A>__{there is a knock at the door and roderick opens it. brookside enters with four constables armed with pistols. the dialogue for this scene has to be written. brookside has gone against the bargain, and has decided to have roderick arrested upon one of the many writs out against him for debt. mr. tapewell is surprised and complains weakly that brookside is acting in bad faith. brookside brushes aside his objections. roderick is defeated, and meekly sits down in a chair. the following lines are read over roderick being shackled and led out of the room.}

<D>__{mr. james cosgrove's personal narrative finishes here, for the hand of death interrupted the ingenious author soon after the period which this memoir was compiled, after he had lived nineteen years an inmate of the fleet prison, where the prison records state he died of delirium tremens.}
