<L>__{exterior rue de la chanvrerie night}
<A>__{marius comes down the street, his mind full of thoughts of cosette.}
<L>__{interior cafe musain night}
<A>__{marius arrives at the first floor front room. here a group of students are cleaning rifles and sharing their excitement at the coming revolution: enjolras, combeferre, courfeyrac, joly, grantaire, feuilly, prouvaire and others.}
<C>__{enjolras}
<D>__{well, courfeyrac! do we have all the guns? joly, prouvaire! our time is running short!}
<C>__{courfeyrac}
<D>__{students, workers, everyone! there's a river on the run! like the flowing of the tide, paris is coming to our side!}
<C>__{combeferre}
<D>__{enjolras! at notre dame the sections are prepared!}
<C>__{feuilly}
<D>__{at rue du bac they're straining at the leash!}
<C>__{enjolras}
<D>__{grantaire, put the bottle down! did we get the guns we need?}
<C>__{grantaire}
<D>__{give me brandy on my breath and i will breathe them all to death!}
<C>__{enjolras}
<D>__{the time is near... so near it's stirring the blood in their veins. and yet beware! don't let the wine go to your brains. for the army we fight is a dangerous foe with the men and the arms that we never can match. it is easy to sit here and swat them like flies but the national guard will be harder to catch. we need a sign to rally the people to call them to arms to bring them in line!}
<A>__{joly turns goes over to marius at the back, a faraway look on his face.}
<C>__{joly}
<D>__{marius, wake up! what's wrong today? you look as if you've seen a ghost.}
<C>__{grantaire}
<D>__{some wine, and say what's going on!}
<A>__{they sit.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{a ghost, you say? a ghost maybe! she was like a ghost to me one minute there then she was gone!}
<C>__{grantaire}
<D>__{i am agog! i am aghast! is marius in love at last? i've never heard him ooh and aah. you talk of battles to be won}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{grantaire }
<D>__{and here he comes like don juan! it is better than an opera!}
<A>__{they burst into laughter. but enjolras isn't smiling.}
<C>__{enjolras}
<D>__{it is time for us all to decide who we are. do we fight for the right to a night at the opera now? have you asked yourselves what's the price you might pay? is this simply a game for rich young boys to play? the colours of the world are changing day by day red the blood of angry men! black the dark of ages past! red a world about to dawn! black the night that ends at last!}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{had you seen her today you might know how it feels to be struck to the bone by a moment of breathless delight! had you been there today you might also have known how the world may be changed in just one burst of light and what was right seems wrong and what was wrong seems right!}
<C>__{grantaire}
<D>__{red!}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{i feel my soul on fire!}
<C>__{grantaire}
<D>__{black!}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{my world if she's not there!}
<C>__{students}
<D>__{red!}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{the colour of desire!}
<C>__{students}
<D>__{black!}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{the colour of despair!}
<C>__{enjolras}
<D>__{marius, you're no longer a child i do not doubt you mean it well but now there is a higher call! who cares about your lonely soul? we strive towards a larger goal our little lives don't count at all!}
<C>__{enjolras}
<D>__{red!}
<C>__{students}
<D>__{the blood of angry men!}
<C>__{enjolras}

<A>__{a scuffle at the door gavroche struggling with the barman. courfeyrac lets him through.}
<C>__{gavroche}
<D>__{listen! listen to me!}
<C>__{courfeyrac}
<D>__{listen, everybody!}
<C>__{gavroche}
<D>__{general lamarque is dead!}
<A>__{enjolras turns to his companions.}
<C>__{enjolras}
<D>__{lamarque is dead... lamarque... his death is the hour of fate. the people's man... his death is the sign we await! on his funeral day they will honour his name with the light of rebellion ablaze in their eyes. from their candles of grief we will kindle our flame. on the tomb of lamarque shall our barricades rise! the time is here!}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{enjolras }
<D>__{let us welcome it gladly with courage and cheer!}
<C>__{student}
<D>__{let us take to the street with no doubt in our hearts}
<C>__{courfeyrac}
<D>__{but a jubilant shout!}
<C>__{lesgles}
<D>__{they will come one and all!}
<C>__{students}
<D>__{they will come when we call!}
<A>__{as the students sing, eponine enters wanting to talk to marius. marius sees her.}
