<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior lenny's apartment}
<A>__{squid pov: the killer enters the vacant hotel room, passing the mirror on the dresser.}
<C>__{lenny }
<D>__{come on... look in the mirror. you know it's there, you're keeping your eyes off it, you bastard... shit! who are you?}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{lenny, yanking the wire off his head, mace near him.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{he knows what he's doing. he's worn before... a lot.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{so that gives you something.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{it gives me... i don't know... maybe two hundred people who i know wear.}
<A>__{as he talks lenny fiddles with some custom electronics gear. the back is off the deck, and he has a ribbon wire connecting it to some kind of amplifier black box which he is using to boost the gain.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{don't crank the gain any more. you're gonna fry yourself.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i need to see more... get more detail. something. i feel his presence, so strong...}
<A>__{mace watches, concerned, as lenny puts the trodes back on and hits playback. squid povs: strobe like images of iris' rape and death, separated by burst of static... ... as lenny keeps hitting the forward and rewind buttons, searching the tape for clues, reacting to the feelings on the tape, trying to manage his revulsion... ... until mace yanks the trodes off and lenny sags back on the couch. he rubs his eyes. he is seeing ghosts, afterimages burned into his visual cortex. the room is alive with them, shimmering.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{no more, lenny.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{yeah. i'm ghosting pretty bad.}
<A>__{lenny see iris' terrified face. literally. it floats iridescent on his living room wall, fading slowly.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{she came to me for help. i should have read it better... i just figured, y'know... another strung out hooker having a bad night.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{it's not your fault.}
<A>__{lenny gets up, staggering to the kitchen. she goes with him.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{sex killers act alone. so there's no information on the street, which is how cases get made. cops know they'll never nail this guy the second they look at the scene.}
<A>__{lenny sucks down four tylenol with a long pull from a bottle of vodka.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{and anyway, nobody gives a shit about a dead hooker. they're roadkill.}
<A>__{requiem for iris. mace watches lenny rubbing his eyes, waiting for the tylenols to hit.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{see, it's all about what they see walking in. a dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong. random kill. the kind you never solve.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{but that doesn't add, does it.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{no it doesn't.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{because iris knew somebody was after her.}
<A>__{lenny, wound up like a swiss movement, starts pacing.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{she said "if they get me". they. which means the whole sex killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{so the guy's not a sicko.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{if he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. the point is, he was a hitter. somebody wanted to shut her up. but why not just put a little lead in her ear?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{because it had to look random. not connected to anything or anyone.}
<P>__{(he seems to run out of energy)}
<D>__{but then why give the rape to me?}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{that's where it gets a little strange.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{and what about the guy that was following me?}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{now you're really getting paranoid.}
<A>__{lenny collapses on the couch, rubbing his temples.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{the question is not whether i am paranoid, but whether i am paranoid enough. you want to rub my neck?}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{mace sits next to him and starts to work. strong, knowing fingers. lenny starts to relax a little.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{how's zander?}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{ok. he asks about you all the time. it's been weeks since you've seen him.}
<A>__{lenny sort of keels over. his head slumps in her lap.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{i'm sorry about getting on your case earlier. i just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and i anyway. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{lenny}
<P>__{(drifting off, joking)}
<D>__{s'okay. i know you still love me.}
<A>__{she looks down at him, gently brushes his hair off his sweaty forehead in an unconsciously maternal gesture. he is out cold. mace gazes at lenny's sleeping face in a way we haven't seen before: unguarded. caring. loving. and we get it: she does love him. it makes no sense, and it is a great burden to her that he doesn't see her... but there it is. she shakes it off: she doesn't want to deal with it now. maybe not ever. she leans her head back against the ratty top of the couch, sighs. and keeps her hand moving soothingly on his head.}
