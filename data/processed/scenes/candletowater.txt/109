<A>__{swerves near him, splashing him with headlights. jaden looks, sees faces he doesn't want to see. he speeds up and then runs down a side street. the bmw follows. now jaden runs, runs, runs this is our first scene over again. the streets blur around him into a narrative of his life: the urban landscape dancing to the beat of his feet. but jaden wasn't born to run. dodging up an alley he slows, turns. the bmw doors open. three men get out, follow him. the glint and sound of shanks being drawn, ready. breathing hard but measured, paul turns and faces them: a big black guy, an ugly white guy and a tall chinese guy. jaden feels the bulge in his belt at the base of his spine.}
