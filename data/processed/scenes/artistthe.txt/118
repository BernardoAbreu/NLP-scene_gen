<L>__{interior peppy's house storeroom day}
<D>__{in the room with all the sheets, peppy is with the maid. the maid seems to be telling her what happened with george, how he removed all the sheets, etc. peppy listens with an inscrutable expression on her face. then, suddenly overcome by a terrible thought, she rushes outside.}
<L>__{exterior peppy's house day}
<D>__{she runs out of the house and over to the car, but the chauffeur isn't there. she honks the horn to call him but there's no response. she honks the horn again, then, not wanting to wait any longer, and seeing the keys on the dashboard, she gets behind the wheel, starts the engine and pulls off in a series of kangaroo hops. it's obvious that she doesn't know how to drive all that well, but still goes at full speed more or less successfully. just as she passes through the gate, the chauffeur turns up. too late. he sees her drive away.}
