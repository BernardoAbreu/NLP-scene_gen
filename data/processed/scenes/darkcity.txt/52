<A>__{tight on drawing pins being pushed into a map. a seeming random pattern across the terrain of the city. each pin is labelled: victim 1, victim 2,... etc.}

<A>__{he's tired, like he hasn't slept. he's looking at the map stuck to a wall. there's several neat piles of folders on the kitchen table in front of him. the kitchen itself is incredibly neat everything completely organized. bumstead shakes his head slowly, turns away from the board. picks up a cup of hot tea, pours milk into it from a small jar. tight on the tea cup cream swirls into a rapidly dissolving spiral. bumstead looks up. puts down the cup hurriedly, turns back to the map. with a thick pen he traces a line between each point marking the location of the victims. he steps back to examine his handiwork. a spiral moving outwards. beyond the last victim it becomes a dotted line, following the same trajectory but with a big question mark beside it. bumstead glances over to a blackboard with a list of names and addresses on it. he holds up the doctor's card and stares at it. he turns it over, notices an address on the back.}
