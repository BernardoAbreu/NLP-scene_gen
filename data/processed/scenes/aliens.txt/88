<L>__{interior complex}
<A>__{the group stands before a bizarre tableau. among the refinerylike lattice of pipes and conduits something new and not of human design had been added. it is a structure of some sort, extending from and crudely imitating the complex of plumbing, but made of some strange encrusted substance. it vaguely resembles the chambered nests of swallows on a much larger scale, and it attenuates so gradually into the original hardware that it is hard to see where one ends and the other begins. the alien structure seems to extend far back into the complex of machinery. the plant thrums loudly, its functioning seemingly not impaired.}
