<L>__{ext iron springs dawn}
<A>__{a camp near a waterhole with 2 cowboys crouched by a fire, sipping coffee. wyatt's men ride up to the rocks overlooking it and dismount, unseen.}
<C>__{mcmasters}
<D>__{there they are. no herd though.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{we'll go around that way, come up on foot.}
<A>__{they pull shotguns from their saddles and start down over the rocks on foot, creeping up on the camp, seemingly undetected. but suddenly the cowboys by the fire dive behind a log and:}
<C>__{mcmasters}
<D>__{ambush! get down!}
<A>__{and suddenly the deadfall on the opposite side explodes in gunfire. vermillion takes a graze and drops with the others, hugging the rocks. a bullet richochets into a rock at johnson's head, biting his face with fragments, making him wince:}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{christ!}
<A>__{hunched behind the logs on the opposite side with 15 more cowboys, curly bill raises his head, grinning and shouting:}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{hey, wyatt! how the hell are you?}
<A>__{wyatt and his men react to his voice. the fire continues. suddenly there's movement in the rocks above them. doc points:}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{look!}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{got some boys workin' around those rocks behind you. another minute or two, gonna have you in a crossfire! how do you like that?}
<A>__{seeing the spot they're in, mcmasters turns to the silent wyatt:}
<C>__{mcmasters}
<D>__{he's right. they get set up in them rocks it's the end for us.}
<A>__{and now for the first time we see fear in these men, actual naked fear. but curly bill laughs, having the time of his life.}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{'course you could give yourselves up and we could have a party! then what larks!}
<A>__{crouched by curly bill, barnes chuckles. a confident ripple of laughter goes through the cowboy line they know they've got them. on the other side, vermillion shakes his head grimly.}
<C>__{vermillion}
<D>__{ain't takin' me alive, damn it!}
<A>__{mcmasters looks at the still silent wyatt, shrugging helplessly:}
<C>__{mcmasters}
<D>__{think of somethin' fast or we're cooked.}
<A>__{they really are at the end of their rope, all looking to wyatt for a solution. he remains silent. then suddenly, in this supreme moment, a strange, almost supernatural calm seems to come over him and he says simply:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{and now we can almost hear the ether ringing in our ears as wyatt takes his shotgun and, while the others look on in horror, rises to his feet.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{wyatt!}
<A>__{bullets whiz around him. doc jumps up to grab him but a ricochet drives him back down. wyatt advances quickly across the clearing, walking right into the teeth of their guns, repeating:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{no...}
<A>__{wyatt's clothes jerk and ripple as bullets pass through, but he just keeps coming. seeing this, curly bill also stands, a weird, manic elation coming over him. he hoots and howls:}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{look at that! yeah! come and get some, boy!}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{no...}
<A>__{curly bill waves away his men's fire and walks toward wyatt,}
