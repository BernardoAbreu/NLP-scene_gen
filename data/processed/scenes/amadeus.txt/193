<L>__{interior old salieri's hospital room night 1823}
<A>__{old salieri is now wildly animated, totally driven by his confession to vogler.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{my plan was so simple, it terrified me. first i must get the death mass and then achieve the death.}
<A>__{vogler stares at him in horror.}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{his funeral imagine it! the cathedral, all vienna sitting there. his coffin, mozart's little coffin in the middle. and suddenly in that silence, music. a divine music bursts out over them all, a great mass of death: requiem mass for wolfgang mozart, composed by his devoted friend antonio salieri. what sublimity! what depth! what passion in the music! salieri has been touched by god at last. and god, forced to listen. powerless powerless to stop it. i at the end, for once, laughing at him. do you understand? do you?}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{the only thing that worried me was the actual killing. how does one do that? how does one kill a man? it's one thing to dream about it. it's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.}
<A>__{he raises his own hands and stares at them. the raging dies irae from mozart's requiem mass bursts upon us.}
