<C>__{longshanks}
<D>__{my son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. so he accepted our bribe.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{no. he did not.}
<C>__{longshanks}
<D>__{then why does he stay? my scouts say he has not advanced.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{he waits. for you. he says he will attack no more towns if you are man enough to come fight him.}
<C>__{longshanks}
<D>__{you spoke with this wallace in private. what kind of man is he?}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{...a mindless barbarian. not a king like you, m'lord.}
<C>__{longshanks}
<D>__{the scottish nobles have sent him no support. his army starves. our stall has worked, he must withdraw. you may return to your embroidery.}
<C>__{princess}

<D>__{forgive me, sire. i thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.}
<C>__{longshanks}
<D>__{my greatness is better demonstrated with this.}
<A>__{from a box at his feet the king withdraws a crossbow and throws it onto the table. most of those there are shocked.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{the weapon has been outlawed by the pope himself!}
<C>__{longshanks}
<D>__{so the scots will have none of them, will they? my armorers have already made a thousand.}
