<L>__{interior church, steenwyck's quarters morning}
<A>__{in the church: it's crowded with families. pews filled with bedding and belongings. steenwyck comes to close the double doors of his quarters, turning, angry.}
<C>__{father steenwyck}
<D>__{you are astonishing, constable. do you truly think your ridiculous accusations frighten me?}
<A>__{ichabod is doing nothing to hide his disdain.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{only if i repeat them outside this room. and, i will if i must...}
<P>__{(points to doors)}
<D>__{out there, for all to hear. or... you may speak, as planned. but, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.}
<C>__{father steenwyck}
<D>__{no. you will not run me out. no one will believe a word of what you say.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{oh? far as i can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.}
<C>__{father steenwyck}
<D>__{are you a deist? is that it? a free thinker who does not believe in divinity.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{it is only important what you are. an adulterer...}
<C>__{father steenwyck}
<D>__{i am the lord's voice in this town.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{wallowing in sin and lust...}
<C>__{father steenwyck}
<D>__{they need guidance.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{wallowing quite literally in blood.}
<C>__{father steenwyck}
<P>__{(snapping, quaking)}
<D>__{damn you, sir! god damn you to hell!}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{he may. but, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf.}
<A>__{ichabod walks. steenwyck is humiliated.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{you are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.}
<C>__{father steenwyck}
<D>__{you cannot do this. i am a man of god!}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, father. that is the closest you ever come to god.}
