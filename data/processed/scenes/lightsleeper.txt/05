<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{confessor letour}
<A>__{rain falls on letour's car near an east side luxury high rise. the door opens to eddie's apartment: severe decor, once chic, now dated. eddie, thirty two, is a mess: puffy face, sweaty shirt, pinched lips on a drug jag.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{le tour! finally. what took so long?}
<C>__{letour}
<P>__{(steps inside)}
<D>__{traffic. it's raining.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{how's things?}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i need a quarter you got it?}
<C>__{letour}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{robert said he sold you a quarter yesterday.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(slurs)}
<D>__{some friends came over. how much is that? fourteen hundred?}
<A>__{letour nods as eddie, employing diminished skills, counts from a roll of twenties. john looks around: full ashtrays, porn tapes, empty vodka bottles there have been no "friends."}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{eddie. look at yourself. sit down. i've known you, what, like eight years?}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(counting)}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{knew you from the other job, the one before the last one you fucked up. i knew your wife remember her? we used to sit and talk and talk }
<A>__{pressures eddie into chair.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(whining)}
<D>__{you don't know what she was like }
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{this is no good. i will sell you a gram and some downs, but i ain't gonna put you in the emergency room. cool it. go to bed. sleep it off.}
<A>__{john's beeper goes off.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(stands)}
<D>__{you charge $200 for what goes for ninety on the street and you're not gonna sell?}
<C>__{letour}
<P>__{(clicks beeper)}
<D>__{so go to the street.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i will call ann.}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{go ahead. you know what she'll say. phone's over there.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(irrational)}
<D>__{i will tell the fucking cops.}
<C>__{letour}
<P>__{(flashes cold)}
<D>__{fuck you. that's it. you're out.}
<P>__{(turns to leave)}
<D>__{don't call again. catch you next lifetime.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(contrite)}
<D>__{please, tour, i'm sorry. you're right. i didn't mean that. i'm quitting anyway. i will take the gram. sorry.}
<C>__{letour}
<P>__{(turns back)}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{two hundred?}
<A>__{letour nods. eddie counts $200 as letour takes a gram from his pouch, gives it to him.}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{you got downs?}
<P>__{(eddie nods)}
<D>__{one more thing. i gotta use the phone.}
<A>__{eddie pockets the envelope as john, checking his beeper, walks to the phone. later. letour sits in an upper west side apartment as an earnest mid twentiesh man, wearing undershorts, snorts a hefty line, offers a rolled dollar bill as he talks. letour declines.}
<D>__{mid twentiesh man}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...but if there's no god, how can man conceive of him? the idea of god presupposes the existence of god. that's the ontological argument. anselm. twelve hundred. fourteen hundred i'm not sure }
<C>__{letour}
<P>__{(checks his watch)}
<D>__{i've got to go. mid twentiesh man}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{let me finish. okay, if the idea of god is implanted by god the sensus divinitatus, the sense of the divine what is the role of human thought? not faith, thought...}
<A>__{letour's mind drifts. his diary voice overlaps:}
<C>__{letour}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{everybody wants to talk. it's like a compulsion. my philosophy is: you got nothing to say, don't say it. they figure you can tell a d.d. anything, things they would never tell anyone else. he understands. of course they're stoned to start. if i could tie together all the hours of coke talk i've heard, that would be a lot of string. it was robert's idea to add twenty five dollars to home deliveries cause it's such a hassle. fifty is more like it.}
<A>__{later. narration continues as sedan drives through rain. later. a tribeca loft. letour swaps drug jargon with two n.y.u. students at an impromptu party. attractive ingenues drift by. trendy twosome, blasted, sways, to techno rap. business done, letour turns to leave. the first student grabs his shoulder:}
<C>__{first student}
<D>__{c'mon, tour, stick around.}
<C>__{second student}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{first student}
<D>__{there's only four of us and like seven of them and we're paying for the dope. see her, over there, the blonde, long hair, yellow skirt? she's gonna model for elite.}
<A>__{downtown nymph, sixteen going on seventeen.}
<C>__{letour}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{me? i'm an old man. she'd break me like an old horse.}
<C>__{second student}
<D>__{shit, dude }
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{nah. thanks anyway.}
<P>__{(checks watch)}
<D>__{i gotta go. have fun.}
<P>__{(heads toward exit)}
