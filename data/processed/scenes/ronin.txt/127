<A>__{the car zooms off into the night and as it does a light rain starts to fall and we }
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior a chateau outside of paris night}
<A>__{the same rain falls, more of a steady mist than a rain. the mist gleams electrically in the thousand watt lights which shine from the chateau. hundreds of years old, it sits far back from its own main gate. in front of the chateau armed men. lots of them. whatever this place is, it's not one that invites company. now we're moving towards the chateau, and as we move we get a glimpse of the surrounding environment: ancient statues, sitting benches in private gardens, small pools of fish you name it, this place has it. we hear voices, and they're talking in russian. heavy, thick russian, punctuated with words like "da!" and "nyet!" making it clear that we've reached the address of the russian production company. behind the chateau more gardens, more everything. it's well patrolled, but there aren't quite as many guards back here as there are out front, because bordering the chateau is a natural fotress a woods a forest, really. filled with ancient trees, almost mythic in appearance, and for all the light of the chateau this place is darkness visible light comes here and dies. and in this woods, looking out, we find vincent and sam. heavily armed, they've just humped god knows how many miles through the woods to get here. both men exhausted from the walk sam from his wound, vincent from his smoking habit. they collapse and vincent takes out his cigarettes. even though they're screened from the chateau back here, sam reaches over and takes the cigarettes out of vincent's hands.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{not here. they might see it.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{if i'm going to die for the cia, i'm going to go out smoking.}
<P>__{(takes the cigarettes back and lights one)}
<D>__{besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.}
<A>__{vincent offers one to sam, who declines with a shake of his head.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{time to quit.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{just like that?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{not just like that... just before i turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing i do when i wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(obviously he does this)}
<D>__{what of it?}
<P>__{(almost to himself)}
<D>__{samurai pain in the ass.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(he hates this)}
<D>__{would you stop with that...}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{why? you've got more force of will than anyone i've ever seen. you handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...}
<P>__{(quick beat)}
<D>__{and most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(qith a cynical laugh)}
<D>__{the mark of a true samurai.}
<P>__{(seriously)}
<D>__{what i do for the company, vincent, is no different than what you do. we're both hired guns, and this is a job like any other job.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{why then, sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other? surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{because i don't walk away.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's the one thing i've got left to hold onto.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{jean pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{closest and oldest.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and yet you would have killed him to save my life.}
<P>__{(quick beat)}
<D>__{you have a sense of honor, vincent, that i can't even remember anymore. i don't know that i ever even had it to begin with. all i know to do, vincent, is to finish my job.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{and when you finish? what then? this package, whatever it is, do you give it to the cia? do you really think they deserve it?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that's a good question.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{do you have a good answer?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(he's really just considering this)}
<D>__{no, i don't.}
