<L>__{exterior cave and plains utopia}
<A>__{babies were born and sometimes lived; feeble, toothless thirty year olds died; the lion took its toll in the night; the others threatened daily across the river â€“ and the trib prospered. in the course of a single year, moonwatcher and his companions had changed almost beyond recognition. they had become as plump as the family in the cave, who no longer haunted their dreams. they had learned their lessons well; now they could handle all the stone tools and weapons that the cube had revealed to them. they were no longer half numbed with starvation, and they had time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought. their new way of life was casually accepted, and they did not associate it in any way with the crystal cube still standing outside their cave. but no utopia is perfect, and this one had two blemishes. the first was the marauding lion, whose passion for hominids seemed to have grown even stronger now that they were better nourished. the second was the tribe across the river; for somehow the others had survived, and had stubbornly refused to die of starvation.}
