<L>__{interior hospital hallway later}
<A>__{on her way down the hall betty passes a patient's room when the sound of a person moaning stops her. she can't help but go inside. a tv plays commercials. an older woman lies in bed, alone and staring at the ceiling. betty looks around and notices several arrangements of flowers on a deserted nightstand. she brings them over to the older woman's bedside, positions them, then gently strokes her head.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{there... you rest now.}
<A>__{the woman's eyes flutter. she is disoriented at first, then calms as she adjusts to the comforting sight of betty. betty takes her hand.}
<C>__{older woman}
<D>__{who... who're you?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i'm... i'm nurse betty.}
<A>__{the woman smiles serenely at this and begins to drift off. betty checks her monitors as the opening credits of "a reason to love" begin to play. she glances up at the doorway at the same moment and sees dr. david ravell standing at the entrance. he checks the chart on the door, smiles warmly at betty and then moves off. in a flash, betty is up and after him. the theme music is her private soundtrack as she checks out every man in surgical scrubs, looking for david ravell. then... she sees him. in all his glory at the end of a corridor walking away from her. betty gives chase. she gains steadily on him, her heart racing. as they near emergency the noise level picks up. he stops at the nurses' station. betty closes the gap. she starts to run.}

<D>__{david!!!}
<A>__{he turns to face her ... it's not david ravell.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{sorry, i thought you were someone else.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{do you know dr. david ravell?}
<A>__{the man shakes his head. betty keeps going, looking around: it's incredible the size, the activity, the intensity.}
