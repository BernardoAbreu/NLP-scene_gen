<L>__{interior living room sheldrake house day}
<A>__{the decor is split level early american. there is a huge christmas tree and a jumble of presents, open gift boxes, and discarded wrappings. sheldrake and his two sons, tommy and jeff jr., are squatting on the floor, testing a cape canaveral set the kids got for christmas. sheldrake is in a brand new dressing gown, with a manufacturer's tag still dangling from it, and the boys are in pajamas and astronaut's helmets. as for the cape canaveral set, it is a miniature layout of block houses, launching pads, and assorted space missiles. tommy has his finger on the button controlling one of the rockets.}
