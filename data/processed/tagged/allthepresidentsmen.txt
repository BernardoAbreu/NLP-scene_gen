(5) finally, all this can show in reality is that they are desperate, and i would rather let the actors give that to us. i feel that it would be a genuine error at this time in the flick to go into the convolutions of how it's bad manners for a reporter to burn a source, if we've got anything going by this point, i can't conceive of much an audience will be less interested in than the reporters misbehaving. however, if the scene is requested next time through, i shall be only too happy to oblige. what i would like to do is cut from the fbi saying "fuck you fuck you fuck you" and locking his door to the following: woodward and bernstein walking in the rain. it's pouring as they leave fbi headquarters and they are in anguish.}
