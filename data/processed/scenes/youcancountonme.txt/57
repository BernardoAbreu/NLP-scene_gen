<A>__{he moves rudy's hand down toward the end of the handle.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{you hold it further down, you're gonna get a lot more power. you should be able to put that nail down with two or three hits. look:}
<A>__{with two swift strokes he drives the nail flush into the wood.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{try it.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{that's not the way i hold it.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{well, the way you hold it is wrong.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{why can't i just do it my own way?}

<C>__{terry}
<P>__{(shrugs)}

<A>__{he goes back to work. rudy resumes hammering. after a moment he switches his grip and starts hammering terry's way. terry looks up and watches him.}
