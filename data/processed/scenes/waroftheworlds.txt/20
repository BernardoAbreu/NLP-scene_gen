<L>__{interior mary ann's house basement night}
<A>__{bushes are heard rattling against the window. they become louder and louder against the window. eventually they become just shy of loud enough to wake ray up. flash! a strike of lighting gets ray's eyes to roll back around and open. bam! the second flash is loud enough to get robbie (who is now in the seat next to ray) to jump up next to him. a few more flashes and the lightening starts like the first time. bam! bam! every strike of lighting lights up the entire downstairs. rachel gets up and looks thought the stairs. a close up shot of robbie. with every lightening strike, his breathing becomes more erratic.}

<D>__{is the lighting back?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{no, this is something else...}
<A>__{just as ray finishes, an ear piercing noise from a jet engine begins. the howl rattles things off of shelves on the walls. robbie and ray wince at the pain in their ears. rachel runs up to robbie and hugs him in security. things fall off of shelves everywhere. a shot of the incredibly bright window as the noise grows even louder.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(screams) ahhhh... what's that sound?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i never heard that before!!!}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{is it them!!! is it them!!!}
<A>__{the lighting grows more intense as does the sound.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{we gotta go!! where do we go??? robbie, this is your house, where do we go??}
<A>__{robbie opens the door to the furnace room and shows rachel down the stairs who runs. robbie goes back to get ray. ray realizes he has forgotten his gun.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{wait!! wait!! wait!! wait!!}
<A>__{ray and robbie run to the door just as a fireball bursts through the windows. flaming debris follows after. ray gets the first door closed but the fire blasts through the wooden one. he manages, after a struggle, to get the metal one closed on the inside of the furnace room. the door closes and the room is completely black. in the dark, you can hear the debris being thrown around everywhere around them.}

<D>__{are we still alive?}
