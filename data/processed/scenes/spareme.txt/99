<L>__{exterior billboard day}
<A>__{the billboard fills the frame. it reads "paradise putt putt", and underneath: "a heavenly experience." a motorized cheesy looking smiling dwarf angel swings a golden club.}
<L>__{exterior mini golf course}
<A>__{miniature golf obstacles are bathed in the light of the setting sun. the camera passes a huge cement centaur surrounded by astro carpeting.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{i just hold it loosely with both hands?}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{that's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. then grasp firmly. the camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini green.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{grasp firmly. then what?}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{line up where you want it.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{now swing it out a little to the right...}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{like this?}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{no, no, that's too far. try a more gentle stroke. it's all in the stroke. go ahead, now, honey stroke. as the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman. his back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{strokin'. here goes nothin'.}
<A>__{she swings a club, sending a golf ball puttering into a cup.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{hole in one! you're the queen of stroke!}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{yippy!}
<A>__{theo strides towards the couple. the man under the halo is (more) buzz. he raises the club at the approaching theo, keeping the woman in front of him as a shield. the front of buzz's cap reads "i'm no angel."}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{get away from me!}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{who the hell are you?}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{hi dad.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{dad? you said you was single.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{we ain't married no more.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{he says that to all his wives.}
<A>__{as she tries to wiggle away from him, the club conks buzz on the noodle, squishing his halo.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(freeing herself to buzz)}
<D>__{geez maynard, is he telling the truth?}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{don't pay him any mind, sweetheart.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you're a nice guy, maynard, but if you got two wives i ain't into no polybigamy. buzz is silent. he takes the club out of her hand. she steps away startled then turns and jogs away. buzz throws down his club in a fury.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{goddam it! i was just about to make a love connection. you sure got a way with women. you show up, women get away.}
<C>__{theo}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{the whole world thinks you're underground.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{i am underground.}
<A>__{buzz removes his damaged cap.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{it could just as easily have been me in that box.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{i told you to get lost. you forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{what about bowling?}
<C>__{buzz}
<P>__{(takes a practice swing)}
<D>__{bowling died for me years ago. besides, i'm a living dead legend. i'm a hero.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{you're a scumbag.}
<A>__{buzz pats his hair down and slips the cap back on his head.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{i'm a live scumbag.}
<A>__{theo digs into his pocket and retrieves the golf ball. he tosses it to buzz.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{nice knowing you, dad.}
<A>__{theo turns and walks towards his car. buzz pauses and walks after him.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{so, eh, you never saw me. right?}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{i never saw you.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{thanks, kid.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{where are you goin' now?}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{i'm goin' straight. no more short cuts. theo gets into the car. buzz leans in the open window.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.}
<P>__{(hands theo his card)}
<D>__{just make sure nobody's following you. buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{i didn't mean that stuff i said. i was trying to keep you out of this muddle. i'm glad i didn't have my tubes tied. oh, and by the way, i made a call for you before i uh retired. buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.}
<C>__{buzz}
<P>__{(hands the card back)}
<D>__{you give ed klein of the american bowling congress a call.}
<P>__{(taps the card)}
<D>__{tell him your maynard's boy. he's expecting you, and he owes me. he'll getcha back in like flynn.}
<P>__{(pats theo's cheek)}
<D>__{don't say i never gave you nothing.}
<C>__{theo}
<P>__{(cracks a half smile)}
<D>__{see ya 'round maynard.}
<A>__{buzz backs away from the car as theo peels out in reverse. buzz stands and watches as theo pulls away.}
