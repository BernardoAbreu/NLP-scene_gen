<L>__{interior the pentagon day}
<A>__{indy, brody, and marion, looking very stylish, are seated in colonel musgrove's huge office. sun pours in a window, through which washington can be seen sparkling across the potomac. everything is neat and clean and regular. including the three men who are arrayed around the office. two we know col. musgrove and maj. eaton. the third is an unnamed bureaucrat. he hangs back, smiling and genial, his features obscured by the glare of the window. he doesn't say anything, yet you have a sense that the others defer to him in the matter at hand. he is the essence of all that is byzantine and inscrutable in our scrubbed government machine. indy and brody are dissatisfied with the way the meeting has gone. marion, on the other hand, is very happy and eager to get out of there. eaton's manner is irritatingly cheery.}

<D>__{oh, it will be, dr. jones, i assure you. we have top men working on it right now.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{eaton}
<D>__{top men.}
<A>__{indy exchanges a look with brody.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{we may be able to help.}
<C>__{eaton}
<D>__{we appreciate that. and we won't hesitate to call on you.}
<C>__{musgrove}

<D>__{thank you all. thank you again.}
<A>__{indy looks them over coldly. he gets up, sullen.}
