<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior sub bay}
<A>__{tight on bud's eyes, as monk's fingers insert acrylic scleral lenses under his eyelids so he can see in the fluid helmet. wider reveals bud is wearing the seals' deep suit. everybody is grouped around, buckling and zipping. he is hyperventilating with an oxygen mask, part of the procedure for transitioning from air to fluid breathing. monk, on his stretcher, is presiding. the resident expert. lindsey is wrapped in a blanket, still looking wan and frail. she doesn't have the strength to resist bud's will, but she's trying.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{no, bud, no... not you.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{who then?}
<A>__{she looks around at the others. sees their eyes. the fear. has her answer. he lowers the helmet over his head. catfish clamps it down. we see what's driving him... his sense of responsibility for these people, for not being able to prevent this situation. he touches her cheek, one last time. she sees his fingers are trembling. then he puts on the gloves. catifsh is strapping a keypad unit onto bud's forearm. lindsey wants to scream... to stop this madness.}
<C>__{bud }
<D>__{so i will hear you, but i can't talk?}
<C>__{monk}
<D>__{the fluid prevents your larynx from making sound. it'll feel a little strange.}
<C>__{bud }
<D>__{warning you now, folks, i'm a lousy typist.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{the moment of truth, huh?}
<A>__{his breathing is shallow and tense. he looks at lindsey. the eyes of a condemned man. she squeezes his hand. he takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{okay. let's rock and roll.}
<A>__{monk gently cracks a valve on the suit's feed line. the breathing fluid (3m fluorocarbon emulsion fx 80) swirls into the helmet. bud reflexively raises his chin. the liquid fills toward his mouth.}
<C>__{monk}
<D>__{relax now, bud. just keep breathing as it fills... don't fight it. take it in. just let yourself take it in.}
<A>__{suddenly, there's nothing in there to breathe but liquid. his eyes go wide, instant panic. he starts to thrash. chest heaving.}
<C>__{monk}
<D>__{hold him. hold him. this is normal... it'll pass in a second. you're gonna be okay. we all breathe liquid for nine months, bud. your body will remember.}
<A>__{lindsey grabs bud's shoulders, steadying him. he finds her eyes, the look calming him. he's passed into a realm from which she has already returned. his spasms subside. he begins to "breathe" normally. he gets a goofy look of wonder on his face, not really believing what he's experiencing. he is alive, alert and quite completely drowned inside the fbs helmet. he grins. gives a big thumbs up. lindsey picks up a microphone.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{can you hear me okay?}
<P>__{(another thumbs up)}
<D>__{try your keypad.}
<A>__{bud taps out a brief message. feels weird you should try this prints out on their portable monitor.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{i already have, moron.}
<A>__{they help bud to the edge of the dive platform. jammer and hippy lower little geek into the water and bud grabs onto it. hippy yells right up next to his helmet.}
<C>__{hippy}
<D>__{i redid little geek's chip the same as big geek! he should take you right to it. all you gotta do is hang on!}
<A>__{lindsey crouches at the edge to watch bud submerge. he looks up at her as he drops away. in a few seconds, she can't see him. her chin quivers, minutely.}
