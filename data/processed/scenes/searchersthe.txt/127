<L>__{exterior the jorgensen house med. shot ethan and martin}
<A>__{the passage of time has stamped martin and will continue during our story more and more to stamp him in the image of ethan. now it may show only in the set of his hat or trick of standing; later it will be in his walk, in his speech (or paucity of speech). neither man is sure of his reception. they are thinking of brad dead because of their search; and martin is thinking of laurie. and then mrs. jorgensen is running across to martin and has him in her arms as though he were her son saying nothing, just holding him. he stands frozen a moment and then he returns the embrace. ethan watches a moment, then crosses to jorgensen.}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(to jorgensen)}
<D>__{you got my letter about your son, brad?}
<C>__{jorgensen}
<D>__{yah... just about this time a year ago...}
<C>__{mrs. jorgensen}
<D>__{it came the day before his... birthday.}
<C>__{jorgensen}
<D>__{the lord giveth the lord taketh away...}
<A>__{mrs. jorgensen starts to lead the way inside. martin hangs back.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i ain't fit to go indoors, miz jorgensen... these clothes is...}
<A>__{laurie rushes past her mother.}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{martie!}
<A>__{she kisses him hard and full on the mouth and has no eyes for anyone else. mrs. jorgensen looks on with amusement. martin is just bowled over.}
<C>__{mrs. jorgensen}
<P>__{(teasing)}
<D>__{and him probably forgettin' all about you!... probably can't even call your name to mind.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{laurie.}
<A>__{and laurie smiles triumphantly at her mother.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{but i fairly forgot just how pretty you was...}
<A>__{laurie grabs his hand then and pulls him indoors and there is no further resistance from martin. mrs. jorgensen and her husband converge then on ethan and her face is gravely questioning.}
<C>__{mrs. jorgensen}
<D>__{the little one?... debbie?}
<A>__{ethan shakes his head. she squeezes his arm reassuringly and they start indoors.}
