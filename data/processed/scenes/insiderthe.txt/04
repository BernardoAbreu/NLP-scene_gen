<L>__{interior a house in lebanon day}
<A>__{a round faced man in his mid forties, with large framed glasses, black hair and a grey black beard, wearing a dullbend, a turban, sits informally at a kitchen table... it's the sheikh fadlallah whose face stares out at us from walls. a gunman cradling an ak 47 sits in an incongruous purple armchair in a corner. a torn poster of the seychelles is on one wall. another gunman stands by a window. lowell is sat down in a chair at the kitchen table...}
<C>__{the sheikh}
<D>__{coffee?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{yeah... thank you.}
<C>__{the sheikh}
<D>__{how have you liked your stay?}
<C>__{lowell}
<P>__{(droll)}
<D>__{what i've seen ...i've liked.}
<A>__{the sheikh smiles. and the smile passes as quickly as it came. a steaming cup of coffee in a small arabic demitasse is put down.}
<C>__{the sheikh}
<D>__{please to explain, why i should agree to interview...with pro zionist american media?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{because i think hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. so you care about what you're thought of in america. and in america, at this moment in time, hezbollah does not have a face.}
<P>__{(confident)}
<D>__{that's why.}
<A>__{and we've first realized this man is not a hostage; he's come here voluntarily.}
<C>__{the sheikh}
<D>__{perhaps you prove}
<A>__{journalism objectivity}
<D>__{and i see the questions first. then i decide if i grant the interview.}
<C>__{lowell}
<P>__{(blunt)}
<D>__{no. we don't do that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you've seen "60 minutes" and mike wallace. so you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. you also know we are the highest rated, most respected, tv magazine news show in america.}
<A>__{the sheikh quietly looks out his glasses at him, studying him. and lowell "closes":}
<C>__{lowell }
<D>__{so. mr. wallace. should he get on a plane or not?}
<A>__{the sheikh thinks it over and then...}
<C>__{the sheikh}
<D>__{tell him i will see him day after tomorrow.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{that's good. that works.}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{uh, you know, i want to ask you something...i know it sounds odd...but...}
<A>__{it's quiet...too quiet...}
<C>__{lowell }
<D>__{hello, sheikh...?}
<P>__{(no answer)}
<D>__{hello, sheikh...?}
<A>__{silence. he hesitates, starts to lift his blindfold... he lifts it. and he sees the sheikh, and his gunmen, are gone. the house empty. only his cameraman, the lanky man, left there, standing by the door still in his blindfold...}
<C>__{lowell }
<D>__{norman.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what? what?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{take your blindfold off.}
<A>__{the lanky man does and we see the cameraman is asian american.}
<C>__{lowell }
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{welcome to the world.}
<A>__{norman gives lowell an ironic look and tests the local current at an electrical outlet.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{fluctuating all over the place. anywhere we shoot, here, it's gonna be portable gennies and we'll run cable...}
<A>__{lowell nods and opens the curtains from this commanding height. baalbek and the beqa'a valley below gold domed mosques. a moment of triumph. he dials his cell phone...}
<C>__{mike wallace's voice }
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{lowell}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{mike, it's me. we're on...}
<A>__{and we hear people laughing and encouraging "go ahead... open it..."}
