<L>__{interior jim's classroom day}
<A>__{jim is hunkered over his desk. he's a wreck: dark, dark circles under his eyes; his hair didn't dry right frizzy here, matted there. and he's near tears. larry fouch and his retinue enter cheerfully}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{okay, mr. m.}
<A>__{larry drops the ballot box on jim's desk}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what? right. so let's start counting.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{well, i thought that... well, the way it always works is that sga president does a count, then the sga advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{fine. so do your count. start with president, and i will be right back.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you have the key, mr. mcallister.}
<A>__{jim doesn't understand at first, then}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{right. i know.}
<A>__{jim proceeds to sort through his cluttered desk drawers but can't seem to find the key. the council members exchange concerned looks as jim's search becomes frenzied.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{are you okay, mr. m.?}
<C>__{another student}
<D>__{what happened to your eye?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i'm fine. it's just a bee sting, a simple little everyday bee sting. some people, they get stung, it's no big deal. me, i swell up. okay?}
<A>__{jim emerges from the drawer wielding a vise grip. he goes to the box and tears the entire hardware assembly off. holding the mangled lock, he turns to the students, who look back stunned.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{i just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. we don't have much time until eighth period. i have other things going on, too, you know.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{okay. yeah. we know}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{all right. i will be back}
