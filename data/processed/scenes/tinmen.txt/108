<A>__{tilley and bb come out of the club and start to look for a place in the lot where there's some room to fight. the crowd eagerly follows right on the heels of bb and tilley. bb and tilley both take off their sports jackets.}
<C>__{bb}
<P>__{(seeing the people gathering around)}
<D>__{what is this? what is this crowd here? we're charging admission?}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{back away... give me some elbow room.}
<A>__{bb and tilley both take up fighting stances and circle one another looking to take a shot. a police car pulls into the lot. the sound of the tires on the gravel catches moe's attention and he sees it's the police.}
<C>__{moe}
<P>__{(quietly to bb and tilley)}
<D>__{police!}
<A>__{tilley and bb immediately drop their guards and lean against a car. one cop gets out of the police car and heads into the club, the other cop stays behind in the car. no one knows quite what to do since the policeman is so nearby.}

<D>__{against the car;}
<P>__{to bb)}
<D>__{you're a lucky man... the police showed.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{we'll see who's the lucky one.}
