<A>__{eric stokes a fire at the mouth of the shelter. corbett's pants and boots hang to dry from branches next to it. he huddles under the tarp, covered by his coat, drowsy and listless.}

<D>__{stay awake! you want to go hypothermic?}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{if that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.}
<P>__{(yawns)}
<D>__{i will be okay.}
<A>__{eric examines him. corbett's skin is white and rigid, his lips are pale blue. he scowls at eric.}

<D>__{you don't feel cold?}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{it's a spring day...}
<A>__{he starts to doze off. the shivering he's been repressing now racks his body. eric sits him up, closer to the fire, and puts his own parka over corbett's shoulders. with his foot, eric rolls some hot rocks bordering the fire closer to corbett's legs. eric rubs his arms and hands, but it isn't enough. eric loathes the specter of death, even corbett's. he shakes him, trying to keep him awake.}

<D>__{wake up, goddammit! you've got classic hypothermia crankiness, fatigue, can't feel your coldness. worst thing you can do is fade out.}
<A>__{corbett is headed someplace far away. sighing, eric turns him so his back faces the fire. he unbuttons corbett's shirt, then unbuttons his own shirt and lies across corbett. eric gasps corbett feels like a slab of ice. corbett's teeth chatter. he's completely unconscious.}
