<L>__{interior carl's car night}
<A>__{carl, in his red ford mustang, is speeding up town. sam is beside him in the front seat.}
<L>__{interior willie's building night}
<A>__{carl steps into the lobby of willie's building. sam follows, wide eyed. he seems both intrigued and astounded by what carl is doing. when carl stops to read the apartment number on willie's mail box, sam is thrilled.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{way to go, carl!}
<A>__{carl climbs the stairs two at a time and approaches willie's door. he bangs on it, loudly. angle the door opens a crack as willie peers out. carl pushes it hard and it opens the rest of the way. willie steps back.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{carl, what're you doin' here?}
<A>__{sam freezes as willie addresses carl by name. he can barely move.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(scared, in over his head)}
<D>__{who've you been talking to?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{talking to? what the hell do you mean? what's going on?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{some woman knows all about you. the murder, everything. where's she getting it from, huh?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{what the hell are you talking about? i haven't said a word.}
<A>__{sam is staggered. his body is shaking.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{she knows your name, goddamn it! she knows where you live!}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{a lot of women know where i live.}
<A>__{carl is fuming.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{this isn't a joke, man. you find that bitch, whoever she is, and... get rid of her, you hear me? i've got four million dollars stuck in that fucking computer. if i don't get those codes, if that money's not transferred soon, i'm dead. if i lose balistrari's money, we're both dead.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{tell him you only wash dirty money on the first of the month.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{what is wrong with you? is everything a joke? you were supposed to steal his wallet. you weren't supposed to kill him. was that a joke?}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{i did you a favor. freebee.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{jesus!}
<P>__{(sickened)}
<D>__{these are drug dealers, man.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{don't blow this for me, willie. i've risked my job here. i could go to jail. a hundred thousand of that money goes to me. now give me sam's key. i will get that address book myself.}
<A>__{willie goes to the desk drawer and takes out sam's key. sam, unable to control himself, explodes in a fit of rage. hauling back, he slugs carl with all his might. his fist has no impact.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you killed me, carl. you had me killed. look what you've done to me! look what you've done!}
