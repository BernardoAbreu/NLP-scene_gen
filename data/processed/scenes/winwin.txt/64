<D>__{ready? and...wrestle.}
<A>__{vigman blows his whistle and the room erupts in cheering. most of it for jimmy reed except for stemler who is rooting for kyle. jimmy and kyle lock arms but kyle pushes him away. jimmy locks again but kyle pushes him away again. jimmy comes in hard this time and kyle uses his momentum to quickly throw him to the ground. jimmy tries to scramble to his knees but kyle is all over him. he quickly locks jimmy in a cradle and rocks him onto his back. it looks easy. vigman calls the pin. the room is quiet...except for terry.}
