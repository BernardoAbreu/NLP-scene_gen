<L>__{int tunnel night}
<A>__{police flashlights switch on and their beams bounce crazily off the walls of the tunnel. footsteps crunch as they all press in, langdon and vittoria content to let men with guns lead the way. it gets darker as they descend, and then, by the echo of their footfalls, they can tell they've entered }
<B>__{a large chamber.}
<A>__{more lights are switched on, illuminating the space, which terminates in three stone walls.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{it's a dead end.}
<A>__{but the police attention is focused on the black van parked in the center of the room. roman police snap into action, flashlight beams bounce everywhere, guns point in every possible window of the van, shouts for whoever's inside to get the hell out now, now, now. the doors are flung open. the van is empty. except for the two dead policemen from the piazza navona. the police frenzy reaches an even higher level, urgent messages passed along on radios, half the cops turning and heading back out of the tunnel.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{where are they going?}
<A>__{vittoria listens to the orders being given in italian.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{back to search the outer castle.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{no... no, it has to be here!}
<A>__{but there's no stopping the cops, and the only two that remain are posted outside the van, guarding their fallen colleagues.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{robert, it's a dead end.}
<A>__{langdon walks forward, to the stone wall at the end of the tunnel, and feels his way along it. it joins smoothly with the wall on the right side.}
<C>__{vittoria }
<D>__{robert...}
<A>__{but he waves her off, this has to be it. he feels all along the wall toward the other corner, and as he looks down at the ground, his eyes widen.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{bring a flashlight.}
<A>__{vittoria borrows a flashlight from one of the two remaining cops, who now get a crackly message on their walkie talkies and race out of the tunnel, toward the top, leaving langdon and vittoria alone in the dead end. she brings the light to langdon, who shines its beam down at the floor. there, in the corner, is a granite block.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{none of the other blocks are granite. and they're all square.}
<A>__{he bends down, looks closer.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{this one's a pentagram. it points }
<A>__{sure enough, the block is carved in the shape of a pentagram, with the tip pointing into the corner.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{ at nothing.}
<A>__{but as he shines the light, there's something off about the shadow it casts in the corner of the room. it creates an odd, dark slit. langdon crouches in the corner and slides his hand along the back wall of the chamber. when he reaches the point at which it should intersect the side wall his hand disappears.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{the walls overlap.}
<A>__{he flattens himself against the back wall, shining the light straight at what should be the intersection of the walls. half the flashlight's beam falls on the side wall, and the other half }
