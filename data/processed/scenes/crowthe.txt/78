<L>__{interior funboy's room night}
<A>__{a hypodermic needle rises into frame. a nicotined fingernail flicks bubbles in the syringe. follow needle down and broaden angle: funboy taps up a vein in darla's arm and shoots her up. both are naked in a shabby bed. bare lightbulb above.}
<C>__{darla}
<D>__{ooh, baby gimme all of it.}
<A>__{close up the needle as the plunger depresses. angle on the window as the crow quite unexpectedly arrives and perches on the sill, scaring the shit out of our two dopey friends. funboy pulls a giant auto pistol; mock aims, calms down, doesn't fire.}
<C>__{darla}
<D>__{it's a big fucking bird...}
<A>__{she falls back against her pillow, eyes dreamily defocusing. funboy giggles. relaxes the gun, which half disappears into the sheets at his side.}
<C>__{funboy}
<D>__{it's a squab. here bird, here, birdie...}
<A>__{new angle darla and funboy except that eric now stands near their bed, across from the bird's position, the guitar bowslung.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{here funboy.}
<A>__{contained panic as funboy and darla both startle. the needle flies and lands at eric's feet. empty. funboy struggles to maintain against his high.}
<C>__{funboy}
<D>__{oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man. i nearly had a fucking heart attack.}
<C>__{darla}
<D>__{fun look at that guy...}
<C>__{funboy}
<D>__{it's just the dope, don't worry}
<C>__{darla}
<D>__{fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!}
<C>__{funboy}
<D>__{not me.}
<A>__{funboy draws the gun from underneath the sheers. suddenly he seems totally focused.}
<C>__{funboy }
<D>__{time for you to take your bird and leave, freako.}
<A>__{eric rips open his shirtfront to reveal a circlet of bullet punctures. this gives funboy pause.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{take your shot funboy. you got me, dead bang.}
<A>__{funboy tilts the gun off target. grins as eric flat handedly past his chest, indicating where to shoot.}
<C>__{funboy}
<D>__{you are seriously fucked up, man. just look at yourself.}
<A>__{in a blur, he sighs, and shoots eric through the heart.}
<C>__{funboy }
<D>__{bang! he shoots, he scores!}
<A>__{then his expression drags a little bit. angle eric looking down and daubing his hand in the bullet wound on his chest.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{bull's eye. good shot.}
<A>__{angle darla who starts scrambling to get out. grabbing clothes on the floor around herself. she runs right into eric's outstretched hands.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{stay.}
<A>__{eric twists her arm. close up darla's forearm. where we may clearly see the needle tracks. up angle eric}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{morphine is bad for you.}
<A>__{he holds her arm captive. tight, and we push in closer to see the dope evacuating from the punctures, a reverse of eric's, blood trail. the dope drips from darla's arm to the floor. darla's eyes roll up into the unconscious. she slumps. angle on funboy gawping}
<C>__{funboy}
<D>__{how the hell did you do that?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{magic.}
<A>__{funboy regards eric's battlescars and guitar.}
<C>__{funboy}
<D>__{either die or do a solo.}
<A>__{eric looks briefly to his chest wound, wincing. he can't seem to make it tie off fast enough. he turns his attention back to funboy. but his strength is mysteriously ebbing.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{neither.}
<C>__{funboy}
<D>__{yeah, i got a more fun idea myself.}
<A>__{funboy lashes out and broadsides eric across the temple with the gun. eric falls, rolls back to a stance, but funboy is right on top of him, howling like a lunatic and pistol whipping eric relentlessly.}
<C>__{funboy}
<D>__{i hate trespassers!}
<P>__{(whack!)}
<D>__{i hate prowlers!}
<P>__{(whack!)}
<D>__{i hate peeping toms!}
<P>__{(whack!)}
<D>__{and right now i hate you!}
<A>__{angle wall near bathroom as eric, caught off guard by funboy's hyper high and weakened by his wound, comes slamming into the wall, losing his footing. here comes funboy, and we tilt up from eric's position as he looms, cocking the pistol, which now has eric's blood on it.}
<C>__{funboy}
<D>__{ahh, the hell with it, i still got five shots left.}
<A>__{in a blur, eric grabs funboy`s gun hand. twists to the crunching of bones. funboy's skewed around gun hand blows a hole in his own thigh. funboy fall back across the bed.}
<C>__{funboy}
<D>__{owwwaaaa fuck me! look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit! aaaaaa! goddd!}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{does it hurt?}
<C>__{funboy}
<D>__{does it hurt?! you dead ass, clown faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts! what the shit are you gonna do about this?!}
<A>__{eric sits on the bed next to funboy; inspects the ampule of morphine on the nightstand, the needle of the syringe already inserted.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i have some pain killer right here.}
<A>__{and he fills the syringe all the way.}
<B>__{angle on funboy}
<A>__{as he begins to see the light. he can't get away. growing terror.}
<C>__{funboy}
<D>__{no, wait, no wait, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it !}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{your pain ends now.}
<A>__{and eric rams the needle into funboy's heart, driving home the full dose. funboy begins to convulse. eric falls back on the bed, his force spent. darla comes to in the corner, shock traumatized. on o.s. cough, and eric opens his eyes. the skull cowboy, standing in the room, tips his hat.}
<C>__{skull cowboy}
<D>__{howdy}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you look a mess. like an ole cooter dog.}
<A>__{tight shot eric's face streaked with mostly his own blood. another angle the skull cowboy and eric}
<C>__{skull cowboy}
<D>__{getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{go away.}
<C>__{skull cowboy}
<D>__{you need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{shut up.}
<C>__{skull cowboy}
<D>__{maybe i was wrong about you.}
<A>__{the skull cowboy seems saddened or disappointed. all we get is a little shake of his skull head. darla makes a sound and eric turns toward her. she's really confused. she's looking to eric for some kind of answer.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{your daughter is out there, on the street, waiting for you.}
<A>__{she's stunned, utterly speechless. all she can do is look in eric's eyes, try to ponder the phantoms there.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{go. now.}
<A>__{darla shoves helter skelter past eric and out the door without a glance back at funboy. eric, recovering, follows slowly, staring at the open door, stooping to lift the guitar dropped during the fight with funboy. the skull cowboy has vanished. push in. grimly, eric takes a syringe and begins to draw blood from the late funboy.}
