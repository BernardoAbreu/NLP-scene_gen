<L>__{interior landing day}
<A>__{julia climbs the stairs, her face charged with suppressed feeling. she's sick of larry; his enthusiasm depresses her, his compromises anger her. what's between them is stale, like this house.}
<L>__{interior torture room day}
<A>__{the door opens a fraction.}
<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{larry has stepped into the kitchen, to find the remains of the food we briefly glimpsed in the titles sequence, now rotted and fungal. it smells, to judge the expression on his face. it also puzzles him. then, from above:}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{larry!}
<A>__{he leaves the kitchen and retraces his steps to the bottom of the stairs.}
<D>__{larry!}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i hear you.}
<A>__{he starts up the stairs.}
<L>__{interior lower landing day}
<A>__{larry reaches the top of the stairs.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{where are you?}
<C>__{julia}
<P>__{(out of sight)}
<D>__{in here.}
<A>__{larry follows julia's voice to the end of the corridor. julia is standing in a doorway. beyond, the 'bedroom' we saw in the titles sequence, untouched since then.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{squatters?}
<A>__{larry steps past her, and throws back the blankets. wood lice scurry away. he goes to the suitcase, and starts looking through it. besides clothes there's a lot else that speaks of its owner: bric a brac picked up in a lifetime of adventuring; handful of bullets; fragments of an erotic statue; coins and notes from a dozen countries. amongst the stuff, some photographs. larry peers at them. one pictures a good looking intense man in his mid to late thirties, in bed with a naked chinese girl.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{frank.}
<A>__{at the door, we see julia almost flinch at the name.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{he's here?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{he's been here. there's stuff in the kitchen. he must have made a hasty exit.}
<A>__{the 'phone rings downstairs. julia jumps.}
<D>__{that'll be kirsty.}
<A>__{larry stands up and leaves the room, moving past julia in the doorway, who is left to stare down at the bed frank has slept in, and the suitcase of belongings. as we hear larry clatter downstairs it seems julia's face is close to tears.}
