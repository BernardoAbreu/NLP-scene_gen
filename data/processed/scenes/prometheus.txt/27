<L>__{interior scientists' workroom day}
<A>__{holloway and watts set up their workspace a central display table and huge display surfaces on the walls. fascinating documents slide under their fingertips: an engineer alphabet. ancient art. climate and genetic data. david appears in the doorway.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{david. i wondered when we'd see you.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i trust your database is in order. i set it up myself.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{all's well, i think.}
<A>__{david turns to go. hesitates in the doorway.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i should tell you: the time you spent sleeping, i spent studying your research.}
<A>__{holloway and watts look at the android, his words sinking in.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{you studied our work for two and a half years.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's quite a data set.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{so you've seen everything. well. what do you think?}
<A>__{david glances over the documents displayed around the room.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{your hypothesis is...bold. the audacity of it. your climate data's undeniable: the holocene epoch was engineered. dr. watts, your genetic studies are equally conclusive. pulses of cultural change are harder to prove, but even there your case is strong. i believe in your "engineers."}
<C>__{break room}
<A>__{a utilitarian sitting room. steel benches and table bolted to the deck. seated here are two weyland industries technicians: andrew chance, 50, a stocky computer engineer with a genial bearing and a bristling salt and pepper mustache. mona ravel, 45, a dour, rangy woman with a plain face, her hair pulled severely back. a physicist and chemist. they wear black weyland industries jackets. they radiate intelligence and competence. these are pros. david leads holloway and watts past the break room. holloway spots the technicians. strides in to greet them.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{weyland industries! mr. chance. ms. ravel. you remember dr. watts.}
<A>__{watts and the technicians exchange greetings.}
<C>__{holloway }
<D>__{about the materials i gave you. some of the technical aspects...}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{we'll handle our end of the job.}
<C>__{ravel}
<D>__{if there is a job.}
<A>__{holloway blinks at her. chance explains, not unkindly:}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{we only have a job if you find something.}
<C>__{corridor}
<A>__{holloway and watts follow the imperturbable david down a steel corridor to vickers's cabin door.}
<C>__{vickers's suite}
<A>__{an open plan cabin like an urban loft apartment. watts and holloway follow david inside. vickers rises to meet them. the walls are industrial steel but the floors are lushly carpeted, the furniture opulent. a king sized bed, a mahogany desk, a dining table. gleaming machines ensure vickers never need step outside: a private hypersleep freezer, an autokitchen, a medical pod.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{is that a pauling medical pod? there's only ten of those things on earth! i guess nine, now.}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{i told mr. weyland i wouldn't compromise my standard of living. he accommodated me.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{i know, i had to cut my manifest. this used to be the number four cargo bay.}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{what can i do for you, professor?}
<A>__{holloway gestures with the slate he's brought with him.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{we're about to reach the system periphery. i thought you'd want to see the search protocols we }
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{no. i was set to be the next ceo of weyland industries. then you came along and sold mr. weyland on...this. so here i am. out of the running. i will go where i'm told. but don't ask me to play along.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{but when you get back...}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{i will be five years behind the curve. out of touch. over.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{you might make the discovery of the ages.}
<A>__{vickers looks at him as if she's dealing with a child.}
<C>__{holloway }
<D>__{you don't believe in what we're doing.}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{mr. weyland believes. that's enough.}
<A>__{she walks them toward the door. interview's over.}
<C>__{vickers }
<D>__{now we're out of communication, you can tell the crew what we're doing.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{they don't know? they volunteered.}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{they volunteered blind. classified job, triple pay.}
<C>__{cargo bay}
<A>__{the crew brick, glasse, stillwell, downs, and kamarov sit on crates in an improvised lecture hall. holloway and watts in front of them. janek at the back of the room. a hologram shows ancient images of divine visitations. the crew is visibly spooked.}
<C>__{downs}
<D>__{aliens.}
<C>__{glasse}
<D>__{you shitting me?}
<A>__{stillwell is staring at the frightening images: gods and titans towering over mortals.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{i think all our mythologies are race memories of the engineers. horus the sun god. prometheus bringing fire from heaven. a pillar of fire, a pillar of smoke. the engineers are the gods.}
<A>__{kamarov stiffens, smelling blasphemy.}
<C>__{kamarov}
<D>__{the mythology gods maybe. god is god.}
<C>__{stillwell}
<D>__{kamarov. let him talk.}
<A>__{stillwell's staring unhappily at the ancient images: gods towering over mortals, inhuman and terrifying.}
<C>__{stillwell }
<D>__{so we're going to meet these things?}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{we probably won't meet anyone. you'd expect a star traveling race to generate radio or laser signals. fusion drives and gravity drives have clear signatures. but zeta two reticuli is silent. and the engineers have gone missing on earth.}
<C>__{watts }
<D>__{by the pattern, they should've come to earth seventeen centuries ago. and again six centuries ago. but no sign. after twelve thousand years...they stopped coming.}
<C>__{brick}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{exactly. why?}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{"my god, my god, why have you forsaken me?"}
<A>__{they turn. janek grins at holloway across the cargo bay.}
<C>__{janek }
<D>__{is that the question you've come light years to answer?}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{only my first question. i have many.}
