<A>__{psych. patients fill a cavernous day room engaged in arts and crafts. some of the sadder patients stare off into space as jean crosses the room. he carries a plate of cookies and a full glass of milk. he approaches a sad, nice looking, middle aged black woman the same one from the dream, earlier. she sits alone fondling a pillow in her lap. it's his mother, matilde. she doesn't see him coming. as he sets the plate in front of her, she notices him. she recognizes him and seems pleased, even in her isolation. he kisses her on the cheek.}
