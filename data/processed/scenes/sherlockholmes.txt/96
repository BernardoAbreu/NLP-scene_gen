<T>__{or alt:}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{to watch a lady undress without her permission is a criminal offense, sherlock, and could get you into a lot of trouble...}
<A>__{they both eye the derringer on the table.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{so why don't you come over here and help me instead.}
<A>__{holmes approaches her somewhat tentatively and reaches for the top button on the back of her dress.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{that's better.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you can stop looking for reardon.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{i knew i could count on you.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{he was buried in blackwood's tomb.}
<A>__{irene is momentarily taken aback then recovers.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{wonderful. case closed then. your services are no longer required.}
<A>__{unbuttoning done, holmes steps out to confront irene.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i can't help wondering if your employer will be as content with these results? you were uncharacteristically ill at ease in his presence. your hand was trembling, your gaze was averted. i couldn't see his face, but i spotted chalk on his lapel. a professor perhaps?}
<A>__{irene gets up, walks behind a dressing screen.}
<C>__{irene}
<P>__{(behind screen)}
<D>__{the eye patch was a nice touch.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{but i've never known a professor to carry a gun, and on such a clever contraption.}
<C>__{irene }
<D>__{let's not argue.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{we're not.}
<A>__{irene steps out, now wearing an array of victorian undergarments. unfairly gorgeous. the huge diamond still around her neck. she moves back to the dressing table. holmes won't look at her, refusing to get turned on.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{tell me who you're working for and what he's after.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{that's nobody's business but my own.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i disagree.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{you see, we are arguing.}
<A>__{holmes gets closer and closer to irene as he presses his case vehemently.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{when a man you ask me to find ends up dead in the coffin of the most notorious murderer since jack the ripper and that murderer manages to return from the dead, not only is it my business, it's the business of scotland yard and the highest levels of the british government. they will certainly consider your reticence to be an obstruction of justice. which in relation to a crime of this magnitude would certainly mean prison time.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{this wine is excellent. you should really try some.}
<A>__{holmes notices her derringer on the table next to the wine bottle.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{so what's it to be?}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{do we really have to decide now?}
<A>__{irene reaches for the wine.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you're in over your head this time, irene.}
<A>__{irene snatches up her gun. holmes grabs her arm. bang! a bullet tears into his shoe, missing his toe. holmes snatches away the smoking derringer. irene kisses him, hard and angry at first, becoming something else. another of the weapons in her arsenal, and the one that disarms holmes. the kiss leads them to the bed.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{that's better.}
<A>__{irene pulls him down to it. he doesn't resist. click! holmes' eyes flare with surprise. click!}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{much better.}
<A>__{irene has handcuffed him to the bed frame.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{this is the only way it could ever work between us, sherlock one in shackles, the other with the key.}
<A>__{she gets off him. while he struggles on the bed, irene walks casually across the room. she starts putting on man's clothing. she's in charge now.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{i've never been in over my head.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{how can you live like this always a fugitive.}
<A>__{she approaches, now dressed as a man, straddles him.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{but free. and on my own terms. just like you well, not you at this exact moment }
<A>__{she pulls at the front of his trousers, throws the handcuff keys down there.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{ but generally speaking.}
<A>__{holmes has no retort. irene takes the scarf off his neck, moves to the doorway.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{if anyone asks, please let them know that mr. o'neil didn't have time to check out.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i hope you don't mind settling the bill.}
