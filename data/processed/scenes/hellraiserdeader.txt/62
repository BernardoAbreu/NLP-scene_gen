<L>__{interior subway tunnel night}
<A>__{a strange twisting tunnel with eerie blue lights. pipes running along the ceiling, dripping water and hissing steam. amy and marla march quickly towards camera.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{marla what... what happened to you?}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{i put my head through a noose and i jumped ten feet down. they cut me down, and winter breathed into me, and i was alive. and everybody was happy... and like, congratulating me...}
<A>__{marla's eyes are wet with yellowish tears.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{and for a while, it was great. but it's like being a tightrope walker... you're walking along on this rope, and then all of a sudden, it's like you realize i'm walking on a rope a hundred feet up in the air. and that's when you fall.}
<P>__{( struggles to control herself)}
<D>__{i tried to end it. that's when you found me.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{why are you doing this? why am i here?}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{for the reward from it all.}
<A>__{the tunnel starts to take some weird twists and turns. they stop and marla turns amy in her direction. the place starts to tremble, a train is approaching from far off.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{but it isn't enough for somebody else to stick a knife into you. you have to come to the point where you can do it to yourself that's the acceptance. the final preparation before you give your soul to it. willingly.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{but why? what it is all for?}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{that's the missing link. that part he keeps to himself. but he promises an eternal paradise filled with the ultimate pleasures. we just can't be afraid. and we can't have any doubts.}
<P>__{(introspective)}
<D>__{guess i screwed up on that part.}
<A>__{the tunnel is narrowing, the train is right around the bend. amy turns to the sound of the rumbling train.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{fear is where you go to learn.}
<A>__{amy spins back to her. "huh?"}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{sorry. i told you there's no turning back amy. only he can bring you back.}
<A>__{amy's attention is on the train, it roars in at full throttle.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{amy!}
<A>__{amy turns around just as the train is about to run through them to find winter, arms open for her.}
<C>__{winter}
<P>__{(screaming over the train)}
<D>__{all roads lead home.}
