<A>__{close on the face: columbus is stretched on a bed, sweating heavily in fever, clearly delirious. insects crawl over his face, he makes no effort to swat them away. there is a dripping sound of water.}

<A>__{rain is falling into the room over documents spread on a table. columbus stands up and moves to the table. some of the walls have been blackened with smoke and flames. a lizard scuttles into the shadows.}

<D>__{"and those who are enlightened before the others are condemned to purse that light in spite of others..."}
<A>__{columbus stares down at the documents, moving them away from the rain drips. he stares out by the window, and we see: a devastated landscape. flooded roads, half destroyed huts, broken trees... a dog picks its way through the mud.}
