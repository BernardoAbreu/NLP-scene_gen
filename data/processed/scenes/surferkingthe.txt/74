<T>__{fade to black:}
<L>__{exterior early evening surfs wave pool}
<A>__{grounds kids are stacking chairs in preparation for final closing. tarps are being thrown over everything and tied down. awnings are being taken down. chairs and tables are being moved. we see jaffa packing up his cd's into that cardboard box. he also snaps the winter covers for the sound equipment into place.}
<L>__{exterior moments later evening time out shack}
<A>__{a banner hangs over the time shack, "thanks for another great year". alex, robbie, katie and amy are clocking out for the final time this summer. they all stop and look around one final time. suddenly tiffany drives up in her convertible.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{another summer gone. how about it robbie? you gonna guard next year? they could use your help.}
<A>__{they all walk closer to her car.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i don't know...we have a pretty good time at aokee's.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{you know, that's what i hear. maybe i should work there next summer.}
<A>__{alex, robbie, katie and amy all say these lines pretty much at the same time.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{you wouldn't like it...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{that's a bad idea...}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{and you're such a good guard...}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{you'd be miserable...}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{maybe you're right. see you around...}
<A>__{eddie appears out of the time shack wearing his tuxedo t shirt.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(almost singing)}
<D>__{tiffany!}
<A>__{he walks up to her driver's side.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<P>__{(feeling charitable, warmly)}
<D>__{hello, eddie.}
<A>__{eddie shows there is nothing in his hands, then reaches into the car and from behind tiffany's ear pulls a plastic easter egg out. he hands it to her, and she opens it. a beautiful butterfly flies out and away. she is momentarily entranced.}
<C>__{tiffany }
<D>__{you know, that's one of the most beautiful things i've ever seen.}
<P>__{(pause, thinking, what the heck)}
<D>__{hop in eddie, let me give you a ride home.}
<A>__{eddie waves his hand for her to scoot over so he can drive. she is surprised, but does, almost reflexively. he gets in and he looks at alex, robbie, katie and amy grinning broadly as he pulls away. alex, robbie, katie and amy just watch in stunned silence as eddie and tiffany drive off.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(collecting himself)}
<D>__{well. just another summer at water world.}
<A>__{the group begins walking toward the exit gate, as we go wide and helicopter upward. they get smaller and smaller in the shot as we hear the conversation continue.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{you know katie, i really am sorry i was such a jerk this summer.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{we'll be going to the same high school. you'll have plenty of chances to make it up to me. let's see, there's homecoming, the christmas dance, valentines day...and of course, the prom...}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{alex?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i'm gonna need to borrow twenty bucks.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{yep.}
<A>__{we helicopter up for a final shot over the whole park.}
<C>__{the end}
