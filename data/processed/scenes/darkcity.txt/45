<A>__{white stops, nowhere left to go, just a long drop to the street through a series of arched windows. a low, raftered room, three huge black bells. suddenly a groan of gears in the ceiling and the bells start to swing, build momentum. clang! cla a a ang! a cacophony of noise. white puts his hands over his ears in pain, then turns to the stairs.}

<A>__{the men stop. so does white. they separate, now approaching him from opposite sides, moving around the bells. white doesnit know who to point the gun at he swings back and forth, one to the other, faster and faster, as the men approach. he lets them get uncomfortably close, then swings to his right, thrusts the gun to one manis forehead. fires. the man steps back, spouting liquid from the bullet hole, hits a low railing, falls into the shaft at the centre of the tower. the second man swings his dagger at white. white falls backwards, dropping his gun clumsily. the man advances, smiling kicks the gun across the wooden floor. white, clutching at straws, lifts his foot, kicks down hard on a loose floorboard. the board flies up, pivoting against whiteis heel, catches the mystery man with a crack under the chin. white runs at the off balance man, head butts him in the stomach. the man recoils, canit stop, steps off backwards into space, plummets into darkness towards the street below. white relieved, turns, dusts himself, picks up his gun. looks down at the floor. broken glass and capsules everywhere he dropped the bottle of pills during the scuffle. starts to pick them up. behind him something is rising. the shadowy mystery man is levitating himself back up to the bell tower. he lands behind white, approaches, lifting his dagger, closer and closer. white glances around. the man lunges, pushing white towards the shaft beneath the swinging bells. white falls, dangles over dark space, the man stands above him.}

<A>__{suddenly, to whiteis amazement, the shiny black rim of a bell clips the manis head. slams it against a low wooden beam in the ceiling. a splash of black liquid. the man slumps to the ground, his head crushed beyond recognition. white pulls himself up stands over the manis body, trying to decide what to do. a movement catches his eye. tight on the collapsed manis ear something moves inside. a black insect, half dead, crawls out of his crushed head. white revolted, squashes the insect under his shoe.}
