<D>__{looks like a damn graveyard round here.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{yeah. but just where the hell has it been?}
<A>__{they step up to the front of the building.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{damn. that is the ugliest building i have ever seen.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{naw. i think it's... i dunno. something about it just buzzes me.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{that would be the after effects of that reticular inseminoid encounter you had.}
<A>__{patrick opens the door and steps inside.}

<D>__{welcome to the ill zone.}
