<L>__{interior trauma room hospital}
<A>__{handcuffs lock richards to his bed. richards is hooked up to an iv and a tube's up his nose. a heart rate monitor chimes rhythmically. two uniformed officers look on as conners and dekker enter.}
<C>__{conners}
<P>__{(to the officers)}
<D>__{take five, guys.}
<A>__{the officers exit. conners locks the door, walks to the bed, leans over richards.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{hiya, damon. how you feeling?}
<C>__{dekker}
<P>__{(taps conners)}
<D>__{may i?}
<A>__{conners concedes the floor. dekker addresses richards.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{you remember me, don't you?}
<P>__{(damon gives an evil glare)}
<D>__{thought so.}
<A>__{dekker turns his attention to richards' iv, the tubes which carry medication into his body. from a nearby medicine cabinet, dekker rummages around.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{i was skiing about three years ago. aspen. beautiful country. ever been? never mind. i hit a mogul, landed on a sheet of ice and slammed into a tree. broke myself up pretty bad. kinda like you did today. i was in a hospital bed for three months. had it not been for... here it is.}
<P>__{(he finds)}
<D>__{morphine. without this stuff, i wouldn't have made it.}
<A>__{dekker fills a syringe with the entire bottle.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{now this iv drip administers a small dosage every minute. makes you feel relaxed and calm. no pain. but...}
<A>__{dekker sticks the syringe needle tip into the iv bag.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{if i were to inject this whole thing... that would be all she wrote for damon.}
<C>__{richards}
<D>__{you don't have the balls.}
<A>__{dekker presses down on the syringe, just a little, but enough to go into the bag. richards can't believe it.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{this equipment malfunctions all the time. overdoses are quite common. besides, i don't think the da's going to launch a full scale investigation over a scum like you.}
<A>__{richards attempts to signal for a nurse, but dekker pulls the call button away.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{you don't have to tell us a damn thing. plead the fifth... roll the dice.}
<A>__{dekker squeezes in some more, until... richards gives in, signals that he'll talk.}
