<L>__{255 grain wadcutter and 147 grain fmj flatnose ammunition. he loads}
<A>__{up, goes after jonathan, who's no longer in sight. pendergast passes down a long, sloping hallway into cavernous blackness ahead. at the bottom pendergast stops. he has to stoop down as he goes through an archway and into...}
<B>__{a vast arching room...}
<A>__{a dark stream of water runs between concrete walls with tunnels going off from all sides. it appears to be part of the sewer system. the dog cowers in a corner. jonathan moves to his side.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{look. it's hobbes! he's all right.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{come on. let's get back to the others. we can't leave them alone.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{it's alright. i can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone. what is this place?}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{not on the map. looks like it connects with the city sewer.}
<A>__{pendergast calls back down the tunnel for the deputies.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{we're coming back!}
<A>__{the words go unanswered. from the hall comes a loud report. it's the shotguns, blasting desperately. something flies up all around them as the sound echoes. bats! pendergast and jonathan shield themselves from the flurry of beating wings. finally the animals settle and pendergast and jonathan exchange a look. the silence is filled by a soft rumbling sound. they stand together, waiting. pendergast points his gun at the hall leading back to the deputies. a ridge of hair on the dog's back rises and it growls.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{identify yourself! who's there?}
<A>__{no answer. the rumbling continues, growing louder. then a dark object appears. it comes rolling out of the hallway, bounces in front of them and stops. pendergast shines his light on... deputy one's head! the mouth is open wide in terror. across the cheek is a vicious claw mark.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{oh... my... god!}
<C>__{pendergast}
<P>__{(hisses)}
<D>__{quiet.}
<A>__{and now they hear a gut wrenching shriek that's abruptly cut off, followed by a second rumbling sound! jonathan grabs pendergast by the shirt, panicked.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{stay calm.}
<A>__{they head quietly for the exit at the other end of room which seems to slope up. after they're gone a few moments the head of deputy two rolls to a stop.}
