<A>__{randy rounds a corner. he enters the computer room continuous the screens show the children's contour images, again. where's milo? randy takes a seat at the same console milo was at, and begins to type. camera booms slowly down beneath table level to find: milo hanging onto the underside of the table, knuckles white, as he clings to metal table braces. the toes of his sneakers are jammed into the space between a black plastic data tower and the table bottom. randy shifts in his seat, his knee rising toward milo's back. milo arches it, avoids a knee by mere millimeters. randy: brings up a shot of a programmer at work, zooms in on his screen to begin collecting his code. milo: begins to lose his grip as sweat forms on his brow and, worse, on his hands. they're giving way. randy: clicks. a printer across the room start making a hard copy of the purloined code. milo: stares in horror as the data tower his toes are jammed on top of starts to shift threatening to disengage from its ports. he tries to lift it back up with heels of his shoes. randy: knits his brow as his screen flickers. he keeps typing, but starts to lower his head: he's going to look under the table. milo: winces as he presses the tower upward with his heels, while trying to maintain his balance... randy: lowering his head, keeps his eyes on the screen, hits keys. just as he is about to clear the level of the table the screen re illumines. he comes back up. milo: having extended his legs to support the tower, feels his hands slipping... randy: closes up the window... milo: flops to the carpet(!) just as randy pushes away from the table... from the floor milo watches him walk over to the printer, collect his hardcopy, and disappear from view. milo listens: the door clicks shut, the whistling recedes. back room a moment later milo traces randy's steps. he sees the door with the civil defense sticker, intuits how randy got here, i.e, how one moves, unobserved, between the day care and #20. he sags against the wall. wondering what to do, now.}
