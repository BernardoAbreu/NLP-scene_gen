<A>__{we are in the basement now. at the end of the hall is a steel door, with perhaps, just the faintest hint of music heard coming from beyond. raquel knocks. a "peep hole" slat opens and a black light shines into raquel's eyes. a voice behind the door offers a verbal challenge, speaking a language we've never heard, laced with a devilish cadence. raquel responds in kind. the door opens. raquel gives dennis a knowing wink, enters. dennis follows.}

<B>__{something big}
<A>__{rising up behind him. in a flash, blade swings his sword downward, cutting off the vampire's right hand at the elbow. the severed limb falls to the floor but it doesn't slow the hulking creature down. it slams into blade. blade flies backwards thirty feet, tumbling over tables, slamming into the rear wall so hard that plaster rains down from the ceiling. blade suddenly finds himself wrestling with a feral faced six foot something nightmare named quinn. the vampire rears back its head, jaws stretching wide. every inch of his face is covered with ritual scarification patterns and maori like tribal tattoos. blade forces an elbow against quinn's throat, trying to keep him at bay. with his other hand he reaches to his bandoleer, pulls out a stake crunch! blade shoves the stake through the vampire's larynx. quinn gurgles, clutches at his throat. blade rolls out from under, unholsters the cross bow secured to his leg. with a flick of a switch the arms of the bow snap! open, drawing the bow string taut. blade fires the bolt hits quinn in the shoulder, throwing him backwards and nailing him to the wall. as quinn reaches over with his other hand to pull out the stake blade fires again. a second bolt slams into quinn's other arm, effectively pinning him like a butterfly to a board. up above, mounted in one of the corners, is a security camera. blade fires a cross bow bolt straight into the lens. blade strides over, placing his sword against quinn's chest.}

<C>__{whistler}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{which is why you're here. we could use someone with your experience.}
<A>__{a beat passes between them and karen knows where she stands now. in for a penny, in for a pound. whistler reaches for blade's sword.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{this used to be mine, you know. it's been passed down through the centuries, from one hunter to the next }
<A>__{whistler extends the sword, sighting down the length of it. he takes a few practice parries it's obvious he used to be quite skilled in the art of swordsmanship.}

<D>__{why do you hunt them?}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{habit, mostly, just like this.}

<C>__{karen}
<D>__{he killed them?}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{eventually. he toyed with them first. he made me choose, do you understand? which order they would die in }

<C>__{karen}
<D>__{how did you escape?}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{i didn't. he was cruel enough to let me live.}
<P>__{(slapping his brace)}
<D>__{even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.}

<C>__{karen}

<D>__{frost's bodycount keeps rising, and i'm not getting any younger, am i?}
<A>__{just then, we hear a scream come from blade's room, sounding more like the cry of a beast than a man. karen takes a step towards blade's room }
<C>__{whistler}

<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{can you imagine what a dash of that would do on your sword?}
<A>__{whistler claps his hand on karen's shoulder in approval, then limps away, quickly busying himself with another project. blade moves to follow, but karen stops him }

<A>__{a bell atop the door jingles, announcing blade's arrival. we're in a dusty, cave like room filled with baskets and bottle lined shelves featuring things like "toad spleen extract" and "barking deer wine". joss sticks burn, sending wispy tendrils of incense into the air. at the back of the shop, an elderly chinese man in a cardigan sits in front of a battered television, watching a boxing match. he's eating a bowl of litchi fruit. on the counter nearby, a spider monkey watches attentively.}

<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{how can you be out here?}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{i dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. we've developed a type of sun blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things.}
<A>__{on closer examination we see that frost is wearing a translucent lotion on his face. he touches a finger to his cheek, rubs some of the lotion between his fingers.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{it's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. the goal, of course, is to be like you, "the day walker".}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{i don't buy it.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{why not? the future of our race runs through your bloodstream. you've got the best of both worlds, blade. all of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.}

<D>__{maybe i don't see it that way.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? spare me the uncle tom routine. you can't keep denying what you are. you're one of us, blade. you always have been.}

<D>__{you're wrong.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{am i? you think the humans will ever accept a half breed like you? they can't. they're afraid of you.}

<D>__{how?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{with a retrovirus. it's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's dna to mutate. they've been using them to treat sickle cell anemia.}
