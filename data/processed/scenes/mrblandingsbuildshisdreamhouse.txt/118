<T>__{dissolve:}
<L>__{exterior the house late afternoon}
<A>__{the moving vans are driving away.}
<L>__{interior the foyer late afternoon}
<A>__{a general flurry of activity; gussie and several workmen carrying furniture upstairs, unpacking barrels, etc. muriel, list and samples in hand, is explaining her color scheme to mr. pedelford, a polite, cigar smoking, noncommittal boss painter. in the b.g., casually leaning on the bannister is pedelford's taciturn and somewhat skeptical looking assistant.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{now i want the living room to be a soft green.}
<P>__{(pedelford nods)}
<D>__{not quite as bluish as a robin's egg, but yet not as yellow as daffodil buds.}
<C>__{pedelford}
<D>__{mm.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(handing him a sample)}
<D>__{the best sample i could get is a little too yellow, but don't let whoever mixes it go to the other extreme and get it too blue. it should just be sort of a grayish yellow green.}
<C>__{pedelford}
<P>__{(making a note)}
<D>__{mm hmm.}
<A>__{they turn to the dining room.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{now the dining room i'd like yellow. not just yellow, a very gay yellow.}
<C>__{pedelford}
<D>__{mm hmm.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{something bright and sunshiny.}
<P>__{(sudden inspiration)}
<D>__{i tell you, mr. pedelford, if you'll just send one of your workmen to the a&p for a pound of their best butter and match it exactly, you can't go wrong.}
<C>__{pedelford}
<P>__{(making a note)}
<D>__{mm.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{this is the paper we're going to use here in the foyer.}
<P>__{(hands sample to him)}
<D>__{it's flowered but i don't want the ceiling to match any of the colors of the flowers. there are some little dots in the background, and it's these dots i want you to match. not the little greenish dots near the hollyhock leaf, but the little bluish dot between the rosebud and the delphinium blossom. is that clear?}
<A>__{pedelford looks carefully at the sample, then:}
<C>__{pedelford}
<P>__{(making note)}
<D>__{mm hmm.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{the kitchen's to be white. not a cold, antiseptic hospital white a little warmer but not to suggest any other color but white.}
<C>__{pedelford}
<P>__{(note)}
<D>__{mm.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{now for the powder room, i want you to match this thread.}
<P>__{(hands him thread)}
<D>__{you can see it's practically an apple red. somewhere between a healthy winesap and an unripened jonathan.}
<C>__{pedelford}
<P>__{(making note)}
<D>__{mm.}
<A>__{there is a crash from the kitchen.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{will you excuse me?}
<A>__{muriel hastily exits toward the kitchen. pedelford turns to his assistant.}
<C>__{pedelford}
<D>__{got it, charlie?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(deadpan; indicating rooms with his thumb)}
<D>__{green, yellow, blue, white, red.}
<C>__{pedelford}
<D>__{check.}
