<A>__{where the towering windmill once stood is now only a crater about 5 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter, with charred bits of wood and metal strewn everywhere. ground water spurts from the broken well seal... and a cantaloupe sized meteorite sits in the center of the crater. two firemen haul out the meteorite with gloved hands as sam and o'dell arrive on the scene. corey is already there looking on, as well as chris holt, who gave them a ride into town, phil coulter from the motel, and other local citizens. frank haley (54), the farmer who owns the land, is fuming.}

<D>__{you know how much it's gonna cost me to replace this goddamn windmill?}
<A>__{officer o'dell steps up beside him and kicks the meteorite with his boot.}

<D>__{ya think?}
<A>__{sam looks down at a can of food on the ground amidst some scorched clothing. o'dell takes note of some other canned goods and scraps of tarp.}

<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that whack job tom's been squattin' up there the last couple a' months. thinks he's the goddamn town watchman...}

<D>__{you think he got blown up?}
<A>__{everyone scans the ground for signs of human remains until phil pipes up:}

<D>__{i saw him out in front of the motel early this morning, alive and well.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{oh, well, thank heavens...}
<A>__{sam turns and peers up at the water tank. it's marred by burn marks and dents from the explosion. as she tilts her head and looks closer, she can almost pick out a shape created by the damage a negative image like the shroud of turin... ...in the form of a bizarre, toothy grinned face of a giant}
