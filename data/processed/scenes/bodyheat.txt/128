<A>__{edmund has stopped at the top of the stairs. he listens for sounds from below. he starts down the steps in the dark.}
<L>__{interior stairwell night}
<A>__{edmund comes slowly down the steps, his gun pointing here, then there in his perfectly steady grip. the thrill of the hunt is in edmund's eyes. the downstairs is thick with ominous shadows. at the bottom of the steps, he stops and listens again. he moves in two quick steps to the entry hall and looks into the living room and dining room. he seems to hear something at the rear of the house. he turns and moves back along the central hall, very slowly. the alcove under the stairs is pitch black. edmund points his gun at that approaching space and stops. he listens. the tinkling of the wind chimes rises weirdly, making it hard for him to hear.}

<A>__{edmund's hand reaches out to the wall. his fingers find the light switch. he flips it. for a second, we are blinded by the glare. in the next instant, as we see that the space below the stairs is empty, matty screams from the top of the stairs }
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{he has a gun!}
<A>__{edmund thinks she is warning him. he spins to look.}
<C>__{walker}
<D>__{where?}
<A>__{suddenly, racine bursts from the hall closet, the wooden plank raised above his head. he brings it down fast toward edmund's head. edmund reacts instinctively, raising his arm, the arm that holds the gun, to protect himself. the wooden plank smashes down half its force taken by edmund's forearm, half by his head. the gun blasts once. one small window in the front door shatters and the bullet continues into the night. edmund's revolver slides across the hall floor into a corner. edmund is on the floor, blood pouring from his scalp. but he is coming on like a crazed beast. his glasses askew, but still on his head, he has grasped racine around the legs. with a powerful lunge, he pulls racine's legs out. racine crashes to the hall floor, losing the wooden plank. matty, frozen at the stair railing, cries out. edmund is pulling racine toward him with all his might, crawling up racine's body as they both slide on the wood floor. edmund reaches out one huge hand, and pulls racine even closer. racine puts his left hand into edmund's face, his thumb flat against the lens of edmund's glasses and pushes his head back. the glasses fly away and racine loses his hold. edmund comes on. racine's right hand gropes gropes finds the wooden plank. he swings it up. the wooden plank describes a perfect arc into our view, and then out, finding its mark with a horrible thud. matty, up the stairs, turns away. racine falls back on the floor.}
