<C>__{final draft}
<D>__{march 16, 1994}
<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior space (vfx i)}
<A>__{a vast and sparkling starfield. a pinpoint of light appears and starts moving toward the camera... a small and distant cylindrical object tumbling end over end, but we can't determine exactly what it is yet...}
<L>__{exterior wheatfield day}
<A>__{a vast and undulating sea of wheat. we become aware that there are two heads sticking out of the stalks of wheat: two men are standing and looking up at the sky. as we move towards them, we begin to hear their conversation...and we can see that the two men are scotty and chekov, dressed in civilian clothing.}
<C>__{chekov}
<P>__{(points to sky)}
<D>__{there he is there, to the south!}
<C>__{scotty}
<P>__{(peers upward)}
<D>__{what are ye, blind? that's a bird.}
<A>__{as they stare up at the sky...}
<L>__{exterior space (vfx i)}
<A>__{the cylinder tumbling through space is now closer, and we can now see that it is a bottle of some sort, and it is tumbling directly toward the camera...}
<L>__{exterior wheatfield day}
<A>__{as before, chekov and scotty staring at the sky.}
<C>__{scotty}
<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{repelling the crystalline trench... rafting down lava flows... orbital skydiving. it's like the man is running a bloody decathlon across the galaxy.}
<A>__{suddenly we hear a double sonic boom.}
<C>__{chekov}
<P>__{(re: sound)}
<D>__{that should be him now. i think he's just crossed the sound barrier.}
<A>__{they shield their eyes against the sun and look up.}
<L>__{exterior space (vfx i)}
<A>__{the bottle gets closer...}
<L>__{exterior wheatfield day}
<A>__{a man in a high tech body harness and parachute lands in the wheat flat on his back. his body suit is charred, scorched, wisps of smoke still curling off of it. there are small thrusters attached to his backpack and boots. scotty and chekov move to him. the man removes his helmet. revealing that it is kirk. he smiles broadly, like a child who has just come off a roller coaster.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{right on target! i jump out over the arabian peninsula... and i end up here, right on the dime.}
<A>__{kirk gets to his feet.}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{actually, captain, your precise target area was thirty five meters...}
<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{that way.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{thanks for pointing that out.}
<A>__{kirk starts to pull off his suit, reacts to a sudden pain in his back.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh...}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{i've warned ye about that back of yours. you should have a doctor take a look at it.}
<A>__{kirk waves him away, and continues to remove his harness.}
<L>__{exterior space (vfx i)}
<A>__{the tumbling bottle rushes past, and we can now see that it is a champagne bottle dom perignon, 2265. follow the bottle as it tumbles through space...}
<L>__{exterior wheatfield day}
<A>__{kirk, scotty and chekov as before.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{tomorrow i want to make a tri elliptical jump. that's where you jump out over northern china, and make three complete orbits before you start re entry...}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{captain. perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.}
<A>__{this strikes a nerve with kirk we see a flash of hesitation and irritation cross his face.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i'm not going.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{scotty, help me with this chute.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{what do you mean, you're not going? we promised.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{when i retired, i swore i'd never set foot on a starship again, and i meant it.}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{captain...}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(firm)}
<D>__{i don't want to hear anymore about it. i'm not going, and that's final.}
<L>__{exterior space (vfx i)}
<A>__{the champagne bottle smashes onto the bow of a federation starship(excelsior class) sitting in its dock in orbit around earth.}
<L>__{exterior space (vfx i)}
<A>__{follow the shards of glass from the bottle as they spread over the ship...revealing the name on the hull: u.s.s. enterprise ncc 1701 b.}
<B>__{angle on spacedock window}
<A>__{a large picture window overlooking the starship in its berth. the window is filled with people in starfleet uniforms, applauding the christening of the ship (but we hear nothing).}
<L>__{interior spacedock observation room (vfx i)}
<A>__{the people are still applauding and we can see that they are looking out over the ship in its berth.}
<L>__{exterior space enterprise b in spacedock (vfx i)}
<A>__{the great ship sits in spacedock.}
<L>__{interior enterprise b bridge}
<A>__{close on a set of turbolift doors as they slide open to reveal kirk, scotty and chekov. a bright light shines into their faces and they react. move to reveal that the bright light is coming from a futuristic camera with a small bank of lights attached to it. the camera is a holographic recorder with two lenses and is worn on an operator's head. there are four journalists clustered in front of the turbolift one associated with the camera, the others using padds to make notations. also clustered around the door are the bridge crew of the enterprise b. everyone is applauding as kirk and the others blink under the bright lights and enter the bridge.}
<C>__{journalists}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{captain kirk, how does it feel to be back on the enterprise bridge... captain, can i have a minute... captain scott, do you have any comment on... commander chekov... etc.}
<A>__{captain john harriman pushes through the crowd.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{excuse me, excuse me...there will be plenty of time for questions later...}
<A>__{the journalists edge away, and the cameraman moves to get a good angle.}
<C>__{harriman}
<P>__{(continuing, to all)}
<D>__{i'm captain john harriman. i'd like to welcome you all aboard.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{it's our pleasure.}
<A>__{harriman is young, confident, eager this is his first command and he takes it very seriously.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{i just want you to know how excited we all are to have a group of living legends with us on our maiden voyage.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i remember reading about your missions when i was in grade school.}
<A>__{the original enterprise officers all stop and give him a look. harriman looks a little embarrassed he didn't mean to insult them. but kirk gives him a little smile, lets it roll off.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{well... may we have a look around?}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{please... please.}
<A>__{chekov sees someone in the background, calls out to her.}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{demora!}
<A>__{chekov moves off.}
<C>__{journalist}
<P>__{(breezy)}
<D>__{so, captain... this is the first starship enterprise in thirty years without james t. kirk in command. how do you feel about that?}
<A>__{the journalist has unknowingly touched a nerve. kirk's eyes flash for a moment the longer he's on this bridge, the more he realizes he doesn't feel good about it at all. he tries to shrug it off with a smile.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{just fine. i'm glad to be here to send her on her way...}
<A>__{he tries to move away from the journalist, who dogs him.}
<C>__{journalist}
<D>__{what have you been doing since you retired?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i've been... keeping busy.}
<A>__{at this point, chekov approaches with a young, (mid twenties) attractive, asian female ensign named demora.}
<C>__{chekov}
<P>__{(to kirk)}
<D>__{excuse me, captain. i'd like you to meet the helmsman of the enterprise b. ensign demora sulu captain james kirk.}
<C>__{demora}
<D>__{it's a pleasure to meet you, sir. my father's told me some... interesting stories about you.}
<A>__{kirk is shocked. for a long moment, he stares at her in amazement.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{your father... hikaru sulu is your father?}
<C>__{demora}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{you met her once before, but she was...}
<A>__{chekov holds out his hand and indicates a very short height.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{but that wasn't so long ago... it couldn't have been more than...}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{twelve years, sir.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{yes... well... congratulations, ensign. it wouldn't be the enterprise without a sulu at the helm.}
<C>__{demora}
<D>__{thank you, sir.}
<P>__{(to chekov)}
<D>__{let me show you the new inertial guidance system.}
<A>__{demora and chekov move off and kirk looks after them for a long beat. the expression on his face changes from shock to sadness... something is clearly bothering him. scotty moves over to kirk, with a smile on his face.}
<C>__{scotty}
<P>__{(to kirk)}
<D>__{damn fine ship if you ask me...}
<A>__{but kirk's mind is still on demora. he watches her as she moves to the helmsman's position.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you know, scotty... it amazes me.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{and what would that be, sir?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{sulu. when did he find the time for a family?}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{it's like you always said if something's important enough, you make the time.}
<A>__{kirk nods absently. scotty realizes something...}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{so... that's why you've been running around the galaxy like an eighteen year old. finding retirement a little lonely, are we?}
<A>__{kirk gives him a look.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{with that kind of tact, i'm glad you're an engineer and not a psychiatrist.}
<A>__{harriman interrupts.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{excuse me, gentlemen... if you'll take your seats.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh... of course.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{revealing that three chairs have been neatly arranged to one side. scotty, kirk and chekov all take their seats. the journalists take positions on the opposite side of the bridge. harriman moves to the command chair and the rest of the bridge crew go to their stations.}
<C>__{harriman}
<P>__{(to all)}
<D>__{prepare to leave spacedock. aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{captain kirk, i'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no... no. thank you.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{please, i insist.}
<A>__{all eyes on kirk he has little choice. he stands uncomfortably. there is a moment of anticipation.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(to all)}
<D>__{take us out.}
<A>__{everyone breaks into applause. kirk sits down in acute embarrassment and annoyance.}
<C>__{chekov}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{very good, sir.}
<C>__{scotty}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{brought a tear to my eye.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior space enterprise b (vfx i)}
<A>__{the great ship majestically leaves the dock, and heads out into open space, passing directly overhead.}
<L>__{interior enterprise b bridge}
<A>__{a short time later. harriman turns to his guests.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{well... we've just cleared the asteroid belt. our course will take us out beyond pluto and then back to spacedock. just a quick run around the block.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{if we have time, we'll conduct a few tests of the warp }
<A>__{suddenly the communications console starts to beep. the com officer hits a few commands in response.}
<C>__{com officer}
<P>__{(to harriman)}
<D>__{we're picking up a distress call, captain.}
<A>__{this grabs everyone's attention.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{on speakers.}
<A>__{we hear the voice of a crewmember who sounds panicked and urgent.}
<C>__{com voice}
<P>__{(fritzed)}
<D>__{this is the transport ship lakul. we're caught in some kind of energy distortion. we can't break free... need immediate help... it' tearing us }
<A>__{the voice is drowned out by static. the science officer checks something on his console. the journalist with the holo camera turns on his light and pans it around to capture the action.}
<C>__{science officer}
<D>__{the lakul is one of two ships transporting el aurian refugees to earth.}
<A>__{harriman blinks a couple of times, surprised at this unexpected turn of events. kirk watches him intently. harriman clears his throat, then turns to demora.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{can you locate them?}
<C>__{demora}
<D>__{the ships are bearing at three one zero mark two one five. distance: three light years.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{signal the closest starship. we're in no condition to mount a rescue... we don't even have a full crew aboard.}
<A>__{the navigator checks his console.}
<C>__{navigator}
<D>__{we're the only one in range, sir.}
<A>__{the holo camera light is shined on harriman as he shifts in his seat, hesitant to take the plunge. kirk is drumming his fingers impatiently on his leg. finally, harriman takes a breath and straightens his jacket a bit.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{well, then... i guess it's up to us.}
<P>__{(to demora)}
<D>__{helm, lay in an intercept course and engage at maximum warp.}
<A>__{kirk fidgets in his chair, itching to get in on the action his instincts taking over. scotty shoots him a side long glance.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{is there something wrong with your chair, captain?}
<A>__{kirk gives him a look.}
<L>__{exterior space enterprise b (vfx i)}
<A>__{the ship snaps into warp.}
<L>__{interior enterprise b bridge}
<A>__{a few minutes later. demora is watching her console.}
<C>__{demora}
<D>__{we're within visual range of the energy distortion, captain.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{on screen.}
<A>__{include viewscreen (vfx i) which now shows a huge ribbon of crackling energy directly ahead of the enterprise b. everyone reacts to the bizarre sight.}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{what the hell is that?}
<C>__{demora}
<P>__{(off console)}
<D>__{i've found the transport ships.}
<A>__{include viewscreen (vfx i) the viewscreen now shows two transport ships trapped like insects in the violent torrent of energy. the ships are being buffeted and thrown about by large tendrils of crackling energy.}
<C>__{demora}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{their hulls are starting to buckle under the stress they won't survive much longer.}
<A>__{the ship suddenly shakes. the navigator works his console.}
<C>__{navigator}
<D>__{we're encountering severe gravimetric distortions from the energy ribbon.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{we'll have to keep our distance... we don't want to get pulled in too...}
<A>__{harriman frowns at the screen, trying to figure out what to do. kirk can barely contain himself to him the answer is obvious. he blurts out the answer }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{tractor beam...}
<A>__{scotty quickly elbows him in the side this isn't kirk's ship. kirk shuts up. harriman glances at kirk.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{we don't have a tractor beam.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you left spacedock without a tractor beam?}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{it won't be installed until tuesday.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{ensign sulu... try generating a subspace field around the ships. that might break them free.}
<C>__{demora}
<D>__{aye, sir.}
<A>__{when kirk hears this order, he shakes his head slightly and mouths the word "no" under his breath. he knows that won't work.}
<C>__{demora}
<P>__{(continuing; shakes her head)}
<D>__{there's too much quantum interference, captain.}
<A>__{harriman frowns again, trying to come up with another solution, but it isn't easy it's his first day in command; his ship is under manned and ill prepared. it's a nightmare come true. kirk is itching to get in on this, his fingers digging into the arms of his chair but he restrains himself.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{what about... venting plasma from the warp nacelles? that might disrupt the ribbon's hold on the ships.}
<C>__{navigator}
<D>__{aye, sir.. releasing drive plasma...}
<A>__{a tense beat. harriman glances over at the journalists, then glances over at kirk. kirk gives him a pained smile, trying to be encouraging even though he knows this is not the right course of action.}
<C>__{navigator}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it's not having any effect, sir. i think }
<C>__{demora}
<D>__{sir! the starboard vessel's hull is collapsing }
<A>__{include viewscreen (vfx i) suddenly the right hand ship on the screen is engulfed by a fiery tendril of energy and it explodes. the other ship continues to be thrown about and buffeted. everyone reacts with shock on the bridge.}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{how many people were aboard that ship?}
<C>__{demora}
<D>__{two hundred sixty five.}
<A>__{harriman pales at the sight... seems shell shocked by the destruction of the ship. he's overwhelmed now, at a genuine loss as to what to do nexterior}
<C>__{demora}
<P>__{(urgent)}
<D>__{the lakul's hull integrity is down to twelve percent, sir.}
<A>__{harriman looks over at kirk, who has remained quiet during this entire sequence only through great effort and out of deference to the young captain. this is a delicate moment harriman doesn't want to look incapable, but at the same time, he needs help.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{captain kirk... i would appreciate any... suggestions you might have.}
<A>__{kirk is out of his chair like a cork out of a bottle. he moves down to stand next to harriman.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{first move us within transporter range and beam those people to the enterprise.}
<A>__{harriman looks at him with surprise.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{what about the gravimetric distortions? they'll tear us apart...}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.}
<A>__{kirk gives him a supportive look. harriman buckles down and grimly looks at the image on the screen.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{helm, close to within transporter range.}
<A>__{kirk glances at the cameraman, who's still shining the light on them all.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{and second turn that damned thing off.}
<A>__{the cameraman turns off the light.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior space enterprise b (vfx i)}
<A>__{the ship edges in yet closer to the crackling ribbon. the tendrils from the ribbon lash out at the ship, just missing it.}
<L>__{interior enterprise b bridge}
<A>__{as before.}
<C>__{demora}
<D>__{we're within range, sir.}
<C>__{harriman}
<P>__{(to lieutenant)}
<D>__{beam them directly to sickbay.}
<C>__{chekov}
<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{how big's your medical staff?}
<C>__{harriman}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{the medical staff... doesn't arrive until tuesday.}
<A>__{chekov turns to the two journalists.}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{you and you. you've just become nurses. let's go.}
<A>__{chekov and the journalists exit to the turbolift.}
<C>__{demora}
<D>__{main engineering reports fluctuations in the warp plasma relays.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{by pass the relays and go to auxiliary systems.}
<A>__{the lieutenant is having problems at the aft console.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{sir, i'm having trouble locking onto them. they appear to be... in some sort of... temporal flux.}
<A>__{kirk turns to scotty.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{scotty?}
<A>__{scotty quickly moves to look at the transporter console.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{what the hell...}
<A>__{kirk moves to him.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{their life signs are... are phasing in and out of our space time continuum.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{phasing? to where?}
<A>__{scotty begins to work.}
<C>__{navigator}
<D>__{sir! their hull's collapsing!}
<L>__{exterior space the lakul (vfx i)}
<A>__{the ship is destroyed by an energy tendril.}
<L>__{interior enterprise b bridge}
<A>__{all eyes on scotty.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{i got forty seven of them...}
<P>__{(beat, grim)}
<D>__{... out of one hundred fifty.}
<A>__{suddenly the ship is rocked violently. klaxons and alarms start to wail and the lights flicker on and off. bulkhead explodes, sending metal fragments screaming across the bridge and killing the navigator. scotty quickly takes over the dead man's console.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{report!}
<C>__{demora}
<D>__{we're caught in a gravimetric field emanating from the trailing edge of the ribbon.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{all engines, full reverse!}
<L>__{exterior space enterprise b & ribbon (vfx i)}
<A>__{the ship is turning sideways into the wake of the ribbon, but cannot break away. it is clearly being pulled along, out of control. tendrils leap up from the ribbon, lashing against the ship.}
<L>__{interior enterprise b sickbay}
<A>__{the room is filled with the survivors of the lakul. they are all members of the el auriaan race humanoid and dressed in distinctive clothing. the survivors are in various states of shock. many sit on the floor, staring into middle distance. some lie on tables, unconscious. others are mumbling incoherently to themselves. chekov and the journalists are moving from person to person trying to get control of the situation as the ship is rocked and flung about. chekov has a tricorder.}
<C>__{survivors}
<P>__{(incoherent, overlapping)}
<D>__{the colors are touching me... i'm caught in the glass... help me... i can see the seconds... over here... etc}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{it will be all right. we're going to take care of you.}
<A>__{he looks at the tricorder.}
<C>__{chekov}
<P>__{(off tricorder)}
<D>__{only minor injuries so far...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but it looks like they're all suffering from some kind of neural shock.}
<A>__{one journalist moves past a man sitting on a bio bed with a dazed look on his face. he has a nasty looking wound on one side of his face. (we will later learn that this man is named doctor soran.) the journalist is about to turn away when suddenly soran grabs him roughly clearly a man of great strength and pulls him close. soran's eyes are suddenly wild, crazed.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{why...why?}
<C>__{journalist}
<D>__{it's all right... you're safe... you're on the enterprise.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{no... i have to go... i have to get back... you don't understand! let me go!}
<A>__{soran begins to attack the journalist, but before he can do any real damage, chekov injects soran with a hypospray and soran falls unconscious.}
<C>__{journalist}
<D>__{what was he talking about?}
<A>__{suddenly a woman with her back toward us stumbles nearby. chekov quickly grabs her arm and catches her before she falls.}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{easy there...}
<A>__{the woman turns around and we see her face for the first time it's guinan. she seems dazed and confused. chekov smiles at her warmly.}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{it's going to be okay. here, just lie down.}

<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{i didn't expect to die my first day on the job.}
<A>__{kirk tries to buck up the young captain.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{the first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.}
<P>__{(beat, then louder)}
<D>__{scotty?}
<C>__{scotty}
<P>__{(outraged)}
<D>__{there's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!}
<C>__{demora}
<D>__{hull integrity failing.}
<A>__{kirk looks at scotty expectantly for a moment.}
<C>__{scotty}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{but i do have a theory...}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i thought you might.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{an anti matter discharge directly ahead... it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{a photon torpedo?}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{aye.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(quickly, to demora)}
<D>__{load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.}
<A>__{demora turns to him.}
<C>__{demora}
<D>__{captain... we don't have any torpedoes.}
<A>__{kirk glances at harriman.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{don't tell me... tuesday.}
<A>__{harriman nods, a little embarrassed. the shaking gets worse.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.}

<P>__{(onto the idea)}
<D>__{where are the deflector relays?}

<C>__{harriman}
<P>__{(to kirk)}
<D>__{i will go. you have the bridge.}
<A>__{harriman heads for the turbolift, and there is a moment as kirk is sorely tempted to take command of the ship and sit in the captain's chair one more time. but he pulls himself back before harriman can exit.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no... a captain's place is on the bridge of his ship.}
<P>__{(beat)}
