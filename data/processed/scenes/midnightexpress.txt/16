<D>__{git!}
<A>__{the cell is dark, almost black, an overpowering stench; a small grey metal bunk is bolted to the floor with a lumpy mattress. billy turns, looking back at the man staring at him from the door. ziat is quickly summing up billy's character. this is his craft.he is a prisoner and trustee. sinister man whose one motivation in life is the accumulation of money, in the pursuit of which he has acquired an ugly purplish scar running the width of his throat, various other facial scars; and one blind milky white eye. he's stocky and strong about five ten, with bushy eyebrows, brown cigarette teeth, big dirty nails, repulsively in need of a bath. what's surprising is that he is no more than thirty years old looks and behaves like sixty. the personification of the denaturalization of a man. time, body, mind all of them warped. billy, not yet attuned to his nature, only repulsed, is still wearing his own clothes and makes a shivering gesture, enunciating very clearly, hoping he will understand.}

<D>__{cold. very cold. can i get blanket? blanket?}

<A>__{goes. billy walks around the cell, hugging himself for warmth.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{pssst!}
<A>__{billy stops, goes to the edge of the cell. a bony bare arm motions from the bars of the cell next to his. we never see the face but hear a thick italian accent, hoarse and cracked.}
<C>__{voice }
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{your cell, no key. open...! blanket. three cell down. you get me one. take...}
<A>__{extends a stick with a big nail pounded into the end, twisted over to form a hook. billy takes it. hesitates.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{ziat go for night. go!}
<A>__{billy cautiously slides the cell door open, amazed that it's been left open. nothing makes any sense to him in this labyrinth another angle billy steps out into a walkway. a bare bulb overhead casts light. he glides past the three cells, seemingly empty. finds the cell with blankets, sheets, towels and various supplies stacked inside. but it's locked. he slips the stick in between the bars and stretching, hooks the first blanket. billy asleep with the blankets pulled up to his chin. suddenly dirty hands reach into frame and rip the blanket off. widen to:}

<P>__{(tugging the sheet, growls)}
<D>__{brack!...brack!}
<A>__{then slaps at billy. billy ducks away. encouraged, ziat steps up closer to him, sticks his fingers in his chest screaming.}
<C>__{ziat}
<D>__{you, goddamn you, give me sheet. give me!}
<A>__{and feints as if to hit billy again. billy reacts to defend himself, pushing ziat off and jumping out of the bunk. ziat, enraged by the shove, comes back at billy, screaming, arms flailing like a bear to pummel him, but billy, not understanding the turkish bluster in his mannerisms, meets him with a sharp right fist into the front of his face. ziat staggers back, startled into silence; he has misjudged this kid. billy waits, ready for the fight in the defensive position. the guy is bigger than himself. ziat, however, now feels the blood from his mouth and nose and freaks out, running out of the cell screaming at the top of his lungs as if he's dying.}
