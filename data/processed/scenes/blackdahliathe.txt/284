<A>__{bucky sits on the bed, his back pushed up against the wall. eyeball to eyeball with elizabeth short, betty, liz, the black dahlia. a collage of photos and file folders...}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{it came on then, big and ugly: bye bye bleichert at the bus stop, adios shitbird, has been, never was, stool pigeon harness bull.}
<L>__{exterior the slums late night}
<A>__{bucky stands in the worst of slums, his blue uniform a beacon to anyone who would do him harm.}
<C>__{voice over }
<D>__{you traded a good woman for skunk pussy, you've turned everything that's been handed you to pure, undiluted shit, your "i will's" amount to the eighth round at the academy gym when you stepped into a blanchard right hand pratfalling into clover that you turned into horse dung.}
<B>__{another elizabeth short casting session}
<A>__{no clapsticks this time. just betty short sitting an the couch. she reaches down and pulls off her pumps. now she reaches under her dress and begins unrolling her stockings. not sexy. empty and resigned.}
<C>__{voice over }
<D>__{bye bye betty, beth, betsy, liz, we were a couple of tramps, too bad we didn't meet before 39th and norton, it just might have worked. maybe us would've been the one thing we wouldn't have fucked up past redemption...}
