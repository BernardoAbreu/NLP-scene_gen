<A>__{as they walk in, she moves into the kitchen.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{want a drink?}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<A>__{she pours one for herself while he looks about. it's a stiff drink. now that he's here, her i don't want to make a fool of myself alarm is on. she flops on the sofa, watches him.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{sit down or something.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i'm circling awhile.}
<A>__{he's looking around at the clutter of her life the intimate details.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{you're not supposed to look around. i didn't have time to straighten up.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{so... it's more real this way.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{it's rude.}
<A>__{he turns to her.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{now that i'm in here, you seem mad about it.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i'm not mad. you'll know when i'm mad. i don't usually let somebody in here, but here you are. that's all. let's talk about something stupid.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{you first.}
<A>__{she smiles in spite of herself.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{okay one thing i don't believe is that 'supposed to' business. we were 'supposed to' meet. that sounds a little fringy to me, like something you might hear on public access tv. you believe that?}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{some people say we each give off a particular odor that can only be detected by one other person's brain.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{so, we... smell each other? who says that?}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i have no idea.}
<P>__{(as they smile)}
<D>__{i'm more in the destiny school, we met in another life school. do you believe that? do you think when we die we come back in another form?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{you mean like a duck? no. i think dead is dead. i've been thinking about it all day and i don't want to think about it anymore.}
<A>__{he looks at her, steps close to her, takes the drink out of her hand, puts it to his lips and drinks it all down. he puts the glass on the table.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{why'd you do that?}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{see? now you're thinking about me.}
<A>__{she gets a half smile, assessing him. her look is direct, and the attraction is there. he feels it, too, and he deflects it, nodding toward a large photomural of snowcapped mountains.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{let me guess. colorado.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{it's austria, but i can't picture myself in austria. i'm not good with languages, so i couldn't qualify for the departments over there.}
<A>__{she rises and goes to a desk and takes the holstered gun off her ankle. she takes the cuffs off her belt, the mace from her jacket, the shield from her shirt pocket, puts them all in a desk drawer. she takes off her jacket and throws it over a chair. disarmed, she turns to him. her look is all wanting and pushing away, almost fierce in her struggle. he sees this.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{thanks for... coming up here.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{does that mean i'm going?}
<C>__{sharon}
<P>__{(flustered)}
<D>__{no. you don't have to. i...}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{you okay now?}
<A>__{her eyes grow a bit hard, defensive.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{oh. you're here as a medic.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{is this the mad part?}
<A>__{she smiles in spite of herself again. he has gotten to her. she wants to fall into this guy, but she's pumping those brakes. they are standing close together.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{maybe going is a good idea.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{can i come back some time?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{catch}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{must be the smell.}
<A>__{that makes her laugh, and her resistance falls away with her surprised laughter, and she puts her hands around the back of his neck. her touch is electric to him. she is going in for a kiss, and he is retreating. they stare a moment and then he suddenly takes her shoulders and lets loose his own longing. it is a hungry and passionate kiss, and in the very midst of it, he breaks off and pulls back, his darkness rushing at him. she is staring, surprised, and he is looking a bit shaken, getting the words out just above a whisper.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i better go.}
<A>__{she doesn't know what to say. the moment hangs. he leaves. once he closes the door, the breath escapes her, and she shakes her head feeling like an idiot. she lost control. with a stranger.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{oh, god.}
