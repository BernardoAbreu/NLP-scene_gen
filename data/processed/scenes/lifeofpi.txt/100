<A>__{the tiger turns and looks over the side of the boat into the water; pi rises and looks over the side as well, staring into the depths... rp's pov starting on his own reflection in the water and traveling downward, through schools of darting tuna, squid and lantern fish, past fleeting memories of a storm and zoo animals struggling to survive in churning waters and into the darkest recesses of the sea, pi finding a broken ship and memories of a former life lying dormant on the ocean floor... out of pov richard parker looks over at pi as he gazes into the water. cut to an extremely wide shot of the boat floating in a sea of stars.}
