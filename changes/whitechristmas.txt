<DIAL>__{"WHITE CHRISTMAS" by Melvin Frank, Norman Krasna and Norman Panama}
<ACTION>__{FULL SHOT - REAR AREA - (DAY) - (GLASS) This is December 24, 1944, in the first safe area directly behind the battle line, in the Italian theatre. In the distance occasional artillery light flashes are seen and artillery rumbles are heard.  The battered terrain shows the effects of battle. In the foreground is a recreation area, covered with camouflage; entertainment is in progress on a raised stage. Men of the division are seated about on benches, boxes, and the ground.  A camouflaged motor pool of jeeps and tanks is nearby. MED. SHOT - NEAR RECREATION AREA We can HEAR LAUGHTER and APPLAUSE from the men as a jeep with two stars on the front indicating it is the General's car jounces along a road toward the side of the recreation area.  A YOUNG SERGEANT is at the wheel, an ADJUTANT beside him, and in the rear are GENERAL WAVERLY and GENERAL CARLTON. JEEP - MED. CLOSE As it jounces along.  General Waverly is weather-beaten and weary; his uniform, while neat, shows the effects of long wear.  General Carlton, on the other hand, is stiff, clean and fresh from the Pentagon. He is staring off at the recreation area.}

During the second chorus he starts up the aisle, revealing for the first time that his left leg is bandaged to the knee. The Adjutant puts out his arm to help. Waverly refuses. Toward the finish of the song, he turns, faces the men and salutes them.  The men return the salute. (This is not a military mistake, the General salutes the enlisted men as a deliberate gesture.)  There is a Red Cross ambulance standing by.}

A shell BURSTS in the vicinity. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND PHIL Phil pulls Bob down in time to save him from the shrapnel burst.  This has also pushed Bob's face into the mud, which he thinks is unnecessary.  Phil, ignoring Bob's hostile look, brightly continues with WHITE CHRISTMAS from where the song left off.

CAMERA PASSES Waverly and moves to: STAGE - FULL SHOT - MOVING CAMERA Center stage, there is a large cutout of a decorated Christmas tree.  Also, there is considerable Christmas holly, mistletoe, etc.  Bob and Betty are seen singing.  Throughout action of this number Phil and Judy dance.  In addition there is staged movement by the ensemble.  Bob and Betty are on each side of the cutout Christmas tree, but it is obvious that Betty is preoccupied with some stage business which she is manipulating with one hand behind the cutout tree. CAMERA FOLLOWS Bob and Betty as their movement takes them behind the tree.  It is now that we see very clearly that the rear wall of the stage (two immense barn doors) has opened; in b.g. we see the Vermont countryside being covered by the falling snow.  Also, we see pine trees in the snow that are decorated. Betty steers Bob to a point directly beneath a sprig of mistletoe from which is also hanging the mate to the sock she gave him in scene 110.  Bob looks up, sees the mistletoe and the sock, and smiles at Betty. She lifts one of his trouser legs and we see that he is wearing the other sock.  They laugh and embrace. REVERSE SHOT - FROM DINING ROOM The cutout tree onstage rises to the flies and now the real trees and falling snow in b.g. are completely visible.  One by one, the trees are lighted. AUDIENCE - MED.
