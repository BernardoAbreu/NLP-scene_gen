<L>__{interior carnby's loft day 115}
<A>__{carnby unlocks the multiple locks on the front door to his loft and enters. he carries a heavy duffle bag. he looks exhausted. warily, carnby holds out the hand held scanner, checking to see if it registers anything. but the loft reads clean. carnby puts the scanner down on a counter and allows himself to relax as he enters the loft. carnby walks in slowly, a man whose adrenaline is wearing off and is only now feeling the pain. he shrugs off his trench coat and lets it drop on the floor. he drops the duffle bag on the floor. he kicks off his boots. he pulls off his holster and gun and drops them on a table. carnby takes out the lynchpin artifact. he puts it down on a work station in the lab area. carnby pulls off his shirt. his back is marked with old scars and fresh bruises. carnby walks over to his bed. he drops down onto the bed. his body sinks down, finally relaxing.}
