<L>__{exterior pool area day}
<A>__{fletcher, happy to have someone to talk to, walks up to frank with his remote control speed boat. frank would like to walk away, but fletcher blocks his way. frank looks at fletcher's frail little, nut brown figure. the watching nanny continues her embroidering, some way off.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{hi!}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing to walk)}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{how are you today?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(wants to keep walking)}
<D>__{all right. how 'bout yourself?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{oh, i'm fine. do you like boats?}
<A>__{frank gives up. he's not going to get out of here. he stops.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no. i don't like boats.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{you don't! why not?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{oh, i don't know.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{sure you do, but you don't want to tell me.}
<A>__{frank considers him, then slips out of his sport coat. he crouches down so that he is eye level with fletcher.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you're a smart kid.}
<A>__{fletcher nods.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i will tell you. one time i was stuck on a boat with some people for four months.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{a lifeboat?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{nope. a big white yacht. do you know what a yacht is?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<P>__{(thinks about this)}
<D>__{yeah. my mom rented this huge yacht once, and we took a trip. it was great. everyone threw up except me. i love 'em.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(standing to leave)}
<D>__{well, nobody's perfect.}
<A>__{fletcher squints up at him, the sun in his eyes.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{you're the bodyguard, aren't you?}
<A>__{frank is surprised.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what do you know about it?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{i've got ears.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i will remember that.}
<A>__{devaney trots into the pool area, out of breath. he is holding a bulging manila file. as he sees fletcher, he holds the file casually at his side. frank sees fletcher looking at the file.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{how are you, fletch?}
<P>__{(to frank)}
<D>__{i'm glad you waited. let's go over here.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(to fletcher)}
<D>__{nice meeting you.}
<A>__{fletcher looks after them silently.}
