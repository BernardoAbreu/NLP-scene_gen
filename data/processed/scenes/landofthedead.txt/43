<L>__{interior board room fiddler's green day}
<A>__{a uniformed guard leaves cholo in a pristine white conference room with glass walls overlooking the rotting city far below. cholo sets the case of champagne and the box of cohibas on a conference table. a sman stands in silhouette at the windows.}
<C>__{ilhouetted man}
<D>__{how was uniontown?}
<C>__{cholo}
<D>__{dead.}
<C>__{silhouetted man}
<D>__{death intrudes on us even in the green, i'm afraid. i heard about what happened with my neighbors. i'm grateful for your help.}
<C>__{cholo}
<D>__{brought you back some presents.}
<A>__{cholo opens the case of champagne. he pulls a bottle out, untwists the wire, and uses his strong thumbs to pop the cork. foam runs.}
<C>__{cholo }
<D>__{ou probably want a glass, don't you? sure, a high toned man likes to drink out of a glass.}
<A>__{cholo grabs a highball glass from a cupboard, pours champagne into it, and brings it, overflowing, to the silhouetted man.}
<C>__{cholo}
<D>__{i got something else, too.}
<A>__{cholo tears open the box of cohibas. he picks up two cigars, bites off the tips, puts one in his mouth, then, walking back to the silhouetted man, puts the other in his mouth, lighting them both with a wooden match that he strikes on his jeans.}
<C>__{f}
<C>__{silhouetted man}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{cholo}
<D>__{no, thank you! twenty grand. that's what i got comin' for last night. i never bothered to pick it up.}
<C>__{s}
<C>__{ilhouetted man}
<D>__{you didn't?}
<C>__{cholo}
<D>__{nope. i left it in the bank. your bank. with all my other dough. rom all those other nights. i got enough now to buy me a place.}
<C>__{silhouetted man}
<D>__{you mean here? in the green?}
<A>__{the silhouetted man steps away from the window. expensively dressed, in his early 60s, he is paul kaufman. he sets down the highball glass cholo gave him, gets out a proper champagne flute, and fills it from the bottle, smiling politely at cholo.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mister demora, but there's a very long waiting list.}
<C>__{cholo}
<D>__{how long?}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{this is an extremely desirable location. space is limited.}
<C>__{cholo}
<D>__{you mean restricted.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{well, i do have a board of directors, a membership committee that has to approve...}
<A>__{a wave of incomparable sadness sweeps over cholo's face.}
<C>__{cholo}
<D>__{i guess it takes more than money to become a "member".}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{take my advice. withdraw your funds from the bank and spend them somewhere else.}
<C>__{cholo}
<P>__{(quietly) don't do this to me. don't}
<D>__{do this to me.}
<C>__{aufman}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but...}
<C>__{cholo}
<D>__{no, no, no. three years! three years i been cleaning up after you, taking out your garbage, and you tell me i'm not good enough? you're the one who's no good. you are no fucking good. and you are gonna let me in. you know why? because i know what goes on around here. how many of your fucking "members" know what's in that garbage i take out for you?}
<A>__{cholo lunges at kaufman, grabs him by the collar.}
<C>__{cholo }
<C>__{ou'll let me in or i will...}
<A>__{cholo feels the barrel of a .45 against his waist. kaufman, who has drawn the pistol from his jacket, is still smiling.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{maybe we should talk about this when you're less excited.}
<A>__{kaufman presses a button under the table. three security guards rush in, grab cholo, and drag him away. kaufman stops one of the guards at the door.}
<C>__{kaufman }
<D>__{softly) i won't be needing this man any more.}
