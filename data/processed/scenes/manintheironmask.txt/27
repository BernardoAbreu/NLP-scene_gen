<L>__{interior the favorite mistress' palace rooms day}
<A>__{a young musketeer ushers michelle into the palace bedroom previously occupied by the king's last mistress. the musketeer leaves her alone, frozen in the center of the room, awed by the opulence. her eyes play over the details: the handcarved, richly upholstered furniture, beneath her fingertips... the carved figures of cherubic angels, gleaming with gold, upon the posts of the bed... the murals on the walls and ceiling... her reverie is interrupted by a handmaiden who bustles in carrying a magnificent dress.}

<D>__{after your bath put on this, it is the king's favorite color. that letter on the desk came here for you this morning.}
<A>__{she tosses the dress onto the bed and is gone. left alone, michelle lifts the letter, and recognizes the writing.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{raoul!}
<A>__{she opens the letter and reads quickly.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{the army! oh raoul, don't despair! i will always be faithful...}
<A>__{she interrupts herself as her eyes fall on the gorgeous dress. she looks around at the sumptuous palace apartment, and gazes again at the murals painted above the bed. they depict naked gods and goddesses, in olympian orgies.}
