<A>__{in the inner courtyard, there are benches and chairs arranged in rows. in front of all of them, there are two chairs separated from the rest, one next to the other. in front of them, there is a small table with a pen and inkstand on top. the people remain standing, about twenty algerians, of all ages. they are speaking among themselves in thick whispers. there is an expectant and ceremonious atmosphere.}

<A>__{mahmoud was seventeen then. he has soft down on his cheeks, his first beard. he is thin, his neck long and tense, his glance nervous. he appears to be the protagonist of what is about to take place. his hair is combed with care and covered with much hair cream. he is wearing a clean and newly bought white costume. many of the others come to speak with him; the younger ones are joking and trying to provoke him.}
