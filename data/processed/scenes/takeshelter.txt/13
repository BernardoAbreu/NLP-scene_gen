<L>__{interior delta agri pro main office day}
<A>__{the main headquarters of delta agri pro is housed in a giant metal building. a row of cheaply built, 70's style offices with drop tile ceilings line the left of a large warehouse that contains all manner of agricultural and construction equipment. tractors, backhoes, welding rigs, etc. a group of men, many of which were represented at gator's bar yesterday, sit in folding chairs or stand in a semi circle around jim thompson(53). he speaks, clipboard in hand.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i didn't say you had control over the weather russell, what i did say was that the top shelf has to be cleared by the 15th. that's non negotiable.}
<A>__{dewart eats from a bag of sunflower seeds. curtis stares down at his forearm. he rubs the skin there. jim runs a finger down his clipboard.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{umm, curtis. where we at on that east 82nd site?}
<A>__{curtis snaps his head up, takes a second.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{yesterday slowed us down. we couldn't get the second pilot hole drilled.}
<A>__{jim drops his head and the clipboard falls to his side. a melodramatic move.}
