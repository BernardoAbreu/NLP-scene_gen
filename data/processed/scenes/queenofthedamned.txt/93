<L>__{interior lestat's house (los angeles) sound studio night}
<A>__{loud, intense music as the band rehearses. lestat creates a fantastic melody around the beat. he lets the note trail off, eyes closed, smiling, the reverb still ringing in the room. lestat hears something, turns. outside, in the hollywood hills, dogs are howling across the canyons like wolves. lestat crosses to the huge glass doors, goes outside...}
<L>__{exterior house continuous action}
<A>__{lestat stares out at the ominous night. as maudy and the band continue to play, the wolflike howls in the night get louder. and beneath it all, a deep pulse beats. the song comes to an end. lestat turns, gazes back at the band through the window, at their excitement. he comes back inside.}
