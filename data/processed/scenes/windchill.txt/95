<A>__{the rungs are icy, forcing her to climb slower than she would like. she keeps her eyes forward, never once looking down. when the wind gusts she pauses and waits for it to subside. she's midway to the top when her foot slips on an icy rung. she clutches the pole tightly, wind whistling in her ears. she waits until her heart slows and she's recovered from her near fall. then looks up to gauge the distance left to the junction box. keeps climbing. she reaches the last rung at the top of the telephone pole. it's noisy up here, thanks to the wind and the icy telephone wires, source of the mysterious humming she's been hearing. she tries the little metal door of the grey junction box. locked.}

<A>__{she fumbles in her coat, takes out the scissors, uses them to try and pry open the junction box (which turns out to be frozen shut, not locked after all.) it finally yields, opening. revealing a rat's nest of multicolored wires and phone jacks. hurrying now, she tugs her glove off with her teeth, and with her bare hand retrieves the cord wrapped receiver from inside her sweater. in her effort to juggle all these items she loses her grip on the scissors... which drop all the way down to disappear in the snow below. she concentrates now on the receiver. but her fingers are so clumsy from the cold, she fumbles it. and the receiver falls too. then jerks to a stop a few feet below as it reaches the limit of its cord. which she's managed to catch. she winds the receiver up by its cord, finally plugs the jack end into the junction box. hears a dial tone.}

<A>__{the connection sparks and she feels a small shock that makes her drop the phone. when she retrieves it and holds it back to her ear the line is dead. no way of knowing if her message got through. it's a moment of such soul crushing despair she shuts her eyes and leans her head against the pole, as if wanting to just quietly die up here thirty feet above the earth.}
