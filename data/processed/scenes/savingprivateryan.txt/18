<L>__{exterior normandy field h.q. 19th infantry day}
<A>__{chaos. under fire. intermittent mortars, some big german shells and fairly close small arms fire.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{runs over the broken ground and makes it to the sandbagged h.q. he stumbles down the make shift stairs.}
<L>__{interior h.q. sandbagged bunker day}
<A>__{sand and dirt falls with the closest of the explosions which continue through the scene. miller salutes a major.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{miller, company b, second rangers.}
<A>__{major go on in. miller goes deeper into the h.q. bunker where he finds a dozen officers with as many aides, runners and radiomen. very busy. a field map dominates the center of the small space. the men in the room note miller, a few nod to him respectfully. he's clearly someone special. colonel sam anderson is in command, talking on a field phone. he's about fifty, firm and steady, the calm at the eye of the storm. he sees miller and motions for him to wait.}
<C>__{colonel anderson}
<P>__{(into field phone)}
<D>__{...i understand your problem, but if we don't get those tanks off loaded by 0600, we're going to have an entire division up at caen with its ass hanging out of its pants...}
<A>__{a lieutenant steps up to miller and hands him a sheet of paper. lieutenant captain, here's your company address list.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{my what?}
<A>__{lieutenant for letters to the families of your killed in action. miller hands the list back to the lieutenant.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{find a chaplain.}
<C>__{colonel anderson}
<P>__{(into field phone)}
<D>__{...alright, let me know when.}
<A>__{anderson hangs up, speaks to an aide.}
<C>__{colonel anderson}
<D>__{have the second and third regiments hold at st. michel until we get those tanks. aide yes, sir.}
<A>__{colonel anderson turns to miller.}
<C>__{colonel anderson}
<D>__{report.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{sector four is secured, we put out the last three german one fifty fives, found them about two miles in from ponte du hoc.}
<C>__{colonel anderson}
<D>__{resistance?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{a company, wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.}
<C>__{colonel anderson}
<D>__{casualties?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{fourty four, twenty one dead.}
<A>__{an instant of silence, all hear, none look.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{they didn't want to give up those one fifty fives, sir.}
<C>__{colonel anderson}
<D>__{it was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{colonel anderson}
<D>__{where are your men now?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.}
<C>__{colonel anderson}
<D>__{i'm sending simpson to take over for you, the division is going to caen, you're not coming with us, i have something else for you.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{colonel anderson}
<D>__{there's a private james ryan who parachuted in with the hundred and first near ramelle. i want you to take a squad up there. if he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation. take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{a private, sir?}
<C>__{colonel anderson}
<D>__{he's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. this is straight from the chief of staff.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{but, sir...i...i...}
<C>__{colonel anderson}
<D>__{spit it out, captain.}
<A>__{miller hesitates, then:}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to ramelle to save one private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sir.}
<A>__{the other officers freeze, listening without turning. colonel anderson glares at miller.}
<C>__{colonel anderson}
<D>__{you think just because you hold the congressional medal of honor, you can say any damn thing you please to your superior officers?}
<A>__{miller considers the question, then smiles.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{yes, sir, more or less.}
<A>__{colonel anderson looks as if he's about to bit miller's head off, then he smiles, too.}
<C>__{colonel anderson}
<D>__{alright, i will give you that. continue.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{the numbers don't make sense, sir. his brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away. one private is simply not worth a squad. colonel anderson this one is. he's worth a lot more than that. which is why i'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.}
<A>__{miller shrugs.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{yes and no, sir, what about morgan? fine officer, regular church goer, writes poetry, he might like a mission like this.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and he's taller than me.}
<A>__{colonel anderson listens with amused tolerance, but it's time to get back to business.}
<C>__{colonel anderson}
<D>__{that's enough, captain, you have your orders. major thomas will fill you in.}
<A>__{miller knows when to back off. he salutes.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{miller and colonel anderson exchange a private look.}
<C>__{colonel anderson}
<D>__{good luck, john.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{thank you, sir.}
<A>__{miller joins major thomas at one of the smaller map tables. colonel anderson watches miller for an instant, then notices the other officers in the tent watching. a glare and they go back to work.}
