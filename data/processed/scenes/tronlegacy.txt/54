<A>__{d rezz, astride the crevasse, sees light cycles speeding his way. he's got the rom ball poised to intercept tron. i beem de rezzes into the grid, clearing the path. rush and krod taunt tron into the trap... but, out of nowhere, mega reaches to rush's handlebars and turns 90 degrees too soon.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{hey, what are you ??}
<A>__{tron sees the bail out, knows something's wrong. he looks ahead, sees d rezz astride his crevasse escape root, rom ball poised in the air. tron bails out 90 degrees, cutting behind krod. krod turns twice, ending up in tron's lane. to the side, rush's light cycle screams toward solid rock, vibrating out of control. rush grabs mega and jumps off. they slide on the grid, holding each other. krod's lightcycle heads for the rock escape passage.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{no! it's me!}
<A>__{rush and mega slide to a halt, in time to see: their light cycle smashes rocks, explodes in a million bits.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{why did you do that?!}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{i i got scared!}
<A>__{krod shoots gap. d rezz is ready to smash him with his romball.}
<D>__{i beem no! it's krod! tron is over there!}
<A>__{d rezz makes mental switch, hurls romball. romball bounces down solid rock, onto game grid, rolls with ferocious speed, diagonally across the grid. romball curves to track tron like a great bowling shot. romball clips rear wheel of tron's lightcycle. lightcycle vaporizes. tron skids and tumbles. i beem zaps beside rush and mega. krod and d rezz join them.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{there he goes!}
<A>__{tron climbs over rocks, escaping through a tunnel.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{we've got him now. let's go!}
<A>__{whoosh! electro fire romball careens across grid, bearing down on them. group dives clear. d rezz swings in a foot, stopping the romball inches short of mowing down krod.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{i could have done that.}
<A>__{he strobes, freezes, hits the deck.}
