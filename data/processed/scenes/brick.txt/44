<A>__{brendan stops at a high wall of weeds, listening to the low gurgle of moving water. slowly, robotically he pushes through. emily's body face down, bobbing gently in shallow water. bluish white. red foam clings to her.}
<L>__{exterior runoff tunnel}
<A>__{silently, as if lowered by a string brendan sinks down, squatting in the mud. his lungs empty in one choppy breath. he pulls his glasses off sluggishly. emily's arm lifeless, pale. brendan's face a contorted, frozen mask, eyes wet. emily's hair stringy, flowing gently in the water. brendan's eyes dazed, drifting... then suddenly snapping to attention. a noise. from the tunnel. brendan freezes. the inky blackness of the tunnel mouth opens like a vacuum... silent, but then the scrape of a shoe against concrete, then echoing footsteps running away. brendan springs like a cat, sprinting into the tunnel.}
