<L>__{interior corridors labyrinth}
<A>__{we are looking straight down one of the very long corridors of hell. it has the same architecture as the corridor that appeared in the hospital room in hellraiser; walls of stained gray stone broken up by vaguely medieval looking arches. kirsty comes into view, walking away from the camera. ahead of her, at an illogically far distance given that she entered the corridor only seconds before kirsty, is tiffany. kirsty breaks into a slight run, and calls out to the girl.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{tiffany. wait!}
<A>__{her voice has an unpleasant ring in the acoustics of these corridors and echos horribly. kirsty pulls a face and doesn't shout again. she increases her pace slightly. suddenly tiffany makes a sharp turn and enters an intersecting corridor. kirsty is forced to increase her speed even more. kirsty too makes the turn into another corridor. even as she does so, she sees tiffany disappearing again into yet another intersection. kirsty follows and, again, the same thing happens. this happens several times and, always, kirsty never quite loses sight of tiffany but never quite catches up with her either. in short, tiffany's instincts were absolutely right; this too is another puzzle. the girls are lost in a concrete maze, full of twists and turns and labyrinthine windings. after enough turns have been made to completely confuse kirsty's sense of direction, she makes a final turn into one corridor and sees something different. at the end of this corridor is a blinding white light. as soon as kirsty sees the light, the air is filled with beautiful birdsong. tiffany disappears into the light as soon as kirsty sees it. despite the light, despite the birdsong, kirsty is still suspicious and shouts out.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{tiffany! don't trust it! don't trust it!}
<A>__{but it is too late. the girl is gone. kirsty follows and vanishes into the light.}
