<L>__{exterior gas station late afternoon}
<A>__{a rundown gas station sits off to the side of the road. a filthy mechanic works on one of the many junked cars. two fat greasy men sit in the hot sun playing cards. a chevy nova sits parked next to the station. willis leans against the side of the car, drinking coffee from a styrofoam cup. a police cruiser pulls up. wydell and naish step from the car.}
<C>__{wydell}
<D>__{mr. willis?}
<C>__{mr. willis}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{wydell}
<D>__{i'm wydell... this is naish.}
<A>__{wydell extends his hand, they shake hands.}
<C>__{naish}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{mr. willis}
<D>__{george willis...}
<P>__{(to wydell)}
<D>__{...any leads?}
<C>__{wydell}
<D>__{well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this pointerior}
<C>__{mr. willis}
<D>__{that's it?}
<C>__{wydell}
<D>__{well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call deadwood to play nancy drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls dr. satan.}
<C>__{mr. willis}
<D>__{dr. satan?}
<C>__{naish}
<D>__{yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.}
<C>__{wydell}
<D>__{anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, i figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms.}
<C>__{mr. willis}
<D>__{what about the body you found?}
<C>__{wydell}
<P>__{(slightly surprised)}
<D>__{oh, yeah, you know about that? hmmm, that's a strange one.}
<C>__{naish}
<D>__{local girl, karen murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.}
<C>__{mr. willis}
<D>__{fit the profile?}
<C>__{naish}
<D>__{no, not really. good kid, never been in any trouble.}
<C>__{wydell}
<D>__{her part in this i can't figure... but i will.}
<C>__{mr. willis}
<P>__{(wipes his brow)}
<D>__{christ, you know it's crazy...}
<P>__{(gets choked up)}
<D>__{i lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. always cool and calm, but... but i never thought i'd be the one needing help, ya know?}
<C>__{naish}
<D>__{don't worry, we'll find her.}
<C>__{wydell}
<D>__{let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.}
<A>__{willis dumps out the remaining coffee, tosses the cup into the trash and opens the back door of the police car. he gets inside. wydell and naish climb in. the car drives off.}
