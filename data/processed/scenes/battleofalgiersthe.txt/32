<A>__{the policeman enjoys watching them, then asks what it's about. all five of them answer him at once, trying to outdo one another. the policeman has to shout to make them keep quiet. then, assuming a very humble behavior, they enter silently. the oldest among them speaks in a mournful voice. he seems to be crying and asks the sergeant something. the policeman calls a colleague, and tells him to accompany the algerians. four of them go with the policeman, while another remains in the waiting room, saying that it is better because he is afraid of losing his control. then he begins to explain the reasons for the quarrel: it concerns a will. the old man is his grandfather, but he has recently remarried. then from inside is heard ... machine gun fire. the policeman reacts quickly and tries to draw his gun. but the algerian is faster and fires point blank. the four reappear. one of them is wounded. all of them are armed with revolvers, and carry at their sides a machine gun and two sub machine guns that they have taken from the armory. other cries and shots are heard behind them. all five of them run out in haste.}
