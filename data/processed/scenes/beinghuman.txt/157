<L>__{exterior holiday house night}
<A>__{the car pulls up at the holiday house. hector gets out. it is dark, but we can hear the sound of the sea and there is sand underfoot. hector walks to the house and unlocks the door. he puts on a couple of exterior lights. he carries thomas, still sleeping, from the car and into the house. betsy follows him, still half asleep, groaning fussily. she talks through her yawns.}
