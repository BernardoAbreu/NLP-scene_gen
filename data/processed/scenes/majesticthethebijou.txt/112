<L>__{interior city council meeting room day}
<A>__{a meeting of the lawson city council is in session, mayor cole presiding. of the dozen council members, we also recognize avery wyatt and roscoe fitts. vera dwight, the council secretary, a cherubic woman in her 40s, is reading the minutes of the last meeting.}
<C>__{vera}
<D>__{finally, roscoe fitts moved, and red curtis seconded, that the council form a committee to investigate the adoption of a new property taxation structure. motion carried, nine to two, one abstention.}
<A>__{as vera speaks, the meeting room door opens and luke, harry, old time and mrs. terwilliger slip inside and take seats on the unoccupied benches.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{thanks, vera.}
<A>__{ernie notices luke and the trio.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{well, the chair notes the presence this morning of luke and harry trumbo and the rest of the bijou staff. frankly, the chair notes the presence of just about anyone who ever finds their way into one of these meetings. g'moring, folks. luke & the trio good morning.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{i'm just guessing, but i bet it's not a sudden interest in lawson politics that brings you all here.}
<A>__{luke stands.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well, no...}
<P>__{(clears his throat)}
<D>__{i wanted to thank you all for giving me such a nice welcome, and making me feel at home. but i... we're... actually here on business of a sort...}
<A>__{daley thornhill, 30s, the council parliamentarian, pipes up. he's waving a copy of "roberts rules of order."}
<C>__{daley}
<D>__{point of order, mr. mayor, this comes under the heading "new business," and this is not the time...}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{i think we can make an exception here, daley.}
<C>__{daley}
<D>__{it'll need to be moved and seconded.}
<A>__{ernie rolls his eyes, then quickly and mechanically, without inflection:}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{all right, motion to hear the speaker out of order.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{seconded.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{motion on the floor, discussion open, discussion closed, all those in favor signify by saying "aye."}
<C>__{all}
<D>__{aye.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{opposed? hearing no opposition, the motion is carried.}
<A>__{pause. ernie turns to luke and smiles.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{go ahead, son.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{thanks. well, i will make this short and sweet. the bijou needs a lot of repairs, and the truth of the matter is, harry, um, that is, dad and me, mrs. terwilliger and old tim, we can't possible afford them all. so, i'd like to ask your help to... well, to scrounge around a bit, and see if you have anything that might help us out.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{what kinds of things are you talking about?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh, paint, brushes, plaster, light bulbs, yardage, and if you can't come up with any of that, we can use some old fashioned elbow grease.}
<A>__{fitts leans forward.}
<C>__{fitts}
<D>__{so... you do intend to fix the place up after all?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{mr. fitts, with all due respect, i think lawson needs the bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. and i think lawson deserves the bijou. there's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...}
<A>__{he looks at harry and smiles.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{... but i think a good dose of magic is as good a place as any to start.}
<A>__{the council members murmur amongst themselves, then:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<P>__{(eagerly)}
<D>__{motion to encourage the citizenry of lawson to help out the bijou in any way they can...}
<C>__{daley}
<P>__{(a subtle reminder)}
<D>__{... short of the allocation of city funds...}
<C>__{wyatt}
<P>__{(agreeing)}
<D>__{... short of allocation of city funds.}
<C>__{daley}
<P>__{(enthusiastically)}
<D>__{seconded!}
<C>__{ernie}
<P>__{(brightly)}
<D>__{motion on the floor, discussion open, discussion closed, all those in favor signify by saying "aye."}
<C>__{all}
<D>__{aye!}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{hearing no opposition, the motion is carried! congratulations, luke, you got yourself a town to help you out!}
