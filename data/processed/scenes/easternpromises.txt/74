<L>__{interior helen's house. anna's bedroom morning}
<D>__{anna is lying awake, her curtains drawn against the daylight. helen knocks and enters with a cup of tea, just as in the opening scenes. anna sits up.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(almost accusing)}
<D>__{have you slept at all? anna doesn't answer. helen looks anxious as she peeks out of the curtains.}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{i tried to get hold of stepan for you. a pause.}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{he's usually either at home or at his sisters. but she hasn't heard from him at all. helen is trying to hide her anxiety but anna sees it.}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{he did spit in that horrible man's face.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i don't think the driver would do anything to stepan. helen knows anna well, senses some flicker of attraction.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{how do you know what he would do? a pause.}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{you haven't spoken to him since, have you? anna doesn't answer and helen's anger sparks... she leaves and slams the door.}
