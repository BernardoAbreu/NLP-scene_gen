<L>__{interior osborne house, upper servant's table night}
<A>__{the clatter and crush of the upper servant's table as upper servants sit themselves down to dinner while under servants prepare to serve soup. archie comes in and sits himself somewhere in the middle next to an empty seat. a moment later, brown strides in. but instead of sitting at the place beside his brother, he goes straight to the head of the table and plonks himself down. slowly, the clatter dies away as the whole room stops and stares at him in silence. brown fixes them with a look. an elderly butler steps into the room and stares in amazement at brown. a smooth young man, bertie's valet, hurries up to intercede.}
<C>__{bertie's valet}
<D>__{mr. carter, the head butler, sits there.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{not now he doesn't. this is my place.}
<C>__{bertie's valet}
<D>__{by whose authority?}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{my own.}
<A>__{a little frisson of oh my gawdness. bertie's valet stares icily at him.}
<C>__{bertie's valet}
<D>__{the order of seating at the upper servant's table is arranged personally by the queen herself.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{that's a tautology lad.}
<P>__{(unable to stop himself seriously explaining it)}
<D>__{if you say the queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally. that's understood.}
<A>__{but as far as bertie's valet is concerned, it isn't. he stares down in mute fury, then snaps his fingers at one of the under servants, who rushes over. there is a hurried exchange of whispers before the under servant rushes out. unperturbed, brown brings out his flask and pours himself a substantial draft of whiskey. he turns to the pretty assistant dresser, sitting to his right.}
<C>__{brown }
<D>__{are you dresser to her majesty?}
<A>__{she blinks nervously at him.}
<C>__{assistant dresser}
<D>__{assistant, sir, yes.}
<A>__{brown tucks into his soup. everyone watches and waits.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{assistant dresser}
<D>__{mary taylor, sir.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{have i seen you up in balmoral, mary?}
<C>__{assistant dresser}
<D>__{i hope to go up next year.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{you wouldn't happen to know what the queen's reading for recreation, would you, mary?}
<A>__{the assistant dresser thinks for a moment.}
<C>__{assistant dresser}
<D>__{lord tennyson, sir?}
<A>__{brown nods. all conversation stops as the under servant bursts back in. she halts at the door, looking blankly from bertie's valet to the elderly butler. a beat. the old man stiffens and makes his way to the middle of the table. brown looks up from his soup.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{am i the only one eating?}
<A>__{with a clatter of spoons, everyone obediently eats.}
