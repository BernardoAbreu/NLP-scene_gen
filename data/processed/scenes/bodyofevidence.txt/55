<L>__{exterior courthouse afternoon}
<A>__{dulaney walks down the steps. cardenas joins him.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{i'm surprised you can walk after the way burnham chewed your ass out this afternoon.}
<A>__{cardenas grins. his comment was meant as a friendly jab between old friends. dulaney doesn't see it that way.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{i've got work to do.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{hey the bell's sounded. it's between rounds.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i didn't hear it.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what's happening to you, frank? you're acting like you're on trial here. this has become personal to you.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{back off, john.}
<A>__{cardenas studies him for a moment.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{you're sleeping with her, aren't you?}
<A>__{dulaney forces a laugh. it's not a very convincing one.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{that's ridiculous.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{i'm talking to you as a friend now. don't ruin your life, your career for her. she'll spit you out when this is over.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{you don't know what you're talking about.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{really? what does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{you've been following me?}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{her. it's an obvious move. i'm building a case against her, remember?}
<A>__{something in dulaney snaps. he grabs cardenas and pushes him up against the wall. cardenas pushes back.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{if your head wasn't up your ass you would have thought of it too. you're losing perspective. get out while you can before she takes you down with her.}
