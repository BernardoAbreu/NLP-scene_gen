<P>__{(she locks the door)}
<D>__{look, i've been working this case for months now...}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{so what's your story?}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{they think i'm a crooked customs agent.}
<A>__{lee examines the stack of hundred dollar bills from hu li's package. carter checks out the suite, pocketing some of the food from the mini fridge.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{is this a payoff?}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{no. it's a sample. you guys ever heard of the superbill?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{it's a myth. some kind of counterfeit.}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{it's much more than a counterfeit. out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference. the paper is crane linen blend and the bills are printed on u.s. intaglio presses.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{how're they getting into the u.s. mint to use the presses?}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{in 1959, the united states was very friendly with the shah of iran. we wanted his oil, so for the shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift a u.s. treasury intaglio press. the only one to ever leave the country. five years ago ricky tan bought that press on the black market.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{five years ago?!}
<P>__{(beat)}

<A>__{lee and carter exchange looks.}
<C>__{isabella}

<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(understanding)}
<D>__{and hu li killed him for the plates.}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{yes. they've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.}
<A>__{isabella lights a hundred dollar bill on fire, and it burns}
<B>__{red.}
<C>__{isabella }
<D>__{they use an optical transfer ink from india that burns red the real ink burns black.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{what the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{the real question is, where are the plates? if we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.}
<A>__{isabella thinks for a beat.}
<C>__{isabella }
<D>__{maybe that's where you can help us. carter, this is your city, right?}
<A>__{carter nods.}
