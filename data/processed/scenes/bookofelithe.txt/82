<L>__{exterior san francisco pier 39 day}
<A>__{a dead, ruined place, like everywhere else. we hear the sound of seagulls nearby the only sign of life at all. eli and solara walk along the pier, until they reach its end. the original end has long since collapsed into the sea, but a rickety hand made rope bridge has been affixed to the pier's sheared off edge. eli and solara stand at the pier's end, looking out to sea.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{do you see that?}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{i see it. is that it?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{that's it.}
<A>__{reveal now that the rope bridge leads out across the bay to:}
<B>__{alcatraz island}
<A>__{looking much the same as it always has, old and dilapidated. the coastal fog shrouding it gives it an ethereal look. it feels almost like a mythic place the "promised land" eli has sought for so many years. a tattered stars and stripes still flutters in the breeze atop the prison lighthouse.}
