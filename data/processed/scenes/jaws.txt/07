<A>__{in his shorts, laughing to himself, turning in slow stoned circles, held prisoner by his windbreaker which seems to have him in an armlock, as he struggles to free his arm from a tight sleeve. as he turns, we hear the alma maters in the background, from the fire.}
<L>__{interior brody house bedroom early morning}
<A>__{a shaft of morning sun blasts through the crack between the bottom of the shade and the windowsill, falling across the heads of the sleeping couple on the bed. it catches martin brody right across the eyes, bringing him up from sleep. the job is completed by the clock radio, which clicks on with local fisherman's report and weather.}
