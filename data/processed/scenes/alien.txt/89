<A>__{they all come into the room (roby carrying the partially melted pen). broussard is still motionless on the bunk, with the thing on his face.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{did it get on him?}
<A>__{standard approaches and peers at broussard's head.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{no, thank god... just missed him.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{is it still dripping?}
<C>__{standard}
<P>__{(examining it)}
<D>__{it appears to have healed itself.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{it makes me sick to see him like that.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{isn't there some way we can get it off him?}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{i don't see how. but let's do what we can for him.}
<A>__{standard presses a button, and broussard slides back into the diagnostic coffin. he presses more buttons, and the displays light up again, showing different parts of broussard's body.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{i think we'd better get some intravenous feeding started. god knows what that thing is leaching out of him.}
<A>__{standard operates some controls, and the machine begins to invade broussard's body, sliding needles into him.}
<C>__{roby}
<P>__{(studying the screens)}
<D>__{look there, what's that stain on his lungs?}
<A>__{the x ray reveals a spreading dark blot in the vicinity of broussard's chest. in the center, the stain is completely opaque.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{it appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the x rays...}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{that tube must be depositing it in him.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{could be some kind of venom, or poison...}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{this is horrible.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{hey! what about the film?}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{what film?}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he? we can see what happened to him.}
