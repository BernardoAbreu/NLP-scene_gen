<L>__{interior cloud city corridor day}
<A>__{as luke and artoo move carefully down a deserted corridor, they hear a group of people coming down a side hallway. artoo lets out an excited series of beeps and whistles. luke glares at the tiny droid, who stops in his tracks with a feeble squeak. boba fett enters from a side hallway followed by two guards pushing the floating, encased body of han solo. two stormtroopers, who follow, immediately spot luke and open fire on him. the youth draws his weapon and blasts the two troopers before they can get off a second shot. the two guards whisk han into another hallway as fett lowers his arm and fires a deadly laser at luke, which explodes to one side and tears up a huge chunk of wall. luke rushes to a side hallway, but by the time he reaches it, fett, han, and the guards are gone. a think metal door blocks the passage. luke turns to see leia, chewie, threepio, and lando being herded down a second hallway by several other stormtroopers. leia turns just in time to see luke.}

<A>__{before she can finish, she is pulled through a doorway and disappears from sight. luke races after the group, leaving little artoo trailing behind.}
