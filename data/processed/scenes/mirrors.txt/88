<L>__{exterior night manhattan street nypd police station}
<A>__{under the pouring rain, the police patrol cars come and go in front of the police station. a bit further away we recognize ben's oldsmobile, parked on an adjacent street. ben is waiting inside. a man approaches, knocks on the car window and enters the vehicle. it's larry the rainwater drips down his raincoat. under his arm he holds a file of documents, wrapped in a plastic bag.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{this ought to make you happy...}
<P>__{(handing him the file)}
<D>__{anna esseker...}
<A>__{ben nervously tears open the plastic wrapping }
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{i wasn't quite sure what you needed, so i got all of her medical records.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{perfect, larry. that's perfect.}
<A>__{ben skims through the pages. he cannot believe that he has finally discovered who esseker is...}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{everyone's real edgy up there. you're still a fuckin' murder suspect. people are wondering why i let you out. you have to tell me more. what does the history of the mayflower have to do with the death of your sister?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i don't know exactly. i can't tell you, but some really fucked up things started happening to me when i took the job over there. nothing makes any sense to me either but i have to follow my instinct.}
<A>__{larry notices the broken rear view mirror }
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{what happened? did you have an accident?}
<A>__{ben is too absorbed in the records. he doesn't answer.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{anna esseker... where did you find her files? did you go to city hall?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{no, you were wrong about that, they had nothing. all the medical records from st. john's hospital are still up there with the unclassified cases.}
<A>__{ben squints at him.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{she was a patient at st. john's in the psych ward run by a dr. kane, between march and september 1952. she was only twelve years old when she died...}
<A>__{ben freezes }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{when the nurses went on their rounds, first thing on the morning of october 6th, they discovered that all the patients had left their rooms during the night and gathered in the main room. all of them were dead, including the girl. apparently, they had killed one another... a slaughter house... after that they shut down the place. nobody ever found out what really happened.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what about the doctor? dr. kane?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{he was arrested. they found him dead on the first day of his hearing. he had slit his wrists with a piece of his cell mirror!}
