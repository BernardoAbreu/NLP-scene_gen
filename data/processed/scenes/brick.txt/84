<L>__{1}
<A>__{unfortunately mr. taylor flatly refused, which, given the context, was probably wise. brendan lifts his head painfully. surrounding him in the darkened doorways are dozens of boys, some dressed like tugger, others dressed in black. tug pokes his head out.}
<C>__{tugger}
<D>__{alright.}
<A>__{arms pop out of the darkness and drag brendan towards the lit room.}
<L>__{interior kingpin's den}
<A>__{a small room, amazingly messy. clothes strewn about, groves of empty bottles, precarious piles of books. the overall impression though is not of jumbled chaos, but of a nest, comfortably woven and very worn in. a slim figure with wispy hair sits facing the wall at a small desk, writing under a green bookkeeper's lamp. brendan is shoved into the center of the room. tug and his clones slump against the surrounding walls. brendan watches the thin figure's back. for a beat the only noise is the scratching of the thin man's pencil. then he sighs and swivels around. mid to late twenties. sallow features, tired eyes. his clothes are so richly black it is difficult to make out specific items he is just one inky black mass from the neck down and eyebrows up.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{you the pin?}
<C>__{pin}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(beat of silence)}
<D>__{so now i'm very very curious what you're going to say nexterior}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{maybe i will just sit and bleed at you.}
<A>__{the pin shifts in his seat, bored.}
<C>__{pin}
<D>__{helled if you're gonna go breaking my best clients' noses and expect me to play sandbag. anyway you've been sniffing me out before then, sniffing for me like a vampire bat for a horse with a nick on its ear he can suck on. they do that.}
<P>__{(brendan blinks)}
<D>__{so now you got tugger to bring you here, which he never does, and you got me listening, so i'm curious what you've got to say that better be really, really good.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{call ms. dannon in from the hall first; she oughta hear this.}
<C>__{pin}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{no dice, soldier. would have been a neat trick, though.}
<C>__{brendan}
<P>__{(shrugs, then slowly)}
<D>__{i was going to make up some bit of information or set up some phony deal, anything so you'd let me walk. then i was going to go to the vice principal and spill him the street address of the biggest dope port in the burgh.}
<A>__{the pin's eyes shoot to tugger, who doesn't flinch.}
<C>__{tugger}
<D>__{he knows zippo.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{1250 vista blanca, the ink blotter at the desk in the den in the basement of the house with the tacky mailbox.}
<A>__{the world turns on its side as tugger pushes brendan's head down into the carpet.}
<C>__{tugger}
<D>__{you gonna do what now?!}
<A>__{the pin walks towards them. one of his shoes is twice the size of the other.}
<C>__{pin}
<D>__{no good, soldier.}
<A>__{the cronies around the room begin cackling. tug's face is a mask of rage. brendan can't breath. his face swells.}
<C>__{pin }
<D>__{alright, let up.}
<A>__{but tug doesn't let up. brendan's world grows hazy, the cackling laughter reverberates, then a clean voice pierces the din.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(os)}
<D>__{tug, stop.}
<A>__{tug's face breaks for a moment, and he lets go. brendan's head lolls to the side. laura stands in the dark doorway. brendan sees tug's knuckles and a flash of white for a split moment as tug hits him in the face. the pin's black body spills out across the frame, leaving us in black.}
