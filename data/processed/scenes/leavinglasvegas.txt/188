<L>__{interior motel room day}
<A>__{ben mixes a cocktail for himself, then one for sera. the camera follows him as he goes...}
<L>__{exterior pool side day}
<A>__{... to the side of the pool, where sera is sunbathing. he lowers himself unsteadily into the chair but avoids spilling a drop of the drinks, which he puts down on to a glass topped table. he is pretty loaded. sera turns over and moves out of his shadow.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{i've missed the best sun. why did you have to pawn your watch?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i didn't know i'd ever need it again.}
<A>__{sera gets up, takes a drink and then walks to the diving board. as she takes a position at the end, she pulls the bathing suit out from her bottom, does a very natural dive into the pool, swims a length under water and then comes out near ben, pulls herself out of the pool in one move and bends down and kisses ben for a long time. ben responds and kisses back. there is no one else around the pool. the kiss becomes heated and urgent and sera sits on ben, making him wet from her. he pushes the top of her suit down and kisses her breasts. she picks up the glass and drinks, letting the alcohol spill from her mouth, over her breasts. ben drinks from her.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{take this off.}
<A>__{he tries to pull her swimsuit down.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{maybe we should go inside. come on.}
<A>__{she stands up, covering herself. ben stands up, laughing, loses his balance and slips on the wet concrete. he falls backwards, half on to the chair, which he breaks, and then on to the glass table. the table goes over and it and the glasses all shatter on the concrete. ben falls on the broken glass and cuts himself all over his back and his arms. glass goes into the pool. blood mingles with the water on the steaming cement.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{whoops.}
<A>__{sera picks up her towel and lays it down next to him. she kneels and helps him up, trying to pullout the little bits of glass sticking to him. ben stands unsteadily.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i will go and clean up. perhaps you could take care of this.}
<A>__{he indicates the mess, then walks to their room. sera begins carefully picking up the broken glass. the desk clerc appears with a broom and a dustpan.}
<D>__{desk clerk}
<P>__{(cheerfully)}
<D>__{everybody ok?}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{yes, fine. don't worry. we'll pay for the chair, and i will clean all this up, the pool too. desk clerk don't worry.}
<A>__{he begins sweeping the broken glass into the pan, cheerfully ignoring sera.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{you seem prepared for accidents. desk clerk}
<P>__{(still smiling)}
<D>__{yeah... we get a lot of screw ups here.}
<A>__{he looks directly at sera.}
<D>__{desk clerk now, you two keep you loud talk and your liquor to your room. check out first thing tomorrow and after that i don't want to see either of you here again. i don't need you paying for the chair or cutting your pretty hands on the glass. let's leave it at that.}
<A>__{nodding firmly, he goes back to the mess, indicating that the conversation is over.}
<D>__{desk clerk see ya in the morning.}
