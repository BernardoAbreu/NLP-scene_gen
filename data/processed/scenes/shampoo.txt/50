<L>__{interior bistro lester and felicia}
<C>__{felicia}
<P>__{(she laughs)}
<D>__{ think what you have time to think, lester.}
<A>__{lester grabs her.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{what are you talking about, felicia?}
<A>__{suddenly there's a rumble in the room and east has stopped chanting. several men have stepped to the center of the room. one of them in a slate suit raising both hands.}
<C>__{det. younger}
<D>__{excuse me, senator. ladies and gentlemen, we're going to have to evacuate this room as quietly and quickly as possible. there's nothing to worry about. we'd like you to exit through the door here on my left... down the steps into the street, please!}
<A>__{there are whisperings and rumblings of 'a bomb' and rejoinders to the effect that it's a hoax. nevertheless the exodus begins and grows to bedlam. waiters who had been fawning over jeweled ladies are now unceremoniously pushing them down the stairs, even going over them to make the entrance.}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{the emergency doesn't keep autograph hounds from inhibiting the exit as they try to hold up celebrities in the crowd that flows onto the street. jill and johnny pope are caught up in the swirl of the crowd. pope temporarily loses jill. he looks around. jill taps him on the shoulder.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{ here i am. now what?}
<A>__{pope turns.}
<C>__{pope}
<D>__{well as i see it we've got two choices. we can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{let's do that.}
<A>__{lester is with some security people, trying to find out what they're doing. b.g. are several police cars, a fire truck, and the fire truck ambulance. lights are flashing.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{ have they located it?}
<A>__{somebody shrugs. a car honks. lester is pulled to the side.}
<C>__{lester }
<P>__{(looking toward driver)}
<D>__{ oh, sorry.}
<A>__{then he sees it's felicia. she gives him the finger, and lays rubber nearly sideswiping him.}
<C>__{one of the security men}
<D>__{what was that all about?}
<A>__{somebody else says 'who was that?' lester shrugs.}
