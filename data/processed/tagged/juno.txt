<C>__{leah}
<D>__{oh, gruesome. i wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i'm staying pregnant, le.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. she doesn't know we're sexually active.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{what does that even mean? anyway, i got to thinking on the way over. i was thinking maybe i could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. you know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. or some nice lesbos.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{but then you'll get huge. your chest is going to milktate. and you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i know. maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to cabo san lucas for spring break.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{bleeker and i were going to go to gettysburg for spring break.}
<A>__{leah sighs, as if there's no helping her nerdy friend.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. i see them all the time in the penny saver.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{there are ads? for parents?}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{oh yeah! "desperately seeking spawn." they're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. it's totally legit.}
<C>__{juno}

<D>__{yeah, but it sucks for free.}

<C>__{leah}
<D>__{you're not listening to me.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{no, i heard you. i just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." i'm looking for something a little edgier.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{what did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i was thinking a graphic designer, mid thirties, and his cool asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. but i'm trying to not be too particular.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{all right, how about this one? "healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. you will be compensated. help us complete the circle of love."}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{yeesh, they sound like a cult. besides, they're greedy bitches. they already have three kids!}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{hey, juno. juno! look at this one.}
<A>__{she points to the paper and motions for juno to look. juno scans the ad silently. we see the ad. it contains a photo of an attractive couple with ambiguous mona lisa smiles. it reads "educated, successful couple wishes to..."}

<D>__{hey bleeker! spank off to this with motion lotion. just kidding (kind of.) your best friend, juno.}
<A>__{bleeker picks up the phone. it's the same hamburger phone juno has. he reconsiders and puts it down. there's a knock on the bedroom door. bleeker's mom pokes her dowdy head inside.}

<C>__{bren}
<D>__{first things first, we have to get you healthy. you need prenatal vitamins. incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. find out where you're going to deliver.}

<D>__{the term "deliver" is so weird. can we not say "deliver"?}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{how does "crap it out" sound?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{juno, i want to come with you to meet these adoption people. you're just a kid. i don't want you to get ripped off by a couple of babystarved wingnuts.}

<C>__{mac}
<D>__{just tell it to me straight, bren. do you think this is my fault? her mother's fault?}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{i think kids get bored and have intercourse. and i think junebug was a dummy about it. but we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i'm not ready to be a pop pop.}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{you're not going to be a pop pop. and juno's not going to be a ma. somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. i friggin' hope.}
<C>__{mac}
<P>__{(conspiratorially)}
<D>__{did you see it coming when she sat us down here?}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{oh god yeah. but i was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{that was my first instinct too. or d.w.i. anything but this. and i'm going to punch that bleeker kid in the weiner the next time i see him.}

<D>__{the tough part's almost over for you. i mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.}

<C>__{gerta}
<D>__{mark and vanessa are willing to negotiate an open adoption.}
<C>__{mac}
<P>__{(protective)}
<D>__{wait. what does that mean?}
<C>__{gerta}
<D>__{it means they'd send annual updates, photos, let juno know how the baby is doing as he or she grows up. of course, juno's legal rights would be terminated...}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{whoah. i don't want to see pictures. i don't need to be notified of anything. can't we just kick it old school? i could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. you know, like moses in the reeds.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{technically, that would be kickin' it old testament.}
<A>__{mark and juno lock eyes.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{yeah. yeah! the way people used to do it. quick and dirty, like ripping off a band aid.}
<C>__{gerta}
<D>__{well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{shit, yeah. close it up.}
<A>__{vanessa is clearly ecstatic.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.}

<D>__{are you looking for any other compensation?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{well, no... i'm not going to sell the baby. i just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. i'm in high school, dude. i'm ill equipped.}

<A>__{mac casts a subtle, dubious glance at mark.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{can i use the facilities first? being pregnant makes you pee like seabiscuit.}
<C>__{vanessa}

<D>__{what? no! do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. i could be a total klepto, for all you know.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i don't get a klepto vibe from you. evil genius? maybe. arsonist? wouldn't rule it out.}

<D>__{my dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with greek and roman mythology. he named me after zeus's wife. i mean, zeus had other lays, but i'm pretty sure juno was his only wife. she was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. like diana ross.}

<C>__{juno }
<D>__{it ended with a chair.}
<A>__{we pan past the wall vanessa had said "needed something." there's a framed note on the wall. it looks like it was handwritten on the back of a jiffy lube bill. we see that it says: "vanessa if you're still in, i'm still in. juno." we move to the door and get a view of vanessa's bedroom. we see her lying in bed with a burp cloth draped over her shoulder, feeding the baby. for the first time ever, vanessa looks disorganized, unshowered and incredibly happy. there are formula bottles on the bedside table and a bassinet pushed close to the bed. obviously, she hasn't been away from the baby for a single moment. the baby reaches up and grabs vanessa's thumb. vanessa glows with an expression of pure bliss.}
<L>__{exterior macguff house day}
<A>__{it's a sparkling summer afternoon. juno wheels her bicycle out of the detached garage. she waves goodbye to bren, who is playing in the yard with two weimaraners. she looks almost as happy with her dogs as vanessa looked with her baby.}
<L>__{exterior suburban streets day}
<A>__{juno rides her bike aggressively down the street. her guitar is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag. she's obviously not pregnant anymore. she looks happy, but older.}
<C>__{juno }
<D>__{as boyfriends go, paulie bleeker is totally boss. he is the cheese to my macaroni. i know people are supposed to fall in love before they reproduce, but normalcy's not really our style.}
<A>__{as she tears recklessly down the street on her bikes, she passes the dancing elk track team, still running in outrageously skimpy shorts and bandanas. juno rides up to a garage where bleeker is sitting, tuning his guitar.}
<L>__{exterior bleeker house day}
<A>__{juno bikes up to find bleeker sitting on the stoop. she smiles and takes out her guitar. she sits across from bleeker and pulls the pick out of the strings.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{ready?}
<A>__{bleeker nods. juno begins strumming her guitar and playing "anyone else but you," by the moldy peaches. bleeker joins in. at first their playing is discordant, but suddenly it works.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{you're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. the monkey on your back is the latest trend. i don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{here is the church and here is the steeple. we sure are cute for two ugly people. i don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{we both have shiny happy fits of rage. you want more fans, i want more stage. i don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{you are always trying to keep it real. i'm in love with how you feel. i don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{i kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. i kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. i don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{the pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. so why can't you forgive me? i don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.}
<C>__{juno and bleeker together}
<D>__{du du du du du du dudu. du du du du du du dudu. i don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.}
<A>__{she and bleeker exchange glances as they play. they smile ambiguously. juno leans over and kisses bleeker on the cheek. pull out to reveal the surrounding green suburb buzzing with life and summer activity.}
<T>__{fade to black:}
<C>__{the end}
