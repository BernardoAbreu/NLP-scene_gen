<L>__{interior the king's bedchamber night}
<A>__{louis reaches the bottom of the stairs, disguised behind a similar wardrobe in his own bedroom. he steps out and is startled as the lifesize portrait of louis xiii on the other side of the room opens to admit d'artagnan.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{aaa! d'artagnan! these passages were constructed for the king's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{it is for your security that i have come, your majesty for the security of your honor.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i already know about the riots, d'artagnan, i heard them out there whispering. some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food. i will deal with it tomorrow.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{a personal nature?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{mademoiselle michelle beaufort. she is betrothed to raoul, the son of athos the musketeer, who has served france through many tribulations.}
<A>__{the king begins to eat from the food laid out on the table.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{betrothed? i think not.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{in his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers. she had written him many letters of love.}
<A>__{the king pokes at his food.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{miss beaufort has accepted our invitation. by this we can only suppose that she wishes to come as we wish her to be here.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{your majesty has had many women }
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{that is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{it is not raoul's heart alone that concerns me. it is yours. i know you find women compliant especially the poorer ones like michelle. but do they love you? do you love them? what about a queen to love? a son of your own?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what quaint notions, d'artagnan! but they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{there is more to love than he knew, or that you know.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you dare criticize my father?! or lecture me?!}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{not criticize plead. love. love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry. love women, and they will love you. love yourself, and }
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{that is enough! you are a good servant, d'artagnan, but you forget your place!}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{at least help raoul.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{silence! i order you!}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{order fromberge to keep him in safety! it is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i will consider it. now leave me.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{thank you, your majesty.}
<A>__{d'artagnan bows, steps to the lifesize portrait of louis xiii, touches a hidden button on its frame and moves into the secret passage the painting reveals as it swings open.}
