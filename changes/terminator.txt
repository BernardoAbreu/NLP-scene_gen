<LOC>__{EXT. SCHOOLYARD - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Silence.  Gradually the sound of distant traffic becomes audible.  A LOW ANGLE bounded on one side by a chain-link fence and on the other by the one-story public school build- ings.  Spray-can hieroglyphics and distant streetlight sha- dows.  This is a Los Angeles public school in a blue collar neighborhood. ANGLE BETWEEN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, where a trash dumpster looms in a LOW ANGLE, part of the clutter behind the gymnasium. A CAT enters FRAME.  CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD, prowling with him through the landscape of trash receptacles and shadows. CLOSE ON CAT, which freezes, alert, sensing something just beyond human perception. A sourceless wind rises, and with it a keening WHINE. Papers blow across the pavement. The cat YOWLS and hides under the dumpster. Windows rattle in their frames. The WHINE intensifies, accompanied now by a wash of frigid PURPLE LIGHT.  A CONCUSSION like a thunderclap right over- head blows in all the windows facing the yard. C.U. - CAT, its eyes are wide as the glare dies.}

<ACTION>__{SLOW PAN as the sound of stray electrical CRACKLING subsides. FRAME comes to rest on the figure of a NAKED MAN kneeling, faced away, in the previously empty yard. He stands, slowly. The man is in his late thirties, tall and powerfully built, moving with graceful precision. C.U. - MAN, his facial features reiterate the power of his body and are dominated by the eyes, which are intense, blue and depthless.  His hair is military short. This man is the TERMINATOR. He glances down, taking calm inventory of himself, and notices that a fine white ash covers his skin.  He brushes at it unconcernedly as he walks toward the fence, scanning his surroundings.}

The school is perched at the edge of a pro- montory offering a respectable view of the urban sprawl teem- ing and glistening under a sullen sky.  The night clouds are shot through with occasional flashes of LIGHTNING, presaging a thunderstorm. Terminator stands, hands on hips in prefect symmetry, gazing down at the city as the CAMERA REACHES FULL HEIGHT.}

<ACTION>__{Without warning Terminator hammer-punches him in the temple with blinding speed.  The blow flings him with a CLANG into the jungle gym.  He drops to the ground in a still heap, eyes open, twitching. The leader whips out his SWITCHBLADE and slashes in one motion.  Terminator ducks back and catches the knife- wielder's wrist in an inhuman grip.  Then he punches the leader with piledriver force just below the breastbone. ANGLE - PAVEMENT, as the knife clatters down.  The punk's combat boots are on tiptoe, barely touching the ground. ANGLE - TWO SHOT, Terminator and the leader are close together as if dancing, but motionless.  Their bodies are in total shadow.  The punk's eyes are wide, his veins distended with an agonizing pressure.  Terminator jerks his fist back with a WET SOUND and the other drops OUT OF FRAME. The last tough is stumbling away, gaping with terror.  He backs into a chainlink fence, turns to run along it, finds he is in a corner. Terminator takes a step toward him, his gaze ominous. The punk begins shakily stripping off his clothes. Thunder peals overhead.}

SLOW PAN AND DOLLY into the mouth of a narrow alley lined with trash containers and fire escapes.  From a recessed doorway, two filthy legs sprawl out onto the wet pavement. An angry, inarticulate DRUNKARD'S MONOLOGUE rises occasionally above the rain sounds. ANGLE - DOORWAY,  The derelict rouses from his bitter stupor as a brilliant purple glare lights up the wet brickwork around him.  A shockwave hurls trash into the air. Painted over windows shatter. Rat scurry, blinded. A FIGURE drops INTO FRAME as if out of the sky and smacks the pavement with a muddy splash. C.U. - DERELICT, as he blinks at the fading glare, amazed. A NAKED MAN, compact and muscular, rises in a defensive crouch.  KYLE REESE is 22, but his face has been aged by ordeal, the mouth hard, eyes grim.  A crinkled burn scar traverses one side of his face from chin to forehead.  Other scars, from burns and bullets, mar his hard-muscled body. The rain washes a fine coating of white ash from his skin as electrical ARCS lace back and forth between the fire escapes behind him, HISSING and SPUTTERING.  The sound fades, then stops altogether, to be replaced by a rising scream of animal agony. Reese lurches to his feet and sprints across the alley.}

<ACTION>__{CAMERA MOVES WITH REESE as he leaps to the fire escape and clambers up to the first landing to crouch beside another NAKED MAN who appears to be entangled in the ironwork.  The man is contorted with pain as his screams die to a shivering gasp.  CLOSER ANGLE reveals that he has been skewered through the abdomen by the horizontal iron slats and through the shoulder by a railing.  He has materialized in the same space occupied by the fire escape structure.  The figure slumps, motionless. Reese quickly checks for signs of life.  The man is dead. Reese descend to the alley floor and crosses to the drunk huddled in the doorway. A pair of flamboyantly dressed women, obviously working girls, passes by the alley mouth.  They do a double take when they see Reese, but walk on without breaking stride, completely jaded.  He's certainly not a potential customer. Reese crouches down as if to speak to the drunk.}

C.U. - REESE, CAMERA hugging him as he sprints and turns, alternately front-lit, side-lit and silhouetted as the electric glare of the city wheels about him. ANGLE - ALLEY MOUTH, Reese flashes though intermittent cross-lighting in the B.G. Another unit arrives out front and Reese melts back into the alley, only to see a cop round the corner behind him. Sandwiched.  Reese crashes into a steel door, rending the lock, and vanishes into the darkness within. The newly arrived cops are a K-9 unit.

As the light passes, Reese silently moves on. ANGLE - COP, passing the end of a long aisle B.G. while in the F.G. a hand ENTERS FRAME, removing a knit shirt from a hanger.

C.U. - DOBERMAN, suddenly on its back and held by the throat, THE DOG YELPS and stares at Reese, who leans very close. Inches from its eyes he fixes it with a gaze of uncompromis- ing dominance.
