<L>__{interior michael's loft evening}
<A>__{jacob charges into the dark space groping for a light. he finds it. the loft is a disaster area. nothing is standing. jacob runs from room to room. in the back he discovers a large private chemistry lab. glass vials and bottles are shattered on the floor. jacob rifles through the cabinets. a few bottles are intact but their labels mean nothing to him. he reaches for one cabinet and notices a reddish liquid oozing out from the bottom. he opens it. michael's severed head stares him in the face. it is smiling. a scream rings out as the man from upstairs sees what jacob has seen. jacob jumps back, trips, and falls over michael's headless body. it is lying sprawled across the floor.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{oh my god!}
<A>__{jacob stumbles to pull himself up. he is in a state of unrelieved panic. he runs past the man and spills out the doorr. he takes two and three stairs at a time, nearly flying to the street.}
