<L>__{interior hotel room libya day}
<A>__{the bellboy enters with ramirez, sets down his bags and then opens the shutters of the window. ramirez tips him silently. once the bellboy has left, ramirez walks to the phone and checks it out. then he crosses to the shutters. perhaps he sees a shadow looking in his direction from the dark apartment across the street. he closes the shutters. just then, there's a loud knock on the door. he jumps and automatically goes for his gun. but he has no gun... and his heart begins to pound again. the loud knock repeats itself.}

<D>__{sir...?}
<A>__{ramirez carefully opens the door. in walks a young, rather innocent looking waiter with a jar of ice water. he wears a fez on his head. as he places it on a table, ramirez eyes him with suspicion. suddenly the waiter reaches underneath his jacket and... pulls out a small handgun.}
<B>__{on ramirez}
<A>__{he is frozen with fear.}
<B>__{on waiter}
<A>__{putting his finger to his mouth to signal silence, he shoves the gun and silencer under a napkin. then he takes off his fez and from within, pulls out a small grenade and extra clip of ammunition. without any further attempt at communication, he exits the room.}

<D>__{jesus.}
<A>__{ramirez walks back into the bathroom. he splashes water on his face and takes three deep breaths and then slowly looks up into the mirror... and finds carlos.}
