<L>__{interior buckingham palace breakfast room day}
<A>__{the queen sits at breakfast. reading the newspapers. dogs under the table. a knock on the door, and robin janvrin, (40's), her deputy private secretary, pops around..}
<C>__{janvrin}
<D>__{the prime minister is on his way, ma'am.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{to be, robin.}
<P>__{(correcting, terse)}
<D>__{prime minister to be.}
<A>__{the queen frostily flicks a page, without looking up..}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{he hasn't asked my permission yet.}
<L>__{interior buckingham palace corridor day}
<A>__{the queen and janvrin walk through a corridor of the palace. it has the air of a grand hotel. chintz. flock. long, gilded mirrors. portraits on the walls..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{he's a hard one to read, isn't he?}
<C>__{janvrin}
<D>__{yes. on the one hand his background is quite establishment. father a conservative. a public school education at fettes, where he was tutored by the same man as the prince of wales.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{well, we'll try not to hold that against him.}
<C>__{janvrin}
<D>__{on the other, his manifesto promises the most radical modernisation and shake up of the constitution in three hundred years.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{oh. is he going to `modernise' us, do you think?}
<C>__{janvrin}
<D>__{i wouldn't put it past him. he's married to a woman with known anti monarchist sympathies you may remember her curtsey the first time you met. it could best be described as `shallow'.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i don't measure the depth of a curtsey, robin. i leave that to my sister.}
<C>__{janvrin}
<D>__{and i spoke to the cabinet secretary who said he was expecting the atmosphere at downing street to be very informal. everyone on first name terms.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{at the prime minister's insistence.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{what? as in `call me tony?'}
<C>__{janvrin}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{the queen's face puckers in distaste..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{oh. i'm not sure i like the sound of that.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{have we sent him a protocol sheet?}
