<L>__{exterior dinelli's cafe, piazza di spagna. morning.}
<A>__{meredith sits waiting in a cafe at the bottom of the spanish steps. ripley, dressed as ripley, is at the top of the steps, among early tourists, watching as she drinks her coffee at an outside table. then marge and peter appear walking up the via condotti, head for another table, don't see meredith. she acknowledges peter who hasn't noticed her.}
<C>__{meredith}
<D>__{peter? hello, it's meredith logue.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{of course it is, meredith, hello, i'm sorry, half asleep, how are you? this is marge sherwood. meredith logue.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{hearing marge's name meredith reacts, freezes.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{join us, won't you? we're just waiting for a friend. do you know, i wonder did we see you at the opera last night?}
<C>__{meredith}
<D>__{i won't actually, although i think this might are you waiting for dickie?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well no, as it happens, although...}
<C>__{marge}
<P>__{(stunned at the mention of his name)}
<D>__{dickie? do you know dickie?}
<C>__{meredith}
<D>__{you were at the opera? well, that explains yes i was there. i was there with dickie.}
<C>__{marge}
<P>__{(to peter)}
<D>__{i told you! i knew it!}
<C>__{meredith}
<P>__{(moving over to them)}
<D>__{marge, i don't know you, so i have no right, but dickie loves you. he's i think you'll find he's coming home to you.}
<C>__{marge}
<P>__{(proprietorial)}
<D>__{how would you know that?}
<C>__{meredith}
<D>__{he told me everything. i was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so i...i'm going to go now, i think. unless he meant us to meet which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{no, we're meeting another friend. tom ripley.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{do you know tom?}
<C>__{meredith}
<D>__{ripley? no. i heard about him, of course, but no, i didn't meet him.}
<A>__{the waiter has arrived to take orders. meredith indicates she's leaving.}
<C>__{meredith }
<D>__{not for me. no, grazie.}
<A>__{marge is on the edge. peter lays a hand to comfort her.}
<C>__{meredith }
<D>__{i hope i didn't complicate matters, but nothing, nothing untoward happened, nothing to prevent you from welcoming him back, from marrying him...goodbye. goodbye peter, please don't get up.}
<A>__{peter gets up. ripley, from his vantage point at the top of the steps, watches meredith leave and walk off into the crowd. he begins the slow walk down towards the square. as he becomes visible to the cafe, he starts to hurry. he's apologising to marge and peter as they see him, in his element, lying and believing in his lie.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{sorry, sorry. had to renew my papers. italian bureaucracy never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. have you been waiting long?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{not at all. morning tom.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{hi.}
<P>__{(to marge)}
<D>__{sorry. you okay? you look as if you've seen a ghost...}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{dickie was at the opera last night.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i don't believe it. wild horses wouldn't drag dickie to }
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{he was there with someone. so i suppose she must have dragged him that's not fair. i'm going back to mongi. i think dickie's coming home.}
<P>__{(to peter)}
<D>__{i'm going to go home.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{really? that's swell. no, i was just you're way ahead of me! great!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{we think he's had a change of heart.}
<P>__{(to marge)}
<D>__{so we should be celebrating.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{i hope so.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(to marge)}
<D>__{that was moving, wasn't it? when meredith said }
<P>__{(to ripley)}
<D>__{meredith's the american girl i saw last night, i know her, at the opera, she's been seeing something of dickie }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{my god.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{but the point is dickie well we know this dickie loves marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{it's fantastic.}
<P>__{(to peter)}
<D>__{i feel guilty. marge doesn't understand this, but anytime dickie does something i feel guilty.}
