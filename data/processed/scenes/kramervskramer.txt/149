<L>__{interior back room}
<A>__{ted's pov joanna she sits against the wall, a glass of white wine in front of her. she is dressed simply and no longer has a tan. nevertheless, joanna is still stunningly beautiful. hold on her for a beat as she looks up, smiles.}
<B>__{on ted}
<A>__{he stands watching her, his knees weak. it is impossible not to fall in love with her all over again.}
<B>__{two shot}
<A>__{as he crosses to her table, sits down.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{hello, ted. you look well.}

<A>__{the waiter nods and promptly disappears.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{how's the new job?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{there is a self conscious pause. from the bar, the piano player begins playing a new song. from ted and joanna's reaction, it is clearly a song that has meant a great deal to them in the past. they listen for a moment, then:}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{look at us, joanna. just like any old married couple having dinner. who would believe it.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{yes... how's billy?}

<C>__{ted}
<D>__{he's great... except...}
<P>__{(not looking at her)}
<D>__{...except he had... he fell and he cut his face. he... he has a scar, joanna, from about here to here.}
<P>__{(indicating where and how big)}
<A>__{there is a beat of silence. a moment of shared feeling.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(he has to say it to someone)}
<D>__{i can't help but feel somehow... it's my fault. i keep thinking i could've done something stopped it...}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{you can't tell it from a distance, ted.}
<A>__{for the first time he looks up at her.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{cross cutting between them:}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{i've seen him.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you have?}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{a few times. sometimes i sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school.}
<B>__{on ted}
<A>__{speechless.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{he looks like a terrific kid.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{he is...}
<P>__{(he still can't get over it)}
<D>__{you sat in that coffee shop across from school}
<C>__{joanna}
<P>__{(completing the sentence)}
<D>__{watching my son... ted, i've been living in new york for the past two months.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{you've been living here, in the city?}
<C>__{joanna}
<P>__{(a deep breath)}
<D>__{ted... the reason i wanted to see you... i want billy back.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you want what?!}
<C>__{joanna}
<P>__{(firm)}
<D>__{i want my son. i'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. i want my son.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{are you out of your mind?! you're the one that walked out on him, remember?}
<C>__{joanna}
<P>__{(trying to explain)}
<D>__{ted, listen to me... you and i, we had a really crappy marriage}
<P>__{(hastily)}
<D>__{look, don't get so defensive, okay? it was probably as much my fault as it was yours... anyway when i left i was really screwed up}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{joanna, i don't give a}
<C>__{joanna}
<P>__{(she will be heard)}
<D>__{ted, all my life i'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. then all of a sudden, i was a thirty two year old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child. i went to california because that was about as far away as i could get. only... i guess it wasn't far enough. so i started going to a shrink.}
<P>__{(leaning forward, very sincere)}
<D>__{ted, i've had time to think. i've been through some changes. i've learned a lot about myself.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(like a shot)}
<D>__{such as?}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(boring in)}
<D>__{come on, joanna, what did you learn? i'd really like to know.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(relentless)}
<D>__{one thing, okay? just tell me one goddam thing you've learned.}
<A>__{there is a beat of silence, then:}
<C>__{joanna}
<P>__{(quiet, determined)}
<D>__{i've learned that i want my son.}
<B>__{on ted}
<A>__{he reacts as though he has been slapped.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{joanna, go be a mother. get married, have kids. don't get married, have kids. do whatever you want. i don't give a damn. just leave me out of it and leave my baby out of it.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{ted, if you can't discuss this rationally }
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(getting to his feet)}
<D>__{joanna, go fuck yourself!}
<A>__{and with that he turns on his heels and stalks out of the restaurant.}
