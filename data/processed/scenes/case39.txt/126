<A>__{emily throws the suitcase in the trunk. slams it shut. comes around to the driver's side door. jumps in. closes the door. and gets the scare of her life. lucy is sitting in the passenger seat! emily recoils with a scream, throwing her body against the window behind her. lucy sits there, silent, betrayed. it's too much for emily. she breaks down. buries her face in her hands and sobs. lucy, after a moment, takes a brush from emily's bag and starts lovingly brushing her hair. emily slowly lifts her head, resigning herself to this latest horror. she sits zombie like behind the wheel, tears streaming as lucy tugs gently at the snarls, playing mommy.}
