<L>__{exterior anna and dillon jungle day}
<A>__{have fallen behind, dillon looking worriedly ahead at the them out distancing them. anna is keeping her pace purposefully slow. she trips on a root falling to the ground. she lies there, motionless. he quickly reaches down to haul her to her feet. revised "hunter" 4 29 86}
<C>__{dillon}
<P>__{(urgently)}
<D>__{shit. come on...}
<A>__{like an uncoiled spring, anna turns, flinging a handful of dirt into his face, momentarily blinding him. she lunges for his rifle with her bound hands. suddenly the barrel of an mp 5 is thrust into her face. looking up she sees ramirez, calmly holding the weapon on her, the look in his eyes indicating he'd hove no trouble shooting her.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{don't try it.}
<A>__{she looks back at dillon, wiping the dirt from his eyes. she moves on. ramirez gives him a cold look as dillon hurries past.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<P>__{(coolly)}
<D>__{you should put her on a leash, agent man. if you can't handle her, just say the word.}
<A>__{dillon moves on, ignoring ramirez, who turns, scanning the jungle behind him before moving on. dillon catches up with anna, turning her sharply by the chin.}
<C>__{dillon}
<P>__{(cold; in spanish)}
<D>__{try that again. please.}
<A>__{she looks at him contemptuously, undaunted. she will try it again. she breaks away from his grasp and moves on, dillon watching her go, he won't hesitate next time.}
