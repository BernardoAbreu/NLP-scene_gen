<D>__{oh, claire...would you ever consider dating a guy like this?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{can't you just leave me alone?}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{i mean if he had a great personality and was a good dancer and had a cool car...although you'd probably have to ride in the back seat 'cause his nuts would ride shotgun.}

<C>__{bender}
<D>__{were you or were you not motioning to claire?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{yeah, but it was only...was only because i didn't want her to know that i was a virgin, okay? bender just stares at him.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{excuse me for being a virgin, i'm sorry... claire laughs.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{why didn't you want me to know you were a virgin?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{because it's personal business, it's my personal, private business.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{well brian, it doesn't sound like you're doing any business...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i think it's okay for a guy to be a virgin... bender looks suprised.}
