<L>__{exterior sebastian's apartment}
<A>__{a district of silence and ruin. the street is strewn with refuse. the building looks vacant. a ten storey condo gone to shit. the vandals have come and gone long ago. sebastian's little white ambulance parked at the curb. mr. deetchum, the old watchman, sitting in the building entry in a straight backed chair, is reading a comic book.}
<L>__{interior sebastian's apartment night}
<A>__{well stocked with items of survival, all labeled and stacked. and shelved along the walls and hung from the ceiling is a menagerie of animoids. like so many broken toys awaiting resurrection from sebastian's wise hands. sebastian is seated at a large work table, bent over a stereo scope. the tool in his right hand is a sensor probe and he's using it with the delicacy of an en graver. the object of his concentration is a maze like chip configuration no bigger than a thumbnail, but magnified under the scope, it looks like an aerial view of a large city. the needle like sensor probe moves care fully over the contours of the configuration, testing the bonds. suddenly a blue flash erupts from one of the junctures.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{oh!}
<A>__{pris is light on her feet. she's standing behind him with a half eaten sandwich in her hand.}
<C>__{pris}
<D>__{whatcha doin'?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{you scared me.}
<A>__{but he's happy to see her.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i'm working.}
<A>__{she's changed her dress and made up her face. looks a little older and sexier.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{you look... better.}
<C>__{pris}
<D>__{just better.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{beautiful.}
<C>__{pris}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{he watches her as she prowls around the room, looking at this and that, eating her sandwich.}
<C>__{pris}
<D>__{and you live in this building all by yourself?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{yeah, i live here pretty much alone right now...}
<A>__{trying to make light of it.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{no housing shortage around here... plenty of room for everybody.}
<A>__{she sprawls on the couch studying him.}
<C>__{pris}
<D>__{how old are you?}
<A>__{he can't meet her eyes.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{twenty.}
<C>__{pris}
<D>__{what's your problem?}
<A>__{it's not an easy subject. his voice is barely audible.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{methuselah syndrome.}
<C>__{pris}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{my glands. they grow old too fast.}
<C>__{pris}
<D>__{is that why you're still here?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{yes. i couldn't pass the test.}
<A>__{there is a silence. he steals a glance at her.}
<C>__{pris}
<D>__{i like you just the way you are.}
<A>__{under the desk he bats his knees together.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{ah, you get hold of your friends?}
<C>__{pris}
<D>__{as a matter of fact i did. they've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{the implications catch up.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i can sleep on the couch.}
<A>__{a little gray mouse on the shelf above his head bobs up.}
<C>__{mouse}
<D>__{don't let the bed bugs bite!}
<A>__{taking their cue from the mouse, some of the more talented animoids toot, flap and wheel about.}
