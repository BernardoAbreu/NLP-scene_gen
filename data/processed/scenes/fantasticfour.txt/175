<C>__{sue}
<D>__{a gasket? reed, we're at a party.}
<A>__{he opens his hand, revealing a circular piece of metal, just about the size of......a ring. sue slows down.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{if one of us were to wear it...}
<A>__{she sees johnny and ben inside, watching in on a secret. reed looks her square in the eye. unflinching.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{reed. what are you doing?}
<A>__{reed drops to his knees. his head stays eye level, while his body drops. sue gapes, so emotional she starts to disappear.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{no more thinking, no more variables... sue storm...will you...}
<P>__{(she's gone)}
<D>__{sue? sue? you there?}
<A>__{dead silence. and then...}

<D>__{clear the way, wide load coming through.}
<A>__{ben glares, fists clenched. johnny smiles, mischievous, as they hit the balcony. and he flames on, taking off into the air, blazing the number "four" enclosed in a circle of flame (their future callsign), over the city skyline. the crowd oohs and aahs. ben watches, unimpressed.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{showoff.}
<A>__{people drink, laugh, dance. we slowly pull back from the party, the boat, the city, and...cut to : }
