<L>__{exterior county building day}
<A>__{small townish; old adobe and stucco walls, cannon on the front lawn, every door loudly declaring itself a department: social services, courts, and, sheriff.}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{the sheriff's personal office is turn of the century regal, with high beam ceilings and rotating fans. nothing seems newer than 1940, including the coffee pot the sheriff pours a mugful from. trim with glasses, bolo tie and boots, he looks like barry goldwater.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{and to what do i owe the thrill of a visit from a so cal homicide cop?}
<A>__{he hands the coffee to thomas, sitting in a chair beside his solid oak desk.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{run of of the mill psycho killer body dismemberment on our end. the usual.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{lovely place, los angeles.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{got a lead i wanted to run down chimney rock way. thought i'd do the courtesy of telling you first.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{big of you.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{you're welcome to put a babysitter on me if you like.}
<A>__{the sheriff smiles.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{son, this is the third biggest county in the country, not even counting the 25,000 square mile indian reservation right next door, and i've got fewer men than just one of your little palm tree precincts to cover all of it. 'fraid the only help you're gonna get from me, short of another shoot out at the ok corral, is that cup of coffee in your hand. a middle aged secretary enters with a stack of paper.}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{here's the last week's watch reports.}
<A>__{she hands them to the sheriff, who passes them on to thomas. he flips through the stack, comes up with nothing. the secretary hands another, single sheet to the sheriff.}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{bobby just called this in from chimney rock.}
<A>__{thomas perks at the town's name.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<P>__{(to thomas)}
<D>__{sent a car up there this morning. teacher complained some vagrant was sleeping in her schoolhouse.}
<A>__{the sheriff's brow crinkles in consternation as he reads further.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<P>__{(to secretary)}
<D>__{damn it, get bobby on the phone, clarice. what the hell is this suppose to be?}
<C>__{daggett}
<P>__{(re report)}
<D>__{may i?}
<A>__{the sheriff hands it to him. glancing at it we pick up words like burned, black slick, body outline. thomas copies the name of the school down, gulps his coffee, and shakes the sheriff's hand.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{thanks for the coffee.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<P>__{(as thomas turns to leave)}
<D>__{small piece of advice, lt. dagget, that i give free of charge to all visiting big city policemen: it's wild country up there. always has been, always will be. you come across anything that snarls, you call me first, hear?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{i never turn down advice, sheriff. especially when it's free.}
