<L>__{interior cathedral day}
<A>__{olive enters a catholic church. it's empty, but there are a few candles burning. she sees the confessional booth and makes a beeline toward it. she takes a deep breath and enters.}
<L>__{interior confessional booth continuous}
<A>__{she sits down and begins to talk to the screen.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{forgive me, father, for i have sinned. i think that's how you're supposed to start these things. i'm only going on what i've seen in the movies. then, i think i'm supposed to tell you how long it's been since my last confession, but that's kind of my first confession. i'm not catholic. i really don't know what i'm supposed to do, except sit here in this booth and tell you what i've done wrong. where do i even start?}
<P>__{(beat.)}
<D>__{i've been pretending to be a how would one phrase it in catholic words? a harlot. it's not like i've actually been doing the things that people are saying i'm doing, but then again i'm not denying them, so i've just been wondering: is that wrong? there's a lot of shi `crap' going down at my school which may or may not be indirectly because of this masquerade.}
<P>__{(beat.)}
<D>__{i'm lying. i may have caused the end of a marriage. i thought, in my own perverse way, that i could help it. i mean, in my defense, i am merely an adolescent. i should never have been propositioned in the way i was propositioned by an adult. but then again, i should never have consented. it was just that a lot of people had been asking me to do things and i thought it was okay, because it wasn't real.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{it was make believe and no one was getting hurt. but a lot of people hate me now. i kind of hate me, too.}
<A>__{there's a long silence. olive tears up and wipes them away.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{i could be wrong, but aren't you supposed to say something or ask me questions. tell me to say `hail marys'? hello?}
<A>__{she looks through the screen. there's no one there.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{oh, come on!}
<A>__{she throws the curtain to the booth open and stomps out.}
