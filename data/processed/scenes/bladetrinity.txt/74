<L>__{interior nightstalkers headquarters night}
<A>__{we enter a sprawling industrial facility that is equal parts mechanics shop, firing range, and laboratory. we glimpse a virtual arsenal of new weaponry and medical equipment, including dna sequencers, microfuges, and electroporaters. the new equipment fights for space alongside the old mountains of mothballed parts from the park's broken thrill rides. here and there we see the oversized fiberglass head of a grinning fun house creature or the mildewed torso of a fortune telling mannequin, frozen in its upended booth.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{welcome to the honeycomb hideout.}
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{how do you bankroll this place?}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{internet porn. see, we're using cock suckers to pay for the blood suckers.}
<P>__{(off blade's look)}
<D>__{joke. come on, man. this isn't some piddly little hoopty ass operation, blade. we take our jobs very seriously.}
<A>__{up ahead, two others pause in their work as king approaches. dex falls in behind them. hedges (20s) is an engineer, always lost in his own world. sommerfield (30s) is a frail looking geneticist. she's also blind, operating her computers via a voice synthesis program and braille keyboard.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{you met dex. this is hedges, sommerfield }
<A>__{king gestures to them in turn. they're all refugees in one way or another, sharing a common guardedness, their lives having been shattered by the vampires.}
<C>__{king}
<P>__{(nodding back)}
<D>__{the runt you saw earlier is sommerfield's daughter, zoe. we call ourselves the nightstalkers.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{you sound like rejects from a saturday morning cartoon.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{we were gonna call ourselves the super friends, but that was taken.}
<A>__{abigail rids herself of her weapons bow, arrows, silver stakes and knives. she hands her compound bow to hedges.}
<C>__{abigail}
<D>__{tiller needs adjustment.}
<C>__{hedges}
<D>__{i will run it through the bow press.}
<A>__{blade examines some of the equipment being developed.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{how many of you are there total?}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{enough. we operate in sleeper cells. when one goes down, a new cell activates to pick up the slack. consider us your reinforcements.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{sorry. never been much of a team player.}
<C>__{sommerfield}
<D>__{i don't think you understand, blade. whistler meant for us to help you. when he died, he activated an emergency protocol. all his knowledge }
<A>__{she gestures to the computer equipment around her.}
<C>__{sommerfield}
<D>__{ was transferred to our servers here.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{and what makes you think you know so much about killing vampires?}
<A>__{king reaches for his collar, pulling it down to reveal a telltale mass of scar tissue in the shape of a bite mark.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{well for starters, i used to be one.}
<P>__{(in a sinister tone)}
<D>__{do i pass the audition?}
