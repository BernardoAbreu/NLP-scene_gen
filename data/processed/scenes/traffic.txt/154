<L>__{exterior verdant neighborhood day}
<A>__{birds are chirping. javi waits in the car as manolo takes the young lady's bags from the vehicle and carries them up the walkway to the arched doorway. he knocks on the heavy wooden door.}
<C>__{rosario}
<D>__{you don't have the keys. oh that's perfect. are you an idiot?}
<A>__{manolo knocks again. they wait a long beat.}
<C>__{manolo}
<D>__{there's supposed to be someone here to let you in.}
<A>__{finally, the door swings open and a bodyguard is standing there. rosario squeals and sweeps past him into the vast space. the bodyguard motions for manolo to put the bags inside the door. manolo sets the bags down and sees another man standing a few feet away. the man wears sunglasses. his complexion is strange and his neck is bandaged. the body guard escorts manolo back outside where he hears rosario's happy laughter drifting down from an upstairs window.}
