<A>__{sam is alone at the back of the parking lot, sitting on the hood of an old saab, smoking as two boys, josh and marek, both seventeen, park a porsche and pull alyssa beck (george's peeping neighbor) and another girl out of the backseat.}

<D>__{dude, nice look.}
<A>__{sam simply nods as marek and the other girl laugh at his all black garb, earrings and eye shadow.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i saw your dad this morning.}
<A>__{sam drops his cigarette and stomps it out as he stands; his face lightens as alyssa waves before walking away.}

<D>__{been thinking?}

<P>__{(as a dig)}
<D>__{they consider that a hatchback or a station wagon? oh, that isn't yours anyway, is it?}
<A>__{josh raises his eyebrows and smiles before walking away. sam faces the saab and kicks the bumper as hard as he can. suddenly, a boy (corey) bolts up from the back seat.}
<C>__{corey}
