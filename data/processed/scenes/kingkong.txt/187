<A>__{suddenly ... ann sees the legs of one of her pursuers lift off the ground it's taloned feet thrashing in mid air. he second carnivore turns and flees into the jungle, as ann is forced to watch the twitching legs shudder and flail. the sound of bone crunching ... crack! the carnivore's legs spasm and go limp. ann is completely still, she dare not breathe ... whatever killed the carnivore is now inches from her hiding place. close on: ann's face ... as she sees something crawling above her. close on: a dark hole, beneath the tree ... long feelers probe along the roof of the hole as a huge centipede crawls towards her. ann doesn't move as it inches towards her face. suddenly she feels another crawling up over her shoulder. ann freaks! she desperately scrambles away from the centipedes ... rolls out on the other side of the tree and stands to run... ... towering above her, with the dead carnivore hanging limply from it's huge jaws, is a tyrannosaurus rex! ann starts running! the tyrannosaur crashes after her with the dead carnivore still in it's mouth... as she races through the jungle, dodging trees, leaping over fallen logs, smashing through bushes, the tyrannosaur pounding ever closer in pursuit. ann can feel its hot sour breath blowing on the back of her neck! the huge jaws of the huge beast open inches from ann's head!}
