Touches it as it passes over her. Lindsey is without fear, completely mesmerized. The thing completes its turn and dives gracefully down along the wall.  She is gently lifted by a backwash of turbulent water. About that time, Lindsey remembers she has a still camera, a little Nikonos. She fumbles to set focus and exposure with her bulky gloves as the beautiful machine glides into the depths.  Gets all set for a shot and... WOOSH!  The little 'scoutschip' whizzes past her from behind, startling her. She completely misses the shot of the 'manta ship'.

Bud see a shortcut under the platform. He kicks along a lattice a pipes, heaving himself along in frantic hand-over- hand stokes.  He reaches for Flatbed's stern as it passes. Misses the last hand-hold... but just manages to seize a tie-down trailing behind it.  He is jerked along behind the sub. Bud holds on with both hands as he is buffeted in the wake of the powerful thrusters.  Flatbed gathers speed, moving out toward the edge of the abyssal wall.  The current slams him, spinning him like a fishing lure.  He pulls himself forward slowly until he can grip the stern rail of Flatbed's platform. LOW ANGLE, look up the wall.  Flatbed appears over the edge and stops. Hovering. ON THE BACK OF FLATBED.  Bud has the break he needs.  He scrambles up onto the deck and opens and equipment locker.  Nothing in it but one of the yellow nylon safety lines.  The big arm begins to unfold, lifting Geek/ROV.}

Bud kicks away rapidly, letting nylon rope pay out.  We see he has managed to tie one end to Geek's skids.  Coffey hits the button to activate the ROV, sending an acoustic pulse to Geek's transponder.  The little robot, pregnant with its load of death, turns nimbly around and dives out and down toward the void. Coffey pivots his bid machine toward Bud.  Bud strokes rapidly to a large jumble of wreckage.  He loops the rope around a twisted pipe.  Big Geek is hauling ass away from him.  The line snap taut an instant later.  The ROV strains, like a Rottweiler on a leash... trying to go.  The rope is slipping as Bud fights to make a knot. Flatbed slews around, thrusters whining.  As it banks, it hurls up clouds of sediment from the escarpment face. Through the front panel we see Coffey jerking on the controls. The big arm extends menacingly.  The smaller from manipulators open.  An enormous predatory instinct, its lights blaring. The big machine roars forward.  Straight at Bud. Bud gets his knot partly done.  See Flatbed looming. Glare-lit in its lights, Bud grabs a handlehold and pulls himself downward as Coffey closes the last few feet. One manipulator slams into his backpack, tumbling him, and the sub's underside rakes across his legs as it passes over.  Flatbed crushes into the tangle of pipework.  K-CRUUUNCH!!}

The nylon line starts to play through the knot slowly. BUD has gotten himself into a bad position.  Along the bare rock face of the cliff wall he is naked, nailed in the spotlights like a rabbit in front of a truck.  Coffey puts the hammer down, thrust levers all the way forward. Flatbed surges forward, multi-limbed and demonic.  There's no cover, side to side, up or down. Coffey has him head in his lights.  Suddenly a bright glare blasts in, blinding Coffey.  He looks up to see Cab One rushing down upon him, full throttle. At the last moment LIndsey slams the thrusters full-lock and the submersible slews sideways, slamming its heavy skidplate into Flatbed's cab.  Coffey is smashed sideways by the shock.

Lindsey is jinking and dodging as Flatbed, roars along behind her, tearing up the bottom with its powerful backwash.  Lindsey carves hard around a rock pinnacle, finding herself running parallel to the edge of the abyssal canyon. Coffey is ramming, hammering from behind, then from side to side. Lindsey snarls.  He's pissing her off.  He shouldn't do that. Ahead, out of the blackness, another outcropping. Lindsey rises, cuts right. Smashes down into Coffey's craft.  Timing it just right.  He skids catch in the rocks. Flatbed slews violently, nosing down.  Crushing into the rocky bottom. Pressing the advantage, Lindsey hammers into Flatbed from behind. It smashes full force into a second spire, spinning out of control. Tangles together, the subs slide down an embankment toward the edge of the wall.  With her one remaining thruster she jerks clear of Flatbed and grounds her crippled sub.  Flatbed tumbles over the edge.

It seems to be an angel.  Seen closer, as it drifts toward him, we see that it is an extraterrestrial being, bioluminescent like some deep-sea fish.  Its body and limbs are transparent, and it resembles a figure made of blown glass.  A delicate mantle or veil billows out around its like a corona, which pulsates gently, propelling the being with the hypnotic grace of a Spanish dancer.
