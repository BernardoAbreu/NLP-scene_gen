<A>__{the offices are ancient and a bit on the rickety side. there is a counter with a grill, something like a bank. before a door marked: "peter bailey, private", george's uncle billy stands, obviously trying to hear what is going on inside. he is a very good humored man of about fifty, in shirt sleeves. with him at the door, also listening, are cousin tilly bailey, a waspish looking woman, who is the telephone operator, and cousin eustace bailey, the clerk. the office vibrates with an aura of crisis as george enters and proceeds directly toward his father's office.}
