<A>__{ray is looking out the window at the top of the room. he is holding on to the metal wire conduit. seeing hardly anything, he judges it to be safe to go outside the furnace room. he walks by rachel who is sleeping in robbie's arms who is sleeping against some copper piping. holding his slightly burned arm in pain, ray exit's the room through the charred doors and finds most of the basement in ruins. the ground floor is now the top floor because the second floor was completely torn off. the camera pans out to find a winding down, burning airplane engine. panning out further we can see ray walking through the remains of different sections of an airplane.}
