<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{the second floor. oswald ambles past mrs. reid, a secretary in the second floor office, on his way out, coke bottle in hand and wearing his usual dreamy look... there's a lingering close up on his face.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{assuming he is the sole assassin, oswald is now free to escape from the building. the longer he delays, the more chance the building will be sealed by the police. is he guilty? does he walk out the nearest staircase? no, he buys a coke and at a slow pace, spotted by mrs. reid in the second floor office, he strolls out the more distant front exit, where the cops start to gather...}
<A>__{outside, we see oswald stroll out the door of the book depository into the crowd. he heads for the bus stop to the east.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{oddly, considering three shots are supposed to have come from there, nobody seals the depository for ten more minutes. oswald slips out, as do several other employees. of course, when he realized something had gone wrong and the president really had been shot, he knew there was a problem. he may even have known he was the patsy. an intuition maybe the president killed in spite of his warning. the phone call that never came. perhaps fear now came to lee oswald. he wasn't going to stand around for roll call.}
<A>__{back in the courtroom, jim continues speaking:}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{the story gets pretty confusing now more twists in it than a watersnake. richard carr says he saw four men take off from the book depository in a rambler that possibly belongs to janet williams. deputy roger craig says two men picked up oswald in the same rambler a few minutes later. other people say oswald took a bus out of there, and then because he was stuck in traffic, he hopped a cab to his rooming house in oak cliff...}
<A>__{flashback to: oswald's boarding house. oswald enters his room, passing earlene roberts, the heavyset white housekeeper.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{...we must assume he wanted to get back in touch with his intell team, probably at a safehouse or at the texas theatre, but how could he be sure? he didn't know who to trust anymore...}
<C>__{roberts}
<P>__{(watching tv)}
<D>__{my god, did you see that, mr. lee? a man shot the president.}
<A>__{the camera closes in on oswald's perplexed face. earlene peeks out the shades as she hears two short honks on a horn. outside is a black police car driven by tippit. also in the car is the fence shooter, dressed as a dallas policeman. the car drives by, honks twice, waits, then moves away. during this visual, we see the fence shooter changing his uniform into civilian clothes.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{oswald returns to this rooming house around 1 p.m., half hour after the assassination, puts on his jacket, grabs his .38 revolver, leaves at 1:04... earlene roberts, the housekeeper, says she heard two beeps on a car horn and two uniformed cops pulled up to the house while oswald was in his room, like it was a signal or something... officer tippit is shot between 1:10 and 1:15 about a mile away. though no one actually saw him walking or jogging, the government says oswald covered that distance. incidentally, that walk, if he did it, is in a straight line toward jack ruby's house. giving the government the benefit of the doubt, oswald would have had to jog a mile in six to eleven minutes and commit the murder, then reverse direction and walk 3 5 of a mile to the texas theatre and arrive sometime before 1:30. that's some walking.}
<A>__{on a street, oswald walks alone, fast. a police car pulls up alongside him on 10th street. oswald leans on the passenger side of the window. officer tippit, suspicious, gets out to question him. oswald pulls his .38 revolver and shoots him down in the street with 5 shots.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{it's also a useful conclusion. after all, why else would oswald kill officer tippit, unless he just shot the president and feared arrest? not one credible witness could identify oswald as tippit's killer.}
<A>__{domingo benavides, hidden in his truck only a few yards away, watches as another unidentified man (not seen before) shoots and walks away.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{domingo benavides, the closest witness to the shooting, refused to identify oswald as the killer and was never taken to a lineup.}
<A>__{we see acquilla clemons, a black woman, looking on. she watches as two men kill tippit. one of them resembles the fence shooter. the other one is a mystery figure, seen before in the fringes. the men walk off quickly in opposite directions. we notice a policeman's uniform hanging in the back seat of tippit's car.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{acquilla clemons saw the killer with another man and says they went off in separate directions. mrs. clemons was never taken to lineup or to the warren commission. mr. frank wright, who saw the killer run away, stated flatly that the killer was not lee oswald. oswald is found with a .38 revolver. tippit is killed with a .38 automatic. at the scene of the crime officer j.m. poe marks the shells with his initials to record the chain of evidence.}
