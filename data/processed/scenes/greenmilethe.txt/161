<L>__{exterior georgia pines day}
<A>__{the rain has mostly stopped. brad dolan, back in street clothes, gets in his pickup truck and drives away...}
<L>__{interior nursing home day}
<A>__{...while paul and elaine watch from a window.}
<L>__{exterior georgia pines day}
<A>__{this time, we see two red specks trudging slowly up the ridge toward the treeline.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior woods day}
<A>__{paul brings elaine along the wooded path into view of the storage shacks. they're both wearing ponchos.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{there. it's in there.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{paul? this thing you want to show me. is it scary?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{scary? no. not really.}
<A>__{he gives her a smile, offers his hand. she takes it.}
<L>__{interior shack day}
<A>__{we see paul approach through the grimy window as before, this time bringing elaine. angle shifts to the door as they arrive, creaking open on rusty hinges to reveal them. they enter. elaine looks around at the musty nooks and crannies, wondering what they're doing here. paul touchers arm, directs her attention:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{there.}
<A>__{elaine moves closer, sees it on the dusty floorboards: an old cigar box. for a moment, she doesn't know what to make of it.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hey. wake up, old boy. wake up.}
<A>__{elaine's breath catches in her throat... ...as a pair of bright oilspot eyes peer over the edge of the cigar box. it's a mouse. his fur, once brown, is now all gray.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{paul? it isn't...it can't be...}
<A>__{paul gets down on the floor, holds out his hand.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{come over here, boy. come on over her and see this lady.}
<A>__{the mouse tries several times to get over the side of the cigar box before he finally makes it. he comes to them, hobbling and crippled with arthritis. paul pulls a slice of toast from his pocket, breaks off a small piece for the mouse.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{that can't be mr. jingles.}
<A>__{paul says nothing, just pulls a spool from his pocket. mr. jingles might be old, but he's as obsessed as ever. he gets ready to fetch, eyes riveted to the spool. softly:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{messieurs et mesdames. beinvenue au cirque du mousie.}
<A>__{paul tosses the spool. the mouse limps painfully after it. he reaches it, goes around...and has to lay down to catch his breath. elaine starts forward, but paul holds her back. after a moment, mr. jingles finds his feet again. he rises and starts nosing the spool back to paul.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{oh, paul. don't make him do it again. i can't bear to watch.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{but he loves it so much.}
<A>__{he glances around at the shack with a sad smile.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{this isn't exactly the mouseville we had in mind...but we make do, don't we, old fella?}
<C>__{brad }
<D>__{as i live and breathe!}
<A>__{they gasp and spin. brad dolan stands in the doorway.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{fooled you, didn't i got yourself a little love nest here, i see...}
<A>__{he pauses, seeing mr. jingles.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{...what the fuck? is that a mouse?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{don't hurt him, okay? okay?}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{it's a goddamn mouse, y'old fool, they carry all kind'a disease...}
<A>__{brad grabs an old garden hoe the blade's rusted, but still sharp enough to cut a mouse in two.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{...now step aside.}
<A>__{paul rushes in front of brad, fists clenched, yelling:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you leave him alone, percy! you leave him alone, or by god i will }
<A>__{brad gives paul a hard shove, pins him against the wall.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{who you calling percy? name's brad, you senile fucker. and i'm gonna nail that mouse, you can take that to the everfucking bank.}
<A>__{elaine is suddenly at brad's elbow, seething with fury:}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{how dare you? get out!}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{piss off, you wrinkeldy old bitch. me and paulie are talking.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{his name is mr. edgecomb. if you ever call him paulie again, your days of employment at georgia pines will end.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{who the hell you think you are?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i am the grandmother of the man who is currently speaker of the georgia house of representatives. a man who loves his relatives, mr. dolan. all it would take is a phone call.}
<A>__{brad's smile falters. elaine steps closer.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{at first i thought i'd let you be. i'm old, and that seemed easiest. but when my friends are threatened and abused, i do not let it be.}
<P>__{(icy beat)}
<D>__{now get out, or you won't work another day here. not another hour. i swear it.}
<A>__{brad eases his grip on paul...and backs off.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{don't know what you're getting so het up about. just a damn mouse.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{get out, you ignorant man. what little mind you have is ugly and misdirected.}
<A>__{brad flushes red, heads for the door. he pauses.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{don't bother coming back here tomorrow...mr. edgecomb gonna be a new lock on this door. this is off limits to residents, no matter what mrs. my shit don't stink has to say about it.}
<A>__{and off he goes. paul tries to control the shaking in his hands, looks to elaine.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{little trick i learned from percy wetmore.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{is your grandson really speaker of the house?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{he is.}
<A>__{paul bends down, picks mr. jingles up.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you gonna thank the lady? she just saved your old mousie hide.}
<A>__{the mouse stretches his neck forward, nose twitching, smelling paul's breath. paul looks to elaine. softly:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i think mr. jingles happened by accident. i think when we electrocuted del, and it all went so badly...well, john could feel it, you know...and i think a tiny part of whatever was inside of him just leapt out...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{me, i was no accident. john had to give me a little part of himself...a gift, like...so i could see for myself what wild bill had done. when john did that, a part of whatever power worked through him spilled into me.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{he...what? infected you with life?}
<A>__{paul looks at the mouse, strokes him gently between the ears.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's as good a word as any. he infected us both, didn't he, mr. jingles. with life.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm a hundred and five years old, elaine. i was forty the year john coffey walked the green mile.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{...oh my god...}
<A>__{camera pushes slowly in on paul as:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i haven't even had a cold since 1935. i've had to watch my friends and loved ones die off through the years...hal and melinda...brutus howell...my wife...my son...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{...and you, elaine. you'd die, too, and my curse is knowing i will be there to see it...}
