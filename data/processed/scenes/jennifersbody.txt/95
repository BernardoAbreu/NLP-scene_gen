<L>__{exterior murphy pool same}
<A>__{murphy pool is even eerier from the inside. the fenced in deck area is littered with garbage, abandoned pool furniture and graffiti. someone has spray painted the word "hopeless" on a wall. chip shivers and looks around nervously. jennifer nonchalantly unzips her dress and shimmies out of it, revealing her bra and panties.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{aren't you cold?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{never, trevor. i'm hot like magma.}
<A>__{she prances over to the abandoned pool and begins to climb down the ladder on the side. the pool is full of filthy, freezing water.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{swimming.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{ha ha.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{come on in, chip. show me your breast stroke.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{the water looks disgusting.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{it's not so bad.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{are you kidding? it's totally bubonic in there. i think i see a dead possum with a doritos bag in its pouch. and that looks like a used syringe over there...}
<A>__{he slaps away a fly.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i was just trying to make you laugh. i think now, more than ever, we need laughter. we've both lost a close friend.}
<A>__{chip nods sadly.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i feel so empty.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{me too.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{please come here and kiss me again. make all this madness go away.}
<A>__{chip tiptoes forward tentatively and sinks to his knees. he leans in and kisses jennifer, who's still clinging to the ladder. the sound of buzzing flies grows louder. suddenly, jennifer opens her eyes. she hooks her arm around chip's neck and lunges backward. they tumble off the ladder, into the pool. chip screams.}
