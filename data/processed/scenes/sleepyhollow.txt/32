<D>__{the lenape. he comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.}
<A>__{ichabod's point of view through spyglass searching a line of trees and foliage far away...}
<C>__{doctor lancaster }
<D>__{do you see the redskinned bastard?}
<A>__{there he is the lenape. a towering savage with misshapen features covered in tumors. he ducks away.}
