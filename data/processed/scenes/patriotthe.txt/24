<L>__{interior assembly hall day}
<A>__{two dozen angry, yelling, men of property. among them are robinson, hamill and johnson, who are patriots. opposed to them are simms, withington and baldridge who are loyalists (loyal the the king). as marion makes his way to his seat, the speaker of the assembly pounds his gavel.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{order! order!}
<A>__{slowly, the room quiets down.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{our first order of business...}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{and out last if we vote a levy...}
<A>__{the room erupts.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{order! order! mr. simms, you do not have the floor.}
<A>__{the room settles down.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{our first order of business is an address by colonel harry lee of the continental army.}
<A>__{an imposing figure rises and makes his way to the front of the assembly. he's colonel harry lee, about marion's age and cut from the same cloth strong, weathered, with a powerful bearing. the room quiets down. lee sees marion and offers a familiar nod, which marion returns, stone faced. then lee speaks, simply and clearly.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{you all know why i am here. i am not an orator and i will not try to convince you of the worthiness of our cause. i am a soldier and we are at war and with the declaration of independence we all expect from philadelphia, it will soon be a formal state of war. in preparation for that, eight of the thirteen colonies have levied money in support of a continental army. i ask south carolina to be the ninth.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{colonel lee, massachusetts may be at war, along with new hampshire and rhode island and virginia, but south carolina is not at war.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{massachusetts and new hampshire are not as far from south carolina as you might think and the war they're fighting is not for independence of one or two colonies. it's for the independence of a nation.}
<C>__{withington}
<D>__{and what nation is that?}
<A>__{robinson, one of the patriots, stands up.}
<C>__{robinson}
<D>__{an american nation. colonel lee, with your permission?}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{please.}
<C>__{robinson}
<D>__{those of us who call ourselves patriots are not seeking to give birth to an american nation, but to protect one that already exists. it was born a hundred and seventy years ago at jamestown, virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested. we are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{thank you. were i an orator, those are the exact words i would have spoken.}
<A>__{laughter. marion rises.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{mister robinson, tell me, why should i trade one tyrant, three thousand miles away, for three thousand tyrants, one mile away?}
<A>__{laughter from the loyalists. surprise from lee and the patriots. in the gallery, gabriel winces.}
<C>__{robinson}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{an elected legislature can trample a man's rights just as easily as a king can.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{captain marion, i understood you to be a patriot.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{it's mister marion.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i understood him to be a patriot as well.}
<A>__{more laughter.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{if you mean by a patriot, am i angry at the townsend acts and the stamp act? then i'm a patriot. and what of the navigation act? should i be permitted to sell my tobacco to the french traders on martinique? yes, and it's an intrusion into my affairs that i can't... legally.}
<A>__{laughter.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{and what of the greedy, self serving bastards who sit as magistrates on the admiralty court and have fined nearly every man in this room. should they be boxed about the ears and thrown onto the first ship back to england? i will do it myself.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and do i believe that the american colonies should stand as a separate, independent nation, free from the reins of king and parliament? i do, and if that makes a patriot, then i'm a patriot.}
<A>__{marion grows more serious.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{but if you're asking whether i'm willing to go to war with england, the answer is, no. i've been to war and i have no desire to do so again.}
<A>__{the room is quiet, the assemblymen having been thrown off balance. gabriel is stunned and disappointed by his father's speech.}
<C>__{robinson}
<D>__{this from the same captain francis marion whose anger was so famous during the wilderness campaign.}
<A>__{marion glares at robinson, then smiles.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i was intemperate in my youth. my departed wife, god bless her soul, dampened that intemperance with the mantle of responsibility.}
<A>__{robinson looks derisively at marion.}
<C>__{robinson}
<D>__{temperance can be a convenient disguise for fear.}
<A>__{marion bristles but before he can answer, lee steps in.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{mister robinson, i fought with captain marion in the french and indian war, including the wilderness campaign. we served as scouts under washington and i have no doubts about captain marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. there's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom i would more willingly trust my life.}
<C>__{robinson}
<D>__{i stand corrected.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{nonetheless, i would like to know, mister marion, how... how... how...}
<A>__{lee's oratorical skills peter out.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{damn it, francis! how in god's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{harry, harry, harry...}
<A>__{marion and lee drop all formality and become nothing more than two old friends, pissed off.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{my hairy arse! you live in a cave if you think we'll get independence without war...}
<A>__{the speaker pounds his gavel.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{gentlemen! please! this is not a tavern!}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{wasn't it a union jack we fought under?}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{a long time ago...}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{thirteen years...}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{that's a damn long time...}
<A>__{the speaker pounds his gavel again.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{gentlemen! please!}
<A>__{marion and lee ignore the speaker.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{you were an englishman then...}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i was an american, i just didn't know it yet...}
<A>__{the astonished assemblymen and now even the speaker watch the argument avidly, turning their heads in simultaneous anticipation of each rejoinder.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{we don't have to go to war to gain independence...}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{balderdash!}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{there are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{name five hundred.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{that's five, keep going...}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{you said bribery twice...}
<A>__{marion speaks slowly and firmly.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{we do not have to go to war to gain independence.}
<A>__{lee says nothing for a moment, then he speaks more seriously, quietly, grimly.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{francis, i was at bunker hill. it was as bad as anything you and i saw on the frontier. worse than the slaughter at the ashuelot river. the british advanced three times and we killed over seven hundred of them at point blank range. and still, they advanced and they took the ground. that is the measure of their resolve. if your principles dictate independence, then war is the only way. it has come to that.}
<A>__{marion is silent for a long moment. he softens, finds himself unsteady and speaks far more honestly than he ever wanted to.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i have seven children. my wife is dead. who's to care for them if i go to war?}
<A>__{lee is stunned by marion's honesty and his show of weakness. at first lee has no answer, then:}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{wars are not fought only by childless men. a man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{that's what i'm doing. i will not fight and because i won't, i will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{and your principles?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i'm a parent, i don't have the luxury of principles.}
<A>__{the other assemblymen, both patriots and loyalists, stare at him, appalled. marion, feeling weak, sits down. lee looks at his friend with more sympathy than disappointment. then lee turns to robinson who addresses the chair.}
<C>__{robinson}
<D>__{mister speaker, i call for a vote on a levy to the continental army.}
<C>__{hamill}
<D>__{second.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{so moved.}
<A>__{the vote is taken on a roll call. gabriel watches from the gallery.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{mr. robinson.}
<C>__{robinson}
<D>__{yea.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{mr. hamill.}
<C>__{hamill}
<D>__{yea.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{mr. johnson.}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{yea.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{mr. simms.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{nay.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{mr. marion.}
<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{mr. marion.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{nay.}
<A>__{in the gallery gabriel turns and walks out. the roll call continues. marion sits, eyes straight ahead.}
