<L>__{int pigsty day}
<A>__{the creature and the pigs are sleeping in a heap. he rouses, scattering them, crawls to the slats of the sty. felix is returning wearily from the fields with a large basket on his back. the creature moves to his chink in the wall to see felix enter the house and dump the basket out for marie. a pathetic array of potatoes and turnips.}
<C>__{felix}
<D>__{not much to look at. even less to eat. i don't how we're going to get through the winter with this yield.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{we'll sell another pig at market.}
<C>__{felix}
<D>__{one less for us.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{we'll make do. we always have.}
<A>__{he sinks into a chair, weighed by worry. she moves to comfort him, cradling his head to her breast. he returns her embrace, drawing strength. a tender, gentle moment. the creature watches, puzzled and empathetic, deeply moved by her sympathy. felix gathers himself, wipes his eyes.}
<C>__{felix}
<D>__{i will see if i can scratch a few more out of the ground.}
<A>__{he hoists the basket and exits. the creature turns to watch felix trudging back toward the fields.}
