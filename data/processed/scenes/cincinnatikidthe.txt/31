<A>__{christian and melba are on adjoining rubbing tables, a curtain separating them from the waist down only. their heads are close enough so they can talk without their masseurs necessarily hearing every word they say.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{you find a guy, you love him, and that's it. it's supposed to just go on like that for life. right?}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{according to the propaganda, right.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{but it isn't my life, it's his life, with me tacked on. you have any idea what it's like to be a hash slinger in a cheap restaurant?}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{no, honey, the stock crash wafted me right from the daisy chain into unmarried bliss.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{it's hell, if you'll excuse the word. but i didn't want to quit. the kid made me. i felt i ought to hang on to something that was me away from him. you know what i mean?}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{sure. some girls solve the problem by taking on an extra guy.}

<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{why not? well, if he was rich and famous, maybe i wouldn't mind so much just being just a woman to him. do you think that might make it seem more worthwhile somehow?}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{somehow! are you sincere, sweetie?}
<P>__{(reacting to the masseur's touch)}
<D>__{oooo divine.}
<P>__{(to christian)}
