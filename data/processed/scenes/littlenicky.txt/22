<L>__{exterior village street}
<A>__{nicky and beefy.}
<C>__{beefy}
<D>__{so i found this other joint for you. but you're gonna have a roommate.}
<L>__{interior apartment night}
<A>__{a scruffy, thirtyish buy, todd (allen covert), is on the phone in his small, bohemian apartment in the village.}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{i know exactly how you feel... the night reagan was elected, i said to my mother, "is this man going to blow up the world, mommy?" then we both cried for like an hour.}
<P>__{(knock at the door)}
<D>__{somebody's here. call you later.}
<A>__{todd gets up and opens the door. it's nicky, with beefy by his side. nicky is nervous, and his speech sounds practiced.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{hello, friend, my name is nicky. i understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the village voice. would it be possible for me to fill the slot?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?}
<A>__{nicky looks down at beefy. beefy looks up at nicky. both nod imperceptibly.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{yes. what is rent?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{eight hundred, split down the middle. tuesdays and thursdays i rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{off limits.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{right. and as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60 40. cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.}
<P>__{(looks at nicky)}
<D>__{aren't you boiling in that outfit?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{it's like eighty degrees in this hallway. you from the south?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{yeah. the deep south.}
<A>__{nicky laughs a little too hard.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{why is that funny?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{and sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.}
<A>__{todd turns and goes into the apartment.}
<C>__{beefy}
<D>__{you'll be alright. go on. big day tomorrow. don't forget to do that sleep thing i told you about.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{got ya.}
<P>__{(to todd)}
<D>__{is it okay if i do the sleep thing?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{yeah, your bedroom is right over there.}
<A>__{the door closes. beefy looks down at the welcome mat. it reads: i "heart" method acting. beefy raises his leg over it.}
