<L>__{interior police station detective's office day}
<A>__{molly is sitting in a room opposite detective sergeant thomas beiderman, 48, and sergeant dorothy wallace, 29. both officers are staring at her as she speaks. she seems very uncomfortable.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{look, you've gotta believe me. i don't even believe this stuff, myself. but this is real. do you think i'd come here if it wasn't real? you told me to come if i had any new information. well, here i am.}
<A>__{the officers don't respond.}
<C>__{molly}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{don't look at me like that. you guys use psychics all the time.}
<A>__{there is dead silence.}
<C>__{molly}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{damn it. i know how this sounds. i hear myself saying it and i want to cringe. but this woman knew things she couldn't have known, intimate details.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{how intimate?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{things sam only said to me.}
<C>__{wallace}
<P>__{(smirking)}
<D>__{okay, let me get this straight. according to this psychic lady, there are ghosts and spirits all over the place, watching us all the time, huh?...}
<P>__{(she stands up)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i've got important things to do.}
<A>__{she leaves the room. molly gives her a dirty look and turns to beiderman.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i'm telling you. the killer's name is willie lopez. i've got his address. you've got to check it out.}
<A>__{sgt. beiderman gets up and looks over to molly.}
<C>__{sgt. beiderman}
<D>__{okay. you just wait here. let me see if this guy's got a record.}
<A>__{he heads out of the room. molly sits back with an air of enormous relief and gratitude. sergeant wallace comes into the room again and picks up a folder. molly waits nervously. after a moment sergeant beiderman returns with a police file in his hands. molly looks up at him, and then smiles at wallace as she sees it. she feels vindicated. he lays the thick folder on the desk and opens it up. she hurries over to him.}
