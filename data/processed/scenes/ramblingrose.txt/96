<A>__{a shot of mother's bedroom study in the moonlight. we see daddy lying wide awake in a single bed staring broodingly out into space. mother lies asleep in a big four poster in the background of the shot. daddy sighs wearily to himself in the grip of "insomnia in reverse."}
<L>__{interior hillyer home buddy's bedroom night}
<T>__{cut back :}
<A>__{to buddy and rose in bed. he has evidently sweet talked her into letting him fiddle with her; his hand is in her nightgown. there is no indication of lewd interest on rose's part, a peeved and exasperated look is on her face. buddy seems quite fascinated, however.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{well, are you satisfied now? can we just lie and talk, huh?}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{hmmph. it has a nipple, all right.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{'course it does.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{first i couldn't feel it, but now i feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(moistens her lips,}
<D>__{swallows; it is affecting}
<P>__{her; she frowns)}
<D>__{all right, that's enough.}
<P>__{(firmly pushes his hand away)}
<D>__{you're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. now lie back and we'll talk.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{that was very interesting. thank you, rose.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(lighting cigarette)}
<D>__{don't mention it.}
<C>__{buddy}
<P>__{(pensively, with the}
<D>__{solemn pedanticness of a}
<P>__{precocious child)}
<D>__{it was softer'n i thought, that was my main impression. you know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{who would want to do such a thing as that?}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{well, some fiend might.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(stares wonderingly at him)}
<D>__{you know, buddy, sometimes i can't figure you out at all. you can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{there's an evil streak in everybody, rose.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{there ain't none in your daddy. you know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. i not only love him, i respect him, i admire him.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{rose, i have a serious favor to ask you.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{most men wouldn't do what he done. if they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her i guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. they're a bunch of monkeys. i like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.}
<C>__{buddy}
<P>__{(trying to be casual)}
<D>__{rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and i've already touched your titty...}
<A>__{can't quite say it; leans over and whispers in her ear and we don't hear what he says.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(her eyes open wide as he whispers)}
<D>__{why, buddy, shut your mouth! what an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{i'm curious to see what it's like. i'm very curious, rose.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{well, now that is just too bad! curiosity killed the cat.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. can i?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{no! you ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{can't i touch it a little, rose not a lot, just a little?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{of course you can't! i'm... i'm shocked at you, buddy, real shocked! now you be quiet or i'm going back to my own bed!}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{please, rose. i'm curious, that's all, i have a natural curiosity, it's only human. you're my friend, aren't you? don't you like me?}
<P>__{(again sweetly, almost sugarily)}
<D>__{i like you, rose, a lot in fact, i love you.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(softens despite herself)}
<D>__{well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{yes, i do. please, rose, be a good sport.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{buddy, you're just a child.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{i'm thirteen. and i have a natural curiosity. it's only nature, rose, that's all. now what's wrong with nature, huh?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{well, nothin'.}
