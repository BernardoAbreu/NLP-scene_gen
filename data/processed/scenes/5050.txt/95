<A>__{seth leads a tour of foreign tourists through the museum. he speaks as he did earlier like a game show host.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{and if you look over on your left you'll see our newest exhibit "the last days pompeii." buried in 79 ad by the catastrophic eruption of mt. vesuvius, pompeii remained hidden and forgotten until 1748 when archeologists began to excavate the site. here we see exquisitely preserved objects that offer a glimpse into the day to day life of this ancient city.}
<A>__{seth comes upon adam who is working closely on a diorama.}
<C>__{seth }
<D>__{this here is adam, one of our curators. adam do you want to tell us what you're working on?}

<P>__{(upbeat)}
<D>__{gladly. this here is a depiction of what pompeii's final 19 hours probably looked like.}
<A>__{adam's exhibit is a highly morbid depiction of pompeii's final hours. the scene is total chaos. ash flies through the air. hot molten lava engulfs the town. miniature men, women, and children run through the streets in horror. people are sacrificing whatever they can for the gods. there's a wild orgy in the streets. and a giant tyrannosaurs rex model devours a villager.}

<D>__{according to pliny the younger "you could hear women lamenting, children crying, men shouting. there were some so afraid of death that they prayed for death. many raised their hands to the gods, and even more believed that there were no gods any longer, and that this was one unending night for the world."}
<A>__{the tourists take pictures. in shock, seth quickly shuttles the group away.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{ok. moving along we see the beautiful watercolor paintings of john james audobon.}
<A>__{seth looks back at adam like he's lost his mind.}
