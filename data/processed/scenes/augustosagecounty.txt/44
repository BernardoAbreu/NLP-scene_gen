<L>__{interior beverly's lincoln (moving) afternoon}
<D>__{barbara drives, karen beside her. heat radiates off the road. they follow charlie's caddie, vi and ivy visible in the caddie's back seat window ahead of us.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i mean i'd kiss my pillow, and then i'd tell him i'd been to the doctor that day and i'd found out i was pregnant. i know how pathetic that sounds, but it was innocent enough. then real life takes over, cause it always does }
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{ uh huh here comes the red speck in the rearview again. the ferrari roars up behind them, pulls around to pass, honks as it goes. barb catches a glimpse of jean in the passenger seat, bill jammed into the tiny back seat.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{things don't work out like you planned. that pillow was a better husband than any real man i'd ever met; this parade of men fails to live up to your expectations, all of them so much less than daddy or bill. you punish yourself, tell yourself it's your fault you can't find a good one. i don't know how well you remember andrew...}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{no, i remember.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i loved him so intensely, so the things he did wrong were just opportunities for me to make things right. if he cheated on me or called me a cunt, i'd think "no, love is forever, so here's an opportunity to make an adjustment in the way you view the world." the ac isn't working, barb's sweating, rolls down her window, let's the wind whip her hair around.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{and thank god one day i looked in the mirror and said, "moron," and walked out, but it kicked off this whole period of reflection, how hard i had screwed it up, where'd i go wrong. that's when i got into those books and discussion groups }
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{and scientology too, right, or something like that ?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{exactly, and finally one day, i threw it all out, i said, "it's me, just me with my music on the stereo, my glass of wine and bloomers my cat. i don't need anything else, i can live my life with myself." i got my license, threw myself into my work, sold a lot of houses, and that's when i met steve. charlie slows, signals, turns onto the gravel road leading to the weston house. barb follows, karen still going strong }
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{that's how it works, you only find it when you're not looking, you turn around and there it is: steve. ten years older than me, but a thinker, and he's just so good. he's a good man and he's good to me and he's good for me.}
