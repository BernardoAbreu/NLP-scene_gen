<L>__{interior "heaven" mansion conference room day}
<A>__{ted takes a seat at the spacious conference table. helen sits on his right. charlie sits on his left. zukerman and two other impatient attorneys wait at the head of the table. finally zukerman checks his watch and rises.}
<C>__{zukerman}
<D>__{we're running out of time. the kid's here. we don't need him.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{perhaps we could be patient for just a moment or two longer?}
<A>__{they all watch a wall clock. seconds pass, slowly, slowly. then suddenly zukerman rises.}
<C>__{zukerman}
<D>__{what did the doctor say to the nurse as they watched something black and white and red in a blender?}
<P>__{(a wry smile)}
<D>__{no more patients.}
<A>__{very dramatically, zukerman slides a copy of "heaven" magazine down the conference table. right to ted.}
<C>__{zukerman }
<D>__{are you familiar with "heaven?"}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i'm seventeen. i know it like the back of my hand.}
<C>__{zukerman}
<D>__{your fathered owned the entire "heaven" empire. you own it now. any questions?}
<A>__{ted's stunned, speechless. charlie gawks.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{everything? the publishing division, the real estate holdings, the retail outlets, the theme parks?}
<C>__{zukerman}
<D>__{as far as the eye can see.}
<A>__{zukerman presses a remote control. a wall panel slides open to reveal a large monitor which springs to life. on the screen is a striking couple. ted's biological parents. heather and tom deeds. heather, stunningly sexy and overflowing from her gold sequined halter top. tom, very handsome in a vegas showman sort of way.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{oh, sweetheart! we wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{but if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{but don't worry...we'll be in heaven. the real heaven, i mean. not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. or not being. who knows. maybe we know now.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{if you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? am i right?}
<A>__{ted looks guilty. this is too weird.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{but we did want you. it's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. we knew you needed a real mom and dad.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{we had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.}
<A>__{heather holds up the first issue of "heaven." she's on the cover, wearing nothing but a halo. she looks almost exactly the same today, with a few extra nips and tucks.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{can you believe that was me?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. the rest is history.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{so here we are. dead. but we never want you to want for anything. that is, we want you to have everything.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{everything.}
<A>__{heather leans forward and blows a kiss into the camera. her strongest assets spilling forward.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{we love you, ted. we always did. we always will.}
<A>__{charlie's practically slobbering. he elbows ted.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i can't believe that's your mother. we're talking babe a licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{perv.}
<A>__{at that moment, the doors burst open. william g. deeds (uncle billy) sails into the room. handsome in an unconventional way, he exudes passion and eccentricity.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{i'm so terribly sorry. am i too late?}
<C>__{zukerman}
<D>__{ah, mr. deeds. you're just in time to congratulate your nephew. he inherited the empire.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<P>__{(a broad smile)}
<D>__{every morsel of it?}
<C>__{zukerman}
<D>__{it would appear so.}
<A>__{uncle billy hugs ted with great enthusiasm.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{smashing! welcome to the family, ted. you are going to breathe some new life into this place. you are going to set the world on fire! you are going to...call me uncle billy? please?}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(awkwardly)}
<D>__{uh, sure. uncle billy.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{i have only one concern...}
<A>__{ted waits. swept up by uncle billy's spirit.}
<C>__{uncle billy }
<D>__{you do like girls, don't you?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{of course i like girls.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{a lot? i mean, a whole lot?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{as much as possible.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{you're sure?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(to the rescue)}
<D>__{he likes them with the unbridled enthusiasm of a seventeen year old virgin who's been making mental beef jerky since he saw the bevy of tender young skirt steaks at his new hacienda.}
<A>__{uncle billy grins broadly.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{that's my boy!}
