<A>__{sonny and mulvaney move toward the back door and stop under a trap door in the ceiling. mulvaney looks up at it.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{it's gonna be up there.}
<A>__{as sonny is staring up at the trap door, thinking about what to do, he hears a tiny scratching sound.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{sonny, tensing like an animal, peers around wildly to locate the source of the little scratching sound: like mice at a steel door.}
<B>__{on sonny}
<A>__{who quickly runs back toward the desk area. on group desks' area sonny races back in, grabs the gun from atop mulvaney's desk, and with the cartridge in the other hand, runs back toward the back door again, jamming cartridge into rifle. at this point, sal runs in from the conference room, covering everyone point blank again, yelling for edna to join the rest of the group.}

<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{sonny, if you shoot, shoot high... my car's parked out there.}
<B>__{on sonny}
<A>__{staring at the door. he hears the continued scratching noise and might even see the door knob move. abruptly he swings the rifle up so the bullet going through will clearly go over the head of any man, out through the transom. he fires. angle on inside sal and group they all scream, some of them falling to the floor, huddling together in terror. sonny and group sonny races back into main area where sal covers group.}
