<L>__{interior victor's office night}
<A>__{a bent needle pierces two flaps of skin, drawing a line of blood with the thread. victor ties another stitch in vic jr.'s arm. he's had practice at this. in the background, the bartender and noelle are watching. victor's tirade is directed at all of them.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{just because a rapper has a white buddy doesn't mean he's sidney fucking poitier. you check them. you pat them down.}
<C>__{vic jr.}
<P>__{(gritted teeth)}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{victor}
<P>__{(to noelle)}
<D>__{and you, you were on top of him. you didn't feel anything.}
<A>__{she shakes her head, crying.}
<D>__{victor [cont'd] this thing. this thing is a wall of shit. it is a fucking call from on high that i have to leave. i have to get out before this all just falls in on me.}
<A>__{vic jr. winces with pain.}
<D>__{victor [cont'd] you know what wakes me up in the middle of the night, covered in sweat? you aren't any worse than anyone else of your fucked up generation. towel.}
<A>__{noelle hands him a towel to mop up the blood.}
<D>__{victor [cont'd] in the old days, you know how you got to the top? by being better than the guy ahead of you.}
<P>__{victor [cont'd] (cont'd)}
<D>__{how do you people get to the top? by being so fucking incompetent that the guy ahead of you can't even do his job, he falls on his ass and congratulations, you're on top. only now the top is down here when it used to be up here and you don't even know the difference.}
<A>__{he finishes the last stitch, tying it off.}
<D>__{victor [cont'd] my generation, we're dinosaurs. we're gonna die. you're gonna kill us off. but you'll never be dinosaurs. you're little fucking rats and that's all you're ever going to be.}
<A>__{holly looks in, holding a gold card. victor motions, "well?" she hands it over.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{they said they were from los angeles.}
<A>__{noelle nods.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{then they must be staying somewhere, isn't that right noelle?}
<A>__{noelle nods harder, crying again.}
