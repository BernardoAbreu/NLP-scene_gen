<L>__{interior newsroom day}
<A>__{paul arriving with bill rorish. the first time we have seen the multi millionaire anchorman in the flesh. he has the grace and dignity of a man who spends every waking moment working on grace and dignity, he and paul are in the midst of an important conversation muted and ominous.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{just when do you start, telling people?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{almost immediately.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i'd like to take everyone out after the show.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{bill...this is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. but i think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{if we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization.}
<A>__{blair enters scene. the smallest flicker of interest from bill, but more than enough to justify her going into hock for the outfit.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{welcome back to washington.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{a self conscious look of greeting to paul and she's gone.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i've forgotten. was she on the list?}
<A>__{paul nods "yes."}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{this is a brutal layoff...and all because they couldn't program wednesdays.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(can't resist)}
<D>__{you can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.}
<A>__{as bill turns:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{just a bad joke. i'm sorry. awful. it's a miserable day and that was some kind of totally sick joke defense mechanism which does not indicate any of my feelings not one but just shows the kind of stress this represents for all of us.}
<A>__{tom and his father enter the scene from tom's office. bill walks to tom.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{hi. it's about time.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{good to see you, bill.}
<A>__{as they shake:}
<B>__{insert}
<A>__{a great handshake. on mr. grunick's face touched, as he watches the networks' most prominent journalist greet his son.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{this is my father.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{good to meet you, sir.}
<B>__{on tom}
<A>__{equally touched as he watches the world's most prominent journalist greet his dad, who turns goofy with excitement.}
<C>__{mr. grunick}
<D>__{good bye, tom.}
<A>__{he puts a big hand on his son's cheek a farewell pat. then whispers in his ear.}
<C>__{mr. grunick}
<D>__{i'm going to go back home and tell all your old teachers.}
<A>__{tom watches his father walk off and moves immediately to jane's editing room.}
