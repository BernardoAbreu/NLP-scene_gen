<L>__{interior horse box, pikey camp day}
<A>__{the two fighters start pacing. it looks a bit ridiculous, micky is dwarfed by comparison. gorgeous george takes a swipe: it was an .impressive punch, but micky is a quick littl bastard and sidesteps. micky does nothing to retaliate; his hands are still by his,side. gorgeous george lunges out and grabs micky by the throat and groin, picks him up like a sack of spuds and throws him against the car door. all eyes are on micky for a second or two, then he rises and appears little bothered by this, he gets up brushes himself off and starts to pace again, hardly even looking at the big man.}

<D>__{you want to stay down my friend, i promise you, you want to stay down.}
<A>__{micky ignores this and continues to pace, the big fella grabs him and puts him in a headlock and charges him into the stable door. there is a terrible noise.}
<C>__{gorgeous george }
<D>__{now you fucking stay down boy or you won't be coming up next time.}
<A>__{it appears as though this is going to get messy and any humour that might have been around has now evaporated. micky raises his head there is still no damage to speak of. all of a sudden he starts jumping up and down like he's warming up, throwing a few shadow punches, taking off his shirt. this reveals a heavily tattooed and scarred torso, and underneath these embellishments is a physique that warrants some respect.}
<C>__{gorgeous george }
<D>__{this is sick. i am outta here.}
<C>__{micky}
<D>__{you're not going anywhere my friend. you stay until the job is done.}
<A>__{micky starts pacing, and throwing out a couple of shadow punches with his back to gorgeous george, he still hasn't really acknowledged his opponent. gorgeous george moves in for the coup de grace, micky spins on his feet and catches the big man under the jaw.}
