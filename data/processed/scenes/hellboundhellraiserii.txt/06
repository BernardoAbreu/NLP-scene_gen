<A>__{slowly we, the camera, and the officer, move towards the still, silent, but menacing box. we approach it until finally we are above it, looking down into the opening it has made in itself. there is undefined movement inside. suddenly, something flies up directly at us. we glimpse it only briefly, but enough to see its nature. unlike the hooks that flaw at frank in hellraiser, this is more organic than metallic. pink and flesh like but on a long gray blue stalk, it flies upward, its lips peeling apart gapingly to reveal scores of yellow, discoloured, and viciously sharp teeth like hooks. the officer screams and the screen begins to take on a red tint so that, just as the thing is about to fill the screen with its hungry mouth, the entire screen turns red. the red screen is held for a second and then suddenly becomes complete blackness.}
