<LOC>__{EXT. FARM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{It is a hot summer day. A large run down farm house, several sheds, a red roof barn and a decrepid silo sit between fields of dry, uncut grass, in a serene isolated valley. TWO MEN tack together a broken fence that encloses an overgrown paddock. THREE WOMEN work in a vegetable garden. TWO WOMEN hang wet clothes on a clothes line. TWO MEN work in a cluttered garage on an old car. FOUR WOMEN sit in a circle on a broken down, buckling front porch. One woman breast feeds a new born. The others knit a large blanket. TWO WOMEN and TWO MEN swim naked in a swimming hole. A MAN in his forties sits alone in a room reading. A MAN chops wood. A bare foot TODDLER plays alone in the driveway.}

<ACTION>__{A large room with unfinished wood walls has several blankets and pillows laid out like beds on the floor. TWO WOMEN are in the kitchen preparing food. MARTHA, sets a table for eight.

<LOC>__{EXT. FARM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS}
<ACTION>__{Martha walks out the front door, across the porch, and up the driveway. She carries a small bag. Her pace becomes increasingly faster. She looks back to see a teenage girl, SARAH, standing in the window watching. Martha turns and walks faster, heading straight for the woods. As she gets to the edge of the trees she begins to run. SLOW ZOOM: MARTHA DISAPPEARS INTO THE THICK WOODS. Off screen, the house DOOR SLAMS SHUT. A MAN urgently yells out: "MARCY MAY" The camera holds on the trees shaking gently in the wind. For a moment everything is quiet. Suddenly, A MAN and TWO WOMEN enter frame and run into the woods, chasing after Martha.}
<LOC>__{EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS}
<ACTION>__{The woods are dark. Martha runs as fast as she can. She hears the MAN's voice calling her from a distance. A man and two women are chasing her. Martha arrives at a steep heavily wooded hill. She keeps running at full speed, then slips, falls, and rolls. Martha ducks behind a fallen tree and looks back to see the group arrive at the ridge to survey the woods and begin their descent. Martha holds still, listening as the people chasing her pass by.}

He leans down and kisses Martha on the cheek. She doesn't kiss back. He holds his forehead to her forehead until she reacts. She reluctantly kisses him on the lips. Martha watches him walk outside.
