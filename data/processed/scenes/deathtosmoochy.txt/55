<L>__{interior corporate penthouse night}
<A>__{a troubled looking sheldon stands on his balcony looking out at the city. he drinks orange juice straight from the carton. sheldon is on the phone with burke.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{this is unacceptable, burke! i'm calling the authorities.}
<C>__{burke }
<D>__{don't do it, shel. you rat on parade of hope and you'll be lucky if they find your toenails. these guys are the roughest of all the charities.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i was threatened by an organization that's supposed to help children! what kind of world is this?}
<C>__{burke }
<D>__{the real one. my advice? consider the ice show and stay healthy.}
<A>__{burke hangs up. after a beat, sheldon's doorbell rings. he walks over to the door and opens it. to his surprise, nora is standing there.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{may i come in?}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{nora enters. she seems a little wobbly. sheldon notices she's holding a pint of whiskey.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{uh... are you okay?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i'm getting drunk and i'm not used to it.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{oh. well, not to make you feel worse, but with alcohol you're also consuming empty calories.}
<A>__{nora looks at him for a moment.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{it's just that... i want to apologize, actually. and on those rare occasions when i feel the need to apologize for something, it helps if i'm, you know... shit faced.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{wow. i'm honored.}
<A>__{nora trips slightly. sheldon takes the whiskey from her.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{why don't we get some air?}
<A>__{he leads her out on the balcony. they look out at the city.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i... i may have been a little harsh when we spoke the other day. a little out of line.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{well, it wasn't as bad as the week before when you called me a pasty faced, no talent hack.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{yes, that was probably insensitive as well.}
<P>__{(looks at him)}
<D>__{i heard you're not doing the ice show. i find that... incredibly admirable. why didn't you tell me?}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i guess i didn't want to spoil your fun. you look so content when you're berating me.}
<A>__{nora looks down.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i'm afraid i have become a bit hardened over the years. sincerity's an easy disguise in this business. it's hard to know who's on the level.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{believe me, i'm learning that more and more every day.}
<P>__{(wistfully)}
<D>__{'sometimes light is really dark, sometimes crows can sing like larks sometimes winter feels like spring, don't think you know everything.'}
<C>__{nora}
<P>__{(in disbelief)}
<D>__{'rickets the hippo'?}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{you remember rickets?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{that was my favorite show when i was a kid. rickets was the one face i knew i could trust.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{that's how i felt! rickets had real depth. he was my inspiration for smoochy.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{really? he was my inspiration to work in children's television.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i can't believe it. i never met anyone who even remembers rickets. do you remember the klunky wunky dance?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{remember it? i did it at my first communion.}
<A>__{sheldon starts doing the rather insane looking klunky wunky dance. nora does it with him. they both stop and look at each other. sheldon impulsively leans in and kisses her.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i'm sorry. that was a mistake, right? i didn't mean for that to hap }
<A>__{nora grabs his head and pulls it toward her. they begin kissing passionately.}
<C>__{nora}
<P>__{(as they kiss)}
<D>__{you're not full of shit like all the others, are you?}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{no, no.}
<C>__{nora}
<P>__{(as they kiss)}
<D>__{you're for real, right?}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{yes, yes.}
<C>__{nora}
<P>__{(through the kisses)}
<D>__{i mean, i couldn't tell... first i thought it was an act... and then i just thought you were a simp or something...}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{shhh... you don't have to explain...}
<A>__{they continue to kiss. nora abruptly stops.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i should go.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{nora exits the balcony and collects her coat and purse.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{what's wrong? is it the whiskey? if you have to throw up, be my guest. anywhere you like.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{it's just getting late.}
<A>__{sheldon follows her to the door. she stops and looks at him for a moment. the phone starts to ring. neither of them says anything for a beat.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{better get that. good night.}
<A>__{she exits. sheldon shuts the door and sighs. he goes to the bar to pour himself another orange juice before picking up the phone.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{angelo's apartment we go to a horizontal split screen. randolph is on the bottom half. he lies on his bed in angelo's apartment wearing a bathrobe with a towel wrapped around his head. his head dangles off the bed as he talks on the phone. the shot is reminiscent of bye bye birdie.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{hello, mr. mopes? my name is benjamin kunklepeck and i'm calling on behalf of 'parents for decency in children's television,' perhaps you've heard of us?}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{no, but i like where you're coming from. it's an issue very close to my heart. why just yesterday i was commenting }
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{sir, we're having a banquet tomorrow and we'd be honored to have you perform for us. we would also like to present you with a plaque for your ongoing commitment to children's television. the presenter will be a young orphan with mild asthma. can you attend?}
