<L>__{exterior avenue that moment}
<A>__{the joker on the edge of a tantrum as he digs amid the rubble of his float for the remote device. at last he finds it; aims it up at the other balloons in the procession; hits a button repeatedly... ... and howls in frustration. nothing's happening. the damned thing is broken. he heaves it to the street in a fit of pique. a screaming comes across the sky as the batwing swings back for another pass, buzzing the joker at an altitude of twenty feet. sizzling laser fire sweeps the street. cables snap and balloons drift upward as batman's lasers sever their moorings. the joker can only look on helplessly, in stunned disbelief. as he's watching his plans evaporate... his eyes fall on the makeshift bat signal.}
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{there. there. get 'em!!}
<B>__{angle on spotlight truck}
<A>__{a spray of machine gun fire shatters the bat signal. knox throws vicki to the street, ducks down behind the spotlight, and tosses her his car keys.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{get the car!}
<A>__{the joker's goons are coming up fast as vicki reaches the ford, starts it, and comes roaring up toward knox. he jumps off the truck as vicki twists the wheel, lays a track of rubber, and noses the car back in the opposite direction. gunfire as knox jumps inside and they peel out.}
