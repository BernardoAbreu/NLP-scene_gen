<A>__{the struggling porter opens the door and lets jenna in. she walks into the suite and gives it the once over. satisfactory. the porter places her bags on the side and hangs up some of her clothes, desperate to try and get out in one piece... as soon as he's finished he bows and starts to shuffle out of the room.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{hey... open this.}
<A>__{jenna points to the duty free bag then starts running a bath, beginning to undress.}
<C>__{jenna }
<D>__{i need a drink.}
<A>__{the porter is stunned.}
<C>__{jenna }
<D>__{well don't just stand there...}
<A>__{the porter fumbles, taking the gin out of the duty free bag, spilling the tonic in his nervousness as he makes her cocktail. jenna returns in a dressing gown, takes the drink off him and takes a huge slug. the porter is terrified, stunned. rooted to the spot. jenna sits on the bed and stares out of the window. just as the porter thinks it's safe to try edging out of the room again, she starts talking to him...}
<C>__{jenna }
<D>__{i loved him so much you know... billy...}
<A>__{beat. the porter doesn't know what the fuck she's talking about.}

<A>__{she looks over at him. the porter smiles at her.}
<C>__{jenna }
<D>__{do you want to see a picture?}
<A>__{the porter nods, uncertain. jenna gets up, goes over to her purse. opens it up. a picture of billy. she hands it to the porter who takes it and just looks at it, not knowing what to do... jenna starts to cry. for a long time. finally...}
<C>__{porter}
<D>__{madam. i have to return to my station.}
<A>__{jenna snaps out of it in an instant.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{what, yeah, thanks.}
<A>__{she pulls a fifty dollar bill out of her purse. she hands the money to the porter who leaves as quickly as he dares.}
