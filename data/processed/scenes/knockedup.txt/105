<C>__{doorman}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{i know. you're right. i'm so sorry. i fucking hate this job. i don't want to be the one to pass judgement and decide who gets in. this shit makes me sick to my stomach. i get the runs from the stress. it's not because you're not hot. i would love to tap that ass. i would tear that ass up. i can't let you in because you're old as fuck...for this club, not, you know, for the earth.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{doorman}
<D>__{you old. she pregnant. can't have a bunch of old, pregnant bitches running around. that's crazy. i'm only allowed to let in five percent black people. he said that. five percent. that mean if there's twenty five people here, i get to let in one and a quarter black people. so i got to hope there's a black midget in the crowd.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{now i feel guilty. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{doorman}
<D>__{why y'all want to be in here anyway? y'all need to be at a yoga class or something.}
<P>__{(regarding alison)}
<D>__{what the fuck is she doing at the club? that's not even good parenting right there. your old ass should know better than that.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{oh, god. ugh.}
<A>__{debbie takes alison away.}
