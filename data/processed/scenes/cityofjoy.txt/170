<A>__{he is a little delirious. the boys come close, kneel at his side, instinctively reach out to him.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{want you guys to know something. about me. wanted to be the world's greatest heart surgeon, just one better than my dad. just one. first time i'm the lead surgeon on a case, the main guy, i choke. froze. the chief made me step aside. my teacher. had to take over for me. went into radiology. photography. had to have somethin' easy. no pressure. wasn't too nuts about myself. quit.}
<A>__{hasari reaches out and touches max, telling him with a touch that it's all right. he stares up through bleary eyes at all of them with utterly open love. amrita holds out a small gift to him: it's a banana leaf, holding a small scoop of rice and surrounded by little decorative leaves.}

<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i love you guys.}
