<A>__{joachim over his shoulder. others in evidence. khan speaks into his console.}
<C>__{khan}
<D>__{captain... we're waiting. what's the delay?}

<C>__{terrell}
<D>__{all is well, sir. you have the coordinates to beam up genesis...}
<C>__{khan}
<D>__{first things first, captain. kill admiral kirk.}
<A>__{reactions by all only kirk and bones are unsurprised. david and saavik, dazed, fight the urge to do something. chekov is close to a seizure. terrell fights conflicting mental signals.}
<C>__{terrell}
<D>__{excellency... it is difficult. i try to obey, but }
<C>__{khan's voice}
<D>__{kill him .}
<A>__{as though tearing off a leach, terrell grabs at the wrist recorder and flings it to the ground. a shock wave of pain hits terrell. he recovers, trembling and tries to obey. chekov is shaking badly. terrell aims his phaser at kirk. chekov slowly raises his phaser and aims at terrell, though his hands are like lead. we think chekov is going to do the right thing. then, shockingly: terrell turns his phaser on himself.}
<C>__{khan's voice}
<P>__{(still emanates from wrist recorder)}
<D>__{kill him, terrell. now.}
<A>__{terrell does, blowing himself into oblivion. angle favoring chekov he screams, horribly, drops his phaser, clutching his head. bones leaps to his side, pulls an injection device from his belt pack, jabs it into chekov's arm. chekov, almost with a sigh of relief, drops.}
<C>__{khan's voice}
<D>__{terrell? chekov !}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{jim for god's sake!}
<A>__{they rush to his side, as do carol and david. angle favoring chekov from the fallen man's ear, something begins to emerge. very close chekov's ear the ceti eel crawls out. it has grown quite large.}
<B>__{scene}
<A>__{horror from all. kirk picks up a phaser. as the eel clears chekov, he fires and destroys it. he shudders, then sees the wrist recorder and grabs it.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{khan, you bloodsucker, they're finished! you'll have to do your own dirty work now. do you hear me do you ?}
