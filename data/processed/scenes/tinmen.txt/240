<L>__{interior tobacco warehouse day}
<A>__{the home improvement commission is in session. tilley and sam sit at the defense table. masters presides over the commission table where four or five other commis sioners sit.}
<C>__{masters}
<P>__{(into microphone to tilley & sam)}
<D>__{didn't you approach mr. boloshevski august 18, 1961, while he was cutting his front lawn and tell him that his house had been selected, as one of only 16 homes in the state of maryland, for a free aluminum siding job?}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{what's the name again?}
<C>__{masters}
<D>__{boloshevski.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{doesn't ring a bell.}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{sam, does it ring a bell to you?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(leans into microphone)}
<D>__{it doesn't ring a bell to me either, sir.}
<C>__{masters}
<D>__{didn't you suggest that for a nominal labor charge, he would receive over five thousand dollars' worth of aluminum siding?}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{that's an awful lot for nothing. doesn't sound like good business to me.}
<C>__{masters}
<D>__{mr. boloshevski was ultimately charged twenty four hundred dollars for labor, which according to our figures is about the average cost of an aluminum siding job.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(leans into the microphone)}
<D>__{i don't get the point of this.}
<C>__{masters}
<D>__{twenty four hundred dollars that you charged for labor, is the same as if mr. boloshevski had purchased the aluminum siding and had the labor done.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{maybe i'm missing the point here, but if he paid twenty four hundred, which is the cost of the job, i can't see anything wrong with that. i don't know the guy, but i don't quite get the problem.}
<C>__{masters}
<D>__{what we're getting at here... what we're trying to stress, is that the job was sold under false terms. the man didn't win any award... he was not getting aluminum siding at a special price. a clear case of deception was involved here.}
<C>__{tilley}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{what's he talking about? the man got the job for twenty four hundred dollars, and that's what it costs in aluminum siding.}
<C>__{tilley }
<P>__{(leans into microphone)}
<D>__{um... i don't know... we have no recollection of this particular job, but i don't know if this is deception. look, if you work in a clothing store, some guy tries on a suit, it looks like shit, but you tell him it looks wonderful. the guy's standing there looking like a sack of shit, the salesman says what a great suit and the man buys it. that's deception as far as i can see, but i don't understand the deceptiveness that you say we're responsible for... if i make myself clear.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(leaning into the microphone)}
<D>__{i'd go along with that as well.}
<C>__{masters}
<D>__{what we're trying to establish are the principles that have been laid down as part of the home improvement code of ethics... that you cannot mislead someone intentionally, and i think that's the principle that applies to this.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{did somebody put a gun to this guy's head and make him spend twenty four hundred dollars? i don't get the point here. i don't know the specifics of this case, not being privy to all the information, but all i can say is this guy got a fair price for a fair job.}
<A>__{another commissioner, bud delaney, takes the microphone.}
<C>__{delaney}
<P>__{(to tilley)}
<D>__{do you know mr. and mrs. rayburn of 156 aberdeen avenue, essex?}
<C>__{tilley}
<P>__{(looks to sam}
<D>__{and shrugs his shoulders; then}
<P>__{into mike)}
<D>__{i think you'd have to familiarize me.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{the couple purchased twenty eight hundred dollars' worth of aluminum siding and the two of you were the salesmen on record. they say, and i quote here, 'that they would have received one hundred and fifty dollars per home for every person in the neighborhood who saw their house and decided to buy aluminum siding.'}
<P>__{(looking up from paper)}
<D>__{is that true?}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{it sounds right.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{are you aware that, according to the home improvement code, you are not allowed to exceed a twenty dollar limit in incentives?}
<C>__{tilley}
<P>__{(shrugs his shoulders)}
<D>__{we wanted to be a little more generous, that's all.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{the couple said that they never did receive any money from any other jobs, as you had promised.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(leaning into microphone)}
<D>__{we didn't get any leads from them. their house was not the showplace that we thought it would be. it didn't generate the activity that we had hoped.}
<C>__{tilley}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{but should a referral turn up in the community, we'd be more than happy to give them twenty dollars instead of the hundred and fifty.}
<C>__{masters}
<P>__{(leaning into microphone)}
<D>__{excuse us for one moment.}
<A>__{he then leans over to delaney, and they start to confer. tilley and sam watch, wondering what's going on. masters leans in the other direction, holding his hand over the microphone, and he talks to the other commissioners. they nod in approval, then masters leans back into the microphone.}
<C>__{masters}
<D>__{thank you very much, gentlemen. should there be a reason in the future to call you back, we would like to reserve that right.}
<C>__{tilley}
<P>__{(leans into microphone)}
<D>__{glad we could be of some service.}
<A>__{tilley and sam get up from the table and walk out of the building.}
