<A>__{in the tribunal room night as he continues we move down a row of stern monk faces, ending at the abbots...}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{you heard brother graham tell of the devil inside sheep's wool }
<A>__{he motions towards the hysterical monk, sitting in the crowd.}

<C>__{bald tribunal monk}
<D>__{evil.}
<A>__{ripley turns to the abbot.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{yes, the ship brought it. not evil. it brought the alien. i told you, it's here.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{we know the name of the evil it brought. it brought technology. technology to destroy our planet, as surely as it destroyed the earth.}
<C>__{monk in audience}

<A>__{the abbot smiles to himself for making her crack. he stands and begins to pace.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{you could not have been on the earth a year ago, because there is no earth to be on for at least twenty years.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i haven't been floating in space for twenty years. let me get to my ship and i will prove it.}
<C>__{bald tribunal monk}
<D>__{no. who knows what new evils she'll release if allowed back into that infernal machine.}
<C>__{monk in audience}
<D>__{no! don't let her!!}
<C>__{tribunal member}
<D>__{this woman is a danger. she denies the new dark age. she denies reality.}

<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{who are you people? look at you all of you the way you're dressed. this isn't the middle ages. you're in space on a artifical planet. what are you doing out here?}
