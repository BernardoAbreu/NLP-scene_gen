<L>__{interior basement gym, boxing ring day}
<A>__{mills opens a door and enters with somerset behind. they are alone. chairs face an old, limp roped boxing ring. practice pads hang from pegs on a wall. mills clasps a pair in his gloves, offers them to somerset.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{you just hold them up. i do all the work.}
<A>__{somerset takes the pads reluctantly, puts them on. he still has the un lit cigarette hanging from his mouth. mills climbs into the ring. he holds the ropes open for somerset, waits. somerset doesn't want to do this, but he climbs up.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{you've seen my files... seen the things i've done?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{yes. impressive work.}
<A>__{mills motions to somerset and somerset holds up the practice pads. mills starts working them, lightly, warming up.}
<B>__{thwack... thwack...}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{so, what's your problem? i've done my time on door to doors, and walking a beat.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i know it. that doesn't mean...}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i did all that shit a long time ago.}
<A>__{thwack... thwack... somerset's very stiff, uncomfortable.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i made a decision, because i have to worry about the integrity of the scene.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{that's bullshit.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{when i'm on scene, i'm not going to worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field. i'm there to do the work.}
<A>__{mills punches a little more aggressively. somerset's backing, flinching, keeping the pads high. thwack... thwack... thwack...}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{the badge in my pocket says "detective," just like yours. i've been homicide for four and a half years.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{you've worked homicide for four years, or for five years... don't count the half years, unless you want to sound like a rookie.}
<A>__{mills unloads a mighty wallop and one practice pad recoils into somerset's face, knocks somerset on his ass.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{oops. my hand slipped.}
<A>__{mills walks, climbs out of the ring.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{you fucked me over today, and you know it. you know it.}
<A>__{somerset looks at the broken cigarette in his mouth. he contains his anger. he seems to realize mills has a pointerior}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{just don't jerk me off. that's all i ask. it's not much. don't jerk me off.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{please, do me the favor of remembering that.}
<A>__{mills exits. somerset spits out the broken cigarette.}
