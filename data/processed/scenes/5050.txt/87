<A>__{adam sits up and looks at katie.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i'm not getting any better.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{don't say that, you're doing so well.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{did you know that they found a quasar 7 billion light years away? 7 billion light years! it's more than 3 billion years older than our planet, and we're just seeing it now; and you think i'm going to live?}
<C>__{katie}
<P>__{(totally baffled)}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{cancer is an epidemic! it killed alan, it's going to kill me, and it's going to kill millions more after me. there's nothing anybody can do.}

<D>__{this is really good adam. let it out.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{will you stop!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i can't do this anymore. it doesn't matter. none of it. i'm going to die and with nothing to show for my life. 100 years from now my legacy be will be that of just another person dead of cancer. that's it.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{this helplessness you're feeling is normal. these emotions you're holding onto are what make you human. but it doesn't mean you can just stop living your life.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{look at how you've grown over the past few months, you can't just throw it all away...talk to me.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i know you're only trying to help, but this isn't working for me anymore.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{adam leaves. katie is left feeling as though she failed.}
