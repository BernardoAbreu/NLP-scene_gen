<L>__{exterior black cove farm. spring. day}
<A>__{everywhere signs of profound neglect, like a grimm's fairy tale of a deserted house. the fields are overgrown with weeds, the gardens abandoned. the chickens have deserted the henhouse and are wandering around the outbuildings, scuffing at the packed dirt. sally and esco come up the overgrown path, avoiding the chickens, and knock at the door.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{ada! ada, it's sally.}
<A>__{they're seen from ground level, through a boxwood, as their feet patrol the ground, turn away from the door, and then retreat, their voices drifting away. ada is there, crouching in her hidey hole, a blanket on the ground, her book. she wants to reveal herself, but is too embarrassed.}
<C>__{esco}
<D>__{will you look at the state of this place!}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{poor soul. she's got nobody and nothing and three hundred acres of misery.}
<A>__{during this a rooster, black and gold, struts into the boxwood. as the rooster approaches, ada shudders, tries to shoo it away without alerting her presence. ada peers through the boxwood as sally and esco close the gate and recede. the rooster comes at her again. she rises up, kicking out at it, while he flares his wings, spurs flaying at her. ada runs from the boxwood, tormented by the triumphant rooster, which continues to fly and scratch, driving her into the house.}
