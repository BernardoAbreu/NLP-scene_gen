<L>__{interior middle suburban, riyadh suburbs night}
<A>__{the speedometer at 110 m.p.h. haytham navigates with his left hand. prayer beads hang from the rearview mirror. al ghazi in the passenger seat, right hand rubbing another set of prayer beads down to nubs. the team in the back rows: all staring at the prayer beads on the mirror.}
<C>__{janet mayes}
<P>__{(whispering to leavitt)}
<D>__{wouldn't need the power a' prayer if there were 2 hands on the wheel.}
<C>__{adam leaviit}
<D>__{110 miles per hour... how do you keep so calm? i mean, really? is it breathing }
<C>__{janet mayes}
<D>__{ shhhh....}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{if somebody was tailing us it'd be obvious. this is just standard operating speed.}
<A>__{al ghazi on the edge of his seat, no belt, scanning for threats: sidewalks, traffic, rooftops. his left hand hand wrapped around the stock of an mp 5 machine gun. fleury takes in a deep breath: let's see who this guy is.}
<C>__{ronald fleury }
<D>__{colonel, have you ever been to the us? colonel al ghazi i have been there only once. i spent four days at quantico... i saw your michael jordan play for the washington wizards.}
<A>__{small laughs.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{you don't know what you missed... you should have seen him play for our chicago bulls.}
<A>__{fleury nods to sykes, giving him the go to start in with the bad cop. throughout the following exchange, we stay tight on fleury: in control, using sykes to ask the questions he "diplomatically" does not want to ask.}
<C>__{grant sykes}
<D>__{you have portable lights on scene? colonel al ghazi}
<P>__{(loses his smile)}
<D>__{yes. but your team cannot work nights.}
<A>__{janet looks to leavitt, then fleury: `what did he say?' fleury looks to sykes, `keep going...'}
<C>__{grant sykes}
<D>__{we only have seven days: we work around the clock. colonel al ghazi five days. and you are not safe at night.}
<C>__{grant sykes}
<D>__{we're safe during the day?}
<A>__{fleury is about to step in when }
<D>__{colonel al ghazi}
<P>__{(in arabic, shocking)}
<D>__{watch it slow!}
<A>__{a truck 200 yards ahead in the middle of an abrupt u turn. over the median. dust cloud. heading back our way. something big in the truck's bed. our vehicle shimmies as al ghazi flinches, drops his prayer beads. mp 5 up to the colonel's sight line, muzzle tracking the truck. leavitt leans away from his window as the vehicles pass: streetlights show two farmers, a camel sitting in the bed. missed their left turn. a long, nearly comical moment.}
<C>__{adam leavitt}
<P>__{(smartass)}
<D>__{i don't like camels.}
<A>__{fleury cycling through different angles. continues:}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{colonel, do you believe abu hamza was responsible for this attack? colonel al ghazi we don't know.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{were saudi police involved in the attack? colonel al ghazi we don't know that either.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{any word on what that third big blast was?}
<A>__{al ghazi getting tired of the questions: exhausted himself.}
<D>__{colonel al ghazi not yet.}
<C>__{grant sykes}
<D>__{you interviewed witnesses? colonel al ghazi}
<P>__{(short fuse burning)}
<D>__{we're trying. no one who was close enough to see the things we would like to know, lived.}
<C>__{grant sykes}
<D>__{were any of the uniformed bombers brother officers?}
<A>__{no answer.}
<C>__{grant sykes }
<D>__{do you know yet?}
<A>__{no answer. team feeling the tension. fleury steps in and takes charge.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{you don't know the source of the blast, don't know if your own officers were involved, but you won't let us work nights?}
<A>__{al ghazi stanches an explosion. haytham looks over at his colonel: rarely ever seen him like this. looks in the rear view mirror to see sykes, the man giving the colonel fits. sykes catches him looking back, gives him a quick wink into the mirror. tight on haytham's face: the guilty little smile you give when someone takes your boss to task.}
<D>__{colonel al ghazi 47 of my `brother officers' were blown into hundreds of pieces that will take months to collect. 80,000 officers total, across the country, at four uniforms apiece. thousands of people who can sew forgeries. apologies that i don't have definitive answers.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you're still not working nights.}
<A>__{fleury stays quiet, studying, calculating, thinking: we got a handler that's going to be tough to handle.}
