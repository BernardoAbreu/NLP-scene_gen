<A>__{miranda (with her fresh new bandage) ignores the looks from the other patients as she rejoins them. spots shelley by the window furthest from the wardens. scared.}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{oh my god. oh my god.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{you saw it?}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{listen, doctor. some people, they have a gift. and in here, because they categorize us as a bunch of schizos, they refuse to acknowledge that. it's like that hubble telescope that sees things a trillion miles away but what it's seeing is just reflected light of a star that died a thousand years ago? it's like that. doesn't mean you're crazy. it only means your eyes open in a different way.}
<A>__{miranda tries to follow the convoluted explanation, but has a sinking feeling.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{what did it say?}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{on the telescope?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{did you see anything, shelley?}
<A>__{shelley glances around to make sure no one can hear.}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{that's not tile that wall is made out of . it's a holographic screen. all part of your mission, isn't it?}
<A>__{miranda shakes her head, feeling foolish. walks away.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{thanks anyway.}
<C>__{shelley}
<P>__{(taps her forehead)}
<D>__{this is all we have. the rest is dust.}
