<L>__{exterior woodland road day}
<A>__{abby is concerned as the horse slows to a trot.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{we can't stop now. they'll be coming after us.}
<A>__{the postman's head lolls forward. she feels something on her hand, pulls it back smeared with blood. the postman's shot in the belly. the horse is failing. near death. we hear the sound of pursuing cavalry. abby urges the horse off the road. when the thicket grows too dense, abby jumps down. she catches the postman as he slides off, easing him to the ground.}
<C>__{the postman}
<P>__{(disoriented)}
<D>__{abby...}
<A>__{abby shushes him. she pulls on the horse's bridle to force him farther along. but it's no good, the wounded horse goes down on its knees. and five riders thunder past. fooled. all but the sixth, who pulls up to listen. in the deep b.g., flames lick at the billowing black smoke. the town is burning. the horse whinnies: in its death throes. abby panics, tries to quiet the horse. the sixth soldier has heard the suffering horse. he draws his rifle from the saddle boot and starts into the thicket.}
<B>__{on abby and postman}
<A>__{the postman lies unconscious on the ground. abby sits beside him, rifle in hand. the sixth soldier appears.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{don't move.}
<A>__{he hesitates at first. then dismounts and moves toward her. abby cocks the rifle.}
<C>__{sixth soldier}
<D>__{if you'd had a bullet, you'd a used it by now.}
<A>__{moving closer still, he doesn't see the branch pulled back in the postman's hand until it snaps hard into his face. he stumbles back.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you're right.}
<A>__{abby dashes out, rifle in hand. she swings for the bleachers. the butt catches the side of the sixth soldier's head. he falls hard. the postman's eyes flutter. dazed, he watches as abby pilfers through the soldier's gear. she takes everything of value: a knife, bullets, a canteen. his eyes flutter closed.}
