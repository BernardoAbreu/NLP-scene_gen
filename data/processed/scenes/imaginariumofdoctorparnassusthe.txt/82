<L>__{ext strange mountain landscape}
<A>__{dr. parnassus is sitting alone on a prominent bluff (the same one he tried throwing himself off many years ago) he's distraught. tears run down this cheeks. a distant bell tolls midnight. mr nick appears behind parnassus...sits down beside him.}
<C>__{mr nick}
<D>__{funny how things work out, isn't it?}
<A>__{he lights a cigarette.}
<C>__{mr nick }
<D>__{it's not what i had in mind y'know... this.. valentina, being the fifth... it doesn't seem right... she's supposed to be the prize, the star prize... not part of the bloody score... and you lumbered with eternal life all over again... what a bummer, eh?}
<A>__{no response from parnassus. a tarot cards drops from his hand. it is the hanged man. mr. nick points to the plain far below. across the harsh ground, tony is running for his life...pursued by the mob.}
<C>__{mr nick }
<D>__{i hope they get that bastard. tear him limb from limb... but they won't... he leads a charmed life, that one... i've been trying to nail him for years... i thought i had him this time. but, there's always some prat comes to his rescue... talk about the luck of the devil.}
<P>__{(he laughs)}
<D>__{those weird markings you found on him... on his forehead... those satanic symbol, so called, things... what's all that about?... maybe they protect him in some way... i've never been into that black magic stuff myself... can't seem to get the hang of it... i know, pathetic isn't it?...}
<A>__{parnassus ignores him, sunk even deeper into despondency.}
<C>__{mr nick }
<D>__{god, i hate to see you like this. look, i tell you what... if you can get the lowdown on those satanic markings, or.. wait.. better still, if you can wipe that self righteous little creep off the face of the universe... i will give you valentina back.}
<A>__{a beat. slowly, parnassus looks up.}
<C>__{mr nick }
<D>__{how about it?}
