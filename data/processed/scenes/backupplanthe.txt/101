<L>__{interior lori's apartment night}
<A>__{there are candles everywhere and a table of food and drinks. kind of like a birthing cocktail party. zoe eats a brownie. carol approaches with lori, who is wearing a caftan and rubbing her large stomach. they all hug.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{zoe, it's so nice of you to come, especially at this crazy hour.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{you're really one of us now.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{are you sure you're in labor? you're so calm.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{oh, i'm sure.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{well, i just wanted to come and say a quick hi and good luck.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{you're not staying?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{you have to stay. lori wants us all to be together for this.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{well, i really want to be here but...um, the truth is...actually i've been wanting to tell you guys for a while but, the truth is...}
<A>__{lori drops her head on zoe's shoulder and lets out a giant moan. it's long and it's awkward.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{she's having a contraction.}
<A>__{zoe nods. this is weird. lori breathes through it.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{okay. what was it you were saying?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i'm back with stan.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{stan who?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{the farmer?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{actually, he makes cheese. he named a cheese after me. isn't that romantic? sort of?}
<P>__{(off their blank stares)}
<D>__{well, anyway, i'm not technically a single mother by choice anymore. so, if you want me to leave right now, i totally understand. i will just walk out the door and }
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{no, i really want you to stay.}
<C>__{zoe}
<P>__{(bummed)}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{listen, zoe, if you're happy, we're happy. we'd love to meet him. bring him to group any time.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{well, actually, he's downstairs, so i should probably get back to }
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{great. invite him up.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{oh, no, no, no...}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{i'm not shy. i've been through this before. it's quite beautiful, really.}
<A>__{zoe stands there trying to come up with another excuse. after a few moments, it's clear that she cannot.}
