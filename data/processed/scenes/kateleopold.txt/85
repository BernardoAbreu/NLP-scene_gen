<L>__{interior dining room night}
<A>__{leopold talks animatedly. on the table pumpkin pies, pizza pies, and pot pies.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i understand pumpkin pies, pizza pies, and pot pies. but i wish someone would explain eskimo pies.}
<A>__{he eats a large spoonful of pudding. kate and charlie exchange a worried look.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{you smoke camel's, you wear old spices, and you drink mountains dew. it's revolting.}
<P>__{(to kate)}
<D>__{the pudding tonight is excellent. another thing i've noticed, everyone is in a great rush today. instant oatmeal, instant coffee, speed stick, minute maid. you'll find there's much to be said for moderation and languor.}
<A>__{he eats another spoonful.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{mmmm. is it tapioca?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{it's margarine.}
<C>__{leopold}
<P>__{(taking the spoon out of his mouth)}
<D>__{it's marvelous.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well, i'm off.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{me too. work to do. where are you going?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm meeting everyone over at caffeine. it's this coffee house we go to.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{say hello to dennis for me.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{who is that?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{dennis is this really good looking friend of mine who doesn't know kate's alive because she doesn't know how to flirt.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{as a rule i don't like to associate with really good looking people. it makes me feel really... i don't know... smart. but dennis is a nice guy.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{and he always picks up the check.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{sounds enjoyable. i shall join you.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{that's a wonderful idea! leopold mentioned how he wanted to meet... people of quality was it?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{ahhhhh?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{if you'd rather i didn't go...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{nonsense! charlie, you don't want to hurt leopold's feelings. he's going to think you don't want him to go.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{oh it's not that. it's just that it's sort of a vulgar crowd, is all. i'm not sure you'd have such a good time.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{a little ribald humor? i'm not as big a stick in the mud as you might think! i'd enjoy a gay night out, kicking up my heels.}
<A>__{there is an awkward pause. leopold is so enthusiastic and sincere that despite a feeling of disaster charlie relents.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{finish off your parquet and we'll go.}
<A>__{charlie gives kate a look of death as we:}
