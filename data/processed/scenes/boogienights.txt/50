<A>__{jack and the colonel are sitting, drinks in their hand. the colonel smokes a cigar.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the idea is this: amber is a director of porno films and she's down on her luck. she hasn't had a hit in a year. she's desperate. her landlord is threatening to kick her out, so she's desperate for a big dick hit, right?}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{yes. good dilemma.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yes. so she calls up all the agencies in town and says: "send over your best actors, i'm casting a porno picture." well, the story goes and develops with amber auditioning various men and women . . . the whole thing wraps up with the landlord, i'd like to get jeremy if he's still in town to play the part he comes in the landlord says: you better pay rent or you're through. well, amber does one helluva suck job, ass fuck, come in the face, sort of thing and fade out the end.}

<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{what films has he done?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this would be his first.}
<A>__{little bill pokes his head into the office, sees the conversation and quickly apologizes and exits. the colonel looks to jack;}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{casting is up to you, jack. you wanna do it? then do it. if it has big tits, tight pussy and focus: i'm happy. you tell the stories you wanna tell, make yourself happy.}
