<L>__{exterior the beach. the past. day}
<A>__{emma lies on a rug, her head is in darwin's lap. she is reading aloud from a new book of poems by wordsworth.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{"loving she is, and tractable though wild. and innocence hath privilege in her. to dignify arch looks and laughing eyes; and feats of cunning; and the pretty round of trespasses, affected to provoke mock chastisement, and partnership in play"}
<A>__{she puts the book down}
<C>__{darwin}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{then we were wrong. she is not unique after all.}
<A>__{darwin is watching annie dancing in front of the surf , turning cartwheels a wild dancing sprite of the sea, oblivious to the cold, shouting and singing:}
<B>__{the beach. later}
<A>__{later, near the cliff, darwin is "geologising" he's excited, breathless and windswept, shouting over the sound of the nearby surf as he clambers over the huge assorted boulders pointing out the geological strata to his kids who are more interested in clambering.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{this is devonian, about 400 million years ago. rocks like this might have fishes in them, trilobites, tree ferns, corals maybe....}
<A>__{he knock off a corner of rock with his geological hammer, then moves on}
<C>__{etty}
<D>__{is this a bit?}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{no that is cretaceous etty. it was made a hundred millions years ago, when this cliff was a coral reef and down village was a swamp full of great crocodiles.}
<A>__{tap tap tap with his hammer as the boys scramble upwards, playing at mountaineers.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{we might find oysters and sponges imprinted in it, or dinosaurs if we were lucky...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what's a dinosaur?}
<C>__{etty}
<D>__{professor owen invented them.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{they are the giant lizards which lived on earth before there were any humans.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{but they weren't real}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{of course they are, betty. did i never tell you of the skeletons i found in south america}
<P>__{(to etty)}
<D>__{do you remember mr martell?}
<C>__{etty}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{annie arrives, hopping nimbly over the rocks still in her wet swimsuit}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{yes you do. when he came to tea and showed us drawings of his iguanodon. and george burnt his fingers roasting chestnuts.}
<C>__{etty}
<D>__{oh yes.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{she doesn't remember.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{you should have your clothes on annie. you are quite blue.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{savages don't swear clothes.}
<A>__{she runs to the top of a great fallen rock, spreads her arms out, and yells to the sky.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i'm a fuegan.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{well don't fall and hurt yourself. your mother would never forgive me.}
<A>__{annie gives a shout and disappears head over heels.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{annie!}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i've found one!}
<A>__{in the rubble at the base of the rocks she has landed, unhurt and quite by accident on a perfect specimen of a fossilized trilobite.}
