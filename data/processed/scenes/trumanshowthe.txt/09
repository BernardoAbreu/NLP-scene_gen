<L>__{interior schoolroom. day, twenty seven years earlier.}
<A>__{once again, the flashback appears to be playing on a television screen. the sandy haired seven year old truman sits in the middle row of a catholic elementary school classroom surrounded by thirty or so other well scrubbed, uniformed youngsters. douglas, the boy next to truman is on his feet under the scrutiny of a sixty year old nun with a face as wrinkled as her habit is starched.}
<C>__{douglas}
<D>__{i wanna be a chiropractor like my dad.}
<C>__{sister}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{tell the class what a chiropractor does, douglas.}
<C>__{douglas}
<D>__{he helps people by fixing their backs, sister olivia.}
<C>__{sister}
<D>__{that's right, douglas.}
<P>__{(holding her back, hamming it up)}
<D>__{perhaps i will be your first patient.}
<A>__{the class titters. douglas sits down, pleased with himself, throwing a smirk to truman.}
<C>__{sister}
<D>__{what about you, truman?}
<A>__{truman rises to his feet.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{i want to be an explorer}
<P>__{(with reverence)}
<D>__{...like magellan.}
<A>__{the sister's face falls.}
<C>__{sister}
<D>__{no one's going to pay you to do that, truman.}
<P>__{(with scarcely disguised glee)}
<D>__{besides, you're too late. there's nothing left to explore.}
<A>__{the class roars with laughter and truman takes his seat.}
