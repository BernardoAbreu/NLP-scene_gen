<L>__{interior hogan}
<A>__{thomas's sitting on the hard packed floor, leaning against the adobe wall, maybe trying to sleep. mostly trying to ignore the thumping pain in his head. the oil lamp's flame shudders in the gust of katherine opening the door.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{is it over?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{for now. they start again tomorrow.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{and at the end of it?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{the enemy way chant removes the invading yei ghost.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{will it work on a general's soul?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{we'll see.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{how's the head?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{still attached. barely.}
<A>__{she sits down on the floor beside him.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{here, i will change the bandage.}
<A>__{she carefully unwraps the blood soaked gauze.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{does that hurt?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{then i must be doing it wrong.}
<A>__{she peels back the compress and dabs the wound.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{i saw the devil tonight.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{how nice. which one?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{the main one. satan. lucifer. the dark angel. you know.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{what did he have to say?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{that he did it all for love. that and i have a choice. mary's life or a billion souls waiting in the pipeline for heavenland to open.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{you're not kidding, are you?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{no sir.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{satan? you're sure?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{you had to be there.}
<A>__{thomas suddenly slams his fist against the wall in anger.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{why wasn't i!}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{we can double date next time if it's that important to you.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{you don't understand, i've spent my whole life...}
<P>__{(looks upward)}
<D>__{i don't suppose it would occur to anyone in authority to fill me in on what's going on every once in awhile, huh? shit!}
<A>__{the ache in his head's flared up. he leans it back against the wall to ease the pain.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{did he say anything about the nicene council? about the rank of jesus christ in the holy trinity?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{it didn't seem important to him.}
<A>__{katherine finishes taping the new bandage.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{are you a priest?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{a near miss.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{it's a long story.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{this may be your last chance to tell it.}
<A>__{a wind outside rustles through the hogans.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{the other night, you were talking about waiting for a voice to call you to something. well, let me tell you, the worst thing that can happen to you is to be called to something. since i can remember a voice from somewhere deep in the church called me. so loud and so often that by thirteen i knew i was going to be a priest. you know what that's like? my parents, friends, all of them thought i was crazy. but see, i had this voice. the voice that kept coaxing me along, telling me there was a reason. so i entered the seminary and was half way to my starched white collar when my mother, father, and my little brother were wiped out in a car crash.}
<A>__{he pauses, the old emotions creeping back up on him.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{i had never asked anything of the voice. not when the neighborhood kids made fun of me, not when my father looked down at me like some knock kneed faggot. i never questioned a damn thing. but on the morning i spent looking down at three parallel graves, i asked it one question. why. why were these people taken from me? and the voice, that same voice that would wrench me out of my sleep some nights with its jabbering, it was suddenly stone silent. it was the only question i ever asked of it and it just left me hanging in the fucking wind...}
<A>__{he blinks back the tears welling in his eye.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{so after that i traded in priest school for homicide school. because if god wouldn't talk to me the devil sure as hell would, and his ways were a lot easier to understand.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{we've never seen god, have we? not in any of this.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{yeah, he's certainly a shy son of a bitch, i will give him that.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{maybe we're not supposed to. maybe that's faith.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{do you still have faith in anything, katherine?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{i have faith in mary. and that i'm going to save that little girl from those creeping things out there. from all of them.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{maybe you were called to something after all.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{maybe we both were.}
<A>__{the oil lamp wanes and fades. katherine lays her head on thomas's shoulder, and as darkness swallows them he holds her. they hold each other.}
