<L>__{interior office building day}
<A>__{cavernous modern lobby. bodies cramming into elevators. bud, stuffing the newspaper into his coat, jams in.}
<L>__{interior elevator morning}
<A>__{blank faces stare ahead, each lost in private thoughts, bud again mouthing the thought, "stupid schmuck", his eyes catching a blond executive who quickly flicks her eyes away. paranoia in the elevator. we quickly cut into private lives.}
<C>__{worried man }
<D>__{... he'll sue me, could be for 5 6 million, and he'll get a million, the house, they'll impound my paychecks...damn, damn, why did i sign that contract?}
<C>__{black bike messenger }
<D>__{... gotta get lola in the sack man, take her to the garden for the terrells, jimmy give me the tickets for 12 bucks, i pull the midnight shift, i could do 60 bucks... wow, check those legs out...}
<A>__{his eyes on the same blonde exec who looks away, self conscious about her legs. the elevator stops at a floor, discards only one person. the doors close a little too slowly.}
<C>__{blonde executive }
<D>__{... jerk...}
<P>__{(shifts her thoughts)}
<D>__{call hanratty. the decimal points on the code are uncalibrated. hoskins. the signatures on the bank draft. boyle, that bitch...insurance...tax form. shit, talk to kahn.}
<P>__{(recalling)}
<D>__{that's hanratty, hoskins, bank, boyle and kahn... h2b2k shoot, insurance and theatre tix...h2b2k,i,t and the cleaners! repeat...}
<A>__{catching the eyes of bud fox once again wandering to her. camera moving to bud who looks away.}
<C>__{bud }
<D>__{...sorry, what a fox... funny, the most beautiful girls in the world are always on the street or in elevators, never get to talk to them, shy ... my looks, never had confidence in them ... overcompensating work syndrome... prove your worth with money... 'cept i'm not making any money...}
<P>__{(pause, the elevator at another floor, slow)}
<D>__{... wonder what all these people are thinking about.}
<A>__{camera moving slowly again over the eyes. the silence of individual tension reigns over all.}
<C>__{angry man }
<D>__{...screw him! i will destroy that sonufabitch... he thinks he can break a contract with me he's got something to learn.}
<C>__{secretary }
<D>__{...9:15!... he'll kill me this time, he will really kill me... oh come on elevator!... why do you stop on every floor...}
<A>__{as the elevator stops again to disgorge two people.}
<C>__{bike messenger }
<P>__{(pissed now at the elevator)}
<D>__{... come on man, time is money man... one floor here i could do eleven blocks...}
<C>__{blonde executive }
<D>__{h2b2k,i,t,cl,p,o,t2...}
<P>__{(pause, she looks like she forgot something)}
<C>__{worried man }
<D>__{...goddamn elevators!...people, too many goddamn people in this world!}
<A>__{the elevator finally comes to a slow stop... they wait, plead, beg, screech with the eyes. the door at last opens. none of them acknowledging each other, they all stampede out the door with an audible gasp of release, a collective sign akin to making it to a urinal after a punishing wait... the elevator tension is over, but the killer grind continues.}
