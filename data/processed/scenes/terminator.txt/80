<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{reese emerges from a stairwell behind a service station, his overcoat done up to the top button. he walks through the sparse morning crowd on the cluttered, overbuilt commercial street. he is out of sync. a stranger in a strange land. he holds himself tightly reined, cautious and feral as he moves among the unconcerned pedestrians. his eyes flick rapidly about. he is seeing this babylon for the first time. reese stops at a hole in the wall take out stand. he watches people walk away with food. moves closer. scrutinizes the next man as he orders.}
<D>__{take out customer gimme a falafel with yogurt dressing and, uh, baco bits.}
<A>__{the counterman hands him his food and change wordlessly as reese steps up.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{gimme a falafel with, uh, yogurt and baco bits.}
<A>__{the counterman barely looks up as he passes the mess through the window.}
<C>__{counterman}
<D>__{that'll be one sixty.}
<A>__{he glances up and reese is gone. he leans half out the window.}
<C>__{counterman}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hey! son of a bitch.}
