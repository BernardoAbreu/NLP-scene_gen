<L>__{interior selina's loft night}
<A>__{soft music plays in the background as selina preens in front of a vanity, doing her eye makeup, taking great pleasure in her own reflection. she's looking especially sultry tonight in a glittering low cut gown. she lowers one shoulder strap and strikes a pose in the mirror: better. she runs a hand through her hair, tousling it for that recently ravished look. the doorbell rings, and by the time selina crosses over to answer it, she's lowered the other strap as well which means she has to hold up the top of her dress with one hand. bruce finds himsell dumbstruck as she lets him in. she pulls up both straps as she greets him nonchalantly:}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{you're early. i'm afraid i'm not quite dressed.}
<A>__{bruce enters and takes a long look around. it's a big open loft, only partly finished, filled with egyptian artifacts. the walls feature modern paintings with cat motifs. the finished section is dominated by a huge bed on a raised platform three or four cats are walking around on it, yowling at bruce. selina chuckles as he scopes it all out.}
<C>__{selina }
<D>__{if you're looking for my bondage gear, it's at the cleaners.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{christmas eve. no tree?}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{no presents. i've been a bad girl this year.}
<A>__{bruce takes a seat on the sofa while selina goes to a nearby wet bar.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i'm surprised you kept this date. i thought you would've lost interest by now.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{what makes you say that?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{you've got what you want, don't you?}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{i do now.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{we've had this date for a long, long time.}
<A>__{with that, she sets the drinks down on the table and moves in to kiss him a long, slow, wet kiss. but bruce seems strangely unresponsive. she breaks free and gives him a funny look.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{how much is it going to cost me?}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{...to get the ravens back.}
<A>__{he watches her closely for a reaction. selina's shocked, but she conceals it well chuckling in apparent confusion.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{you're the oddest man i've ever met.}
<P>__{(moving in on him)}
<D>__{let's talk later, bruce. i've got kind of a short fuse...}
<A>__{bruce tenses slightly as she kisses him again leaving a crimson lipstick smear on his cheek. she works her way downward, kissing him around his neck and throat... his hand reaches into his jacket pocket. he withdraws a tiny glassine capsule. but before he can use it he jerks back suddenly pushes her away. his free hand goes to his neck, where a thin trickle of blood is oozing from between two bright red lipstick lips. she's bitten him... now she shushes him reaches over to the tiny wound and massages it gently with one hand.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{did i hurt you? just relax you'll start to enjoy it.}
<A>__{bruce pulls away again. his eyes are strangely glazed. he tries to speak, but his tongue feels thick and swollen.}
<C>__{selina }
<D>__{bruce, you look fainterior it must be the cats.}
<A>__{bruce stands suddenly. it's as if he's mired in a slo mo nightmare. his legs give way beneath him and he topples to the floor, inert. his fingers go slack and the capsule rolls out; he tries to reach into his pocket, but his arm won't seem to work. selina's cat, hecate, strolls across his prostrate form purring and stretching... bruce's pov a worm's eye view selina looms over him with a predatory smile on her face, shifting in and out of focus.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{what di what did you d }
<A>__{she runs a finger across her lips and holds it up bright red.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{i guess i've...gotten under your skin.}
<A>__{back to scene on bruce his hand goes to the bite on his neck and he realizes selina's lipstick is spiked with a fast acting paralytic drug. he writhes helplessly on the carpet, his whole body gradually going slack. the penguin, frick and frack stroll through the doorway and stand over him all laughing...}
