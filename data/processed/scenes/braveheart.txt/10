<L>__{ext scottish hills, near the wallace farm day}
<A>__{it's strangely quiet, until william and his friend hamish campbell, a red headed like his father, race up the hillside and duck in among a grove of trees. breathless, gasping, they press their backs to the tree bark. william peers around a tree, then shrinks back and whispers...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{they're coming!}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{how many?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{three, maybe more!}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{armed?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{they're english soldiers, ain't they?}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{with your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{it's up to us, hamish!}
<A>__{hamish leans forward for a look, but william pulls him back.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{not yet! here he comes, be ready!}
<A>__{they wait; heavy footsteps. then from around the edge of the grove three enormous, ugly hogs appear. the boys hurling rotten eggs. the eggs slap the snouts of the pigs, who scatter as the boys charge, howling. we pull back... as the sun goes down on their play.}
