<L>__{exterior streets series of angles sunrise}
<A>__{the garbage man driving the truck, making stops, throwing in more refuse. the truck continues along. doc and carol their faces covered with perspiration and flies... buried within their enclosure under the moist garbage. a garbage dump morning the truck growls along the rutted pathway surrounded by acres of open trash. areas within the dump reveal the slow, smouldering fires... the truck backs up to a huge crater half filled with refuse the driver revs the engine, pulls the bed lift gear the truck bed rises and tilts forward, as the load of trash tumbles down the face of the crater. doc and carol slide down the mountain of filth, and stumbling forward they climb into a large cardboard box. the driver gets out of the cab, checks to see that the garbage is gone from the truck bed. on his way back to the cab he finds a magazine to his liking near a shredded auto tire. with his newly found prize, the driver re enters the truck and drives away. the box lies at the bottom of the crater amongst the broken bottles, melon rinds, flashlight batteries, tin cans, used tires. doc saws at a corner of the cardboard box with his penknife. the matted paper gives away, allowing them more room within the box.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{okay?}

<C>__{doc }
<D>__{don't scratch it, just rub, you'll get an infection.}
<A>__{carol ignores him, she is in bad shape.}

<D>__{listen to me. it's hard enough.}
<A>__{carol turns back, faces doc. their eyes find one another.}
<C>__{doc }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{look, what you said yesterday... i guess that was right. it isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i don't think we can any more... if we ever get out of here, maybe i should take off...}
<C>__{doc}

<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i always thought jails make people hard. not you. you're just not tough enough to forget about beynon. i chose you, not him.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. we got to go one way or another.}
