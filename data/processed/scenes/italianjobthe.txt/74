<A>__{montage lax night the crew deplane from five different airplanes, different air carriers. they disperse in separate vehicles. see charlie at avis, renting a car. see handsome rob renting a u haul panel truck. see stella on a hotel shuttle bus. see half ear on the underground metro rail, taking the red line. see lyle in a taxi, headed south on figueroa street. he notices a young woman hitchhiking. for a moment, their eyes connect. she is a beautiful waif and the feeling sweeps through lyle: if only... but the taxi passes by. charlie checks into shutters, with its victorian beach house feel and oceanfront view. stella's at the peninsula in beverly hills with its opulent lobby. handsome rob's at the standard, with its kitschy decor and ironic style. he stares at a huge empty aquarium behind the front desk where a performance artist writhes and a dj spins out rhythmic throbs. very l.a. half ear's at the new renaissance hollywood hotel adjacent to the dramatic babylon gate and the kodak theatre. and lyle's at the downtown bonaventure, riding up the glass elevator. perfect gearhead hotel.}
