<A>__{the ayatollah takes the butt end of his flag pole and jabs it into randy's side. randy grimaces in pain. the ayatollah unties the flag from its pole and wraps it around randy's neck. he jerks upward on the flag, lifting randy off the mat by his neck. randy thrashes around, fighting for breath. the ayatollah releases randy from the choke. randy crumples to the ground, gasping for air. the ayatollah picks up randy by his hair and flings him back in the ring.}
