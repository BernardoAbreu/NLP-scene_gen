<L>__{exterior. stuyvesant town housing project day.}
<A>__{under the credits, the camera pans slowly across the project, capturing the sober monotony, the endless straight apartment houses. seven o'clock in the morning.}

<L>__{interior. charlie's bedroom}
<A>__{the bedroom of a two and a half room apartment in the housing project. it is early morning, but the shades are drawn and the room is dark. camera moves slowly across the room, over the large double bed on which charlie and helen samson, a young couple in their late twenties, are sleeping. they are sleeping more or less on their sides, facing away from each other. one of helen's pajama clad legs projects from under the light covers. we close in on charlie's sleeping face. the alarm clock at a distant end of the room suddenly bursts into a soft relentless buzz. charlie's eyes open. there is a muffled movement at his side, and helen gets up on one elbow. then she sits up, rises, and pads barefooted a rather pretty girl in rumpled pajamas to the alarm clock and turns it off. charlie's head turns on the pillow so that he can watch her. she pads back to the bed now and stands at the foot, looking down at her husband. she produces a smile, then turns and shuffles into the bathroom where she turns on the wall switch. a shaft of light now pours into the bedroom. charlie sits up in bed. his shoes and socks are on the floor by his feet. he reaches down and starts to put them on. suddenly, from the recesses of the bathroom, helen's rather vague soprano lifts into the first lines of a popular song. then it stops as abruptly as it began. charlie's head slowly turns to look at the bathroom, back again to the business of putting on his socks. his face is expressionless, but there is no mistaking the sodden distaste he has for the world today. he just sits on the bed, a young man of twenty nine, clad only in his pajama trousers, one sock dangling from his hand, his head hanging, his shoulders slumped. behind him, the sudden noise of rushing tap water, then off. then his wife comes back into the bedroom. she is carrying a bath towel with which she is drying her face. finished, she drops the towel on the bed and begins to dress. a moment later, she pads around the corner of the bed to charlie's front. she is still barefooted and wears her pajama top, but she has exchanged the trousers for a half slip. charlie hasn't moved a muscle since the effort required to lift one sock from the floor.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you think it's too early to call my mother?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{charlie shrugs without looking up. helen goes out of the bedroom, into the little square of foyer where there is a telephone table with a telephone on it. she dials, waits. in the bedroom, charlie rubs his eyes with two fingers.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{hello, ma, did i wake you up? this is helen.... well, i will be going to work, and i wanted to get ahold of you before i left. i called you last night. where were you and pop anyway? i kept calling you every half hour up till one o'clock.... oh, yeah? did you have a nice time? ...}
<B>__{camera slowly moves in for closeup}
<A>__{of charlie in bedroom.}
<C>__{helen's voice}
<D>__{well, listen, ma, i got something to tell you. i'm pregnant.... yeah, pregnant.... of course i'm sure. i've got the report back from the laboratory.... no, you wouldn't know him, doctor axelrod.... second month. he says i can expect the baby in february.... well, grandma, act a little excited, will you? ... you bet i'm excited....}
<B>__{closeup of charlie}
<A>__{he is not excited. if anything he is miserable. his bowed head rises slowly. the eyes open. he stares abstractedly ahead for a moment. then he sighs a profound sigh of resignation. then his eyes close again, and his head slowly sinks back to its previous abjection.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior. the kitchen half hour later}
<A>__{helen, dressed in skirt and blouse now, is preparing two cups of instant coffee, pouring hot water from the saucepan into the two cups. the toaster is ticking. a packaged loaf of white bread is open on the cupboard shelf. finished with pouring the water, helen sets the saucepan back on the stove and comes out into the dining area. the dinette table is covered from end to end by open textbooks, several very large accounting worksheets on which are scrawled meticulous numbers, a ruler, several pencils and a pen, an ash tray glutted with cigarettes, a cup and saucer.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(calling to the bedroom)}
<D>__{do you need any of this or can i take them off the table?}
<A>__{charlie appears in the bedroom doorway, dressed and washed now, a neat, clean young man in a white shirt and neatly knotted tie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i will clean that up in a minute.}
<A>__{he disappears back into the bedroom. helen picks up the ash tray and the cup and saucer.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{how late were you up last night?}
<C>__{charlie's voice}
<D>__{about two.}
<L>__{interior. the bedroom}
<A>__{charlie standing by the window, is picking up his keys, a few dollar bills, a comb, etc., from a chair and putting them into his trouser pockets. the blinds of the bedroom window have been opened, and the high august sun streams in, whitening charlie's face. after he has pocketed his odds and ends, he moves to the chest of drawers on which, among all sorts of other things, there are several textbooks and an opened notebook. he stands a moment looking down into the open notebook, his lips moving ever so little, as he commits some of his notes to memory. he turns a page of the notebook back to check something and then goes back to the previous page. now he opens one of the smaller drawers in the chest of drawers. the drawer contains wisps of his wife's stockings and other feminine things. he finds a small roll of bills and takes one of them, putting the bill in his pocket and closing the dresser drawer.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm taking five bucks from your drawer.}
<A>__{he pauses now to affix a less frowning expression onto his face and goes out into the little foyer and into the dining area.}
<L>__{interior. the dining area}
<A>__{helen is seated at the dinette table, sipping coffee and reading yesterday's newspaper. there are two cups of coffee on the table.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{a guy in my office is getting married, and i got clipped four bucks for his wedding present.}
<A>__{he begins assembling the mass of papers and textbooks on the table.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{who's getting married?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{arnold. i told you about him. the guy with the sick mother.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{oh, yeah.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(trying to decide}
<D>__{whether he needs a}
<P>__{certain worksheet)}
<D>__{the rest of the guys are giving him a bachelor party tonight.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{do you want to go, charlie?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i got class tonight.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what have you got cost accounting?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i think you ought to take off a night. you ought to go, have a little fun for yourself. i think you need that. you go to work all day, you go to school all night. you can miss one night, charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no, these bachelor parties get kind of wild sometimes. the whole philosophy is: it's the groom's last night of freedom. so it gets kind of wild sometimes.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{that's a good philosophy to start a marriage with.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well, a bunch of guys get together, they like to tear up the town a little.}
<A>__{he has assembled his notes and notebooks and texts in a pile on the table, ready to take with him. he sits down and begins sipping his coffee. helen looks back to her newspaper, frowning a little, then looks up at charlie again.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i think you oughta go, charlie. i know you're upset about the baby.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm not upset about the baby.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{come on, charlie. i know how you feel. listen, you don't have to pretend you're excited about the baby. we weren't exactly planning on a baby right now ...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm not upset about the baby.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{it's a shock. i had some bad days before i told you. i said: "oh, boy, that's all we need. a baby." then i said to myself: "if i'm having a baby, i'm having a baby. that's all there is to it." and i like the idea. we're going to have a family, charlie. i like the idea.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well, give me a couple of days to get used to the idea. i will be all right.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i know you will, charlie. that's why i think you ought to go to this bachelor party tonight.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(bursting out)}
<D>__{i don't want to go to this bachelor party.}
<A>__{he looks down at his coffee, embarrassed at the outburst.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm sorry i yelled.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{don't be silly.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i better get going. kenny's probably waiting for me now. i'm sorry i yelled like that.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what are you sorry about? don't i yell at you all the time?}
<A>__{we stay on helen, as she reads her newspaper, but there is a faint frown on her face.}

<A>__{an express train hurtles southward. we see it flashing by through the concrete pillars of the subway.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<B>__{irt express hurtling southward}
<A>__{charlie and another young man, named kenneth, are seated in a crowded subway car. people are standing tightly in the aisles. kenneth is an amiable young man of thirty odd. he has his jacket off and his tie loosened as a concession to the august heat. charlie is neatly and coolly dressed. he has two notebooks and a battered text in his lap. he is reading the texterior two young white collar workers on their way to work. they ride along silently for a moment. kenneth is rather stealthily concerned with a full busted young woman who is standing directly in front of him, holding on to a strap. it is summertime, and the girls all wear light summer frocks. there is a feeling of wistful sensuality to the scene.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{you going to arnold's bachelor party?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't think so, kennie.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i got two classes tonight.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{yeah, i was going to go, but i think i better not, because my kid, the young one, the girl, she's been acting up again lately. she's got some kind of allergy, the doctors don't know what.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{these bachelor parties get kind of wild sometimes. eddie watkins is making all the arrangements. he's probably got us lined up with a bunch of chorus girls.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{yeah, do you think so?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you know eddie.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{yeah, boy, he really lives it up, don't he? did you see that blonde who picked him up for lunch last week? boy, sometimes i wish i was a bachelor. well, you know what i mean. i never seem to get out of the house any more, you know what i mean? about once a week, i go to the movies. we never even see the whole picture. my wife starts worrying about the kids. my youngest kid, the girl, she's got some kind of rash. we don't know what it is. i never seem to see anybody any more. do you know how long it is since i've seen willie duff? i haven't seen willie in about six months. my wife can't stand his wife. you ever seen her, willie's wife?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no, i didn't know willie too well.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{boy, wait'll you have kids, boy. you'll never get out of the house.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{helen's pregnant now.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{no kidding.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{oh, that's wonderful, charlie, that's wonderful!}
<A>__{the two young husbands look down again at their hands and ride along silently. kenneth sneaks a quick look up at the girl standing in front of him, and then lets his attention drift down the length of the car.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{hey, there's a guy down there, trying to pick up a girl down there.}
<A>__{he is referring to a young fellow who elbowed his way down through the crowded aisle but who stopped abruptly when he noticed an attractive girl, seated about three seats down from kenneth. the girl is reading a newspaper. the young fellow stares at her. the girl, aware of this sudden attention, looks briefly up from her newspaper. the young fellow smiles pleasantly. the girl, with a show of annoyance, looks back to her newspaper.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{were you with us about eight years ago when i picked up that chick in front of the bus stop in paterson, new jersey?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{when was this?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{yeah, you were there. you were with that girl from brooklyn. we just came from palisades amusement park, and we were driving frankie klein's girl home, and the car broke down right in the middle of route one.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(beginning to laugh)}
<D>__{oh, yeah.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{and frankie opened up the hood and the water cap blew right up in the air.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{and the cop came over ...}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{that's right, the cop. he thought frankie shot off a gun....}
<A>__{they are both laughing audibly now at the memory.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{he was going to pull us all in. oh, man!}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{frankie, he was funny.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{oh, that was a lot of fun, those days.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah, they were.}
<A>__{the little spasm of laughter is over. a sort of ruefulness settles down on the two young husbands. kenneth looks lazily down the aisle to see how the young fellow is making out with the girl. he seems to be making out all right. they are looking steadily at each other now. kenneth turns back to charlie.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{hey, this guy's making out all right. she's giving him the eye now.}
<A>__{charlie leans forward to see this progress.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<P>__{(looking out the}
<D>__{window at the passing}
<P>__{local station)}
<D>__{where are we now, prince street? i bet you he picks her up before we hit chambers street.}
<A>__{somehow this has a sobering effect on the two young husbands. again they sit silently as the train buckets along.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{boy, i'm bushed today. i was up till two o'clock last night on this thing here. i'm getting to be a nervous wreck. i snarled at helen this morning. i think this whole night school business is getting me down.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{i don't see how you do it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{neither do i. i thought i was through with it. the plan was for me to quit work and go to college full time and cram through in a year or so. but now we got this kid coming, and helen's going to have to quit her job, and that sets me back where i started from. another five years of this, summers included.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{i couldn't do it, man, i will tell you that. i wish i could, but i couldn't.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{oh, what am i griping about? this is the life i picked out for myself. but it's a grind, boy, i tell you.}
<A>__{they sit silently again. the train hurtles along and then suddenly slows as it approaches a stop. there is a rustle of movement among the passengers in the subway car. a few people start edging toward the doors. the girl reading the newspaper now folds her newspaper and stands almost directly in the young fellow's face. they regard each other.}
<C>__{young fellow}
<P>__{(to the girl)}
<D>__{excuse me, can you tell me how to get to the nassau street exit?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{well ... well, at the top of the stairs, you'll see all the signs.}
<C>__{young fellow}
<D>__{are you getting off here?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{young fellow}
<D>__{well, i will follow you then. that'll be easier, if you don't mind.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{no, not at all.}
<A>__{they start to crowd down the aisle. the train is chugging into the chambers street station, and we can see the yellowed lights of the platform and the quick blur of faces. the two young husbands, who had been following the byplay between the girl and the young fellow, now watch them slowly exit. there is an expression of poignant wistfulness on both their faces.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior. the office}
<A>__{we look down on the bookkeeping department of a life insurance company in downtown manhattan area around pine street. it is a fairly large room, large enough to hold eleven desks. but you get the feeling that this is one of the smaller offices on the floor. you get the feeling that this company occupies three or four floors of this building. despite the size of the office, it has a cluttered look. each desk has piles of paper on it, and all the impedimenta of the bookkeeper the pens and pencils, the adding machine, the telephone. some of the desks have typewriters. along the walls there are rows of filing cabinets and wall bins stocked with large worksheets and thick ledgers. at the far end of the room, there is a row of windows, but it is still necessary to keep the overhead fluorescent lights on all day. they are on now. there are two middle aged women standing, murmuring to each other, and a rather heavy set balding man in his late forties, sitting at a desk in his shirt sleeves, already hard at work, although it is still ten minutes shy of eight thirty. kenneth and charlie enter. ad lib hellos between them and the two middle aged women. charlie moves to the coat rack to hang up his jacket, drops off his books on his desk, starts for the coat rack. behind charlie, we see kenneth, carrying his jacket, moving to his desk, up where the middle aged man is working.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{hiya, walter.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hiya, walter.}
<A>__{walter, the middle aged man, nods his good mornings.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<P>__{(poking in his desk drawer; amiably)}
<D>__{walter, what time do you come in in the mornings? you're making us all look lousy, you know that? i get the feeling sometimes, you stay here overnight.}
<A>__{walter merely nods, doesn't bother to look up from the work. kenneth finds a stick of gum in his drawer, unwraps it. two more women, gray haired and bespectacled, come into the office. there is an ad lib mumble of hellos in background. charlie hangs up his jacket on the coat rack.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{arnold in yet?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{he starts his vacation today. he's getting married sunday, you know.}
<A>__{closeup of charlie looking out the window into the bright august morning. his face is just a little ruffled by a frown, and there is a kind of pain in his eyes. behind him, walter and kenneth.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(a nervous, anxious man)}
<D>__{well, the doctor was over last night. brought over the x rays; brought over the allergy tests. brought over a bill for sixty eight dollars. i said to him: "doctor, you're a young man, professional, highly educated, four years of college, two years of premedical training, several years of interning, of residency. if you're so smart, how can you charge me sixty eight dollars? one thing they apparently didn't teach you in medical school. you can't get blood from a stone."}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{so what's wrong with you, walter?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{what's wrong? i have to go to arizona, that's what's wrong. i have asthma. when i was a kid, they called it hay fever, and you carried a bag around your neck. asafetida. now, they call it asthma, and you have to go to arizona. i said to him: "doctor, you're a professional man, four years of college, premedical school, bellevue, several diplomas. answer me a question. who's going to pay for arizona?" i said to him: "doctor," i said, "perhaps you have the illusion i am the aga khan. i have a bearing about me, perhaps, that misleads you to believe i have blood ties with the whitneys and the rockefellers. this isn't true." arizona. did you ever hear of such nonsense?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{how serious is it, walter?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{serious. nothing serious. i have hay fever, i sneeze a couple of times. the idiot told my wife i have to go to arizona, and she wouldn't leave me alone all night. she's already packing the bags. i said: "for heaven's sakes, you listen to doctors, we'll all be dead." my son, harold, believe me, he's going to be a doctor. that's some racket, boy. sixty eight dollars.}
<A>__{closeup of charlie, still at the window, when a bell suddenly clangs, indicating the start of the workday. the sudden jangle makes him start, and he closes his eyes briefly against the noise. walter, in background, who had risen and was bent over kenneth's desk, darts nervously back to his own desk.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you better get to work. hey, charlie, that was the bell. i think flaherty is here this morning. we'll all be fired today. i have a feeling.}
<A>__{he hunches over his ledgers again, his anxious, harried face drawn into intense wrinkles of concentration. several other women have come into the office by now, and there is a general movement to the desks. there is the click of a typewriter, and walter runs his fingers glibly over the adding machine on his desk. the day has started. after a moment, charlie turns from the window and comes back to his desk, sinks down onto his chair.}

<L>__{interior. the office twenty minutes later}
<A>__{we look down on the bookkeeping department. all the desks are occupied but two. there are six women and our three men. the office is silent with industry, everybody's head bent over his desk. there is the occasional punctuation of an adding machine or a typewriter or a phone ringing. our three men are bent over their tally sheets, worksheets, and ledgers, occasionally reaching up to quickly tabulate something on the adding machine. after a moment, walter says:}

<P>__{(without looking up from his work)}
<D>__{you fellows going to arnold's party tonight?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<P>__{(without looking up)}

<D>__{yeah, charlie says eddie has a whole bunch of chorus girls lined up for us tonight.}
<A>__{walter's head comes up for the first time.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{no kidding.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i didn't say that. i just said that if i knew eddie, we'd probably wind up with some of his crazy girl friends.}

<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{yeah. he told me she was a television actress. i think i saw her once on "studio one." she was in a coal mine with some stir crazy coalminer who was trying to strangle her with a necktie.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i'd like to strangle her with a necktie.}

<A>__{walter looks up suddenly from his work, a strange sting of pain crossing his face.}
<C>__{walter}

<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{yeah, he really banged it up i hear.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you ought to see the old heap i've got. he walks out of here on payday, he can spend the whole works on having himself a good time. i walk out of here, and i got three kids and a wife, all of them with their palms out. i lost two bucks playing poker at my house last week. it was an economic catastrophe. my wife didn't sleep all night.}

<D>__{he'll be twenty minutes late again. if flaherty walked in now, he'd fire him. if that ever happened to me, i think i'd kill myself. what does eddie care? so he scrambles around for another job. flaherty told me last week i had too many days off. i told him i was sick in bed. what do you want me to do?}
<A>__{he turns back again to his work, his face creased with anxiety. the three men work silently for a moment. then the office door opens, and a man of about thirty five, a little stout, but rather casual in his dress, wearing steel rimmed glasses, enters. this is eddie watkins, the office bachelor. he seems to have had very little sleep the night before. his eyes, behind the wire rimmed glasses, are heavy lidded. a cigarette dangles listlessly, from his mouth. there is something of the bacchanalian libertine about eddie. there is a perfunctory exchange of hellos and good mornings, establishing that this is eddie. he shuffles with ineffable weariness to his desk.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{hi, eddie, you're early today, only twenty minutes late, what happened?}

<D>__{no.}

<A>__{eddie is scowling over a home style movie projector, muttering over the intricacies of fitting a reel into the ratchets. arnold has suddenly become voluble and is gabbing away at him. camera dollies around them during the scene so that we can see into the living room of the apartment, appointed in simple but neat masculine taste, where the other three men move in and out of view. right now, we are concerned only with arnold and eddie.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{... we're moving in with her mother and father. i don't know if that's such a good idea. what do you think? we haven't got an apartment yet, and we figure we'll live a year with her folks, save on the rent, see?}

<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{oh, sure.}
<A>__{arnold moves a step, still in the shaft of light, his shadow huge on the wall. eddie, muttering, jockeys the projector around trying to focus it on the screen. the square of light and some flickering images wander up and down a wall.}

<D>__{... we're sitting in the car, so she says: "well, arnold, we've been going together six months now. i think it's time we decided whether we were being serious."}

<D>__{hey, eddie, you got it on the window.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i didn't know it was so serious. i didn't even know we were going together. i just took her out every now and then.}

<C>__{walter}
<D>__{does anybody seriously want to see these movies?}

<D>__{arnold, you're in the way again. come on now. all right, put off the lights.}
<A>__{the room is flooded in darkness again. walter hurries to a chair. the square of light is reasonably focused, just an edge trailing off onto the drapes of the window. numbers flicker quickly on on the screen. the rest of the scene we see looking into the whitened faces of the five men at their various posts. arnold crosses, stands back of walter.}

<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah, it does look like arnold.}

<D>__{that fellow there is not a bad actor.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{actor. you could play that part pretty easy yourself.}
<C>__{kenneth}

<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i'd like to see this in three d.}
<A>__{the side comments drift off for a moment, and a sort of frozen attention settles on the white faces. each face is sort of set in a mold of determined disinterest, but the eyes are all watching.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{well, i will just watch one of them. then, i think i will just go home.}

<P>__{(she sits)}
<D>__{when i had my first baby, mike was ashamed to be seen on the streets with me. well, listen, he was interning at the time. we needed a baby like a hole in the head. that's why he's a general practitioner now, because of that baby. he was studying to be a surgeon. he absolutely refused to admit i was pregnant. even in my ninth month, and i was as big as a house. he used to walk ten paces in front of me in the street like he didn't know who that woman with the belly was. where is charlie anyway?}

<C>__{julie}
<D>__{are you kidding? what do you think these bachelor parties are for, bachelors? this is for the married men. it's a good excuse to get drunk and find some girls.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{can you picture charlie getting drunk and picking up a girl? charlie's old sobersides. you should have seen what i went through to get him to make a pass at me. he's so sweet. nobody knows how really sweet he is, he's so quiet all the time. my brother died in september, he used to stay up with me till three, four o'clock every night. i used to cry all night, and he used to sit on the bed and talk with me. i used to look at him talking there, and i used to think: "what would i do without this sweet man here? i'd go crazy." you know, you like to be a little cynical sometimes, julie.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{wait'll you've been married eleven years.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you like to talk about all the affairs everybody's husband is having. do you know actually one woman whose husband is actually playing around?}

<C>__{julie}
<D>__{wait'll you've been married eleven years.}

<P>__{(looking down)}
<D>__{wait'll charlie gets to be forty two. my mike's having an affair right now with one of his patients right now. we don't talk about it don't you, either, not even to charlie. but mike knows i know about it. i even know the patient. a married woman with a hyperthyroid problem. my mike's a good doctor with a pretty good practice. the kids are crazy about him. but every now and then he has to go out and get involved with a woman.}
<A>__{she looks down at her hands in her lap.}
<C>__{julie}

<A>__{she puts the box of tea bags an the workshelf, unhooks a saucepan hanging over the stove, turns to the sink and fills it with water. helen regards her, not quite knowing what to say. julie sets the saucepan going on the stove, stares at it.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i don't know why i told you. don't tell anybody, not even charlie. i don't want the family to know. but this woman isn't the first one. i know that much. about three years ago, the doorbell rings. i open the door. there's a man there. he says: "tell your husband to stay away from my sister." how would you like to open the door and have somebody say that to you? i cried for two weeks. i don't know what to do about it, helen. should i bring it out in the open with mike or should i just keep my mouth shut like the other time? because he's not going to leave me. even if he doesn't care about me, he has his kids to think about. we married too young. that was our big mistake. we married too young.}

<D>__{a little from the suppressed emotion}
<P>__{within her)}
<D>__{we should have waited till he finished his internship. what kind of married life is that? twenty two dollars a month he was earning. every other day, he had to sleep in the hospital. the first two years of our marriage, we didn't even see each other. and then i'm pregnant. he had to quit, what do you think? he wanted to be a surgeon, he wound up being a g.p. from that day he hated me. i had two other children by him, but he hated me. he told me in just so many words. why do you think i kept telling you, helen, why do you think i kept telling you: "don't have a baby till charlie finds himself."}

<D>__{it hurts! even after eleven years, it hurts!}
<A>__{she stands abruptly and moves quickly past helen out the kitchen doorway into the dark living room, leaving helen standing troubled, concerned, in the kitchen. after a moment, helen moves to the kitchen doorway and a step out into the dining area. she looks through the dark living room to the gray silhouette of julie standing by the living room window, her form lightly outlined by a tracing of moonlight.}

<C>__{walter}
<D>__{is that the last one?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{yeah.}

<D>__{well, i've been married six years. i've got two kids that keep me awake all night long. every sunday, we go out driving in long island looking for a house that's going to take one, probably two mortgages. i better love my wife.}

<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{it's after ten. it's about ten after ten.}
<A>__{kenneth rips off a paper towel. the only noise for a moment is the soft crumpling of paper as kenneth dries his hands.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{the party's getting a little wild in there anyway. eddie and walter got poor arnold nailed in there, they're trying to talk him into getting a girl. this party's going to wind up in a joint, let me tell you. this is a good time to blow.}

<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{quit what?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{quit night school. tonight was the first laughs i've had in years. i can't remember the last time i had so much fun. look what i'm missing. i'm making a pretty good living. i can support a wife and baby on what i make. i'm going to quit! i mean it. i'm going to quit. boy, what a time to have a baby.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{you don't have to quit school because you're having a baby, charlie. there are lots of guys go to night school with two, three kids.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you ought to meet some of these guys. they're just grinding their lives away. it's an obsession with some of these guys. i mean, what's the point? so i will go five more years to night school. so i will get my degree. so i will get a job as a junior accountant for three years at seventy five bucks a week. i'm making better than that now. and then it just starts. the cpa exams. by the time i'm fifty, i can start living. at this point, i get a heart attack and an ulcer, and they bury me in the ground, and they say: "that was charlie samson, the man who didn't see a movie in fifty years." why go through all that? i will quit. i feel so mad right now, you better keep an eye on me, kennie, because i'm going to wind up punching somebody.}

<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{charlie, go home. i can see you're going to get fried tonight and wind up picking up a tramp and you're going to wake up in the morning feeling like two bits.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it'd be a profit.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{charlie, about five years ago, i went without a job for seven months. alice was carrying our first baby. we were living on money i borrowed from my brother. i don't know if you remember me in those days, but it was rough. i used to go out every night, put a load on, and make a pass at any girl who looked at me. and i mean any. big, tall, short, fat, anything. well, one night i picked up some tomato somewheres, and we were sitting in a bar or somewheres, and i kept calling her alice all night. so she says to me: "my name ain't alice. who's alice?" so i said: "alice is my wife," and i got up and i went home.}
<A>__{charlie waits a moment for kenneth to continue, but apparently this is all kenneth has to offer at the moment.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{i don't know. i had a point when i started telling that story.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm not looking for another woman.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{yes, you are, charlie. you may not know it, but you are. so go on home, charlie, before you get any drunker than you are. charlie, you start messing with other women, something goes. it'll kill your marriage. it'll kill your wife. it'll just kill her. what my wife went through well, i don't even want to remember it. it's never the same with your wife again, charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm not looking for any woman.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{i think what i was trying to say was you stick with your night school. some guys have to make peace with themselves that they're never going to amount to too much. a guy like me. once i made that peace with myself, i found out it doesn't really matter what you amount to. i got a nice wife and two children i complain about all the time, but if anything ever happened to either one of them, i think i'd die. but you don't have to make that kind of peace, and you'd be crazy to settle for less than what you want. you want something, charlie. i think that's wonderful.}
<P>__{(charlie's eyes go toward kenneth)}
<D>__{you're a little drunk now, and you're fed up to the teeth. everybody gets fed up, charlie. you stick with it. you're going to be all right.}

<L>__{interior. greenwich village duplex apartment}
<A>__{this is one of those duplex apartments on west tenth street which consists of one huge living room that is two stories high and you need a little rolling stepladder to reach the books on the upper shelves of the built in bookcases. there is a little wrought iron stairway that leads to the second floor, which consists of two tiny little bedrooms. apartments like these, as is the case in this one, are usually lived in by two girls, one of whom is a secretary in an advertising agency and the other a model for a garment manufacturing firm. both girls are in their early thirties and are milling about somewhere in the mass of people in the living room, carrying drinks, laughing up a storm, pausing at the little knots of discussion groups with an apt phrase. they rather think of themselves as madame de staels with their own salon of bright young people, for most of the men and women at the party are in some way connected with the arts, probably in an avant garde way. it is a little difficult to tell this by looking at them because avant garde artists have become obsessed with dressing like businessmen, but if you can hear the talk as we can, you get the point fast enough. we pick up phrases like: "i really find it difficult to think of tennessee williams as a serious artist," or "my teacher thinks all tenors are frogs except gigli," or "i don't see how you can say that; his designs fairly throb with sex." there are, as eddie predicted, a number of people sitting on the floor, mostly girls, circled in the swirl of their ann fogarty dresses, and there is one obvious ballerina, with her black hair pulled tightly back into a severe pony tail, using the wrought iron railing that separates the dropped living room from the small entrance foyer to demonstrate something about positions at the dancing bar. there is someone at the piano banging away, shouting his songs, but he is completely inaudible five feet away. a few people lean over the piano, apparently exhilarated by the songs. thin blankets of smoke wreathe their way up to the two story high ceiling. we catch some more phrases: "i thought truman capote was supposed to be here." "truman's in russia, i think." "good heavens, what can the russians want with truman capote?" "oh, i never read anything published in this country." "oh, i mean, the paper bound paris edition." in short, this is a real chi chi wingding where all the furniture is too low, and the hostess is very proud of the fact that her end table is made out of an orange crate. somewhere, through the jumble of the party, we can hear the doorbell chime. a young woman, at one of the little knots of people, perks her ears and says:}
<C>__{hostess}
<D>__{i'm sure that's the police again.}
<A>__{she's very proud of this. she turns and weaves her way through the crowded room, carrying her drink. she goes up the step to the entrance foyer, turns to her left, picks her way over two middle aged men who are both throwing a pitch at a fairly tight girl of eighteen, past the kitchen, which is a bedlam of ice cubes and kitchen towels and which is occupied at the moment by two intense women in their late thirties wrapped in deep discussion, up past two young men who have no immediate use for girls, to the front door of the apartment. she opens the door. group shot of eddie, arnold, and charlie from the hostess's point of view. not exactly a heartening sight to most hostesses, three fairly loaded young men with their collars unbuttoned and their ties limp and dangling.}

"tu mettrais." you know that one. well, he kept screaming about the rent i didn't like him, you know and i called this boy named george who used to live in poughkeepsie when i was going to vassar, and he's crazy about me. he lives in st. luke's place now, but he goes to poughkeepsie every wednesday to see his mother, he's got an oedipus, so that was out. well, my new landlord kept telling me how much he was in love with me. i said: "how existentialist can you get? you just met me five minutes ago." he was absolutely crazy about me.}

<D>__{arnold, i want my wife so much right now. i want her to be happy. i want to just go home and hold her and tell her how much she means to me. i mean, even walter, he's going to die, but don't you think he'll be in tomorrow morning, same old walter, jokes and laughs? he's got somebody to live for. he's even got somebody to die for. i mean, how rich can a man be? and poor eddie i used to be so jealous of him. i used to think he was so free. free from what? from loving a woman, from really wanting a woman. arnold, what i'm trying to tell you is life is nothing if you don't love somebody but life is wonderful if you do love somebody. arnold, i want my wife so much right now ...}
<A>__{arnold is a little embarrassed by his friend's display of emotion and, frankly, hasn't understood a word charlie was talking about.}

<A>__{but he is talking to an empty staircase. charlie has plunged down into the darkness of the floor below. arnold turns and sighs and shuffles back to the door of his apartment. he rings the bell lightly, takes a deep breath. a moment, and the door opens. a girl of about thirty five, bespectacled, rather plain, with a sensitive face, stands in the doorway. arnold stands, his head down in shame.}

<D>__{hello, louise. i'm very sorry, honest.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{sure, arnold, i know.}
<A>__{she looks anxiously over arnold's shoulder to see if anyone else is there. arnold lumbers past her into the apartment. voices, both male and female, pop out at him. "what's the matter with you, are you crazy?" "what's the matter with you?" "for heaven's sakes, where have you been?" ... the door closes.}

<A>__{long shot looking down the wide courtyard of stuyvesant town, its endless little pathways winding from the various apartment house doors to the central pathway which leads to a stairway to the street. it is half past five in the morning. the sky is gray and desolate. the courtyard and any other street we see is absolutely empty. the camera pans over this empty expanse to the stairway where charlie appears now, coming quickly up the steps. he moves down the central sidewalk, a little faster than he would usually walk; you have the feeling he is exerting an effort to keep from running. camera pans with him as he hurries to one of the winding side lanes leading to a particular apartment house.}
