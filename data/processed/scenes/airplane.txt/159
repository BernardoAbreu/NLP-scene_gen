<L>__{interior car night}
<A>__{kramer and a mutilated carey are en route to airport. kramer is at the wheel. through rear window is obvious rear projection of passing road.}
<C>__{kramer}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{no, we can't do that; the risk of a flameout is too great. keep him 24,000. no, feet!}
<A>__{he hangs up phone.}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{one of the passengers is going to land that plane.}
<C>__{carey}
<D>__{is that possible?}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{possible, but it's a hundred to one shot. thousand to one. i know this guy.}
<C>__{carey}
<D>__{you do? who is it?}
<A>__{we hear a thunk. rear projection shows he has run oyer a bicyclist, who stands and gives the finger.}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{his name is ted striker. i flew with him during the war. and that won't make my job any easier tonight.}
<A>__{rear projection speeds up to obvious fast motion.}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{ted striker was a crack flight leader up to a pointerior but he was one of those men who, well, let's just say he felt too much inside. maybe you know the kind.}
<A>__{now rear projection indicates car is turning and then weaving, but kramer does not move wheel.}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{it takes a certain type to perform under pressure. striker didn't have it.}
<A>__{by now rear projection is cowboys and indians on horseback chasing and shooting at kramer's car.}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{ate his heart out over every name on the casualty lists. the upshot of it is that he went all to pieces on one particular mission. let's just hope it doesn't happen again tonight.}
