<L>__{interior helicopter same time}
<A>__{distraction, just enough: the pilot banks toward the car.}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{where are you going??}
<A>__{timothy grabs the stick that's when charly breaks cover. does a mad stagger across the blacktop. goes for the gun. timothy changes direction. chopper again, screaming in low and fast charly dives, rolls comes up with the machine gun and falls flat on her back, points it skyward:}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{suck on it.}
<A>__{she fires. blows the chopper's tail rotor. the craft pitches to the side dumps timothy out the door. flailing. head over heels, he falls lands atop the tanker, right on the silver tank and burns. actually sizzles at 310 degrees celsius, steam pouring off him like a vampire in daylight, shrieking !}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{die screaming, motherfucker.}
<A>__{she watches as he slips from sight... off the tanker. sirens now, approaching. wind, biting cold. ground black and bloody in the moonlight... here comes henessey, powers across the lot, pedal to the metal. followed at a distance of fifty yards by half a dozen squawling government vehicles, flashers turning. henessey stomps the brake. slews to a stop, tires cooking...! kicks open the passenger door as charly collapses into the car, caitlin in her arms. the kid says:}
<C>__{caitlin}
<D>__{hurry! the truck is a bomb!}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{yeah, yeah. what else, we got a fucking lightning rod on the roof...? no, caitlin, don't check.}
<A>__{he peels out.}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{hey... you're bleeding...}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{i think that's yours...}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{right, sorry...}
<A>__{he inadvertently smacks a light pole. sparks fly.}
<C>__{caitlin}
<D>__{you're a bad driver! who said you could drive?}
