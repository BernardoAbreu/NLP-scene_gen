<D>__{zachetti. that's funny. phyllis and zachetti. what was he doing up at her house? i couldn't figure that one out i tried to make sense out of it and got nowhere. but the real brain twister came the next day. you sprang it on me, keyes, after office hours, when you caught me down in the lobby of the building.}
<A>__{about 5:00 p.m. or a little later. a stream of office employees is coming out of an elevator; a second elevator reaches the lobby and some more office employees come out, among them neff, wearing his hat and carrying his briefcase. camera precedes him as he walks toward the entrance doors. he is stopped by keyes' voice, off to one side.}
<C>__{keyes' voice}
<D>__{oh, walter, just a minute.}
<A>__{neff stops and looks towards the cigar counter, as he moves towards him. keyes is standing there buying cigars. he is stuffing them into his pockets.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{hello, keyes.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{hang onto your hat, walter.}
<C>__{neff}

<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{margie. i still bet she drinks from the bottle.}
<A>__{he bites off the end of the cigar and puts the cigar into his mouth. he starts tapping his pockets for a match, as usual. neff strikes a match for him.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{they give you matches when they sell you cigars, keyes. all you have to do is ask for them.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{i don't like them. they always explode in my pockets. so long, walter.}
<A>__{keyes goes toward the street and out of scene. neff moves back into the lobby, camera following him. as he reaches the elevator, he looks back over his shoulder, to make sure keyes is gone, then steps into the empty elevator.}
<C>__{neff's voice}
<D>__{you sure had me worried, keyes. i didn't know if you were playing cat and mouse with me, whether you knew all along i was the somebody else. that's what i had to find out, and i thought i knew where to look...}
