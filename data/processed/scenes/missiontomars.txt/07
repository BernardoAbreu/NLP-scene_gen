<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior same view. night (hours later)}
<A>__{all the parked cars and vans are gone now, except for two: mcconnell's jeep and woody's classic 'vette. willis, one of the last to go, is just departing on his motorcycle. perched behind him, arms around his waist, is pretty girl #3. they zoom away, through the darkened neighborhood.}
<L>__{exterior back yard. night}
<A>__{the yard is nearly deserted. the "bon voyage" banner has torn loose at one end and flutters limply. here and there a napkin blows across the ground. in the distance, three figures sit on the ground, by the waning fire of the barbecue pit, sipping beers.}
<B>__{closer on this trio}
<A>__{as woody shoves another piece of wood into the flames. for a moment he, mcconnell, and luke are silent, staring at the sparks as they rise towards the stars red and gold dots mingling with the silver ones.}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(abruptly)}
<D>__{i wish we were all going. together.}
<A>__{the intensity in his voice surprises the others, and even woody himself. luke glances at mcconnell. an awkward beat.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{then you've got a short memory. think back to how we were by the second week of lunar training.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{oh, you're not gonna bring that up again }
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{i'm trying to remember, let's see, which one of us scored the lowest ranking up there?}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{you just can't let that go }
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh, man, three commanders, on the same ship? if they sent us off to mars together, there wouldn't be enough fuel to lift all those egos.}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{bullshit, we would've made a great crew.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{that was never gonna happen. i was always teamed with maggie, and we were mostly chalkboard jockies. you know? systems. payloads...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{listen to him. mr. cover of time magazine!}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{yeah, who landed the crippled block ii shuttle?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yeah, and who scored highest on the lunar rankings?}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{let it go, luke.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{sure, i made a little noise. but putting the first footprints on mars? nah. that's for guys who...}
<P>__{(looks at luke)}
<D>__{...wrote their ph.d. thesis on how to colonize the place. and guys who...}
<P>__{(looks at woody)}
<D>__{...read too much science fiction as a kid and still wear little flash gordon rocketships around their necks.}
<A>__{he grabs playfully at woody's neck. woody smacks his hand away, laughing.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{you read the same damn science fiction books that i did! you're just not man enough to wear jewelry!}
<A>__{he pulls from his shirt a little flash gordon rocketship emblem hanging on a chain, and waggles this tauntingly at mcconnell, as luke and mcconnell laugh.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{you want flash. you know you want him. well you'll have to come through me!}
<A>__{luke grabs woody's arm to give mcconnell a better shot at the emblem, but woody cuffs his hands away, laughing. mcconnell, watching their horseplay, shakes his head.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{god, she would've loved to see you two clowns. just one more time.}
<A>__{he tries to smile, but his face reddens. then all at once his chest is heaving as he struggles to control his emotions. woody sees this, reaches out a reassuring hand, but mcconnell shakes him off, rises abruptly. he turns his back on them, walking away a few steps. woody and luke exchange a worried glance.}
