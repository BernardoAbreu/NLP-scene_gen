<A>__{a shot of willcox hillyer at a counter getting his ticket processed. a little smile is on his face as he talks to a pretty airline girl. this character likes girls; his aloofness is modified, his face changes when he talks to them. the airline girl smiles back, she finds him attractive. we don't hear what they are saying, no dialogue on track it is obvious he is flirting with the girl in a mild way, but now a frown comes on his face and he turns his head as if slightly annoyed by something.}
