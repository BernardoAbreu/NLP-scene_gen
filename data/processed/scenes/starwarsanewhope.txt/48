<L>__{exterior tatooine wasteland}
<A>__{the speeder stops before what remains of the huge jawas sandcrawler. luke and ben walk among the smoldering rubble and scattered bodies.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it looks like sandpeople did this, all right. look, here are gaffi sticks, bantha tracks. it's just... i never heard of them hitting anything this big before.}
<A>__{ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{they didn't. but we are meant to think they did. these tracks are side by side. sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{these are the same jawas that sold us artoo and threepio.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{and these blast points, too accurate for sandpeople. only imperial stormtroopers are so precise.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{why would imperial troops want to slaughter jawas?}
<A>__{luke looks back at the speeder where artoo and threepio are inspecting the dead jawas, and put two and two together.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{if they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. and that would lead them home!}
<A>__{luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for the speeder and jumps it.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{wait, luke! it's too dangerous.}
<A>__{luke races off leaving ben and the two robots alone with the burning sandcrawler.}
