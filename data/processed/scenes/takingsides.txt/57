<L>__{interior straube apartment evening}
<A>__{david and emmi, sitting.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i want you to come back to the office. may i come in? if you are there you can influence what happens. what good can you do by leaving. if you go, you are giving up and how can you help furtwangler or me? don't think about leaving. stay.}
<L>__{interior steve's office day}
<A>__{hot, windows closed. furtwangler seated. david and emmi present. steve looks up from his notes.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the jews. but }
<P>__{(holds up a sheaf of papers.)}
<D>__{i have things here you said and wrote. listen to this: 'the jew composer schonberg is admired by the jewish international.' and what about this: 'jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' you deny you said these things?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{those attitudes do not exist in me.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i believe that. but just answer the question, don't give me explanations.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{speaking to party members i used their language, of course i did, everyone did.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(with some irony)}
<D>__{major, sorry to interrupt, but maybe we have to... maybe we have to balance those things against his assistance to his jewish colleagues.}
<A>__{steve tenses.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{this is a transcript of the proceedings at nuremberg. a swedish businessman, birger dahlerus, testified in cross examination that he had several meetings with hermann goering. 'i first saw goering,' dahlerus testified, 'embroiled in a stormy interview with wilhelm furtwangler, the famous conductor of the berlin philharmonic, who was vainly seeking permission to keep his jewish concert master.}
<A>__{holds up his package of letters and dumps them on emmi's desk.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{emmi, pick one of these, any one, read it out loud.}
<A>__{emmi is uncertain. steve shrugs indifferently. she picks an envelope and takes out the letter.}
<C>__{emmi}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{'please remember that dr. furtwangler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. i personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. he never turned anyone away. after he heard me play... i am a violinist... he gave me money because i was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to sweden. he helped countless people in similar ways.'}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{and this, only one of these letters, major. i have lots of them.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{how many times have i got to tell you i was in insurance? you think i can't smell a phoney policy when it's shoved under my nose? sure, he helped jews, but that was just insurance, his cover, because all the while he was maestro of all he surveyed,}
<P>__{(turning on furtwangler)}
<D>__{see, wilhelm, i think you're their boy, their creature. you were like an advertising slogan for them: this is what we produce, the greatest conductor in the world. and you went along with it. the truth of the matter is, wilhelm, you didn't need to be a member of the party. i made a mistake when i asked you for your party number. i should've asked you for your non party number. just like some other well known artists.}
<P>__{(suddenly, to emmi)}
<D>__{emmi, put that record on.}
<A>__{emmi puts on the record of the adagio from bruckner's seventh symphony. after a moment:}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{do you know what that is?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{of course i know what that is.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{okay, so what is it?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{bruckner's seventh. the adagio.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{who's conducting?}
<C>__{furtwanglbr}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you know the last time it was played on these air waves?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{how can i know such a thing?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i will tell you, then. the last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal hitler had shot himself. listen to it. they listen. did they pick little k's recording? did they pick some other conductor? no, they picked you, and why? because you represented them so beautifully. when the devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. you were everything to them.}
<A>__{the music plays.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<P>__{(near to breakdown}
<D>__{but struggling for}
<P>__{control)}
<D>__{i have always tried to analyse myself carefully and closely. in staying here, i believed i walked a tightrope between exile and the gallows. you seem to be blaming me for not having allowed myself to be hanged.}
<A>__{david takes the record off.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i didn't directly oppose the party because i told myself, that was not my job. if i had taken any active part in politics i could not have remained here. but as a musician, i am more than a citizen. i am a citizen of this country in that eternal sense to which the genius of great music testifies. i know that a single performance of a great masterpiece was a stronger and more vital negation of the spirit of buchenwald and auschwitz than words.}
<A>__{an uncontrollable surge of anger wells up in steve, causing him to pace alarmingly. he grabs the baton from his desk, stands trembling before furtwangler, and snaps it in half. he pushes his face close to furtwangler, who recoils, terrified. david half stands, ready to intervene physically. during this emmi puts her fingers in her ears.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(quiet, terrifying)}
<D>__{have you ever smelled burning flesh? i smelt it four miles away. four miles away, i smelt it. have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? you talk to me about culture, art and music? you putting that in the scales, wilhelm? you setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? they had orchestras in the camps. they played beethoven, wagner. the hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. i don't understand the germans' relationship with music. what do you need music for? your pals you could call to save a few jews when millions of them were being annihilated? yes, i blame you for not getting hanged, i blame you for your cowardice. you strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king pin in a shithouse. you talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and i say to you, lies!}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<P>__{(breaking down)}
<D>__{i love my country, i believe in music, what was i to do?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{look around you. see the country you served. look at people who had real courage, who took risks, who risked their lives. like emmi's father.}
<A>__{he sees emmi has her fingers in her ears, yells at her.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{emmi, take your fingers out of your ears!}
<A>__{she does so.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i'm talking about your father.}
<A>__{she screams. stillness. all eyes on her.}
<C>__{emmi}
<D>__{my father only joined the plot when he realised that we could not win the war. she cries quietly.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{what kind of a world do you want, major? what kind of world are you going to make? do you honestly believe that the only reality is the material world, so you will be left nothing, nothing but feculence... more foul smelling than that which pervades your nights...}
<P>__{(near to breakdown)}
<D>__{how was i to understand, how was i to know what they were capable of? no one knew. no one knew.}
<A>__{he breaks down, buries his face in his hands, weeps.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i don't want to stay in this country. yes, i should have left in 1934, it would have been better if i'd left...}
<A>__{he is suddenly overtaken by nausea and faintness, stands, a hand to his mouth. emmi goes to him.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{get him out of here.}
<A>__{emmi helps furtwangler out. steve strides to the window, opens it, puts his head out into the fresh air.}
