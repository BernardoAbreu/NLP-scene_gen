<L>__{exterior wallace army camp day}
<A>__{a full encampment, across an english field; campfires chase the dawn chill. soldiers sharpen swords and spear points. wallace is huddled with his inner circle, all except campbell, who receives a report from a scout.}
<C>__{campbell}
<D>__{a royal entourage comes, flying banners of truce, and the standards of longshanks himself!}
<A>__{wallace buckles on his sword. an english pavilion tent yorkshire day set up for a meeting in a sunny meadow. wallace and his men ride in, wary, ready for ambush. they surround the tent. there are two dozen royal soldiers there, but they make no threatening moves. no sound from the tent. wallace rests his hand on the handle of his broadsword, ready.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{longshanks! i have come.}
<A>__{servants pull back the sides of the tent door, and a tall, slender, shapely female figure appears there. there in the shadows, she looks just like marion! william is not the only one who notices the resemblance; he glances at hamish and campbell and sees them haunted by it too. is this another dream? he pales, as she steps into the morning sun. she moves toward him, her face lowered. it is marion! she reaches him, lifts her face... and he sees the princess! william is relieved and yet as he sees the princess more closely he is still shaken by the resemblance in the way she carries herself, her shape, the fall of her hair. the princess is struck with wallace, too tall, powerful, and commanding. wallace dismounts, and moves to face her. their eyes hang on each other. she sees something that she has not seen in the face of a man in her whole life. she surprises him by bending at the knee, in a half submissive yet proud curtsey.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{i am the princess of wales.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{wife of edward, the king's son?}
<A>__{she nods; somehow she is already ashamed.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{i come as the king's servant, and with his authority.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{it's battle i want, not talk.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{but now that i am here, will you speak with a woman?}
<A>__{she leads him under the pavilion, a purple canopy shading rich carpets laid on the bare ground. watching the gorgeous walk, stephen lies back on his saddle and twitches his leg like a horny dog. hamish backhands him; campbell, hamish and stephen quickly dismount and follow the procession, shouldering their way in beside the princess's french guards, so they can watch wallace's back. the rest of the scots surround the tent, ready for ambush. nicolette is among the royal attendants there; seeing wallace, she shoots a glance at the princess that says ooo la la! the servants have brought a throne for the princess, a lower chair for wallace. she sits; he refuses the chair. she studies him, taking in his anger and his pride.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{i understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{i have been given nothing. god makes men what they are.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{did god make you the sacker of peaceful cities? the executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{york was the staging point for every invasion of my country. and that royal cousin hanged a hundred scots, even women and children, from the city walls.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{that is not possible.}
<A>__{but knowing longshanks' family, she glances at a richly dressed advisor, a crony of the king, who averts his eyes.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{longshanks did far worse, the last time he took a scottish city.}
<A>__{the crony mumbles to her in latin, with subtitles...}
<C>__{crony}
<P>__{(latin)}
<D>__{he is a murdering bandit, he lies.}
<C>__{wallace}
<P>__{(latin!)}
<D>__{i am no bandit. and i do not lie.}
<A>__{they are startled at wallace's fluency in latin.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{or in french if you prefer that: certainmous et ver! ask your king to his face, and see if his eyes can convince you of the truth.}
<A>__{she stares for a long moment at wallace's eyes.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{hamilton, leave us.}
<C>__{crony }
<D>__{m'lady }
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{leave us now.}
<A>__{he reluctantly obeys. seeing that she wants the exchange to be private, wallace turns and nods for his men to leave. stephen, who has been admiring the lady's beauty non stop, leans in and whispers to william...}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{her husband's more of a queen than she is. did you know that?}
<A>__{stephen moves off with hamish and campbell. wallace and the princess are left alone.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{let us talk plainly. you invade england. but you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. the king proposes that you withdraw your attack. in return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which i am to pay to you personally.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{a lordship. and gold. that i should become judas.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{peace is made is such ways.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{slaves are made in such ways!}
<A>__{the outburst startles even those watching from a distance. the princess is mesmerized by wallace's passion.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{i understand you have suffered. i know... about your woman.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{she was my wife. we married in secret because i would not share her with an english lord. they killed her to get to me. and she was pregnant.}
<A>__{the princess is stunned; wallace is dead still.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{i've never told anyone. i don't know why i tell you except because you look... much like her. and someday you will be a queen, and you must open your eyes!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{tell your king that william wallace will not be ruled. nor will any scot, while i live.}
<A>__{the princess rises slowly from her chair, moves in front of him, and lowers herself to her knees. the crony and her other attendants, seeing this from a distance, are shocked.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{sir. i leave this money, as a gift. not from the king, but from myself. and not to you, but to the orphans of your country.}
<A>__{she lifts her face. their eyes hold a moment too long. later, exterior field day wallace and his captains sit on horseback at the head of their company and watch as the princess' procession leaves. hamish studies wallace's face; wallace notices and gives him a non committal shrug. as the carriage rolls away, its window curtains lift back slightly. all they see are the princess' fingers, but they know she looked back. wallace reins his horse away, to ride back to camp.}
