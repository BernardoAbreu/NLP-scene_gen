<L>__{interior witwer's office day later}
<A>__{lisa sits biting her lip as witwer watches two monitors play the two versions of anderson's murder of witwer. lisa points.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{there.}
<A>__{she reaches down and freezes on a close up of anderson on the two monitors. close on the monitors on the left monitor anderson has blue eyes, on the right he has brown.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{the one on the left, the first disc it's a fake. he doesn't have blue eyes anymore.}
<A>__{witwer stares for a long time.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{a fake.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but the precogs predict the infallible truth. they don't emit fake discs.}
<A>__{and now lisa smiles. she has set her lawyerly mind to the solution. it is her moment.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{exactly. you can't tamper with the precogs, induce them to make fakes}
<C>__{lisa }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but that doesn't mean someone couldn't have made a fake disc on their own and inserted it into the delivery system.}
<A>__{the simplicity of it is inconceivable. witwer speaks carefully, trying to process it}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{bypass the precogs and slip a fake disc in with that day's real ones...}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{we're all programmed to believe anything we see on a precog disc. the system has never been wrong ...}
<A>__{witwer stares at the proof before him. the different colored eyes of anderson. he ejects both discs and holds them in his hands.}
<C>__{lisa }
<D>__{you have to call off the hunt. he was set up.}
<A>__{witwer looks at the two discs he is holding}
<C>__{witwer}
<P>__{(long beat)}
<D>__{it's gone too far, lisa she shakes her head, shocked at his response}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{he was set up! you both were. if paul kills you, you're both out of the picture. witwer who wants us out? of what picture?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{jesus, ed. stop this thing! and then we can investigate witwer's mouth opens and closes. he tries again.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{ennis page was murdered last night.}
<A>__{the blood drains from lisa's face}
<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{everything points to paul.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{he's not a murderer.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{i think he is. a murderer ... and a future murderer.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{lisa. what does it matter that the first disc is a fake ... if the second one's real?}
<A>__{witwer's hands close tight on the discs. lisa stands there, motionless. then she turns, and leaves his office, abruptly. he watches her go.}
