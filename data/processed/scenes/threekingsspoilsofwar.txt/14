<L>__{exterior desert day}
<A>__{from a distance we see a humvee sitting alone in the middle of a huge, empty desert. just the humvee, nothing else for miles. we hear the sound of a man making machine gun like noises.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{at at at at at. at at at at at.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{cu humvee it's like the opening scene all over again. jaeger is at the machine gun, epps sweeps the horizon with his binoculars, and wes is behind the wheel. only difference is that wes watches cnn footage of the air war on a watchman.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{at at at at at.}
<C>__{wes}
<P>__{(re: his tv)}
<D>__{this is so weird. it's happening, but it's not. it's like a tv show, and we're part of it.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{at at at at at.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{will you knock it off! damn, man. you're going to annoy the iraqis into submission.}
<A>__{jaeger gets down from the machine gun, pulls out his puzzle box and starts to work on it again.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{this is stupid. it's going on a month now. how long are they going to let the air force piss on those bastards? they can bomb them all they want, saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. what the hell is the army waiting for?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i've got to have something to tell people when i get home besides i protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{the longer the air force hits the iraqis, the safer it'ii be for us when we have to engage.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{you know what, wes? if you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you all want to lay off? god. i hope the iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{oh my god!}
<A>__{startled, epps and wes each pull their guns and spin in jaeger's direction expecting to have to fire at something.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what!? what!?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i did it! i got the box open.}
<A>__{jaeger has indeed opened the box. we can see something inside of it.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you almost got yourself shot, that's what you did.}
<A>__{wes excitedly goes over to jaeger.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{what's inside?}
<A>__{jaeger pulls out a small tube sealed with wax.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{it's...it's...i don't know what it is.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{it's a container. break the seal.}
<A>__{jaeger hesitates a beat, which heightens a bit of suspense. all three men can't help but be drawn closer to the container.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{go on, man.}
<A>__{jaeger pokes his finger through the wax and pulls it off the tube. he sticks his finger back into the container and draws out a rolled up piece of paper.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{paper.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it's a fortune box.}
<A>__{jaeger unrolls it.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{what's it say?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{help, i'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.}
<A>__{we see the paper. lines are drawn on it, large, crude figures. it's hard to make out exactly what it all is supposed to represent.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{it's a drawing, or something. some kind of art.}
<A>__{epps takes the paper from jaeger and gives it a once over.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{looks like something a kid would do.}
<A>__{wes takes the paper and looks it over.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{it's a map, i think that's what it is.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{there you go, jaeger. just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.}
<A>__{jaeger takes back the paper. all excited like a kid on christmas:}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{you think?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{yeah, that's exactly what i think. you and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes. let's get out of here. we got sand to protect.}
<A>__{epps and wes load up and get ready to move out. jaeger just keeps staring at the map, eyes lit like candles.}
