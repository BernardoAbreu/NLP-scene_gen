<A>__{it is nothing elaborate, a wire fence encloses a dirt yard. this compound is situated on the outskirts of apetown and the town is visible in the distance. there are about a dozen adult human captives within the enclosure, no more than a third of them females. some of them trudge around the dusty yard like convicts in a penitentiary. others squat against the sun drenched wall. a big male suddenly runs to the fence and tries to climb it. several guides, armed with whips and torches, immediately close in on him. the primitive recoils in fear from a fiery torch and rejoins the captives' circle.}
