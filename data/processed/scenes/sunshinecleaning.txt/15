<C>__{norah}
<D>__{the fact that we have sex, real coitus sex, means i'm under no obligation to blow you.}
<A>__{norah fires up the bud, inhales deeply and passes the can to randy, a good looking redneck in his early 20's.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{i think you're scared of it.}
<A>__{the phone rings. norah opens a book about sign language and starts practicing the sign alphabet. a b c d e f. f is a hard one.}

<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{dad, get the phone.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{there's absolutely no pressure here.}
<A>__{randy lies next to norah naked from the waist down. norah ignores him and continues forming letters with her fingers. she jots a note and sticks the pencil behind her ear. the phone rings again. norah reaches across randy and picks up the receiver.}

<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{i know, i know.}
<A>__{as norah holds the phone her eyes slide from randy's face to his off screen penis. she takes the pencil from behind her ear and, in the way you'd poke a hamster to see if it is dead or merely sleeping, prods randy's off screen penis.}
