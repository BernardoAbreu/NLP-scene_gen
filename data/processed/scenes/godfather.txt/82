<L>__{ext day: mall (winter 1945)}
<A>__{high angle of the mall. it is late afternoon. many strange cars are parked on the nearby streets. we can see the group of button men, stationed here and there, obviously sentries with concealed weapons. michael walks along in the rear yard. he is bundled in a warm marine coat. he looks at the strange men, regarding them with an uncertain awe. they look back at him, at first suspiciously and then with the respect of his position. he is like an exile prince. he wanders past them, and hesitates and looks at the yard. a rusted set of garden swings; and other home playground equipment. the basketball ring now half coming off. this is where he was a child. then a shout.}
