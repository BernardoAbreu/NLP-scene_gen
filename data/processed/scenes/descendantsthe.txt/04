<D>__{matt (v.o.) (cont'd) this is elizabeth king, my wife. twenty three days ago she was launched from a powerboat during a race and hit her head, almost drowned. now she's in a coma that scores 5 on the glasgow scale and 3 on the rancho los amigos scale, scores showing an extremely severe coma. liz is very competitive. whatever she does, she does to the fullest.}
