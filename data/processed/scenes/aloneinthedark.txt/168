<L>__{exterior street day 184}
<A>__{carnby and aline walk along a deserted street. the sun rises above them. it's a beautiful day. shops look ready to open. cars are parked along the streets. but no one is driving. the neighborhood is empty.}
<L>__{exterior downtown street day}
<A>__{carnby and aline walk down a wide street in the middle of the city's downtown core. no one is visible anywhere.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{edward... what's going on?}
<A>__{carnby looks ashen. they stand in the middle of a downtown intersection, empty streets stretching out in all directions.}

<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{then where the hell is everybody? where's everybody gone?}
<A>__{we look down at carnby and aline, alone in the intersection, empty streets all around them. we start to float up above them, getting a wider and wider bird's eye view of the city. we swoop up higher above them, but still, no one is visible anywhere in the city. we float up until the entire city stretches out below us. nothing moves. no one can be seen.}
<D>__{carnby (v.o.) (cont'd) here's what i know. there are two worlds on this planet. a world of light and a world of darkness. for millions of years, these worlds were in balance. but now, the lights of human civilization burn everywhere. the dark places are disappearing. we forced them to come out of the shadows. now, it's my job to force them back in. my name is edward carnby. i'm here to protect you from things you don't believe in.}
<A>__{we start to drop back down, faster and faster, the ground rushing towards us. we are descending directly above carnby and aline, standing alone in the empty intersection. we swoop down right in front of carnby. his trench coat blows in the wind. aline stands next to him, ready. carnby reloads his revolver.}

<D>__{aline...}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{yes edward?}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{it's going to be a busy day.}
<A>__{the sun shines down above them, illuminating the deserted city streets. carnby's expression is determined.}
