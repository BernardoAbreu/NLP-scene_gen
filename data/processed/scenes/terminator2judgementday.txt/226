<L>__{92a in the pickup. terminator has this trick (which you could do too if}
<A>__{you had servo driven steel fingers) where he smashes the cowl around a steering column with one blow from the palm of his hand. when it shatters he strips it away with a single move, and then turns the stub of the lock mechanism with his fingertips. this starts the vehicle. it takes about three seconds. in fact, he does it so quickly, the truck is running by the time john flips down the sun visor. a set of keys drops out and john catches them. dangles them in front of terminator's eyes.}
