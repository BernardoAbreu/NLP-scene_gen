<L>__{interior transport night}
<A>__{darkness. we just make out kyle and star among the other prisoners, most of whom are awake now in the steel container. star still wears her baseball cap. the prisoners are jostled as the transport touches down.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{we've landed.}
<L>__{exterior loading zone night}
<A>__{the transport has landed amongst numerous containers, cranes and vehicles all is dimly lit, enveloped in a vague reddish haze. the flying framework and armature detach from the transport, and take off into the air again leaving the trailer like wheeled container. something resembling the cab of a semi truck backs into position, latching onto attachment points on the container.}
<L>__{interior transport night}
<A>__{ a small panel slides open at the front of the transport, and a half dozen processing aerostats buzz inside from the cab. these are larger than the spy drones, with attached pincers that can encircle a person's arm. prisoners duck, try to dodge these things. but they quickly buzz from captive to captive, latching onto their arms we hear screams, see flashes of light from the aerostats. kyle tries to bat away an aerostat, but its pincers latch onto his forearm. a sizzling sound kyle cries out with the pain, a flash of red light then the aerostat detaches and moves to its next victim. star gets the same treatment from a different aerostat. she moves to kyle's side, tears in her eyes, sucking on her burned wrist to ease the pain.}
<C>__{star}
<D>__{what's going to happen to us?}

<D>__{i don't know...}
