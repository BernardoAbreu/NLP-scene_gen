<L>__{interior room of potentials (matrix) day}
<A>__{neo enters and finally understands the attention given to his age. the potentials are all little children. the room feels at once like a buddhist temple and a kindergarten class. the children's heads are either shaved or thick with dreadlocks. some are playing, others meditating or practicing their gift. neo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet blocks. a skinny boy holds a spoon which sways like a blade of grass as he bends it with his rnind. neo crosses to him, sits. the boy smiles as neo picks up a spoon and tries to imitate him. despite his best efforts, neo cannot make it bend.}
<C>__{spoon boy}
<D>__{your spoon does not bend because it is just that, a spoon. mine bends because there is no spoon, just my mind.}
<A>__{neo watches as it curls into a knot.}
<C>__{spoon boy}
<D>__{link yourself to the spoon. become the spoon and bend yourself.}
<A>__{neo nods, again holding up his spoon.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{there is no spoon. right.}
<A>__{he concentrates. the spoon begins to bend just as the priestess touches his shoulder.}
<C>__{priestess}
<D>__{the oracle will see you now.}
<A>__{spoon boy smiles.}
