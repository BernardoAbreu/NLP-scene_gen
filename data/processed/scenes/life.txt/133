<L>__{interior infirmary day}
<A>__{"oprah" blares on the television. old convicts linger about in various states of repose and decay. a young orderly pops to the music on his walkman as he pushes a cart through the ward. over at a table, ray and claude play poker with willie, a shaky old junkie and two young gang bangers. the currency on the table isn't poker chips, it's pills of various sizes and colors.}
<D>__{gang banger #1 two percodan.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i will raise you. gang banger #1 what the fuck are those?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{keeps your cholesterol down. gang banger #1 i look like i give a shit about my cholesterol?}
<A>__{gang banger #2 takes a quick hit of cocaine from a bullet. he notices ray staring at him.}
<D>__{gang banger #2 you want a bump, g?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i wouldn't be putting that shit up my nose. that came in in somebody's ass. it's like you're sniffin' ass. maybe that's your thing, but it ain't mine.}
<A>__{ray pushes his bet to the center of the table. the shaky junkie folds. willie tosses in some pills and turns to gang banger #2.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{looks like it's up to you, stinky ass sniffer.}
<A>__{glaring, gang banger #2 flips a big pill into the pot.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{thorazine? well, that's a little rich for my blood.}
<A>__{he tosses down his cards. the shaky junkie attempts to light a cigarette. the match slips from his trembling fingers and falls into his lap.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{damn fool gonna set this place on fire one of these days.}
<A>__{gang banger #1 folds. it's back to ray.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i got three stool softeners left.}
<P>__{(to gang banger #2)}
<D>__{that oughta be right up your alley.}
<A>__{the remaining players match the pot. gang banger #2 reveals his cards. willie frowns. ray lays down his cards and victoriously sweeps his winnings into a paper cup. across the room, nurse humphries enters with a tray of snacks. she, too, is showing the years.}
<C>__{nurse humphries}
<D>__{who wants jell o?}
<A>__{the magic word. the poker players join a stampede of oldsters in a clatter of canes, walkers and artificial limbs. ray and claude are left alone at the table.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{hey, where you going? we got money on the table here!}
<A>__{claude glances around to ensure that he's not overheard.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{you know, ray, i've been chewing on what you said this afternoon. i think i got a plan.}
<A>__{ray gives claude a long look.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{shh! is that so hard to believe?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{don't tell me, i don't want to hear it. it's probably all fucked up, anyway.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{you don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. there's no shame in that.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{it's too late for plans.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{never thought i'd hear ray gibson say that. hell with you then. you'd only slow me down anyway.}
<A>__{ray turns away as claude walks off. a doddering inmate stands nearby slurping on jell o. his robe hangs open.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{hey, man, cover that shit up!}
<A>__{disgusted, ray discards his own jell o. he pulls out his daddy's pocket watch and checks the time. the little mechanical tune nags at him. he snaps the lid shut and considers the watch resting in the palm of his hand.}
