<A>__{walking. darkness. the cave is even tighter now. the light flickers, some kind of electrical disturbance, then goes out completely we hear andrew curse, fumbling with it, and the nightvision mode comes on.}
<T>__{cut:}
<A>__{the nightvision is scrambling badly. all the forms are distorted and then }
<C>__{steve }
<D>__{can you believe this, this is nuts }
<A>__{the nightvision is turned off, revealing matt. they've come into a larger chamber in the cave, one somehow lit from within; the boys are bathed in a softly pulsing turquoise glow. they speak loudly, clearly talking over something we can't hear.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{is that, is that showing up on the camera?}
<C>__{andrew }
<D>__{i don't wanna film it, it's messing with the camera }
<A>__{matt forcibly turns the camera, to reveal steve standing next to some kind of massive crystalline rock structure growing from, or maybe embedded in, the wall. around it, and him, float wispy little clouds of light, turquoise and beautiful. steve is clearly entranced, sweeping his hands through the light.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{touch one!}
<A>__{we see matt, now also surrounded by the little aurora borealis like clouds, touch one; it comes apart in a silent little explosion of light, beautiful.}
<C>__{andrew }
<D>__{guys maybe...maybe we shouldn't...}
<A>__{a light cloud passes in front of andrew, and we sees his hand to extend to touch it. the subsequent little light burst badly warps the camera, clearly permanent damage.}
