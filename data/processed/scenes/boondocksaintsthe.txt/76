<A>__{we see the fuzzy reflection of a cheap porno movie being reflected in vincenzo's elvis style sunglasses. he is shaking as he masturbates.}
<C>__{vincenzo}
<P>__{(grunting, muttering)}
<D>__{don't you talk to me like that, you dirty little... give it to daddy... give it ta da king... garbage mouth, garbage mouth.}
<L>__{interior sin bin small room night}
<A>__{rocco is looking through the peep hole down on vincenzo. he still holds the terrified, crying dancer.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{oh man. he is some sicko.}
<A>__{they back up and focus on the money slot. a hundred dollar bill comes through. connor gives it to the dancer.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{you've earned this.}
<A>__{the boys begin to recite their prayer. rocco is smiling and excited, he still hangs on to the now hyperventilating dancer. they press the button. the door goes straight up. vincenzo has one moment of shock before the macmanuses decimate him through the glass with silenced bullets. the glass silently spiders and begins to fall in spots. his chest explodes, sputtering medallions and bits of gold chain inside the booth. the dancer faints and rocco lays her down gently. the boys step down in the boot and begin their ritual. rocco watches intently, intrigued. they finish and turn around to see rocco is immersed in grabbing one of the unconscious dancer's breasts. they pull up their masks.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{what the fuck are you doing?}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{i i will tip her.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{we've teamed up with a sex offender.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{so, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{all right. i'm sorry. i'm pathetic.}
<A>__{he gets up and starts tossing money on her as the boys giggle. just then two more bills come through the slots of the other two doors, which have remained closed. murphy looks through left peep hole, connor the right. smiles spread across their faces and they look at each other. they switch and each looks through the other guy's peep hole.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{what? what is it?}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{this place is like a scumbag yard sale.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{we gotta come down here once a week and clean house.}
<A>__{rocco looks in one. he says "oh, wow" as he crosses and checks out the other one.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{you sure about this guy?}
<A>__{the boys look at each other affirmatively.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{oh man. you gotta let me do these guys. i'm such a moron. i gotta make up for the tit thing.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{no way. i've been waitin' for this asshole.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{aw, c'mon. i gotta clear my family name here. i've brought shame to the house of della rocco.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{give the guy a shot.}
<C>__{connor}
<P>__{(thinks it over)}
<D>__{rocco, this is the real deal. we must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. evil man, dead man.}
<A>__{rocco gets serious and nods his head. connor replaces the clip in his gun and hands it to rocco. murphy does the same. he stands with one in each hand, aiming one gun at each door. the boys both place a finger on the appropriate orange buttons, as rocco slowly cocks his head back. with wide eyes he thrusts his head forward. the doors fly up. rocco fires both guns yelling "yeah, take it, take it!" both the drug dealer from outside and the pimp from the emergency room are destroyed. rocco then crosses his arms and fires two more shots from each gun. on the opposing walls of each booth two identical bullet holes appear.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{wyatt fuckin' earp, man!}
