<L>__{interior ice skating rink night}
<A>__{near closing time. darnell and autumn lurch and stumble around the ice, collapsing against the boards now and then. there are few other skaters at this hour.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{yes, i figure the key is to go places only white people go. next time we'll go bowling.}
<A>__{autumn laughs, as the house lights start to blink, indicating it's closing time.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{plus i saw this in rocky. i never believed a guy who was supposed to be an athlete would skate that bad, but now i know.}
<A>__{they make their way to an opening in the boards, stumble over to a bench, begin to unlace.}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{thanks, that was fun, sort of.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{you were pretty good for the first time.}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{well, it's not really my first time. my dad took me skating once.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{he used to play ball for e.s.u., didn't he?}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{yeah, how'd you know that?}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{i saw his picture on the wall of fame. you got his eyes. luckily, you didn't get his thighs.}
<A>__{she laughs, looks at him a beat, starts to come forward to kiss him. he puts a finger to her lips.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{make sure you mean it this time.}
<A>__{she hesitates a beat, then comes forward again. they fall into a deep kiss. we pull back to longshot. two people alone in the expanse of the ice rink. the lights flicker and go out.}
