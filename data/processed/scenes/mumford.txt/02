<L>__{exterior boarding house day}
<A>__{old three story gothic house in ill repair beyond a peeling picket fence and a scruffy yard. the sign says rooms to rent. the newcomer goes in the gate.}
<C>__{follett }
<D>__{...oh yeah, one other thing i need an angle.}
<A>__{he squints through the dirty screen door but sees nothing, then knocks and turns away to survey the neighborhood.}
<C>__{follett }
<D>__{i was thinking if it weren't for bad luck, i wouldn't have any luck at all...}
<C>__{landlady }
<D>__{can i help you?}
<A>__{the newcomer turns toward the door. standing there, holding the screen open, is the landlady. she's a knockout in a cheap, small town way: a cotton dress that buttons down the front and clings with sweat to her generous curves.}
<C>__{follett }
<D>__{either my luck had just changed, or fate just bought me another round of trouble.}
