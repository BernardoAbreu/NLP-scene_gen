<A>__{the faucet drips. julie turns the handle. no success. she checks the lock on each window. she stands for a moment. she picks up a bag of chips and eats a handful. she opens the fridge and takes out a can of nacho cheese sauce. she grabs a soft drink and a jar of bread and butter pickles. she gets some cookies from a shelf. she thinks. opens the freezer, pulls out some fat free sorbet. she takes the whole mess toward her bedroom.}
