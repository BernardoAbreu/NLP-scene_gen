<L>__{int jill's apartment dawn}
<A>__{chris walks into a characterless apartment. he quietly sheds his clothes. even in silhouette, we can see that his body is in perfect shape, not pumped, but lean and tight. moving lithely, with the natural grace of a cat, he eases himself into a bed where... ...a beautiful young girl, jill valentine, seems to be fast asleep. as chris nestles in beside her, we see that her eyes, facing away, are open. chris gently drapes an arm around her and lets his body relax.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(a whisper) glad you're still}
<D>__{here, lady}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{it's my apartment.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(surprised) you're awake.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{i've been awake. since you left.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{his apology goes no further. he's still troubled by what happened in the hills.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{there was... something wrong.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{what, with my dinner? i never had a mother. i will learn.}
<A>__{chris smiles politely. he offers...}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i will do the cooking.}
<A>__{...but he can't switch focus.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{on the mountain...there...must have been something... prowling around up there.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{there are probably all kinds of things prowling around up there. in the middle of the night.}
<A>__{chris apologizes again, this time more sincerely.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i'm sorry. really. you...have to be there at dawn. they ride the wind over the ridge.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{dawn? you left at one a.m.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i had to go fishing. it's the fish that bring them down, so i can get}
<P>__{a close look at them. (enthused)}
<D>__{i've tracked a dozen of them, jill. twelve of those big bruisers. i can actually recognize them. i've even given them names, over the years.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{you've been doing this for years?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{only in the early autumn. when they're' migrating.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{i'ii set the alarm for nexterior october.}
<A>__{jill rolls over and faces him.}
<C>__{jill }
<D>__{i wish i could get excited. really. that's the truth. as excited as you, over such... simple things.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{beauty... isn't simple. if it was... i'd be beautiful.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{you are.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{no, no, no. i'm simple. you, on the other hand...(nuzzling closer)...have all that... stuff... hiding underneath somewhere. that's what fascinates me.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{fascination. not love?}
<A>__{jill is being playful. chris, taking her question to heart, becomes introspective.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i... honestly don't know. i guess i've been... living alone too long. you're the first, the only woman i've ever thought of as... a real partner.}
<A>__{now jill becomes introspective.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{i've always been...afraid of living alone. i've always had... people... talking at me... knowing they could wind me up and i'd do... (shrug) ... whatever they wanted.}
<A>__{chris looks into her eyes. she kisses him gently.}
<C>__{jill }
<D>__{we all have... something hidden... underneath. beauty may not be simple. but it's not all that complicated, either. most of the time, you find it... right in the middle of all the... confusion.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i'm part mohawk. indians are never confused. at least, they never let it show.}
<A>__{they kiss again, this time more passionately. rolling over, they begin to make love.}
