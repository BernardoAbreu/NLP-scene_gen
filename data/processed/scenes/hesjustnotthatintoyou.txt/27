<A>__{gigi sits at her desk, janine standing by her side. she's got a few sheets of paper on her desk. gigi takes a deep breath, picks up the office phone and dials. janine gives her a thumbs up.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{it's ringing.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{pretty standard.}
<C>__{gigi}
<P>__{(listening to receiver)}
<D>__{yes! voicemail.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{your notes.}
<A>__{gigi nods it's all under control.}
<C>__{gigi}
<P>__{(reading off her paper)}
<D>__{hey, conor. it's gigi. i just thought, i hadn't heard from you and, i mean how stupid is it that a gal has got to wait for a guy's call anyway, right?}
<A>__{gigi laughs, but as she looks back to the notes, she seems confused. she turns to janine, panicked, mouthing "what does this say?". janine looks she's no help.}
<C>__{gigi }
<P>__{(clearly ad libbing)}
<D>__{i mean, we're all equal, right? more than equal more women are accepted into law school now than men, and we do better in those police simulations where you can mistakenly shoot innocent people }
<P>__{(rifles through the pages)}
<D>__{ i mean i don't know if you saw that dateline but women practically have penises now, right?}
<P>__{(looks to janine, helpless)}
<D>__{well, call me. this is gigi. call me.}
<A>__{gigi hangs up, unsure. she looks to janine.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{don't worry. he's totally gonna call.}
