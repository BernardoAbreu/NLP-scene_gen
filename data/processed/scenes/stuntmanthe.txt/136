<L>__{124 wider angle interior nina's hotel bedroom night}
<A>__{they are in bed in a pleasant large room (the queen anne suite), untidy, with script pages, wigs, costumes, fresh flowers, the leftovers of a room service dinner. nina caresses his back, noticing bruises. she kisses them gently and starts to giggle. he looks at her quizzically.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{that's twice for me today. now. and when i watched you do the stunt.}
<A>__{the alarm clock on the dresser begins ringing. he sits up, puzzled.}
<C>__{nina }
<D>__{i have to study my scene for tomorrow. the old lady at the cemetery. it's brutal. i set the clock in case we dozed off.}
<A>__{cameron gets up, moving toward the dresser to turn off the clock, but instead stops at the stand holding the old lady wig. he runs his fingers through it as the clock continues to ring.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{how come they cast you as an old lady?}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{i start out as a young girl hiding this american flyer. i'm austrian... will ya turn off the clock?}
<A>__{subtly, we sense something is bothering cameron. he ignores the still ringing clock.}
<C>__{nina }
<D>__{anyway, his patriotism is stronger than his love and he leaves me with another little patriot in my belly.}
<A>__{during this he has taken the wig and puts it over his head, glancing in the mirror.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{why can't i double for both of you? i could use the money and i don't look half bad.}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(seriously)}
<D>__{honey, you'll ruin it. take it off.}
<A>__{he does.}
<C>__{nina }
<D>__{the clock's electric. it'll ring forever.}
<A>__{instead of turning off the clock, he crosses to the old lady's dress on a hanger. he looks at the dress appraisingly.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{eli might really go for that, the big soldier as a little old lady.}
<A>__{disturbed, nina leaves the bed, turns off the alarm clock and adjusts the wig properly on its stand.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{everything's beautiful.}
<A>__{they embrace and cling to each other. she starts back for the bed, but he detours for the clock and pulls out the alarm again, and again it begins ringing.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{we've got to consider eli. if you don't study the scene, he'll be mad...then you'll get mad...and i will get shot out of a cannon.}
<A>__{with the alarm still ringing, he starts toward the bed.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{did you fall on your head today?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{i want it to ring.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{for me, that's why. that's eli yelling for you to work on your scene and us saying, "up yours, eli," and i like that.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{do you want to leave?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{i want to make love to you while eli is screaming his head off.}
<A>__{the whole idea is so incongruous that she starts laughing. he gets on the bed with her. the alarm continues to ring. they struggle about, giggling at the absurdity.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{i can't make love with the clock ringing.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{betcha can.}
<A>__{while he moves over her body, she grabs a pillow and hurtles it at the clock. it falls over, but keeps on ringing. by now, cameron has entered nina and she is rapidly becoming more involved in that, than in the clock.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(to ringing clock while making love to nina)}
<D>__{you tell 'em, eli.}
<B>__{close on moviola}
<A>__{in the darkness, the machine is like an ominous hunchback, splattering shards of light against chuck's intensely watching face. he is highly disturbed at the unseen image.}
<C>__{chuck}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{crazy bastard!}
<A>__{angle widens, showing a small storage room has been converted to a makeshift editing room, where chuck sits working the moviola. slowly becoming aware of someone, he glances up through the spinning reels and dimly sees cameron leaning in the doorway.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{there was no way it could go wrong...unless he just went ape.}
<A>__{cameron ambles over as chuck reverses the film to see it one more time. even as he catches a glimpse of the film whirring backward, he realizes he's seeing burt's death scene in the water. now chuck has reached the beginning of the film and is moving it forward again.}
