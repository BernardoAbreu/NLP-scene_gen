<L>__{interior penthouse restaurant day}
<A>__{it's one large empty concrete box with big picture windows all the way round. wires are hanging from the ceiling and walls where the lights will eventually be fixed. a tall figure stands at the opposite end, facing the setting sun. he is just a silhouette. carter and glenda enter and walk towards the man. the silhouette turns as he nears it. it's brumby.}
<C>__{brumby}
<D>__{a new venture of mine. it's going to be a restaurant.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{do you like it?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{brumby}
<D>__{last night, after you'd gone, i did a little bit of asking around. seeing as you weren't very forthcoming,}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother?}
<P>__{(pause) i got to thinking it would}
<D>__{be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke i wanted off my back,}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you know my life. machines. the arcades. nice business. looks after itself. people put money in. i take it out. not much rough stuff. it's a business that makes me very happy. but recently, i've had a spot of bother,}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{one of my lads gets a bit over anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. the upshot is i've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{so far as i'm concerned, that's it. apparently not. these people i've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit,}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{so i'm worried. i can't fight them i haven't that kind of set up. but i've got to fix them before they fix me. trouble is, if i try and they find out, i'm dead.}
<A>__{brumby picks up a black briefcase. he holds it up to carter.}
<C>__{brumby}
<D>__{five grand. it belongs to you. along with a little name i'm going to give you.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{what name?}
<C>__{brumby}
<D>__{kinnear. cyril kinnear.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{kinnear did it.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{brumby}
<D>__{i don't know. all i know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last saturday. your brother's name was mentioned. next day, he was dead.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{brumby}
<D>__{i don't know. that's all i was told.}
<A>__{carter takes a last look at glenda and walks slowly back towards the entrance.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{that's not good enough.}
<C>__{brumby}
<D>__{christ, what...}
<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{do me a favour. you don't really expect me to fix kinnear on your say so?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. stroll on.}
<C>__{brumby}
<D>__{jack, you're wrong.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{good afternoon, mr brumby. carter exits.}
<C>__{brumby}
<D>__{jack...}
