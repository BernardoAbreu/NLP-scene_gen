<D>__{you read your fan mail now?}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{i would hardly call him a fan. he despised me. but he was quite insistent i attend his funeral and tell you what became of anna and her mother. so here i am and that's your answer: omnis cellula e cellula.}

<D>__{just like her, yes.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{were you married then?}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{not when she died, no. i was insufferable long before anna, my dear. grief doesn't change you, hazel, it reveals you.}

<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{hazel, i'm trying. i'm trying! you asked me to tell you what happens and i wish i could do that. i wish that i could. but i can't. no one can. no one knows, hazel. they don't talk to us. unless...}
<A>__{van houten takes out a typed piece of paper. he hands it to hazel who grabs it and immediately crumples it into a ball.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{you think i care about that? i don't give a shit, van houten.}
<A>__{hazel throws the piece of paper at van houten.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{you're a drunk and a jerk and a failure. and i'd like you to get out of my car right now so i can go home and grieve.}
<C>__{van houten}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{but }
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{get out of the car!}
<A>__{van houten knows he's too late. he does as he's told, stepping out of the car onto the side of the road. he stands there as hazel peels out. in the rearview mirror, she sees him raise the flask, as if toasting her. she blinks away some tears and drives. cut to:}
