<L>__{interior office building day}
<A>__{ray crosses a carpeted closed area. he mounts a flight of stairs. at the top of the stairs there's a plain blonde wood door. ray punches in a code on a security panel next to it. the door opens automatically. ray passes through and goes down a narrow hall. at the end of the hall there is a small elevator. again ray punches in a code. the elevator opens and ray goes in. the elevator door closes, but the elevator does not move. ray waits. finally, a woman's voice comes through a speaker.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{who is it please?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{raymond harris ... 20743.}
<A>__{the elevator begins to move up. when it stops, the door opens and ray walks into a windowless reception area where a beautiful italian woman sits behind a large, blonde, modern, built in desk.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<P>__{(very quietly)}
<D>__{you may go right in, ray.}
<A>__{ray crosses to a blonde wood double door and waits. the receptionist pushes a button behind her desk chimes sound as the double doors open to an enormous office with no windows. heavy rich brown curtains line the walls. ray enters and the doors close behind him. ray takes a few steps forward, then stops. there is a solid glass wall that we now notice running the width of the office. cut into the glass wall is a small speaker microphone apparatus. beyond the glass off in the center of the room is a man sitting in a very plain, blonde, wood, modern, yet not motorized, wheelchair. the man is paralyzed except for his right hand and head. his head appears small in relation to the size of his body. his suit is immaculate and one of the finest we've ever seen. his manservant stands in the shadows behind him.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{good afternoon mr. roque. (pronounced rowk).}

<D>__{shut everything down ... is that something that...do you want us to shut everything down?}
<A>__{silence. ray doesn't know what to do. he struggles to interpret mr. roque's silence. he waits. mr. roque does nothing but stare.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{then we'll shut everything down.}
<A>__{silence. ray turns. the doors open as he approaches them and he leaves the room. the doors close.}
