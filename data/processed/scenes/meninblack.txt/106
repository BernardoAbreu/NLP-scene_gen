<L>__{exterior street key kiosk day}
<A>__{kay's ltd screeches to a halt in front of the kiosk on orchard street. jay and kay leap out and jay spots the vendor, closing up the shop. he's wearing a dirty cardigan, watch cap, and fingerless gloves, his face aquiver with ticks and mannerisms. he has a small dog in front of him. jay rolls his eyes as they step up to the counter.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{of course that guy's an alien. that's gotta be the worst disguise i've ever seen.}
<A>__{a voice answers him, but not the vendor's.}
<C>__{frank the pug}
<D>__{you don't like it, you can kiss my furry little butt.}
<A>__{jay looks down. the voice is coming from the dog. this is frank the pug. kay approaches, motioning to jay to make sure no one hears.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{you busy, frank?}
<C>__{frank the pug}
<D>__{sorry, kay, i can't talk right now, my ride's leaving in }
<A>__{kay grabs frank. he yelps like, well, a dog.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{call the pound. we got a stray.}
<C>__{frank the pug}
<D>__{hey! get your paws off me!}
<A>__{passerbys glare at kay, who appears to be seriously mistreating this poor little dog. jay tries to explain.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{the, uh...dog owes my friend some money.}
<C>__{kay}
<P>__{(to frank)}
<D>__{arquillians and bugs. what do you know?}
<C>__{frank the pug}
<D>__{i know nothing.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{not a thing?}
<A>__{kay shakes frank the pug, trying to force an answer.}
<C>__{frank the pug}
<D>__{stop it. okay, okay. rosenberg wasn't some two bit arquillian. he was the guardian of a galaxy. they thought he would be safe here on earth.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{and the bug had other plans.}
<C>__{frank the pug}
<D>__{the galaxy is the best source for subatomic energy in the universe. if the bugs get their slimy claws on it, kiss the arquillians goodbye.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{ask him about the belt.}
<C>__{kay}
<P>__{(to frank)}
<D>__{rosenberg said something about a galaxy on "orion's belt." what's he talking about, frank?}
<C>__{frank the pug}
<D>__{beats me.}
<A>__{kay shakes frank the pug once more.}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(to a person passing by)}
<D>__{they're rehearsing a ventriloquist act.}
<C>__{frank the pug}
<D>__{the galaxy is here.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{here?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{the galaxy is hundreds of millions of stars and planets? how's it here?}
<A>__{if a dog can smirk, frank does.}
<C>__{frank the pug}
<D>__{you humans, when're you gonna learn that size doesn't matter? just 'cause something's important, doesn't mean it's not very, very small.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{how small?}
<C>__{frank the pug}
<D>__{tiny. like the size of a marble. or a jewel. now if you'll excuse me, i need to be walked before the flight.}
<A>__{kay lets go of frank, turns to jay, who is lost in thought.}
<C>__{kay}
<P>__{(to frank the pug)}
<D>__{get out of here.}
<P>__{(then to jay)}
<D>__{the galaxy's here. it's not on orion's belt.}
<A>__{jay suddenly notices frank the pug bark at a cat farther down the sidewalk.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{kay...}
