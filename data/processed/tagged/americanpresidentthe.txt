<D>__{a.j., did you get one of these?}

<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{is that the letter from solomon at the gdc?}
<C>__{shepherd}

<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{what they want is a 20 percent reduction in fossil fuel emissions.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{it won't pass at 20 percent.}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{we haven't really tried.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{lewis, mcsorley, mccluskey and shane hold too many markers. if we try to push this through and lose, there will be a very loud thud when we hit the ground, and that's not what you want in an election year.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{talk to the gdc again, a.j. tell them the president resents the implication that he's turned his back on the environment. tell them i will send 455 to the floor. but we're gonna ask for a 10 percent reduction. if they want to pull their support, fine. at 63 percent job approval rating. i don't need their help getting a bill passed. we gotta get going where's leon?}
<C>__{a.j.}
<P>__{(to an aide)}

<C>__{a.j.}
<P>__{(to the aide)}
<D>__{never mind.}
<A>__{leon kodak comes into the oval office. the white house pollster is a likable, if clumsy, numbers whiz. he, along with a.j., lewis, and robin, are regarded as the president's starting team. the people in this room have grown very close over the past few years.}
<C>__{kodak}
<D>__{excuse me. good morning, mr. president.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{you all right?}
<C>__{kodak}
<D>__{they keep moving that big ficus plant.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{we're all here, mr. president.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{okay. first, i wanted to say congratulations. three years ago, we were elected to the white house by one of the narrowest margins in history, and today kodak tells us 63 percent of registered voters think we're doing a good job.}
<C>__{kodak}
<D>__{wait a second. you wanted me to poll registered voters?}
<A>__{everyone laughs... even shepherd smiles...}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{but the poll also tells us what we already knew: we don't get this crime bill of ours through congress and these numbers are gonna be a memory. so, starting today, we're shifting it into gear.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{can i tell my morning press gaggle that gun control }
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{crime control, robin. gun control means we're wimps and we're soft on crime.}

<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{we're leaving 'em out.}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{sir, we campaigned on this issue. now, i understand we took it out when we were in the low forties, but we can push it through now.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{after the elections.}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{sir, we may never have an opportunity like this again. let's take this 63 percent out for a spin and see what it can do.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{we can't take it out for a spin, lewis. we need it to get re elected. for reasons passing understanding, people do not relate guns to gun related crime.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{robin, you can brief the press this afternoon. as of today, the crime bill's priority one on the president's domestic agenda.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{got it.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{leon, you're gonna run the war room. we're gonna need detailed projections for all the target districts by the end of the week. and, leon, don't be a nice, sweet guy from brooklyn. do what the n.r.a. does.}
