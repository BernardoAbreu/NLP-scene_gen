<A>__{ilence.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{and the commonwealth heads of government meeting. i spoke to the prime minister of malawi, who was saying how much he appreciated your tough stance on nigeria.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i meant to tell you at the time but you were being monopolised rather.}
<A>__{ilence.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i imagine those occasions are quite difficult. twenty four heads of government each clamouring for a private audience..}
<A>__{silence. tony takes a deep breath, then..}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{also, we haven't had a chance to speak since that week. and i wanted to offer my apologies..}
<A>__{the queen looks up..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{whatever for?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{in case you'd felt `manhandled' or `managed' in any way.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{not at all. beat.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i don't think i shall ever understand what happened this summer.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{the circumstances were exceptional, ma'am. and in the end, you showed great personal strength, courage, and humility. e}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{ou're confusing humility with humiliation.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{that's not true.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{you didn't hear what they were saying in the mall that friday.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i still believe history will show it was a good week for you.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{and an even better one for you, mr blair.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{but there are fifty two weeks in a year, ma'am. and two and a half thousand in a half century.}
<A>__{the queen looks up. thrown by his compliment..}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{and when people come to assess your legacy, no one will remember those few days.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{you don't feel that what respect or affection people might once have had for..}
<A>__{she wants to say `me', but instead says..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{..this institution has been diminished?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{not at all. pause..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i gather some of your closest advisors were less fulsome in their support..}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{one or two. but as a leader one has...a different perspective.}
<P>__{a beat)}
<D>__{i could never have added my voice to the chorus.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{you're very kind.}
<A>__{the queen looks at tony, raises an eyebrow..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{but let's also not forget the more pragmatic reason.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{which is?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{that without me there to distract everyone, it'd suddenly become embarrassingly clear how much unchecked power the british prime minister actually has.}
<A>__{tony looks up..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{if fifty years of doing my job has taught me anything, it is that the people doing yours generally prefer me with all my faults to some kind of meddling president..}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{just look at the french.}
<A>__{the queen opens her handbag, and takes out her reading glasses.. e}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{i suppose we'd better get on with the business in hand..}
<A>__{the queen looks out of the window. notices how the sun is setting..}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{i do love this time of day. shall we walk while there's still some sunshine left? i do hope you're a walker.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{good. the clocks go back next week, then it'll be dark by five.}
<A>__{tony and the queen get to their feet.}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{i always think these meetings stand a better chance of succeeding if the prime minister is a walker.}
<A>__{footmen open the door as tony and the queen go out of the audience room, and into..}
<L>__{interior corridor buckingham palace day}
<A>__{blair and the queen turns a corner, and emerge into a corridor from the audience room...}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{as a matter of fact, it's how i think best. on my feet. i've never been one for sitting around endlessly. a good walk and fresh air sorts everything out..}
<A>__{unexpectedly, she stops. and suddenly we realize she's been holding something back..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{one in four, you said? wanted to get rid of me? t}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{for about half an hour. but then you came down to london and all that went away.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i've never been hated like that before.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{no. and that must have been difficult.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{it was. very.}
<A>__{they begin walking again..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{ever since diana people want glamour and tears..the grand performance..and i'm not very good at that. i prefer to keep my feelings to myself. foolishly i believed that's what people wanted from their queen. not to make a fuss nor wear one's heart on one's sleeve, duty first... self second.}
<A>__{the queen stops..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{it's how i was brought up. it's all i've ever known}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{one forgets. you were so young when you became queen.}
<A>__{the queen drifts off..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i was. a girl.}
<A>__{then pulls herself back..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{but i can see the world has changed. and one must 'modernise'.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{well, perhaps that's where i can help.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<P>__{(with a twinkle as they set off)}
<D>__{don't get ahead of yourself prime minister, i think you'll find that i'm supposed to be advising you!}
<L>__{interior buckingham palace grand staircase day}
<A>__{the corridor outside. as the queen passes janvrin, he surreptitiously looks at his watch, and raises his eyebrow. the queen smiles..}
<L>__{interior buckingham palace gardens day}
<A>__{footmen open double doors which lead out into the gardens. the queen and the prime minister walk out..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{so...what might we expect in your first parliament?}
<A>__{tony clears his throat, then..}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{well, ma'am, top of the list is education reform. we want to radically reduce classroom sizes...}
<A>__{our camera slowly pulls back over the gardens, until the queen and tony are two dots in the distance... time has moved on. sand has covered the footprints. the momentary hiccup that was `diana' already long forgotten..}
