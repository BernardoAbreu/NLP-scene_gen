<B>__{reader note}
<A>__{one thing that will be obvious to viewers, but not to readers, is that the nine principal parts in this film are played by only three actors:}
<L>__{1) gary, gavin, gabriel 2) sarah, susan, sierra 3) margaret, melissa, mary}
<A>__{it'll make more sense in contexterior promise. a man's hand unwinds a short length of green string. we're extremely close, with a shallow, blurry focus. it's like the first moments after a dream just fragments. scissors cut the string. the man wraps it around his left wrist. a loop. a bracelet. we see the man's teeth, the edge of his chin as he pulls the knot tight. his fingers pull against the string. solid. it won't break easily.}
<T>__{fade out:}
<B>__{pitch black}
<A>__{there's no music. no sound at all, really, except for some distant birds chirping. then a squeak. a squeal as rusty springs engage. a garage door lifts, revealing gary banks in silhouette. he's 30, effortlessly fit, with movie star good looks. (although for now, he's merely a tv star.) like most laurel canyon garages, this one has never held a car. instead, it's the resting place for all the detritus of bachelordom: shitty ikea furniture, a drum set, a styrofoam snowman, and the harley he always meant to get running. gary spots what he was looking for.}

<A>__{gary drags a beaten weber kettle. one of its wheels is broken, scraping against the deck. wider, we see gary's house has an incredible view of the city. he couldn't fucking care less. he yanks the circular grill out of the weber and throws it down the canyon. he empties a garbage bag into the barbecue: mostly women's clothes, but also some stuffed animals and photos still in their frames. there's too much to fit, so he tries stomping it down with a flip flopped foot. he cracks open a container of lighter fluid and begins drenching everything inside. he sprays until the container is wheezing air. he shakes it, making sure it's really empty. then he cracks open a new container and keeps spraying. and spraying. we follow the dripping fluid as it runs across a photo of gary and a blonde woman. her eyes are scratched out, making her unrecognizable. under the grill, lighter fluid is dripping in a stream, soaking into the wooden deck. finally satisfied, gary throws the lighter fluid aside. he takes five steps back and pulls a box of matches from his pocket.}
<L>__{extremely close as the match scrapes, erupting in flames.}
<A>__{on gary's left wrist, we see a green string bracelet. music starts: a pounding, hypnotic track that will carry us through these main titles. in epic slow motion, we follow the burning match as it sails through the air, tumbling end over end. just as it's about to reach its target, we...}

<A>__{gary's at the wheel, driving, as he finishes a fifth of bourbon. jump cuts take us out of hollywood, heading downtown. our travelling music is serving us well. gary stops at a light. he looks left and sees himself on the side of a bus. it's an ad for crime lab ("this fall, mondays are killer.") gary watches himself drive away.}

<A>__{further along, gary spots two thuggy teenagers sitting on a low wall. he calls out to them:}

<D>__{yes, hello. i'm having a medical situation. yes. okay. i don't have a belly button.}
<P>__{(explaining carefully)}

<A>__{he sits down on the edge of the bed.}
<C>__{gary }
<D>__{can a person live without a belly button? because if you think about it, you're born with one. so if you don't have one, you're unborn and it's really hazy whether you're alive or not. i guess i'm wondering: am i alive?}

<A>__{sitting in the back seat. all three garys give each other thumbs up. driver gary looks out the driver side window, where he sees shoes and asphalt. only now do we rotate to reveal we're upside down. gary has rolled the car. the music suddenly stops. we hear sirens approaching.}

<A>__{gary scans the shelves, looking for something to read. there are five times more books here than gary has opened in his lifetime. he settles on a paperback of voltaire's candide. he lies back on the couch, reading it. he flips a few pages ahead to see if it gets more interesting. a beat.}

<B>__{gary jacking off}
<A>__{to soft core pay per view. we're close on gary's straining face, but we can hear the pleasured moans of the actresses as they go down on each other. nearing climax, he looks for something to come on. he can't find anything.}
<L>__{interior foyer night}
<A>__{his left hand cupped to hold the semen, he pads barefoot from the tv room to the downstairs bathroom. we hear water running as he washes his hands. then it shuts off. we hear a thunk. something hard was dropped on the wood floor. gary hears it too. he steps out of the bathroom, looks around. he takes a few silent paces back in our direction, stopping just before he reaches the two story section of the foyer. that's when he hears it: click click click click on the wooden floor. a jingle of metal. we follow gary's eyes up to the second floor walkway. we can hear the little footsteps, toe nails clicking. faint panting. but there's no dog. back on gary, increasingly unsettled. he's directly below the walkway, and can't see up into it.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{is somebody there? hello?}
<A>__{he claps his hands twice. listens. nothing. he's about to venture a step forward when suddenly}
