<B>__{on the sofa}
<A>__{she wipes the blood from his nose and lips. he looks in her eyes. she tries to stay on task, but she gets drawn in by his gaze. he leans forward. their lips almost touch. but this time, cris pulls back. liz is embarrassed.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{sorry to get you caught up in my soap opera.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{once you start watching, it's hard not to get involved.}

<A>__{cris looks at her with sympathy.}
<D>__{liz i can't either. have kids.}
<A>__{cris comforts her. she looks up into his eyes expectantly. fighting the pull, he looks away for a moment to see where this is going then glances back at her, almost dizzy.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{that was incredible. liz what was?}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{this.}
<A>__{he kisses her with a quiet intensity that quickly ignites. their lovemaking unfolds as it would be experienced by cris. effect before cause. the pleasure, then the gesture that elicits it. cris explores her body until she sighs, then snapsback and goes directly to the sweet spot. he strings together a perfect melody of shudders and moans, without striking any false notes along the way. moments are superimposed, diaphonous, played against each other in counterpointerior visual harmonics, elastically out of sync. rising to a crescendo. until all the futures resolve into a single now.}
