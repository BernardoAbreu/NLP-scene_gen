<A>__{lenny and iris come out the front door.}
<C>__{iris}
<D>__{it's a bad situation... if they get me i know they're going to oh shit!}
<A>__{she bridles like a startled horse. lenny looks at what she sees: a red beam, sweeping the parking lot. must be the cops. he turns back... she's gone. what the hell? he looks back at the red light... and edges around the corner to see what the cops are up to... it's not a cop car. it's a tow truck, with lenny's bmw on the hook. lenny runs to the tow driver, who looks like a biker only meaner.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{hang on, that's my car }
<C>__{tow driver}
<D>__{not anymore. belongs to the bank.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{hey wait a second...}
<A>__{ignoring him, the driver has started the hydraulic lift, and lenny makes the mistake of grabbing his beefy arm. the guy whips around, putting the muzzle of a .38 in lenny's face.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{oh, yeah, that's the answer! two million years of human evolution and that's the best idea you can come up with?}
<P>__{(driver continues with the hoist)}
<D>__{okay. look, whattya get to repo a car? two hundred? two fifty? i will pay you three fifty, right now. all you gotta do is drop it off the hook and say you came by, your mark wasn't here. simple. make a few bucks. do a good deed. huh?}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{you got the cash on you?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i was going to write you a check, if that's }
<A>__{the guy is getting into his truck.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{okay, okay, i totally respect that call. i would want cash. they'll take my check inside... i can see you're pressed for time, just give me two minutes... here keep my watch for collateral.}
<A>__{he hands the guy his watch.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{it's a rolex. be right back. two minutes.}
<A>__{lenny gets to the front door of the coral lounge, turns just in time to see the tow truck pulling out. lenny runs after his car, yelling, watching it recede.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{son of a bitch!}
<A>__{lenny walks back to the bar. he sets his haliburton up on the truck of a car and pops it open. he takes out a tiny digital cellular phone and dials a number. while it's ringing he takes another, identical rolex knock off out of the briefcase and slips it on.}
