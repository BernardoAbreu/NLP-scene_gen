<L>__{interior steilacoom dining hall day}
<A>__{everyone eating gruel. a parade of lunatics. the edge of incipient violence is palpable. frances eats listlessly. others are playing with their food, devouring it ravenously, fondling each other. suddenly a call starts up at the far end of the hall. other voices join in. at first we don't understand it, but gradually the words become clear:}
<C>__{chant}
<D>__{come and get it! come and get it! come and get it!}
<A>__{the whole hall joins in. the nurses make no effort to stop it. others at frances' table smile at her, try to push her to her feet. when they succeed, the hall breaks into applause and a new chaotic chant:}
<C>__{chant}
<D>__{we want frances! we want frances!}
<A>__{the chant is quickly silenced by hushing sounds. everyone is watching frances. she climbs up on her bench. her eyes are glazed, her face expressionless. this feels like some kind of automatic behavior. she takes an exaggerated posture and speaks in almost a whisper:}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{come and get it...}
<A>__{the hall breaks into riotous applause, catcalls, stomping. frances climbs down from her bench. that was the entire performance.}
