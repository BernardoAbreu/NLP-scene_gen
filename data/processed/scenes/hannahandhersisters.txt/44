<T>__{cut to:}
<D>__{dusty bought this huge house in southampton.}
<A>__{the opera audience is heard cheering, applauding, and sounding their "bravos." the clapping stops as the movie cuts to frederick's loft. it is day. lee, wearing a baggy plaid shirt and jeans, has opened the door for elliot and his client, wealthy rock star dusty frye.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(leading the way into the loft, gesturing)}
<D>__{lee, frederick...say hello to dusty frye.}
<A>__{lee closes the door behind the men and walks over to dusty.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(shaking dusty's hand)}
<D>__{hi, dusty.}
<C>__{dusty}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{lee chuckles as she looks at him; he is wearing sunglasses, a red imprinted t shirt, and a baggy coat. she turns and walks with frederick, elliot, and dusty farther into the loft, her hands clasped behind her back.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(as he walks)}
<D>__{dusty's just bought a huge house in southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.}
<C>__{dusty}
<D>__{yeah. it's kind of a weird place, actually. a lotta wall space.}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{they walk into the living room area of the loft, where frederick, his hands in his pockets, neatly attired in vest sweater and white shirt, stands, waiting.}
<C>__{dusty}
<P>__{(to frederick, giving him a "hip" handshake)}
<D>__{how ya doin', man?}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(to a less than enthusiastic frederick)}
<D>__{i told him about your work, and he's very excited.}
<C>__{dusty}
<D>__{yeah, i got an andy warhol. and i got a frank stella, too. oh, it's very beautiful.}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{big, weird...you know.}
<P>__{(chuckling as he}
<D>__{crosses his arms on}
<P>__{his chest)}
<D>__{if you stare at that stella too long, the colors just seem to float. it's kinda weird.}
<A>__{frederick covers his face to hide his disgust.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(chuckling, her arms crossed)}
<D>__{are you excited about becoming a collector?}
<C>__{dusty}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{dusty}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{i got a lot more to learn, though. i really wasn't into art when i was a kid.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{frederick}
<P>__{(addressing but not looking at dusty)}
<D>__{do you appreciate drawings?}
<C>__{dusty}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(chuckling as he}
<D>__{notices and points to some offscreen drawings frederick}
<P>__{has set up)}
<D>__{oh! hey! wow!}
<P>__{(pointing to an offscreen nude drawing)}
<D>__{she's beautiful. but, uh, really, i i i i need something... i'm looking for something big.}
<A>__{as dusty talks, the camera follows elliot, who walks past the others to examine the drawings more closely. two framed nude drawings of lee are propped up on an easel. elliot glances admiringly at the drawings, then surreptitiously at lee, admiring her body as she converses with an offscreen dusty and frederick.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(looking at an offscreen frederick, gesturing)}
<D>__{big. frederick, show him the oils.}
<C>__{frederick}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{they're in the basement.}
<A>__{the camera leaves elliot to follow the enthusiastic lee as she takes dusty by the arm and starts leading him to the door. frederick follows at a distance.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(to dusty)}
<D>__{frederick's done this whole new series that i'm sure you would really love.}
<C>__{dusty}
<P>__{(overlapping, muttering)}
<D>__{well, are...are they big?}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{yeah. some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.}
<C>__{dusty}
<D>__{'cause i got a lot of wall space there.}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<C>__{frederick}
<P>__{(angrily stopping in his tracks)}
<D>__{i don't sell my work by the yard!}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(chuckling, reacting)}
<D>__{oh, frederick!}
<A>__{the camera now moves back to elliot, still staring at the nude drawings, as the sounds of frederick's and dusty's footsteps are heard leaving the loft. he turns and hesitantly smiles to an offscreen lee.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(chuckling softly)}
<D>__{how's everything?}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(walking onscreen towards elliot)}
<D>__{oh, you know...i talked to hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(nodding, her arms clasped around her chest)}
<D>__{oh, yeah.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{but i go nuts. it's a conflict.}
<A>__{he laughs. lee, uneasy, looks down.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i have to get my teeth cleaned this week.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{oh, that's nice.}
<A>__{there's an awkward moment of silence.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(breaking the silence,}
<D>__{pointing in the}
<P>__{direction of the door)}
<D>__{i figured i'd get, uh, frederick and dusty together.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(looking in the same direction, gesturing)}
<D>__{oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{yes. this kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(nodding, wrapping}
<D>__{her arms around her}
<P>__{chest again)}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{he's got like six gold records.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(gesturing, relieved}
<D>__{that she's found}
<P>__{something to say)}
<D>__{oh, speaking of records...i bought that mozart trio you recommended...}
<A>__{the camera follows lee as she walks quickly to the stereo unit, pulling a record off the shelf.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...and the man in the record shop showed me another one that i think you'd love. it's a... another bach, second movement.}
<A>__{she pulls the record out of its jacket and puts it on the turntable.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{oh, you you have that one?}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(working at the}
<D>__{stereo, turning her}
<P>__{head towards elliot)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{oh, i would love to hear it.}
<A>__{bach's concerto for harpsichord fills the room.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(putting the turntable cover in place)}
<D>__{oh, and holly met a wonderful man who loves opera. an architect.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{oh, that's nice. i'd love to see her wind up settled. she's a tense one.}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<A>__{the record in place, lee turns and leans back against the stereo unit. she listens to the music, her eyes closed. the record plays for a few moments in the quiet room, as elliot walks over to lee and leans against the shelf near her.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(intently)}
<D>__{isn't that beautiful?}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(looking at lee, his}
<D>__{hands clasped in}
<P>__{front of him)}
<D>__{i know this. bach. f minor concerto. it's one of my favorites.}
<A>__{lee, smiling, continues to listen to the music, her head down; elliot stares at her.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(wrapping her arms}
<D>__{around her chest and looking away from}
<P>__{elliot for a moment)}
<D>__{yes, he's just adorable.}
<A>__{elliot nods.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(awkwardly)}
<D>__{they have a very large gay clientele, you know, where i get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of aids.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(taking a breath)}
<D>__{oh, right.}
<A>__{there is another moment of silence. elliot stares at lee, who continues to look down, her arms around her chest. the harpsichord plays on.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{yes, it made me cry}
<P>__{(tentatively looking at elliot)}
<D>__{it was so beautiful...so romantic.}
<A>__{lee looks down again; the music plays softly and elliot continues to stare at her, thinking.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{i want so badly to kiss her. not here, you idiot. you've got to get her alone someplace.}
<A>__{as elliot's thoughts are heard over the scene, lee glances around the loft, then begins to walk away. the camera follows her as she goes past the nude drawings, which become the focus of attention as lee walks offscreen.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{but i've got to proceed cautiously. this is a very delicate situation. okay, uh...ask her if you can see her for lunch or a drink tomorrow.}
<A>__{lee walks back onscreen, to the bookshelf behind the drawings. she takes the e.e. cummings book from the shelf and flips through it as she walks back to elliot, who is still leaning by the stereo, still ruminating.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{and be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive. this has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(showing elliot a poem in her book)}
<D>__{did you ever read this one ?}
<A>__{elliot leaps up, grabs lee, and kisses her passionately. lee, surprised, pushes him away.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{elliot! don't!}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{lee! lee! lee, i'm in love with you.}
<A>__{he kisses lee again. he clumsily turns around; she humps against the stereo unit. as lee pulls away, she smashes into the turntable. the needle scratches loudly. lee, shocked, is gasping. the record, pushed to a different part of the concerto, now plays a more complicated, faster fugue.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(breathing hard)}
<D>__{oh!}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(gasping)}
<D>__{what are you doing?!}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(frantically)}
<D>__{i...i'm i'm i'm i'm sorry. i have to talk to you for... there's so much that i want to tell you.}
<A>__{lee stares at elliot in shock.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(still gasping)}
<D>__{elliot!}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(gesturing desperately)}
<D>__{i have been in love with you for so long.}
<A>__{frederick and dusty's indistinct voices, raised in argument, are suddenly heard. elliot quickly turns away from lee. she tries to compose herself and the film cuts to the loft entranceway. frederick enters the loft first, followed by a confused dusty. they stride across the loft past lee, who is standing by the stereo. elliot, standing near the nude drawings, is looking through a book.}
<C>__{frederick}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{please forget it! i don't have any interest in selling anything!}
<C>__{dusty}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{i ask you if you have something with a little puce in it, you gotta fly off the handle!}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(in a slightly higher pitched voice)}
<D>__{what's the problem?}
<C>__{frederick}
<P>__{(pulling the nude}
<D>__{drawings off his}
<P>__{easel angrily)}
<D>__{i'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!}
<C>__{dusty}
<P>__{(overlapping, gesturing)}
<D>__{well, i can't commit to anything without consulting her first. that's what i have her for, okay?}
<C>__{frederick}
<P>__{(carrying the drawings off)}
<D>__{this is degrading! you don't buy paintings to blend in with the sofa!}
<C>__{dusty}
<P>__{(looking after frederick)}
<D>__{it's not a sofa, it's an ottoman!}
<P>__{(touching his forehead, turning to elliot)}
<D>__{god, forget it! let's just get outta here, elliot.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(putting down the book)}
<D>__{we'll go.}
<A>__{the film moves outside the loft building. dusty and elliot emerge and walk to dusty's waiting limousine. elliot is rubbing his forehead, anguished.}
<C>__{dusty}
<P>__{(angrily, getting into the car)}
<D>__{what a weirdo that guy is! paranoid.}
<P>__{(noticing elliot's anguished face)}
<D>__{what's the matter with you?}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{look i i i will be okay. i will be okay.}
<C>__{dusty}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{it's not that big a deal. we just didn't hit it off.}

<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{now, look, you you you go on ahead.}
<C>__{dusty}
<D>__{are you okay? you look you're sweatin'.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(overlapping, nervously)}
<D>__{yeah. yeah, i just just need so some some fresh air. it's probably something i ate. i will i will walk. you go ahead.}
<A>__{dusty settles down in the backseat and closes the door. elliot leans down to the chauffeur's window, signaling for him to start driving.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(continuing, gesturing)}
<D>__{you go. go on. go.}
<A>__{the limousine drives off. elliot runs to a phone booth across the street. he picks up the phone and dials. the film cuts to frederick in his loft, standing near the phone. it rings. frederick picks it up.}
<C>__{frederick}
<P>__{(into the telephone)}
<D>__{hello? hello? hello?}
<A>__{when no one answers, frederick, reacting, hangs up, and the film moves back outside to the phone booth, where elliot, the phone receiver to his ear, listens for a moment, then hangs up. he walks out of the booth, reacting, then walks down the sidewalk, where he bumps into a frantic lee, just turning the corner.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(gesturing in relief)}
<D>__{oh! there you are!}
<A>__{elliot mumbles, relieved and confused.}
<C>__{lee}

<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?}
<A>__{elliot, uneasy, glances up in the direction of frederick's loft. he leads lee a few yards up the street, away from any prying eyes.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(taking lee's arm)}
<D>__{wh , uh, i know, i know but, i am in love with you.}

<D>__{oh, no, no.}
