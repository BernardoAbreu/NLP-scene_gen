<L>__{exterior boulder field wide shot day}
<A>__{through the shimmering heat in the distance we see the strange sight of the three figures vaulting from boulder to boulder.}
<L>__{exterior boulder field rhonda's truck day}
<A>__{val, earl and rhonda pole vault their way toward the truck. finally they're at the nearest boulder, but the truck is still ten feet away.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{think it's still following us?}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{let's assume that it is.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{and once we hit that truck we gotta go fast. i say we all jump together.}
<A>__{rhonda and val nod. rhonda grips her car keys in her teeth.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<P>__{(through clenched teeth)}
<D>__{ready?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{yeah. one, two, three...}
<A>__{they all vault in unison, landing in the truck bed. rhonda scrambles up, slides open the cab's rear window, and begins wriggling through headfirst.}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{come on, girl, it ain't gonna give us much time...}
<A>__{dust explodes around the rear of the truck! hook tentacles snake up on all sides, narrowly missing val. he and earl grab whatever's handy, pounding at the tentacles with expensive instruments.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{go! go! go!}
<A>__{rhonda's only half way through the cab window, still hanging headfirst into the cab. she frantically starts the truck, dives down and punches the accelerator with her fist. as the truck roars away, one tentacles manages to tear off the the muffler. the engine thunders like a tank. val and earl sit back, sighing in relief, then react when they see rhonda is driving upside down and blind.}
