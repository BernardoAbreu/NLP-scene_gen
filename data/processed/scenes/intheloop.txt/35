<C>__{linton}
<D>__{i believe i've flagged everything i needed to discuss. as i usually do.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(putting her hand over her}
<D>__{mouth, mocking linton's}
<P>__{gesture from earlier)}
<D>__{or everything you're prepared to discuss.}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{what is that, karen}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i understand you've started up a new committee, what's it called?}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{what makes you think that?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{it was mentioned in our london meeting.}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{you must have misheard.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i misheard the word committee?}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{maybe it was another word. like khomeini.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you're sitting on a new khomeini?}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{possibly. there are a lot of words, karen. kansas city. kitty.}
<C>__{bob ariano}
<D>__{itty.}
<C>__{linton}

<C>__{chad}

<C>__{linton}
<D>__{thank you, james}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{chad.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{ok. why don't you just recap for me all the committees that you're currently sitting on?}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{i'm sorry, karen, you appear to be bleeding from your mouth.}
<A>__{she is. but she doesn't want to leave the meeting.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{oh don't try to change the subject linton.}
<C>__{liza}
<P>__{(looking at karen)}
<D>__{oh no. holy mother of....}
<A>__{everyone is just looking at her.}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{i don't mean to be rude karen but that is a tad... repulsive. i can't concentrate on what you're saying. you have blood coming out of your teeth and that's not right.}
<A>__{karen gets up to go. it's awkward, she's boxed in and has to clamber over the others to get to the door.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{okay, liza come with me.}
<C>__{chad}
<P>__{(aside, to liza)}
<D>__{go, buffy you belong to the vampire queen now.}
<A>__{liza follows karen out. chad takes liza's seat.}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{i don't like to see a woman bleeding from the mouth. it makes me think of country and western music. which i really can't abide.}
<C>__{chad}
<P>__{(what?)}
<D>__{yes! ha ha! exactly.}
<A>__{linton sees his chance to take advantage of karen being out of the room.}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{actually while we're on any other business i do have a few points i'd like to resolve.}
