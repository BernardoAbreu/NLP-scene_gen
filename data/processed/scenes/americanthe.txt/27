<A>__{jack turns casually down one of the town's many narrow alleyways. the alleyway way bends left and right in a series of blind corners and dark tunnels, the street enclosed by arches, criss crossed by flying stone buttresses and flanked by outside stairwells. it's a stalker's heaven or hell depending on how dangerous the prey. jack proceeds along the alleyway until he gets to a crossroads where four narrow alleyways converge. each alleyway leads uphill or downhill with varying degrees of steepness. jack photographs each alleyway. from an upstairs window he can hear the soundtrack of a game show on television. from another alleyway comes the sound of a barking dog. no dog is visible. curious, jack turns around, walking back the way he came. the sound of barking gets louder. on his right hand side, jack finds a hidden archway. the hidden archway resembles an archer's slit but is big enough for a gown man to slip through. unlike a window, the `slit' is actually just a crack in a triangular convergence of two separate and slightly overlapping ancient stone walls. the confluence of two stone surfaces makes the narrow gap between them very, very difficult to spot. jack slips though the hidden archway. inside is a courtyard.}
