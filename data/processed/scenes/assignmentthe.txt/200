<D>__{no it wasn't. he's finished. the kgb bought it. as far as they're concerned, he's the enemy now. he'll bounce around from one country to the nexterior but his paymasters have disowned him. none of their client states will risk using him. no one'll trust him again. he'll spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder waiting to be betrayed. and it'll happen... sooner or later... when it's to some country's advantage... they'll give him up or they'll trade him. he's finished. it worked and he's finished.}
