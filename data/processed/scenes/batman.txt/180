<L>__{exterior street that moment}
<A>__{the joker's van bursts out of the park and speeds up a wide, cordoned off avenue. overhead, the second copter veers wildly, out of the park now, swinging dangerously close to the tall buildings along the avenue.}

<A>__{dick grayson at the mouth of the bay, hanging on by a canvas strap. he watches helplessly as his mother swings into a power line and drops three stories to the pavement.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{no! noooooooo!!!!}
<A>__{his face is contorted with rage and pain. the pilot struggles desperately to right the copter, barely avoiding a collision with the nearest building. and then before the pilot can make a move to stop him dick has jumped}
<B>__{out of the copter. angle on dick}
<A>__{with astonishing physical grace, he dives. grabs a flagpole. executes a perfect somersault. flips onto a nearby fire escape. vaults to the next fire escape down. and leaps out over the street making a perfect two point landing on his intended target... the roof of the joker's van!!}
