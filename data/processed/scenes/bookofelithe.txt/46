<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{the town barely visible on the distant horizon behind eli and solara. eli walks as he always has, his pace steady and slow. still, solara lags along behind. she's already tired.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{where are we going?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i told you where i'm going. you're free to go wherever you want.}
<A>__{she stops in the road.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{wait... i'm not coming with you?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you're only going to slow me down.}
<A>__{eli doesn't stop walking. solara is forced to catch up.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{so what the hell was all that about back there?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{the man was hurting you. i don't like that, so i put a stop to it. now you're free. he can't hurt you any more.}
<P>__{(off her stare)}
<D>__{no need to thank me.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{thank you? for what? what am i supposed to do now?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{whatever you want. that's what being free is.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{whatever i want. except go with you.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i have to get where i'm going. i can't be worrying about someone else along the way.}
<A>__{solara is incredibly hurt by this. blinks back a tear.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{i thought you were my friend.}
<A>__{beat. eli stops and turns back to face her.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's dangerous in the outland. i wouldn't want you to get hurt.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{i will be safe so long as i'm with you. i know it.}
<A>__{eli sighs. he's not getting through to her. so now comes the harsh truth of it:}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you don't want this life. i gotta do what i gotta do. don't have no choice in it. but you do. and i can't let you choose this. you don't want to be like me. you don't want to spend your life alone.}
<A>__{solara steps closer, her eyes pleading.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{if i came with you, i wouldn't be alone. and neither would you.}
<A>__{a long beat as eli considers this. for a moment it appears as though solara might have won him over. but then:}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm sorry. look, maybe it's best you just go on back to town.}
<A>__{he turns and walks off, leaving her in the road. she stands there, furious, screaming at his back as he walks away.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{fine! i will do just that! i had a life there! a family! i didn't ask you to save me! i didn't ask you for anything!}
<A>__{he doesn't turn or acknowledge her at all. just keeps walking off into the horizon. getting smaller all the time. solara stands there in the road, weeping. all alone.}
<C>__{solara}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{she turns and walks back in the direction she came.}
