<L>__{interior mustang afternoon}
<A>__{we are looking down jenny's arm at a gas station just off interstate 169 in the minneapolis suburbs.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{gas...}
<A>__{the star man contemplates the station as they pass it, then turns to jenny, puzzled:}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{go.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{it's closed... closed. we need one that's open.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{closed?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you'll see.}
<A>__{there are no more gas stations in sight. the star man becomes bored with the silence. he picks up jenny's wallet. the driver's license is familiar so he flips to the next window. in it is a picture of an older man and woman standing in front of a church.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(snaps)}
<D>__{not what. who. what is for things.}
<P>__{(touching the steering}
<D>__{wheel, dashboard,}
<P>__{seat, gear shift)}
<D>__{what? what? what? what? for people you use who. who is he?}
<P>__{(points to the man in the picture)}
<D>__{who is she?}
<P>__{(points to the woman)}
<D>__{who are you?}
<P>__{(points to the star man)}
<D>__{who am i?}
<A>__{she touches her chest.}
<C>__{star man}
<P>__{(mirrors her gestures)}
<D>__{who is he? who is she? who are you? who am i?}
<P>__{(pause; it clicks for}
<D>__{him and he points at}
<P>__{jenny)}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i am jenny haydn.}
<C>__{star man}
<P>__{(flips back to her license and reads)}
<D>__{jennyhaydn.}
<A>__{jenny nods.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{i am...}
<A>__{we hear modulated clicks of his percussive language.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{that's a big help. where are you from?}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{from?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(leans forward and}
<D>__{points through the windshield at the}
<P>__{sky)}
<D>__{are you from up there? space?}
<C>__{star man}
<P>__{(leans forward to look with her)}
<D>__{space?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{up there... i... eh... can't explain...}
<P>__{(leans back)}
<D>__{but that's the only place you could be from.}
<A>__{the star man spots a station on the other side of the interstate.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{gas.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(shakes her head 'no')}
<D>__{closed.}
<A>__{he taps the fuel gauge which has dipped below empty.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{no gas.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{they both scan the horizon for a gas station. when one doesn't come up immediately, the star man flips to the next picture in the wallet. it is of the man he has become. he is leaning against a fire truck, in uniform.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{my... husband.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{i am husband?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{no. i don't know what you are, but you're not scott.}
<A>__{silence. the star man catches her mood. a tear rolls down jenny's cheek.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(brushes it away angrily)}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{shit?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{no, no... don't say that. bad word.}
<C>__{star man}
<P>__{(likes the sound of it)}
<D>__{shit... shit... what shit?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{stop!! enough!! jesus! you're worse than a parrot!!}
<A>__{like closing a zipper, she slides her fingers across her mouth.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{mouth closed... closed.}
<A>__{the star man does as he is told. he doesn't like it, but he does it. with his lips puckered, he looks straight down the road. the car rises out of a gulley. topping a knoll straight ahead is a gas station with an enormous exxon sign revolving above it. with his lips firmly pressed together, he tugs jenny's sleeve and points.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i see it.}
<A>__{the star man reaches forward and squeezes the satel compass back into his palms.}
