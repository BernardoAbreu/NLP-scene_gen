<L>__{interior hospital corridor night}
<A>__{the elevator doors open, and the orderly steps out. back to the bride she hears the sound of bill's boots approaching the room...}
<B>__{step...step...step...}
<A>__{she sees gerald has a trucker's knife in a holster attached to his belt. her hands removes it. the orderly swaggers down the hall to the bride's room, red reeboks slapping against the smooth floor. cu the bride she snaps the knife's blade open in her cu. the orderly pushes open the bride's door, stopping in shock. the orderly's pov: he sees an empty bed with bloodstains on it, two dead truckers on the floor, and no bride.}
<C>__{orderly}
<D>__{oh shit!}
<A>__{we go to slow motion as he freaks, then pan down him... past shirts pants to his reeboks...once on the floor we see the bride, curled up low next to the doorway, behind his ankles, knife ready. we go back to 24 frames a second. he steps into the room; when he does the bride reaches out and slashes both of his achilles tendons. the standing orderly lets out a "yelp," adn falls out of frame.}
<B>__{impact cut}
<A>__{the orderly hitting the floor face first. the boy is stunned. the bride (confined to the floor) crawls over and drags the stunned fucker across the floor, placing his melon head between the door and the door frame. then taking the door in her right hand.}
<D>__{slam! slam! slam!}
<B>__{slamming his head three times between the door and the door frame.}
<A>__{the orderly lies on the floor in a stange state of consciousness. he's in both excruciating pain, and quite sure he's lost his mind, since at this moment he's lying on the floor, looking up at the comatose bride asking him questions.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{where's bill?}
<C>__{the orderly}
<P>__{(hurt and confused)}
<D>__{who? slam!}
<A>__{he screams.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{bill! where is bill!}
<C>__{the orderly}
<D>__{i dunno no bill. slam!}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{i saw him here myself..... slam! ....now do you tell me where he is, or do i beat your fuckin brains in? slam!}
<C>__{the orderly}
<D>__{please please stop, don't hit me again!}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{where is bill? slam!}
<A>__{suddenly the bride sees the gold coke straw around his neck, that she thought she'd seen earlier on bill. she snatches it from around his neck.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{where did you get this from?}
<C>__{the orderly}
<D>__{that's mine. slam!}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{bullshit! i saw bill wearing it in this room ten minutes ago. slam!}
<A>__{then the bride looks down and sees two tatoos on the orderly's hand one spelling "b.u.c.k." on each finger of his left hand. and another spelling "f.u.c.k." on the fingers of his right. the bride seems to look inside her own mind whenever she does this a special theme music will play (we'll call it her remembering theme). we do a quick shaw brothers zoom into her eyes we see buck enter her room that first night, five years ago.... he's holding in his hand one of those big flashlights you use in a tent when camping. it gives off a soft blue light. buck examines the bride through the blue.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{well, ain't you the slice of cutie pie they all said you wuz. well ma'am, i'm from longview texas, my name's buck, and i'm here to fuck.}
<A>__{he starts to unbuckle his belt. we zoom out of her eyes into a cu. the remembering theme cuts off. she looks down at buck and says;}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{your name's buck, right? and you came to fuck, right?}
<A>__{a "how the fuck does she know look," crosses his face. the bride looks down at him....the vengeance theme begins playing loudly on the soundtrack, and the vein in her forehead becomes pronounced and begins to pulsate in time with the music. every time the bride comes face to face with a tormenter, this theme will play on the soundtrack. by mid movie this music should drive the audience wild with orgasmic anticipation of the carnage to come... ...and with the door in her hand and one mighty slam, this longview texas boy is sent to the promised land. she searches the dead man's pockets, coming up with a brown wallet that says on it, "big el paso pimpin," loaded with lettuce. she also pulls out a set of car keys on a pickup truck key chain that has the words, "pussy wagon" on it written in a pimpy font. she gathers up all these items, and gerald's knife, then begins to strip buck of his orderly uniform.}
