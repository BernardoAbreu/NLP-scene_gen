<A>__{lloyd's fantasy: lloyd is walking up the steps of a luxurious, snow covered chalet, carrying mary's briefcase. the sky is absurdly blue and children are making a snowman on the lawn. it's all out of a dream world. he knocks on the door, tentatively. mary opens it. she looks at him, then at the briefcase, and breaks into the biggest, sweetest smile he's ever seen. then she slowly backs into the house, gesturing for him to follow... lloyd follows mary down a hallway. as he trails after her, she pulls off her shirt, revealing her bare back, and glances over her shoulder at him. camera moves around a corner and now we're in a steamy bathroom. the shower is running and we see the silhouette of two people behind the curtain.}
