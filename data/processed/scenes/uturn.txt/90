<T>__{the sun comes up:}
<L>__{exterior canyon end spot dawn}
<A>__{in the vast reaches of a deserted canyon, where vultures circle in a hot white sky, we find the mustang parked at the edge of a drop. we hear the sound of a body being dragged.}
<C>__{d.j. }
<D>__{...nobody's sure where it was heading so fast but the way it hit the semi, it won't be getting home now! hey area weather is gonna be hot! hot! hot! then cold! cold! cold! just like yesterday. just like every day. some surprise, huh? so if you're planning on anything, don't . you don't like the weather, just wait one minute. got any brains, get up to alaska and get yourself some trailer park where you don't see no desert for miles and miles...}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{right there... drop it there. i got it.}
<A>__{bobby is giving grace instructions as they drop sheriff virgil potter's corpse over a drop onto some rocks 30 yards below.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{see ya, virgil. god bless.}
<A>__{bobby pushes him over, his hand hurting. the body crashes below. it's hard work. they head back for the mustang, to retrieve jake's body in the popped trunk. but grace notices bobby glancing at the baretta now tucked in her waist. the silence is tense between them, the rocks and gravel crunching under their shoes as they walk.}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{is this what's bothering you bobby?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no grace, my hand's bothering me.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you think now that jake's dead, there's all that money there and i don't need you anymore, and i might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!}
<A>__{she pulls an imaginary trigger on bobby, mimicking the recoil of a gun. bobby is nervous.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{don't you think i would've done it if i wanted to? what can i do to make you relax, baby?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you could give me my gun back.}
<A>__{grace smiles.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{why don't we just finish what we started.}
<A>__{she stares down at jake. she can't help feeling some old feelings. as bobby walks back to the front of the car, turns off the annoying radio. he watches as she softly prays over jake, whose face is concealed by the blanket in which he is rolled.}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{what do you think happens to someone's spirit when they die?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i think nothing happens. you're dead meat. that's it.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you don't believe in anything do you, bobby?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i believe in this moment, that's all. there is nothing else.}
<P>__{(lifting jake by the shoulder)}
<D>__{come on. he must weigh 300 pounds.}
<A>__{grace leans into the trunk to take his boots when he makes his move, quickly, closing on her when she's off guard. he slams her hard in the face, coldly sending her sprawling to the ground, dazed. he steps over her and grabs the gun in her waist, checks it. she puts her hand to her mouth, feels the blood on her finger tips. she looks at him and laughs a wild crazed laugh that cuts into bobby like a knife.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you hit me, bobby? you hit a woman, you motherfucker! didn't your momma ever teach you anything...?}
<A>__{her eyes go to the gun in his hand and she stops laughing. her calm is extraordinary, as if expecting to die.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{well?}
<A>__{for a moment, bobby does nothing, then he slips the gun through his belt.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{well, nothing. we dump jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{don't leave me. i want to say with you, bobby.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{why? so when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i was just baiting him! bobby, i had to tell him that to get his guard down. just like you told jake you was going to kill me!}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you lied to me all along! lies, all lies. your mother, your father, what story are you on now? how come the town didn't know you was his daughter?}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{cause my mom slept around. a lotta men! anybody could've been my father. but we knew .}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{well you got what you wanted all along by fucking me. i wish you had told me the goddamn truth in the first place!}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{i didn't want you to know! don't you... unnerstand?}
<A>__{bobby's got a headache now. it's too much to understand, too much talk. too much history has taught him to doubt.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{when you're finished with me, i'm next! i been there, baby. i been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. i will take you as far as california. if we can make that. after that you're on your own. try mexico. with all this bread, you can live like a queen.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i don't want to go to mexico, bobby! please, i really want to be with you. don't blow this. don't you think i care about you?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i think you're a lying, back stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. but it's nice to know you cared...}
<A>__{the expression on grace's face changes as rapidly as the desert weather, a coldness passing over and through her.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you don't know your own mind. it blocks your heart.}
<A>__{keeping a wary eye on grace, bobby starts hauling jake out of the trunk.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{give me a hand.}
<A>__{he wrestles jake up to a sitting position. he grabs a can of beer from a warm six pack in the trunk and shoves it into a pocket of jake's coat.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{poor old jake, a few drinks, a fight with the sheriff over his wife. and both of 'em ended up dead.}
<A>__{grace takes his boots.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{time to go for a walk, jake.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{my mother died in this canyon.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{save the mom routine, will ya grace. it doesn't work with me. one, two, three...}
<A>__{they lift the corpse, and with great effort, haul it towards the edge of the drop. as they pause on the way, bobby, wary of grace's strange coldness, tries to soften the blow of separation.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{look, it's not so bad we split up. it might be months before they find these guys. if at all. i mean with the mountain lions around here. remember, if they can't find no bodies, there's no crime... (she doesn't respond.) we'll be in phoenix by noon. lose this car, get another one. texas, mexico are big countries, all that money grace, you'll meet someone else, you know, there's a lot of hope with a $100,000...}
<A>__{they lift jake again, and move to the edge.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{hope is a four letter word.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{but we all need that too. hold him.}
<A>__{he props jake at the edge, standing, and transfers the weight onto grace. jake's head is on her shoulder.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you make a pretty couple.}
<A>__{it seems he might push them both over but instead takes the gun, wipes it of his prints, and slips it through jake's belt.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{won this in a poker game in reno. god knows who it's registered to. you shoulda been more careful, jake. see you later.}
<A>__{as he takes jake's weight off grace and pushes it over the drop. grace watches him go, her eyes shifting to bobby, his back momentarily to her, also watching. she moves towards him. bobby turns, slips on the edge.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{now all we got to do is try and }
<A>__{he feels a blur of motion, almost like a bird, and he is falling...falling, his life coming to an end. grace is standing somewhere up above, briefly seen. did she push him? he doesn't know. he's stunned as he falls on the rocks next to the bodies of jake and virgil. he screams out in sharp pain. his leg feels broken. but he is alive. grace walks away, cutting it all off, deeply shaken. she must get away from the past and all these hollow men. she closes the trunk of the mustang, gets in the driver's seat, reaches for the ignition key. her hand fumbles for it a moment. it isn't there.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{she sits there. bobby is calling from below.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{grace! help me, grace...! we been through too much together. we've only had one day, but you and me have been through more than most people ever will. i know you were angry at me, and, you know, you were right! i'm sorry i hit you. i was wrong about leaving you. you don't belong in mexico.}
<A>__{she finally gets out and walks back to the edge of the cliff, looks down.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{thank you. thank you. i...i knew you wouldn't leave me, grace.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{bobby? are you all right?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i busted my leg!}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{can you make it back up?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{grace in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. it should reach down here. go get it, throw it down.}
<A>__{she looks. of course the trunk is closed. she closed it.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{bobby, the trunk...it's locked. throw the keys up to me. i will get the rope.}
<A>__{bobby's eyes pass over jake a few feet away, his eyes staring upwards in death. they take in the gun still attached to his waist. he knows the trunk wasn't locked when they took jake out.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i can't throw that far. you got to climb down here and get the keys. you can make it. it's the only way grace.}
<A>__{grace looks down at the drop. it's a tough descent but she knows she could make it and get back up as well.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{grace!...please, grace! you have to help me.}
<A>__{grace takes a look around.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{okay. i'm coming. calm down!}
<A>__{she starts down the cliff face. as she descends, he talks deliriously.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{i knew you'd help me. i knew you wouldn't leave me baby, cause we're tied together too close. we belong together always.}
<A>__{grace makes it to the bottom of the drop, and walks cautiously towards bobby.}
<P>__{grace (yelling back, echoing)}
<D>__{bobby! don't flip out on me. i can't do this alone. i know you don't trust me, but you gotta pull yourself together, i'm not gonna leave you...i never wanted it to go down like this. it was different with you bobby. you had dreams like me. you listened... i would've gone anywhere with you, bobby. we can make this work. i'm sorry...i really am. i didn't wanna hurt you.}
<A>__{can he believe her? she sounds so sincere this time. she's heading for the body of jake. and the gun. bobby knows that and is already crawling there.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{they're right here, grace. the keys. come get me out of here... know why else i could never leave you?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{why's that?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{'cause i love you.}
<A>__{inching closer. closer. they meet at the apex of jake's corpse.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{and i love you too.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{and love's a funny thing. sometimes i don't know if i want to love you...}
<A>__{grace leans close to bobby. he dangles the keys out in front of her, but she doesn't reach for them. her eyes go to bobby. she reaches for him. at that instant bobby's hands shoot out and clamp hard around her. a sharp gurgle is all that escapes grace as bobby twists the life from her, as jake leers up at them.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{... or kill you .}
<A>__{grace twists and flails in bobby's hands, but in spite of his bleeding stump, he holds her like a bear trap holds a grizzly.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i love you grace, but i just can't trust you !}
<A>__{she looks at him, trying to protest, shaking her head. grace's flailing goes into overdrive. somewhere in his semi delirious state, bobby's eyes might notice the gun at jake's waist is no longer there. grace manages one word:}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{jake ...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{he can't help you now, honey!}
<A>__{bobby is in agony as he kills her, part beast, part lover, he kills that which he loves. suddenly, a shot is heard. bobby buckles with the blast, hit in the side. he kills her with one last wrenching thrust of his hands, breaking her neck. bobby looks down at jake's gun, which she clutches in her hand, and sees the hole in his side and the river of blood that flows from it. he manages to stand, looks at jake; their bodies lying side by side. bobby, with great difficulty, claws his way back up the rocks to the car, his fast flowing wound staining the white rocks with blood. he makes it to the top and, losing more blood, climbs into the driver's seat. he checks the money in the bag. all there. all his. as he pulls a huge clot of blood from his side, the vultures circle. perhaps one, smarter than the others, lands close by. it spooks bobby but he's okay. he looks in the mirror.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you're still lucky.}
<A>__{he puts the key in the ignition, the engine comes to life.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{adios }
<A>__{suddenly, the radiator hose darrell installed blows apart loudly. bobby knows exactly and immediately what it is as a cloud of steam now rolls from under his hood. he shakes his head, frustrated.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{oh shit!...(then) arizona.}
<A>__{he can't help but laugh at his bad luck. as we rise off the desert floor and take flight with the vultures, eventually leaving them all as specks of earth in the vast empty canyons of arizona.}
<C>__{the end}
