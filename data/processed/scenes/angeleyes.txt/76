<L>__{exterior street night (later that night)}
<A>__{sharon and robby are still on the job, their unit rolling down a residential street of apartment buildings. a parked car is blasting music, and robby halts beside it. sharon starts making dancing moves to the music, sitting there beside robby, and he stares at her as she grooves, kidding it. then robby hits the horn to get the driver's attention in the parked car. robby makes a gesture to lower the volume, and the man snaps off his tape. robby rolls on, glancing at sharon. she wears a small smile, checking their beat.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{what's going on, pogo? you're not happy or anything?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{well, it's a mix, robby. life is shit, but i'm dating this great dead guy.}
<A>__{she smiles at robby's look.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{he says before i came along, he thought he was dead. sounds better when he says it }

<D>__{listen.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{shhh. sh!}
<A>__{robby stops the unit, rolling the windows down. they hear the faraway sound of...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{the trumpet player.}
<A>__{robby pulls over.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{this time we got his ass.}
<A>__{they exit the car and stand in the street, looking up, scanning the dark buildings but the sound is hard to track, a faint ballad on a skillful horn.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{wow.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{got 'im?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{look at that moon.}
<A>__{they stare at the full moon. in a moment, we hear the sound of roaring cars, their tires screeching as they turn onto this street, one car speeding ahead to cut off the other and force it to stop. the two male drivers are screaming at each other. robby shakes his head.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{full moon, man. hey!}
<A>__{they run toward the drivers who are exiting their cars to confront each other. one big guy carries a baseball bat. robby heads off one driver while sharon intercepts the bat man.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{this guy's crazy! bat man this asshole side swiped me!}
<C>__{sharon}

<A>__{the man hesitates, then moves toward his trunk.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{i never touched his car. bat man you lying bastard!}
<A>__{the man charges, bat in hand, and sharon makes a flying tackle, bringing him down hard on the street and we immediately...}
