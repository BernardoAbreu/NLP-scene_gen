<L>__{exterior house of bliss another angle day}
<A>__{the camera makes a slow circuit around the continental, taking in an aerial protruding from the trunk, and below it a license plate with the word "typhon" on it. the move continues, briefly scanning a driver with a nasty recidivist face, seated behind the wheel, and as we come full circle, the passenger door opens and harry gets out. he slams the door and steps back, angrily glaring at the car. the hydraulic window opens and moncrief looks out at him:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you're talking to the wrong godammed party, you know that?}
<C>__{moncrief}
<D>__{i think it's in your best interest to hear me out.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no, you hear me out, friend...}
<A>__{he takes note of the driver (sturge) coming around the front of the car. he stops a few feet off and unbuttons his jacket, revealing the cross strap of a shoulder holster. harry steps over to the window, leans down and communicates in more politic tones:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{look, i happen to have a very high regard for this party. and maybe i even have some feelings of a personal nature here.}
<C>__{moncrief}
<D>__{well i don't want to appear to be taking unfair advantage of you...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{goddamned right.}
<A>__{moncrief reaches into a briefcase, takes out a folder and makes reference to its contents as he speaks:}
<C>__{moncrief}
<D>__{but in developing certain information on you, it's come to our attention that your name isn't harry bliss. that in fact, your name is eugene earl axline...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{wait a minute.}
<C>__{moncrief}
<D>__{and that both the i.r.s., and an impressive number of creditors in several eastern cities...}
<P>__{(looks up at harry)}
<D>__{... seem to be somewhat interested in your whereabouts.}
<A>__{harry stands up, leaving the vulnerable area of his stomach framed in the passenger window. when he leans back down, a deeply conflicted expression is apparent on his face:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you know, that's not necessarily entirely accurate, i mean, i don't know where you come up with these so called facts, but...}
<P>__{(at a loss,}
<D>__{he looks off, shaking}
<P>__{his head)}
<D>__{i can't go sneaking around, stealing this lady's property.}
<C>__{moncrief}
<D>__{i'd like to pose that the name and reputation of this very decent man, is not the property of mrs. ellerman, or her sister.}
<A>__{he takes a voucher from the folder and sets the file aside:}
<C>__{moncrief}
<D>__{and it's my hope that we can avoid any unpleasant eventualities, either for you, or for someone you have such admirable feelings toward...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what do you mean, 'unpleasant'?}
<C>__{moncrief}
<D>__{i mean that mr. layls is prepared to do whatever it takes to confiscate this document. and if you'd like to be of some assistance to us, by finding it and turning it over to me, he'd like to offer you this very generous gift.}
<A>__{he holds the voucher out to harry who avoids looking at it:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{jesus christ, i hardly know the woman. i'm just renting a dog to her, that's all.}
<P>__{(looking at moncrief)}
<D>__{what kind of a person do you take me for?}
<A>__{harry stands in the parking lot, watching as the con tinental drives off. he starts to move toward the house of bliss, then stops and opens the voucher, braving a look at it.}
<B>__{closeup of typhon corporation check}
<A>__{signed by l.n. moncrief and made out to the sum of $15,000.}
