<L>__{exterior inverness station day}
<A>__{the highland express is pulling out of the station. as the last car disappears, and the steam clears from the tracks, we see holmes, gabrielle and watson on the platform. a baggageman is loading their luggage on a hand cart, under watson's supervision.}

<A>__{gabrielle looks at holmes. camera pans up toward an iron footbridge, spanning the railway tracks. moving across it in single file are the seven cowled trappist monks, with von tirpitz in the lead.}
