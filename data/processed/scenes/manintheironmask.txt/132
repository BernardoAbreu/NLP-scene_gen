<L>__{exterior paris streets night}
<A>__{squads of young musketeers gallop along the river, and through the dark streets around it, searching... along the back wall of notre dame cathedral, three forms scurry through the darkness: aramis, porthos and athos, heaving, wheezing. they duck into a niche of the wall to avoid capture from another patrol galloping by. then aramis unlocks a door in the cathedral wall and they stagger in.}
<L>__{interior catacombs}
<A>__{the three musketeers struggle through the catacombs, reach the chapel, and fall gasping to the floor.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{bloody hell...}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{we can't... stay here. that traitor d'artagnan... knows about this place.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{can we eat... before we go? this excitement's given me an appetite.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{bread and wine... in that cupboard.}
<A>__{porthos hauls himself to his feet and turns up the wick of the lantern. the rising light reveals a note, stuck to the cupboard with the blade of a dagger.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{a note. pinned with a dagger, like the old days.}
<A>__{he removes the note, and reads...}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{"phillippe has been removed to the bastille, to the lower dungeon. at midnight tonight i will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes. that should give you ample time. never have i needed more to say: one for all, and all for one. d'artagnan."}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{he lures us to capture.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{he seeks redemption.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{you're a fool!}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{perhaps. but of d'artagnan i am certain. what he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do be faithful to his king.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{so what has changed?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{perhaps he serves a different king.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{what choice is there? if phillippe is in the bastille, then to the bastille we will go.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{you are right. but it is a trap.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{so what? i'd rather die covered in blood, than an old man, lying in my own piss.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{then to the bastille.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{to the bastille. and death.}
