<A>__{frank, gibson and the con ed men scramble towards the manhole. butch and another fireman are waiting up top. they help the men who are covered in oil and slime up onto the street. and then they all tear away from the manhole...around a corner... collapsing on the pavement against a building. k a b o o m a muffled explosion the vault ignites, the tunnel "flashbacks" a towering geyser of flames and dirt erupting out of the manhole from which frank has just escaped. in the distance, flames erupt out of the other manhole...engulfing the oil truck...blowing it into a million pieces. through the inferno at the base of the manhattan bridge, frank can see that no one is hurt. his eyes glistening with adrenaline and relief, he sits back against the building and throws an arm around gibson.}
