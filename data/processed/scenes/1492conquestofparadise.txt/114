<A>__{a wide, high shot of the new "city", dominated by a huge wooden cross no more than a muddy main street bordered by a hundred bamboo and stone shanties, with candles burning in the doorways. a main square with the governor's mansion, and the foundations of a church. in the twilight, columbus and the other workers returning, dirty and tired.}
