<L>__{interior the house second floor hallway night}
<A>__{peter backs into the hallway, breathing hard. then a familiar sound reaches our ears: thud. thud. thud. it's coming from toshio's room. and it's the same rhythmic thudding we've heard coming from this room before. peter wrenches his gaze from the horrific sight and heads quickly down the hall (with karen following him):}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{toshio! we have to }
<A>__{he stops short at the door, as he sees takeo, toshio's father. eyes rolled back in his head, tongue swollen and lolling from his blue lips. he's dead he's hanging from the ceiling by black hair that seems to cover its entire surface. kayako's hair. toshio, now back to his "dead" appearance, playfully swings the body. takeo's feet thud rhythmically against the wall.}

<D>__{oh my god...}
