<B>__{the bed.}
<A>__{starling approaches the bed, and looks down at the figure in it. we see her face, but the figure is screened. the figure, verger , speaks breath by breath, with an obvious}

<D>__{well, now, you see, one of them's hurt. and what will make it better? love. isn't that odd.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{he think's he's hurt his knee but the assurance, the assurance, the assurance that someone cares}
<A>__{(wheeze wheeze)}
<D>__{suggests the hurt was elsewhere .}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{mr. verger, thank you for your time.}
<C>__{verger}
<D>__{for the worst hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.}

<D>__{ah, yes, ah yes. our doctor lechter... and have they sent you, once again to capture him? how terrible for you...}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{no, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?}
<C>__{verger}
<D>__{because we must leave the past in the}

<B>__{cordell turns the page quickly.}
<C>__{verger }
<D>__{no, no. that's alright. yes. lechter's drawings of me. before ... and, of course, after ... now: you are not sent to pursue him. then your visit baffles me.}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{sir, various drawings, done by dr. lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction. several large reserve bids have been placed on them. i have to ask if you've placed those bids.}
<C>__{verger}
<D>__{because?}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was dr. lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.}
<C>__{verger}
<D>__{and why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived. and because you have large resources.}
<C>__{verger}
<D>__{large resources, starling, which i prefer to devote elsewhere....}
<A>__{starling looks up, as we see the image on the television change to the children eating the cookies, and the image changes again to show a small dispensary, and the knee of the}

<C>__{verger}
<D>__{yes, but we know who it was, and i will tell you, agent starling, what you know to be true. i offered the bounty. it was illegal, and, worse, it was wrong . and i thank god every day that i did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder. do you (wheeze) agent starling: do you know god ?}

<C>__{starling}
<D>__{...sir...?}
<C>__{verger}
