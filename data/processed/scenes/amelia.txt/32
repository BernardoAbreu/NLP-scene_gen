<A>__{back to amelia with bill's bottle, as the battered plane lurches every which way in the storm. she lifts it from the toolbox. hides it in the camera bag, as suddenly the plane drops fifty feet, and amelia is slammed against the ceiling, then crashes back to the floor. dazed, she sees bill turned around...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{hold onto something for chrissake!}
<A>__{she grabs the leg of the navigation table which has been bolted down. stares out the window, wondering if she'll make it.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{dearest dad. hooray for the last grand adventure. i wish i had won, but it was worthwhile anyway. you know that. i have no faith we'll meet anywhere again, but i wish we might.}
<A>__{hold on the gray eyes. dissolve to: later. amelia at the window, still opaque with fog. suddenly, the plane swoops down toward a clearing in the clouds. there to the south, a freighter running across our path. no land in sight. amelia scrawls a note, ties it to an orange from her flight bag, and crawls back to the boys.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{how far to land?}
<A>__{the boys are studying the freighter.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{radio's still out. no way to compute windspeed and drift in the fog, so god only knows where ireland is.}
<A>__{checks his watch.}
<P>__{bill (cont’d)}
<D>__{nineteen hours plus. we've got maybe an hour of petrol left. probably less.}
<A>__{she shows him the note and the orange.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{western union, special delivery.}
<A>__{bill has to smile. are you serious? as a heart attack. okay, he tries to get closer to the ship, but we're jerked and buffeted as we swing past and amelia... ...drops the orange toward the freighter, watching the heavy winds carry it two hundred yards wide of the mark. our three stare grimly.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{if we land near them, we've got a rescue.}
<A>__{their eyes are locked.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{think those ridiculous skis could hold us up in this kind of sea?}
<A>__{she's been wondering the same.}
<P>__{bill (cont’d)}
<D>__{you said we were going to make it. are you a liar?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{not on this occasion.}
<A>__{a rare smile...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well, then.}
<A>__{and swoops back on course. amelia's hand squeezes his shoulder.}
