<A>__{in the corridor, jay looks around. no tony, no answer to the bell. he dings once more, then heads into the back.}
<L>__{interior morgue day}
<A>__{jay comes into the morgue. laurel is in there, standing right up next to an examination table, but there is no corpse on the table, just a sheet draped over it. she just stands there, in the middle of the room, staring at jay.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{uh, hi.}
<C>__{laurel}
<P>__{(oddly)}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(flashes a badge)}
<D>__{i'm sergeant friday, from the twenty sixth precinct. they brought a cat in here with a corpse the other day, might have said "orion" on the cat's name tag?}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{yes. that's right.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{right, well, the cat is, uh the cat's a witness in a murder case and i'm going to need to take it with me.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{i don't know where the cat is at the moment.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you don't?}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(lowers her voice to a whisper)}
<D>__{maybe you could take me with you instead.}
<A>__{jay looks at her.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{i said, maybe you could take me with you instead.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{damn, you do start fast, don't you?}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{i'd really like to go with you. now.}
<A>__{jay just looks at her, amazed at the power he seems to have over this woman. he looks over his shoulder, to make sure he has a few more seconds alone.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{and, uh, why exactly is that?}
<A>__{laurel rolls her eyes. she seems irritated with him, but it doesn't go with what she's saying.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{i just do.}
