<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior barrack "h" day}
<A>__{the camera moves backward down the aisle between the bunks as helmut walks dejectedly down the aisle, nervously fingering his white ascot. the barrack is empty except for keltner, who is arranging the sprouts of his potato plant over a little trellis of sticks. helmut turns and walks back up the aisle to stand in front of keltner.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{i can't go out there. i can't take another day of them staring at me.}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{they'll get over it. disappointment is no stranger to those children.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{they look at me as though it was all my fault. haven't they been told why i can't...}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{i'm sure they have.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{then why do they stare?}
<C>__{keltner}
<P>__{(holding up the plant)}
<D>__{it's amazing how a thing like this can feed off itself. think how lucky we would be if we could do that.}
<A>__{helmut glances disinterestedly at the plant as he reaches up to his bunk and brings down the coat belonging to franz. he holds coat up for keltner to see.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{i sewed a button on. look all right?}
<C>__{keltner}
<P>__{(inspecting coat)}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{helmut gently pats the coat, then folds it and puts it back on his bunk.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{i did make them laugh. didn't i?}
<A>__{keltner nods.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{i wish they'd get them out of here. prison is no place for little children.}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{we've been all over that before. you've got to stop thinking about them.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(trying to convince himself)}
<D>__{you're right! i've got to think of myself.}
<A>__{keltner puts the plant under his bunk and gets up.}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{it's too hot in here. i'm going to get some air.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{johann... do you think there's any possible way i could talk to the commandant. maybe i could make him understand...}
<A>__{the sentence trails off as helmut realizes how useless his suggestion is.}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{there's nothing you can do... but forget.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{how can i! they were my own very special audience. and now they stare at me as if i had betrayed them.}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{they're children, helmut. you can't expect them to understand the madness of adults.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(sudden thought)}
<D>__{if i could talk to them. to the children themselves that would help, wouldn't it?}
<A>__{keltner doesn't answer but he watches helmut with new interest.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{if i explain it to them then they'll know i am not mad at them.}
<C>__{keltner}
<P>__{(very deliberately)}
<D>__{you go near that fence once again... and you're taking your life in your own hands. you know that as well as i do.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(pleading)}
<D>__{i would just need a minute. a minute to talk to them.}
<A>__{helmut goes to the door and looks out.}
