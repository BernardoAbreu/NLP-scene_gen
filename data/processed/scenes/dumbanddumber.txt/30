<A>__{the door opens and lloyd enters. harry is sitting on the couch, looking almost comatose.}

<D>__{where's the booze?}

<D>__{come on, man, cheer up. we've been own before. i'm sure we'll land on our heads somewhere.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it gets worse, lloyd. my parakeet petey he's... he's dead.}
<A>__{lloyd looks touched by this.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{oh man, i'm sorry, harry. what happened?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{his head fell off.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{his head fell off?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, he was pretty old.}
<A>__{lloyd puts his hand on harry's shoulder compassionately.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(hopeful)}
<D>__{i don't suppose he had a warranty...?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{nah, i bought him used.}
<A>__{as lloyd thinks about the unfairness of life, he grows upset.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{that's it! i've had it with this ump! we don't have food, we don't have jobs, our pets' heads are falling off, we're surrounded by roving gangs of larcenous old}
<B>__{ladies...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{okay, calm down.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{no i won't calm down.}
<A>__{lloyd flops down in a chair.}
<C>__{lloyd }
<D>__{what the hell are we doing here anyway, harry? we've got to get out of this town.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, and go where?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{i will tell you where: someplace warm, a place where the beer flows like wine, where beautiful women instinctively flock like the salmon of capistrano.}
<P>__{(dramatic pause)}
<D>__{i'm talking about aspen.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{aspen?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{that's right, aspen.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i don't know, lloyd, the french are assholes.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{let me ask you something: do you want to end up like petey dead in some flea ridden apartment, face down on a dear abby column, with a soggy sunflower seed pressed against your beak? or do you want to enjoy your life?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{come on, harry, don't let petey's eath be in vain. don't you see what he was saying? spread your wings, man. he was saying? spread your wings, man. fly.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{what are you talking about, lloyd? his head fell off.}
<P>__{(dawning realization)}
<D>__{wait a second, i know what you're up to. you just wanna go to aspen so you can find that girl who lost her briefcase and you need me to drive you there.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{that's bullshit. i will drive.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and what's so wrong about going someplace where we know someone who can plug us into the social pipeline?}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(torn)}
<D>__{i don't know, lloyd. i think we should stay here, hunt for jobs, and keep saving money for the worm store. i'm getting a little sick and tired of always running from creditors.}
<A>__{lloyd moves to the window and looks out at the gray, wintry cityscape.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{you know what i'm sick and tired of, harry? i'm sick and tired of having to eek my way through life. i'm sick and tired of being a nobody.}
<C>__{lloyd }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but most of all, i'm sick and tired of having nobody.}
<A>__{there's a deadly silence as they both think about this. then harry tries to lighten the mood. he opens his arms wide.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{come on, lloyd. give us a kiss.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{on the other hand, maybe you're right, harry. maybe we should stay here and try our luck in bankruptcy court. with all those lawsuits against us, i'm sure we'll win at least one. it could be a boost to our egos.}
<A>__{harry sees that lloyd has a pointerior he stands and approaches petey's cage. his eyes fill with tears.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(emotional)}
<D>__{petey, i made a promise to you once, man...}
<P>__{(thinking hard)}
<D>__{...and i will be damned if i can remember what it was.}
