<A>__{desert is served. jackets are off, cigars are lit, bretton's wife has gone home. the group at the table is a little drunk and having a good time.}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{it's a good question... what do you think, george?}
<A>__{george, an investment banker at the table, thinks about it.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{the definition of rich... flying private.}
<A>__{the table reacts... some agree, other don't. george turns to jacob.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{jacob... ? what do you think?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{to be rich... is to have the love of a good woman.}
<A>__{they all boo...}
<C>__{jacob }
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{for real... i truly believe that.}
<A>__{and jacob turns to bretton...}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{bretton... what's your definition of rich?}
<A>__{an approaching voice answers it for him.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{to have twice as much money as you currently do.}
<A>__{as he takes a seat...}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{isn't that what you always say, bretton?}
<A>__{then... announcing to the table...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{he brings up the question, runs it round the table then finishes with that. it's an old bit.}
<A>__{also announcing to the table...}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{be careful gordon...}
<P>__{(looking at jacob)}
<D>__{... your daughter's financial health is in my hands now.}
<A>__{jacob loses his smile... suddenly becoming uncomfortable.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{that's right.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and the way the locust fund has been buying up the insurance companies lately makes me worried about my future grandchildren's college educations.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(to bretton)}
<D>__{i didn't tell him.}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{no, i don't suppose you did.}
<A>__{bretton looks over to jacob.}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{go ahead, jacob, preach your book... defend your names.}
<A>__{and jacob turns to gordon...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{we have a proactive central bank, the charts show a clear bottom on july 15th and these companies are trading at half of what they were six months ago.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{just cause it's low don't make it cheap, sport.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i read your book.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{it's not out yet.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i have a friend in publishing.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<A>__{% unemployment... stagflation...}
<D>__{bread lines... martial law... government seizures of assets and gold... end of democracy...}
<A>__{bretton leans back... taking in this sparring match.}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{really gordon? do you really need attention that badly?}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{since i have forty four seconds to spare, i'm going to tell you a story. it's about a guy named sam.}
<A>__{and we go close on gekko...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{sam used to work a job, he made things and he grew things and he sold those things. until one day sam got a credit card and was amazed how easy it was to buy things with it. so sam got another card and then another. then he used the credit card money to make it look like he had an income... and he used that "income" to secure a loan.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{and with that loan sam bought a fancy bmw car and rented a fancy penthouse apartment.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now, the credit cards hit their limit and the bank needed him to service that loan, so sam went to his friends. his chinese friend... and his japanese friend... and his british friend and so on. and his friends loaned sam money.}
<P>__{(another beat)}
<D>__{and that brings us to today... where sam owes the credit cards and sam owes the banks and sam owes his friends and eventually they're going to take away sam's fancy bmw car and his fancy penthouse apartment.}
<A>__{and jacob can now see... in gordon gekko's eyes... he truly believes every word he's saying.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{and sam doesn't make anything anymore and sam doesn't grow anything anymore so sam doesn't sell anything anymore.}
<A>__{as he stands...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{our favorite uncle sam's desperate, jake... and he just found a printing press in his basement.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so you tell me where do we go from here?}
<A>__{and with that, gordon gekko goes.}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<P>__{(re gekko)}
<D>__{it is sad isn't it? that he can't just take his ball and go home.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that he has to piss on the whole game.}
