<A>__{a half dozen haggard cabbies hang around the office. their shirts are wrinkle, their heads dropping, the mouths incessantly chattering. we pick up snatches of cabbie small talk:}
<D>__{1st cabbie ... hadda piss like a bull steer, so i pull over on 10th ave, yank up the hood and do the engine job.}

<A>__{travis hands his trip sheet to a cab official, nods slightly, turns and walks toward the door. outside, travis walks pleasantly down broadway, his hands in his jacket pockets. the sidewalks are deserted, except for diligent fruit and vegetable vendors setting up their stalls. he takes a deep breath of fresh air, pulls a white pill from his pocket, pops it into his mouth. travis turns a corner, keeps walking. ahead of him is a 24 hour porno theatre. the theatre, a blaze of cheap day glow reds and yellows, is an offense to the clear, crisp morning air. the permanent lettering reads, "adam theatre, 16mm sound features". underneath, today's feature are hand lettered: "six day cruise" and "beaver dam". travis stops at the box office, purchases a ticket, and walks in.}
