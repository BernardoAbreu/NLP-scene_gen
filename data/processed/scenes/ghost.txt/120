<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{willie, blinded by his own hysteria, runs wildly into the street. cars are bearing down on him from all directions. he does not get out of their way. one driver sees willie coming and swerves to avoid him. his car skids. another car brakes to avoid a collision and suddenly both cars crash right into him.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{look out!}
<A>__{willie's body is crushed instantly between the two vehicles as his spirit is catapulted into the air still screaming and writhing. his ghostly form reaches out to people for help as they rush past. no one stops. willie spins around and sees a mangled body crumpled on the street. suddenly, he recognizes that it is his own dead body lying there. he begins to scream. a bizarre and frightening clicking sound fills the air. sam looks up. a group of strange dark figures has emerged from the shadows. with a loud, terrifying shriek, the dark forms swoop down and grab hold of willie. sam freezes. in an instant they are dragging willie, kicking and screaming, down through the sewer grates into the bowels of the earth.}
