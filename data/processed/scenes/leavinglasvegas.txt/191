<A>__{she sees that he is already asleep on the bed, his half naked body covered with countless bits of bloodstained tissue. the image has an almost religious feel to it. the tv is on and a sitcom is playing. something funny catches sera's attention. she laughs and sits on the bed next to ben.}

<D>__{i think we realized that we didn't have long and accepted it. my charm, for him, was that i accepted him exactly as he was and didn't expect him to change. i think we both realized that about each other. ben needed me and i liked his drama. i loved him.}
