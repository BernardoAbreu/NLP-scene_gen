<L>__{exterior living room, nice house day}
<A>__{the major is watching reruns of three's company. he doesn't laugh or remotely smile at any of it. the subtle click of a door opening does not escape his finely tuned senses.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{dwayne?}
<A>__{nothing. the major gets up and goes to a desk, rifles through a drawer and pulls something out. a simple pen. he clutches it like a weapon.}
<L>__{interior hallway, nice house day}
<A>__{the major creeps along.}
<C>__{vaughn }
<D>__{just stay where you are, old man.}
<A>__{the major turns to find vaughn pointing a gun at him.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{i'm looking for your son.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{even if i knew where he was, i wouldn't tell you nothing.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{don't be stupid.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{you know, i saved a black man's life in the shit. so if i took yours i'd be even.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{i see where your son gets his common sense.}
<C>__{vaughn }
<D>__{but you might want to readjust your attitude, because i ain't fucking around. i want dwayne. i don't know why you'd want to protect him, the motherfucker hired me to kill you.}
<A>__{if this news has any effect at all on the major, he doesn't show it.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{just tell me where he is!}
<A>__{vaughn pulls back the hammer of his gun.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{you think i'm scared of death? there's a whole generation of gooks that think i'm the grim reaper.}
<A>__{vaughn shakes his head. almost imperceptibly, the major repositions the hand with the pen in it. vaughn is about to squeeze the trigger but the major beats him to it, clicking the pen, which is actually a pen gun. it fires a .22 caliber round into vaughn's neck. he drops the gun and clutches the geyser of blood. the major charges vaughn, jumps on him and wrestles him to the ground, trying to jam the pen into the wound in his neck.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{i will ride you all the way to hell! i know exactly how to get there!}
<A>__{vaughn reaches for his gun. his fingers curl around it and he whips it across the major's face, knocking him backwards. vaughn scrambles to his feet, gun pointed at the felled major.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{what now, old man!? you can't kill me! none of y'all can kill me!}
<A>__{the major looks up at vaughn, once again face to face with a loaded weapon.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{go on and }
<A>__{bang! the major goes limp, one searing hole in his chest. vaughn clasps a hand to his neck to staunch the flow of blood. he steps over the the major's body and continues upstairs.}
