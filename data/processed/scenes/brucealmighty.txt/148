<A>__{bruce stands there, sees god as he originally found him, mopping. god looks up at bruce, not surprised to see him.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{they're all out of control. i don't know what to do.}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{you mind giving me a hand with this floor first?}
<A>__{off bruce's look. . .}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{bruce's sleeves rolled up, mopping next to god.}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{"poor man wanna be rich, rich man wanna be king, king's disatisfied 'cause he rules everything..."}
<C>__{god }
<P>__{(to bruce)}
<D>__{springsteen. i like a little boss in my head while i'm workin'...}
<A>__{they finish up. god looks back at the sparkling floor, satisfied.}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{there we go. wonderful thing. no matter how filthy something gets, it can always be cleaned right up.}
<A>__{god collects bruce's mop.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{what happened? i gave everyone what they wanted.}
<A>__{god sets the mops down.}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{since when does anyone have a clue about what they want?}
<A>__{god holds up a remote and clicks, changing the room into the diner where bruce first parted his soup. (note: whenever the room "changes" we're actually still in the room, but seeing a full projection of an environment on the walls and columns) the older waitress, ginnie, clears some dishes...}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{remember ginnie?}
<A>__{ginnie bends down behind the counter and when she comes back up she is a hot 21 year old.}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{ginnie thought she lost her beauty when she got older. i'm trying to convince her otherwise.}
<A>__{ginnie bends down again, and when she comes back up, she is her older self again. god clicks the remote, changing the environment into a school yard. we see the grade school where filbert davis, the boy bruce helped up the rope, is in a fight.}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{ah yes, filbert. brilliant young man. he was going to be a great poet.}
<C>__{god }
<D>__{the soul of his work would have been built out of his hardships. he would have touched millions.}
<P>__{(feigns cheery)}
<D>__{but now he's headed for a career as a professional wrestler.}
<A>__{god clicks, changing the environment into a condo. we see a lonely woman (who found the cash in her purse) sitting depressed, rocking in a chair.}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{ester maha. i love ester. ester was bankrupt. she was going to have to eat her pride and call her sister. would've got the two of them together again. instead, she bought a condo in florida.}
<A>__{god clicks the remote again...}
<C>__{god}
<P>__{(recalling bruce's own words)}
<D>__{and have you seen the news lately?}
<A>__{we see footage of the arctic sea and north and south poles...}
<D>__{newscaster #1 scientists believe last weeks asteroid may have knocked the earth off it's access resulting in the rapid acceleration of the melting of the polar caps. . .}
<A>__{click. more footage of floodwaters and rising tides...}
<D>__{newscaster #2 and more tidal wave activity reported and resulting in devastating floods all tied to last weeks abnormal lunar activity...}
<A>__{click. we see footage of decimated crops.}
<D>__{newscaster #2 that swarm of locusts spotted in buffalo has multiplied, wreaking havoc on local agricultural crops. food and produce prices are expected to skyrocket.}
<C>__{god}
<P>__{(to bruce, again using bruce's words)}
<D>__{now what kind of a god let's that happen?}
<A>__{god clicks the images off.}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{not as easy as it looks, is it? this god business.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{so what do i do?}
<A>__{god smiles, asks him again what he asked him in the alley...}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{you want some advice?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{god smiles, starts to walk away...}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{everybody wants a miracle, bruce. want me to do everything for 'em. but what they don't understand is, they're the one's holding the power.}
<A>__{god claps the bright ceiling light on, walks over to the latter.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{wait. where are you going?}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{this is good bye, bruce. you've learned a lot. i think you should be able to handle things now.}
<A>__{god climbs, ascending into the light.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{what if i have a question? what if i need you?}
<A>__{god stops, looks down to bruce.}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{see bruce, that's your problem. that's everybody's problem. you keep looking up. . .}
<A>__{he smiles and disappears into the light, leaves bruce thinking.}
