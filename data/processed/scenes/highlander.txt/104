<A>__{inside a small farmhouse commandeered for officer's quarters, dupont (conor) and several others eat their evening meal. a captain finishes his story.}
<C>__{captain}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{...and what a sight! that old mare just kept falling over her own guts till someone finally shot her.}
<A>__{the officers laugh. all but dupont.}
<C>__{major}
<P>__{(beside dupont)}
<D>__{complete your inspection?}
<C>__{dupont}
<D>__{they're nothing but boys. it will be a slaughter tomorrow.}
<C>__{major}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i doubt much can change that. the enemy has five brigades waiting for us.}
<C>__{dupont}
<D>__{we need more time.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{won't get it.}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{we are a sacrifice. a diversion.}
<A>__{dupont pokes unenthusiastically at his plate.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{eat up dupont. it will probably be your last.}
<C>__{dupont}
<P>__{(rises)}
<D>__{not likely.}
