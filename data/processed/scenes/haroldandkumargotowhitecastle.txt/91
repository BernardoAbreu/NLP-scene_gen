<L>__{interior convenience store}
<A>__{harold and kumar walk into the store, where they see cole and the punks are nonchalantly knocking over random items from the shelves. they then begin playing hackeysack with a hostess like pie. the cashier (an old indian man in his sixties) throws out a couple indecipherable protests...}
<C>__{indian cashier}
<P>__{(to cole and the punks)}
<D>__{please...the pies...do not...}
<A>__{cole and the punks ignore him. harold and kumar then approach the indian cashier...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{excuse me can you tell us how to get onto the highway from here?}
<A>__{the indian cashier shrugs his shoulders.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(to harold)}
<D>__{he probably can't speak english...}
<A>__{kumar says a few words in hindi, which lights up the cashier's eyes. kumar listens as the cashier tells him the directions in hindi it takes the cashier a long time to explain it. he mentions numerous streets and routes. it sounds like it's very complicated. meanwhile, while they are talking, harold suddenly sees two more extreme sports punks enter the store, carrying a kayak and a paddle. they carry the kayak to the back of the store. harold has no idea what the hell is going on. kumar and the cashier are too busy talking to notice. harold watches nervously as cole puts on a helmet and gets into the kayak...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{who knew that learning hindi would actually pay off? the guy says the highway's just down the road. we should be in cherry hill in ten minutes.}
<A>__{harold is still focused on cole and the extreme punks...}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(to kumar)}
<D>__{huh? oh, good.}
<C>__{cole }
<D>__{extreme kayaking!!!}
<A>__{harold, kumar, and the indian cashier immediately turn and look at cole, who is in the kayak which is being held up by}
<B>__{the extreme sports punks. the punks run down the aisle with the kayak and launch it into the air...}
<A>__{in slow motion, we see cole swing his paddle around in mid air, knocking over everything on the shelves bags of chips, glass jars of jelly, bottles of soda, etc. the extreme sports punks cheer cole on, while harold, kumar, and the indian cashier watch in disbelief. the kayak lands on the floor. cole gets out and celebrates with his friends.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{that was so fucking extreme, man! extreme sports punk #1 yeah man, on a scale from one to ten one being not so extreme, ten being extremely extreme, i'd give it a nine point five.}
<A>__{meanwhile, all the extreme sports punks begin going crazy throughout the store, knocking food off the shelves, bothering other customers. the indian cashier begins yelling at them in hindi. extreme sports punk #1 casually looks through a shelf of various kinds of snack chips, discarding them one after an other. finally, he stumbles upon extreme cheddar doritos. he goes apeshit over his find.}
<D>__{extreme sports punk #1 extreme cheddar!}
<A>__{he tears open the bag and starts pouring them into his mouth, getting the chips all over the place. the indian cashier is still yelling. cole picks up the cashier...}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{extreme cashier!!!}
<A>__{harold and kumar watch on as cole spins the indian cashier around and around.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{somebody should do something.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(to cole)}
<D>__{hey asshole! why don't you leave the guy alone and go jerk off to some snowboarding videos or something.}
<C>__{extreme sports punks}
<D>__{oooooooooh!}
<A>__{pissed, cole stops in his tracks and drops the cashier on the floor. he's pissed. it's clear to harold that they may get their asses kicked.}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(to kumar)}
<D>__{i didn't mean you should do something.}
<A>__{cole slowly walks over to kumar. the two stand face to face. cole looks pissed, but kumar keeps his confident exterior. it's a tense moment. suddenly, cole makes a quick motion as if he was going to hit kumar, trying to get him to flinch. kumar stands his ground without flinching, still looking cole in the eye. the punks don't know what to think as their leader is shown up. seemingly impressed by kumar, cole begins to turn around as if he's going to walk away, but he quickly doubles back, doing the same fake punch he did before. caught off guard, this time kumar flinches like a nervous weakling...}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(pissed off at himself)}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{cole and the punks burst out laughing.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{yeah, that's right, bitch! try fucking with me one more time. just try it!}
<A>__{cole jumps up and town gloating and pounding on his chest.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(to kumar, embarrassed)}
<D>__{come on, lets get out of here.}
<A>__{harold and kumar walk out of the store, deflated. with their leader victorious, the punks begin celebrating.}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(like apu)}
<D>__{thank you, come again!}
