<L>__{interior family room day}
<A>__{graham's eyes open. daylight fills the family room. he is alone on the couch. alone in the room. he looks to the television. it's not there. graham moves to his feet and look around the room. his eyes stop on an extension cord that runs from a wall outlet in the family room, across the front hall, and under a closet door. graham moves to the door. we hear muffled television voices. graham opens the}
<B>__{closet.}
<A>__{merrill looks up. he's seated on a kitchen chair with the television on a roll away stand crammed in with him.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{for the kids protection. all they were doing was watching tv from five a.m. i felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. they should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{what's furry, furry rabbit?}
<C>__{merrill}
<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{that's a game isn't it?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{anyway...}
<P>__{(points at the tv)}
<D>__{there's been some interesting developments.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{what time is it?}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{eleven a.m. they're gone.}
<A>__{beat. graham looks at the tv screen. there's a daylight shot of mexico city. the skies are empty above it.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{but they're not really gone. we just can't see them. early this morning a bird flew right at the area where the lights were hovering last night.}
<A>__{merrill puts a finger in the sky on the screen.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{it stopped dead in the air and fell straight down.}
<A>__{merrill's finger trails to the bottom of the screen.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{they caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. they found the bird. his head crushed in. when you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{they think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{the bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{already thought of. two other birds did the same thing an hour later. not as dramatic. they lived. but you could see they hit something.}
<A>__{graham looks at the empty sky on the screen with different eyes.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{they're still there hovering. in fact, some people think there's more of them now. all over the place. over us even.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and there's a theory about the crop circles now. they think it could be some kind of landmark, visual mapping system so they can navigate. coordinate. makes sense doesn't it?}
