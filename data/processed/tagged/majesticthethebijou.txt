<A>__{... in the blackness, falling s l o w l y, tumbling g e n t l y, a picture postcard:}
<D>__{"greetings from hollywood!"}
<A>__{then another... and another, each one dropping through frame, a gentle rain. in these old postcards, hollywood is a dream town where movie stars glide out of big cars to press their hands and footprints in the wet cement. another postcard:}
<D>__{"i'm meeting the stars at hollywood & vine!"}
<A>__{in this postcard myth, you'd toddle down to hollywood and vine, bump into bogie and bacall, and join them for dinner at the brown derby. or ciro's. or the coconut grove... more postcards. pictures of movie theaters, but not the ones that you and i know today. these are palaces. temples. grauman's chinese and egyptian. the carthay circle. the paramount, the million dollar. from a time when moviegoing was a complete experience, not a trip to the local mall. the ushers were friendly and helpful and wore gold brocaded jackets and guided you to your seat. the popcorn was hot and fresh and buttered with real butter, not 30 weight motor oil.}

<A>__{a wild jumble. then, one last postcard drops lazily on top of the pile. it's a view of hollywood at night, a carpet of lights under the yawning, protective smile of mt. lee's most famous resident, the fully lit hollywood sign. we push into the picture of the sign, dissolving until we're... ... pushing into the real hollywood sign, closer and closer, until we fly right through it then crazily loop up and behind it until we're looking down at...}

<A>__{super title: 1951 a gigantic aerial shot. postwar autos fill the muggy midsummer evening air with the sounds of thousands of honking horns, a mere precursor to the traffic yet to come. darkened outlying neighborhoods are evidence of the postwar home construction boom, as scores of stucco bungalows are being built in the areas surrounding the beating heart of the town, a swath of garishly bright concrete called}
<B>__{hollywood boulevard.}
<C>__{pete's narration }
<D>__{of course, it's not like the postcards say it is. this is what it's like. i'm pete appleton, and this is my town.}
<A>__{still in the same shot, we rocket down into the center of the intersection of hollywood and vine, then head west along the boulevard, skimming just above the traffic past musso and frank's grill and the hollywood canteen, past the egyptian theater and a rumbling pacific electric red car, across highland avenue, past the paramount theater, and across the street to grauman's chinese theater.}
<C>__{pete's narration }
<D>__{born and raised here, thank you very much. sometimes, it seems like everyone here is from somewhere else. but everyone loves the movies, so hollywood is everyone's town, and they come here by the busload. to them, grauman's chinese theater is just about the most exciting place on the planet. to me, it's the theater that's playing "the african queen."}
<A>__{and like the man said, the film on the marquee is "the african queen." still the same shot, buses disgorge tourists, who move into the forecourt of the theater. the men doff their hats and mop their brows. the women pull their blouses away from their chests, fanning themselves with movie star maps as they marvel at the signed cement blocks. we move among them, until we pick up a couple, and we stay behind them as they work their way through the crowd, on their way to the theater entrance, where an ornately attired doorman smiles and tears their tickets.}
<C>__{doorman}
<D>__{newsreel's just starting, folks.}
<C>__{pete's narration }
<D>__{that's me and my girlfriend. her name is sandra sinclair, and this is her town, too she's from cleveland. she came out here to be an actress, and that's just what she's doing. the first picture i ever wrote, a little potboiler called "sand pirates of the sahara." okay, it ain't "citizen kane," but you gotta start somewhere.}
<B>__{moving into the lobby}
<A>__{an explosion of glitz mixed with chinese myth and legend. everywhere you look, it's red and orange and plush carpeting and golden light. we move through the lobby, still in the same shot, still tracking the couple, heading for the auditorium doors, which are swept open by two ramrod erect ushers and we move into}
<B>__{the darkened theater.}
<A>__{as the couple, pete and sandra, find seats, we hear the soundtrack of the film before we see the screen, the unmistakable strains of a march, and then still in the same shot we see the screen...}
<B>__{a newsreel.}
<A>__{as the march swells to a crescendo, we hear the newsreel announcer's sonorous voice:}
<C>__{newsreel announcer}
<D>__{bringing the news of the world to you!}
<A>__{over a newsreel shot of a packed congressional committee hearing room, a title blares "hollywood reds go to jail!"}
<C>__{newsreel announcer}
<D>__{four years ago, in one of filmland's darkest hours, ten men, the so called "hollywood ten," were called to testify before the house committee of un american activities, investigating the proliferation of the dreaded red menace in hollywood.}
<A>__{we see several shots of witnesses engaged in heated verbal battles with congressmen, especially committee chairman t. johnston doyle and the majority counsel, elvin clyde.}
<C>__{newsreel announcer}
<D>__{refusing to answer the lawmaker's questions, cowering behind the fifth amendment's protection against self incrimination, the ten motion picture writers dared congress to come after them. well, come after them they did! and after years of court wrangling, it's now time to pay the piper!}
<A>__{over shots of several of the "hollywood ten" being led to jail in handcuffs, the newsreel narration continues.}
<C>__{newsreel announcer}
<D>__{and so, it's off to jail, the charge: contempt of congress! this should give you fellas something to write about now! a new round of investigations begins this fall, the mandate: get the reds out of hollywood!}
<A>__{in the audience, one man yells "lock up the commie bastards!," and a few others cheer and laugh. as the newsreel moves on to a somewhat more innocuous subject, we}
<B>__{wheel around and... endframe on pete appleton and sandra sinclair.}
<A>__{pete's a handsome fellow in his 30s, and sandra's a starlet pretty girl in her mid 20s. as she rummages in her purse, pete watches the newsreel.}

<D>__{pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you bet, honey.}
<A>__{pete kisses sandra on the cheek, then stands and sprints up the aisle to the concession stand, a big unworried grin on his face.}

<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(on the spot)}
<D>__{no. yeah... i... i don't know. maybe i did. leo, this was before pearl harbor. i was in college. it was a bunch of kids, and i was just one of 'em. i didn't believe in what they were saying. hell, i didn't even know what they were saying!}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{so, you're saying that it's true. you went to a meeting of a known communist organization.}

<D>__{don't take this personally, kid. if it were up to me, i'd have you testify wearing your uniform and your medal, wrapped in a flag with one hand on your heart and the other hand on a bible. what can i say? i like you.}
<A>__{leo lights pete's cigarette and his own. puts a fatherly hand on his shoulder.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{they don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them. they just don't want you writing pictures for now. that's all.}

<C>__{leo}

<C>__{pete}
<D>__{thanks...}
<A>__{he sets his suitcase down and takes off his coat. as he does, adele's copy of the constitution slips out of his coat pocket and falls open to the floor. pete picks it up and absently turns it over and the inscription inside the front cover catches his eye: to delly,}

<C>__{lawson's favorite son}

<A>__{we boom up to see pete and adele moving into and being enveloped by the crowd. spencer wyatt's band is assembled in front of the depot office, and they kick into some up tempo boogie woogie as we move up and away still in the same shot moving over the town, settling down again to grab a shot of the bijou's marquee. the neon chaser lights pop on, illuminating the sign, which reads:}
