<A>__{the chopper with its huge red cross painted on now rising to meet god. smashed on morphine, chris looking out at the waving ants below. now the trees, the skyline and the chopper is moving fast over the devestation. the jungle forever locked in his memory, chris looks back, copious, quiet tears flowing from his eyes.}

<D>__{i think now, looking back, we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves and the enemy was in us ... the war is over for me now, but it will always be there the rest of my days. as i am sure elias will be fighting with barnes for what rhah called possession of my soul ... there are times since i have felt like the child born of those two fathers ... but be that as it may, those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning to this life ...}
<A>__{the music surges now to its full strength as we replay bits of film with each actor's name listed some with silly, clowning looks, others sober, haunted. gardner, tex, king, rhah, lerner, sanderson, manny, big harold all the boys ... and then barnes staring quietly into the camera, and lastly elias shirt off, bowl of grass in hand, his big, beautiful smile.}
