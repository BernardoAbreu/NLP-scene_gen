<A>__{. vague sunlight. blurry. chris fluttering his eyes. a sharp movement in the bush. his eyes fight their way open. soft eyes are watching him from behind foliage. a soft, furry head, alert, rigidly still. chris fights his way up to his elbow, in pain, looking at the eyes. the head turns and in one fluid move, bolts. gone. like the wind. a deer. a big brown deer. or was it? chris will never be quite sure. but whatever it was, it was surely a sign of grace the grace of elias. this he knows as he feels himself for the first time alive. and in pain. his left hand torn and bleeding, shrapnel in his side, cuts on his face, dried blood caking him. looking around his garden of eden. a messy jungle floor. cordite fumes. burned bush and trees. torn sandbags. dead nva. bird songs somewhere in the distance. it is the very crack of dawn, a pink red sun casting long oblique light patterns through the trees. a holy light. chris pushes himself to his feet, feels his weight and the pain. he walks. in the near distance, towards the lz area, there's the sound of armored personnel carriers grinding, men moving, calling out in americanese. but chris is alone here. he fishes up an ak 47 from a dead nva. checks it, a weapon. walks on.}
