<A>__{several heads turn, then look down to see the puppet. the puppet wheels forward and stops.}
<C>__{barber }
<D>__{hello, sonny. cute outfit. mother get it for you?}
<A>__{the puppet crosses the room threateningly. two other clients look up startled from their newspapers and girly magazines. on the puppet it wheels up to the barber's leg and grabs his trouser with a mechanical claw. the puppet holds out a photo of white.}
<C>__{puppet }
<D>__{eeeeeeeek... ahhhhhhh!... shhhhiiiitttt!... fuuuucker!!}
<P>__{barber (looks down, scared now)}
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{he's grabbed and thrown into a nearby chair. the puppet leaps onto the bench in front of him he's frightened, so are the customers. puppet wheels up and down on the bench in front of the customers stopping to glance at individuals in a threatening manner, holding out the photo of white. it leans forward, spinning its blades hair flies. screams o.s. the puppet retracts its weapons covered in blood. it wheels forward, through the door and into the street. the camera pans to reveal a scene of complete carnage. blood covers the walls. four bodies slumped about the room. each has an outlandish hairstyle.}
