<A>__{dear lula, it is fine with me about the baby as you already know. and pace being your family name and all is just right. what about a middle name if it is a boy after my granddaddy roscoe? he would be proud i know though he is long passed. pace roscoe ripley does not sound so bad do you think? this place is not so pretty as pee dee. not pretty at all. there are boys inside these walls meaner than peru you can bet. there is a death house. i am getting along. the only thing is not thinking about the future. i miss dancing with you, too. i love you. it is hard to end this letter. if i stop writing youre gone. there is not a lot more to say though. vava con dios mi amor. sailor}
