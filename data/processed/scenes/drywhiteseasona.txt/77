<L>__{interior funeral parlor day}
<A>__{ben and stanley follow the proprietor who is expensively dressed in a dark suit. gordon's coffin stands as one of many in the room. inside the casket, brass fittings, white satin, lies gordon, incongruous, ludicrous in a black sunday suit. his hands are crossed on his chest like the claws of a bird and his face, barely recognizable, is gray, the left side distorted, blackish purple. there are rough stitches of the postmortem across his skull and a scar on his lips. stanley speaks in an african language to the undertaker. the man opens gordon's shirt and reveals the bruised and battered chest. stanley observes ben who looks at the wounds with horror. then another command from stanley and the undertaker opens the shirt to the waist. ben's ashen. stanley thanks the man and turns to leave. ben remains a minute. he shuts his eyes tightly. now he saw it. now he must believe it. he must accept that this battered corpse is gordon. as he follows stanley, he thanks the undertaker.}
