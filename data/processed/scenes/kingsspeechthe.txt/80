<L>__{interior bertie's study day}
<A>__{bertie is with visitors: churchill and lang. there's a slight but discernible change in his demeanor.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{we asked to see your highness because there's the urgent question of what to call your brother. aside from the obvious.}
<A>__{bertie is not pleased with his grace's joke, but lets it pass.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{what do you suggest?}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{mr. edward windsor? all he deserves.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{what has my brother given up on his abdication, other than the throne?}
<A>__{they look at each other, unsure.}
<C>__{bertie }
<D>__{wouldn't it be a good idea to find out before coming to me? he cannot be mister, as he was born the son of a duke. which makes him a lord at the very least.}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{very well, lord e.w. it is.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{and as a lord of the realm, he's entitled to be elected to the house of commons. heading a king's party.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{unacceptable!}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{so you prefer he takes a seat in the house of lords? again, on behalf of a king's party? is that acceptable?}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{certainly not.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{but if he's made a royal duke, and called his royal highness, he cannot stand for parliament. nor may he speak or vote in the house of lords.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{oh i say...}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{the duke of windsor it is. gentlemen.}
<A>__{he exits abruptly. churchill and lang gather their things stunned.}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{not exactly a dummy, is he?}
