<A>__{a shot of willcox hillyer and daddy as they walk with their drinks out to the patio.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{what's all this about rose? what do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{oh, i heard from her, i got a letter from her, she's fine. but there is some sad news.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{what sad news? did her cancer come back?}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{oh, no, no, she got all over that. rose is fine. let's sit down, son.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{is her husband sick or something?}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{no, it's another thing. i was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway i thought i'd wait till you got here. what did dave wilkie have to say?}
<A>__{another angle on willcox hillyer and the aged daddy as they sit on the patio sipping whisky. willcox hillyer is not disturbed or worried about rose, daddy has been very casual and offhand about it and he has no inkling of what the news really is.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{the pitiful son of a bitch said rose was a nymphomaniac.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{um hmm, and i suppose that incensed you?}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{you're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. he also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over washington. d.c.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(nods somberly)}
<D>__{yeah, i know, he was up here. it's pitiful like you say. when he lost rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost rose.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{he didn't lose her, he threw her away.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{yes, i guess he did. he threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<P>__{(staring off pensively into space)}
<D>__{you know, i don't know this town any more. all this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...}
<P>__{(pauses, almost as if in pain)}
<D>__{where have the years gone, daddy? where is the little town i knew as a boy?}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{at rest in the creative universe with mother, son.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<P>__{(a little smile)}
<D>__{that's what she would say herself.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(simply, he is not emoting)}
<D>__{a wonderful woman, boy.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{it always gives me a funny feeling to come home. dear old southland. gone. it's all gone, daddy }
<P>__{(a fond little smile)}
<D>__{ except you, you're still here.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(matter of factly)}
<D>__{not for long, boy. i've outstayed my welcome already.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{it's funny you would mention rose, i was thinking about her all the way up in the car.}
<P>__{(gives him a glance)}
<D>__{or maybe it isn't so funny.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(as if in previous thought)}
<D>__{i'm older than hell, boy. but this yankee whisky is mighty fine, i will say that.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{all right, daddy. we have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(simply, quietly)}
<D>__{no, son, she is dead.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<P>__{(numb with shock, for a}
<D>__{moment can't speak or}
<P>__{think)}
<D>__{dead, rose is dead? you mean... she died?}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{i am afraid so, son. about a week ago. her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<P>__{(in awful shock)}
<D>__{but... but how? she was young! rose wasn't old!}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{she was fifty six, son. of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. the cancer came back, i'm afraid i fibbed about that. but it was very quick, son. she was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<P>__{(in distress, a slightly choked voice)}
<D>__{excuse me, i will be right back.}
<A>__{willcox hillyer rises with his drink in hand and walks across the patio to the kitchen door.}
