<A>__{woodward at his desk dialing the phone. he's got the colson file spread out now, and we see pictures of the man and articles the post had done on him. but basically what we see is woodward plugging away on the goddamn phone and you'd think his finger would fall off from all the dialing and you know his voice is tiring as this montage goes on, you can hear it grow raspy. but a lot of what a reporter does he does on the phone, and that's what we're compressing here. the dialing never stops, the voices are continuous.}
