<A>__{carter arrives at the top of some narrow, steep, overgrown steps leading down to the river road, where his car is parked. he leaps down the steps as the jaguar screeches to a halt at the top. con leaps out of the jaguar and gives chase. peter backs the jaguar and roars off.}
<L>__{exterior river road day}
<A>__{carter comes running down the steps with con not far behind. he arrives at the river road. in the distance, he can see his parked car. as he nears the car park, peter's jaguar comes down the hill. it's going to cut carter off from his car. a sunbeam alpine sports car waits there. its engine roars into life and it races out of the car park. it reaches him just before the jaguar and slows down.}

<D>__{over here, jack.}
<A>__{carter sees that the driver is glenda. the hood is down, so he vaults into the car as it accelerates off. the sunbeam swings round, narrowly missing the oncoming jaguar, and roars away. peter hasn't a chance. he's facing the wrong way and has little room to manoeuvre. glenda laughs as the car swings wildly around a corner at the top of the hill.}
