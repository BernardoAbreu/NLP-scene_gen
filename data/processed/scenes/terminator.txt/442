<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior motel room night}
<A>__{angle on table the bombs are neatly ranked, finished. a nylon satchel lies nearby. the mess is cleaned up. wide shot reveals reese sitting in silent vigil at the window. the room is dark, lit only by a streetlight outside. sarah is asleep on the bed. reese sits cross legged, shirtless, his body held rigid. the image of discipline. the .357 is held loosely in one hand on his lap. there is a fresh bandage on his shoulder. sarah wakes up and goes to him in the darkness. he looks at her for a moment as she sits beside him, then back outside.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{he'll find us, won't he?}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{probably. sarah, if i get zeroed...}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{don't say that.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{if i do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. different country, different name, everything. in case they send another one.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{it'll never be over, will it? look at me, i'm shaking. some legend, huh? you must be pretty disappointed.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{no. i'm not.}
<A>__{several beats before sarah speaks again. her eyes seem luminous in the dark.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{good fighters.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{that's not what i meant. was there someone special?}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{someone?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{a girl. you know.}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(mechanically)}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{never.}
<A>__{he looks away, outside the window}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{sarah studies him for a moment. she's sitting slightly behind him and she puts her hands on his shoulders and back, tracing the lines of his scars with her fingertips.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{so much pain.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{pain can be controlled. you disconnect it.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{and so you feel nothing.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{it's better that way.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(with great sympathy)}
<D>__{oh, kyle.}
<A>__{reese takes a long, slow breath before he answers, and when he does his voice has a new quality, an unfamiliar tenderness.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{john connor gave me a picture of you once. i never knew why. it was very old. torn. faded. you were young, like you are now. you weren't smiling...just a little sad... i always wondered what you were thinking at that second.}
<A>__{he closes his eyes, reaches toward her. his fingertips trace the contour of her nose, chin, cheeks.}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i memorized every line, every curve...}
<A>__{he opens his eyes, looking right at hers.}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{sarah, i came across time for you. i love you. i always have.}
<A>__{sarah is quietly overwhelmed. reese looks away.}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i shouldn't have said...}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{kyle...}
<A>__{she leans forward and kisses him. his face is frozen. a mask. she continues, tenderly. he begins to respond. the dam breaks and he holds her in a tight, trembling embrace, clinging to her like life itself. kyle picks her up and carries her to the bed. she kisses his neck and chest, tracing his scars with her lips. he unbuttons her blouse very slowly. sarah guides his powerful hands over her.}
<B>__{a sequence of cuts. details. impressions.}
<A>__{sarah, a very close angle, as she grimaces in divine agony. reese, his face rapt. his hand, clutching the pillow as if to kill it. it is explosive, torrential. a confluence of fate and will.}
