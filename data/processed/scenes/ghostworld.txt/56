<D>__{now i remember why i haven't gone anywhere in months. i'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. i might as well be from another planet.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{we just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{look, i really appreciate your help, enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{it's not hopeless...}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{yeah, well it's simple for everybody else give 'em a big mac and a pair of nikes and they're happy! i just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{yeah, well, i can't relate to humanity either, but i don't think it's totally hopeless...}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{but it's not totally hopeless for you... i've had it. i don't even have the energy to try anymore. you should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything i do so you don't end up like me...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar... at least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{hooray for me.}
