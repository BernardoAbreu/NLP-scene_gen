<L>__{ext bond street evening}
<A>__{close up on parnassus's glass plinth..now open topped and sitting on the edge of the stage... full of the troupe's savings. a sign proclaims "please take generously" directly behind the glass box is a half globe with the continent of africa featured. sitting on top is percy playing something ethnic but tasteful on a flute with one hand...his other is held out pathetically... a beggar. he's blacked up and dressed in rags. he doesn't look happy. he sneaks nervous glances at the glass box of money. the wagon, newly painted in sleek and stylish black and white, stands in bond street or some similarly fashionable street with expensive shops and art galleries. rich women anxious to be conspicuous in their consumption of wealth glide past. new signs proclaim `the choice is yours' `the imaginarium more exclusive than ever'. the stage, hung with soft,flowing, gauzy fabric, has been chromatically divided in half one side black, the other white. on the dark side a bloated, sun glassed woman consuming vast quantities of food reclines on an elaborate lounge. she is, in fact, a very uncomfortable anton in full and fulsome drag. center stage stands dr. parnassus dressed as a stylized doctor with head reflector. in his hand is a staff with an elaborate sun on the top. he is blindfolded. on the white side of the stage stands the mirror and a stylized tree of knowledge with bright red apples. under the tree, and reflected in the mirror, sits valentina as eve...naked except for a long wig that maintains her modesty. she gracefully combs her hair. above the mirror is a sign proclaiming "the naked truth". dr. parnassus, peeking under his blindfold, is distinctly uncomfortable by his daughter's lack of attire. tony, in a beautifully cut white suit, and wearing his `romantic' venetian carnival mask sits in profile in a dreamy pose on the edge of the white side of the stage. nobody speaks. they pay no attention to the crowd. a few women stop, curious. one of them takes out some money and puts it in the glass plinth and turns to go.}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(retrieving the money)}
<D>__{excuse me, madam. i'm afraid we can't accept this.}
<A>__{the woman stops, confused. tony hands her back her money.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{we are here to give...not take. we are here to help those in need. if it's money you need, then here it is.}
<P>__{(referring to the glass plinth)}
<D>__{if it's the flowering of the soul you need, then here we are but, unfortunately we are booked solid at the moment. but thank you.. i can see you have a generous spirit.}
<A>__{tony returns to his pensive pose. the women look at each other.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{excuse me but, how does this work? what does it cost?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{cost? money is no good in the imaginarium. this is a refuge for hearts in need of truth. a place for souls to be purified.}
<C>__{woman 2}
<D>__{how long does that take? i'm running late.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{madam, why should you care about time? what are your dreams worth in minutes?}
<A>__{the women grow pensive.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{there are hard choices to be made in life.}
<P>__{(he indicates the tableaux)}
<D>__{what about the dreams of the less fortunate in the world. do you have time for their dreams? or are you like i once was...do you just despair? despair at all that is wrong in the world..}
<P>__{(getting to his feet)}
<D>__{...despair at your inability to do anything to change it.. to make it better...i despaired so much at the powerlessness of my own existence that i took the easy way out...the coward's way...i committed suicide! yes, that's right, i killed myself. can you understand my despair? but i was saved...saved by a miracle...the imaginarium...and doctor parnassus. he brought me back from the dead. he gave me a new life. a reason to live. he has given me power to dream again... to dream of a better world.}
<A>__{during his speech, more and more people have gathered. some are actually weeping. they are press forward putting money in the plinth. tony tries to stop them but, they insist. valentina, anton, percy, and dr. parnassus are astonished by tony's performance.}
<C>__{voices in crowd}
<D>__{stop pushing! excuse me, can one make a booking? are you taking bookings? stop pushing at the back! form a queue!}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{please, i'm sorry but, we're booked solid at the moment.}
<A>__{a louis vuitton dressed woman (60+ years old)at the back of the crowd shouts:}
<C>__{louis vuitton woman}
<D>__{is that child up for adoption?}
<A>__{she points at the blacked up percy.}
<C>__{louis vuitton woman }
<D>__{i want to adopt that unfortunate black child. it shouldn't be working like this. it should be in school.}
<A>__{percy is appalled.}
<C>__{louis vuitton woman }
<D>__{who's in charge here?}
<A>__{the louis vuitton woman looks around as a couple of police officers arrive on the scene. tony spots them too and heads off the louis vuitton woman as she makes towards them.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{madam, congratulations, you have been chosen.}
<A>__{the other women gasp.}
<C>__{louis vuitton woman}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{come forward and enter the imaginarium.}
<C>__{louis vuitton woman}
<D>__{but, i haven't paid.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{we don't want your money. we want your hopes and dreams. you may make a donation later, if you wish.}
<C>__{louis vuitton woman}
<D>__{but...}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{this is a rare moment. very few are chosen. don't miss this once in a life time opportunity. this way. please.}
<A>__{he ushers the uneasy louis vuitton woman onto the stage and guides her upstage. parnassus goes into his trance.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{believe me madam, you're the luckiest woman in the world.}
<A>__{the louis vuitton woman steps into the mirror. tony hesitates..a moment of uncertainty. valentina encourages him with a smile. he steps through. across the street a clock begins striking the hour.}
