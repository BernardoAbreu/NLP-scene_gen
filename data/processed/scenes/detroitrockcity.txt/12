<L>__{interior jam's bedroom day}
<A>__{jam gives the bullworker one final yank. this time it comes loose... not from his foot, but from under the bed. its handle lashes up slapping him across the face. ouch. fully awake now, jam throws on trip's denim jacket. he stuffs a drumstick into his left sock. we see "mystery" written on it. just as he's about to stick the other one in his right sock... without a second of warning, or even a knock, mrs. bruce suddenly enters. immediately jam stands.}
<C>__{mrs. bruce}
<D>__{jeremiah, what are you doing?}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{uhh... nothing.}
<A>__{she turns to his closet, the door blocking her view of the kiss poster. jam leaps to the window and yanks the "destroyer" shade. it shoots up, flapping around its rod. he's done this before. mrs. bruce peeks at jam from around his closet door. he stretches in front of the window.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{ahh, sunshine.}
<C>__{mrs. bruce}
<D>__{you're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{change? what's wrong with what i got on?}
<C>__{mrs. bruce}
<D>__{it's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes i bought you. you're skating on thin ice already, young man, so i wouldn't push my luck. now get out of those rags.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{but, mom!}
<C>__{mrs. bruce}
<D>__{besides, those jeans are so tight i can see your penis.}
<A>__{jam reluctantly takes off the denim jacket as mrs. bruce grabs the single drumstick from his hand and shakes it at him.}
<C>__{mrs. bruce}
<D>__{someday you'll see the futility in forging a musical career with those idiots.}
<A>__{she turns and rummages through the closet.}
<C>__{jam}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{they're not idiots.}
<C>__{mrs. bruce}
<D>__{now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. i will be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic kiss music... well, need i remind you of the consequences?}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{grounded for the rest of the year?}
<C>__{mrs. bruce}
<D>__{you're a smart boy, jeremiah. and so handsome.}
<A>__{she pulls two sears department store boxes from the closet and lays them on the bed. jam is visibly horrified.}
<D>__{this is your mother! the girl's room}
