<L>__{interior elementary school. corridor moments later}
<A>__{anna slips her phone back into her bag as she walks through the deserted corridor. her high heels echo loudly in the eerie quietness. suddenly one of the fluorescent ceiling lights behind her blows out with a loud whumph. anna starts. turns. whumph. the next light dies. anna quickens her step. the lights go off one by one. the darkness quickly creeping up behind her. there's only one light still on as she reaches the exit. she looks up. the light flickers. but then strangely stays on. bathing her in a cold pool of light. anna's unsettled. she turns and frantically pushes the door. it doesn't open. she pushes hard with both hands. nothing. it's locked. she turns back slowly. the darkness around her impenetrable. almost viscous. she reaches out... ... her hand disappears into the thick blackness. anna snatches her hand back. stares at it. then we hear the sound of slow footsteps. moving deliberately towards her.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{her voice echoes down the silent corridor. she glimpses something move in the blackness.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{is someone there?}
<A>__{a black shape materializes inside the darkness. silent. brooding. anna can't move. terrified. suddenly the corridor's flooded with a blinding white light. anna's dazzled. shades her eyes with her hand. as she tentatively pulls her hand away... ...it's only jack. his hand on the light switch.}
