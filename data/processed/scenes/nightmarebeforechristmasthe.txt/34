<L>__{interior evil scientist's kitchen. day later}
<A>__{outside, the alarms wail in the distance while, inside, sally speedily whips up a pot of sleeping potion soup. she keeps looking out the window, hoping for a hint of what's going on, but nothing not a clue. eager to find out, she hurries the soup along... various spice jars are out on the counter among them, the one labelled "deadly night shade," the entire contents of which she dumps into the pot.}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{regular dose... double dose... double, double dose. he'll be able to smell a double, double dose of deadly night shade... anybody could.}
<A>__{she studies the other jars and picks the one labelled "frog's breath."}
<C>__{sally }
<D>__{frog's breath will overpower any smell.}
<A>__{she opens the jar. recoiling from the odor, she turns aside, trying to escape the fumes as she pours some of the frog's breath into the soup but it starts to overwhelm her anyway. she swoons. her knees buckle. in her swoon, she fumbles blindly among the other jars.}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(choking)}
<D>__{sweet pea... where's that sweet pea... too bitter... too bitter...}
<A>__{her hand finally locates the jar labelled, "sweet pea." the evil scientist calls from another room:}
<C>__{evil scientist }
<D>__{sally?}
<A>__{still choking, hardly able even to squeak out an answer, sally struggles to open the sweet pea jar.}
<C>__{evil scientist }
<D>__{where's my soup?}
<A>__{sally finally gets the jar open. as fast as she can, she empties it into the soup and hovers above the pot. in a moment, the sweet pea takes effect and sally's strength begins to return.}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(gasps)}
<D>__{coming...}
<C>__{evil scientist }
<D>__{good. i'm hungry.}
<A>__{still a bit shaky, sally reaches for one more jar. the label on this one reads, "worm's wart."}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(hoarsely)}
<D>__{a handful of worm's wart just for distraction. it'll throw him off the trail for sure...}
<A>__{she drops in some worm's wart, stirs the soup, then ladles out a bowlful.}
