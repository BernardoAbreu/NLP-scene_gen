<D>__{i'm serious, he just pulled down his pants and yanked it out. you know, like, say hello to mr. happy.}
<A>__{teenage girl #1 gross.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{it wasn't gross. it was kind of cool.}
<A>__{teenage girl #1 so, did you do it with him?}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{of course i did. he is a really well known photographer? he shoots for elle on like, a regular basis? it would have been so majorly stupid of me to turn him down.}
<A>__{teenage girl #2 you are a total prostitute.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{hey. that's how things really are. you just don't know, because you're this pampered little suburban chick.}
<A>__{teenage girl #2 so are you. you've only been in seventeen once, and you looked fat, so stop acting like you're goddamn christy turlington. the two teenage girls move away from jane and angela.}
<C>__{angela}
<P>__{(calling off)}
<D>__{cunt!}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i am so sick of people taking their insecurities out on me.}
<A>__{the colonel's ford explorer pulls up, and ricky gets out.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{oh my god. that's the pervert who filmed me last night.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{him? jane. no way. he's a total lunatic.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you know him?}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{yeah. we were on the same lunch shift when i was in ninth grade, and he would always say the most random, weird things, and then one day, he was just like, gone. and then, connie cardullo told me he his parents had to put him in a mental institution.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{why? what did he do?}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{well, they can't put you away just for saying weird things.}
<A>__{angela stares at jane, then her mouth widens into a smile.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{you total slut. you've got a crush on him.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{what? please.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{you were defending him! you love him. you want to have like, ten thousand of his babies.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{shut up.}
<A>__{jane suddenly finds ricky standing in front of her.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{hi. my name's ricky. i just moved next door to you.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i know. i kinda remember this really creepy incident when you were filming me last night?}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{i didn't mean to scare you. i just think you're interesting.}
<A>__{angela shoots a wide eyed look at jane, who ignores it.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{thanks, but i really don't need to have some psycho obsessing about me right now.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{i'm not obsessing. i'm just curious.}
<A>__{he looks at her intently, his eyes searching hers. jane is unnerved and has to look away. ricky smiles and walks off.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{what a freak. and why does he dress like a bible salesman?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{he's like, so confident. that can't be real.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{i don't believe him. i mean, he didn't even like, look at me once.}
