<L>__{interior schikaneder's theatre night 1780's}
<A>__{noise; smoke; the audience is sitting at tables for an evening of vaudeville. mozart, constanze and their son karl, now about two years old, and sitting on his mother's lap, are watching a parody scene by schikaneder's troupe. they are rowdy, bawdy and silly, incorporating motifs, situations and tunes from mozart's operas which we have seen and heard. before them on the table are bottles of wine and beer, plates of sausages, etc.}
<B>__{the parody}
<A>__{on stage we see a set which parodies the dining room in don giovanni's palace, shown before. schikaneder as don giovanni is dancing with the three actresses to the minuet from don giovanni (end of act i), played by a quartet of tipsy musicians. leporello is handing around wine on a tray. suddenly there is a tremendous knocking from outside. the music slithers to a stop. all look at each other in panic. leporello drops his tray with a crash. all go quiet. one more knock is heard. then all musicians, actresses, don giovanni and leporello make a dash to hide under the table which is far too small to accommodate them all. the table rocks. schikaneder is pushed out. he is terrified. he shakes elaborately. three more knocks are heard; louder.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{who is it?}
<A>__{one more knock.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{c c c come in!}
<A>__{in the pit a chromatic scale from the overture to don giovanni turns into a anticipatory vamp. this grows more and more menacing until the whole flat representing the wall at the back falls down. an absurd pantomime horse gallops in. it has a ridiculous expression, and is manned by four men inside. standing precariously on its back is a dwarf, wearing a miniature version of the armour and helmet worn by the commendatore. he sings in a high, nasal voice:}
<C>__{commendatore}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{don giovannnnnnnnnni!}
<A>__{he tries to keep his balance as he trots in, but fails. he falls off onto the stage. he beats at the horse, trying to get back on.}
<C>__{commendatore}
<D>__{down! down!}
<A>__{bewildered, the horse looks about him, but cannot see his small rider who is below his level of sight.}
<C>__{commendatore}
<D>__{i'm here! i'm here!}
<A>__{the horse, amidst laughter from the audience, fails to locate him. exasperated, the dwarf signals to someone in the wings. a tall man strides out carrying a see saw; on his shoulders stands another man. the dwarf stands on the lowered end of the see saw. there is a drum roll and the man above jumps down onto the raised end and the commendatore is abruptly catapulted back onto the horse, only backwards so that he is facing away from don giovanni. the two men bow to the applauding audience, and retire off stage. the commendatore tries to extend his arms in the proper menacing attitude, and at the same time turn around to face don giovanni. this he finds difficult.}

<P>__{(speaking)}
<D>__{this is ridiculous. i won't have any of it. you're turning my house into a circus!}
<A>__{a trapeze sails in from above. on it stands a grand soprano wearing an elaborate turkish costume, like a parody of cavalieri's in il seraglio. she comes in singing a mad coloratura scale in the manner of martern aller arten.}

<A>__{the commendatore pulls out his sword, reaches up and thrusts her through with it. the soprano collapses on the bar of the trapeze. the audience applauds. at the same moment eight dwarves march in bearing a huge cauldron of steaming water. they sing as they march to the sound of the march that was cut from act iii of figaro. they are dressed as miniature copies of the chorus in that scene except that they are wearing cooks' hats.}

<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{we're going to make a soprano stew! we're going to make a soprano stew! and when you make a soprano stew! any stupid soprano will do! any stew stew stew stew stew! any stewpid soprano will do!}
<A>__{they set the giant pot down in the middle of the stage. the trapeze with the dead soprano is still swinging above the stage. we hear the chromatic scale from the don giovanni overture again, repeated and repeated, only now fast and tremolando. to this exciting vamp schikaneder suddenly rides in on a real horse, waving a real sword. with this he cuts the string of the trapeze, and the soprano falls into the pot. a tremendous splash of water. schikaneder rides out. more applause. all the dwarves produce long wooden cooking spoons and climb up the sides of the pot. the three girls produce labeled bottles from under their skirts. the first is salt.}

<D>__{hey! hey! watch out!}
<A>__{the vamp starts again vigorously. the horse's rear end swings around on a hinge to turn his hind quarters straight on to the audience. the rest of him stays sideways. his tail springs up in the air to reveal a lace handkerchief modestly hiding his arsehole. schikaneder offers him a handful of hay. the horse eats it, and out the other end comes a long viennese sausage. the audience roars with laughter. another handful of hay and out of the other end falls a string of sausages. then a large pie, crust and all. then a shower of iced cakes! suddenly silence. schikaneder produces an egg from his pocket. ottavio the horse rears up in disgust.}
<C>__{commendatore}
<D>__{whoa! whoa, ottavio! whoa!}
<A>__{leporello pries open the horse's mouth. schikaneder pops the egg into it. a breathless pause as a drum roll builds the tension, up and up and up, and then suddenly out of the horse's rear end flies a single white dove. wild applause. it flies into the audience. immediately all the cast start humming the lyrical finale from figaro: tutti contenti. more and more doves fly out from the wings and fill the theatre. everybody picks up the sausages and cakes and begins to eat. the end of the sketch is unexpectedly lyrical and magical, and then, suddenly, the tempo changes and the coarse strains of ich mochte wohl der kaiser take over and the whole company is dancing, frantically. a general dance as the curtain falls. it rises immediately. the audience including mozart is delighted. they applaud vigorously. schikaneder takes a bow amongst his troupe. among much whistling and clapping, he finally jumps off the stage and strides through the audience toward the table where mozart sits with his family. on stage, a troupe of bag pipers immediately appears to play an old german tune. some of the audience joins in singing it.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{well, how do you like that?}
<A>__{mozart is smiling; he has been amused. constanze has been less amused and is looking apprehensive.}

<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{yes, well, it's all good fun.}

<D>__{i liked the horse.}
<A>__{schikaneder sits at the table, and drinks from a bottle of wine.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{isn't he marvelous? he cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. i tell you, if you'd played don giovanni here it would have been a great success. i'm not joking. these people aren't fools. you could do something marvelous for them.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{i'd like to try them someday. i'm not sure i'd be much good at it.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{'course you would. you belong here, my boy, not the snobby court. you could do anything you felt like here the more fantastic the better! that's what people want, you know: fantasy. you do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because i've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood i can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. oh, and a few trick animals. you'd have to use those.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{animals?}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{i tell you i picked up a snake in dresden last week twelve foot long folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. it's a miracle.}
<A>__{mozart laughs.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{i'm serious. you write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, i will guarantee you'll have a triumph de luxe. mind you, it'll have to be in german.}

<D>__{german!}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{of course! what else do you think they speak here?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{no, no, i love that. i'd want it to be in german. i haven't done anything in german since seraglio.}

<D>__{how much will you pay him?}

<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{half the receipts! stanzi!}

<A>__{he rises in haste for his next number.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{stay where you are. you're going to like this next one. we'll speak again. triumph de luxe, my boy!}

<D>__{you're not going to do this?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{why not? half the house!}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{when? we need money now. either he pays now, or you don't do it.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{oh, stanzi.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{i don't trust this man. and i didn't like what he did with your opera. it was common.}

<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{half the house! you'll never see a penny. i want it here, in my hand.}
