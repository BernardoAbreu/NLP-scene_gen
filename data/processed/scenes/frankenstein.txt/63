<A>__{victor pours the final drum of fluid into what appears to be a large copper vat. he dips his hand in, examines the consistency and smell. angle widens, spinning slowly up to reveal that the vat is human in shape. a sarcophagus.}
<L>__{ext alley night}
<A>__{we find victor examining three corpses on the back of a wagon, checking nostrils and teeth with gloved hands. a pair of men lurk in the shadows, waiting.}

<A>__{victor wearing elbow length gloves, hacking furiously away with a bone saw. tossing aside the scraps. victor's garret night victor has an arm wired, testing reactions. he scrapes off a small shred of tissue, drops it in solution, watches it break apart. it doesn't look good. he glances feverishly at the clock, makes a fast decision, scribbles in his journal:}

<A>__{victor's garret night victor pulls on a chain, hoisting the body off the slab via block and tackle mounted on a ceiling track. the body rises limply into the air, spinning slowly, arms and legs dangling, long black hair covering its face.}
<C>__{arctic victor }
<D>__{a patchwork man of my own devising.}
<A>__{victor reaches up with one hand to stop the body spinning. he pushes it down the length of the lab, rolling it along its ceiling track like a side of beef in a meat locker.}
