<A>__{lippenreider is viewing the carnage through large binoculars on a stand. general mcgrath turns from the rail and faces loveless, outraged.}
<D>__{mcgrath why you sawed off sadistic bastard! you've betrayed us!}
<A>__{loveless turns to him, cocks his head.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{my dear general, after donating half my physical being creating a weapon capable of doing this... how did you and general lee repay my loyalty? you surrendered at appomattox! so, who betrayed whom?}
<A>__{loveless turns to munitia holding a steno pad.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{munitia, make note. turret speed needs to be accelerated!}
<C>__{munitia}
<P>__{(to amazonia)}
<D>__{change gear ratio from 2.2 to 2.8!}
<A>__{amazonia pushes a sick dignitary away from the rail so she can get a sight line to the tank with her lantern semaphore. she begins flashing the new gear ratio.}
<C>__{amazonia}
<D>__{a bucket for the minister, please!}
<A>__{now in the b.g., we hear the gatlings open up. lippenreider is reading the lips of the tank's victims.}
<C>__{lippenreider}
<D>__{scream. scream. my head. i'm dying. scream. moan. scream. mcgrath loveless, i demand you give the order to stop this slaughter now!}
<C>__{loveless}
<P>__{(ignores him)}
<D>__{... we're going to need more loading drills! i'm hearing too much time between screams.}
<A>__{as munitia scribbles dutifully, mcgrath shoves her aside. he pulls his pistol.}
<D>__{mcgrath for the last time, give them the order to desist!}
<A>__{loveless, his back to him, is seemingly unconcerned at having a gun barrel pressed against his skull.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{general, i understand your distress. but believe me, those men are not dying senselessly. it is for a far greater cause than you can imagine.}
<A>__{as loveless's right index finger finds a black button on the arm of his wheelchair... close angle loveless's wheelchair arm the steel tubes that comprise the armrests are actually shotgun barrels facing fore and aft. mcgrath's finger tightens on the trigger.}
<B>__{wider}
<D>__{mcgrath go straight to hell, sir!}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{after you... sir.}
<A>__{booom!!! mcgrath has a very startled expression as he looks down at the aftereffects of double ought buckshot. as he crumples to the deck, loveless sniffs.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{bloodbath mcgrath indeed.}
<A>__{the dignitary's dog starts barking, jumps to the deck. it sits next to the fallen general's gramophone ear and cocks his head. with the rca logo invented we move back}
<B>__{to... angle on loveless}
<A>__{he sighs at his pale guests. they don't seem to appreciate the efficiency of his slaughter.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{well, that concludes the festivities. ladies, feed him to the crabs.}
<A>__{munitia and amazonia unceremoniously dump mcgrath's body overboard. sploosh... loveless addresses the dignitaries...}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{but, my friends, that tank is just a little ol' toy compared to what this country's greatest scientists are cooking up for me nexterior so if i've piqued your interest, bring 1000 kilograms of your country's gold to spider canyon four days from now.}
<P>__{(starts to roll off boat)}
<D>__{now if you'll excuse me, i've got a tank to catch.}
