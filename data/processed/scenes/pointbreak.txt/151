<D>__{figured you did.}

<L>__{exterior santa monica airport}
<A>__{long lens shot through a forest of small planes as pappas' sedan glides into frame. it moves sharklike among through the cessna forest. slows to a stop. through the jungle of wings and fuselages we see pappas get out of the car and start working his way among the aircraft. utah slides behind the wheel and drives on. tight on turboprop engine roaring as it warms up. the same aircraft as before. bodhi and nathaniel are loading duffel bags into the open back door as the pilot completes his pre flight checks. the ex president's suits have been removed, along with the body armor, and no guns are in sight. just a couple of guys getting ready for a charter flight. bodhi looks up and stops his work as... the fbi sedan stops about 50 feet away. nathaniel pulls a shotgun out of one of the duffels. utah gets out. he holds his hands out from his body and turns completely around. without his jacket on, it is evident that he is not carrying a gun. he walks forward.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{i'm not armed.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{but you're not alone.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{good guess. there's a gun on you right now.}
<A>__{bodhi feigns casual interest. looks around. he can't see... pappas nearby. moving cat like behind a row of service vehicles. he gets his snubnose .38 propped on the bumper of one, with a clear shot at bodhi and nathaniel.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{where's roach?}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{around somewhere. listen, i'm in kind of a hurry, johnny u. what can i do for you?}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{you gotta tell me where she is.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{and let my policy expire? sorry.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{look, bodhi man. people are dead. the ride is over.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{i say when it's over!}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{the guy you killed was an off duty cop! if you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land. they have a new thing called radar. maybe you've heard of it.}
<A>__{though he can't hear what's going on. the pilot has clocked the tension between the two men. and the shotgun in nathaniel's hands. he blanches, and starts to shut down the plane's power. by his reaction we see that he's obviously not in on it. roach comes out of the hangar building nearby. neither utah nor pappas see him. but he sees pappas drawn down on bodhi. he drops quickly to one knee and opens the duffel he was carrying. tight on duffel bag, as it opens. the pistol grip of a 12 gauge riot gun sticks out of lots and lots of money. roach's hand slides the gun out slowly. utah is very close to bodhi.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{i know you man, when they fall on you, you won't back down. they'll have to burn your ass to the ground. and i can't stop them... i'm the last person they're ready to listen to right now. thanks to you.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{shit may or may not happen.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{look, you got a death wish, you want to ride to glory... fine! but don't take her with you, man. i'm begging you... tell me where she is. then i walk away. we've earned that much trust, haven't we?}
<A>__{the pilot opens the door and is climbing out when nathaniel wheels on him. the pilot goes cross eyed staring down the muzzle of the 12 gauge, inches from his face.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<P>__{(to the pilot)}
<D>__{back in the hotseat, campadre. now!}
<A>__{behind the trucks, pappas senses something. his head snaps around. roach is behind him with the 12 gauge. he fires. pappas hurls his weight sideways, as the buckshot punches into the truck fender. some of it catches pappas in the hip. he hits the ground hard and whips up the .38 bam! bam! bam! roach flips onto his back. the shotgun blows a hole in the sky as he hits the deck. pappas is on the ground, totally exposed, 20 feet from the others. nathaniel fires once, wild. terrified. his shot blows a divot out of the asphalt next to pappas. he pumps the slide, chambering another round. then pappas' fourth and fifth rounds drill into him. he slams back against the cessna's fuselage. slides down. two red smears on the white aircraft. bodhi lunges for the fallen 12 gauge. pappas takes aim. one round left. utah sprints between them.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{angelo! don't fire!}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{kid, get outta the way!!}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{nooo!!}
<A>__{utah is blocking bodhi with his body. bodhi's fingers are poised, frozen, a few inches from the shotgun. standoff.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{goddammit!!}
<A>__{he snaps the pistol up, aimed at the sky. pappas stands panting. enraged and frustrated. pain searing his leg. everything is tense and electrified. boom!! pappas' chest explodes with a spray of blood! behind him, roach is lying on one elbow in a pool of scarlet. he cocks another round into the chamber and fires again. boom! angelo drops to his knees, holding his ruined body like he's hugging himself. johnny lunges toward him, his face distorted with shock.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{nnnoooooo!!!}
<A>__{angelo's eyes meet his for a moment. in his dilated pupils is the great question. then he slumps forward and lies very still. the breath leaves his body and doesn't go back in. johnny moves toward his friend in a daze. drops to one knee beside him. roach aims the shotgun at him, coughing blood. utah doesn't notice. or is beyond caring. bodhi holds his hand up in a gesture like a benediction. roach's finger relaxes on the trigger. utah puts his hand on angelo's white crewcut hair. he hears the scraping of steel on asphalt behind him as bodhi picks up the other twelve gauge. roach is working himself to his knees. his breath is sucking through a bloody hole in his chest as well as the customary breathing orifices. bodhi crosses to him and helps him up. he covers utah with the shot gun as he half carries roach to the plane. the pilot is white with shock. he'd run if he could remember how.}

<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{thanks for telling the nice fbi agent where we're going.}
<A>__{roach works his way up into the plane. he waves the shotgun at the pilot, his face a vicious, blood flecked mask.}
<C>__{roach}
<D>__{get in the fucking plane.}
<A>__{bodhi stands behind johnny, the shotgun aimed at his head. their expressions are lethally cold. we see that utah hates this man who was his friend, his teacher, more now than he dreamed it was possible to hate.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{we're gonna ride this out, all the way, johnny. you and me. let's go.}
<A>__{johnny nods slowly, as if accepting that this was all somehow pre ordained, and that they both knew the game would take them this far and beyond. he stands and walks to the plane.}
