<A>__{an ipod and speaker dock now occupy a small plywood shelf attached to the railing outside clyde's cell. a guard plugs it in via a long orange extension cord. angle widens to iger, who turns to the bars and hands a remote control through to clyde. dixon's watching balefully, as is every inmate on the cellblock.}
<C>__{iger}
<D>__{the player stays out here. you hand the remote to the on duty guard every night at lights out. those terms aren't negotiable.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i appreciate your compromise.}
<A>__{iger draws close to the bars. quietly:}
<C>__{iger}
<D>__{you looking to get your ass kicked?}
<P>__{(off clyde's look)}
<D>__{by every inmate on this cellblock. you keep this up, they'll take it out on you. harshly.}
<A>__{clyde glances back to dwight. dwight's watching, glowering, agreement in his silence. clyde turns back to iger.}
<C>__{iger}
<D>__{just trying to keep you alive in here. that's all.}
<A>__{iger walks away. clyde aims the remote. music starts playing. he leans his head on the bars, listening, blissed. cons all over the cellblock are staring daggers at him.}
<C>__{clyde }
<P>__{(pre lap)}
<D>__{i took his fingers with a bolt cutter. his toes with a pair of tin snips. his balls with a hacksaw...}
