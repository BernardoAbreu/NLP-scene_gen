<ACTION>__{Pulling out a crumpled piece of yellow paper, HEATHER CHANDLER smiles. The content of what Heather says is consistently offensive but the tone in which she speaks is sexy, dangerous, and mysterious. She is a mythic bitch.}

VERONICA hands the note to an impressed HEATHER CHANDLER. MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK pays the CASHIER and then, grasping her lunch tray with both paws, moves toward VERONICA and the HEATHERS. HEATHER MCNAMARA excitedly tugs on HEATHER CHANDLER'S arm as MARTHA approaches. With a tranquil smile, HEATHER CHANDLER passes the note to her frantic disciple. In a self-consciously clandestine manner, HEATHER MCNAMARA saunters past MARTHA then wields around to sneakily tuck the note onto MARTHA's tray. The slow motion concludes as their plump victim shuffles past a magnetic preppie PETER DAWSON and a thin, black, bespectacled DENNIS. The guys are working a large stand which has a cashbox reading THE FAMINE FUND and a banner reading WESTERBURG FEEDS THE WORLD.}
