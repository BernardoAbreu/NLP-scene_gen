<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{outside of the subway station}
<L>__{30 minutes later. the chaos outside dodger stadium has}
<A>__{subsided. madison and two paramedics lead the bandaged college student to an ambulance. madison goes to parker, who sits quietly by himself. elbows on his knees. head between his hands. staring at the cement between his feet.}
<C>__{madison}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{do you have any idea the trauma you put that kid through?!}
<A>__{parker doesn't respond. all around them, a cacophony of news broadcasts is heard. from passing cars. from boom boxes. from portable tvs. over and over, you hear what sid 6.7 had said while killing the woman in dodger stadium:}
<C>__{sid 6.7 }
<P>__{(recorded)}
<D>__{hey, parker, this one's for you... hey, parker, this one's for you...}
<A>__{as parker raises his head slowly, you realize you are looking at the face of a wild animal. eyes rabid. jaw clenched. pure anger. violence about to erupt. without fear. without guilt. the beast within has been unleashed.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(in a whisper)}
<D>__{that's grimes...}
<A>__{madison backs away in fear. parker rises gradually.}
<C>__{parker }
<P>__{(voice slowly rising) the man who}
<D>__{killed my wife...who killed my daughter...who ruined my life used to taunt me with that line...}
<A>__{parker advances toward madison, who continues backing away.}
<C>__{parker }
<P>__{(exploding)}
<D>__{grimes is back! he's back! he's come back!!!}
<C>__{madison}
<P>__{(standing her ground) no! grimes}
<D>__{isn't back. he's only one part of sid. sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than grimes ever was.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{get a hold of yourself!}
<A>__{she tries to grab him by the shoulders. parker blocks her arms away.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(going nosetonose)}
<D>__{but he's in there. and you knew it, didn't you? didn't you?!}
<A>__{she tries to back away, but backs herself against a light pole. madison has nowhere to go. parker grabs her by the collar, and shoves her against the pole. hard.}
<C>__{parker }
<P>__{(hysterical)}
<D>__{god, you fucking know it all! you've known all along and didn't}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{tell me! why?! were you afraid i'd lose it?! go over the edge?! huh?! is that what you were afraid of?! why didn't you tell me??!!!}
<A>__{a prison transport and another police vehicle pull up to them fast. two of the prison guards met earlier jump out of the transport, advancing on parker. their weapons aimed at his head.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{hands up! now!}
<A>__{parker slowly raises his hands in the air. a guard relieves him of his weapon.}
<C>__{madison}
<P>__{(recovering)}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{he's going back where he belongs.}
<A>__{deane and cox step out of the police vehicle.}
<C>__{deane}
<P>__{(to madison)}
<D>__{you were right, dr. carter. letting a lunatic like barnes loose in the real world did pose an unacceptably dangerous risk to the public.}
<P>__{(glancing at cox)}
<D>__{i should have never tried to solve one problem by allowing the creation of another.}
<P>__{(to madison)}
<D>__{chief cox will give you a ride back to the station. you will provide him with any and all information you have developed thus far.}
<P>__{(to parker)}
<D>__{enjoy the rest of your sentence, mr. barnes.}
<A>__{she exits. cox and parker stand facing each other. cox wishes there was something he could do. parker looks completely out of it. cox extends his hand. after a moment, parker takes it. but his mind is way off elsewhere.}
<C>__{guard}
<P>__{(forcefully to parker)}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{madison looks on as parker is herded roughly into the back of the prison transport.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{parker...}
<A>__{parker shuts her up with a look. there is nothing that can be said. the prison transport doors are slammed shut. the vehicle takes off.}
