<L>__{exterior building rooftop day}
<A>__{edward, vance, stuckey and jake walk toward the building's edge. they look out over the empty shipyard as vance describes it.}
<C>__{vance}
<D>__{okay... this is the jewel in kross's crown. we can strip out all the heavy equipment. some of the cranes are very valuable overseas. the japanese are salivating for them.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{prime industrial property straddling the port of long beach and los angeles. it gives me a hard on.}
<A>__{edward points toward one of the edges of the shipyard.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{what's that long building over there?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{storage, i think.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{not with those smokestacks it's not.}
<C>__{vance}
<D>__{let me check.}
<A>__{vance pulls out a notebook.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{the real estate possibilities are endless. most of the yard we'll just level. i talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said }
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you what?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i talked to some developers about the land.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{what kind of an idiot are you? you don't talk about this to anyone.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{they're close friends, they'd never breathe a word }
<C>__{stuckey}
<P>__{(to vance)}
<D>__{where did you dig this moron up?}
<C>__{vance}
<D>__{he's right, jake, that was an incredibly stupid thing to do. it won't happen again, edward. i will pull him off the project immediately.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{don't bother.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{what!?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{we don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. besides...}
<P>__{(not unkindly, to jake)}
<D>__{you've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{it won't happen again, mr. harris.}
<A>__{vance has found what he was looking for in his notebook.}
<C>__{vance}
<D>__{this is interesting. that building is storage now, but it used to be a smelting plant. they closed it down after world war ii.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i want our lawyers to check into the toxic waste licences on them right away. i want to know if the permits are still valid and what kind of limits are on them.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{jesus, yes. it's a long shot but if the permits are still in effect, they're worth a fortune.}
<A>__{he turns away. the other follow edward back toward the stairs.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{what time's diner tonight?}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{eight o'clock. kross is bringing his son. very bright kid, watch yourself with him. who's this girl you're taking?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{no one you know.}
