<P>__{(very intimate)}
<D>__{here's to us.}
<A>__{she sighs and drinks.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{so are you making any new year's resolutions?}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{i want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{for one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{all right, you want to be real? so tell me why did you dump me?}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{oh, peter, i didn't dump you. i just had to protect myself. you really weren't very good for me, you know.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{i'm not even good for me.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{why do you say things like that? you're so much better than you know.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{thank you. if i had that kind of support on a daily basis, i could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.}
<C>__{dana}
<P>__{(already feeling the effects of the champagne)}
<D>__{so why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{let me jingle you right now.}
