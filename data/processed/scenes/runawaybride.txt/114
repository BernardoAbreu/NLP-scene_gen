<L>__{interior trout's barn night}
<A>__{it's a small barn that's been converted into a luau with a bar. a band plays for two hula dancers. the trouts had decorated it as a little slice of hawaii. there are tiki lights, numerous rented plastic palm trees and fiberglass copies of hawaiian statuary. strings of colored lights crisscross the ceiling. it looks like a hawaiian high school gym on prom night. maggie's family, mrs. trout and people we've already met, and more, are here, milling around wit tropical drinks garnished with umbrellas. plastic leis abound and most people have managed to find their old hawaiian shirts. as we come in, the hula dancers finish their applause and mrs. trout announces. hula dancers stop.}

<A>__{this year, we're dedicating our first dance to the soon to be newlyweds, the king and queen of hawaii, maggie and bob. the couple enters. bob is a goody bronzed god in his king kamahamela outfit. maggie is spectacular in her authentic looking hawaiian princess get up. but her face reflects none of the festivities around her. every now and then, she looks up and glances around for ike, hating herself for it.}
