<L>__{exterior third blast site moments later}
<A>__{structures 100 feet away look like they've been hit with a god sized sawed off. the crater: 25 feet wide, 7 feet deep. blackened frames and bits of vehicles circle the crater. the bottom of the crater filled with water. a syphon pump works overtime. no sang investigators around.}
<P>__{colonel al ghazi (o.c.)}
<D>__{about one hour into the rescue.}
<C>__{adam leavitt}
<D>__{hit a water main? colonel al ghazi no from the tanks of this fire engine: that's the water that didn't evaporate in the blast.}
<A>__{al ghazi points to a mass of black metal: looks like a fire truck the way a jackson pollock looks like the mona lisa. leavitt and grant stand back. quiet:}

<P>__{(eyes on fleury)}
<D>__{hole is the case. see, there's "evidence" down in that hole. you understand evidence? little things that are "clues." clues can be very helpful to a fella when he's trying to solve a crime. colonel al ghazi i understand that.}
<C>__{grant sykes}
<D>__{glad to hear it. so can we get in there? colonel al ghazi no.}
<A>__{sykes holds al ghazi's gaze. smiles.}
<C>__{grant sykes}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{fleury is taking in the entire crime scene. he notices a four story building half a mile off the perimeter. he watches al ghazi rip at a chunk of floorboard wedged into the mud, bag it himself, search for someone to give it too. nobody. sets it down. stands, wipes his hands hard on his pants. fleury could swear the dirt stains are intentional: trying to feel like he's doing something.}
