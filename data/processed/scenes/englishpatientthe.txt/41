<L>__{exterior basecamp at pottery hill. night.}
<D>__{later, supper over, the company is entertaining itself.}
<A>__{almasy, standing outside his tent, watches the merriment from a distance. d'ag is nearing the end of a passionate rendition of puccini's e lucevan le stelle. he sits down to much applause from the others and spins an empty champagne bottle on the sand. it comes to rest pointing at clifton who gets up, grinning, and plunges into yes! we have no bananas with great gusto. his version involves changing language during each line of the chorus prompted by oui! or ja! or si! from the others. song finished, much bowing and guying, he spins the bottle and it arrives equidistant between fenelon barnes and katharine until with a little nudge from the husband it settles on his wife. katharine gets up, awkward.}

<C>__{katharine}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{yes, thank you, gyges, son of daskylus candaules said to him i don't think you believe me when i tell you how beautiful my wife is. and although gyges replied he did find the queen magnificent the king insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women. do you all know this story?}
