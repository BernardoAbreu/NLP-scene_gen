<A>__{jimmy joins debbie and the cop in the hallway. steven is visible in bed through the glass.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{did you know steven was wanted?}
<C>__{kemple}
<D>__{not until just now.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{he likes to keep little secrets sometimes.}

<D>__{like the fact that he was a big queer?}

<C>__{kemple}
<D>__{but suicide, my god.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{well he does tend to overreact.}
<C>__{kemple}
<D>__{i feel like i don't even know him.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{well jimmy, that's the thing. i'm not really sure he knows who he is. he's searching, at least that's how i figure it. i'm just not sure he knows what it is he's looking for.}
<C>__{kemple}
<P>__{(to cop)}
<D>__{can you tell me exactly what he did?}
<A>__{as they continue to talk, they fail to notice steven getting out of bed and looking around blearily. he picks up a bedpan, reaches into his gown and absent mindedly pisses missing the pan completely.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{he has several warrants out in texas. fraud, forgery, embezzlement...}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{kemple}
<D>__{i should have known... i should have said something.}

<D>__{don't blame yourself jimmy... i did the same thing. there were always signs. i should have known he was gay when he started shaving his chest.}
<C>__{kemple}
<D>__{that would be a warning sign...}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{and all that peter allen music on his walkman.}
<C>__{kemple}
<D>__{denial is a powerful thing. i don't feel so bad now.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i just never thought. but now stealing?}
<C>__{kemple}
<D>__{he's probably been doing it for years. i say to myself he did it just to buy me things but i don't think that's true.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{it's bigger than that. i'm sure.}
<C>__{kemple}
<D>__{but why then?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{and why suicide? i mean just like that?}
<A>__{after that, he dresses and walks out the door behind them.}
<C>__{kemple}
<D>__{i know he seemed so happy and }
<A>__{just then debbie notices steven is not in bed and looks up in time to see him disappearing around the corner.}
