<A>__{levin, feeling out of place, is at the washstand. he notices there is a prettily wrapped new cake of soap. he picks it up and puts it to his nose. masha and kitty are kneeling by the bed. the priest bends over nikolai holding up an icon in front of nikolai's face and murmuring the prayers. levin, embarrassed, puts down the soap and comes forward and kneels too.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{nikolai is at the point of death. levin stares, torn between the mystery and the lack of mystery, the ordinariness of the body finally wearing out. the death rattle comes. masha kisses the dead hand. the priest continues to murmur. kitty takes hold of masha's hand. levin stares into nikolai's face: if this is death, what is life?}

<A>__{nikolai lies dead, candles burning at his head and feet.}
