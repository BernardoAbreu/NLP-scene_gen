<L>__{interior peppy's house storeroom day}
<D>__{george goes into the room that's full of sheets. he goes straight over to the object with the bizarre shape and lifts up the sheet. underneath he finds his former objet d'art, the three monkeys "hear no evil", "speak no evil" and "see no evil". he thinks for a moment, then pulls of another sheet to reveal a piece of furniture. once again it's a piece that used to belong to him and we recognize it from having seen it at the auction room. after taking off several other sheets, george realizes that she bought everything he had put up for sale: furniture, paintings, objets d'art, souvenirs, etc. he rips off sheets one after the other and the objects appear, even down to his suits and tuxedos. he continues and discovers the painting depicting him in a tux, waving and smiling. george looks stunned at the sight of himself looking so full of life. he's interrupted by the same ray of light which surges into the room once more. this time, at the door, are the butler and the maid. george walks towards them when he sees them. the closer he gets to them, however, the more his expression tightens. we realize that the butler is none other than the distinguished looking man who purchased everything at the auction, and that the maid is the woman who was bidding against him to raise the sale prices. george is looking at them as he leaves the room. he has recognized them, but doesn't say anything to them. he walks off, still shocked by what he's just realized.}
