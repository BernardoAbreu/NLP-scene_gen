<L>__{interior diner day}
<A>__{this is a great place a major hub of social life in hale. the food is greasy and good, mrs. pressman is the waitress, and the crowd the essence of what is wonderful about a small town. bob, maggie and ike sit on the counter. mrs. pressman chuffs about the luau, then moves around the corner.}
<C>__{bob}
<A>__{mrs. pressman, i think we're ready to order.}
<C>__{mrs. pressman}
<A>__{we're out the special because somebody...}
<P>__{(indicates cook with head)}
<A>__{... didn't order enough sausage.}
<C>__{bob}
<A>__{let me have the garden omelette. egg whites only. ike looks at maggie. he'd bet a thousand bucks on what she'd say nexterior}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i will have the same.}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(clears his throat)}
<A>__{of course.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{what was that? i can't order my eggs without sarcasm?}
<C>__{bob}
<A>__{neutral corners you two. you're on the same team now. any more fighting and it's fifteen minutes in the penalty box.}
<P>__{(gently, to ike)}
<A>__{maggie's the nicest person you'll ever meet. but she's always focusing out there. she's got to start focusing more in here.}
<P>__{(taps his chest)}
<A>__{that's why she's had some whatever you want to call it problems in the past.}
<P>__{(to maggie)}
<A>__{that's what we're working on focus. right, maggie? focus on maggie. focus on bob. as bob has been talking, ike has been watching maggie's face. the joy seems to have drained out of her.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<A>__{right.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(to ike)}
<A>__{i lead maggie through a visualization exercise. all the sports shrinks use this head stuff. visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift. bob takes out a notepad and hands it to maggie.}
<C>__{bob }
<A>__{here's today's mantra: "it's an open field to big bob."}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{tell me. when you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{you know, there's no... before maggie can finish, ike intercepts her.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{well, i'm off. a reporter's work is never done.}
<P>__{(heading to the door)}
<A>__{mrs. pressman, thank you.}
<C>__{mrs. pressman}
<A>__{tootaloo.}
