<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{dry yourself with this.}
<A>__{he starts taking off his clothes. he does it quickly without any sense of awkwardness; the world where he came from makes little distinction between male and female. she's not from the same world, keeping herself as covered as possible with a tree branch. he jumps in the shower while she tries to dry herself off.}
