<L>__{interior post office (pine view) night}
<A>__{long ago stripped, it still has a proud, official, almost holy feel. the postman wanders in, stops to read the credo calligraphied on the wall. "neither snow, nor rain..." he turns at a sound. ford is here, leaning against a wall.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{i knew you'd come here.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{you did, huh?}
<A>__{ford nods. a sage sixteen year old.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{how do you get to be a postman, anyhow?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{you have to be in the right place at the right time.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{how could i do it?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i thought you wanted to drive cars.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{not anymore. that was kid's stuff. this is real. so, where's the right place?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{could be anywhere. anytime. only another postman can make you a postman.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{kinda like vampires, right?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{something like that. you have to be sworn in.}
<A>__{ford raises his right hand, palm out, ready to take the oath. it takes the postman a moment to realize.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{the organization's kinda shaky. it might not last.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{what does?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{you'd meet a lot of people who don't believe in you.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{i will set them straight.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{it's a lonely job.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{i've been lonely all my life.}
<A>__{this response strikes a chord. the postman sees how badly ford wants something to hold onto. he sees himself.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{so have i, ford. so have i.}
<A>__{the postman looks up at the creed on the wall. finally...}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{what the hell? repeat after me. postman ford}
<P>__{(repeating)}
<D>__{neither snow, nor rain, nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{okay then.}
<C>__{ford}
<P>__{(repeating)}
<D>__{okay, then.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{no, no, no, i'm saying that. you just listen... by my authority you are now empowered to carry the mail.}
<P>__{(extends a hand)}
<D>__{congratulations, you're a postman.}
<A>__{they shake hands. the postman doesn't realize, but this is the most important moment in ford's life.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{i want you to know i'd die to get a letter through.}
<A>__{ford's intensity takes the postman back. but the moment is broken when...}
<C>__{briscoe }
<D>__{johnny, why don't you run along. i need to speak to this man.}
<A>__{ford bristles at "johnny," looks to the postman.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{i will see you around.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{sure thing, ford.}
<A>__{ford exits.}
<C>__{briscoe}
<D>__{johnny's real impressed with you. whole town's real impressed with you.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i take it you're not.}
<C>__{briscoe}
<D>__{smarter than you look.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{what can i do for you, sheriff?}
<C>__{briscoe}
<D>__{you can clear out. or i can throw you out. either way suits me fine.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i'm afraid you don't understand, sheriff. i'm a government employee. authorized by }
<C>__{briscoe}
<D>__{you're not authorized by shit. you're nothing but a drifter who found a bag of mail. and i want you out of my town.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{this is going in my report.}
<C>__{briscoe}
<D>__{these people don't need dreams, mr. postman. they need something real. they need help with the goddamn holnists. are you going to bring them that?}
<P>__{(as the postman doesn't answer)}
<D>__{didn't think so. all you cost us so far is a few bowls of soup and maybe later a few broken hearts. i aim to keep it that way. you can stay till morning. then i don't ever want to see you again.}
<A>__{briscoe exits, leaves the postman alone in the post office.}
