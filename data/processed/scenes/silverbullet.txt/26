<L>__{exterior tarker's mills town common day}
<A>__{the common is more or less in the center of town, either surrounded by main street commerce or backed by it. the camera moves slowly in on a big tent that's been erected on the common looks like a revival meeting tent, almost, but the banner draped over the entrance reads: support the tarker's mills medcu drive! behind or to the side, on the grass, picnic tables have been set out end to end. women are putting salads and home baked breads on these just about the whole town is going to sit down to a meal when the meeting's over. further off, men are tending barbecues, roasting corn, etc.}
