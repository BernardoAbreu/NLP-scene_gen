<L>__{interior mumford's office day}
<A>__{an overweight, teenage girl named nessa watkins is on mumford's couch. she fidgets as she talks and can't decide whether to lie down (so she's looking away from him) or sit up and face him. she plays with an unlit cigarette and keeps taking out a lighter, then stuffing it back in her big, sloppy handbag.}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{...so he already had the tattoo that said, "naomi forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. but while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets chandra. and it's serious, immediate love. so in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in north america.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{what do you mean, "in no time"?}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{in maybe three or four issues.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{weekly or monthly?}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{monthly! god, how shallow do you think brad is? why do i waste my time telling you this stuff?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{why do you think you tell me, nessa?}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{don't do that thing...}
<P>__{(mumford: what?)}
<D>__{...that shrink thing.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{it's a big part of the show.}
<A>__{she jams the cigarette in her mouth and flames the lighter, but is afraid to actually break his rules.}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{you really need to let people smoke in here, you know. it's perverse. what are they paying you to see me?}
<A>__{mumford indicates "nothing".}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{the school board doesn't pay you? what kind of deal is that?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{it's called pro bono.}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{pro boner?}
<P>__{(he waits her out)}
<D>__{pro bono, huh? for whose good, supposedly?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{it's my bit for the community.}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{fuck the community.}
<P>__{(he won't go for it)}
<D>__{there was this article my friends and i read. it was "25 signs he's great in bed". it was very fascinating.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{where was this?}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{where?... the new york times. the first one was "he handles produce well." which we already knew!}
<P>__{(an expression she uses)}
<D>__{the point is, you have a lot of the signs.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{you been spying on me in the supermarket, nessa?}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{have women found you attractive?}
<A>__{mumford laughs.}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{i knew you wouldn't answer. i've been thinking about what you said last time. how me trying to lose weight and constantly not is like a lot of people with addictions. how maybe i can't lose the weight, ever...}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{which we already knew...}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{that's not quite what i said }
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{it's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change that it'd be some kind of a relief or something...}
<A>__{mumford waits.}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{well, i guess i'm just a dumb bitch, but how depressing is that moment the moment when you give up?}
