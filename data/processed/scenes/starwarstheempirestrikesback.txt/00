<D>__{written by lawrence kasdan and leigh brackett from a story by george lucas}
<L>__{exterior galaxy planet hoth}
<A>__{a star destroyer moves through space, releasing imperial probe robots from its underside. one of these probes zooms toward the planet hoth and lands on its ice covered surface. an explosion marks the point of impact.}
<L>__{exterior hoth meteorite crater snow plain day}
<A>__{a weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind. a strange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the smoke shrouded crater. the ominous mechanical probe floats across the snow plain and disappears into the distance.}
<L>__{exterior plain of hoth day}
<A>__{a small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope. the bundled rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a tauntaun. curving plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two legged beast. the rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop. pulling off his protective goggles, luke skywalker notices something in the sky. he takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and through them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed. the wind whips at luke's fur lined cap and he activates a comlink transmitter. his tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him.}

<D>__{echo three to echo seven. han, old buddy, do you read me?}
<A>__{after a little static a familiar voice is heard.}
<C>__{han}
<P>__{(over comlink)}
<D>__{loud and clear, kid. what's up?}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(into comlink)}
<D>__{well, i finished my circle. i don't pick up any life readings.}
<C>__{han}
<P>__{(over comlink)}
<D>__{there isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. the sensors are placed, i'm going back.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(into comlink)}
<D>__{right. i will see you shortly. there's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. i want to check it out. it won't take long.}
<A>__{luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his nervous lizard. he pats the beast on the head to calm it.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{hey, steady girl. what's the matter? you smell something?}
<A>__{luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind. he hears a monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven foot tall shape towering over him. it is a wampa ice creature, lunging at him ferociously.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{aaargh!}
<A>__{luke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a huge white claw. he falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified screams of the tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck being broken. the wampa ice creature grabs luke by one ankle and drags him away across the frozen plain.}
