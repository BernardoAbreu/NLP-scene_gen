<A>__{marcie is the source of the scream. she runs towards the camera, dressed in cut offs and a floral halter. her feet are bare. when she get closer, we see that she is being chased by jack and ned who have found two giant green bullfrogs. the screams were not serious and marcie is doing some of it for effect. brenda brings up the rear. they are all dressed more or less for a frolic in the lake. bill and alice stand in front of the arts & crafts cabin. bill is smiling, alice is a little bit amused.}
