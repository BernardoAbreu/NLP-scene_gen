<L>__{interior colin's condo night}
<A>__{unpacked boxes are stacked everywhere. classical music plays on the stereo. colin, now in sweats and a t shirt, examines abby's ankle.}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{you're a doctor?}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{an orthopedic surgeon.}
<A>__{she glances around the room and sees a bottle of red wine and a half empty wine glass sitting on a table.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{i do a lot of leg and hip stuff but i do get the occasional foot. you seem to be fine. no sprain.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{well, i guess i'm pretty lucky d'artagnan picked your tree to climb. dave in the next unit over sells lawn furniture. i don't know that i would have been as confident with his diagnosis.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{i'm here whenever you need me.}
<A>__{abby puts on her shoes as colin opens his wallet and hands her a card.}
<C>__{colin }
<D>__{my home number's on the back. if the ankle starts giving you problems, just give me a call.}
<A>__{colin picks up the cat, who starts purring.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{wow, he doesn't usually like men.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{dogs are great, but...well, you're a cat person. you know.}
<A>__{abby looks at him, nodding. delighted at his complete and utter perfection.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{well, i guess i should get going now.}
<A>__{she remains rooted to her spot. he waits a beat then, feeling awkward, makes a move to open the door.}
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{thanks again for saving me.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{any time.}
<A>__{she walks out and colin closes the door. realizing that he still has the cat in his arms, he opens the door to find abby doing a spazzy happy dance. startled, she quickly composes herself.}
<C>__{colin }
<D>__{you forgot your cat.}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(re the dance)}
<D>__{oh. thanks. there was a spider. on me. but it's gone now.}
<A>__{he chuckles, hands her d'artagnan.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{he closes the door.}
