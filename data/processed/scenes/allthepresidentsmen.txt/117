<B>__{the budget meeting}
<C>__{simons}
<D>__{ ok, last go round. foreign, anything else?}
<A>__{the foreign editor, an enormously thoughtful looking and respected man, indicates "no."}
<C>__{simons}
<P>__{(to another editor)}
<D>__{national?}
<C>__{national editor}
<D>__{i will stand with the eagleton follow ups and mcgovern not being able to get a replacement that's your page one stuff right there, howard }
<C>__{simons}
<D>__{ metropolitan? }
<C>__{rosenfeld}
<D>__{ you are ignoring the importance of the dahlberg repercussions }
<C>__{national editor}
<D>__{ nobody gives a shit about the dahlberg repercussions }
<C>__{rosenfeld}
<P>__{(to national editor)}
<D>__{ quit equivocating, say what you mean }
<P>__{(to simons and bradlee)}
<D>__{ our story got government accounting to start an audit on creep's finances }
<C>__{bradlee}
<D>__{ and we printed that, didn't we, harry? and when the frigging audit's done, we'll print that too }
<C>__{national editor}
<D>__{ let me tell what happened when i was having lunch today at the sans souci }
<C>__{rosenfeld}
<D>__{ correction when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the sans souci }
<C>__{national editor}
<D>__{ this white house guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this watergate compulsion with you guys and i said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are woodward and bernstein?}
<C>__{rosenfeld}
<D>__{ask him what he's really saying he means take the story away from woodstein and give it to his people at the national desk }
<C>__{national editor}
<D>__{ well, i've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so? }
<C>__{rosenfeld}
<D>__{ absolutely and that's all they do, sit sit sit every once in a while, they call up a senator, some reporting }
<C>__{national editor}
<D>__{ well, what if your boys get it wrong }
<C>__{bradlee}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{then it's our asses, isn't it?}
<C>__{simons}
<P>__{(indicates the meeting is over)}
<D>__{and we'll all have to go to work for a living.}
<A>__{as the men rise and head for the door, the foreign editor moves toward bradlee and simons who remain seated as before.}
<C>__{foreign editor}
<D>__{i don't think either metropolitan or national should cover the story.}
<P>__{(bradlee and simons look at him)}
<D>__{i don't think we should cover the story, period.}
<C>__{bradlee}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{foreign editor}
<D>__{it's not that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me, or that everything we print the white house denies, or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff.}
<C>__{simons}
<D>__{what then?}
<C>__{foreign editor}
<D>__{i don't believe the goddamn story, howard, it doesn't make sense.}
<C>__{bradlee}
<D>__{it will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.}
<C>__{foreign editor}
<D>__{ben, jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on watergate? where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?}
<A>__{bradlee and simons say nothing. they respect this guy.}
<C>__{foreign editor}
<D>__{look why would the republicans do it? my god, mcgovern is self destructing before our eyes just like muskie did, humphrey, the bunch of 'em.}
<P>__{(sits on the table, talks quietly on)}
<D>__{why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught? why did they take a walkie talkie and then turn it off, unless they wanted to get caught? why would they use mccord the only direct contact to the republicans?}
<C>__{bradlee}
<D>__{you saying the democrats bugged themselves?}
<C>__{foreign editor}
<D>__{the fbi thinks it's possible the democrats need a campaign issue, corruption's always a good one.}
<P>__{(rises, starts out)}
<D>__{get off the story, ben or put some people on mcgovern's finances; fair is fair, even in our business.}
<A>__{he leaves. bradlee and simons stay where they are, both of them flattened by what the guy's said. because they're not sure he's wrong... hold. now }
