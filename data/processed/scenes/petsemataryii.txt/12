<L>__{15 exterior house day}
<A>__{lazy oaks embrace a vintage, two story victorian home in the rural neighborhood of ludlow, maine. a commercial moving van is parked out front. marjorie, the girl we saw at renee's funeral, is coming down the sidewalk. she checks the address on the front of the house, then heads up the driveway.}
<L>__{interior downstairs hallway}
<A>__{moving boxes clutter the downstairs. chase is weaving through the maze, doing an inventory on the boxes. a sweaty pair of movers are climbing up the stairs. each is hunched over, with a garment box balanced on his back. the side of each carton is boldly labeled: renee attic.}
<C>__{mover }
<D>__{we've got six more of these. you sure you want them all in the attic?}
<A>__{chase is contemplating a compromise when geoff appears from the kitchen doorway.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{...geoff, what if we just give the clothes to goodwill? we'll keep the rest. just the clothes.}
<A>__{geoff shakes his head, firm and deliberate denial.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{you're the one who wanted to move. nobody would've touched them if you didn't want to move here...}
<A>__{chase weakens, giving in.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{all the 'renee' boxes go in the attic. sorry.}
<A>__{marjorie knocks on the open frame of the front door. geoff recognizes her from his mother's funeral. she flashes him a warm smile.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{hi. i'm marjorie hargrove. your new housekeeper.}
<A>__{marjorie has a naive, friendly quality about her. she's also blessed with eye popping genetics. standing there outside the door, looking more than a little nervous... we can't help but like her. needless to say, she doesn't look like your typical housekeeper.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<P>__{(re: chase's reaction)}
<D>__{is something wrong?}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{uh... no. you just... look different than you sounded on the phone. please, come in.}
<A>__{marjorie enters. she grins at geoff again. yep. she's nervous alright.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{i'm real excited about working for you mr. matthews...}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{well we're glad to have you, marjorie. you can call me chase, by the way.}
<A>__{marjorie passes her curious eyes over one of renee's garment containers.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{i've always admired ms. hallow. that scene she did in blue midnight, where her lover meets her at the train station...}
<P>__{(she sighs)}
<D>__{i must've watched that movie four times.}
<A>__{chase smiles. marjorie's enthusiasm is endearing. just then, one of the movers loses his grip. a garment box bounces down the slope of the stairs. when it reaches the bottom, dresses spill over the floor.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{oh. i will get that...}
<A>__{marjorie moves for the spill. the first dress she touches is a beaded peach evening gown. her fingers linger on the fabric.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{this is gorgeous. she wore this at the emmys, didn't she?}
<A>__{geoff moves forward, acting overly defensive.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{hey, don't touch her stuff. it made her crazy when people touched her stuff.}
<A>__{marjorie is taken aback by the oddity of geoff's statement. chase catches her eye, shrugging apologetically.}
