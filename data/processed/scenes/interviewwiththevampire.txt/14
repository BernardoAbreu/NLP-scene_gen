<L>__{exterior plantation night}
<A>__{lestat and louis walk through the slave quarters, huddles groups around fires, music, singing. the sound of whipping is heard.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{your grief has unhinged you. you've let your estate rot.}
<A>__{in the woods beyond the quarters, the white overseer is whipping a black slave, with horrifying savagery.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. we'll start with him.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{how do you mean, start?}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{call him.}
<A>__{louis calls.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{carlos!!!}
<A>__{the overseer turns and comes towards them, with the bloodied whip.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{why the bloody whip, carlos?}
<A>__{the overseer looks into his eyes, shivers with terror, drops the whip and runs for the trees. lestat is on him in an instant. he sinks is teeth in his neck. louis runs to him, tries to pull him off. but lestat turns to louis and smiles, with his bloodied mouth.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{let's call that a start.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i can't do it.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you've just done it }
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{kill me if you will, but i can't do this...}
<A>__{he flees, as lestat ends to finish off the overseer.}
