<D>__{what do you think? good move?}

<C>__{bella}
<D>__{good decision. all actresses are mad as snakes.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{tony what do you think?}

<A>__{bella is casually looking at the painting that sits beside william. it is the original of the chagall, the poster of which was on his wall.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{this painting isn't the original, is it?}
<C>__{william}

<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{that's nice.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{it was sort of sweet actually i mean, i know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line but she said that she might be as famous as can be but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.}
<A>__{they take in the line. it totally reverses their attitudes. a pause.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{oh sod a dog. i've made the wrong decision, haven't i?}
<A>__{they look at him. spike does a big nod.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{max, how fast is your car?}
