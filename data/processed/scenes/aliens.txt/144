<A>__{entering the darkened chamber, ripley looks around. newt is nowhere to be seen. on a hunch she kneels down and peers under the bed. newt is curled up there, jammed as far back as she can get, fast asleep. still clutching "casey." ripley stares at newt's tiny face, so angelic despite the demons that have chased her through her dreams and the reality between dreams. ripley lays the rifle on top of the cot and crawls carefully underneath. without waking the little girl, she slips her arms around her. ripley becomes merely the larger of two children huddling together in the darkness under their bed. newt's face contorts with the externalization of some tormented dreamscape. she cries out, a vague inarticulate plea. ripley rocks her gently.}
