<D>__{like you care.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{i do care. but i'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .}

<D>__{i wish i had that luxury. i'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and i can't go, because you won ' t.}
<A>__{kat clears her throat}
<C>__{kat}

<C>__{kat}
<P>__{(self mocking)}
<D>__{he was, like, a total babe}

<D>__{but you hate joey}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{now i do. back then, was a different story.}
<C>__{bianca}
<D>__{as in...}
<A>__{kat takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{he said everyone was doing it. so i did it.}
<C>__{bianca}
<D>__{you did what?}
<C>__{kat}
<P>__{(continuing on)}
<D>__{just once. afterwards, i told him i didn't want to anymore. i wasn't ready. he got pissed. then he broke up with me.}
<A>__{bianca stares at her, dumbfounded}
<C>__{bianca}
<D>__{but}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{after that, i swore i'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it. and i haven't since. except for bogey's party, and my stunning gastro intestinal display }
<C>__{bianca}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{why didn't you tell me?}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{i wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.}
<C>__{bianca}
<D>__{no. you didn't! if you really thought i could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping daddy hold me hostage.}
<A>__{kat stands up slowly}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{that's not}
<C>__{bianca}
<D>__{i'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{i guess i thought i was protecting you.}
<C>__{bianca}
<D>__{god, you're just like him! just keep me locked away in the dark, so i can't experience anything for myself}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{not all experiences are good, bianca. you can't always trust the people you want to.}
<C>__{bianca}
<D>__{i guess i will never know, will i?}
<A>__{she rises and holds the door open for kat, then slams it behind her.}
