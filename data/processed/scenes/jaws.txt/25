<L>__{interior council chamber day}
<A>__{the crowd is thronging into the large room. already in the room is a solitary figure, standing all the way in the rear, watching everyone as they enter. against the back wall is a large blackboard used for town business during meetings.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{well, here we all are; anyone have any special questions?}
<C>__{denherder}
<D>__{is that $3000 bounty on the shark in cash or check?}
<P>__{(laughter from all)}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{that's private business between you brave fishermen and mrs. kintner.}
<P>__{(to brody)}
<D>__{ chief }
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(stepping in)}
<D>__{i'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. these are some of the steps i've taken as chief of police...}
<C>__{meadows}
<P>__{(leading the direction of the discussion)}
<D>__{what's going on with the beaches, chief?}
<A>__{all react.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i will get to that in a minute. first, i plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. i'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and i've also contacted the oceanographic institute over on the mainland.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<P>__{(interrupting sotto voice to brody)}
<D>__{no need to involve outsiders in our business, martin.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{are you going to close the beaches?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{larry and i have also decided to close the beaches for a short time.}
<A>__{pandemonium. a collective nerve has been touched.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{only 24 hours!}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i didn't agree to that!}
<C>__{mrs. taft}
<D>__{that official business could take all summer!}
<C>__{mr. keisel}
<D>__{maybe it's better to close.}
<A>__{two opinions have been expressed, and the crowd takes sides vociferously, ad libbing assent or dissent depending on the point of view held forth.}
<B>__{those in favor}
<C>__{mr. wiseman}
<D>__{we should make sure there is no danger.}
<C>__{mr. hassett}
<D>__{i didn't raise my kids to be some fish's lunch!}
<B>__{those opposed}
<C>__{mrs. taft}
<D>__{the motel is all i own you pull the plug on this town and i go down the drain with it.}
<C>__{mr. posner}
<D>__{nobody's seen a shark.}
<C>__{mr. polk}
<D>__{we'll lose business, we lose taxes, we lose our shirts!}
<A>__{angle on quint, the man in the back of the room he has just run his large, coarse fingernails over the blackboard. he is a large, rough man, a professional fisherman marked by daily physical toil, about 45 or 50, it's hard to tell where the scars leave off and the wrinkles begin. there is a bit of the showman in him, as well as a bit of killer whale.}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(after taking a deep breath)}
<D>__{you all know me. you know what i do for a living. i will go out and get this bird for you. he's a bad one and it's not like goin' down the pond chasing blue gills and tommy cods. this is a fish that can swallow a man whole. a little shakin', a little tenderizing and down ya' go.}
<P>__{(a look to vaughn)}
<D>__{you gotta get this fellow and get him quick. if you do, it'll bring a lot of tourist business just to see him and you've got your business back on a paying basis.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{a shark of that size is no pleasure and i value my neck at a hell of a lot more'n 3,000 bucks.}
<P>__{(a deadly look)}
<D>__{i will find him for three. but i will kill him for ten.}
<A>__{crowd reaction.}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(he rises up)}
<D>__{the bastard is costing you more'n that every day. do you wanna stay alive and annee up the ten or play it cheap and be on welfare next winter.}
<P>__{(a final moment)}
<D>__{i'm gonna kill this thing... just a matter of whether i do it now or at the end of summer.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{thank you very much, mr. quint, the selectmen will take your offer under advisement}
