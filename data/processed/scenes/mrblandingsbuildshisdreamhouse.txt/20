<L>__{interior the blandings' breakfast nook day}
<A>__{narrow and small. the four blandings are at breakfast, jim and muriel each reading his section of the morning paper, betsy pasting a clipping in her notebook, joan engrossed in a magazine of popular science. as we come in, gussie, taking off the orange juice, is squeezing by jim who accordingly and automatically ducks his head as she passes. jim uncomfortably turns the newspaper to another page, folds it, reacts with pained but controlled exasperation.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{...who did this?}
<A>__{insert newspaper, a section of which has been cut out.}
<B>__{back to scene.}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(very matter of factly)}
<D>__{i did.}
<A>__{she holds out her hand to joan, who, automatically, and without looking up hands her the salt.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i have repeatedly told you }
<P>__{(ducking as gussie comes back with coffee)}
<D>__{ don't cut up the morning paper until i've had a chance to look at it!}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{i'm sorry, father. it's necessary research.}
<A>__{she hands the salt back to joan who automatically passes it to muriel.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(with some sarcasm)}
<D>__{i suppose this is another of miss stellwagon's so called progressive projects?}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(using salt and handing it to jim)}
<D>__{now dear, there just isn't any point in sending your children to an expensive school if you're going to undermine the teacher's authority in your own dining room.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i'm not undermining anything. i happen to be in the advertising business and keeping abreast of the times is important to me.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{and so is your children's education.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{that's not the pointerior}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{it certainly is.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{it certainly is not!}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(without looking up from her magazine)}
<D>__{bicker, bicker, bicker.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you eat your cornflakes!}
<A>__{jim ducks as gussie passes back on her way to the kitchen.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(handing joan toast)}
<D>__{joan, every time your father and i have a lively discussion we aren't necessarily bickering.}
<P>__{(to betsy; solicitously)}
<D>__{what is it, dear, another english composition?}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(taking toast from joan)}
<D>__{miss stellwagon has assigned each of us to take a want ad and write a human interest theme about it.}
<P>__{(to jim; passing toast to him)}
<D>__{i found one typical of the disintegration of our present society.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(taking toast, not}
<D>__{looking up from his}
<P>__{paper)}
<D>__{i wasn't aware of the fact that our society was disintegrating.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{i didn't expect you to be, father. miss stellwagon says that middle class people like us are all too prone to overlook the pressures and tensions which befall the less fortunate members of our community.}
<A>__{jim puts down the paper, turns to muriel.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(with great restraint)}
<D>__{muriel, i know it's asking a lot, but just one morning i would like to sit down and have breakfast without social significance!}
<A>__{picks up his paper.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{jim, you really might take a little more interest in your children's education.}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(without looking up)}
<D>__{you can't squeeze blood from a turnip.}
<A>__{jim reacts with painful resignation, folds his arms, puts down the paper, turns slowly to betsy.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{all right. all right. i will listen.}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(picking up her scrapbook)}
<D>__{it's just twenty four words. but in simple eloquence it mirrors a minor tragedy of our times.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{well?...}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"forced to sell. farm dwelling, oak grove, apple orchard, trout stream, hay fields, four barns, seclusion, superb view, original beams, paved highway, acreage...}
<P>__{(with emotion)}
<D>__{will sacrifice..."}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{that's all.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{that's all?!}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{you don't see it, do you, father?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{no. fellow wants to sell a house so he puts an ad in the paper. what did you expect him to do, take it to the united nations!}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{there must be more to it than that.}
<P>__{(to betsy)}
<D>__{isn't there, dear?}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{certainly, mother. what some people don't see is the whole sordid picture. a poor, honest farmer, pushed to the wall by hardship, soil erosion, mortgages, everybody gobbling, gobbling, gobbling, until finally, in desperation, he is "forced to sell," and stoops to the crass commercialism of newspaper advertising.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(muttering)}
<D>__{oh, indeed... crass commercialism... advertising...}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(nose in her magazine)}
<D>__{miss stellwagon says advertising is a basically parasitic profession.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(with extreme control)}
<D>__{oh, she does?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{miss stellwagon says that advertising makes people who can't afford it buy things they don't want with money they haven't got.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(elaborate sarcasm)}
<D>__{perhaps your miss stellwagon is right. perhaps i ought to get out of this "basically parasitic profession," which at the moment is paying for her very fancy tuition, those extra french lessons, her progressive summer camp and for that matter, the very braces on your teeth!}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{i wish you wouldn't discuss money in front of the children.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{why not, they spend enough of it!}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{bicker, bicker, bicker.}
<A>__{as jim gives her a look and buries himself in his paper, the downstairs buzzer rings. gussie enters, squeezes by jim who automatically ducks, goes to the phone in b.g.}
<C>__{gussie}
<D>__{hello. who?}
<P>__{(calls)}
<D>__{miss blandings, there's a mr. funkhauser wants to see you.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{funkhauser?}
<P>__{(remembers)}
<D>__{oh, mr. funkhauser!}
<C>__{gussie}
<D>__{that's what he says.}
<A>__{muriel looks nervously at jim who is preoccupied, reading his paper. then she turns back to gussie.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{uh better ask him to come up.}
<C>__{gussie}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{says to come up.}
<A>__{gussie hangs up, squeezes by jim, exits into the kitchen. pause.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(tentatively)}
<D>__{oh uh darling, mr. funkhauser's here.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{...who?}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{you remember, bunny funkhauser, that clever young interior decorator we met at the collins' cocktail party?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(distastefully)}
<D>__{what's he doing here?}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{well, i imagine he's brought the uh estimates.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(blankly)}
<D>__{...estimates?}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(rapidly; to conceal a feeling of guilt)}
<D>__{darling, you know how long we've said we've got to do something about this apartment, and, well, he called last week, and i had him come over, and he's got some simply wonderful ideas!}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{there couldn't be two bunny funkhausers, could there?}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{why, no, dear.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{then this is the same clever young man who's responsible for that zebra striped monstrosity in the collins' living room?}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{that couch is terribly functional.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{phil collins told me what he paid for all that function!}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{if you think i'm going to }
<A>__{sound of doorbell ringing.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{darling, please!}
<P>__{(changing subject)}
<D>__{children, you'll be late to school. run along and }
<A>__{the children rise, pick up their school paraphernalia.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{miss stellwagon says that functionalism in modern furniture }
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{never mind, dear.}
<A>__{she hustles betsy and joan toward the foyer as jim rises.}
