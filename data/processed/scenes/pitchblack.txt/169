<L>__{exterior night}
<A>__{into a rising wind, the survivors range on. audrey now carries paris' torch, refueled and coughing fireballs at regular intervals. fry seems to be handling rear point fairly well, until... the cutter sputters and dies. she ditches it and takes the torch from audrey.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{bottle count.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{four fulls, one half. that mean we're halfway there? i hope?}
<A>__{good question. they've just been blindly following... the light on riddick's back.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{can we pick up the pace?}
<A>__{working like a mule, johns growls to himself. "if you think you can do better...." abruptly he slaps an arm across imam's chest, spotting... a sled track. in front of them. fry hears a shotgun ratchet. she spins to see... johns out of his chains. moving forward. jamming the shotgun into the back of riddick's neck.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{we aren't completely stupid.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{stay in the light! everybody! stay in the fucking }
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{we crossed our own tracks.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{he's running us 'round in circles. look for yourself. look!}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{riddick? what the hell are you }
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{listen .}
<A>__{imagine a hundred geiger counters next to a truckload of plutonium. that's the sound that rides the wind now.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{canyon ahead. i circled once to buy some time to think.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{think about what?}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{about how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!}
<C>__{riddick}
<P>__{(answering fry)}
<D>__{about the girl.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{what about her?}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{what it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. with her bleeding.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{what're you jaw jackin' about? girl's not cut.}
<C>__{riddick}
<P>__{(agreeing)}
<D>__{no. she's not.}
<A>__{it hits fry like a two by four. she looks at audrey.}
<C>__{audrey}
<P>__{(confessing)}
<D>__{i didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why i didn't say anything....}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{no, we'd never....oh, god, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.}
<C>__{johns}
<P>__{(finally getting it)}
<D>__{aw, this can't be happening to me....}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{they been nose open for her ever since we left. they go off blood.}
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{well...we must keep her close, then. here, she'll be safe if we put her between }
<C>__{riddick}
<P>__{(scanning)}
<D>__{there is no "safe."}
<A>__{an epic beat. the wind gusts...the flames chatter...their ears fill with canyon sounds.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{it's not gonna work. we gotta go back.}
<A>__{johns brays.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{hey, you're the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. an' now you 'spect me to go back like a whipped dog?}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{i was wrong. i admit it. my bad, okay? now let's just go back to the ship.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{i dunno. nice breeze, wide open spaces you know, i'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{are you fucking high again? just listen to }
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{no, no, you're right, fry. what's to be afraid of? my life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. so i say mush on! canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in skiff city! so why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get }
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{she's the captain, we should listen to }
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{listen to her? her ? when she was willing to sacrifice us all?}
<A>__{a beat. eyes turn to fry. she wants to protest but can't.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{what's he talkin' about?}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{during the crash, she }
<C>__{fry}
<P>__{(a warning growl)}
<D>__{this does not help us, johns.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{ she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us }
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{just shut up, okay?}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{ tried to kill us in our sleep. paris had it right we are disposable. we're just walking ghosts to her.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{would you rag your stupid hole!}
<A>__{she rushes him, ready to rip his eyes out. he shunts her aside.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{we're not alive because of her we're alive in spite of her.}
<A>__{he swung below the belt and connected. fry's chin quakes, her knees fail. the undertow of events finally pulls her down.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{we cannot go through there....}
<C>__{johns}
<P>__{(lording)}
<D>__{how much you weigh right now, fry? huh?}
<C>__{imam}
<P>__{(pushing him back)}
<D>__{fine, fine, you've made your pointerior we can all be so scared as you.}
<A>__{johns snatches a light away from imam.}
<C>__{johns}
<P>__{(to all)}
<D>__{verdict's in. the light moves forward.}
