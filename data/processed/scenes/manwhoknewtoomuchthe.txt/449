<A>__{the three of them enter the 'green room', generally used by the principal artistes appearing at royal albert hall. buchanan nods to two special branch men who are standing about in case they are needed. the room is informal containing arm chairs, a sofa and a number of small tables. jo sits down wearily into the nearest chair. ben remains standing, buchanan takes a seat in a chair near a telephone, he looks up at ben as if he expects him to say something. ben responds to the look.}
