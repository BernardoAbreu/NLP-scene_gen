<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{sandro leaves the store. he walks a few steps along the pavement, then sits down at a small outside table of a nearby caf. he looks out over the square: a small sicilian town, quiet and still in the hot afternoon sun. every now and then, he glances up at the country road that winds around the town, as though he were waiting for someone. a few moments later, in fact, a car comes into view and slows down as it reaches the square. the driver looks out for a place in which to park. sandro rises to his feet. the car comes to a stop a few steps away from him. the driver rushes out of the car to open the door for the person inside: it is claudia. sandro immediately goes over to meet her, looking at her somewhat amazed. not only does he see her more elegantly dressed than he has ever seen her before, wearing a smartly tailored polka dot suit, but also as an entirely new person, as someone whose beauty he has discovered for the first time. for a moment they continue staring at each other, without even bothering to say hello.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{any news?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{yes... but it's all so conflicting... however, there is some slight indication...}
<A>__{claudia drops her gaze, relieved by even that slight note of hope. then she looks up at him again, as though inspired by another sudden thought: something which must have lingered in her mind from one of the princess' humorous quips. then, the owner of the general store appears on the scene. after having dealt his nagging wife a crushing verbal blow, he turns to sandro, but not without first glancing at claudia, for whom it soon becomes evident he has really come out on the street.}
<C>__{husband}
<D>__{listen... in the paper they forgot to say that as soon as the girl left here she took the bus to noto. the bus leaves from the square, over there. i saw her clearly... i came to the door to see her off... she was a beautiful girl. lovely pair of legs!}
<A>__{while speaking, he continues to keep an eye on claudia with the look of one who thinks his gaze is loaded with irresistible masculinity. all of a sudden, he pulls out a package of nazionali cigarettes from his pocket and offers one to claudia. she looks at him dumbfounded, then automatically declines with a shake of her head. in turn, he lights up a cigarette, inhaling the smoke voluptuously. meanwhile, his wife has come upon the scene and looks at him suspiciously. then, with a sad, wistful voice, she turns to claudia.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{you're from rome, aren't you? i knew right away because i'm from viterbo... he was a soldier there and so...}
<P>__{(indicating her husband, and then quickly continuing)}
<D>__{i don't like it very much, here.}
<C>__{husband}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{then why don't you go back?}
<A>__{his wife turns and looks at him hatefully, exactly in the same manner he had looked at her.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{how long have you been married?}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{three months.}
<A>__{claudia and sandro look at each other. there is a moment of embarrassment, then sandro breaks the silence.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{well... thanks for the information.}
<A>__{they exchange goodbyes, then claudia and sandro move away from the store and head towards claudia's car. suddenly, sandro takes claudia by the hand.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{it's better if we present a happy picture, no?}
<A>__{claudia is about to withdraw her hand but she is taken aback by sandro's phrase, which also fills her with a warm and tender feeling after the squalid situation with the young storekeeper and his wife. now sandro opens the door of the car, looks at claudia as if to ask her consent for what he is about to do, and since claudia says nothing but just stands there trying to figure out which one of the feelings struggling within her will win, he removes claudia's valise and closes the door.}
<C>__{sandro}
<P>__{(to the driver)}
<D>__{tell the signora patrizia that we are continuing the search...and that the signorina claudia will manage to survive somehow...}
<A>__{the driver bows slightly, then he climbs into the car and departs. sandro and claudia remain there, watching the car disappear out of view. now sandro turns to look at claudia, and smiles at her. claudia is visibly upset. she doesn't smile back but merely turns away and heads towards sandro's car.}
