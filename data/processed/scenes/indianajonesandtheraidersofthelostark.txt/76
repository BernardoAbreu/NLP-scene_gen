<A>__{indy is down the twenty feet to the floor of the room in seconds. he tugs on the rope and it immediately gets pulled up. indy looks around with real wonder and excitement. the room is lovely, with elaborate wall carvings and frescoes, all lit by the bright stream of sunlight flooding in from above. this beam of light leads indy's eye to the far end, and the room's truly remarkable feature: built into the floor in meticulous relief is a miniature stone model of the ancient city of tanis. already, the sunlight has worked its way down the far wall and is edging onto the miniature of the city. on the floor, to the skylight side of the miniature, is an elaborate line created by embedded mosaic tiles. the evenly spaced slots in the line, each accompanied by a symbol of a time of year, are for the base of the staff. indy pulls the headpiece from his robes it has been welded together and reaches for the staff.}
