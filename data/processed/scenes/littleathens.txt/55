<L>__{exterior aaron's house continuous}
<A>__{aaron is out the front door, yelling at jessica who is further down the street.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{where you goin', bitch?!}
<A>__{jessica runs to carlos's car, opens the door, throws the novel in and jumps in after it. she throws on her seatbelt and rifles through her purse, looking for her pepper spray.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{drive!}
<C>__{carlos}
<P>__{(starting the car)}
<D>__{what's the deal?}
<A>__{aaron, holding a rock slightly bigger than his fist, smashes the passenger side window.}
<C>__{carlos }
<D>__{what the fuck!}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{fucking drive!}
<A>__{aaron reaches in and grabs jessica's hair and begins to rip her out of the car, cutting his own arm while doing so. aaron growls, more in anger than pain, as he yanks with all his might. jessica is holding onto the inside of the passenger door with one hand, and is scratching and clawing at aaron to get aaron to release her with her other hand. jessica's seat belt clearly is the only thing keeping her in the car. carlos is pulling away slowly. aaron releases one hand from jessica's hair and punches at the top of her head.}
<C>__{jessica }
<D>__{fuck you!}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{fuck you, you filthy fuckin' whore!}
<A>__{aaron repeatedly tries to hit jessica with his free hand as carlos pulls into the street. aaron runs along with the car. jessica reaches toward aaron with a closed fist, where she is holding her pepper spray. she sprays at aaron but misses. aaron grabs at her fist with his free hand and rips the pepper spray from jessica. jessica screams in pain as aaron sprays away.}
<C>__{aaron }
<D>__{you like that, bitch?! huh?!}
<A>__{carlos swerves violently to the side towards a parked car along the side of the road. aaron is plowed along toward the car, but releases jessica at the last possible second, just avoiding a collision with the car. carlos was not fooling around. aaron watches them tear down the street before he about faces and walks briskly back toward the house, where troy is standing on the front porch watching the action.}
