<L>__{interior mess room dawn}
<A>__{the entire complement of the ship gathers for an emergency meeting. janek at the head of the hall. glasse, downs, brick, stillwell, and kamarov seated with pistols on their hips. to one side: vickers with captain shepherd and vigoda.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{all right! listen up. i expect you all know what...}
<A>__{watts enters. they all stare at her, knowing what she's been through. with averted eyes she crosses the room. sits alone.}
<C>__{janek }
<D>__{we've got some kind of parasite aboard ship.}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{i suggest you kill it.}
<C>__{downs}
<D>__{there's a bright idea.}
<C>__{kamarov}
<D>__{show us where it is, lady. we just spent five hours looking for the damn thing.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{we found engineers who died like martin.}
<A>__{silence. they all turn to look at her.}
<C>__{watts }
<D>__{explosive wounds in the chest. whatever killed martin is the same thing that killed the engineers a thousand years ago.}
<C>__{stillwell}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{but not all the engineers died that way. the others were torn apart. slashed to pieces.}
<A>__{a murmur among the men as the implications of that sink in. even vickers is disconcerted.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{we're a modular ship. self contained life support and power in every section. i say put the ship in orbit. vent every compartment to space. sit in vacuum at twenty degrees kelvin for a week. kill anything.}
<C>__{downs}
<D>__{then what?}
<C>__{stillwell}
<D>__{straight home, man.}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{this ship doesn't lift until our work's done.}
<A>__{she joins janek at the head of the room. shepherd and vigoda flank her, rifles slung. the soldiers scan the room, meeting each man's eyes. the quiet threat is unmistakable.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{are you serious?}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{we spent years and billions of dollars getting here. the technology we came for is in our hands. we just need a little more time.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{we're barely here three days and three men dead!}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{they were careless.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{careless!}
<A>__{as the argument picks up heat, watts slips out of the room.}
<C>__{excursion chamber}
<A>__{watts, in a space suit, no helmet, opens holloway's locker. she pulls out the space suit he wore on the last day of his life. holloway stenciled on the chest. her fingers linger in its folds as if she could soak up some last trace of him. she pulls the tracking chip from the chestplate of his suit. plugs the chip into a map unit. the holographic map lights up. the legend in the corner reads martin holloway. a wandering path shows holloway's final exploration. markers on the map denote his photographs, field notes and scans. watts touches a marker. one of holloway's field notes plays:}
<C>__{holloway }
<P>__{(filtered)}
<D>__{seven dead engineers all facing the same way. going where? jocelyn's right, we don't see the big picture yet. another level below me. i'm going down.}
<C>__{service corridor}
<A>__{a hunting party convenes: card and vigoda in combat coveralls with submachine guns; downs, kamarov and stillwell wearing tool belts and pistols. the soldiers carry map units, squinting at the plan of the unfamiliar ship: decks upon decks.}
<C>__{card}
<D>__{vigoda, take kamarov and work the number one accessway. i will work number three with downs and stillwell.}
<C>__{downs}
<P>__{(rebellious)}
<D>__{you in charge now?}
<C>__{card}
<D>__{tactical op.}
<C>__{kamarov}
<D>__{yeah, well, stillwell's the ventilation specialist, and life support's that way. downs is electrics and the regulators are that way.}
<A>__{vigoda grins wryly. card glowers. they switch corridors.}
