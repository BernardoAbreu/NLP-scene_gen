<D>__{what i really learned from the charlie debacle is that you gotta punch your weight. charlie was out of my class: too pretty, too smart, too witty, too much. what am i? average. a middleweight. not the smartest guy in the world, but certainly not the dumbest. i've read books like the unbearable lightness of being, angela's ashes, and love in the time of cholera, and understood them, i think they're about girls, right? just kidding but i don't like them very much. my all time top five favorite books are johnny cash's autobiography, snow crash by neil stevenson, zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance, the trouser press guides to rock, and, i don't know, probably something by kurt vonnegut. i look through the new yorker when my neighbor's done with it, and i'm not averse to going down to the fine arts to watch subtitles films, although on the whole i prefer american films. top five being blade runner, cool hand luke, the first two godfathers which we'll count as one, taxi driver, and the shining. i'm okay looking, average height, not skinny, not fat. my genius, if i can call it that, is to combine a whole load of averageness into one compact frame. you might say there were millions like me, but there aren't, really: alot of guys have impeccable music taste but don't read, alot of guys read but are really fat, alot of guys are sympathetic to women but have stupid beards, alot of guys have a woody allen sense of humor but look like woody allen. some drink too much, some drive like assholes, some get into fights, or show off money, or do drugs. i don't do any of these things, really. if i do okay with women it's not because of the virtues i have, but because of the ugly flaws i don't have... so. charlie and i didn't match. after her i was determined to never get out of my league again.}
