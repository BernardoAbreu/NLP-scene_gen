<A>__{needy runs toward her mom's car, a beat up kia parked on the curb. she climbs into the car and starts the ignition, trembling and crying. she pulls out onto the street and guns it. she swings a hard left. the streets are all almost identical, lined by working class homes. she turns on the radio. the song is, of course, "through the trees" by soft shoulder. she pounds the dashboard, hysterical.}

<A>__{needy seizes the wheel drives recklessly down a dark, tree lined street. then, she sees something bright emerge from the shadows. her eyes widen... it's jennifer, creeping toward the curb like an animal. she's pale in the moonlight. the entire lower half of her face is covered in blood, like a ghoulish beard of gore. she flashes a huge, deranged, toothy smile at needy. needy screams and swerves. the car fishtails out of control and slides into a ditch. needy slams her foot onto the accelerator, trying to get out of the trench. she glances desperately out the side window. jennifer is gone. panting, needy tries to accelerate again. suddenly, jennifer appears from out of nowhere and slams her body against the windshield, her long limbs splayed like an insect's. the windshield shatters. jennifer grins at needy through the cracking glass. needy screams again, puts the pedal to the floor, and manages to rear up out of the ditch. jennifer's body tumbles off the car as needy goes roaring down the street.}
