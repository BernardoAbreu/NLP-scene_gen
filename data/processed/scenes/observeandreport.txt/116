<L>__{interior ronnie's bedroom day night}
<A>__{ronnie lies in his bed and we... time lapse: the sun rises and sets three times through the window of his bedroom, signifying that three days have passed. the whole time, ronnie doesn't move from his bed. until... ronnie gets on his "nice" clothes, but they're a far cry from his security guard uniform. ronnie's mom comes up to him.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{what's on the agenda for today?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i guess maybe look for a job or something.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{well, i know you're sad about it, but try to look on the bright side.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{there is no bright side. my life is over.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{ronnie, you may not be smart or handsome, but you've got dreams inside of you and dreams make you special. no matter what this world tries to throw at you, they can never take those dreams away.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{what the fuck are you talking about, mom?}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{i don't know. i'm drunk. i just know that mothers are supposed to talk like that to their children when they're sad, so i tried. what do you want from me?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{nothing. that's exactly what you're supposed to do. i just blew my life. i tried to be a big shot, a hero and a stupid cop. i wanted to be recognized for being great. i should have just been happy where i was at. i didn't do my duty.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{ronnie, the other night when i soiled my pants right before i puked myself, i was thinking about how you would come home and find me and clean me up. i knew you would be there to find me and take care of me, so i was able to pass out on the floor and not worry. if there's one thing you know about, it's duty.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i do it because i love you.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{i know and i love you too, ronnie. i haven't always been easy to deal with and most people would have thrown me away a long time ago.}
<C>__{mom }
<D>__{just like your father did. but not you, ronnie. look, whiskey was always the way i dealt with being a single mother, but as i get older, i know that i can't keep doing this. i've got everything i need with you. so i want you to know that i'm ready to make a change. your life needs to get easier and you don't need to take care of old mom anymore.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{are you going to quit drinking?}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{i'm switching to beer. i can pound those all day and still keep my shit together. i'm doing it for you.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm so proud of you, mom.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{i'm proud of you. now today is a new day and we're going to get through it. now, get out there and find what the world has in store for you.}
<A>__{ronnie's mom leaves and ronnie looks at himself in the mirror. then something catches his eye. ronnie sees a newspaper laying on the ground. he picks it up and reads.}
