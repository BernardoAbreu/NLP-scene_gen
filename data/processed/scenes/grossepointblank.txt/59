<A>__{he scans the main strip. martin's p.o.v. a man walks down the street. he is felix, a bookish, forgettable man in his forties, wearing le coq sportif sweats and shoes. he looks as if he has a dark cloud over his head. martin's seen him somewhere, and doesn't like what he remembers. martin's pov tracks him. felix's p.o.v. as he walks down the street, he spots the country squire, and eyes lardner and mccullers in the front seat. martin's p.o.v. follows felix's eyes to lardner and mccullers and catches their look. their eyes lock, neither wanting to betray that they've made each other. they all do a pretty good job. his p.o.v. swings to a square jawed, hale fellow wearing dark sunglasses who is approaching directly and only a few feet away. the man is going for something in his breast pocket... reaches into his own jacket, most likely for a gun....}
