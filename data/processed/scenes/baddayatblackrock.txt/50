<L>__{interior telephone operator's office}
<A>__{a cubbyhole behind the hotel clerk's desk in the lobby. at the switchboard is pete, and above him tacked on the wall is the sign:}
<B>__{smile}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{4 2 4...?}
<P>__{(he looks up)}
<A>__{camera pulls back revealing smith standing beside him. the two men exchange a nod.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{lines 're busy.}
<P>__{(he clicks off the instrument)}
<L>__{interior doc's lab}
<A>__{macreedy slowly puts down the phone. doc sips his milk, all the while staring queasily over the glass at macreedy. he puts it down, his gaze still fixed on the stranger...}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(sing song)}
<D>__{i know don't tell me lines all busy. they'll be busy all day.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(after a beat, grimacing)}
<D>__{don't look at me like that.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{like i'm a potential customer.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{everybody is and i get 'em coming and going.}
<A>__{he goes to a topographic map hanging on the wall a large, impressive map faded, fly blown and divided into sections.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(gesturing toward it)}
<D>__{first i sell 'em a piece of land. think they farm it? nope. they dig for gold.}
<A>__{he moves to photograph beside the map on the wall a large, impressive photograph of a placer mine in operation.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{they rip off the top soil of ten winding hills. they sprint in here, fog heaved with excitement, lugging nuggets, big and bright and shiny.}
<A>__{he moves to his desk, picks up a glistening blob of stone, resting next to an assayer's scales, and examines it...}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(rhetorically)}
<D>__{is it gold?}
<A>__{he bangs the rock down next to the scales.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{it is not! do they quit? they do not!}
<A>__{he moves to a third illustration a colored reproduction, large and impressive of acres upon green acres of produce in bloom; the kind of picture southern pacific places above its calendars.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(with theatrical}
<D>__{gesture toward}
<P>__{reproduction)}
<D>__{then they decide to farm. farm! in country so dry you have to prime a man before he can spit, and before you can say "fat sam" they're stalled, stranded and starving. they get weevil brained and buttsprung...}
<A>__{he moves to the coffins piled in a corner and runs his hand down the smooth pine sides with loving tenderness.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{so i bury 'em.}
<P>__{(a beat, as he rejoins}
<D>__{macreedy in the center}
<P>__{of the room)}
<D>__{but why should i bore you with my triumphs?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{yeah. i've got a problem of my own.}
<A>__{doc nods; he points vaguely toward the street...}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(like an old testament prophet)}
<D>__{they're going to kill you with no hard feelings.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(nastily)}
<D>__{and you'll just sit on your hands and let them.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{don't get waspish with me, young feller.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i feel for you, but i'm consumed with apathy. why should i mix in?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{to save a life.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i got enough trouble saving my own.}
<P>__{(he refills his glass}
<D>__{from a milk bottle}
<P>__{on the desk)}
<D>__{i try to live right and drink my orange juice every day. but mostly i try to mind my own business. which is something i'd advise you to do.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{it's a little late for that...}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{you can still get out of town. and you'd better get out like a whisper.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{how can i?}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(taking a key ring from his pocket)}
<D>__{i got sort of a limousine at your disposal.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{where is it?}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(tossing him the key)}
<D>__{out back.}
<A>__{macreedy snares the key and walks out. doc gets up to follow him.}
