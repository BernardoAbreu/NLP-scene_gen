<L>__{exterior king swimming pool day}
<A>__{matt walks out the patio doors. seated on the steps of the shallow end, alexandra is on her cellphone.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{i gotta go. i will see you later.}
<P>__{(to matt)}
<D>__{the pool's really dirty. what day does the pool guy come?}
<A>__{matt notices all the floating leaves and insects.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{he comes... you know, i don't know what day he comes.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{awesome.}
<A>__{matt grabs a pole to skim the surface of the water.}
<C>__{alexandra }
<D>__{sid's coming over.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{who's sid?}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{a really good friend from punahou. we were in school together for years.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{oh. okay.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{he wants to be there for me with all this shit happening.}
<A>__{matt wonders his own version of "what am i, chopped liver?"}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{do i know his parents?}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{no. he might stay over too. is that cool?}
<A>__{just then, scottie runs out onto the patio dressed in a bra}
<B>__{and panties.}
<C>__{alexandra }
<D>__{what the fuck? get out of my underwear, you freak.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{ooo, la la! don't i look divine?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{scottie, get back inside and change into your swimsuit.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{now.}
<A>__{scottie flips him off and runs back inside.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{real good job you're doing.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{that's part of why i brought you here. you have to help me. i don't know what to do with her.}
<A>__{alexandra slides into the water, swims to the other side and props herself on the edge, floating her lower body. matt lowers himself into the water too.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{maybe if you spent more time with her, she wouldn't act like such a complete spaz. get her out of town go camp on kaua'i. that's what mom did with me whenever i was losing it.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{listen, alex, your mother isn't well.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{obviously.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{they just told me she isn't going to wake up. it's for sure now. the doctors are going to stop caring for her. do you understand what i'm saying? your mom wanted it this way.}
<A>__{alex remains silent.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{she has a will, see, saying we have to do it like this. we both do. that's why i got you. we're letting her go.}
<A>__{alex looks at him, takes a couple quick, loud inhalations, then slips underwater where she swims, face contorted, hoping to stay down there forever. finally she emerges above the pool and gets out, grabbing a towel, crying now.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{why'd you have to tell me in the goddamned pool?}
<A>__{matt climbs out and approaches her, arms extended.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{alex... alex...}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<A>__{matt drops his arms, crestfallen. alex scoffs, walks back into the house.}
