<L>__{exterior the alleyway late afternoon}
<A>__{as charlie and vito move down the alley, a clap of thunder unleashes a summer downpour. pedestrians run for cover.}
<B>__{thin old man}
<A>__{carrying a brown leather satchel, scurries out of the bank. he hoists the satchel over his head as protection from the rain.}
<B>__{vito heads down the sidewalk}
<A>__{toward the payroll messenger. charlie follows on the opposite sidewalk, scanning the alley for potential problems.}
<B>__{as the payroll messenger enters the alley}
<A>__{a young man pushing a rack of garments through the rain, falls in behind him.}
<B>__{vito slows as he spots a policeman on horseback}
<A>__{on seventh avenue. the cop looks up the alley, then rides on.}
<B>__{at the service entrance to seventh avenue fashions}
<A>__{a workman finishes loading a sidewalk elevator, and yells below for a co worker to bring it down.}
<B>__{as the payroll messenger}
<A>__{nears seventh avenue fashions, vito hurries to catch him.}
<B>__{across the street}
<A>__{feeling for his gun, charlie heads across the alley toward vito. a horn blares. he jumps back and a long truck rolls slowly past, cutting off his path.}
<B>__{vito tackles the payroll messenger}
<A>__{sending the satchel skidding across the wet sidewalk and down the shaft of the sidewalk elevator. the young man pushing the garment rack pulls a pistol from his coat.}
<B>__{vito scrambles to his feet}
<A>__{and races to the elevator as the cover closes. he heaves it back open. the workman stands in the receding elevator, satchel at his feet, looking up into the barrel of vito's gun. the workman squats and grabs the satchel.}
<B>__{as the truck finally passes}
<A>__{charlie spots the young man with his gun out, trying to maneuver the rack out of his path. desperate, he pushes the clothes aside, and steps halfway through the rack, gun drawn.}
<B>__{above the elevator}
<A>__{as the terrified workman tosses the satchel up. as vito grabs it, a shot knocks him to the sidewalk.}
<B>__{on the young man leaning through the rack}
<A>__{as he takes dead aim for a second shot at vito.}
<B>__{charlie garbs the rack and jerks it down into the street}
<A>__{pulling the gunman along with it. charlie races to vito and pulls him to his feet. blood seeps through a hole in his chest. charlie grabs the satchel from his arms.}
<B>__{the mounted policeman}
<A>__{appears at seventh avenue and charges up the alley on horseback, as charlie drags vito up the sidewalk. charlie pulls out his pistol and fires at the horse.}
<B>__{on the policeman}
<A>__{as he and his horse tumble to the pavement.}
<B>__{charlie pushes vito into the back seat of the car}
<A>__{tosses the satchel into the front, and climbs behind the wheel. the car spins off the wet sidewalk, crashing to the street.}
<B>__{behind the car}
<A>__{the dismounted policeman fires, shattering the rear window.}
<B>__{inside the car}
<A>__{as it slows, its path blocked by the long truck that stopped charlie as he tried to cross the street. charlie jerks the steering wheel, sending the car up onto the sidewalk and past the truck.}
<B>__{an hasidic jew carrying a package}
<A>__{backs out of a doorway into the path of the oncoming car.}
<B>__{charlie slams on the brakes}
<A>__{but the car slides on the wet pavement, slamming into the man with a sickening thud, and sending him flying over the hood, up the windshield, and across the roof of the car.}
<B>__{charlie beats on the steering wheel}
<A>__{in frustration, as the car pulls out onto eighth avenue. the rain cutting the smear of blood on the windshield. charlie looks back at vito, sprawled in the back seat, dead.}
<B>__{consumed with rage}
<A>__{charlie grabs the satchel and dumps the money out the window.}
<B>__{on the street}
<A>__{as a cloud of dollars dance on the urban canyon breeze.}
