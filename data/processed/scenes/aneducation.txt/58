<A>__{the bristol pulls up outside danny's bedford square flat.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{who wants to come up for a drink?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{jenny?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(still furious)}
<D>__{no thanks. you go. i will find my own way home.}
<A>__{jenny gets out of the car and starts up the road. david gets out and starts to chase after her.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{jenny!}
<A>__{he catches up with her in the street.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it was an old map. a speed. it was cooped up in that miserable little cottage, and she didn't even know what it was. what a waste! it shouldn't spend its life on a wall in wherever the hell we are. it should be with us. we know how to look after it properly. we liberated it.}
<A>__{jenny snorts derisively.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{liberated! that's one word for it.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(quickly and passionately)}
<D>__{oh, don't be bourgeois, jenny. you're better than that. i know you have fun with us. i can see it. you drink everything i put in front of you down in one, every last drop, and then you slam your glass down on the bar and ask for more, and it's wonderful. we're not clever like you, so we have to be clever in other ways, because if we weren't, there would be no fun. we have to be clever with maps, and..and.. you want to know what stats are? stats are old ladies who are scared of coloured people. so i move the coloureds in and the old ladies move out and i buy their flats cheap. that's what i do. so now you know.}
<A>__{jenny nods reluctantly.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{and if you don't like it, then i will understand, and you can go back to twickenham and listen to the home service and do your latin homework. but these weekends, and the restaurants and the concerts..they don't grow on trees.}
<A>__{jenny looks at him, startled. trees again?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{do you understand? of course you do. this is who we are, jenny.}
<A>__{he turns to face her and holds out his hand. on jenny: is she in or out? jenny takes his hand. david pulls her towards him, holds her around the waist and begins to dance with her. further up the pavement, helen and danny watch, laughing.}
