<L>__{interior red parlor night}
<A>__{the harp sings out, lively, expertly played by mary. theo, luke, todd and nell are impressed with her skill.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{it's an erard. late 1870s.}
<A>__{she plays, and as she does, she's aware of the room, and the house, and she sees something in a curtain or the fireplace, or a window, something at the edge of perception. she suddenly stops.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{the harp is out of tune.}
<A>__{she finds a key and begins tightening the strings as marrow bangs open the door, briefcase in one hand, cell phone in the other. he can't conceal his irritation. marrow removes folders from his briefcase, passes them around while she plays. nell again studies the cherub of death on the spine of the leather bound books.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{i will have to count david watts as a no show. so let's start. thank you, mary.}
<A>__{that was a little abrupt, she feels it. everybody finds a chair or spot on the sofa. mary remains on the stool by the harp. marrow sits in a large winged back chair.}
<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{all right? so, to answer your earlier question, todd, why are we here? what do we all need in life, what are the basics? we need food, we need water, we need sleep. sleep. all of you resist it? why? what does that mean? why do we resist sleep? my field of study is the individual's psychology of emotion and performance.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{so why did you need the addam's family mansion for a scientific test?}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{i thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and i wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily. you'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{when do we take the tests?}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{every day. basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.}
<A>__{nell and theo are looking through their folders: sheets of paper, bizarre geometric puzzles.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{also, there is no phone service to the house and no tv. i have the cell phone for emergencies. we'll begin the tests after breakfast tomorrow.}
<A>__{the others shuffle through papers, nell and todd intent on them, theo interested but not overly so, luke, bored.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{dr. marrow, what is this house?}
<A>__{when she says this, we should be seeing her from an odd perspective, the house's pov.}
<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{there was once a king who built a palace. the king's name was hugh crain. a hundred and thirty years ago, when the merrimack valley was the center of american industry, hugh crain made two hundred million dollars. that's forty three billion dollars in today's money. he could have anything he wanted. and what he wanted, was rene, his banker's beautiful daughter. rene, and a house filled with children.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{all the carvings.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{but there's a sad catch to the story.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{there were no children. rene died, and}
<A>__{then hugh crain built}
<D>__{all of this, and then he died. his heart was broken.}
<A>__{nell shifts, looks at the house with a strange feeling.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{that's so sad.}
<A>__{this has been tense between them, a gunfight. pop! a log in the fireplace makes everyone jump. theo relishes it, but nell shudders.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i think there's more to the story. this house has its own music, doctor marrow, i can play it for you, i can hear it.}
<A>__{mary plays, channeling unholy music from the house, from the walls, from the curtain, from the air. her fingers fly down the harp to the thickest wire and tang! like a steel whip the wire snaps. mary screams in pain.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{my eye... oh... my eye... my eye... oh... no...}
<A>__{the others leap up in shock. blood lines the wall behind her. she clutches at her eye, more blood spilling out from between her fingers.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{oh jesus.}
<A>__{marrow and theo rush over to her as she shrieks in pain. todd is frozen, pale, like he's about to be sick. nell turns the other way, but not because she's scared she's searching for a shot glass on a side table. marrow wraps mary in his arms. her shrieking becomes a terrified but quieter wail.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{mary, let me see your eye.}
<A>__{nell appears by his side with the glass. marrow pries mary's hand from her face. blood flows freely from the eyelid, but her eye is intact.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{here, cover it. don't let her touch it.}
