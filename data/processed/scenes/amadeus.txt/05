<L>__{interior old salieri's salon night}
<A>__{old salieri lies on the floor in a pool of blood, an open razor in his hand. he has cut his throat but is still alive. he gestures at them. they run to him. barely, we glimpse the room an old chair, old tables piled with books, a forte piano, a chamber pot on the floor as the valet and the cook struggle to lift their old master, and bind his bleeding throat with a napkin.}
