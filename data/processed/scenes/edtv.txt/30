<C>__{ed}
<D>__{no. the bathroom is off limits and when i go to sleep they go to other programming. unless i get up. then they go back on the air. unless i get up to go to the bathroom, i guess, then }
<C>__{al}
<D>__{what if you're vomiting?}
<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(amazed by the question)}
<D>__{what if i'm vomiting?}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{do they show it?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i guess i don't it's all in the contract. there's this million page contract }
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?}
<C>__{marcia}
<P>__{(accusing, to ed)}
<D>__{what happened? you described this "crazy kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on tv?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{no! i barely even mentioned it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever i'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.}
<C>__{marcia}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{they're gonna mock our foibles.}

<C>__{marcia}
<D>__{our foibles, our foibles!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{we don't have foibles.}
<C>__{marcia}
<D>__{everyone has foibles. then the whole country sees them on tv and mocks them. then we have... mocked foibles.}
<C>__{jeantte}
<D>__{eddie, please don't let them mock our foibles.}
<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(losing it)}
<D>__{stop saying foibles!}
<C>__{marcia}
<D>__{look, my life is not so great, that i want it shown on television. and neither is yours.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{that's the point this could change things.}
<C>__{marcia}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{for instance... me and my friend bucky are buying out my boss. his equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.}
<C>__{marcia}
<P>__{(points to ed)}
<D>__{what does that have to do with... ?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{if they keep ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.}
<A>__{ed nods. pause.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{i borrow against that now, at the bank. buy the business. and ed becomes a silent partner. now here's the beauty part. while we're on tv i plug the shit out of the business. free advertising.}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{how about sex?}
<A>__{a stunned pause. they all look at al.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i'11 have to pass, al. and it's not an age thing }
<C>__{al}
<D>__{no! do they show you having sex?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{no. kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{at what point?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{at the point i don't look you'd be on tv maybe one or two times each. i'11 try to avoid i'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. believe me.}
<A>__{we hear: a loud drilling sound.}
