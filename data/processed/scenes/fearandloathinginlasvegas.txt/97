<L>__{interior flamingo hotel suite night}
<A>__{darkness. insanely, somewhere nilsson plays "put the lime in the coconut and mix em all up..."}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{what kind of rat bastard psychotic would play that song right now, at this moment?}
<A>__{duke opens his eyes and the hotel suite rushes in. he lies, awkwardly twisted unable to move. he could have been there days months.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{when i came to the general back alley ambiance of the suite was so rotten, so incredibly foul. how long had i been lying there? hours? days? months? all these signs of violence. what had happened?}
<A>__{duke moves his eyes taking in his surroundings: like the sight of some disastrous zoological experiment involving whisky and gorillas. blue and red christmas tree lights replace lightbulbs, used towels hanging everywhere, pornographic pictures ripped out of a magazine are plastered on a shattered mirror.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{there was evidence in this room of excessive consumption of almost every type of drug known to civilized man since 1544 ad.}
<A>__{duke manages to move stiffly gets to his bare feet hobbles round the trashed room like a newly risen ape.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{but what kind of addict would need all these coconut husks and crushed honeydew rinds? would the presence of junkies account for all these uneaten french fries? these puddles of glazed ketchup on the bureau? maybe so, but then why all this booze? and these crude pornographic photos smeared with mustard that had dried to a hard yellow crust...}
<A>__{duke peers into gonzo's room his bed like a burned out rat's nest blackened springs and wires.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{these were not the hoof prints of your normal god fearing junkie. it was too savage, too aggressive.}
