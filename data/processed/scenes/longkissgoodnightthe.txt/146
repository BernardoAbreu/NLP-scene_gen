<L>__{interior perkins' limousine same time}
<A>__{perkins hears a garbled, pained voice over his headset:}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{point team leader, reporting... she's... incapacitated the truck... i'm damaged, sir, i believe i'm dying... instructions...?}
<C>__{perkins}
<D>__{continue dying. out.}
<A>__{he leans back. stares sightlessly. loosens his tie, hits the intercom and says:}
<C>__{perkins}
<D>__{anthony, get me the president...}
<A>__{he takes out a bottle of scotch. cut to:}
<L>__{interior chapel same time}
<A>__{charly and timothy. they circle, two pros.}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{you've lost a step, chuck. muscles never recovered from c section, i will bet. am i right?}
<A>__{never watching the eyes, the eyes are liars, they watch the hands... the gathered saints look on, neutral.}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{please, man... she's only... eight... she's a beautiful little girl...}
<A>__{his concentration never falters as he says:}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{she's a worthless bitch. i know it 'cause she came out of me.}
<A>__{he lunges with the knife, she spins away he gets hold of one arm and flings her, up and over...! she sails through space. twists in mid air. lands like a cat. almost. staggers forward. they circle...}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{it's called shock, charly... your body wants to go into shock...}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{fuck you, your breathing's lousy...}
<A>__{charly launches herself. avoids a stab at her throat, eats that for breakfast, spins, slams the knuckles of her right hand into timothy's ribs. busts one. he snarls, traps her wrist: crack! wrist, broken. she hisses in pain, falls back}
<B>__{gasping.}
<A>__{circling again. charly cannot walk a straight line.}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{look at you. you're out of your motherfucking league, dearie.}
<B>__{close on charly}
<A>__{she looks up at him from sunken eyes shot through with red, and in those eyes we glimpse it; the demon, laughing... as charly whispers:}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{...you want a piece...? take my shoulder.}
<A>__{he lunges with the knife...! she ducks, trips on purpose and hands him her shoulder, all that's missing is the plate and wham. in goes the knife, cuts deep and charly looks him in the eye and grins because sure enough, there's the bastard's knee, wide open... boot strikes, bam ! shears the knee, and timothy howls in agony. stumbles backward into the bannister grabs his coat. brings out the gun, it goes off ! charly dives for cover. rips the knife from her own shoulder and flings it. takes him in the shoulder. topples him back. bannister. up and over, flailing...! drops from sight. charly falls back. pause. sucking air. sits down hard. legs splayed. looks down at herself, oh, god... there's a hole in her chest.}
