<A>__{a spotlight slicing across a crowded smoke choked club to a small stage where a cabaret performer sings. its september, 1939. general sigmund list's armored divisions, driving north from the sudetenland, have taken cracow, and now, in this club, drinking, socializing, conducting business, is a strange clientele: ss officers and polish cops, gangsters and girls and entrepreneurs, thrown together by the circumstance of war. oskar schindler, drinking alone, slowly scans the room, the faces, stripping away all thats unimportant to him, settling only on details that are: the rank of this man, the higher rank of that one, money being slipped into a hand.}
<B>__{waiter sets down drinks}
<A>__{in front of the ss officer who took the money. a lieutenant, hes at a table with his girlfriend and a lower ranking officer.}

<A>__{his sergeant doesnt. his girlfriend doesn't.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{find out who he is.}
<A>__{the sergeant makes his way over to schindler's table. there's a handshake and introductions before and the lieutenant, watching, can't believe it his guy accepts the chair schindler's dragging over. the lieutenant waits, but his man doesn't come back; he's forgotten already he went there for a reason. finally, and it irritates the ss man, he has to get up and go over there.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{stay here.}
<A>__{his girlfriend watches him cross toward schindler's table. before he even arrives, schindler is up and berating him for leaving his date way over there across the room, waving at the girl to come join them, motioning to waiter to slide some tables together.}
<B>__{waiters arrive with plates of caviar}
<A>__{and another round of drinks. the lieutenant makes a halfhearted move for his wallet.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{let me get this one.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{no, put it away, put it away.}
<A>__{schindler's already got his money out. even as he's paying, his eyes are working the room, settling on a table where a girl is declining the advances of two more high ranking ss men.}

<B>__{roar of laughter}
<A>__{erupts from schindler's party in the corner. nobody's having a better time than those people over there. his guests have swelled to ten or twelve ss men, polish cops, girls and he moves among them like the great entertainer he is, making sure everybody's got enough to eat and drink. here, closer, at this table across the room, an ss officer gestures to one of the ss men who an hour ago couldn't get the girl to sit at his table. the guy comes over.}

<B>__{girl with a big camera}
<A>__{screws in a flashbulb. she lifts the unwieldy thing to her face and focuses. as the bulb flashes, the noise of the club suddenly drops out, and the moment is caught in black and white: oskar schindler, surrounded by his many new friends, smiling urbanely.}
