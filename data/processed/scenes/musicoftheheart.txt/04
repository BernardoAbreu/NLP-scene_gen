<D>__{i'm sorry, m'am. we have orders to deliver these.}
<A>__{assunta looks beyond the man, dismayed.}
<B>__{her pov}
<A>__{large wooden crates cover her front lawn, and two movers plant down another. they hurry back to the truck, grabbing the next crate too quickly this time. it slips from their hands, crashes to the ground and splinters open. several violin cases spill out. the crate looks like it holds a whole lot more.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{instantly a second story window is flung open, and roberta sticks her head out, a hundred times more energized than we've seen her so far.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{watch it, you idiots! be careful with those!}
<A>__{the men scramble to pick them up. assunta looks at all the violins, then up at roberta.}
