<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior apartment building day}
<A>__{an old fifties two level, polynesian lamps and glitter stucco, now faded and browinish with water stains. gabriel, the young man with the sunglasses and leather jacket we last saw kicking down the door at the flophouse, walks up the apartment's stairs to the second level, knocks once, and opens the door.}
<B>__{the apartment inside}
<A>__{hasn't been very well looked after lately. either has the occupant. sitting slumped in a kitchen chair, staring at the floor, he peers through dully yellow eyes that barely seem to register his visitor.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{gee jerry, you look like shit.}
<A>__{the eyes lift to gabriel, revealing a pale, bloodless face eaten with dried sores.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{leave me alone, gabriel.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{soon, pal. soon.}
<A>__{gabriel drops into the chair across from jerry and pushes aside with distaste the maggot ridden plates of food piled on the table. he reaches his hand out to jerry.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{come here.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{go away.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<P>__{(sing song, like to a baby)}
<D>__{come here...}
<A>__{gabriel puts his hand under jerry's chin and turns the face side to side, examining the cracked, decaying skin and filmy eyes.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{hmmm. still a little life left in you. barely.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<A>__{gabriel releases jerry's chin and slouches down in the chair.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{there's something i want you to do for me.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{what a surprise.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{don't be that way.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i just want to... why won't you let me...}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i will, i will. promise.}
<A>__{a dark, intestinal looking amber fluid begins to pool out of jerry's pant leg.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you need some new clothes, son.}
<A>__{a tear wells in jerry's decomposing face.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{aw come on, don't start. you know how i hate that...}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i'm so tired. i'm so goddamn tired.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{watch the profanity. just one more favor. honest.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(deep sigh)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i want you to get something for me. a few personal effects the cops ripped off from the lovely allenwood arms on seventh street. it'll be sitting in their property room down on san julian.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i'm supposed to just go in there? like this?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{give you a bath, put on some decent clothes,}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{maybe a very large brim hat, you'll be fine. just go in between five and five ten, it's a shift change and nobody'll notice you.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<P>__{(cocks an eye)}
<D>__{c'mon.}
<P>__{(tosses yellow id card onto table)}
<D>__{this should be more or less up to date.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{got a name this stuff is under?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{john doe.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{why doesn't that surprise me.}
<A>__{gabriel gets up, pats jerry on the head, and walks to the door.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i will see you tonight.}
<P>__{(flips him silver dollar)}
<D>__{here's some bus fare.}
