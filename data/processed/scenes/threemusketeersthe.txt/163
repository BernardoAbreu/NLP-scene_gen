<A>__{pandemonium, inside and outside the palace. athos, porthos, and aramis emerge from the crowd at the entrance, draw their swords, and prepare to rush the long line of guards protecting the doors. the guards cannot believe what they are seeing. three men against a hundred. it's ridiculous. but then... the looks on guards' faces begin to change, subtly at first, from amusement to horror.}

<A>__{behind athos, porthos, and aramis, something incredible happens. musketeers appear from every direction. some from the surrounding crowd. some from buildings, rooftops. others appear on horseback, a few disguised as monks. and all defiantly wearing their blue and gold tunics. the murmur of the crowd becomes an excited roar. the corps of musketeers line up behind athos, porthos, and aramis. porthos and aramis exchange a smile. athos keeps his usually dour expression. but his eyes are charged with excitement. they raise their arms, and face the long line of guards. a hundred sabers flash in the sunlight.}
