<L>__{int: bake my day continuous}
<A>__{gru unlocks the door and enters. jingle! bells on the door ring. the inside is sugary and clean and quainterior gru takes it all in. then turns to the minions.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{alright, here is the cupcake recipe i got off the internet.}
<A>__{the minions excitedly grab the recipe and head for the kitchen. gru kicks stuart, who is still staggering around in the potted plant.}
<C>__{gru }
<D>__{and don't go nuts with the sprinkles!}
<A>__{gru is left alone. he looks around. sees a bunny cupcake in a glass cake dish. then a shark cupcake in the next cake dish. and in the next dish he sees lucy's head. she makes a funny face. gru screams, which causes lucy to scream and jump up, hitting her head on one of the shelves, sending all of the cupcakes flying. lucy immediately goes into action, using incredible and frankly weird looking martial arts moves to dispatch the cupcakes as they fly toward her.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{ha! yaa! ho! ooof! zaaa! ay ay ay ay ay!}
<A>__{she successfully eliminates all of the cupcakes, then turns to gru, out of breath.}
<C>__{lucy }
<D>__{whoo. wasn't expecting that.}
<P>__{(strikes a martial arts pose)}
<D>__{or was i?}
<A>__{gru has a cupcake stuck to the top of his head, frosting side down. lucy gestures as if he's got a little food on his face.}
<C>__{lucy }
<D>__{ooh... you got... you got... a little...}
<A>__{the cupcake slowly slides down, then falls to the floor. it leaves a long smear on gru's face.}
<C>__{lucy }
<D>__{here, i will i will get it.}
<A>__{gru stands frozen as she tries to clean him up.}
<C>__{lucy }
<D>__{oh, that's just spreading...um...}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{alright, alright. i got it. i got it!... stop it!}
<A>__{lucy backs off.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{oh! i will let you get it.}
<A>__{gru sighs and wipes the frosting off his face.}
<C>__{lucy }
<D>__{yeah, what you just saw there was a little something new i've been working on. it's a combination of jujitsu, krav maga, aztec warfare, and krumping.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{okay, that's weird why are you here?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{on assignment from silas. i'm your new partner. yay!}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{what?! no, no "yay." ramsbottom didn't say anything about a partner.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{well, seems that because of your checkered past, everyone else refused to work with you. but not me. i stepped up. and i'm new, so i kind of have to do what they tell me anyway.}
<A>__{gru is about to respond when dave the minion comes out the kitchen door. he carries a cupcake in the shape of a minion.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{walla!}
<A>__{immediately lucy moves with lightning quick reflexes. she smashes his cupcake, flips him into the air, and pins him to the counter. dave screams.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{you know this guy?}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{yes, he's one of my minions.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry. i should have known.}
<A>__{she releases him.}
<C>__{lucy }
<D>__{you're free to go.}
<A>__{dave stares at lucy. immediately smitten. a magical glow appears around her as romantic music plays. we go into dave's fantasy.}
