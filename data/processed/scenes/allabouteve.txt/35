<L>__{interior richards' studio apartment day}
<A>__{one large room, a small foyer with a door to the corridor. a stair up one wall to a narrow balcony from which a couple of bedroom open. karen is painting. earnestly but badly. a still life of an orange, an avocado, an eggplant and three bananas.}
<C>__{karen's voice}
<D>__{on the day of the audition, my biggest worry was to keep a banana looking part of an eggplant... then lloyd came home.}
<P>__{(in the b.g., lloyd lets himself in)}
<D>__{it was right after his brawl with margo...}
<A>__{lloyd slams the door, flings his hat away, strides in, peeling off muffler and overcoat.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{lloyd, what happened...?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{up to here! that's where i've got it up to here! of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{margo, again...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{and again and again! two hours late for the audition, to begin with }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{that's on time for margo.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{then a childish, heavy handed routine about not knowing eve was her understudy }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{it's just possible she didn't...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{of course she knew! for one thing, addison told her how superbly eve had read the part !}
<P>__{(suddenly softening)}
<D>__{karen, let me tell you about eve. she's got everything a born actress. sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{ don't run out of adjectives, dear.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{ everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for miss channing...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{margo hasn't done badly by it.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{margo. margo's great. she knows it. that's the trouble. she can play peck's bad boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?}
<A>__{he starts up the stairs to the bedroom.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(murmurs)}
<D>__{it's going to be a cozy weekend.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(pauses)}
<D>__{what is?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{we're driving out to the country tomorrow night. just the four of us. bill, margo, you and i...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{well. we've spent weekends before with nobody talking...}
<P>__{(continues up stairs)}
<D>__{... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects...}
<A>__{as he goes into one of the bedrooms, karen sits thoughtfully on a couch. she muses...}
<C>__{karen's voice}
<D>__{newton they say, thought of gravity by getting hit on the head by an apple. and the man who invented the steam engine, he was watching a tea kettle... but not me. my big idea came to me just sitting on a couch...}
<A>__{she lies down, folds her hands behind her head.}
<C>__{karen's voice}
<D>__{that boot in the rear to margo. heaven knows she had one coming. from me, from lloyd, from eve, bill, max, and so on we'd all felt those size fives of hers often enough... but how? the answer was buzzing around me like a fly...}
<A>__{she sits up. she smiles. the smile fades...}
<C>__{karen's voice}
<D>__{i had it. but i let it go. screaming and calling names is one thing but this could mean...}
<A>__{she shakes her head, crosses to her easel, resumes work on the bananas. she slows down, then stops.}
<C>__{karen's voice}
<D>__{why not? why, i said to myself, not? it would all seem perfectly legitimate. and there were only two people in the world who would know. also, the boot would land where it would do the most good for all concerned }
<A>__{she puts the brush away and crosses to the phone which is by lloyd's work chair. as she crosses:}
<C>__{karen's voice}
<D>__{and after all, it was not more than a perfectly harmless joke which margo, herself, would be the first to enjoy...}
<A>__{she looks in a leather phone book, pick up the phone and dials.}
<C>__{karen's voice}
<D>__{... and no reason why she shouldn't be told about it in time.}
<A>__{there's an answer at the other end.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{hello... will you call miss eve harrington to the phone, please? not at all... thank you.}
<A>__{and as she waits we...}
