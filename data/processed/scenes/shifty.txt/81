<A>__{chris looks about at the bits and bobs that litter her front room. sleeping felines. chintzy ornaments of cats. he picks up a framed photo of her daughter, loretta, in better days, fresh faced, before the scars, ready to take on the world. he looks slightly shocked to see this.}

<A>__{chris sits in a sunken armchair, and looks around the room. he looks closely at a sleeping cat near his chair. he moves his foot and touches it but it slides along the floor, not moving just solid, as if frozen. it dawns on chris that all the cats in the room are stuffed. chris sits back in the chair, suddenly from next door, the deep hum of a drum and bass track starts thumping through the wall. it's so heavy it makes the shelves of chintzy cat ornaments rattle.}
