<L>__{interior oahu bar day}
<A>__{danny and the pilots are in hawaiian shirts, their party in full swing. a bucket sized hollowed out volcano sits in the middle of the table, with twelve straws emerging from the crater. it's full of booze or was; danny and the other guys are pulling heartily at the straws, and they gurgle as the last liquid is sucked dry.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{more m mai tai's!}
<A>__{coma is sitting there with them, beside red.}
<C>__{coma}
<D>__{absolutely right.}
<A>__{everybody's having a ball, the new arrivals fitting right in with the others. danny's a bit off to himself, lost in his own thoughts. billy and anthony are doing the hula to the hawaiian music playing.}
<C>__{coma}
<D>__{no, you guys aren't doing it right. it's in the hands. they talk story.}
<A>__{coma stands and starts demonstrating, explaining the gestures of his hula.}
<C>__{coma}
<D>__{fish swim in ocean... happy in the mother sea... girl, beautiful girl, with big jugs, walks into water...waves lapping at her thighs...}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{i never knew those dances were so sophisticated.}
<C>__{coma}
<D>__{...fish nibble at her breasts...}
<A>__{coma's really into his dance, his hands over enormous imaginary breasts; but as he turns toward the windows }
<C>__{coma}
<D>__{a more beautiful girl walks by...}
<A>__{the guys see evelyn passing on the other side of the street, gorgeous in the sunshine. coma's hands start squeezing the imaginary breasts of his hula.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{hey, isn't that evelyn?}
<A>__{danny moves up to look.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{rafe's girl, evelyn?}
<C>__{coma}
<D>__{you guys know her?! i gotta have an intro! man, i'd like to }
<A>__{danny's hand is suddenly around coma's larynx.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{a friend of mine's in love with her. so you don't even look not ever.}
<A>__{danny releases him and coma staggers back to the table to nuzzle up to one of the straws of the mai tai volcano. danny looks out the window again and sees evelyn's beautiful form disappear around the corner, on her way back to the base hospital. danny moves back to the table, and as two burly hawaiian waiters set another full loaded mai tai volcano onto the center of the table, he picks up a glass and dips it full of the potent liquid. he shouts to the whole room }
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i'm a better pilot than any son of a bitch on this island! so i'm the one to say this! here's to rafe mccawley! a better pilot...and a better man...than me.}
<A>__{the other pilots drink up from glasses or from straws.}
<C>__{other pilots}
<D>__{to rafe.}
<A>__{danny drains the whole glass at one chug, and slams it down onto the table. then he blinks, puts a hand on his stomach, and frowns. coma recognizes the look.}
<C>__{coma}
<D>__{uh oh. volcanic eruption!}
<A>__{danny bends at the waist; his head obscured by the table.}
<C>__{coma}
<D>__{shit, he's puking on my feet!}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{well, you p puked on his feet.}
<C>__{coma}
<D>__{yeah, but he was wearing shoes!}
