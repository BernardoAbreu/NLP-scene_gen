<A>__{as they scan the desert, the people are feeling like they may get out of this after all. earl calls back to the people in the semi trailer.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{any sign of'em?}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{maybe they just gave up, you know.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{yeah, the bulldozer's too much for them, man.}
<A>__{as they top a gentle rise, burt excitedly points ahead.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{there we go, solid rock!}
<A>__{everyone cheers. but then heather points up ahead to one side.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{p.o.v. the group dust cloud day perhaps two hundred yards from them, a huge cloud of dust wells up from behind big boulders.}

<A>__{everyone stares uneasily at the billowing cloud.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{is it them?}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{what else could it be?}
<C>__{mindy}
<D>__{what're they doing?}

<C>__{earl}
<D>__{no. we go straight.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{damn it. what the hell are they doing? they're up to something.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{i don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.}
