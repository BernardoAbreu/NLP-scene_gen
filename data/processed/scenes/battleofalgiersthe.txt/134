<A>__{night. at number three rue des abderames, on the first floor balcony, the stove fires are glowing. the women are cooking outside on their stoves built from tin containers. they are cooking in front of the doors of their homes. the doorways are lit up. ali passes along the balcony, passes by mahmoud and his wife who are speaking in whispers by themselves and leaning on the railing. it is a warm and starry night. mahmoud says some more words to his wife, still speaking in whispers, tenderly. then he follows ali who has stopped in front of the door.}
