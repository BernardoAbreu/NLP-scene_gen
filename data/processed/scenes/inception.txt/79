<L>__{interior great hall, ecole d'architecture morning}
<A>__{cobb, carrying a shopping bag, looks into a lecture hall: no students, just a rumpled professor hunched over paperwork.}
<L>__{interior lecture hall continuous}
<C>__{cobb }
<D>__{you never did like your office.}
<A>__{professor miles looks up, squinting. recognizes cobb.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{no space to think in that broom cupboard.}
<A>__{cobb steps down past the empty wooden rows.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{is it safe for you to be here?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{extradition between france and the u.s. is a bureaucratic nightmare.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i think they'd find a way to make it work in your case.}
<A>__{cobb hand miles the shopping bag.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{can you take these back for the kids?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{it'll take more than the occasional stuffed animal to convince those children they still have a father.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{i know. i thought you could talk to marie about bringing them on vacation. somewhere i could meet }
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{why would she listen to me?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you were married for twenty years.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{she blames me as much as you.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{doesn't she understand that my kids need me?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{yes, she does. we all do. go back and face the music, dom. explain what mal did.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{be realistic, stephen. they'd never understand they'd lock me up and throwaway the key. or worse.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you think what you're doing now is helping your case?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{lawyers don't pay for themselves. this is what i have. this is what you taught me.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i never taught you to be a thief.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{no, you taught me to navigate other people's minds. but after what happened with mal there weren't a whole lot of legitimate ways for me to use that skill.}
<A>__{miles looks at cobb.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{why did you come here, dom?}
<A>__{cobb shifts slightly.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{i found a way home. a job. for powerful people. if i pull it off, i can get back to my family. but i need help.}
<A>__{miles realizes something.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{my god. you're here to corrupt one of my brightest and best.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{if you have someone good enough, you have to let them decide for themselves. you know what i'm offering }
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{money?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{no, not just money: the chance to build cathedrals, entire cities things that have never existed, things that couldn't exist in the real world...}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{everybody dreams, cobb. architects are supposed to make those dreams real.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{that's not what you used to say. you told me that in the real world i'd be building attic conversions and gas stations. you said that if i mastered the dream share i'd have a whole new way of creating and showing people my creations. you told me it would free me.}
<A>__{miles looks at cobb, sad.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{and i'm sorry. i was wrong.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{no, you weren't. your vision was a vision of pure creativity. it's where we took it that was wrong.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{and now you want me to let someone else follow you into fantasy.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{they won't actually come on the job, they'll just design the levels and teach them to the dreamers.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{design them yourself.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{mal won't let me.}
<A>__{miles looks at cobb. appalled.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{come back to reality, dom. please.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you want to know what's real, stephen? your grandchildren waiting for their dad to come back.}
<C>__{cobb }
<D>__{this job this last job is how i get there.}
<A>__{miles looks down, fiddles with his papers.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{i wouldn't be standing here if there were any other way. i can get home. but i need an architect who's as good as i was.}
<A>__{miles looks cobb in the eye. decides.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i've got someone better.}
