<L>__{int prison cell night (1966)}
<A>__{red is sleeping. he wakes with a start.}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{but there are times i curse him for the dreams he left behind...}
<A>__{he senses a presence, looks over his shoulder. there's a rita hayworth poster on his wall. he gets out of bed. rita just keeps smiling, inscrutable. as red watches, a brilliant round glow builds behind the poster, shining from the tunnel. the poster rips free, charred to ash in the blink of an eye as a shaft of holy white light stabs into the cell. sunlight. red staggers back against the glare. a whirlwind kicks up, whipping everything into the air. the hole in the wall is like a giant vacuum cleaner papers, book, toiletries, bedding if it ain't nailed down, it gets sucked down the hole toward the light. red fights it, but the suction drags him closer and closer... red's pov ...and camera rockets into the hole, getting sucked down an endless tunnel at impossible speed, the roar of air mixing with his drawn out scream, closer and closer to the light... ...and erupting out the other side into total silence and a beautiful white beach. the pacific ocean before us. enormous. mind blowing. beautiful beyond description. all we hear now are the gentle sound of waves.}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{...dreams where i am lost in a warm place with no memory.}
<A>__{a lone figure stands at water's edge. camera keeps moving, coming up behind him and tracking around to reveal red.}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{an ocean so big it strikes me dumb. waves so quiet they strike me deaf. sunshine so bright it strikes me blind. it is a place that is blue beyond reason. bluer than can possibly exist. bluer than my mind can possibly grasp.}
<B>__{aerial shot}
<A>__{nothing for a million miles but beach, sky, and water. red is a tiny speck at water's edge. just another grain of sand.}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{i am terrified. there is no way home.}
