<L>__{interior pyramid sarcophagus chamber}
<A>__{sebastian and max are standing over the sarcophagus staring at the futuristic guns. they're a little freaked.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{any idea what those are?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{nope. you?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{good thing we brought in the experts.}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(turning to him)}
<D>__{hey. we just found the equivalent of a dvd player in moses' living room. why don't you give us a second to figure it out.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{well to me, it looks like sophisticated weaponry.}
<A>__{lex looks to weyland for a smile but instead sees that weyland is having a hard time breathing. weyland pulls out his hand held portable oxygen bottle and takes a shot into his lungs.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{is he okay?}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{it's just asthma. he's fine.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{let me see if i can get a base reading off the metal.}
<A>__{miller steps up and starts a basic spectral analysis of the metal, careful not to disturb the guns. his hand held computer starts processing the information.}
<C>__{miller }
<D>__{there are two chemicals here. tilanium and cadmium 240.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{never heard of them.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{they're found in meteorites.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{meteorites?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{whatever these are, they weren't made here.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{when you say here, you mean...?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{earth.}
<A>__{verheiden looks concerned. in fact everyone does except lex. her eyes are focused on the person she is worried about most weyland. she speaks quietly to him.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{how you doing?}
<A>__{weyland nods but he's not doing well and he can't hide it.}
<C>__{lex }
<P>__{(to the group)}
<D>__{we've been out long enough for today. we're going to set up base camp tonight at the whaling station and we'll get back at it first thing tomorrow morning.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you can go back to base camp ms. woods. we're going to stay here.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{you wanted to leave without proper prep and we did. you wanted to be the first here, we are. you've claimed the find. it's yours. now we move as a team and we're done for today.}
<A>__{everyone looks at weyland to over rule her.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{you heard her.}
<A>__{the team starts out.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{what should we do about the guns, mr. weyland?}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{take them. we can run further tests on the surface.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{no...don't touch them!}
<A>__{too late. connors reaches into the sarcophagus and grabs the first two guns. max reaches in and grabs the final gun but when the weight of max's gun is removed from its place inside the chamber, a hidden trigger underneath it is activated with a deafening: click! the click echoes around the chamber. everyone shares concerned looks. for a moment nothing, then it happens. the walls of the chamber begin to move. sealing up the old entrances, and revealing brand new passageways into and out of the chamber.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{watch out! the doors! look out!}
<A>__{we move past lex, sebastian, miller, max, and connors. weyland is standing before what used to be a solid wall only now it is open to a long dark corridor.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{sebastian. that happens in all pyramids, right?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{a large block of stone quickly starts to slide down and seals the entrance before anyone can get out.}
