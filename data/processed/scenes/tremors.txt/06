<L>__{exterior jeep trail day}
<A>__{val guides the truck down a tortuous, rocky, almost impas sable trail. it takes full concentration as he fights the steering wheel, shifts, rides the brake and leans out trying to pick a decent route. earl braces his feet on the dash and munches breakfast, a raw hot dog right out of the package.}

<A>__{earl pulls a box of hershey bars from under the seat. there's only one bar left. he sets the box down between them. val glances at it and raises his fist: the challenge. one, two, three. val mimes "paper;" earl mimes "rock." earl loses. val takes the bar.}
