<L>__{exterior laforche home day}
<A>__{curtis shoulders his way out the front screen door. keys in his mouth and sack lunch in his hand, he makes his way down the porch steps and onto the front walk. he pops open the chain link gate and heads for the pick up parked on the street. clear blue sky overhead.}
<L>__{exterior soybean field day}
<A>__{small soybean plants slouch in the noonday sun. a slight breeze picks up, jostling the leaves, but the sound is drowned out by a loud, mechanical rumbling. a spiral drill churns up dark soil as it digs deeper into the ground. curtis, wearing work goggles, grabs hold of the drill's cabling system and yanks down.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{yeah, let's keep going with that bit! it'll go another 10 feet!}
<A>__{he yells to dewart(36), a big guy sitting at the controls of a diesel powered well drilling rig. the truck has a long rusted bed with metal scaffolding raised high on its back.}
<C>__{dewart}
<D>__{we won't get the gravel pack down today!}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{why not?!}
<C>__{dewart}
<D>__{those clouds! we're gonna have to call it!}
<A>__{curtis looks back to a potential storm. gray clouds forming across the horizon.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{happy hour starts at five dewart!}
<C>__{dewart}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{not if it's rainin'...ready?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{oh, yeah.}
