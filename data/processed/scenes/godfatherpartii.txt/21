<L>__{exterior lake tahoe estate day}
<A>__{the lawns of this great estate on the shore of lake tahoe are covered with guests of a wonderful party to honor the first holy communion of anthony corleone, the son of mr. and mrs. michael corleone. a full dance orchestra plays music of the times on a pavilion bandstand built especially for the occasion. speedboats roar through the water, pulling youthful waterskiers; and the pool and private harbor are filled with laughing, swimming guests. it is fall of 1958.}
