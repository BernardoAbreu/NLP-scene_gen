<A>__{mika parks her car around the corner from the apartment building, gets out and starts down the street when she sees the apartment building and the one next door are dark. candles and flashlights are visible in some of the apartment windows, a scattering of neighbors congregating outside. mika approaches a neighbor.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{hey....}
<C>__{neighbor}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{neighbor}
<D>__{power's out. us, the building behind us, that one across the street. seems like every few months, boom, the lights out. i call, i complain, they listen...nothing gets done. so i sit out here, at least it's cool.}
<A>__{mika looks up at the building, scared but not ready to believe that ninjas are responsible for everything. she pulls a tiny led flashlight out of her bag and starts into the building.}
<C>__{neighbor }
<D>__{watch your step.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{you're not the first person to give me that advice today....}
<A>__{and she continues into }
