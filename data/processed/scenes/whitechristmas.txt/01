<C>__{bob}
<D>__{thanks, fellows. i guess by now you know the old man's being replaced by a new commanding general fresh out of the pentagon... this divisions's been awfully lucky so far, but tonight they're running a special on st. christophers at the px... the old man's heading back to the rear he's never moved in that direction in his life. all i can say is, we owe so much to general waverly and the way }
<C>__{waverly's voice}
<P>__{(a bellow)}
<D>__{attention!}
<A>__{automatically, bob stiffens. phil does the same. audience full shot every man is at attention and every head has turned to where general waverly has taken up a position near the front of the platform.}
<C>__{general waverly}
<D>__{captain wallace, button your shirt. you're out of uniform!}
<P>__{(bob, grinning, hastily buttons his shirt)}
<D>__{this division is now under the command of general harold g. carlton, and i don't want anyone to forget it not that he'll let you. he's tough just what this sloppy outfit needs. you'll be standing inspection night and day you may even learn how to march. and if you don't give him everything you got, i may come back and fight for the enemy. merry christmas!}
<A>__{the boys respond with "merry christmas".}

<C>__{bob}
<D>__{perhaps i can help you out, sir.}
<A>__{he turns to the musicians, gives the downbeat. they play the old man, which is sung by the entire outfit. the general stands at attention through the first chorus, visibly moved. during the second chorus he starts up the aisle, revealing for the first time that his left leg is bandaged to the knee. the adjutant puts out his arm to help. waverly refuses. toward the finish of the song, he turns, faces the men and salutes them. the men return the salute. (this is not a military mistake, the general salutes the enlisted men as a deliberate gesture.) there is a red cross ambulance standing by.}
