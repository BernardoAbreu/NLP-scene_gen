<A>__{we find nick, a lonely, solitary figure bobbing in and out of the lights and shadows. the sound of wind whips through his helmet; cold air stings his cheeks... the tail lights of nick's bike disappear into the night.}

<A>__{civil service heaven. nick hits the cut switch and glides past the manicured lawns and well kept houses of this development. a basketball net in every driveway, a buick or chrysler in every garage. one house sticks out. the lawn is brown, paint is peeling off the garage door and newspapers are scattered on the driveway. nick glides once around the cul de sac looking at the house. his house. it's as inviting as an open grave. he shoots away.}
