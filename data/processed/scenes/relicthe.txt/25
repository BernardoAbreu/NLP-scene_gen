<L>__{interior reptiles and amphibians room day}
<A>__{larry and henry emerge and walk wide eyed among the cases of lizards, chameleons, tortoises. high windows light the room. outside the sun is going down. a woman pushing a child in a stroller exits and the boys have the hall to themselves.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{look at this. a komodo dragon.}
<A>__{as larry checks out, the huge, dragon like reptile, which has just sunk its jaws into a stuffed boar. henry points to a stuffed gecko climbing vertically up the side of its case.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{check out this one. it can walk up walls.}
<A>__{larry already has his eyes on the far end of the hall where temporary barricades have been put up to prevent access to the next room. painting is in progress. scaffolding just begs to be climbed. henry runs over and starts up the scaffolding. larry hesitates.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{we're not supposed to go back there.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{chicken. this is a great short cut.}
<A>__{henry drops on the other side of the scaffolding and larry follows. in a moment both disappear from sight.}
