<A>__{bud elbow crawls over the dirt, between wooden pilings. there's a long burlap sack ahead. it smells bad. bud rips burlap. a rat's nest explodes. bud sweeps a forearm at them. as they clear, he sees a gristle caked human skull staring back, a .38 hole in the forehead. undaunted, bud tears the burlap back further. he pats the corpse's pockets, comes up with a wallet. bud checks the id. "turner meeks." bus knows him by that name and another.}
