<A>__{he's at the end of the pier, his feet dangling in the muddy water of the port. a few feet away a pump sends air hissing through a rubber tube to the diver trapped below. enzo inhales steadily, his chest heaving like a bellow. he carefully puts his spectacles inside his shoes, dons his flippers, etc., with his usual flair of suspense. behind him the supervisor and other construction workers watch expectantly. roberto heaves a stone weight into the bay, a cable attached to it plays out from a drum on the pier. enzo ignoring everyone, grabs the ordinary tire jack, flip flops over to the now taut cable, the stone has hit bottom. he takes a deep breath and dives into the bay. underwater wreck enzo dives down a chimney of muck. picks his way over and around every hazard, until he reaches the diver, trapped under a huge piece of debris. he pats his shoulder to comfort him, he then inserts the tire jack under a piece of concrete... and, as if he were changing a tire, begins to pump the handle... slowly, in a swirl of mud and water, the chunk of debris rises off the diver's leg.}
