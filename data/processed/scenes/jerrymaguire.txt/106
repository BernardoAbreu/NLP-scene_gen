<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{jerry and ray have a great conversation, playing tug with a piece of rope.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{and then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and i love the zoo. do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?}
<C>__{jerry}

<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{jerry }
<D>__{all my life i've been trying to talk, really talk, and no one wants to listen. you know that feeling?}
<A>__{ray nods vigorously.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{let's go right now. let's go to the zoo.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{aw, the fucking thing... i mean, the zoo is closed.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you said "fuck".}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{yeah i know. i did.}
<A>__{ray loves this guy. he pats jerry's knee.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i won't tell.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{we'll go to the zoo sometime. okay? i think i might have some time on my hands.}
<A>__{ray looks at jerry's hands.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i don't see any.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(points respectfully)}
<D>__{funny.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{funny...}
<P>__{(imitates him) (hears mom approaching)}
<D>__{i better go to bed.}
<A>__{ray hugs jerry and exits. jerry sits contemplating the kid for a moment. the door swings open and a harried dorothy appears in the sexier top, but with a distinctly less sexy attitude, and a tray.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{drinks. food. plus, i called you a cab.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(slightly confused)}
<D>__{good idea. thank you.}
<A>__{and we should keep our voices down a little. i have a little boy asleep.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{right. of course.}
<A>__{jerry tries to twist open the beer, ripping at his palm. it's not a twist off. she hands him an opener. he opens it, inelegantly.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{so. our company.}
<A>__{she watches the drunken man, who drinks. then coughs a little. then stands.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{okay. lil' speech before i go.}
<A>__{he gets up, woozy, but loose. powerfully:}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{do. not. worry. about. your. job.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{our company is in good shape. you and your son... we... are just fine. you still have a job. i want you to feel confident! in. me. and i have a problem with people who talk about themselves in the third person, but let me tell you something about jerry maguire.}
<A>__{his confidence nicely fueled, jerry reaches for a fireplace poker. he begins to joust with an imaginary opponent.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{come after me and you will lose i am a survivor! do not underestimate jerry maguire! i've got wits!}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{jerry }
<D>__{i've got the instincts of a panther!}
<P>__{(joust)}
<D>__{i've got dorothy boyd on my side!}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{don't worry about me. i can get jobs }
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{we will be fine!}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{ especially one like this.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{and i am...}
<A>__{he becomes very aware of himself. acting out in a virtual stranger's small but comfortable living room.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i am drunk.}
<A>__{he collapses onto the sofa, embarrassed. shaking his head. dorothy scoots closer in an adjacent chair. she breaks the personal barrier, carefully touching his wound with the wet tip of the aloe vera plant.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{truth?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{dorothy turns to see that laurel's two shoes are still very visible at the kitchen door. decides to ignore them. she gets closer.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{sure, i care about the job. of course. but mostly...}
<P>__{(very honest)}
<D>__{... i want to be inspired.}
<A>__{there is something inspiring about the way she says the word "inspiring."}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{me too.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{what you wrote inspired me.}
<A>__{he is catching a scent of that most ancient elixer. a woman's affection. their heads inch closer together.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i'm working with you because of that memo...}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{mission... statement...}
<A>__{they kiss. it turns rather passionate. she places a cool hand on his cheek. he places a hand on her breast. the taxi beeps outside. she pulls away. both regard the hand on her breast.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{well.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{sorry about this hand.}
<P>__{(he rises unsteadily)}
<D>__{you know that feeling you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{don't worry about it, boss.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{oh shit. you said "boss."}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{yeah, i did.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{now i feel like clarence thomas.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{no. no don't feel like clarence thomas.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{no, i do. i feel like clarence thomas.}
<P>__{(the worst day ever)}
<D>__{i'm like... harrassing you... right now.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{i may not sue.}
<A>__{he laughs a little. music. unsure what more to say, jerry rubs his face. and then:}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{well, good evening.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{good evening.}
<A>__{he stands, returns the fireplace poker to her, and exits. stumbling slightly on the first step leading down from the front porch, he recovers with style.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{we'll be okay. and i'm going to take my... one client and we're gonna go all the way.}
<A>__{he takes a few more steps, re balancing bags, coughs a little. he is a mess, and he knows it.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing; loving the dark humor)}
<D>__{hey. i'm back.}
<A>__{she laughs, waves, and exits back into the kitchen. she regards the poker still in her hand. laurel watches her conflicted, slightly lovesick sister.}
