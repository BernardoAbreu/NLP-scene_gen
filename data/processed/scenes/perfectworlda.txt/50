<L>__{interior airstream day}
<A>__{sally enters, balancing the boxes, and glares at the faces surrounding her. a smiling red, a grinning adler messily gorging on a cinnamon roll, a nervous kaiser, the radio man, and, in the corner, a nasty smirk from bobby lee. when the airstream takes off again, she loses her balance and drops one of the boxes. adler and suttle jump forward to help but she gives them the evil eye.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i've got it.}
<A>__{she kneels down to pick it up and feels eyes on her. she looks up to the men staring at... her skirt, raised a bit, exposing a thigh. she calmly stands and looks to adler, a piece of cinnamon roll dangling on his chin.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{you've got shit on your face.}
<A>__{red can't help but smile as adler wipes at his face.}
