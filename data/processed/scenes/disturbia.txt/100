<T>__{time cut to:}
<L>__{interior kale's bedroom night short time later}
<A>__{kale and ronnie watch the video of ronnie's break in. they're cracking themselves up as we see on the tv ronnie's feet stumbling through the garage, the camera sliding away off the trunk of the mustang, ronnie diving for it.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{hey, i caught that.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{so that's when the garage door started closing.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yeah, he must have heard me. he came through the inside door }
<P>__{(re: tv screen)}
<D>__{this is where i ducked low and started...}
<A>__{on the tv ronnie's feet start motoring across the concrete floor, racing through the doorway onto the hardwood floor...}
<C>__{ronnie }
<D>__{...hauling aaaass...}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{that's great.}
<A>__{on the tv as before, we're mostly watching ronnie's feet as they scamper around giles' house. then the camera falls away, slides across the floor toward that bookcase, its pov for a split second aiming under the bookcase.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{dropped it.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{yeah, i lost signal }
<A>__{on the tv this we didn't see earlier the camera is quickly scooped up by ronnie whose feet dart across giles' entry hall floor toward the front door. we see ronnie's hand reach for the knob.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{but i never leave evidence behind.}
<A>__{on the tv ronnie's feet dart out giles' front door and into the darkness of the yard...}
<C>__{ronnie }
<D>__{and that's about when you started yelling bloody murder and the shit hit the fan.}
<A>__{the tv screen goes black.}
<C>__{ronnie }
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{i'm starving. all that running around...}
<A>__{ronnie heads from the room.}
<C>__{kale}
<P>__{(re: video)}
<D>__{i'm gonna burn this.}
<A>__{kale gets up, heads to the camera. about to eject the tape, when a thought stops him. he pulls the camera off the tv, sits on the floor, presses "play", scans back through the tape. on the tv the same footage. nothing glaring stands out. the camera falls from ronnie's hand, slides to the bookcase. ronnie quickly scoops the camera up, keeps running...}
<C>__{kale }
<D>__{you're not fooling me, giles...}
<A>__{kale scans the tape back again, this time just to the point where ronnie drops the camera. on kale his eyes suddenly narrow did he see something? kale scans back again.}
