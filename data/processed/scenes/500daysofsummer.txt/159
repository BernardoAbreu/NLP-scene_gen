<A>__{tom and summer shopping at the fruit market. unless we were looking for trouble we wouldn't see any. but since we are, we might notice she lags behind him as they walk through the aisles. his hands are in his pockets. he's bored. she's distant. but only if we're really looking. (406)}
<L>__{interior apartment later}
<A>__{tom, almost with a full beard, is redecorating his apartment again. we see him rearranging the furniture in the room. later. he hangs some new pictures. later. he uses a pencil on the wall to mark for a bookshelf. then he uses a ruler to make sure his marks are even. he draws a faint line on the wall to mark where he needs to nail something.
