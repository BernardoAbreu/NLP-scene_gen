<L>__{interior science classroon later}
<A>__{the kids all have bananas and condoms. they are in various stages of putting the condom over the banana. anita walks among them, clearly more comfortable with her role now.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{okay. i know it's hard.}
<A>__{titters from the group.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{difficult. but safe sex is really important. i try to practice it every day.}
<A>__{josie reacts. angle on kirsten & kristen. their condoms are snugly on their bananas. they stare at josie.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{wait, rewind. do you really think she hooked up with our rob? they're so different.}
<C>__{gibby}
<D>__{sometimes opposites attract.}
<C>__{kirsten}
<D>__{yeah. look at bert and ernie.}
<A>__{we angle on anita. she's walking authoritatively up the aisle towards the front.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{so just..imagine the bananas are the real thing.}
<A>__{she takes a rather large banana off a desk and looks at it. she snorts.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{in a land called "every man's fantasy".}
<A>__{she looks up, sees the real miss kitterman (we can tell from the model of a uterus she carries), standing outside the door and waving. without missing a beat, anita pulls down a shade on the door and locks it. angle on: josie and tracy still struggling with condoms.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{god, i can't do this.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{you know what, though? i feel like i'm really ready to do it. to have sex for the first time.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{wow. that's big. i mean sex is a really big deal. you shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.}
<A>__{angle on sam, listening. josie is oblivious.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{you know, adele penguins pick one mate. they spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. that's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{but i'm not a penguin.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's an analogy.}
<A>__{a surprised josie looks up to see sam next to her. she lets her condom go. and it flies off her banana into his face. josie turns to tracy.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{excuse me. i have to go die now.}
<A>__{the class is interrupted by sydney over the loudspeaker:}
<C>__{sydney }
<P>__{(over speaker)}
<D>__{hey guys sydney again! don't forget no going into the library cuz of that little asbestos problem. and about prom—}
<A>__{everyone freezes. dead silence.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{really bad news. we just got the word from intelligence northglen high is doing the millennium too!}
<A>__{complete chaos. screaming terror. a girl faints. sera squeezes her banana so hard it oozes out of its skin. other kids are beating their bananas against desktops. brett, the football player, absentmindedly peels his banana and begins eating it.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{all right guys, let's calm down. calm down.}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{sit!}
<A>__{they all do, including anita.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{now look. let's focus. prom theme. we need a new idea.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{oh! how about "under the sea?"}
<A>__{she's met with a round of "boos". anita reacts.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{well excuse me.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what about the "roaring twenties"… or "the 80's"?}
<A>__{the class lets out a giant groan on that one.}
<C>__{gibby}
<D>__{what do you think we are? amateurs?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{josie.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{that's not a theme.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{no, josie will have the answer.}
<A>__{a long beat. expectant faces all turn to josie. she looks at tracy.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{how about '}
<P>__{(coming to her)}
<D>__{meant for each other famous couples throughout history?}
<A>__{another beat as the class considers.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(smiles and nods)}
<D>__{yeah. that's it.}
<A>__{the class suddenly concurs.}
<C>__{class}
<D>__{yeah. that's it. rufus.}
<A>__{josie soaks in all the approval like a sponge.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{thanks. thank you.}
<A>__{josie looks from sam and anita's smiling faces to find guy smiling at her. close up on a banner reading: "millennium". it comes down, replaced by one that reads: "meant for each other... widen}
