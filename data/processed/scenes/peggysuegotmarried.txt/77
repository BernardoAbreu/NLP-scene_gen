<D>__{it's great. i cleaned the car, do you like it? oh, i got tickets for fabian on your birthday, you like him, right? he's cool. eighteen is half of thirty six. it's "gentlemen start your engines", vroom, like i'm gassed up ready for the race. i've got the girl, i've got the car, i've got the talent, but i don't know. do i date, get married, join the army, cut a record, go to college? i got a million choices, but nobody teaches you how to choose. but it's different for a girl. you're lucky. you just have to wait for me.}
