<C>__{milton}
<D>__{i remember her! she was a bit player in a couple of my movies. a nobody! so what does it matter?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{oh, come on! you have made millions off the story of her murder. you're obsessed with her and you're obsessed with her daughter!}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{settle down beavis.}
<P>__{(to milton)}
<D>__{why don't you tell us the truth?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{what the hell are you guys getting at? i make horror films, that's what i do. the studio came to me with 'stab'. they came to me, check it out.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{but you know who she was.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{when we did the first 'stab" i realized i'd known maureen prescott before, i mean as rina. i couldn't tell anyone. can you imagine the press?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{and now? i mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{get real, that would make me a suspect!}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{just because you knew her?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{i don't think so! just what happened to maureen when she was in hollywood?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{now you listen to me, lois lane, let it go. it's dead and buried. daddy took ol' yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over national tv? why don't you start talking.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{it was in the 70's, everything was different. i was well known for my parties, rina knew what they were. it was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression. nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{are you saying she was }
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{i'm saying things got out of hand. maybe they did take advantage of her!. maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence. no charges were brought. and the bottom line is, rina reynolds wouldn't play by the rules. you wanna get ahead in hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.}
