<A>__{the two old women we have seen before sit on their sofa gazing straight ahead. on the teievision in front of them, a live picture of truman the first time we have seen him broadcast to a viewer's set. he is reading a book at his kitchen table, unaware of the cameras recording him. the scene alternates between a wide master shot, a medium tight shot, a close up of truman's face and two insert shots one over the shoulder shot of the page he is reading and one from another angle showing the book's title, "to the ends of the earth the age of exploration". at one point, a sponsor's border appears on screen, tastefully framing the "action" with the message, "folgers coffee good to the last drop." after several seconds, the border disappears. suddenly tbe live picture of truman shrinks into a window on the screen to accomodate a title sequence that begins to piay around the edge of the image. overlapping scenes from truman's life appear in chronological order, from infancy to adolescence and finally adulthood. a graphic, "truman total record of a human life", appears on screen accompanied by an introductory narration.}
