<D>__{i've got nothing to say to you.}

<A>__{adrian enters. he has his travel bag in one hand. he looks at laura and gathers himself.}

<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{but you were doing a good job.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{sure, if your name's da vinci or picasso. but if you're some young talent in podunk, texas, sorry you're not famous enough. people like you and anheuser and my father you think you can play god.}

<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{you know what your father believed. that nature will choose itself from itself.}

<D>__{zero. what's your point?}
<A>__{adrian pulls out the book from his bag. he shows her.}

<A>__{laura looks at him sadly, but with a little hope.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i need to know that too, adrian.}
<A>__{adrian moves for the door. he stops.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{one more thing. your father told me you were the most precious thing to him in the whole world... you are to me too.}
