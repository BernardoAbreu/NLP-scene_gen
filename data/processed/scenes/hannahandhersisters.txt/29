<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior street outside frederick's loft day}
<A>__{the movie briefly holds on a ripped, red, paint splattered door as elliot, wearing a raincoat, appears nearby. he looks down the street and the film cuts to his point of view: frederick's loft building. the movie goes back to the impatient elliot; he's looking around him. he glances at his watch as the film cuts back once again to the loft building, where lee finally appears, walking down the street away from elliot. a truck passes down the street. lee doesn't see him. she walks further and further away; she turns a corner. elliot frantically looks around again; then, in a burst of decision, he runs around a garbage dump, crossing the street, and still running, he moves down an adjacent street, past the canal lumber company and several other buildings, as the film cuts back to lee, walking down a different street, oblivious. the jazz plays on as the movie cuts back and forth between the fast moving elliot, rushing down the soho streets, past a truck waiting for a light to change, past some pedestrians, some garbage cans, turning corners, and the strolling lee, walking up different streets, past different buildings. lee eventually crosses a street, lost in thought, looking right and left, as elliot, pretending nonchalance, waits on the corner, looking at his watch. she looks up in surprise; the music stops.}

<D>__{yeah, sure.}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{they begin to walk again as the movie cuts to the interior of the pageant book & print shop, an old, serious bookstore. a nude print hangs at the end of one of the library shelf like bookcases, which are packed, row after row, with books. an unseen elliot and lee carry on a conversation as the camera moves down an aisle, past the rows of books. a piano playing "bewitched" is heard. pictures hang on the aisle ends of the shelves.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{isn't this great?}

<D>__{unless, of course, if if you had some time, i mean, we could get some coffee.}
<C>__{lee}
