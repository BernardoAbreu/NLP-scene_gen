<A>__{back and forth between ryuji, who is beginning to visibly panic, and the television, which shows sadako lurching ever closer.}

<P>__{(almost frantic)}
<D>__{why?!}
<A>__{the telephone rings, and ryuji spins round towards it, breath catching in his throat. he looks at the phone, over his shoulder at the television, back to the phone.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{thats it! asakawa...}
<A>__{ryuji scrambles wildly towards the phone. he takes the receiver but is unable to do more than clutch it fearfully as his gaze is drawn inexorably back to the television. sadakos shrouded face has filled the entire screen... and then, television popping and crackling, she jerks forward and emerges from the television onto the floor of ryujis apartment. ryuji backs away, screaming in terror.}

<D>__{aaargh!}
<A>__{sadako lies prone, collapsed, hair splayed out like a drowned corpse. only her fingers are active, crawling, feeling. the tips of her fingers are little more than bloodied stumps, not a single fingernail on them. she uses the strength in those fingers to pull herself forward, coming jerkily to her feet. the joints of her body twist unnaturally, more insect like than human. ryuji flings the phone aside and begins scrambling about the apartment as if looking for cover. the strength has already begun to fade from his body, however, and his movements are clumsy, exaggerated. he falls to the floor, panting heavily. sadako turns to regard him, and for just an instant we can see beneath her impenetrable shroud of hair; a single eye burns with manic, unbridled hatred. its gaze meets ryujis, and his face twists into a grimace as he screams loudly.}
