<A>__{near the pig pen, a dozen suspects are being led away on ropes by tubbs, warren, rodriguez. the others left behind look back at their village in ruins, homes burning, livestock dead or scattered, belongings thrown and broken in the dirt. babies wail, the adults squat there on their heels watching with absolutely no trace of outward emotion. past this bosch like canvas, chris carrying the girl walks dazed by the horrors of this long afternoon.}
