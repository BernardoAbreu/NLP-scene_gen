<A>__{close on freddy's face, looking at himself in a mirror. he's pulling back his eyelid; his eyes are bloodshot and he's sweating. freddy then pushes the mirror shut and we see edgar, silhouetted in the bathroom doorway.}

<D>__{you scared the shit out of me. hey, the police woman. she's real sick. to tell the truth i don't feel so hot myself.}
<A>__{edgar approaches, still silhouetted.}

<D>__{but i'm sick. she's given me something...}
<A>__{edgar moves incredibly fast, we can't quite see what he has done but we suspect he has just buried his hand in freddy's chest. we see freddy's face, stunned, deathly white.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{what have i said to you?}
<A>__{freddy falls, leaving edgar's hand in mid air; we can't see clearly, but it likes frighteningly like he has one of freddy's internal organs in his hand.}
<C>__{edgar}

<D>__{i hate arguments.}
