<L>__{6.7's grasp to the floor. dead.}
<A>__{sid 6.7 stares at parker in disbelief. blood is now visible flowing from a bullet hole in sid 6.7's shoulder, which was caused by the same bullet. sid 6.7's arm dangles uselessly. his gun lies on the floor.}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<P>__{(surprised, but pleased).}
<D>__{you and me aren't so different, after all...}
<A>__{parker again pulls the trigger. click. click, click. no bullets.}
<C>__{sid 6.7 }

<A>__{he takes off around the corner. grabbing another clip from inside his uniform, parker goes after him. only to stumble over something. sid 6.7's bowling bag. blood flows through its zipper. you now realize the object inside is not a bowling ball. beside the bowling bag lies john's body, which is convulsing. his hands have been tied to bare electrical wire. john is being electrocuted. parker kicks away the wires, but not in time.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{he scans the room for sid 6.7. parker has no idea sid 6.7 is standing directly behind him. sid 6.7 grabs parker by the throat.}

<A>__{the scene continues seamlessly. sid 6.7's skin heals over his shoulder wound once his internal parts are back in their proper places. no scar whatsoever. his clothing also returns to perfect condition. literally, as good as new. this is known as automatic resetting. the previously dead busboy also auto resets. his wound healing by itself. we pull back further to reveal the monitor is one of several}
<B>__{inside the law enforcement technology advancement center}
<A>__{a k a letac. the facility is a converted aerospace research building in pacoima. funded by government black book dollars. the look is a mixture of industrial grime and high tech sparkle. banks upon banks of computer equipment. wires, cables, conduits, connectors everywhere you look. in complete disarray to the uninitiated. but to those in the know, this is the most advanced facility of its kind in the world. the building is partitioned into dozens of stations. at each station, a leading engineer in his field is frantically readying a prototype for demonstration. each new technology designed to help fight the new cold war... the war on crime. the atmosphere is competitive. voices are loud. tension, anticipation in the air. only a lucky few will have their inventions approved for production. letac is, quite simply, los alamos from 1940 meets sega from}
