<A>__{smecker is chain smoking. his clothes appear unkempt. his eyes show emotion at every new found clue. the detectives watch closely. he is hunched over the body of the fat man probing his wounds with his gloved fingers. greenly has re entered. he defiantly holds a cup of coffee but is too intimidated to interrupt smecker. he sets it down and folds his arms.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{i've seen burns like these before. they used silencers. look at these entry and exit wounds. they're identical.}
<A>__{he stands up and gives a lesson to the now eager detectives. he points his two index fingers to the back of his own skull.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{the two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss crossed and exited through the eyeballs. this one clue tells us three distinct facts. number one... duffy.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{they shot him at a downward angle.}
<P>__{(makes connection)}
<D>__{they put him on his knees.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{excellent! number two. greenly.}
<C>__{greenly}
<D>__{uh.}
<P>__{(thinking hard)}
<D>__{shit, i, uh...}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{it tells us that he was the last to die. all these men}
<P>__{(fans across the}
<D>__{corpses with his}
<P>__{hand)}
<D>__{were carrying. they came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. didn't they, duffy?!}
<P>__{(psychotic laugh)}
<D>__{they sure as fuck did!}
<A>__{a wide eyed duffy joins with smecker, by nodding his head. smecker is seducing all of them.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{and number three, dolly.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{uh... two shooters!}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{fan fuckin tastic!}
<A>__{greenly and duffy want to know how.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{now stay with me, boys. what did they do to make two such identical wounds? did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? no. two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! that's all she fuckin' wrote!}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{what about one guy with two guns?}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{possible, but unlikely. the angles are too extreme. a guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. he wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? no way. had to be at least two.}
