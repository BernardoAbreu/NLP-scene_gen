<A>__{eddie takes lindy's hands, sits her on the bed.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{we'll stay here for a couple of days. we'll be powered up, we'll be able to think our way out of this...}
<A>__{he kisses her hands. looks into her eyes.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{i'm back. all right?}
<A>__{lindy looks at him for a long moment.}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{who's back, eddie?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i can take care of you now.}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{that was never what i wanted.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{a lot's going to happen for us. and everything that i will have... i will share with you. i will love you.}
<A>__{lindy's head comes up. she looks at him, steely.}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{you know... you were always smart. you could have done this. not this... but some of these things... maybe a third of these things... without any smart drug at all. a third of all this... to most people...? ...would be plenty.}
<A>__{she gets up, turns away from him.}
<C>__{lindy }
<D>__{i understand that stuff now, eddie. and i don't blame you for taking it. no one could ever tell you, till you take it, what it can do. invincibility in a bottle. and i know i'm going to think about taking it again every day for the rest of my life.}
<A>__{there's eerie quiet to her tone that eddie hasn't heard before. a matter of fact chill.}
<C>__{lindy }
<D>__{but once you can see everything that way, mapped out like that, on a grid... and always be right...? who'd want to wing it? who'd want to fuck up? who'd want to be human?}
<A>__{she heads for the door.}
<C>__{lindy }
<D>__{i just came up to say goodbye. i don't ever want to see you again. i'm not even going to stay in new york. don't try to find me, and don't try to help me.}
<A>__{she goes. he knows there's no point in stopping her. she's done with him.}
