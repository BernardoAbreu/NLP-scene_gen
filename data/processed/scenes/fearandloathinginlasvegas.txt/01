<B>__{at the wheel}
<A>__{strangely still and tense, raoul duke drives skeletal, beer in hand stares straight ahead. beside him, face turned to the sun, eyes closed behind wraparound spanish sunglasses, is his swarthy and unnervingly unpredictable attorney, dr. gonzo. the music pounds duke stares straight ahead. gonzo froths up a can of beer uses it as shaving foam.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{i remember saying something like: "i feel a bit lightheaded. maybe you should drive..."}
<A>__{gonzo starts shaving.}

<D>__{suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and screeching and diving around the car...}
<A>__{close on duke shadows flutter across his face. the reflections of bats swirl within his eyes. we push in close to one eye ball screeching swirling bat like shapes! aaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgggggggggghhhhhh!!!!!!!!}
