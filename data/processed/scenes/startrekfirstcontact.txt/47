<L>__{interior missile silo control room}
<A>__{this is the "mission control" for cochrane's test site. the underground room is filled with 21st century equipment, consoles and monitors. one entire wall of the room is dominated by a huge metal blast door, which is now closed. we will learn that on the other side of that door is the nuclear missile warp ship itself. the ceiling has partially collapsed. chunks of concrete and fallen beams have destroyed some of the equipment...only a few of the consoles are active, most are dark or fritzing sporadically. the lights are out, and the room is illuminated by a few smoldering fires. four dead bodies can be seen strewn around the room. it's a scene of destruction.}
<B>__{picard}
<A>__{and his team enter the dark and smoking ruin. beverly and picard move to one of the dead men, while geordi and the security guards move to the other three. beverly rolls the man onto his back he's clearly dead. the name stitched on his uniform says rippert. picard looks up.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(to others)}
<D>__{see if any of these men are cochrane.}
<A>__{geordi and the guards start checking the dead bodies.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{mitchell... depaul...}
<C>__{lange}
<D>__{this one's a woman... named kirby.}
<A>__{picard and beverly move toward the immense blast door. as beverly scans it, picard glances at a nearby desk...}
<B>__{the desk}
<A>__{is littered with debris and various documents and schematics. three photographs are pinned to a bulletin board above the desk they show zephram cochrane and two angles of his warp ship. the photos are odd looking, printed on what appears to be some sort of cloth.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{there's a life sign behind this door... about ten meters below.}
<A>__{geordi moves to the door.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{blast door. it's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{there should be some kind of manual release...}
<A>__{they hunt around for a moment. geordi runs his hand along the edge of the blast door. picard turns to the guards.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(to lange)}
<D>__{get those fires out and then try to restore main power to the control room.}
<C>__{lange}
<D>__{aye, sir.}
<A>__{the guards move off.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{got it, captain.}
<A>__{geordi has found an emergency box with several pneumatic tubes and a hydraulic lever labeled "emergency use only." he pulls down the lever, there is a hissing sound, and the blast door slowly slides down into the floor. we can now see the missile silo itself beyond the door. picard, geordi and beverly step into...}
