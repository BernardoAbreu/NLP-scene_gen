<L>__{interior whale's house studio day}
<A>__{clay opens the squeaking door and enters behind hanna. whale stands at a drafting table, sharpening a pencil. hanna sets the tray down.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{very good, hanna. now goodbye.}
<A>__{she goes toward the door, wrinkling her forehead at clay. the screen door bangs shut.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i'm sure you'd like something to wet your whistle while i work.}
<A>__{whale opens a bottle of beer, pours it into a glass, hands it to clay. he gestures to a chair.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{we'll go slowly today. since this is your first time as a model.}
<A>__{clay sits. he pulls a "tv guide" out of his back pocket.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{did you see this? they're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you don't say? which picture?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{"bride of frankenstein."}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{hmmm. i much prefer "show boat" or "the invisible man." shall we begin?}
<A>__{clay takes a swig of beer and sets the glass on the floor.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{ready when you are.}
<A>__{whale stares at clay.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{that shirt, mr. boone.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{it's new.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it's too white, too distracting. would it be asking too much for you to take it off?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i'm not wearing an undershirt.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{pish posh, mr. boone. i'm not your aunt tilly.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{but it's just my face you want to draw.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable...}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{perhaps we can find something else for you to wear.}
<A>__{he lifts a drop cloth off a footlocker, revealing a stack of "physique" magazines. whale casually covers them with a newspaper.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{we could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders. would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{all right already. i will take it off. kind of warm in here anyway.}
<A>__{he unbuttons the shirt and pulls it off.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{yes. much better.}
<P>__{(steps forward)}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{clay adjusts his belt buckle as whale hangs the shirt on a wall peg. he moves back to the easel again.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i think we'll have you sit slightly sideways, so you can rest one arm on the back of the chair. yes. just so.}
<A>__{the arm with the tattoo faces the easel. clay smirks.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{take a picture, it lasts longer.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{that's exactly what i intend to do.}
<A>__{a clatter of pencils in the easel's tray, followed by a moment of silence. finally, a low, whistly scratch. clay concentrates on keeping still, focusing on an open window.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you seem to have no idea how handsome you are, mr. boone. it has to do with how snugly your face fits your skull.}
<A>__{clay wipes a thin line of sweat from his waist.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{would you be more comfortable barefoot? feel free to remove your boots and socks.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{no. i'm fine.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{it's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it? you have to remain perfectly still while i examine and scrutinize you.}
<A>__{whale suddenly sniffs, as if smelling something. he sniffs several times more but continues to draw.}
<C>__{whale}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{dripping?}
<P>__{(to clay)}
<D>__{do you ever eat dripping in this country? the fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars. used like butter on bread.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{sounds like something you feed the dog.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{it is. only the poorest families ever ate it. we kept ours in a crockery jar.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{your family ate dripping?}
<C>__{whale}
<P>__{(catching himself)}
<D>__{of course not. as i said, only poor people }
<A>__{whale stops. he lets out a bitter laugh.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i've spent most of my life outrunning my past. now it's flooding all over me.}
<A>__{clay stares out blankly.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{there's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth. yes, my family ate dripping. beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley. are you also from the slums, mr. boone?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{we weren't rich. but we weren't poor either.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{no, you were middle class, like all americans.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{in dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any american can imagine. every englishman knows his place. and if you forget, there's always someone to remind you. my family had no doubts about who they were. but i was an aberration in that household a freak of nature. i had imagination, cleverness, joy. where did i get that? certainly not from them.}
<A>__{whale's voice has changed, becoming more pinched and nasal.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{they took me out of school when i was fourteen and put me in a factory. they meant no harm. they were like a family of farmers who've been given a giraffe, and don't know what to do with the creature except harness him to the plow.}
<A>__{whale seems completely lost in the past by now.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{hatred was the only thing that kept my soul alive in that soul killing place. and among those men i hated was my own poor, dumb father. who put me in that hell to begin with.}
<A>__{whale peers out from behind the square of paper. he pales when he sees his father william, his face covered with grime, glaring at him from across the room. whale retreats behind the pad, takes a breath.}
<C>__{clay }
<D>__{mr. whale?}
<A>__{relief floods whale's face. he looks out, smiles at clay.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you have to excuse me, mr. boone. since my stroke, i am often overcome with nostalgia.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i don't mind. i'm not crazy about my old man either.}
<A>__{whale rubs a hand across his eyes and steps into the open.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{why don't we break for five minutes? you probably want to stretch your legs.}
<A>__{whale pulls the cover sheet over the pad to hide what he's drawn so far.}
<C>__{dwight }
<D>__{so you just sat there while this old limey banged his gums?}
