<D>__{...just take care of my sister.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{your sister? she returned from the mountain weak and cold. she said you froze her heart.}

<D>__{what? no.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{i tried to save her, but it was too late. her skin was ice. her hair turned white...}

<C>__{hans }
<D>__{your sister is dead... because of you.}
<A>__{elsa drops to her knees, emotionally broken. and with that, the swirling storm suddenly stops. the snow freezes mid air, hangs suspended, trapped in grief. citizens and dignitaries rush to the wall's edge and look out to see... anna, barely able to move but now able to see across the fjords to...}

<D>__{anna.}
<A>__{anna pushes on towards kristoff. he runs top speed towards her. there's still a lot of fjord to cross, but kristoff is giving it all he's got. he's going to make it. but then, anna hears the sound of a sword being drawn from its scabbard. she turns and sees hans, behind elsa, as he raises his sword over his head.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{elsa.}
<A>__{anna looks back at kristoff as he runs for her. she gives him a longing look, but then turns away from him and then... using all of her remaining strength, as hans brings his sword down, anna throws herself in front of elsa.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{in that instant, anna freezes to solid ice. the sword hits her instead of elsa. the sword shatters completely. the force of it sends hans flying back and knocks him out.}

<A>__{elsa hugs anna and cries. kristoff watches in shocked despair. sven steps up to his side. citizens and dignitaries on the castle walls bow their heads. all of arendelle is joined in somber silence. but then, anna warms. she begins to thaw. olaf looks up and gasps. kristoff and sven notice, light up. anna bends her arm and embraces elsa.}

<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{love.}
<A>__{elsa lifts her arms, and the ground shakes and cracks. the ice and snow breaks away and rises high into the air. beneath their feet the bow of a ship thaws. the entire fjord melts and other boats right themselves. the villagers come out to see the warmth returning. in one final wave, elsa draws all of the snow into a giant snowflake in the sky, then waves it away, leaving only a warm summer day.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i knew you could do it.}
<C>__{olaf}
<P>__{(melting, good naturedly)}

<D>__{oh, olaf. hang on, little guy.}
<A>__{elsa waves her hand and surrounds olaf with a swirl of cold air. he refreezes. above his head she leaves a little, perpetually snowing storm cloud. olaf loves it.}

<A>__{kristoff sees hans trying to get to his feet. he marches toward him, prepared for a fight. but anna puts up a hand and stops him.}

<D>__{uh. uh. uh.}
<A>__{she'll handle this. she goes over to hans.}
<C>__{hans}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{anna? but she froze your heart.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{the only frozen heart around here is yours.}
<A>__{she turns away from him, proud of her words. but not yet satisfied, she turns back and punches him right in the face.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{ah! whoa, whoa, whoa!}
<A>__{he falls overboard. elsa comes over to anna and hugs her. over her shoulder, kristoff meets anna's eyes. she smiles brighter, happy.}
