<A>__{fred is standing in the living room looking in the direction of the stairwell. we hear someone's steps coming up the stairs. it's renee, who eventually comes into view. she is holding another manila envelope. she arrives at the top step. she and fred lock eyes. fred takes the envelope, opens it, and pulls out a third videotape. without saying anything, fred takes the tape to the vcr. he inserts it very carefully, slowly. he hits play, turns on the television and he and renee sit down on the couch together and begin to watch with great apprehension. again we begin with a wide shot and then the tv monitor fills the screen: we see the interior of the house at night. the camera glides looking down from a high angle along the hallway and into the bedroom, where fred and renee are sleeping. again, the droning sound plays throughout. in the bedroom where fred and renee are seen sleeping, suddenly, fred, on the tape, slowly awakens as the camera holds on him. he rises and turns unnaturally in the bed, as if drawn up by his awareness of some strange presence in the room. he comes to a sitting position, his head straining upwards, looking in the direction of the camera. at this point, the videotape image turns to snow.}
