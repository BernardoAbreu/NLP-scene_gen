<A>__{hector is lying awake, watching bobby's sleeping form on the ground at the other side of the dying fire. behind bobby is a wolf, sniffing and edging his way closer to them. hector isn't anxious. he knows the wolf will soon become aware of them and move off. he is worried about something else. from under the pack that makes his pillow he pulls a piece of broken arrow, a shaft and some feathers, the other end of bobby's find. he looks at it, then looks back to bobby and the wolf.}
