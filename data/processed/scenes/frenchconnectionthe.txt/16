<B>__{the titles commence the french connection}
<A>__{titles over a close shot of a chorus line, with lots of tits and ass and lean, long legs in a brassy blare of music. we zoom back to the area where doyle and russo are beginning to occupy a table. russo takes the seat on the right, eyes immediately on all that ginch, while doyle standing, gives their order. we do not hear the dialogue but doyle asks russo what he wants buddy looks up and says "cinzano." doyle turns and says "two of these." doyle slips into the chair opposite russo and the titles roll on. unlike russo who is concentrating on the girls, doyle is digging the room and the people who occupy the tables in it, as if he is the sort of man who cannot relax until he knows who is around him, why they are there.}
