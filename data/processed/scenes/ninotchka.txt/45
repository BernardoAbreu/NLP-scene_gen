<B>__{close shot of the bed}
<A>__{ninotchka is lying on the bed, still in her evening dress. the diadem is no longer on her head, but no special emphasis is laid on that detail in the camera angle. we hear the sound of the buzzer ringing again and again. ninotchka half wakens and calls out something which sounds like "come in" without being fully aware of what she is doing. bedroom at the door the door is opened from the outside by a maid, who lets in the duchess swana, dressed in a smart morning outfit. swana looks around, surprised and amused at the state of the room. she walks over to the bed where lies ninotchka, still not enough awake to face reality. swana is delighted to have surprised ninotchka in this condition.}

<C>__{swana}
<D>__{it is tomorrow morning... tomorrow noon, to be exact. i hope you will forgive me. i know it's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour. don't you recognize me? i am the duchess swana.}
<A>__{by now ninotchka is awake. she gets up and realizes to her acute embarrassment the condition in which swana has found her.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{i know how you feel, my dear. the morning after always does look grim if you happen to be wearing last night's dress. don't be embarrassed by my presence, though. you couldn't have found anybody more sympathetic to your condition. i remember once in petrograd when i felt exactly as you do. i had to bow from a balcony to the crowd. my dear, the masses have no understanding of the feelings of a lady before noon. don't you find that true?}
<A>__{during swana's speech ninotchka has found herself completely.}
<C>__{ninotchka}

<C>__{swana}
<D>__{of course not, my dear! i didn't come here with any such suspicion. how ridiculous!}

<P>__{(as she reaches the threshold)}
<D>__{how stale last night's gaiety looks! it has the taste of a dead cigarette.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{if you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night i am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.}
<C>__{swana}

<C>__{swana}
<D>__{i just dropped in to have a little heart to heart talk with you.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{we have nothing to discuss.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{now there you are completely wrong. if we sit down for a little chat, i'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.}

<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i must ask you to leave.}
<C>__{swana}

<P>__{(still not understanding)}
<D>__{if this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in petrograd?}

<C>__{swana}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{my palace in petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. you took away my czar, my country, my people, everything i had...}
<P>__{(with emphasis)}
<D>__{but nothing more i warn you.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{people cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. not if you have their love. you hadn't. that's why you're not in russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from moscow? a dissertation on love on soviet stationery would be an amusing paradox.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{it is not enough to be witty, madame. people grow tired of being entertained. you made that mistake before. problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{my dear, you don't know how impressive i could be. did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?}

<C>__{swana}
<D>__{you were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. they're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{where are they?}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{don't worry. fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a russian.}
<P>__{(she draws back the}

<D>__{i just put this on for sentiment. the rest are absolutely safe. i assure you. but if you feel like notifying the police...}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{you leave me no choice.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{won't it be rather embarrassing for a soviet envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i will have to face the consequences, but so will you. don't forget they will ask how you got them.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{that's very simple to answer. they were given to me by my mother. they were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!}

<C>__{ninotchka}

<P>__{(very matter of fact)}
<D>__{now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. our situation has changed considerably. before i had only a claim to the jewels. now i have the jewels.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{in other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. you know that france has recognized the soviet.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{unfortunately.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{under soviet law the jewels belong to the state. france is going to uphold that ownership.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{my lawyer agrees with you. he says france will uphold it in every court, but i will drag you through every court, don't forget that. and when i say it will take two years i am, as always, conservative.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{won't those two years in court be expensive for you? i know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{i may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i see. you have calculated in terms of hunger.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{no, i just wanted to be absolutely impartial. both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. we can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. ninotchka now realizes what she is after.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{i am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five forty plane to moscow.}

<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{that's not the way to win him back... not leon.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{i think i know leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. leave that worry to me. five forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with monsieur mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. i will see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and i will also see you to the airport. that's my proposition, comrade yakushova.}
