<L>__{interior cleveland bar early evening}
<A>__{taylor's having a beer, still trying to decide whether to go see her or not.}
<B>__{taylor}
<A>__{pulling up outside the townhouse he saw lynn go into. he goes up the stairs and knocks on the door. lynn answers, looking more dressed up than when she left the library. she's surprised to see taylor.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{look, lynn, i'm sorry i followed you home but i wanna...}
<C>__{lynn}
<P>__{(hurried)}
<D>__{this isn't my place...}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{whose place is it?}
<A>__{before lynn can answer, tom appears at the door.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{who's there, love?}
<P>__{(spying taylor)}
<D>__{oh, mr. taylor, right?}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{i remember you from the restaurant. lynn's told me a lot about you. why don't you come in for a while?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{nah, that's o.k., i got some things to do...}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{yeh, he's gotta be goin'...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{no, really, come on in for a drink.}
<A>__{before taylor can beg off further, tom ushers him inside and closes the door. in the room are two other couples: arthur holloway, a senior partner in tom's firm and his wife claire, and brent bowden, another lawyer in the firm and a contemporary of tom's. his wife is janice. this is a very upscale group.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{excuse me, everybody, this is jake taylor.}
<P>__{(making the intros)}
<D>__{jake, arthur and claire holloway brent and janice bowden. jake is a professional baseball player.}
<A>__{polite nods from the group, except for janice, who seems somewhat intrigued.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{so, jake, what brings you here this evening?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i, ah, just had a couple books i wanted to discuss with lynn. i thought this was her place.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{well, it soon will be.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{yeh, i heard you guys were engaged. congratulations.}
<A>__{taylor sticks out his hand. tom's not sure whether taylor's putting him on or not. he shakes anyway.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{thank you. what can i get you to drink?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{beer'll be fine.}
<A>__{tom goes off to get the beer.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what team do you play for, jake?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{the indians.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{here in cleveland? i didn't know they still had a team.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{yeh, we have uniforms and everything. it's really great.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(handing jake his beer)}
<D>__{they're last right now, but hopefully moving up, eh, jake?}
<A>__{tom clinks his glass with jake's beer, the slight condescension in his manner not lost on taylor. lynn is uncomfortable with this whole situation. janice moves a bit closer to taylor. it's obvious she finds him attractive.}
<C>__{janice}
<D>__{i'm told that baseball players make very good salaries these days.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{that depends on how good they are, i guess.}
<C>__{janice}
<D>__{how good are you?}
<A>__{lynn is irritated by janice's directness.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i make the league minimum.}
<A>__{tom and the others react as if taylor's just announced a death in the family.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{he was one of the best in baseball until he had problems with his knees.}
<A>__{everyone is somewhat surprised by lynn's quick defense of taylor, including lynn herself.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what are you going to do when your career ends? i mean you can't play baseball forever, can you?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{somethin'll come up.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{will it?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i don't know, i was thinkin' of goin' to hawaii, and having a couple of kids who grow up to be olympic champions.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh really. in what event?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{swimming. maybe the two hundred meter individual medley. i figure it oughta be big by then.}
<A>__{jack just nods. he never heard of it.}
<C>__{brent}
<D>__{you got the girl picked out?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i did, but i wasn't smart enough to hold on to her.}
<A>__{lynn's eyes drop to the floor.}
<C>__{brent}
<D>__{you used to be an athlete, didn't you, lynn?}
<C>__{lynn}
<P>__{(not wanting to pursue it)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{brent}
<D>__{what did you do?}
<C>__{lynn}
<P>__{(reluctant)}
<D>__{two hundred individual medley.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{alternate on the '80 olympic team.}
<A>__{a tense silence settles on the group.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{well, i gotta be goin'. nice to have met you all.}
<A>__{taylor exchanges a quick glance with lynn and heads for the door.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{let me walk you out.}
<A>__{tom accompanies taylor to the door, out of earshot of the others.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{thanks for the beer.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{don't mention it.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i will let you know if i land a good job. i know you're concerned about it.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yeh, well, i just wanted lynn to know what she would've had ahead of her.}
<A>__{tom sticks out his hand. the two men shake to keep up appearances for their onlookers across the room.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{stay away from her.}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{suck my dick.}
