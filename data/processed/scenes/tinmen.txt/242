<A>__{heavy rain is falling. nora, with an umbrella, walks quickly across the parking lot. suddenly bb slips under the umbrella with her.}
<C>__{nora}
<P>__{(reacting sharply)}
<D>__{i don't want to see you anymore.}
<A>__{she pulls away from bb and continues walking. bb walks behind her, getting soaked in the rain.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{i gotta talk to you.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i don't want to listen.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{give me a chance to explain. you owe me that much.}

<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i don't owe you anything.}
<A>__{bb lets her walk away. after a beat, he yells out.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{it was a lousy thing to do, okay? it was a lousy thing to use you to get back at your husband... but the fact is that i never would have met you otherwise.}
<A>__{nora stops and turns to look at bb.}
<C>__{bb}
<P>__{(more quietly)}
<D>__{it was lousy... it was a disgusting, terrible thing... but a lot of good came out of it.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{what kind of a person would come up with such a devious thing?}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{i'm not always a nice guy, i admit that. i got a lot of training in deceit... it's an occupational hazard.}

<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i'd like to know what it is about me that i have to fall for tin men. what kind of character flaw do i have?}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{i didn't want to have to come here. i wish that i didn't have to ever see you again. i've gone this far in my life without having to have this kind of thing happen to me. i was going through life, sailing along, pretty good... doing okay, and i tried to get even with some crazy guy... and i'm here.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{the wet becomes you. gets rid of some of the slickness.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{i don't like the idea that i'm not in control of this, but if this stuff's got to happen, i guess i've got no choice. i wanna... ya know...}
<P>__{(he gets angry)}
<D>__{... i wanna be with ya! okay, i said that... i said it, okay?! i wanna be with ya! it pisses the hell out of me, and i'm gonna tell you that to your face, but i want to be with you because... i miss you and i'd like to live with you... i'd like to marry you... and that's that!}
<A>__{nora eyes him carefully. the rain falls on her umbrella and the rain beats on bb's head. after a long moment.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i was hoping for something a little more romantic... but, okay.}
<A>__{a slight smile comes to bb's face.}
