<D>__{damn it! i got him back, didn't i?}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{yes, yes you did. that was good of you. (beat) i'm surprised karla didn't shoot him. or do you think he held back out of delicacy towards you?}

<D>__{to warn you. because he knew, deep down, it was you all along.}
<C>__{bill haydon}
<D>__{so did you.}
<A>__{haydon stares out, lost in thought.}
<C>__{bill haydon }
<D>__{i had to pick a side george. it was an aesthetic choice as much as a moral one. the west has grown so very ugly, don't you think?}
<A>__{smiley doesn't answer. a moment of silence.}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{did karla ever consider having you take over the circus?}

<A>__{for a moment haydon looks genuinely puzzled.}
<C>__{bill haydon}
<D>__{oh, that was nothing personal, george, i hope you understand that? karla said you were good, the one we had to worry about. but you do have a blind spot.}
<C>__{bill haydon }
<D>__{he reckoned if i was known to be ann's lover you wouldn't be able to see me straight. and he was right, up to a pointerior}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{up to a pointerior}
