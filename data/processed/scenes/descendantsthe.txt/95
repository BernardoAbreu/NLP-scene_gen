<L>__{interior hotel suite bedroom night}
<A>__{matt tosses and turns, gets up and goes to the bathroom. moments later exiting the bathroom, he decides he should make a routine inspection and wanders into }
<L>__{interior hotel suite sitting room continuous}
<A>__{ where he eyes a lump on the fold out bed. he creeps up when sid awakens.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{hey, what's up?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{checking on me or something?}
<A>__{a sheepish look on his face, matt takes a seat on the edge of the bed.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i don't, uh... i haven't been sleeping very much lately.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{understandable.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i'm worried about my daughters. i'm worried there's something wrong with them.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{i used to do some messed up shit when i was a kid. still do. it's going to get worse after your wife dies.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what does alex really think about this stuff that's going on? what does she say?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{she doesn't.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what do you mean? i thought she talks to you all the time.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{we don't really talk about our like "issues." we just, i don't know, we deal with our shit by talking about other stuff and having a good time.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what would you do if you were me? how would you handle my daughters? how would you handle... the situation of this guy we're trying to find?}
<A>__{matt can't believe what he just asked, but he's desperate for clues from even the unlikeliest source.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{i told you what i'd do i'd lay his nuts on a dresser and hit `em with a spiked bat. with the daughters, i don't know. i'd take them on a trip. or no, i'd buy `em a bunch of shit. like with all the money you're going to get when you sell the land you're going to make stupid money, right? dude, you could buy them anything.}
<A>__{matt questions his sanity at having asked sid any advice.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{do you want some of it? some money?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{if i gave you a lot of money right now, tonight, would you leave?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{why would i leave?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{no, sid, i'm asking you a favor. if i give you money, will you leave?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{oh. i get it. is that what you want? you want me to go?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i guess not.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{look, dude, you're right. if i had daughters, i wouldn't know what to do. exchange them for sons, i guess.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{then i might wind up with something like you.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{i'm not so bad. i'm smart.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you're about a hundred miles away from smartville. no offense.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{you're mistaken, counselor. i'm smart. i have good hygiene. i'm an decent guitarist, a good cook. i cook food all the time. i'm vice president of the punahou chess club. and i always have weed.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i'm sure your parents are proud.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{it's possible. my mom's sort of busy right now.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what does she do, your mom?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{she's a receptionist at a pet clinic. but mostly she's been getting the house together after my dad died. my dad died a few months ago.}
<A>__{at first refusing to fall for it, matt sees this is no prank.}
<C>__{sid }
<D>__{november 24th. drunk driver. actually both drivers were drunk. yeah.}
<A>__{sid smiles and nods as though to make matt feel better about the sad news he just shared.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{goodnight, sid. i will see you tomorrow.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{goodnight, boss.}
