<L>__{exterior griffith park carousel day}
<A>__{disjointed calliope music as the wheel of fate and fortune goes around until we pull back to reveal: jon archer (30) rising winged pegasus. on the adjacent unicorn is his son matthew (5). clutching a balloon, matty waves at his dad. a happy moment, like so many certain to follow until we realize we are watching them through... sniper's rifle scope sniper's eyes wait until the child clears his aim archer is the target. they round the bend and disappear...}

<A>__{loses his grip on the unicorn. archer reaches over and pulls him into his lap. they happily ride together... as the horses sweep back into view... exposing archer... now we see the sniper. castor troy is cool, efficient, aggressive, sexual. his finger closes around the trigger. boom! a bullet rips into archer's back. bleeding... he drops off his horse... and sinks to the deck of the carousel. his eyes desperately searching... searching... searching... until he sees matthew lies on his back still. slowly, archer reaches out and takes matthew's hand... and now we see color for the first time... blood red... as bleeding father touches bleeding son... tilt up to the winged pegasus flying by now in full color and up up up to matthew's red balloon... floating away. handel's messiah over a series of shots:}

<A>__{sweeps by, as if marking time itself...}
<B>__{holy place}
<A>__{smoky, spiritual... dominated by a gleaming, golden cross. a priest kneels before it deep in prayer. the glimmering cross comes into focus... but it's just a light reflection... off the casing of a large bomb. this is no chapel... but an atrium. somewhere. and as the "priest" rubs out his cigarette we see it's castor troy carefully installing this complex device.}

<A>__{a silence descends on the chastised team. as they go back to work, veteran agent tito biondi takes archer aside.}
