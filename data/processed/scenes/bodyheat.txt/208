<A>__{grace sits on the other side of the glass from racine. they talk on telephones. grace's eyes are sad; they say he thinks racine is going crazy.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{but what if that was someone else's body in there? what if it was already there when i got there dead and waiting for me. maybe her friend... mary ann.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{her teeth were left, man. we sent them back to illinois. the identification was positive. that was her, that was matty tyler walker. that was her and she's dead.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{you're not listening to me. what if she's been using this other girl's name? since she met walker three years ago, since she first spotted him and decided to take him... one way or another. maybe walker or any of us never knew her real name.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{why would she want to hide her identity?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe there was something in her past, something so bad she was afraid it would queer it with walker if he found out that he'd never marry her.}
<A>__{grace is unreceptive to this. but racine is charged.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{let's say she's living as the other girl, this girl from her past. someone whose history she knew and could use any way she wanted. and there's only one person in the world who knows the truth. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{racine }
<P>__{(he leans in)}
<D>__{and then just when matty's got me on the line, when she's finally going to collect, that one person shows up. that girl. finds her. and threatens to expose her. so matty starts paying her off. maybe she even promises to cut her in on edmunds' money. now she's got to share it with two people.}
<A>__{racine peaks, tapping the glass between them as though it were all there for grace to see.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{but when matty sees a way to get rid of both of them at once. a way to solve all her problems and get clear, with no one looking for her. at the boathouse. you find two bodies, me and this girl. two killers dead. case closed.}
<A>__{oscar isn't buying.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{you can't find the money, can you, oscar? doesn't that tell you something?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it tells me she moved it and we can't find it. and that don't mean shit. it could be sittin' in any bank in the world waiting for a dead lady to come for it.}
<A>__{racine, calmer now, shakes his head "no."}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{do you hear what you're saying? it's crazy. this matty would've had to been one quick, smart broad.}
<A>__{racine confirms grace's fears with a look that can only be called half crazed. there's the glimmer of a rueful smile.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{oscar, don't you understand? that was her special gift she was relentless.}
<P>__{(much quieter)}
<D>__{matty was the kind of person who could do what was necessary. whatever was necessary. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<A>__{these words have no special import to grace. he looks at racine without hope.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{racine, you got to face something. you killed edmund walker, man. and you're going down for it. two people are dead. and no matter how you want to figure it, you ain't bringin' either of 'em back to life.}
<A>__{grace gives him a long look, then hangs up the phone. he stands up and walks away. racine sits and stares.}
