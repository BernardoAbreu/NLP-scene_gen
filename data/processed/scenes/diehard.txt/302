<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{the vault room}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{let's move.}
<A>__{the last of the money is piled on. hans hangs onto holly while eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags. kristoff goes to the door to scope their escape...suddenly he is cold cocked by a rifle butt.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{mcclane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still tumbling down from the roof above. he holds the machine gun ready.}
<C>__{mcclane}
<D>__{hans!}
<A>__{hans turns, not that surprised. grinning, he yanks holly into view. no words need be said.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{john!}
<C>__{mcclane}
<D>__{holly, we have to stop meeting like this.}
<P>__{(taking in the vault)}
<D>__{so that's what it was. a fucking robbery.}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{so why nuke the building, hans?}
<C>__{hans}
<P>__{(with a shrug)}
<D>__{when you steal six hundred dollars, you can disappear...but when you steal six hundred million, they will find you...unless you play dead.}
<P>__{(tight smile)}
<D>__{which happens to be your next role... drop your gun, please.}
<A>__{mcclane hesitates...hans pushes the gun against holly again, really hurting her. eddie quickly raises his weapon.}
<C>__{hans}
<P>__{(to eddie)}
<D>__{nein, dies ein ist mein.}
<P>__{(to mcclane)}
<D>__{this time john wayne does not walk off into the sunset with grace kelly.}
<C>__{mcclane}
<D>__{that was gary cooper, shithead...}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{no more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!}
<C>__{mcclane}
<P>__{(slowly putting down his gun)}
<D>__{whoa, hans, now you're the cowboy?}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{'yippe ki yea, mother fucker'? now you are fucked.}
<A>__{he aims:}
<C>__{mcclane}
<D>__{holly, now...!}
<A>__{instantly, holly sidesteps, jabs her elbow into hans' face! mcclane over shoulder shot at the same moment holly moves, mcclane grabs his baretta from its hiding place taped to the back of his neck, shoots hans high in the chest! the bullet passes right through hans, and the window behind him splatters with blood and shatters. even while this is happening, mcclane spins: eddie through mcclane's widespread legs eddie takes a gunshot, drops just like on gunsmoke.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood in shock.}
<B>__{mcclane}
<C>__{mcclane}
<D>__{you were right about us americans.}
<P>__{(he blows smoke}
<D>__{from his pistol}
<P>__{barrel)}
<D>__{we are cowboys.}
<A>__{vault room wider incredibly, hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and disbelief. he reels, falls against the windowsill, starts to topple and then he grits his teeth and from some inward place finds a last reserve of strength and he grabs: holly's wrist and she is yanked off her feet!}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{hans goes out the window, pulling holly with him! mcclane leaps forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the last minute!}
