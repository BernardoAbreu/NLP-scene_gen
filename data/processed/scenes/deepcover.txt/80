<A>__{barbosa, gopher with hernandez, taft's partner. now we know hernandez is corrupt: that's how they knew eddie was talking.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{i got nothing to give you, my man. i'm an il liquid son of a bitch.}
<C>__{hernandez}
<D>__{felix, i keep telling them, "i have informants down there, i'm working guys, i can't say who..." if you don't have money, give me busts, or they're gonna start wondering about me.}
<C>__{gopher}

<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{you can have gopher.}
<C>__{gopher}
<D>__{oh gawd...}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{how about a lawyer?}
<C>__{gopher}
<P>__{(knows who he means)}
<D>__{felix, don't do this.}
<C>__{hernandez}
<P>__{(he knows, too)}
<D>__{great, lawyers are great, jewish is best. but i need spades, too. the politicians want dark facts to scare the suburbs so they'll vote republican.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{lawyers and spades; i got the trifecta: two dealers and a girl who does their wash. two niggers and a kike; all democrats.}

<D>__{don't do this, felix. it'll go wrong. kill elias if you have to, honey, but don't set him up for this. it damages your prestige.}
<A>__{barbosa faces his cocaine. he tries to resist the pull, then yields. he does another line. it's his friend. he loves it. he picks up a cellular phone, dials.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{david, you're awake, i'm impressed... i'm sorry about what happened... listen, i will get you twenty boxes, like you wanted. you were right, you should have what you need... tomorrow night... bring your partner and that girl with the store, betty... i need her advice on something. i want us to have fun, like we used to. we'll go to that shrimp place, okay?... good... me, too, david.}
