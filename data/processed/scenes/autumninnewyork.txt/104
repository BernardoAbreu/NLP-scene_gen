<L>__{interior wills' bedroom night}
<A>__{charlotte and wills are little more than silhouettes, lying entwined in the rich darkness, conversing in whispers:}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i wish i were exaggerating, but i'm not. i slept with every one of them. really. look through dolly's old photo albums... or any movie magazine... visit aspen at christmas. i was on a mission. and until recently i really didn't think i had a problem. or if i did, it was definitely the most pleasurable one i could imagine.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{what changed?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{my house in malibu burned to the ground.}
<A>__{charlotte laughs. wills smiles with sad irony.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i know, it sounds funny. but it must have triggered something because the next thing i knew i couldn't sleep. i'd lie awake at night absolutely terrified. like a kid left alone in the dark.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{what were you scared of?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{how quickly time was passing and how adolescent i still felt. how meaningless all my choices seemed. how lonely i was. so i liquidated my portfolio, sold my businesses, and moved back here. to start over, settle down, start acting my age.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you were supposed to be my one last dalliance with youth.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{well, for your sake, i hope i am.}
<A>__{he thinks for a moment, then smiles, and kisses her brow.}
