<L>__{exterior rodeo drive day}
<A>__{vivian comes out onto the street and stands, lost. she takes a deep breath, trying to control herself. two women, in elegant designer outfits, stroll by, eyeing vivian as if she were a freak. vivian suddenly feels naked. she turns and hurries away.}
<L>__{interior hotel lobby day}
<A>__{vivian enters the lobby, upset, nervous and paranoid. she feels an emptiness in her stomach at the sight of all the luxury around her. she hurries toward the elevators. at the front desk, mr. thomas, once again spots her. he crosses the lobby and deftly cuts her off from the elevator.}

<D>__{may i help you miss?}
