<L>__{interior lingerie shop day}
<A>__{marian and raquel, two exquisite young women, are looking over the merchandise.}
<C>__{raquel}
<D>__{did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{how could i miss it? the tv won't quit with that stuff.}
<C>__{raquel}
<D>__{they're gonna cook him.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{andy's from utah. he says there you have a choice... you can die by hanging or by firing squad.}
<C>__{raquel}
<D>__{which would you choose?}
<A>__{marian holds up a black teddy to her body.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{andy would go for this, don't you think?... firing squad, definitely.}
<C>__{raquel}
<D>__{do they aim for the head or for the heart?}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{the heart, i guess.}
<C>__{raquel}
<D>__{i wouldn't... the brain would know what's going on. your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. savage pain, marian.}
<A>__{raquel takes a red teddy and holds it up to her chest.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{oh, that's hot... so you'd rather be hung, huh?}
<A>__{they both giggle at the obvious joke.}
<C>__{raquel}
<D>__{absolutely... soon as your neck snaps, you black out. it might take a while for the body to die, but you wouldn't feel it.}
<A>__{marian reaches for a pair of panties with a hole in the crotch.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{you might be right, raquel.}
<A>__{marian sticks a finger through the hole in the panties and wiggles it. the girls giggle. raquel sees andy walking into the store. he is sneaking up behind marian, and motions with a finger to his lips to raquel not to say anything. when andy gets directly behind marian, he puts his hands over her eyes.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{guess who?}
