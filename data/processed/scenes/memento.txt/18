<D>__{you don't know?}
<C>__{leonard}

<C>__{burt}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{you said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. don't you remember?}
<C>__{leonard}

<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{like waking. like you always just woke up.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{that must suck. all... backwards.}
<A>__{leonard raises his eyebrows in enquiry.}
<C>__{burt }
<D>__{well, like.. you gotta pretty good idea of what you're gonna do next, but no idea what you just did.}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{i'm the exact opposite.}
<C>__{leonard}
<P>__{(focuses on burt)}

<C>__{burt}
<D>__{seen you together, that's all.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{he's not my friend, burt. but if he calls, or if he turns up here, then you give me a call in my room, okay?}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{sure. but nobody else, right?}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{just this guy.}
<A>__{leonard indicates the polaroid of teddy.}
<C>__{leonard }
<D>__{i hope my condition won't be a problem for you.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{not if you remember to pay your bill.}
<A>__{leonard smiles and reaches into his wallet. e.c.u. of fingers rifling bills in a wallet. leonard counts out some money and hands it to burt. burt takes the money, spotting something over leonard's shoulder.}
