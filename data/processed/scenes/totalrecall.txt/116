<A>__{quail, melina and bennie make their way through the crowds to bennie's depot. the streets are even busier then before people are now beginning to evacuate the city. everyone is carrying their possessions bundles, suitcases, pets, etc., etc. the loudspeaker vans are still touring and broad casting the same message. bennie indicates a building on their left.}
<L>__{interior car pool early morning}
<A>__{bennie and melina follow quail as he walks up and down the rows of vehicles in the vast building. there are bull dozers and ore haulers as well as solar taxis.}

<D>__{we'll never get near the sphinx! they'll blow us apart!}
<A>__{quail ignores him as he continues to mumble to himself. he rapidly but carefully inspects each vehicle as they pass. camera tracks rapidly with them.}

<D>__{what are we doing, charles? for god's sake, tell us.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{the sphinx... it's not some useless artifact, it's a machine built by some alien race eighteen millions years ago. the same race that built the on one earth... for the same purpose.}
<A>__{he stops in front of a large, odd shaped vehicle with a large scoop or propeller on the front.}
