<L>__{interior bathroom night}
<A>__{some hours later, it's dark outside. john still tied to the bidet. the door opens a crack and somebody slips inside. we hear the toilet seat go down. as his eyes adjust he can dimly see nadia sitting on the toilet. she doesn't look at him. as she finishes she finally turns and holds his eye. she stands and slips out the door, leaving him alone.}
<L>__{exterior dual carriageway night}
<A>__{cars crawl by on the road outside, their tail lights stretching over the hill. the shot processes and fades into dawn and light. the early morning commuters now use the carriageway.}
