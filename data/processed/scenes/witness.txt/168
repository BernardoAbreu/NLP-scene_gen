<L>__{interior barn day}
<A>__{mcelroy at the top of the ladder, looking down. then easing over, placing his feet on the rungs.}
<B>__{book}
<A>__{he stands below in a cowpen, using the cows for cover. the cows stare balefully at him. a large goat nuzzles him, hooks at him with its horns. book waits, watches.}
<B>__{his pov mcelroy}
<A>__{visible to his knees as he eases down the ladder. he stops at every rung to scrape his shoes free of the cowshit covering the rungs.}
<B>__{back to book}
<A>__{he turns now to a door at the back of the pen. he un hooks it, pulls it open, moves inside.}
<B>__{another angle book}
<A>__{he is now in a small passageway giving on to the entrance to a nearly empty silo. above the entrance, a ladder (interior) rises to the top of the structure. book looks in, and up. we should get the impression that book's been here before, expects what he sees.}
<B>__{what he sees}
<A>__{forty feet up, a patch of blue sky through an open hatch.}
<B>__{back to book}
<A>__{he steps through to the base of the ladder, then ducks beyond it into the silo. there is about two feet of old silage covering the floor. he turns, looks up the white walls.}
<B>__{his pov inside silo}
<A>__{an inside ladder runs to the top.}
<B>__{his pov kickboard}
<A>__{standing against the wall next to the entrance... . obviously to be inserted as the silo is filled.}
<B>__{book}
<A>__{now, quickly, he ducks back out through the entrance, crosses to the door to the cowpen, very cautiously peers out..}
<B>__{what he sees}
<A>__{mcelroy at the bottom of the ladder, looking in the other direction (toward the milkhouse).}
<B>__{back to book}
<A>__{very carefully he shoves the cowpen door (which opens outward into the cowpen). it begins to swing very slowly open. book immediately turns, darts back into the silo.}
<B>__{mcelroy}
<A>__{turning slowly toward the cowpen... then fires twice as his eye catches the motion of the swinging door. his shots blow half a row of eli's precious tools off an adjacent wall. mcelroy reloads, starts across toward the door.}
