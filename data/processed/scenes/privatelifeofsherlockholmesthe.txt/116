<L>__{exterior baker street day}
<A>__{there is snow on the ground, and drifts of it piled up along the curbs. traffic is light. householders are shovelling the snow off the sidewalks, and pedestrians are hurrying along bundled up against the cold.}
<L>__{interior living room 221b baker street day}
<A>__{holmes, in his dressing gown, and watson, in his smoking jacket, are at the breakfast table. there is snow on the window sills, and a cozy fire is burning in the grate. watson is reading the morning paper. holmes is sorting through his mail.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(holding up envelope)}
<D>__{h'mmm. a letter from the diogenes club.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{maybe mycroft is putting you up for membership.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{if only to have the distinct pleasure of blackballing his brother.}
<A>__{he has slit open the envelope. watson watches him curiously as he reads the letter, but holmes' face remains expressionless. slowly he puts down the letter, rises, crosses to the window, stands there staring out into the wintry street.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{aren't you going to finish your breakfast?}
<A>__{holmes doesn't answer. watson takes a lump of sugar out of the bowl with a pair of tongs, drops it into his coffee. then glancing over his shoulder to make sure holmes isn't watching, he swivels the letter around with the tongs. it is written on diogenes club stationery, and reads:}
<D>__{9th december, 1888 dear sherlock, my sources in tokyo inform me that ilse von hoffmanstal was arrested last week by the japanese counter intelligence service for spying on naval installations in yokohama harbour. after a secret trial, she was summarily executed by a firing squad. it might interest you to know that}
<A>__{the page ends at this pointerior watson turns the sheet of paper over with the tongs. the letter continues on the other side.}
<D>__{she had been living in japan these past few months under the name of mrs. ashdown. sincerely, mycroft}
<A>__{watson looks toward holmes, who is still standing with his back to the room, gets up from the table.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{holmes i'm terribly sorry about this.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(quietly, without turning)}
<D>__{where is it, watson?}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{in the files. may to july, 1885.}
<A>__{holmes turns to the bookshelves above the desk. from a row of similar volumes, he slides out the three files marked may, june, and july 1885. actually, it's the medical bag, standing on end, with the spines of three volumes pasted on the bottom.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you're getting better.}
<A>__{he sets the bag down on the desk, opens it, takes out a bottle of cocaine. watson watches him with compassion as he crosses to his bedroom with his cocaine, goes in, shuts the door. footsteps are heard hurrying up the stairs, and after a moment there is a knock on the door. watson approaches the door, opens it to reveal inspector lestrade a short, nervous man whose features are sharper than his mind. he is wearing an overcoat, his bowler is in his hands, and his fingers are drumming on the crown.}
<C>__{lestrade}
<D>__{good morning, watson.}
<P>__{(stepping in)}
<D>__{just happened to be in the neighborhood, and i thought }
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{what is it this time, inspector lestrade?}
<C>__{lestrade}
<D>__{we've had three rather nasty murders in whitechapel. all ladies of easy virtue. you may read something about it the newspapers are referring to the killer as jack the ripper.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{yes, i think i have.}
<C>__{lestrade}
<D>__{some of us at scotland yard were wondering if perhaps mr. holmes would be willing to }
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(a glance toward the bedroom)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, lestrade. but at the moment, holmes is working on another problem.}
<C>__{lestrade}
<P>__{(trying to hide his disappointment)}
<D>__{oh... well, i just thought it was the kind of case that might interest him. i dare say we can solve it without his help.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{oh, i'm sure you will.}
<A>__{from holmes' bedroom comes the sound of a melancholy tune being played on the violin. watson starts to ease lestrade out of the door.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{good day, lestrade.}
<A>__{he shuts the door after him, listens to the sound of the violin for a moment. then he crosses to the wicker chair, seats himself. he takes some sheets of paper out of the rack and places them on the writing arm, dips his pen in the inkwell, starts to write. the violin music continues over scene, infinitely romantic, infinitely sad.}
