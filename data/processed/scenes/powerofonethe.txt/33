<L>__{interior long hallway closeup pk and morrie}
<A>__{as they walk down the long hall looking straight ahead. sweat dapples pk's face. both boys are focused on double doors at the end of the hall. there is the distant muffled sound of a crowd cheering.}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{you hear sutcliffe screwed bartlett's sister when he stayed with them over holidays?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{i don't believe it.}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{i heard it from bartlett's own lips. he's selling reservations for next holiday. a pound for one night; three pounds for four.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{you register?}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{for both of us. took the whole holiday.}
<A>__{the cheering crowd grows louder the closer they get to the double doors.}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{you nervous?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{christ! i'm about to have a calf. this bloody boer gets lucky, we're in the poorhouse.}
<A>__{they reach the double doors. still in closeup, morrie turns to face pk for the first time.}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{now remember. we're not here to exhibit our wares. we go in, we do the job, we get out. right?}
<A>__{pk is so focused his eyes seem to bore through the doors. he does not move his head a hair.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{morrie and pk draw a deep breath. together they push open the double doors. together they stride into a floodlit, fully packed sports arena and head down the fan lined aisle to the raised boxing ring in the center. schoolboys in their respective school blazers, afrikaan and english, yell, whistle and clap. pk and morrie, in full frame, reveal pk in a boxing robe with taped hands, and morrie with towel and bucket.}
<C>__{announcer}
<D>__{and at the end of six matches in all weight divisions, the score is prince of wales three victories, helpmakeer three victories.}
<A>__{the stands explode with cheers.}
<C>__{announcer}
<D>__{and now for the final bout to determine which school will win the johannesburg 1950 public school boxing team championship. in this corner, weighing 140 pounds, standing 5'8", from the helpmakeer school with a record of 13 0 on the year, jannie geildenhaus.}
<A>__{a huge cheer goes up for jannie, muscular, bare chested, as he dances and shadowboxes for the crowd. pk enters the ring. he stands, robe on, eyes intent on jannie. when the noise subsides the announcer continues.}
<C>__{announcer}
<D>__{and in this corner, representing the prince of wales school, the current johannesburg public school welterweight champion, also with a record of 13 0 on the year, also 140 pounds, kid p.k.}
<A>__{now the english schoolboys cheer for their man, but pk does not respond. he barely moves. he raises an arm in bare acknowledgment. his attention stays focused across the ring on his shadowboxing opponent. pk watches jannie dance closely when a low chanting begins from outside the stadium african, tribal, mystical harmonies of black voices building until the white voices inside the stadium are stunned to silence. the song carries beautifully in the night. for the first time pk's focus is broken, but not like the others in the audience, who haven't a clue as to what's happening. he has heard this before. this is familiar. this is for him. a distant knowing flickers in his eyes like a man who has heard the voice of fate whisper his name. over and over, one phrase is indistinguishable the chorus of the song. "ono bi shobi ingelosi." the chanting stops as suddenly as it began. a moment passes before the crowd begins to buzz with the phenomenon. the announcer attempts to bring everyone's attention back to the business at hand.}
<C>__{announcer}
<D>__{we thank the native population for their spirited display of enthusiasm. but now, on to the main event. fighters to center ring, please.}
<A>__{pk, focused again, meets jannie at the referee.}
<C>__{referee}
<D>__{you both know the rules. no butts, no elbows, no low blows. first man to score three knock downs wins. let's have a good clean fight. good luck to you.}
<A>__{the fighters slap leather. pk turns back to his corner when his focus is broken dramatically by a face in the crowd. his pov front row half dozen schoolgirls sit; one of them maria elizabete marais, 17, with honey blonde hair and lapis blue eyes, turns her head and engages pk's eyes and his heart. she quickly looks away. but a connection has been made fire passed.}
<B>__{pk}
<A>__{goes back to his corner and takes off his robe. morrie stands, holding pk's mouthpiece.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{first row, third from the left. find out who she is.}
<A>__{morrie looks down at maria.}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{we're in a bloody war here, in case you forgot. let's keep our mind on that, hey?}
<A>__{he jams the mouthpiece into pk's mouth as the bell rings. pk turns to an onslaught by jannie, a real brawler. jannie's big, overhand rights almost nail pk until he finds his footing and dances away. jannie comes after him hard, his schoolmates bellowing encouragement. but pk's far superior boxing skills put jannie at an immed iate disadvantage. it is a classic battle of a boxer versus a fighter. pk's jabs keep jannie at an arm's length, until he closes with a combination. jannie, willing to take three punches to land one, absorbs pk's point scoring combinations and tries to land knockout punches. when he has had enough punishment he lunges into a clinch.}
<C>__{jannie}
<D>__{blery rooinek. i will kill you.}
<A>__{pk pushes off as jannie hammers at his kidneys. backing up, pk repays the compliment with two quick jabs to the face. pk works jannie, turning him left then right, working the angles, keeping him off balance while he racks up the points. jannie goes left. as pk chases him that way his eyes fix on something out of the ring. his pov rear exit door tall black man with a younger black companion of more average height, the only black faces in a crowd of 2,000 people.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{their presence distracts pk for a split second, and in that split second jannie seizes the opportunity. he comes across with a big right hand to pk's jaw. jannie connects. pk goes down hard. the crowd goes wild. morrie leaps up and down in the corner.}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{get up! get up!}
<A>__{but pk is seeing double. he shakes his head, trying to clear it.}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{up! up!}
<A>__{pk's pov jannie dancing in his corner, sensing victory, the ref over him, counting.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{pk forces himself up. the ref checks him.}
<C>__{referee}
<D>__{okay. fight.}
<A>__{jannie comes rushing in, banging pk with a series of hard rights, but dropping his left each time he throws one. pk absorbs the punishment as best he can, backing up, dancing away. jannie is all over him just as the bell rings. jannie goes back to his corner, triumphant. pk goes back to his and sits down with a blank ex pression. morrie goes to work on a small cut over his eye.}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{what are you trying to do, bankrupt us? what happened?}
<A>__{pk turns and looks at the two africans at the rear door. morrie's eyes follow him, tensing as he sees the two men.}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{christ! if they get caught in here they're dead.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what the hell's going on?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{well, worry about it later. in case you haven't noticed, this boer bastard is trying to kill you.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{you see the way he drops his left when he throws the right?}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{yeah?}
<A>__{the bell rings. pk and morrie trade a look. jannie comes rushing over and throws a big right. pk steps to his own right side and pops jannie right over his dropped left hand. he looks at morrie again.}
<B>__{angle on morrie}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{thank you, god.}
<A>__{jannie comes after pk, paying for each big right he throws as pk finds his mark. pk plants one, then two, then three punches on jannie's face. finally, frus trated, jannie forsakes all pretense of boxing and tries to nail pk with wild, flailing blows. pk bobs and weaves and feints. jannie's punches grow weary. pk begins to bear down, driving his man back with rapid fire com binations until he delivers the coup de grace, a left hook to the heart and a driving right uppercut. jannie goes down in a heap. the crowd goes wild. the referee counts him out. jannie's seconds rush into the ring to lift their fallen fighter. morrie also rushes in, followed by the prince of wales boxing team. they hoist pk up on their shoulders. pk's pov maria marais rising from her seat, and leaving with the other girls. their eyes meet. her hint of a smile breaks his heart. she disappears in the crowd.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{pk's eyes rise to the rear exit. the tall african and his companion have vanished.}
