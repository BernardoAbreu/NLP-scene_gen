<A>__{she comes out this time purse in hand and sighs at starks.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{[as if she owes him an explanation] i forgot my purse.}
<A>__{starks nods slowly. the waitress gets in her car and looks again at starks in her rearview mirror. he has hardly any winter gear on him no gloves, no hat, no coat just jeans and a flannel. he looks lost among his surroundings, as much because he doesn't know where he is as because he doesn't look like he belongs there. she reverses towards him.}
