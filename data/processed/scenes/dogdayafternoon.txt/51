<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{what kind of things, leon?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{ten days i spent in atlantic city sonny was frantic he knew i was drinking; he didn't know where i was... who i was with. i couldn't explain why i did the things i did. so i went to this psychiatrist who explained to me i was a woman in a man's body. so sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that? 2500 dollars! my god, he's in hock up to his ears already.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{he needed money? for the operation for you?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{it made him crazy so much demand, he'd fly into this rages. and i got more depressed than ever; i saw i'd never get the operation. so i tried to take my life i swallowed about a half pound of pills... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers... you name it. but i just threw them up and wound up in the hospital. sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'wow!' so when i hear he's in the bank, i almost go crazy because i know he's doin' it for me.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i can't talk to him.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{you're in it up to your ass, leon. you're an accessory. you talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i'm afraid.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{how is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i don't know what to say to him. i can't.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{you think it over, leon.}
<A>__{moretti walks over to the wall phone, picks up the receiver, and waits to be connected with the bank and sonny.}
