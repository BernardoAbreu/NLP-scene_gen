<L>__{interior museum morning}
<A>__{a perfect rainbow is trapped inside the two flawless mother daughter diamonds, glinting in the morning sun. marie can barely contain her excitement as she paces frantically in the dark marble museum hall, reaching out a trembling hand towards the glass case containing the priceless jewels...}

<D>__{you really think you're ready for your inheritance?}
<A>__{marie looks round to see jay striding into the museum, still in the same clothes as yesterday...}

<A>__{jay looks at her sternly.}
<C>__{jay}

<C>__{marie}
<D>__{i'm...responsible...}
<A>__{jay shakes his head slowly, deliberately.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{really? underage drinking, prying into my personal affairs, fighting...}
