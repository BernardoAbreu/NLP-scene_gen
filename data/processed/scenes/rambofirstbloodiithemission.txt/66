<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior rain forest barnyard}
<A>__{brewer is face to face with a mangy pig, which grunts its annoyance. he is stuck up to his knees in the mud of a small fenced yard containing a few pigs and chickens. the yard is adjacent to a large thatch hut, and four or five additional hootches are visible farther downslope, nestled among the trees. brewer holds a finger to his lips, cautioning the pig to silence. he lays backward in the black slop as a vietnamese man in peasant pajamas comes to the door of the nearest hootch, an island of light in the dark forest. smoking a cigarette he looks around, perhaps scanning for the source of the faint crashing he heard a moment before. following a dirt road, little more than a trail between the hootches, an old woman approaches. she is barefoot, and pushes a rusting bicycle laden with an enormous bundle of firewood. brewer struggles to free himself, straining in silence as the pigs step disdainfully around him. the man flicks away the cigarette. he laughs raucously at something the old woman says and hurries to help her carry the firewood inside. brewer looks up, at his chute billowing quietly in the branches overhead. the old woman pauses at the door, spits a shot of betelnut juice into the yard, and goes inside. the door bangs shut.}
<B>__{tight on brewer}
<A>__{sighing with relief. suddenly a dark object shoots into frame, seizing him. brewer's head snaps around. the object is rambo's hand, painted camo green. rambo drags him with a sucking pop from the mud. the team leader glares.}
<C>__{rambo}
<P>__{(a freezing whisper)}
<D>__{that's one.}
<A>__{brewer pauses a moment, assimilating the implicit warning. then reaches for his harness buckles to free himself.}
