<L>__{exterior chris' position day}
<A>__{it's quiet, weird. chris takes his pants down, squats. he thinks he hears something, tenses. there is a soft rustling sound now. and as he focuses on it he realizes it is coming from very close to him. something light and sinuous moving over the leaves. he looks down. a bright yellow and orange ringed krait viper is crawling right between his two legs. it stops, senses another life standing over it. chris frozen with dread. the snake crawls on, pulling its long, long 15 foot body behind it. on chris, eyes dilated, slowly regaining his breath looking around everywhere now.}
