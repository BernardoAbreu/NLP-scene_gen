<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior dante's inferno later}
<A>__{at the front of the inferno, difford and two slip stream helpers are unpacking cardboard boxes. the kids have clustered around them, momentarily forgetting the arcade machine. difford pulls cut a handful of game cartridges as well as goggles which dangle over his arm.}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{here's what we're going to do. what i'm holding are the home versions of arcade, the prototypes...}
<A>__{this is met with an enthusiastic response from the kids.}
<C>__{difford}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{in a month or so we're planning on releasing arcade in both versions, but we're still fine tuning, and that's where you guys luck out. so what we'll do is have you register with us, and then we're going to loan these out to you for a week or so. the only thing you have to do in return is answer some marketing questions. sound fair?}
<A>__{the kids can't line up fast enough.}
<B>__{our group}
<A>__{is right up front, with nick and alex being the first two in line. difford winks at nick.}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{so what do you think?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{sign me up.}
<A>__{alex is glancing around now. she sees benz, stilts, and laurie, but not greg.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{where's greg?}
<A>__{laurie jerks her thumb back at the arcade machine.}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{he's still working on the game.}
<A>__{and alex finds greg for a moment, spotting him over the heads of the other kids.}
<B>__{on greg}
<A>__{his face is a mirror of nick's...sweat pouring down, grinning from ear to ear. it's addictive as hell. sights and sounds rush past us on the three screens, racing at incredible speeds. and now, from within the game, we hear a strange sound...a scream of sorts, halfway between a shriek and a sonic boom.}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{time's up, friend.}
<A>__{the shriek sonic boom reaches a nightmarish pitch and suddenly the screens}
<B>__{explode with light. at the front of the inferno...}
<A>__{everyone turns in response. it's as if someone set off a flashbulb.}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{pushes her way back through the kids, making her way to the arcade machine.}
<B>__{arcade}
<A>__{greg is nowhere to be found. in fact, the cybergloves and goggles are dangling from the control board, abandoned. alex turns to a nearby kid.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{where's greg?}
<A>__{the kid shrugs.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{don't know. i think i saw him walk out, but i'm not sure...}
<A>__{alex isn't listening anymore. she's staring at the floor of the arcade machine. greg's polaroid is on the floor...the photo of greg and alex which he manipulated. alex picks it up, glancing around. she scans the faces of the crowd and she doesn't see greg anywhere. she turns away.}
<B>__{on screen}
<A>__{a video figure is lying on the computer generated ground. it sits up, brushing dust from itself, and looks around. it faces us. only the image isn't of nick anymore. it's video greg now. up front, alex has re joined her friends. the four of them are now clutching arcade home versions in their arms, cybergloves and all. they look like kids on christmas day.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{has anyone seen greg?}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{he's probably outside. you know how he is. gets bored...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yeah, outside.}
<A>__{nick heads for the door with the rest of the group in tow.}
