He pulls himself up, reaches inside the window, and whips the steering wheel hard right. The SEDAN fishtails into a parked Toyota.  Utah bounces forward, slamming into the asphalt.  Glass shards and crushed steel are strewn everywhere, as radiator steam whistles hot. Pig Nose #2, riding shotgun, is trapped.  Can't get his crushed door open.  The DRIVER pushes open her door. Gropes for her pistol.  Utah springs -- no respect for a lady.  He slams the door, pins her arm and slams again and again until the gun drops.  Utah kicks it away as the woman collapses in pain.

Reagan bodyslams a TEENAGER putting gas in his MUSTANG. He flips his big pistol to LBJ as the other Presidents charge past him.  Nixon jumps behind the wheel of the Mustang.  LBJ and JFK pile in. Reagan grabs the gas nozzle out of the car. He pulls out a ZIPPO LIGHTER. Reagan raises the gas nozzle like a gun and holds the zippo below and slightly in front of it.  He flicks the flame. Then pulls the trigger on the nozzle. Like an impromptu flame thrower, the nozzle spews A TWENTY FOOT JET OF FIRE which engulfs the T-Bird in an instant. Any physical evidence in the car is rapidly incinerated. Customers are running, screaming. Nixon has the Mustang fired up.}

Out of the black smoke, PAPPAS charges like an angry bull, his snubnose held high.  NIXON sees him and floors it. The Mustang smokes out of the gas station as Pappas' shots blow out the back window. Utah and Reagan roll away from the blaze.  Johnny's pants are burning.  He gets to his knees in time for Reagan's kick to take him square in the solar plexus.  He folds in half.  Drops to the cement. Reagan kicks him again and takes off running. The President is burning. His suit jacket is ablaze.  He shucks out of it as he runs. Gasping, Johnny rapidly slaps his jeans.  Puts himself out.

We hear sirens and shouting, which recede as the two pelt along the alley.  It gets quieter.  Just the machine-gun slap of the shoes on pavement, and the hard breathing of the two men, each in overdrive, going all out in long blurring strides. REAGAN looks back.  Sees the demon cop behind him, gaining. Utah has become an engine, a running machine... juggernaut mode. AHEAD OF THEM a BLACK AND WHITE swings into the alley.

Utah powers into the tight space behind him. Blurring along between stucco walls. They emerge into the front yard. A WOMAN watering her lawn is so surprised she yelps and falls down. Reagan and Utah both hurdle her. AHEAD, KIDS ON BIKES, racing along the sidewalk. Reagan dodges the first, Utah slams into the next two. He crashes, rolling, tangled up in bikes and squawking teenagers. He comes out of a pile-up somehow still in high gear. Reagan flashes across the sunlit street. Dodges in front of a GARBAGE TRUCK which locks up the brakes. It stops so fast, one of the guys falls off the back. The GUY is getting up as Utah whips around the back of the truck. Knocks him sprawling. Utah doesn't stop.  Doesn't look back. Like he doesn't see anything in the real world but the figure running ahead of him.  Like it's some kind of hyperkinetic video game. Everything is a blur.  Suburbia smeared into staccato impressions. The house across the street is blocked by fence on both sides. A MAN is picking up his mail. Reagan pounds past him.  Right through the front door of the house. Utah follows. Panting as he sprints down a dark hallway. A WOMAN with a basket of washing SCREAMS as Reagan blasts past her, knocking her flying. Utah leaps over her sprawled legs. Cats blur underfoot.  Utah crunches down on a tail.  A CAT EXPLOSION.  Screeching merges with the woman's shrill shouts as Utah slams the back screen door off its hinges. Across the back yard.  Fence.  Over it.  Running on. REAGAN looks back. Sees Utah still behind him like in a bad dream. He enters the next house.  Sliding glass door. Utah sees Reagan pull it closed.  Locking it. Without breaking stride Johnny grabs a potted plant off a patio wall. Heaves it ahead of him. The glass BURST INTO A WALL OF DIAMONDS. Utah blasts through a microsecond later. Topples the kitchen table.  Furniture and crockery crashing everywhere. He sprints down a hallway after Reagan.

Slipping and sliding on iceplant, they skid down a steep slope.  Reagan reaches bottom. A TEN FOOT RETAINING WALL, dropping off like a cliff to pavement below. Reagan falls, landing on his feet.
