<L>__{exterior suq jerusalem day}
<A>__{carlos races through the suq, past a group of arabs who begin heeding the call to prayer. they roll out prayer mats and begin acclaiming in arabic that there is only one god and mohammed is his prophet. carlos grabs one of the canvas awnings that shade the alleyways and this cafe. he rips it off, trying to make an obstacle course between him and his pursuers. he overturns trays of olives, sacks of sunflower seeds, anything he can get his hands on.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{carlos runs headlong into a copper serving platter that is hanging on display. he is disoriented, terrified, and then seemingly from out of nowhere, he is tackled, grabbed by the arabs and dragged to a dark alley between two stores. carlos is overcome and brought down to the ground. one of the arabs evidently has a deep dislike for carlos and though carlos is subdued, he kicks the shit out of him.}
