<A>__{...in darkness. light begins to spill on her from the right revealing her face, lost in thought. this is rachel singer pretty, painfully young looking. a surgical dressing covers half her face. as we pull back a little we see that two young men sit either side of her. they are stephan gold (thirties) thick set, capable, and david peretz (late twenties), dark haired and pale faced. the three faces in the darkness, each looking straight ahead something from a caravaggio painting. the roaring, which we realise is the sound of engines, gradually runs down into silence. the light from the bay door which is opening off screen begins to flood the scene with harsh daylight, revealing the inside of a cargo plane. stephan turns to look at the growing light. then he turns to rachel.}

<A>__{he stands. rachel turns to look at david but he is standing too, his face a mask. rachel gathers herself, then stands and turns to follow the other two, walking towards the light. as the three approach the opening and descend the ramp of the bay door, we hear a woman's voice:}
