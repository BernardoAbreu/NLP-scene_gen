<C>__{gin}
<D>__{how many tries do i get?}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{one, before i beat you senseless, dump you over the side, and donate your share to charity.}
<A>__{she brings the fork up. the crate sways slightly. she lines up her prongs against the pallet's receiving holes...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{you gotta work on that impatient streak.}
<A>__{...and slips them straight in. first try.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{how professional.}
<A>__{she lifts the crate, but the boat lurches, and she nearly loses it off the fork. but she doesn't. swings her load around now. heading for the open hatchway, the roiling sea racing by. picking up speed, slightly...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{uh. thing on the left is the brakes?}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{or the thing on the right.}
<A>__{by now she is really rolling toward the wide open spaces...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{mac, it's jammed!}
<A>__{he pounces off the platform, flying after the lift as it accelerates through the opening...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{jump, for god's sa...}
<A>__{...tipping at the hatchway lip, the crate sliding off the prongs, our forklift tumbling out the hatch to the sea, just as mac... ...snatches gin by her hair, pulling her free of the falling forklift, catching the rim of the hatchway with his free hand, gin screaming in fright and pain, blindly grabbing his arm to be... ...jerked back to safety. clutching mac, she watches the sea behind them. where the crate and the forklift disappeared.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you did activate the floaters.}
<A>__{her head whips around. aghast.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{activa...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i did say, 'finish up on the floaters'. surely, you heard me.}
<A>__{her life. flashes before her eyes. as behind the ship... ...the crate bobs to the surface. we can see the tiny red light on the transponder from here.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{oh. guess i did it m'self.}
<A>__{she whips back, and starts pounding at him with her fists. he is laughing so hard, he takes a few good shots before he can grasp her wrists. she spits in his face. he strikes back by... ...kissing her hard. she struggles for a beat. and then she lets him. when they finish, he reaches to unzip her jumping suit. all the way. pulls it down gently, revealing... ...her evening gown. a wrinkle free material which slips down across her legs from where it had been bunched across her hips. he is unzipping his outfit as well, revealing formal wear of his own. he stuffs the suits into his gear pack, removing only... ...her evening bag and shoes. then lifting both packs, he...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{um...}
<A>__{...flings them into the black ocean. gone.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{...i wouldn't do that.}
<A>__{so he turns. she looks really stunned. and scared.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{well...i saw our suction things. lying...over...there?}
<A>__{she points. to where no suction things are lying.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{...so i put 'em in my pack?}
<A>__{his eyes widen.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{or maybe. i put 'em there.}
<A>__{and points. to where they are. she tilts her head. gives him a great smile. is he enraged? his dry grin says, not hardly.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i like a quick study.}
<A>__{then again. you can never tell.}
