<L>__{interior aibileen's house living room day}
<A>__{aibileen sits with skeeter on the sofa reading and answering miss myrna letters. aibileen is dressed very nicely. several flower arrangements are placed around the room. an unwrapped present rests on the coffee table.}
<C>__{aibileen}
<D>__{tell her to pour vinegar in her trash cans. then them dogs will stay away.}
<A>__{as skeeter writes this down, someone walks onto aibileen's front porch. skeeter becomes worried. aibileen looks to a wall clock and smiles. about a dozen letters and cards fall into a basket under the mail slot. aibileen jumps up and starts sorting through the cards.}
<C>__{aibileen }
<D>__{today my birthday, miss skeeter.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{well, happy birthday, aibileen. you should have told me.}
<C>__{aibileen}
<D>__{and, from all over the county, my babies find they way home.}
<A>__{aibileen stops on one card in particular. she sits back down next to skeeter.}
<C>__{aibileen }
<D>__{some even from overseas. alton spears lives in paris now. married him a real pretty french girl. got five kids, too...they's my grandbabies.}
<A>__{aibileen opens the card to find a twenty dollar bill inside along with a picture of the spears family. aibileen reads the card aloud.}
<C>__{aibileen }
<D>__{i still don't drink coffee. happy birthday. love alton.}
<A>__{aibileen laughs and raises her hand to her mouth. skeeter is touched. the doorbell rings. aibileen jumps up and opens the door. a delivery man greets her with two more vases of flowers. aibileen looks out to the street where a white woman gets out of her car with a huge country ham. two little girls in matching dresses jump out behind her. the woman sees aibileen on the porch and waves. aibileen waves back and smiles. catching it all, the moment soon grows bittersweet for skeeter. she wipes her eye.}
