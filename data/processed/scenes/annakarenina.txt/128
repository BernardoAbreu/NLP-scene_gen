<L>__{exterior ladies' stand, the races, same time day}
<A>__{spectators on either side of anna and those behind and in front collectively react.}
<T>__{karenin sees that:}
<A>__{anna reacts not at all. her gaze through her glasses stays unwavering on vronsky. karenin notes this, and from then on his attention is fixed on anna. when the horses come opposite the stand, she lowers her glasses and follows frou frou taking the lead from gladiator.}
<C>__{vronsky}
<A>__{ eases frou frou past gladiator. the horses take the next jump.}
<C>__{ladies' stand}
<A>__{with one hand anna grips her folded fan. karenin's face is a mask as he watches anna unconsciously half destroying it. she raises her glasses. anna's pov through glasses frou frou approaches the last fence with gladiator half a length behind, on the near side to anna.}
<C>__{vronsky}
<A>__{ working the reins, rising and falling in rhythm with the horse, looks ahead to the winning post, and before knowing it he makes an error, losing the rhythm, dropping back into the saddle and raising the horse's head, just as frou frou takes off. anna's pov (through glasses) frou frou rises, gladiator rises. frou frou disappears. gladiator clears the fence in anna's foreground. simultaneously, there are shrieks and exclamations all around her off camera and the view through the glasses zigzags in search of frou frou, impeded by horses jumping the fence. she lowers the glasses and sees frou frou on the ground, rolling over, and vronsky on the ground.}
<C>__{countess vronsky}
<A>__{ sees this, too, her mouth set tight with contempt.}
<C>__{karenin}
<A>__{ looks shocked. almost in the same moment he hears anna's anguished cry, conspicuous in the hubbub that follows the crowd's exclamation.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{alexei . . . !}
<C>__{karenin}
<D>__{i'm here.}
<A>__{this is adroit. he comes down several steps and pushes through to offer his arm, but anna has lost control, trying to escape like a bird beating against its cage.}
<C>__{karenin }
<D>__{would you like to leave?}
<A>__{anna ignores him, puts her glasses to her eyes, searching out vronsky.}
<B>__{on the course}
<A>__{vronsky extricates himself from his broken horse and, in terrible recrimina tion, tries to pull frou frou to her feet by the reins. frou frou struggles to get up but her back is broken. officials, officers, and a doctor have come running.}
<C>__{anna}
<A>__{. . . sees an officer hurrying to the imperial party to report.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{stiva! what are they saying?}
<C>__{oblonsky}
<D>__{vronsky's unhurt but the horse . . .}
<A>__{anna relapses into sobs, attempting to hide her face behind her destroyed fan. betsy gives anna her fan.}
<C>__{vronsky}
<A>__{ is restrained by an officer.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{her back's broken!}
<A>__{the officer takes a pistol from his holster. vronsky, enraged and in grief, takes the pistol from him.}
<C>__{karenin}
<A>__{ persists with anna.}
<C>__{karenin}
<D>__{i'm asking you . . . if you wish to go . . .}
<A>__{he touches anna's arm. she jerks it away.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no, leave me alone.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{i will bring her home, alexei.}
<C>__{karenin}
<P>__{(smiling politely)}
<D>__{excuse me, princess, but anna is not well and i want her to come with me.}
<A>__{a gunshot is heard from the course. anna turns her tear streaked face towards it.}
