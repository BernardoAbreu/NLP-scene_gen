<L>__{interior doctor's office afternoon}
<A>__{close on jackie, looking down. she seems to be staring at something in her lap...}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(quiet anger)}
<D>__{i don't even know what that means. spread. that is very unclear.}
<A>__{...but there is nothing there. her lap is empty. except for her unnaturally still hands.}
<P>__{female voice (o.s., gently)}
<D>__{i means we found some cells. in your lymph nodes. in three of them.}
<A>__{the hands come together. slowly, deliberately. stating to anyone who would watch that there is no panic here.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{but the other time. you said you got it all. so you could be wrong again. one time, you say one thing, then...}
<C>__{female voice }
<D>__{the other time. was a year ago.}
<A>__{the air comes out of jackie. in a thin, slow, precise stream. everything, her very breath. under complete control.}
<C>__{female voice }
<D>__{that was a tiny lump in the breast. we radiated, we thought we had it all. we were hopeful. but there were no guarantees.}
<A>__{silence. jackie's eyes stay on her folded, still, hands.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{but we can beat it.}
<A>__{pull back to see the small, neatly kept office. dr. sweikert is}
