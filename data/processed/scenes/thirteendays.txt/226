<A>__{a few lonely business travelers hang out in the dim coffee shop. faint music plays. scali and alexander fomin sit with steaming cups of coffee. scali, nervous, unfolds a note. fomin, an expressionless gray spectre of a man, eyes him. he is, in his boredom, a spy's spy.}
<C>__{scali}
<D>__{i am instructed to tell you that the american government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. if this solution were raised at the u.n. by ambassador zorin, he would find a favorable reply from ambassador stevenson.}
<C>__{fomin}
<D>__{so i understand you correctly. if the missiles in cuba were dismantled, returned to the soviet union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the united states would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade cuba?}
<C>__{scali}
<D>__{that is correct.}
<C>__{fomin}
<D>__{this is from the highest authority?}
<C>__{scali}
<D>__{yes. from the highest authority. there are two conditions. the u.n. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.}
<C>__{fomin}
<D>__{and, of course, the u.n. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the american southeast.}
<A>__{scali demurs. he has no instructions on this count.}
<C>__{fomin }
<D>__{and the second condition?}
<C>__{scali}
<D>__{time is of the essence.}
<A>__{scali takes a sip of coffee. fomin stares at him, intense.}
<C>__{fomin}
<D>__{john. how much time?}
<C>__{scali}
<D>__{48 hours. in 48 hours there can be no deals.}
