<L>__{interior backstage crew meal night}
<A>__{russell hammond sits down on a plastic chair with a paper plate filled with buffet style food steak and baked potato. preoccupied, and several seats away from other crew members. he drinks a glass of milk. out old friend sapphire takes the seat next to him, holding a skimpy paper plate of vegetables.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{i feel bad.}
<C>__{sapphire}
<D>__{well, at least you feel. that puts you in a higher class of asshole.}
<A>__{they eat in silence. sapphire looks around. the new breed of groupies eye her, as they cruise russell on the periphery. they're bolder, flashier. she eyes them back with seniority.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{what did i do?}
<C>__{sapphire}
<D>__{well you can do what the big boys do.}
<P>__{(he looks at her)}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{the girls still circle russell nearby. he's unaware.}
<C>__{sapphire}
<D>__{you believe these new girls? none of 'em take birth control, and they eat all the steak.}
<A>__{she looks sadly at her plate of vegetables. an ever sharp mind in last night's clothes, she commands russell's respect.}
<C>__{sapphire }
<D>__{they don't even know what it id to be a fan! to blindly love some silly piece of music... or some band so much that it hurts... please, they're all just after the money. shoo }
<P>__{(in their direction)}
<D>__{go rob a bank! it's more honest!}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{is penny okay?}
<C>__{sapphire}
<D>__{the quaalude incident. yeah, it wasn't pretty. she could have died. i always warned her about letting too many guys fall in love with her. i guess i was wrong.}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{on of 'em saved her life.}
<A>__{russell nods.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{well, it's finally over with leslie. i'm going to call her.}
<C>__{sapphire}
<D>__{let her retire.}
<P>__{(he doesn't respond)}
<D>__{you want to lock her up in a house in michigan? please.}
<P>__{(he doesn't respond)}
<D>__{write her a song someday. she deserves it. something about that girl brought out the best in a lot of...}
<P>__{(looks around backstage)}
<D>__{... pretty average people. she deserves it...}
<A>__{russell stares into his crew meal, nodding a little.}
<C>__{sapphire }
<P>__{(forward thinking)}
<D>__{... because something tells me twenty years from now, we'll remember her... and not much else.}
<A>__{russell smiles to himself, knows it's true. dick passes, placing hands on russell's shoulders, massaging a little.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{have a good vacation. i hope the band stays together. before it all went down the shitter, it was starting to get really good.}
<A>__{dick claps russell on the back, and moves on. he turns to sapphire.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{i'm not going to blame myself. i do make people happy. they just shouldn't get to know me... 'cause it appears to spoil everything.}
<C>__{sapphire}
<D>__{don't be so easy on yourself.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{what gives you the right to get this personal with me.}
<C>__{sapphire}
<D>__{let's not reminisce.}
