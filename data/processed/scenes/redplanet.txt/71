<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{a call for me?}
<C>__{ozzie }
<D>__{right. from the surface of mars. i'm routing it through. direct frequencies follow.}
<A>__{there's crunch of static, then }
<C>__{gallagher }
<D>__{commander bowman?}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{you're alive?? you're alive?!}
<L>__{exterior sojourner site (mars) day}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{we're at sixty percent. lieutenant santen and bud are gone.}
<P>__{(beat: then)}
<D>__{oh, and by the way, we can breathe.}
<L>__{interior mission control night}
<C>__{skavlem}
<D>__{you can breathe??!}
<C>__{gallagher }
<D>__{not real well, but yeah.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{hey, kate...we've changed our mind. get us outta here. we'd like to come home.}
<A>__{if the room was at a standstill before, now it's frozen. is there hope?}
<C>__{skavlem}
<D>__{if they can breathe, can we live there?}
<C>__{lowenthal}
<D>__{no. ninety percent of the algae's gone. it's some kind of freak anomaly. mars is a dying planet. just like earth.}
<C>__{russert}
<D>__{they're breathing. it coulda worked. dammit, it coulda worked...}
<A>__{then through the cacophony comes one voice.}
<C>__{schlissel}
<D>__{it doesn't matter. they're going to die tonight anyhow. in an hour, the sun sets on mars. it's going to be minus 140. they cannot survive in the open. they're going to die.}
<A>__{yow. everyone shuts up. it's ugly but true.}
<C>__{lowenthal}
<D>__{he's right. you can walk across the south pole, long as you stay moving and you're wearing insulating clothing the suits'll work you can stay warm. but once they stop moving, without shelter, they're gonna die.}
<C>__{schlissel}
<D>__{her orbit could degrade at any time. she could auger in and burn while they chat about old times and freeze to death. it's a waste. we should just bring her home.}
<A>__{skavlem doesn't love it, but }
<C>__{skavlem}
<D>__{we can get a free return trajectory now. she's got enough food and water to bring one person back.}
<A>__{russert not happy at all, but }
<C>__{russert}
<D>__{you're not wrong.}
<A>__{nods to skavlem...}
<C>__{skavlem}
<D>__{commander, this is mission control.}
