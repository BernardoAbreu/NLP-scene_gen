<L>__{exterior funfair day}
<A>__{the light drizzle now falling is keeping away what few fun seekers there are left in town. the funfair is not much fun. it is the end of the season. hector and the kids are a sorry sight parading the empty alleys. the kids seem to glory in the misery of it all, getting back at hector for four years of neglect. heavy hearted, hector still tries to make a go of it.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{let's have a ride...}
<A>__{he has stopped at some dated space rockets.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{the seats are wet.}
<A>__{hector triumphs. he pulls a wad of kitchen roll from his pocket and starts to wipe the seats.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{kitchen roll, unbleached, re cycled, biodegradable... dry seats...}
<A>__{betsy has the grace to smile as the three of them climb aboard the rockets. as the attendant releases the brakes and cranks them up into the drizzle, 'round and 'round, hector knows that he has to do something to break the awful distance between him and his kids. he looks at them. they sit grimly in their rockets, one in front of him and one behind. their faces are set in expressions of what? boredom? resignation? patience? expectancy? then he realizes what is going on. they are waiting for him to open up to them, talk to them seriously, explain himself. he looks at betsy's face and sees in it the years of his absence, her stoicism, her patience, her courage. it moves him. he leans over to her.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{this is ridiculous. let's go somewhere and talk.}
<A>__{betsy smiles her small patient smile.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{all right, if you want to...}
<A>__{hector looks to thomas. thomas vigorously nods his agreement. hector is happier. he looks down on the decrepit fairground.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{how do we land these things?}
