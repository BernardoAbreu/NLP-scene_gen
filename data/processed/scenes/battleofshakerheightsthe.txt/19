<A>__{fresh flowers and a crocheted tissue box hoodie make the place cozy. kelly sits across the desk from principal holmstead, a well groomed woman with a gentle talk show host demeanor.}
<C>__{holmstead}
<D>__{what gives you the idea that you can or ought to question the curriculum?}
<A>__{kelly doesn't move. he's not into this.}
<C>__{holmstead}
<D>__{or question your teacher?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i know. i mean, who ever heard of a classroom dialog? not socrates.}
<A>__{ms. holmstead is exasperated, but she likes him in spite of herself. he's a smart cookie. she's got to change her strategy. she leans back in her chair.}
<C>__{holmstead}
<D>__{kelly, you're a very bright boy. but you're making some serious mistakes.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i don't need to. everyone else makes them for me.}
<A>__{her chair squeaks as she leans forward and looks at kelly intently.}
<C>__{holmstead}
<D>__{this anger must be masking a lot of hurt.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i was wondering what the tissues were for.}
<A>__{holmstead tries again. she looks down at his file.}
<C>__{holmstead}
<D>__{i see you're not going to college next year. what are your plans?}
<A>__{kelly shrugs. holmstead searches his face for any clues.}
<C>__{holmstead}
<D>__{how do i get through to you?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{advertisers use status and sex to appeal to my demographic.}
<A>__{she shakes her head and swings her chair towards the window and gazes out at the front walkway of the school. her face clears. something's clicked.}
<C>__{holmstead}
<D>__{i think we can come up with a punishment which might actually be more of an opportunity for you to realize your true potential.}
