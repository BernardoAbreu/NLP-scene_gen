<L>__{exterior sacrificial corridor}
<A>__{just outside the sacrificial chamber we hear a few quick gun shots. then nothing. and we know miller went down fighting.}
<L>__{interior pyramid hieroglyphics chamber}
<A>__{(intercut with interior chamber of pillar) lex returns to spy through one of the peepholes into the chamber of pillar. lex pov: the predator (scar) is gone. where is he? suddenly the predator is looking at her through the same peephole, his eye an inch from hers. lex jumps back in terror. lex pov: the predator with the predator warrior insignia on his forehead is putting his face plate back on. the face plate is marked with a similar predator warrior insignia. from now on, this predator will be known as scar. around his neck hangs the inner mouth of the alien he slew. he wears it as a trophy. scar stands calmly facing the doorway to the hieroglyphics chamber. he's waiting for the pyramid to reconfigure once more and the stone slab blocking the doorway to move.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{he's right behind that rock. waiting for the door to open.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i think when we took the guns we upset the order of how things work down here. we tipped the scales.}
<C>__{lex}
<P>__{(getting it)}
<D>__{he needs his gun back.}
<A>__{sebastian points to the slab that scar is behind.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{when that door opens we're dead.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{not if we set things right.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{this pyramid, it's like a prison. we took the guard's guns and now the prisoners are running free. to restore order, the guards need their guns.}
<A>__{sebastian just looks at her, more terrified than before.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{don't ever use that metaphor again.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{when the door opens we're going to give that thing his gun back.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{are you crazy? you want a metaphor? during a big game hunt, the animals being hunted don't arm the hunters!}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{they're not hunting us. we're in the middle of a war. it's time to pick a side.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{we're on our side.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{we have to consider the possibility that we might not make it out of here.}
<A>__{sebastian looks at her.}
<C>__{lex }
<D>__{but we have to make sure that those "serpents" don't reach the surface because if they do everything, everywhere, could die.}
<A>__{sebastian speaks slowly, not believing his own words.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{the enemy of my enemy is my friend.}
<A>__{the alarm on sebastian's watch goes off. in the distance a sound like rolling thunder. the pyramid is reconfiguring once again. lex nods to the heavy slab blocking the doorway in front of them, the one scar is behind. but as the pyramid reconfigures, that's not the door that opens. the one holding scar back remains sealed while another door opens up into a corridor where heading off to the left are the small strobe lights that lex dropped earlier marking their path to the surface, and heading off to the right is total darkness. sebastian looks at the strobe lights stretching out into the distance. he locks eyes with lex. she sighs nervously.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{let's go find our friend.}
<A>__{and lex and sebastian turns right, toward the darkness and the unknown.}
