<A>__{in the gloom we track past the crushed batmobile, the delorean and other famous cars, to find arthur sitting in kitt from `knight rider'.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{what have i done, kitt? this mistake's up there with hitler joining his school debating team...}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{go to bed, arthur.}
<A>__{arthur jumps out of his skin. but it's hobson, standing by the car holding a dressing gown and a mug of cocoa.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{and stop this self pitying bibble. you're going to be fabulously rich.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{maybe i'd rather be fabulously poor. some poor people i see look happy.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{that's either because they're far away or you've just given them money. arthur, poor people have to work. they stand for hours in the rain, waiting for buses full of other poor people to take them to things called `jobs' which they do all year round to pay for holidays away from those jobs.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{don't patronise me. i have a job.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{lying drunk on a bale of hay in riding boots being photographed by another pampered prick won't prepare you for the work i mean. and i don't want to see you suffer. take your fish oil.}
