<D>__{you know, when i started this label, my dream was to work with musicians and bands whose music i just admired so much. the person that i thought, "my god, wouldn't it be incredible to work with" was graham parker. tonight we have him. solo. because we couldn't afford to fly in the rumour.}
<A>__{the crowd applauds as graham parker (60's) leaps on stage. pete and debbie watch graham sing a very moving song. the song is fantastic and personal, but clearly not commercial. we watch debbie. although the music is great, it's a little depressing and not working on her. she quickly gets bored.}
