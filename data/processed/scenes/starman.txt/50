<L>__{interior jenny's house bedroom dawnbreak}
<A>__{jenny, sitting on the floor with her arms wrapped around her knees, is reflected in a mirror fastened to the back of the closet door. the star man edges around the door to look at himself in the glass. in baggy tan cords, a windbreaker and a plaid shirt, buttoned all the way to the neck and a button in the wrong hole halfway down the front, he looks like an innocent abroad. he notices the shirt is askew across his chest and, with his new hands, awkwardly resets the buttons. he looks himself over. his movements resemble a human's but are noticeably more precise. the clothes seem right so he leans into the mirror to inspect his face. he squeezes the skin on his cheeks, examines his eyes, turns his head as far as he can to inspect the sides of his face, folds his ears forward to check the skin behind them and he even gives a good two fisted tug to his hair to see if it is on securely. he turns from the mirror and goes over to where the .45 and a leg pouch from his life support suit are lying on the bed next to a snapshot of the man whose identity he has taken. in the picture the man is dressed exactly as the star man is now. the star man picks up the gun and the pouch and, speaking to jenny in his own language, steps to the door and motions for her to follow. jenny consciously ignores him. the star man comes over, reaches down and grabs her arm to pull her to her feet. jenny squirms back, but he holds her tight. she looks at the hand, almost touches it, then up at the familiar yet disturbingly unfamiliar face above her.}
