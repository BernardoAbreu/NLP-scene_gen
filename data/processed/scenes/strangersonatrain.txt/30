<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{exit of the tunnel}
<A>__{it is empty. there is a sudden piercing scream from inside, followed after a second or two by protestations and giggling as miriam's boat emerges into the light. she is pushing one of the boys away from her.}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(squealing)}
<D>__{george, stop it, i tell you!}
<A>__{their boat moves out of the picture, toward the island. presently bruno's boat comes smilingly following and he, too, moves on out of the picture.}
<B>__{medium shot island}
<A>__{the group of miriam and her companions are scrambling out of their boat and moving onto the island, one of the boys trying the boat on the shore. they disappear into the woods of the island. again bruno's boat comes into the picture. he steps out, lift the prow of the boat a little onto the shore.}
<B>__{long shot island}
<A>__{we see the amusement park lighted beyond the lake. silhouetted in the foreground, the trees and foliage of the island. nearby we see the silhouetted figures of miriam and her companions move across the scene, right to left. miriam is pushing george away from her.}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(protesting perfunctorily)}
<D>__{george, no!}

<C>__{george's voice}
<D>__{miriam!}
<A>__{miriam backs out of the bushes until the back of her head is in closeup in the foreground of the shot. suddenly she hears steps in back of her and turns her head toward camera. her face changes as she recognizes someone offscene.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{oh!}
<A>__{she gives a coy smile of recognition. camera pulls back to reveal the mad and shoulders of bruno between miriam and the camera. his hand holds guy's lighter which he flicks on as he raises it above miriam's face. 0f bruno, we see only the back of his head and shoulders.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{is your name miriam?}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(with surprise)}
<D>__{why yes. how did you }
<A>__{we see bruno's gloved hands dart quickly to miriam's throat. the lighter falls down out of picture, and as bruno's hands grip her throat, his head moves slightly to blot out miriam's face. his head moves a bit farther until miriam's face is nearly uncovered at the other side of the screen, and we see her glasses fall off.}
<B>__{close shot}
<A>__{miriam's glasses hit the ground. the shadows of their struggling figures over the shot.}
<B>__{close up}
<A>__{the screen is filled with one of the lenses of the glasses. they are of the diminishing type. against the moonlit sky we see reflected, the elongated struggling figures, as though we were shooting up at them. suddenly one of the figures falls forward.}
<B>__{close up}
<A>__{miriam's head drops into the picture by the glasses. bruno's hand comes into the picture and picks up the glasses. one of the lenses has been broken by miriam's fall. as we see bruno's sport shoes move away, the camera moves past miriam's head until it comes to guy's lighter pressed into the earth.}
<B>__{close up bruno}
<A>__{bruno glances back over his shoulder. he looks down and goes back one or two steps. close up bruno's hand bruno's hands retrieve the lighter from the ground.}
<B>__{long shot island}
<A>__{we see a full view of the island again, with the amusement park beyond. the faint noise of the calliope continues in the distance. bruno has been lost to view. miriam's companions are still searching for her. we hear their faint voices in the distance.}
<C>__{voices}
<D>__{miriam! miriam! where are you?}
<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{bruno comes to the shore where his boat is moored. he gets in and is quickly chugging away. he moves calmly, matter of fact and not furtively.}

<C>__{voices}
<D>__{hey, here she is! what's the matter with her? has she fainted?}
<A>__{more shouts from the island cause the people at the landing stage to look back. the boatman's attention is also attracted. suddenly, as bruno is getting out of boat, there is a loud scream from the island.}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(crying out)}
<D>__{she is dead!}
<C>__{other voice}
<P>__{(from island)}
<D>__{help! help!}
<A>__{bruno by this time has stopped onto the landing stage, and in company with the other people, is looking back as if to see what's wrong on the island. then he moves away, starting off of the landing stage. the boatman turns and glances at bruno, but quickly returns his attention to the disturbance across on the island. he hurries forward and with a couple of men passengers jumps into one of the boats. he calls to his assistant as he gets into the boat.}
<C>__{boatman}
<D>__{got a cop!}
<A>__{the assistant runs off out of the pictures}
<B>__{medium shot bruno}
<A>__{as bruno calmly threads his way along the midway, we hear above the noise of the various concessions, a shrill police whistle in the distance. presently a couple of policemen comes running from direction of the main entrance and past bruno. he glances at them over his shoulder, then strolls on toward the main entrance to the park.}
<B>__{entrance to amusement park exterior}
<A>__{as bruno comes out through the turnstile, he stands for a moment on the street. at this moment a man hesitates at the curbstone. he is blind and tapping the sidewalk with his white cane. he takes one step into the roadway, then hesitates. bruno steps forward and takes the blind man's arm. camera pulls back as bruno escorts the blind man across the road. with a sweeping gesture he holds back a couple of cars to lot them pass. once on the other side of the road, the blind man utters his thanks.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{he goes off. bruno looks back toward the park, then glances down at his wristwatch. insert bruno's wristwatch the time is 9.30.}
