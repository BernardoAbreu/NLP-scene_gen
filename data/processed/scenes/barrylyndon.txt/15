<L>__{exterior dugan manor house day}
<A>__{the air is fresh and bright, and the birds sing loud amidst the green trees. roderick is elated, and springs down the road, as brisk as a young fawn. he encounters an orderly whistling "roast beef of old england," as he cleans down a cavalry horse.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{whose horse, fellow, is that?}
<C>__{orderly}
<D>__{feller, indeed! the horse belongs to my captain, and he's a better fellow nor you any day.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{i did not stop to break his bones, as i would on another occasion, for a horrible suspicion had come across me, and i made for the garden as quickly as i could.}
<A>__{roderick see captain best and dorothy pacing the path together. her arm is under his, and he is fondling and squeezing her little hand which lies closely nestling against his arm. some distance beyond them is captain grogan, who is paying court to dorothy's sister, mysie.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{the fact is that, during the week of my illness, no other than captain best was staying at castle dugan, and making love to miss dorothy in form.}
<C>__{captain best}
<D>__{no, dorothy, except for you and four others, i vow before all the gods, my heart had never felt the soft flame.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{ah, you men, you men, john, your passion is not equal to ours. we are like like some plant i've read of we bear but one flower, and then we die!}
<C>__{captain best}
<D>__{do you mean you never felt an inclination for another?}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{never, my john, but for thee! how can you ask me such a question?}
<A>__{raising her hand to his lips.}
<C>__{captain best}
<D>__{darling dorothea!}
<A>__{roderick rushes into view, drawing his little sword.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{i pulled out a knot of cherry colored ribbons, which she had given me out of her breast, and which somehow i always wore upon me, and flung them in captain best's face, and rushed out with my little sword drawn.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{she's a liar she's a liar, captain best! draw, sir, and defend yourself, if you are a man!}
<A>__{roderick leaps at captain best, and collars him, while dorothy makes the air echo with her screams. captain grogan and mysie hasten up. though roderick is a full growth of six feet, he is small by the side of the enormous english captain. best turns very red at the attack upon him, and slips back clutching at his sword. dorothy, in an agony of terror, flings herself round him, screaming:}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{captain best, for heaven's sake, spare the child he is but an infant.}
<C>__{captain best}
<D>__{and ought to be whipped for his impudence, but never fear, miss dugan, i shall not touch him, your favorite is safe from me.}
<A>__{so saying, he stoops down and picks up the bunch of ribbons, which roderick had flung at dorothy's feet, and handing it to her, says in a sarcastic tone:}
<C>__{captain best}
<D>__{when ladies make presents to gentlemen, it is time for other gentlemen to retire...}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{good heavens, best! he is but a boy and don't signify any more than my parrot or lap dog. mayn't i give a bit of ribbon to my own cousin?}
<C>__{roderick}
<P>__{(roaring)}
<D>__{i'm a man, and will prove it.}
<C>__{captain best}
<D>__{you are perfectly welcome, miss, as many yards as you like.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{monster! your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop. but i will have my revenge, i will! roddy, will you see me insulted?}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{indeed, miss dorothy, i intend to have his blood as sure as my name's roderick.}
<C>__{captain best}
<D>__{i will send for the usher to cane you, little boy, but as for you, miss, i have the honor to wish you a good day.}
<A>__{best takes off his hat with much ceremony, and makes a low bow, and is just walking off, when michael, roderick's cousin, comes up, whose ear has likewise been caught by the scream.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{hoity toity! john best, what's the matter here?}
<C>__{captain best}
<D>__{i will tell you what it is, mr. dugan. i have had enough of miss dugan here and your irish ways. i ain't used to 'em, sir.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(good humoredly)}
<D>__{well, well! what is it? we'll make you used to our ways, or adopt english ones.}
<C>__{captain best}
<D>__{it's not the english way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, mr. dugan, i will thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and i resign all claims to this young lady. if she has a fancy for school boys, let her take 'em, sir.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{pooh! pooh! best, you are joking.}
<C>__{captain best}
<D>__{i never was more in earnest.}
<A>__{best exits.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(in a towering rage)}
<D>__{you you! hang you for a meddling brat, your hand is in everybody's pie. what business had you to come brawling and quarreling here, with a gentleman who has fifteen hundred a year?}
<A>__{michael runs after best.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<P>__{(gasps)}
<D>__{oh, i shall die; i know i shall. i shall never leave this spot.}
<C>__{captain grogan}
<P>__{(whisper to dorothy)}
<D>__{the captain is gone.}
<A>__{dorothy, giving him an indignant look, jumps up and walks towards the house.}
<C>__{captain grogan}
<P>__{(in a soothing tone to roderick)}
<D>__{this is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.}
<C>__{roderick}
<P>__{(shouts after michael)}
<D>__{the man that marries dorothy dugan must first kill me do you mind that?}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(shouting back from a distance)}
<D>__{pooh, sir. kill you flog you, you mean! i will send for nick the huntsman to do it.}
<C>__{captain grogan}
<D>__{you are a gallant lad, and i like your spirit. but what dugan says is true. it's a hard thing to give a lad counsel who is in such a far gone state as you; but, believe me, i know the world, and if you will but follow my advice, you won't regret having taken it. dorothy dugan has not a penny; you are not a whit richer. and, my poor boy, don't you see though it's a hard matter to see that she's a flirt, and does not care a pin for you or best either?}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but best will have to fight me before he marries her!}
<C>__{captain grogan}
<D>__{faith, i think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.}
<A>__{he looks hard at roderick for a second to two, then he walks away, humming a tune, looking back at roderick as he goes through the old gate out of the garden. when grogan is gone, roderick is quite alone, and he flings himself down on the bench where dorothy had made believe to faint, and had left her handkerchief and the ribbons and, taking them up, hides his face in them, and bursts into a passion of tears.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{i must have sat for some hours bemoaning myself on the garden bench, for the dinner bell clanged as usual at three o'clock, which wakened me from my reverie.}
