<A>__{in the administration corridor, a few stray zombies wander among the corpses on the floor. one large and severely wounded creature pounds on the door to the interior corridor. it had been the one which was pounding at the door upstairs. a female zombie squats near one of the corpses in the hall. she lifts its arm and moves it to her mouth, but she drops it quickly, repelled by its coldness. she leans over and picks at another corpse, then she stands and drifts towards the mall. slowly the creatures leaves the corridor and move out onto the second floor balcony. we begin to hear a voice fading in over the scene.}
