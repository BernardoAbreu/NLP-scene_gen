<L>__{interior bedroom day}
<A>__{with expert gestures, a nurse shows georges how to lie anne down and put an incontinence pad on her. she's now almost incapable of moving, and has to be turned over like an object, as tears flow silently down her face.}
<L>__{interior living room day}
<A>__{anne is at the piano and plays the piece from the scene 3. we watch her and listen to her for a while. georges is seated in his armchair and looks at the piano. finally he leans over toward the cd player and stops it. the music suddenly stops. georges remains silently seated.}

<C>__{georges}
<D>__{i added a little orange juice. i find it tastes quite good.}
<A>__{she can only swallow slowly, and so something keeps running back out of her mouth. he wipes it with a tea towel, continues to feed her. finally, after a few mouthfuls, she keeps her mouth shut.}
