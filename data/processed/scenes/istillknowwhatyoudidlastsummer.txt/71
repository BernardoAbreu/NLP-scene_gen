<A>__{derrick, the dockhand, whistles in the darkness as he coils the bow rope of a service boat around a cleat on the dock. ominous shadows play all along the dock. out on the water there's a big splash. the dockhand rises, looking out at the water with a sigh.}

<A>__{he turns away. as he does, we see}
<B>__{the end of the dock}
<A>__{where a sinister slicker figure stands perfectly still, silhouetted by moonlight. derrick paces down the dock the other way past a handfull of other tied off staff and service boats. he picks up a hose and begins spraying down the hull of a sunfish sailboat. he turns the hose off and begins coiling it, backing toward an equipment shack. suddenly, a hand touches him on the back. he jumps and turns to see }

<P>__{(to the fish)}
<D>__{hello, little sea bass. you're lucky i'm busy or i'd hook you myself.}
<A>__{we push in as his face gets closer to the water and then rising slowly from the dark water directly behind the dockhand a sinister slicker. derrick hears a splash and just in time for... splat! the old hook in the eye. the fisherman pulls him down. he screams ben yanks on the hook and derrick's crumpled body falls}
