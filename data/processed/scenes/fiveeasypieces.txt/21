<L>__{interior bowling alley night}
<A>__{bobby lifts his ball from the return rack, moves to the lane and bowls a perfect strike. making a self congratulatory gesture of triumph, he turns back to: elton, seated at the scoring table. his wife, stoney, is seated beside rayette on the horseshoe banquette. as he addresses rayette, we note that elton's two front teeth are missing.}
<C>__{elton}
<P>__{(okie accent)}
<D>__{your ball, ray.}
<C>__{rayette}
<P>__{(reluctant)}
<D>__{is this suppose to be fun?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{go on, get up there...}
<A>__{she rises and moves to the rack.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{... and stay relaxed this time.}
<A>__{picking up ball, she moves to the head of the lane and slings it down the alley, watching hopefully as... ... it rolls off to the right and takes only one pin.}
<B>__{on bobby}
<A>__{as she moves to her second ball.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{now don't loft it, just release it like i told you.}
<B>__{on rayette}
<A>__{as she bowls the ball down the right hand rut and comes back to the banquette, apologizing:}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{the ball's too heavy for me, honey...}
<A>__{he looks past her to stoney, about to bowl her ball.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{it's not the damn ball.}
<A>__{and as stoney bowls a strike, rayette hugs his arm.}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{i'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no, i'm not mad at you, hand. it'll be all right. just spot and follow through...}
<A>__{and as elton bowls a strike...}
<C>__{bobby }
<P>__{(mumbling)}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{he gets up and passes elton on his way to the rack.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{nice ball, el.}
<A>__{rayette, to stoney as she watches bobby prepare to bowl:}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{id'n he somethin' to see?}
<A>__{and as he makes another strike and returns to the banquette, she gets up and throws her arms around him. he returns her embrace, smiling over her shoulder at: two heavily made up young women (twinky and betty) taking possession of the adjacent lane. (note that betty is of diminutive proportions, while twinky is amazonian.)}
<C>__{rayette }
<D>__{is it my turn again?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{right. now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? give me some form...}
<A>__{he remains standing, watching as she throws another gutter ball and then comes back toward him, alibi ing:}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{i can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{will you just do what the hell i tell you...}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{i did, didn' i, el?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you got another ball comin'.}
<A>__{she moves to the rack and, concentrating hard, advances down the lane and releases the ball. it rolls slowly down the center, hits at precisely the right spot and clears the pins.}
<C>__{elton}
<D>__{atta boy, ray!}
<A>__{ecstatic, she comes back to the banquette, seating herself beside bobby and trying to solicit a response from him.}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{that was damn good, wad'n it? i finally did it...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yeah, great.}
<P>__{(begins removing his bowling shoes)}
<D>__{why don't you throw z's for 19 frames, and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game? just wonderful.}
<A>__{turning to address the two young women over the back of the banquette.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{wasn't it, ladies?}
<C>__{twinky}
<P>__{(pointing at herself)}
<D>__{are you talking to us?}
<A>__{rayette pulls off her rental shoes and throws them to the floor.}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{i'm gonna go wait in the car.}
<A>__{he stretches his arms out on the back of the banquette as though he intends to reside there awhile.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yeah, why don't you do that.}
<A>__{she grabs her sling back and her purse and as she gets up:}
<C>__{stoney}
<D>__{wait an i will i go with you, honey...}
<A>__{as she picks up her belongings and follows rayette:}
<C>__{elton}
<P>__{(changing his shoes)}
<D>__{we gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. why'nt you an' ray come on over.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{okay. go ahead. i will settle up for the beers...}
<P>__{(hands him the bowling shoes)}
<D>__{an' walk rayette over with you, will you.}
<A>__{elton moves off and bobby, now full of remorse, slumps into a depressed reverie. beyond him, betty and twinky, can be seen, engaged in some discussion concerning him. a waitress with a tray approaches and leans down to him.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{can i get you anything else?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no. how much do i owe you?}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{five'll do it.}
<A>__{he takes some loose bills from his pocket and lays them on her tray. she thanks him and moves off. as he reaches down and pulls on one of his boots, twinky approaches behind him and leans down over the back of the banquette.}
<C>__{twinky}
<D>__{we been wantin' to ask you something. are you the guy on yv?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{am i on tv?}
<C>__{twinky}
<P>__{(pointing lo betty)}
<D>__{she says you're the one that sells all the cars on tv.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{well, i don't claim to have sold 'em all. they still have some left, i believe.}
<A>__{betty appears on the other side of the banquette.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{see, i told you it was him...}
<P>__{(then to bobby)}
<D>__{your name's donnie something, right?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i leave it to you.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{my name is shirley, but they call me betty, and her name's twinky.}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(looking to twinky)}
<D>__{twinky?}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(explaining)}
<D>__{yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(looking from one to the other)}
<D>__{well, betty and twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. i just wish i had more time...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{that's a wig you wear, isn't it?}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(touching his hair)}
<D>__{a wig?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{yeah, i told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on tv you're mostly bald in the front.}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(to twinky)}
<D>__{your little friend's real sharp there...}
<P>__{(to betty)}
<D>__{yeah, i don't like to wear the wig on tv, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. i just like to wear it when i'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. i think it gives me a little more class, don't you?}
<C>__{twinky}
<D>__{oh, definitely...}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(looking at his hairline)}
<D>__{yeah, but i can see a little bitty of the net up there, that's what give it away.}
<C>__{twinky}
<D>__{it's so weird to see you in person, but that's who she says you are.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(to her)}
<D>__{it is him, he said it's him.}
<P>__{(to bobby)}
<D>__{aren't you.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yeah, you could say it's me.}
<A>__{twinky reaches over to the scoring table, picking up a pencil and a score sheet.}
<C>__{twinky}
<D>__{i'm gonna give you our number, donnie, just in case...}
<P>__{(as she writes)}
<D>__{we're both professionals, if you didn't guess.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{well, you seem very professional...}
<C>__{twinky}
<P>__{(handing the score sheet to him)}
<D>__{i always tell everyone the same thing. i got rolled and beat up real bad recently, and since then it's two for one, an' i work strictly in tandem with betty...}
<A>__{he glances at the dwarfish betty.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yeah, i can see how she'd come in handy.}
