<L>__{int exterior greyhound bus parking lot afternoon}
<D>__{we're inside the bus, sitting next to a man, little charles, thirty seven, rangy and awkward. he stares pensively out at the passing pawhuska storefronts as the bus slows, pulls into a parking lot next to the bank. he spots charlie, waiting, drinking a coke. little charles exhales, stands. steps reluctantly out into the heat.}
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{i'm sorry, dad.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no need to apologize.}
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{i know mom's mad at me.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{don't worry about her.}
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{what did she say?}
<C>__{charlie}

<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{i set the alarm. i did.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i know you did.}
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{i loved uncle bev, you know that.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{stop apologizing.}
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{the power must've gone out. i woke up and the clock was blinking noon. that means the power went out, right?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{i missed his funeral!}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's a ceremony. it's ceremonial. it doesn't mean anything compared to what you have in your heart.}
<P>__{(and, then)}
<D>__{hold on, comb your hair. charlie hands little charles his comb.}
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{uncle bev must be disappointed in me.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{your uncle bev has got bigger and better things ahead of him. he doesn't have time for spite. he wasn't that kind of man anyway charlie starts for the driver's side, stops when he sees little charles weeping. returns to him, comforts him.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{hey, hey. it's okay. it's okay, now...}
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{just... i know how things are. i know how they feel about me and something like this... you want to be there for people, and i missed uncle bev's funeral, and i know how they feel about me }
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{how who feels about you? feels what about you?}
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{all of them. i know what they say.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{they don't say things about you }
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{i see how they are. i don't blame them. i'm sorry i let you down, dad.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you haven't let me down. you never let me down. now listen...you're wrong about these people, they love you. some of them haven't gotten a chance to see what i see: a fine man, very loving, with a lot to offer. now take this...}
<P>__{(a handkerchief)}
<D>__{give me my comb. stand up straight, look folks in the eye. stop being so hard on yourself.}
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{i love you, dad.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{love you too, son.}
