<L>__{interior passage night}
<A>__{the house is quiet and in darkness as they walk along the passage and down the stairs to the washing room. hector walks behind, casting the light on lucinnius's crumpled, defeated form. lucinnius begins to sob, at first quietly, then more loudly and more pathetically. hector looks around and behind him, afraid, or perhaps hoping, that lucinnius's moans will wake the household.}
<L>__{interior wash room night}
<A>__{lucinnius has worked himself into a dramatic state of distress, with drink and terror and self pity. he runs into the tiled washing room, wails loudly and makes a stabbing motion at his stomach. hector sees all of this from behind as he enters the room. lucinnius crumples to the floor and squats on his knees. he calls out in pain.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{oh, that hurts, that stings!}
<A>__{lucinnius sits back on the step of the washing pool, holding his stomach. hector sits down beside him. they both look down at the blade, still in lucinnius' body.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{this is hopeless.}
<A>__{they sit absurdly like this for a long moment, neither of them knowing what do do nexterior it's awkward, like in a waiting room. then lucinnius speaks.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{help me, hector...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you've done it... you've done it ... lie down...}
<A>__{hector speaks gently, like coaxing a frightened animal. he helps lucinnius lie out on the marble floor.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{close your eyes... you did it...}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{thank you, thank you.}
<A>__{the movement has increased the spread of blood over lucinnius' clothing. he raises his head.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{you do it now, hector... hurry...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{lie still... lie still...}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{do it hector... do it... you promised...}
<A>__{it looks as if hector is playing for time.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{shush... i will need the knife...}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{take it... do it...}
<A>__{lucinnius' voice is fading now. hector waits, then reaches down for the knife in lucinnius' stomach. we see on his face the effort as he pulls at it, and do we detect a subtle twisting of the blade to speed lucinnius on his way? lucinnius sighs and twitches a little. it's as if the life flows out of him as the knife is released from the wound. his voice is even more fainterior}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{do it, hector... do it... do it...}
<A>__{hector has the knife in his hand, but still he waits, looking at lucinnius, willing the last dregs of life from him.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{do it... do it... do it...}
<A>__{the whispers fade to a croak. lucinnius lies still. hector has won this final battle of wills. he stands up, suddenly repulsed by what has happened. but quickly he gathers his wits. he makes his decision. he throws the knife down. it clatters along the hard shiny floor. hector has run out of the room before it has come to rest against the wall.}
