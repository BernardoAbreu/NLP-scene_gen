<A>__{on the word "ease", spicoli curls his finger into one of the mustang steering wheel bubbles and whips it clockwise. the idea is to turn off onto a side street and head back to the party. but instead, at the moment of the hairpin turn, l.c. is attempting to switch the radio station. spicoli crooks his finger farther into the bubble than he expected. the car swings in a complete circle, a circle that includes a bright yellow fire hydrant. the hydrant rips the side of the car open like a can of tuna. there is a silent moment of terror.}

<B>__{montage of shots}
<A>__{as we see ridgemont high gearing up for its big homecoming game against lincoln. we see a series of shots of kids talking about it, wagering on the chances of a ridgemont victory. we see the many signs and placards all over school, proclaiming ridgemont revenge. we see students lining up to vote for homecoming king and queen in the gymnasium. it is the most spirit that ridgemont has shown this year.}
