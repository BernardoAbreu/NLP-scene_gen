<D>__{a sober, contrite fred comes down the runway in early light. as he reaches the electra, he sees a pile of discarded objects on the tarmac... ...metal containers, carton of oranges, parachutes. bedrolls, cold weather gear. souvenirs from their stops: flags, a metal plaque, native crafts, a welcome miss amelia earhart banner. as he studies the pile... ...a coffee pot comes flying out of the plane to roll at his feet. suddenly, a 10 pound coffee tin sails past, as he ducks. amelia appears at the hatch, sees him.}

<D>__{you're finding the range. but it might be easier to just shoot me. she stares at him for a moment. a subdued voice...}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{traveling light, that's all. she sits on the lip of the hatch. her legs dangling. her eyes down.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{got room for 190 pounds of asshole? no answer. she's still looking down. he's never seen her like this.}
<P>__{fred (cont’d)}
<D>__{ma'am, i am so sor...}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{it’s fine. her eyes come up.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{everything is. he doesn't understand, but he’s glad to be forgiven. she takes a letter from her pocket. runs her finger over the envelope.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{i can run into town before we go. get that in the post for you. she shakes her head slowly.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{it’s for my husband. i'm going to hand it to him. so i can watch his face as he reads it. she sniffles slightly.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{it's our tradition.}
