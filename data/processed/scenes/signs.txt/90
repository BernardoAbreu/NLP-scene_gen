<A>__{graham steps into the kitchen. his hair is messed. his shirt has a few leaves from corn stalks stuck to it. he locks the back door. the children don't notice his presence. they're splashing each other at the sink as they clean the dinner dishes. graham looks through the kitchen doorway to the family room. he sees merrill there. merrill's hands are in his pockets as he stares at the wooden baseball bat mounted above the fireplace. merrill doesn't notice him either. graham takes two steps to the kitchen table and slowly takes a seat. his breathing is a slow controlled pant. he runs one shaky hand through his hair as he gathers himself and thinks. his kind eyes stare down at the ground as he slows his mind. beat. merrill is the first to notice him. he moves from where the baseball bat is hung, into the kitchen. as he passes the children at the sink, he turns off the faucet. the children stop playing and look up to merrill. they follow his stare to the kitchen table. beat. graham looks up at them.}
