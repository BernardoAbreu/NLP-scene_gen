<L>__{400 t shirts, boxes of grapefruit.}
<P>__{duke (v o cont'd)}
<D>__{luckily, i had taken the soap and grapefruit and other luggage out to the car a few hours earlier. now it was only a matter of slipping the noose...}
<A>__{duke shifts into drive. deliverance!}
<C>__{clerk's voice}
<D>__{mr. duke!}
<A>__{duke freezes.}
<C>__{clerk's voice}
<D>__{mr. duke! we've been looking for you!}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{the game was up! they had me.}
<C>__{duke}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{well, why not? many fine books have been written in prison.}
<A>__{resigned, duke turns off the ignition. a young clerk arrives breathlessly with a smile and a yellow letter in his}
<B>__{hand.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{sir?}
<P>__{(thrusts out a telegram)}
<D>__{this telegram came for you. actually, it isn't for you. it's for somebody named thompson, but it says 'care of raoul duke'. does that make sense?}
<C>__{duke}
<P>__{(barely able to speak)}
<D>__{yes... it makes sense.}
<A>__{duke stuffs the telegram into his top pocket. the clerk peers into the car sees part of the enormous stash inside.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{i checked the register for this man thompson. we don't show him but i figured he might be part of your team.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{he is. don't worry, i will get it to him.}
<A>__{he fires up the engine eases the red shark into low gear. security guards are looking across sharing a quiet word or two.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{what confused us was dr. gonzo's signature on the telegram from los angeles. when we knew he was right here in the hotel.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{you did the right thing. never try to understand a press message. about half the time we use codes especially with dr. gonzo.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{tell me. when will the doctor be awake?}
<C>__{duke}
<P>__{(tenses)}
<D>__{awake? what do you mean?}
<A>__{duke's eyes are on the security guards moving closer.}
<C>__{clerk}
<P>__{(uncomfortably)}
<D>__{well... the manager, mr. heem, would like to meet him. nothing unusual. mr. heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{of course. but if i were you, i'd leave the doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. he's a very crude man.}
<A>__{duke edges the car forward, but is stopped by the clerk.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{but he will be available? perhaps later this morning?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{look. that telegram was all scrambled. it was actually from thompson, not to him. western union must have gotten the names reversed. i have to get going. i have to get out to the track.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{there's no hurry! the race is over!}
<C>__{duke}
<P>__{(taking off)}
<D>__{not for me.}
<A>__{he waves the clerk off the car roars away.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{let's have lunch!}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{righto!}
