<L>__{exterior interior scotty's jamaican restaurant. day.}
<A>__{a neighborhood place, but on the other side of the parkway from the buchmans' neighborhood. friendly, bustling, kids on bikes and skateboards, etc. large windows offer a view of a stop sign, fanny's beauty salon, soul to soul liquor, a barber shop, etc. the restaurant is fluorescently lit, with a jamaican flag on the wall and photos of muhammad ali, malcolm x, and bob marley. there is a counter at the front where you place your order and pick up your food. there is a foosball table, and a pinball machine. kym and kieran are playing foosball at the ancient table where someone has painted jamaican jerseys on all the players. they are both viciously competitive and genuinely irritated with each other.}
<C>__{kieran}
<D>__{your hand is on the turf.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{what turf?}
<C>__{kieran}
<D>__{the turf. the table.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{kieran}
<D>__{so we have to do it over now. it was your shot and you get to do it over.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{kieran}
<D>__{don't tell me you didn't know having one hand on the turf makes the play null.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{null. maybe we should just play pinball.}
<A>__{c u. the metal balls ricocheting around the interior of the machine.}
<C>__{kieran}
<D>__{sometimes playing next to each other is easier than playing together.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{who told you that?}
<C>__{kieran}
<D>__{my mom. she runs a pre school.}
<A>__{they both crack up.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{what's hawaii like?}
<C>__{kieran}

<C>__{kym}
<D>__{uh uh.}
<C>__{kieran}
<D>__{it's beautiful. i've got a nice place. my horse lives there.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{most people say "my girlfriend lives there" or "my wife lives there."}
<C>__{kieran}
<D>__{i live there and so does my horse. he's very possessive. we're working through it.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{have you had him a long time?}
<C>__{kieran}
<D>__{yes. i may be a degenerate dope fiend but i love my horse. i don't have a wife or a girlfriend and i've been clean almost seven years. you could just ask, you know. your sister doesn't ask direct questions either. she's incredibly cryptic.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{that's a shrink thing, not a genetic thing.}
