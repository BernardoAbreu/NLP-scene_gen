<B>__{blade}
<A>__{surfaces from the cask in morbidly glorious slow motion. think of sheen in the end sequence of apocalypse now, only instead of a river of mud, blade is covered head to toe in crimson. majestic and glistening. a primordial god. he rears back his head, letting loose a triumphal roar. reinhardt's men hesitate. one look at blade's eyes and we can see he's tapped into a well spring of fury even he never knew he had. the man is super charged and ready for war. blade tears into the vampires, unleashing a blizzard of martial arts moves. he powers a right hook into the first vampire's face, then pivots, launching a devastating spinning back fist into the face of a second. at the same time, he rips the second guard's security belt from his waist, twirling it around nanchadku style to blind a third guard and capture the wrist of a fourth. some vampires fire their guns, but blade is a whirlwind, shifting and dodging. bullets go wild, hitting circuitry, exploding apart cannisters of combustible chemicals. in seconds, flames are licking across the laboratory floor. blade drops, causing a pair of vampires to fire their guns at one another. then blade knocks two more vampires onto their asses with a foot sweep. then he's up again. slamming the bridge of a fifth vampire's nose into his brain with a palm heel strike. a snap kick, an overhand elbow strike, a knee stamp that shatter's the vampire's knee cap. an upward block, a jab, a cross, a shin kick aimed at a vamp's quadriceps. overhand punches, rising punches, parallel punches, spinning rear elbows, deep kicks, on and on and on and on in an orgy of super hero violence until wham! blade cuts the last of the vampire soldiers down, turning from the creature's disintegrating body to face }
<B>__{reinhardt}
<A>__{the vampire mercenary clutches blade's sword in his hand, but the weapon provides him with little sense of security given that he's just seen a dozen of his men slaughtered. the automatic sprinkler system is on now, spraying water down upon blade and reinhardt alike. blade advances. reinhardt's been cornered. there's nowhere else for him to run. refusing to be cowed, reinhardt screams and brings the sword down at blade's head when whoosh but blade swings his hands upward, slapping them on either side of the blade, trapping the sword on its downward arc. reinhardt strains, trying to tear the sword away from blade's grip. the vampire's eyes widen in fear. and during that split second in which the two men are frozen, connected by the weapon which vibrates between them, blade says:}

<D>__{tell me something, chief. can you blush?}
<A>__{twhish! the sword twists free from reinhardt's grasp, spinning upward into the air. reinhardt stumbles backwards against the blood cask railing as blade catches the sword on its way down, swinging it around in one fluid motion, slicing reinhardt's torso in half, along with a diagonal axis! reinhardt sinks to his knees as the two halves split apart, turning to ash before they hit floor. beat. blade stands beneath the spray of the overhead sprinklers, rinsing the blood from his body. he turns towards the exit, sword in hand.}
