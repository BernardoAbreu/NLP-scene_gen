A faded label on his corroded chest plate: "Waste Allocation Loader - Earth Class" (WALL-E) Wall-E spits out a cube of trash. Stacks it with the others. Something catches his eye.

She is watching the ship rise into the clouds. Waits until it is completely out of sight... ...then Eve rises high up into the air. She flies around the bay. Soars like a graceful bird. Does loops in the sky. Zooms right past Wall-E's rock. He is hypnotized. Eve descends gently to the ground... Wall-E sneaks up closer. Hides behind another boulder. Slips. Makes a NOISE. Instantly, Eve whips around. Her arm converts into a LASER CANNON. Blasts Wall-E's boulder to smithereens. ...Smoke clears...All quiet. Eve, now cold and dangerous. Scans the area. No sign of life.
