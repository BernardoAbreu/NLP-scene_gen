<L>__{exterior machine shop parking lot night}
<A>__{ a massive explosion ripping through an industrial building. banks of windows blow outwards, fire rolls, brick walls crumble, raining debris everywhere. a screaming, burning man goes tumbling into the night air. buoyed by the explosion, his body flies upward, trailing fire like a human comet. more men (vampires) race out, some of them on fire.}

<A>__{as a formidable figure resolves out of the swirling flames. it's blade, striding towards us in slow motion, body bristling with weapons, the exaggerated sounds of his footfalls ringing out like drums of doom. he looks like the god of war. whoosh! we ramp back up to real time. then faster as a trio of vampire low lifes (stone, gedge, and campbell) run for their lives towards their vehicles. two modified street racing cars are pulling out; a mustang and an eagle talon. gedge is climbing into the talon even as it starts to move, pulling the door shut. at the same time stone and campbell climb atop two stretched and lowered hardtail chopper cycles. blade starts forward, drawing two of his custom mach pistols, but the mustang comes screaming in reverse towards him! blade makes a super human leap over the speeding car. momentarily upside down, he fires through the windshield and engine block as he flips. within the car, the vampires ash. the mustang explodes. flipping over and blade, now facing frontward again, continues to fire as he lands, aiming at the talon and the choppers, which haul ass out of the parking lot, swerving into the traffic on the street beyond. blade keeps firing until he's out of bullets. then }

<D>__{no more bullets, blade? guess it's time for you to fall down and go boom.}
<A>__{four stranded vampires, from the conflagration, their clothes still smoking, surround blade. call them emond, doh, denlinger, and ellingson. blade holsters his mach pistols. then reaches for a wicked looking chain knife strapped to his thigh. the knife has a button on either side of the hilt. as ellingson rushes him blade triggers the first button. zzzing! the knife blade ejects from the hilt, trailing outward six feet on a razored chain. the blade penetrates ellingson's chest. he gasps as he starts to ash. but before his disintegration is complete blade hits the second button. the knife blade retracts, the razored chain whirring back into the knife hilt. blade spins, triggers the first button again the knife blade flies out, the razored chain whipping around denlinger's throat. blade tugs. the razor chain cuts through denlinoer's neck, decapitates him. as he ashes blade triggers the knife again. as it ejects, he whirls it over his head, making a sound like a bull roarer. blade drops low, swinging the razored chain. the chain slices through emond's legs. emond's amputated legs ash, the rest of him tumbling onto the asphalt. he screams. blade retracts the knife blade, whirls, thrusts it through doh's abdomen. who was coming up from behind. as doh ashes, blade returns to emond, finishing him off and blade is on the move again, rushing after the vampires who escaped.}
