<A>__{max with his stethoscope to meeta's baby. meeta in a brightly colored sari and a lot of bracelets and aloka looks on. poomina clings to the wall.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{he's just malnourished. is she giving him the milk we gave her or selling it?}
<A>__{aloka asks meeta in hindi. meeta clearly swears she's giving the baby the milk. aloka pushes her.}
<C>__{aloka}
<D>__{not all. most.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{tell her to give all the milk to the baby.}
<A>__{aloka does so as max bounces the baby, coos to it play fully. the baby pees all over him. aloka translates quickly. meeta starts apologizing. poomina can't help laughing. max reminds meeta that that's once for each of the two weeks of the baby's life. aloka soothes meeta as she hustles her, poomina, and the baby out, then quickly begins to wipe max's face with a clean rag. this isn't something she's accustomed to doing, but she's doing it before she has time to think. max finds himself conscious of her closeness to him... and then she becomes suddenly self conscious and she backs off, ducks her head. he peeks up under.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{psst.}
<A>__{she looks at him.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<A>__{he smiles. so does she.}
