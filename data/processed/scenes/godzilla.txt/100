<A>__{godzilla moves into the square. the military hunkers down, ready to strike. cautiously the beast moves over to the mountain of fish.}

<C>__{sergeant o'neal}
<D>__{let 'em fly!}
<A>__{angle street level same all the soldiers put on their gas masks. a team of eight, pull out a gas canisters and yank the releases. they drop them down the long barrels of air cannons, preparing to fire. sand bag fortification same nick runs past the fortification, trying to get a closer look. the young officer yells after him.}
<C>__{young officer}
<D>__{where're you going? nick!}
<A>__{nick stops briefly as the young officer tosses a gas mask to nick who quickly puts it on and dashes for a closer spot. suddenly sailing over his head we see...}
<B>__{gas canisters}
<A>__{firing from the air cannons, the gas canisters streak across the sky landing behind godzilla. the yellow gas forms a wall of smoke that drifts upwards. another angle opposite corner across the way eight more canisters are fired at the beast. quickly godzilla is surrounded by the gas fumes. angle nick frustrated at his inability to see through the smoke, he dashes forward over to a large bronze statue.}
<B>__{godzilla}
<A>__{the smoke annoying and distracting him, godzilla spins, his tail waving the smoke away. but the smoke returns. godzilla yells out. frustrated he rears back and blasts! for the first time we see the infamous power breath of godzilla. with amazing force the smoke, canisters, cars and anything that isn't nailed down sails backwards from the intense pressure. nick is hit by the wave of air pressure and is sent flying backwards, impossibly high in the air. an enormous fabric banner advertising this season at the met, catches nick who slides down the banner, hitting the ground, hard. just as he looks up he sees...}
<B>__{a large truck}
<A>__{tumbling toward him from the power breath. nick scrambles to his feet just in time as the rolling truck smashes into the building behind where he just sat. angle troops fortification the troops have to scatter as the tumbling trucks and cars are flung at them, disabling their attack forces. trucks and rocket launches are crushed by the tumbling debris. godzilla continues to blow at everything around him. cars and trucks rolling. soldiers diving for cover. it's chaos. the glass in all the surrounding buildings shatter, shards of glass raining down. windows, street lamps, all blown out by the tremendous gale force winds.}
