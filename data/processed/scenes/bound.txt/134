<L>__{interior hall night}
<A>__{working the lock, corky hears violet's scream cut off. she feels the tumblers click, and rotates the cylinder. a shadow stirs under the crack of the door as she hears something that sounds like footsteps. corky freezes. corky presses down low against the door beneath the peephole. she can almost feel caesar beyond the door, but grits her teeth and turns the doorknob.}
<L>__{interior apartment night}
<A>__{the door cracks open and corky slips in, gun first. as she moves into the room, we see caesar behind her. he puts his gun to her head.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{drop the fucking gun or die!}
<A>__{corky hesitates.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{drop it!}
<A>__{she does.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{turn around.}
<A>__{rising from her crouch, she turns and he recognizes her.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{you!? holy fucking christ! you gotta be kidding me!}
<A>__{he starts to laugh when she strikes knocking the gun, she punches him, slamming him back against the door as she twists, diving, grabbing her gun, just as he steps and kicks her full in the face.}
