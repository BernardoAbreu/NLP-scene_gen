<T>__{dissolve:}
<L>__{interior the incomplete living room location #1 day}
<A>__{a dozen hammers, saws, trowels, etc. are heard in other parts of the house busily rasping and banging away. jim and muriel and bill appear in the doorway before entering the rough unfinished interior of what will eventually be the living room.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what's this, another closet?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{this happens to be our dining room.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{not the dining room, dear, the living room.}
<P>__{(indicates)}
<D>__{there's the fireplace.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{then where's the dining room?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{maybe it's that little room off the hallway.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{that's the breakfast nook.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{it's not the breakfast nook, it's the powder room.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{do me a favor don't ever invite me here for a meal.}
<A>__{two workmen pass by carrying a few long pieces of lumber. the workmen don't see the blandings.}
<C>__{first workman}
<D>__{i don't figure this blandings at all. if you gotta build on the windiest hill in connecticut, why do you have to pick the windiest side of the hill?}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(to workman)}
<D>__{you know these new york millionaires they're eccentric.}
<A>__{the workmen pass from view.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i think i'd like to go outside.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(gesture to door)}
<D>__{after you, rockefeller.}
<A>__{as they enter the foyer, a carpenter appears.}
<C>__{carpenter}
<P>__{(to jim)}
<D>__{just the man i want to see. would you step over here a second?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(indicating)}
<D>__{i will browse around upstairs.}
<A>__{as bill starts up the stairs, jim and muriel follow the carpenter.}
<C>__{carpenter}
<P>__{(pointing up)}
<D>__{on them second floor lintels between the lally columns, do you want we should rabbet them or not?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(lost)}
<D>__{the second floor lallys?}
<C>__{carpenter}
<D>__{the second floor lintels, between the lallys.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{oh. oh, the lintels between the lallys?}
<C>__{carpenter}
<D>__{yeah. from the blueprints you can't tell. you want they should be rabbeted?}
<A>__{jim throws a brief look at muriel who is regarding him skeptically.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{un umm. no, i guess not.}
<C>__{carpenter}
<D>__{okay, you're the doctor.}
<P>__{(calls)}
<D>__{hey, fellas, you got any of them rabbeted lintels set, rip 'em out!}
<A>__{after the sheerest pause there comes a shriek of nails brutally withdrawn from timber, a loud splintering of wood and then something of the appearance of entrails comes hurtling down end over end landing with a dusty slap at jim's feet. the carpenter exits. muriel gives jim an accusing look.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(sheepishly)}
<D>__{it sounded less... expensive to say no.}
<A>__{there is another loud screech and more "entrails" come hurtling down, narrowly missing them. muriel yells in the direction from which they came.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{stop it! stop it!}
<A>__{from upstairs comes a long, shrill whistle. instantly all sound of activity ceases and a voice is heard.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{okay, fellas, let's quit!}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(to muriel)}
<D>__{now look what you've done.}
<A>__{as muriel turns with apprehension, eighteen workmen come trooping down the stairs.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(conciliatory)}
<D>__{look, men, mrs. blandings didn't mean anything.}
<P>__{(the workmen regard him curiously)}
<D>__{i mean, there's no point in walking off a job just because... a woman makes a silly little remark.}
<C>__{workman}
<D>__{it's saturday, mister. we quit at twelve o'clock. this ain't a chain gang, you know.}
<A>__{as the workmen exit the blandings look at each other a little sheepishly, start up the stairs. crane shot as the blandings go up the stairs crane shot as the blandings go up the stairs.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{i'm just sick. from the outside this house looks like a grain elevator, and on the inside everything's miles too small.}
<A>__{as they reach the second floor landing, we hear, o.s. a steady but muffled pounding. they stop as they hear the thumping.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what's what?}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{that noise listen.}
<P>__{(again the thumping)}
<D>__{it's coming from the closet!}
<A>__{they rush to the closet, open the heavy oak door. bill is inside, leaning disgustedly against the wall.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{the door blew shut. i got locked in.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{impossible. i had this closet built especially for myself. the lock opens from the inside.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{maybe for houdini not for me.}
<A>__{as bill starts to step out, jim detains him.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{nothing to it. a child could work it. look, i will show you.}
<A>__{he steps inside with bill, firmly closes the door. a moment's pause. the door re opens.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(condescendingly)}
<D>__{you see, it just takes a little good old yankee know how.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{you know, dear, it's just possible the lock worked for you and not for bill.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{ridiculous. even you could do it.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{come on, i will show you.}
<A>__{he ushers muriel inside and the door closes on the threesome. the camera remains on the closed door.}
<C>__{jim's voice}
<D>__{go ahead, dear, just open it.}
<A>__{the knob turns, jiggles a little, but the door remains closed.}
<C>__{muriel's voice}
<D>__{i don't seem to be able to }
<C>__{jim's voice}
<D>__{here, let me show you! you just take the knob and turn it clockwise.}
<A>__{an efficient clockwise turn of the knob. pause. an impatient doubletwist of the knob. pause. a more forceful rattling of the knob, plus a slight kick. a furious rattling, pounding and kicking. the door remains closed.}
