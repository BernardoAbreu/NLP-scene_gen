<T>__{this throws us into a teaching montage:}
<A>__{jake and neytiri kneel together inside hometree. neytiri touches her lips with her fingertips.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{seyri.}
<A>__{she touches her nose, her ears, her eyes in quick sequence.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{ontu, mikyun, nari.}
<A>__{neytiri stands next to him, correcting his position as he draws a longbow. barking commands, she smacks him on the shoulder, then the elbow, repositioning him roughly.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{neytiri thinks i'm some kind of retard.}
<A>__{human jake emerges from the link to see trudy and norm caught in the act on norm's bunk. norm blushes and trudy waves, pulling the blanket over their heads.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{norm's attitude has improved lately.}
<A>__{norm works with jake at the small table in the shack kitchen.}
<C>__{norm}
<D>__{thank you?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{ireiyo.}
<A>__{norm comically exaggerates the pronunciation.}
<C>__{norm}
<D>__{irrrreiyo. irrrreiyo. you've gotta roll the r, r r r oll it.}
<A>__{norm makes jake repeat the word, getting more frustrated.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{it's good he's back on board, but he thinks i'm a retard too.}
<A>__{tracking with jake's feet as he runs over rocks, leaping onto a thick root, running on across the rough bark.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{my feet are getting tougher. i can run farther every day.}
<A>__{neytiri leads him along a massive root, and soon they are running 30 meters above the ground. he sprints with her through the trees, trying to keep up. she climbs and leaps with the ease of a spider monkey.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{i have to trust my body to know what to do. with neytiri it's learn fast or die.}
<A>__{neytiri leaps off into space, falling, falling until she catches an enormous palm leaf and, gripping it, allows its droop to slow her fall. she lets go, plummeting, and catches another. jake follows in a leap of faith. the camera plunges with him, from leaf to leaf, down and down in a dizzying kinetic rush. he drops down from the last leaf, landing next to her on a game trail. he is exhilarated to still be alive. neytiri is surprised that he followed. that he lived. tight on human jake, in the shack. thinking as he looks at the pictures of grace with the laughing kids at the school. in the commons avatar norm formally greets mo'at. the matriarch looks on as grace kneels to hug children she knows. grace's eyes sparkle as she chats with them in na'vi.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{i sweet talked mo'at into giving norm and grace a hall pass. now grace even makes me coffee before link every morning.}
<A>__{grace looks up to see neytiri approaching. it is an awkward moment between them. grace makes the formal gesture of greeting.}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(na'vi, subtitled)}
<D>__{i see you, neytiri mo'at'ite.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{i see you, doctor grace augustine.}
<A>__{another day neytiri kneels on a game trail, pointing out the tracks in the mud to jake. she touches the edges of the plants around her, and sniffs the air.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{i'm learning to read the trails, the tracks at the water hole, the tiniest scents and sounds.}
<A>__{jake and neytiri watch through a screen of leaves as a herd of huge, armored sturmbeest walks through the shallows of a lake. in the middle of the herd, the babies are sheltered from predators among their parents' legs. one of the bulls trumpets, and a flock of tetrapterons takes flight, an explosion of purple wings. jake stares at the strange and wild alien tableau. another place neytiri stands utterly still, except for her ears, which move with a life of their own. her eyes are closed. she speaks very softly to jake }
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{when you hear nothing, you will hear everything. when you see nothing, you will see everything.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{sometimes i have no idea what she's talking about.}
<A>__{jake and neytiri creep quietly, stalking a large male hexapede a six legged deer like creature. jake expertly nocks an arrow and draws his bow as neytiri watches. he takes a bead on the hexapede tracks it for a beat with the drawn bow, then relaxes his arm. zen archery.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{it's been a month and i'm still not allowed to make a kill. she says the forest hasn't given permission.}
<B>__{omiited}
<A>__{neytiri and jake crawl through the undergrowth. she points and he parts some leaves to see a mother viperwolf bringing meat to her cubs, which frisk around her legs. she licks their faces.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{there's a lot of crap like that. she's always going on about the flow of energy the spirits of the animals and what not }
<A>__{video log image human jake talks into the lens. he's changing un shaven, cheeks hollow. pale.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(smirking)}
<D>__{i just hope this treehugger shit isn't on the final.}
<A>__{visible behind him, grace is hunched over her samples.}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(without looking up)}
<D>__{this isn't just about eye hand coordination out there. you need to listen to what she says. try to see the forest through their eyes.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{excuse me this is my video log here, okay?}
<A>__{neytiri and jake move through the night forest, surrounded by galaxies of shimmering bioluminescence. they move gracefully, soundlessly two forest spirits. cu jake the pupils of his cat eyes dilated. the night forest floods his brain with its million bio sources. night shot, from overhead jake and neytiri bow fishing from a dugout canoe over huge glowing anemones at the bottom of a pool. a large fish swims silhouetted against the pastel glow. zap! jake drills it. he holds up the fish, triumphantly. another day neytiri stands close behind jake, adjusting his position as he draws his bow. only now her hands are gentle as they move on his arms, his shoulders. aware of her touch, jake's focus is broken. their eyes meet, and she pulls away quickly. night they enter a clearing filled with chest high ferns. neytiri signals him to move slowly. they approach a creature on one of the ferns. an ugly, stick like lizard thing perched on a frond. as he approaches snap! a long spine whips in a circle, unfurling a bioluminescent membrane a disk a meter across, opening like a chinese fan. it flies off, a living frisbee. the fan lizard floats across the clearing. neytiri plunges among the ferns with a sharp cry. an explosion of color as dozens of fan lizards take flight. grinning widely, she hops around like a little girl, until they are all flying. and for the first time, she is unguarded and joyful, totally herself with him. inside the link jake's eyes open in the darkness. he doesn't know where he is. he weakly pushes open the lid, blinking at the light.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{everything is backwards now. like out there is the true world, and in here is the dream.}
<A>__{tight on avatar jake silently drawing his bow, his eyes focused in intense concentration. a beat the arrow flies. jake pulls the arrow from the twitching body of a hexapede. he dispatches it with his knife. he speaks haltingly, but with feeling, in na'vi.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(na'vi)}
<D>__{i see you brother, and thank you. your spirit goes with eywa, your body stays behind to become part of the people.}
<A>__{neytiri watches with approval.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{a clean kill. you are ready.}
