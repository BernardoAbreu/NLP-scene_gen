<L>__{interior courtroom day}
<A>__{moran still on the stand. the ropes are gone now. his hands interlock across his narrow thighs.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{now your testimony was interrupted yesterday, when that power line set fire to your mother in law's farmhouse...}
<A>__{art looks really irritated.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{how is your mother in law?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{she's alright, nels, thanks for asking.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{and her farmhouse...?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{the damage was considerable. but she's insured. thanks, again.}
<A>__{see nels now. avuncular as hell. bemused by moran's annoyance.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{well, just to put it back in our minds, could you repeat what you told us. about the type of batteries you found. one carl's boat.}
<A>__{moran sighs. tries to be patient.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{one d 6 and one d 8 in the well. and a dead d 8 on the deck.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{which you inferred was replaced by the d 6, which must have been a spare.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{what else could it be?}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{even though a d 6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{which makes it a peculiar choice. for a spare.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{you said that. that was your testimony.}
<A>__{everybody laughs. including nels.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{i guess i'm a pretty smart feller, after all. and what were the type batteries you found on defendant's boat?}
<C>__{moran }
<D>__{d 6s. like i sa...}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{no further questions.}
