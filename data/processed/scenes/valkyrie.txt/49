<L>__{interior church night}
<A>__{we find ourselves in an empty church. beck is seated in a pew staring straight ahead. stauffenberg sits directly behind him. they can't risk being seen together. they speak in hushed tones. the first thing we notice is how weak and ill beck looks. he struggles to hide a persistent cough.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{out of the question. it won't work. we need you here in berlin.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{who else, then? who can even get as close?}
<A>__{beck knows there is no other choice.}
<C>__{stauffenberg }
<D>__{valkyrie is very clear. once the order is given, the reserve army will automatically seize control of the government with or without me.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{orders are not enough. they need a man to follow. the right man.}
<A>__{pause. stauffenberg knows he's right. the fucking pressure. he thinks for a moment, then with a sigh:}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{olbricht will oversee operations in my absence. i can be back in berlin three hours after hitler is }
<A>__{stauffenberg shuts up, lowering his head in prayer as a clergyman passes. once they are again alone:}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{three very crucial hours.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{we both know there's no other way.}
<A>__{beck nods, resigned.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i will tell the others }
<A>__{as if on cue, beck loses control of his cough. stauffenberg leans forward, handing him a handkerchief and putting a reassuring hand on his shoulder until the old man's hacking subsides.}
<C>__{beck }
<D>__{i'm afraid whatever the outcome, i won't be there to see it.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{nonsense. you're stronger than you think. you might just be the strongest one of all.}
