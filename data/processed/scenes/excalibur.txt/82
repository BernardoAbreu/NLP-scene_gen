<L>__{interior pavilion day}
<A>__{guenevere is surrounded by a group of ladies and maids who fuss over her dress and her hair. they eye the great knight and whisper about him, guenevere laughing with them. arthur sits, excited and happy.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{sit beside me, lancelot.}
<A>__{lancelot sits, stiff and upright.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{your deeds set an example for all other knights. for your gift, ask a gift of me.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{only give me leave to ride out again, to do what i am most able to do, and happiest doing.}
<A>__{guenevere overhears. she approaches and lancelot jumps to his feet.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<P>__{(to arthur)}
<D>__{he must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(to lancelot, smiling)}
<D>__{i grant you your wish if you grant lady guenevere hers.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{i will stay madame.}
<A>__{merlin leans close to arthur.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{the knights of galys approach the camp. it would be politic...}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{...to ride out and meet them.}
<A>__{he rises. lancelot, who was about to sit again, straightens.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i will ride with sir kay. lancelot, rest here.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{don't start a war on my wedding day!}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{without lancelot?!}
<A>__{arthur and merlin exit, leaving guenevere and lancelot. she looks at him, lively and amused, and he can't help smiling.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{look lancelot. the maids and ladies whisper about you. they all dream of winning you, young and old, fair and ugly.}
<A>__{lancelot blushes.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{but surely that's no secret to you, dear lancelot. you're the bravest and strongest knight they've ever seen, and beauty has kissed your brow.}
<A>__{he can't look at her.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{the well kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{i am a fighting man and i am married to the quest. that is enough.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{and there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{there is one.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{who?!}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{you.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{me?}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{yes. i would swear my love to you.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{to me? but why?}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{i cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my king and my friend. and, in pledging my love to you, i cannot love any other woman.}
<A>__{guenevere smiles, moved by his blunt innocence.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{i will see you in all women, and i will defend them as i would defend you.}
<A>__{he kneels, kisses her thigh, rises and leaves.}
