<A>__{as the acutes, sunburned and covered with dried brine and fish scales, are escorted down the hallway by washington, warren and doctor spivey. it's a triumphant procession as they wheel the giant flounder with a sheet over it on a gurney, holding up their catches for all to see. mcmurphy is lagging a bit behind as they pass the mess hall where workmen are busy installing a security screen over the transom, while inside the mess hall another workman is seen welding a lock on the dumbwaiter.}
