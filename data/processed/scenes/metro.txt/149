<A>__{cops keep spectators back from the building. fire trucks and rescue vehicles are on the scene. everybody looking straight up watching the wheelchair with its occupant dangling over the side of the building.}

<A>__{walter sits stock still in the wheelchair drenched with sweat, eyes closed, praying.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{dave, look at me.}
<A>__{dave obliges. he looks at mccall with eyes that have lost the battle for sanity. mccall is momentarily frozen by those eyes. beads of sweat have formed on his forehead.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{tell me what's wrong.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{particles, man. i feel them all the time. i feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{how can i help you with the particles?}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{it's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. it's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.}
<A>__{dave starts to look over into the street, he tips walter forward, walter shrieks in mortal fear. white knuckles the armrests of his wheelchair and then:}
<C>__{mccall}
<P>__{(blurting out)}
<D>__{they have less power over you if you look into my eyes.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{mccall even surprises himself with that one. it was a sheer act of desperation. he holds his breath and waits to see what the effect is. dave turns back around.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{huh?}
