<A>__{mackelway enters, spots charlton at a booth sitting opposite a woman, her back to us.}
<L>__{interior booth continuing}
<A>__{mackelway approaches. the woman doesn't turn.}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{agent mackelway. i was 'bout to introduce you, but i understand that won't be necessary.}
<A>__{mackelway doesn't get it... until the woman turns. she is agent fran kulok. 35, sharp, pretty when she allows herself to be. but with a guard that never comes down. mackelway has some history with her, so he tries not to react. it takes some effort.}
<C>__{charlton }
<D>__{seems your former office has decided we might need some help on this one. so they sent out agent kulok.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{tom.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{fran.}
<A>__{that was terse, from both of them. charlton takes note.}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{i guess we're skipping the tearful reunion. have a seat, tom.}
<A>__{mackelway sits opposite fran. she folds her hands.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{how's things back at the ranch?}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{movin' right along.}
<A>__{that might've been a dig; charlton can't tell.}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{okay. whadda we know?}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{picked up a foot print in the back seat of speck's car, size and a half bigger than speck's.}
<A>__{just like that, fran is piping up. mackelway's unoffended.}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{'kay.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{wounds on speck's throat indicate that he was strangled from behind... i think our guy waited for him in the backseat, sprung this on him once the car was moving.}
<A>__{she slides that fourth drawing to charlton giving us our first look at it. insert the drawing: ...a steamer trunk, lined with plastic. inside it are large ziploc bags. inside the bags are body parts. it's realized so accurately that it looks more like a photograph. no wonder it horrified speck so deeply. the booth resuming charlton eyes it without reaction.}
<C>__{fran }
<D>__{lab picked up talcum traces on the edges of the paper, consistent with powdered gloves.}
<P>__{(charlton nods)}
<D>__{so he gets the dropped in his lap, it spooks him, and the car winds up in the ravine.}
<A>__{plausible enough, until:}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{i don't think so, no. i think it was pushed.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{how ya figure?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{the look of the tracks. foot prints near the embankment.}
<A>__{without embellishing any further, he slides over the photographs that he took this morning with the minox: tire tracks, foot prints. she eyes them. then she eyes mackelway. charlton notes the tension.}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{okay. so our guy likes to draw pictures of body parts and then spring 'em on people. what's that get us?}
<P>__{(they're silent)}
<D>__{that's what i thought.}
<A>__{there is plenty going unsaid here between mackelway and fran. charlton has no time for it.}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{oh. 'fore i forget. this came in for you:}
<A>__{he tosses a 9 by 12 envelope at mackelway, who opens it. six sheets of paper slide out. first one we see is the top sheet of a fax: same hand written inscription as the last one: "attention, agent thomas mackelway, fbi resident agency, wichita falls." okay. this is twice now. he knows what will be under this top sheet without even looking. but here's page one: a photo of a middle aged african american woman. across the top of the photo, in hand writing: "have you seen me?" and typed on the bottom: "tanya green. age 42. ht. 5'9", wt.}
