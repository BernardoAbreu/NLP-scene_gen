<D>__{kennedy fucked us in '61, '62, and he's fuckin' us now! and that fuckin' zealot bobby kennedy is the fuckee! the nerve of that little asswipe closing the camps. took all our c 4! took ten thousand rounds, 3,000 pounds of gunpowder, all our weapons. next we'll be living in a world where only the cocksucking reds will have all the weapons and we'll be surrounded. if we want a free cuba, we gotta whack out the fucking beard.}

<C>__{cuban}
<P>__{(drunk)}

<C>__{ferrie}
<D>__{see, what kennedy done, with him you should take a knife and stab and kill the fucker where he is now. i mean it. this is true. but i tell you something. i hope i get a week's notice. i will kill. right in the fuckin' white house. somebody's got to get rid of this fucker.}

<C>__{ferrie}
<D>__{no? it won't be long, mark my words. that fucker'll get what's coming to him. and it can be blamed on castro. then the whole country'll want to invade cuba. all we got to do is get kennedy in the open.}

<A>__{oswald listens, playing with his rifle. bertrand suddenly turns cold, flashing a look at ferrie.}
<C>__{bertrand}

<D>__{you wanna know why? 'cause that mother fucker kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why! nixon was gonna be one of the great presidents 'til kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country. got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause kennedy promised 'em too damned much. revolution comin'. fascism's coming back. i tell ya this the day that communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country. i jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' oswald who didn't know shit anyway. people should know why that sumbitch was killed. 'cause he was a communist. put me on the stand, go ahead, i will tell the same goddamn story, i'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.}
<A>__{as he talks, jim shares a sickened look with bill. whatever truth he may be telling is necessarily compromised by an attitude that could be destroyed in court. garrison home night(1967) jim, lou, al, susie, and numa sit around the table having an after hours conference. the kids run in and out of the room, playing. susie is doing the talking, showing new paperwork and photos.}

<D>__{your hunch was right, boss, but it's even spookier than we thought. starting in september '63 on, two months before the assassination, there are sightings of oswald all over dallas, buying ammunition, getting a telescopic sight fixed, going to rifle ranges... early november, a dallas downtown lincoln mercury dealership where he tells the salesman albert bogard...}

<A>__{flashback to the corridor of silvia odio's apartment in dallas on a night in 1963. oswald drags behind two cubans one is "the bull", heavyset with a scar over his left eye, who we saw at the canal street incident, and the other, "the indian", is quiet and cold. the men ring the doorbell and talk to a concerned silvia as oswald hangs back, watching, in the shadows. the men give her intimate information about her father, who is imprisoned in cuba. the men chatter ad lib in spanish.}

<D>__{...the cubans want silvia, whose parents are political prisoners in cuba, to help them raise money to assassinate castro. something about the men bothers her. she tells them she doesn't want anything to do with violence... about 48 hours later one of the cubans calls her back...}

<D>__{this guy leon oswald's great, he's kinda nut... he told us we don't any guts, us cubans, cause kennedy should've been whacked after the bay of pigs, and some cubans should've done that, it's easy to do, he says you know he's a marine, an expert shooter...}
<A>__{silvia odio is surprised to hear this information volunteered. "the bull's" eyes are on "oswaldo", outside the booth with "the indian". they're hanging out, talking to a mystery man, an anglo.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{it's like he's giving her information she doesn't even ask for. she's scared, doesn't see them again till she sees oswald's picture in the paper. but the warren commission says she has bad eyesight because they have oswald in mexico at this time, trying to get back into cuba. the cubans think he's a double agent so they won't take him. the cia has a camera outside the cuban embassy and says this is oswald in mexico.}
<P>__{(hands over a picture)}

<C>__{al}
<D>__{if this is oswald, it must be our third oswald.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{the interesting thing is the extent to which the warren commission went to make him a communist. they got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match. i'm beginning to think the point of the mexican episode was to lay the blame at castro's door. if oswald, or someone purporting to be oswald, had gotten into cuba, come back, then killed the president, the american public once again would've screamed for a cuban invasion...}
<A>__{susie picks up the famous life magazine cover shot of oswald holding a rifle in his backyard.}
