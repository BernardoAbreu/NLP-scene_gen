<L>__{interior physical anthro lab day}
<A>__{margo, kawakita and frock are studying the contents of the crate.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{i can't help thinking there's something that pendergast overlooked. if the scratches were made by whatever killed beauregard, it wants something that's in here.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{a blow dart. seed pods. a plant press. pretty unimpressive stuff.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{let me see the plant press.}
<A>__{frock opens the plant press and sees a specimen inside.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{i'm not sure. as you know, the kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct. this could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui. john used it as packing material.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{you're right.}
<A>__{kawakita lifts out a bit of the fibers, as does frock.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{they're curiously fleshy.}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{and they smell delicious.}
<A>__{kawakita takes a nibble.}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{taste great.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{i wouldn't put that in your mouth until we do a chemical analysis, greg.}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{i can handle that for you while we're waiting on the g.s.e.}
<A>__{kawakita rises and exits with some of the plant.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{what about those seed pods? are they from the same plant?}
<A>__{frock takes a moment to study them, looks up.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{margo, these aren't seed pods.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{what are they?}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{they're eggs.}
