<A>__{the creature gazes through the chink in the wall, face lit up with wonder. inside, the tree is a dazzling vision of ornaments and light. the house is filled with joy and laughter. grandfather plays his recorder by a roaring fire}

<D>__{most beautiful... tree...}
<A>__{the kids go dashing across the room. the creature shifts to the slats as the door opens, throwing a spill of warm light. the children set something out in the snow. maggie calls out into the darkness:}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{merry christmas!}
<A>__{the door closes. the creature creeps from his sty, scurries closer to investigate. he finds a covered plate topped with a glittering red silk flower as decoration. the slate board is jammed in the snow. on it is chalked a child's rendering of a glowing angel and a message:}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{for the... goood spirr rit... of the... forr rest.}
<A>__{he snatches up the plate, scurries around the side of the house, and hunkers down near the tool shed with his prize. he plucks the red silk flower, enchanted by it, tucks it gingerly into an inner coat pocket. he uncovers the plate to reveal a wonderful array of christmas cookies. he's not sure what they are, but they don't smell half bad. he picks one up and bites into it. he pauses, stunned, eyes going wide as saucers. a whine builds in his throat. he starts huffing air as he chews, mouth gaping, mind thoroughly blown. screw potatoes and turnips.}
