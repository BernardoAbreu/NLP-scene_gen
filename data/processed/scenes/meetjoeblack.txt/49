<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior the carlyle hotel next day}
<A>__{a large suite, room service carts creaking with pots of coffee and half eaten pastries. the board of parrish communications is gathered, absent are parrish and quince. felicia, drew's secretary, takes notes.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{...i know you're all as uncomfor table as i am to be meeting without bill, but i got a call last night from john bontecou. not only is he still interested, he is sweetening his offer.}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{although it pains me to say it, in my opinion bill parrish dealt with us peremptorily in dismissing any deal with bontecou. therefore, i'm sorry to say that if we are to exam ine this new offer responsibly as the board of directors of parrish communications, we must do so with out its chairman.}
<P>__{(another moment)}
<D>__{oh yes, there is one additional element: bontecou is so anxious to get us, he said he'd take parrish communications with our chairman or without.}
<A>__{the board falls silent. sloane, a peer of parrish's, fidgets. drew milks the moment.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{it's no surprise if i suggest to you that the bill parrish we know is not the bill parrish you saw yesterday. you heard that speech some strange emotional rationale to buttress a knee jerk rejection of a legitimate offer. does it not strike you that something is possibly affecting this man's judgement? more specifically his judgement to make a critical business decision?}
<A>__{silence, the board clocking drew's argument.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{it's not pleasant to say the follow ing, but i would be remiss, in this crisis, if i did not. when we pre sent bill with the improved bontecou offer, and if he refuses to let us consider it once more makes an adamant or emotional rejection we will have no choice but to seek an alternative.}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{and what would that be?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow. there is a provisory by law in our charter. per the discre tion of the board, corporate off icers can be retired at age sixty five.}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{you're taking this too far, drew.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{am i not obligated to?}
<A>__{drew leans over to felicia, speaks quietly and she leaves the room.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{how did this all come about? crisis bill parrish, crisis his com pany, crisis for us. i came about with the arrival on the scene of mr. joe black. mr. joe who? joe black. he attends our board meet int, he sleeps at bill's house, re sides in his office. never leaves his side. and, in my opinion, is always in his ear. telling him what to do and bill is listening. who is joe black? what is his relationship to bill parrish? and most important, what is behind his influence on our chairman?}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{you're building this thing up too much, drew. he's had advisors be fore. nobody tells bill what to do.}
<A>__{the door opens and felicia enters followed by quince, sur prised at seeing a convened board, but still he is all smiles.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{thank you for coming.}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{hello, quince.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{hi, ed, hi folks, i didn't know everybody was going to be here, what a nice surprise. what's the big confab?}
<C>__{sloane}
<P>__{(acidly)}
<D>__{this is a secret meeting.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(to quince)}
<D>__{i hope you'll respect its nature what we're trying to do here is gather our thoughts in light of bill's rejection of bontecou's offer and make an appropriate presenta tion to him as to how we think the company might proceed. won't you share with our board the information you gave me last night?}
<A>__{quince hesitates, then realizes what drew has on his mind. he nods confidently to drew, then turns importantly to the board.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{well, i'm happy to tell you i've got good news. as i was telling drew, i've been making a little hay while the bontecou sun was shining two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{how did bill react to the leads you've developed?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{he was interested.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(prompting)}
<D>__{ but he was concerned about the timing?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{the timing yes. he says it's up to joe.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{'it's up to joe'?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{that's what he said.}
<A>__{quince, having dispensed his information, looks proudly around at the board members. they are stunned, sloane in shock. drew is absolutely still, letting quince's words sink in.}
