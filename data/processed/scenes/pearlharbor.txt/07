<L>__{interior the cockpits}
<A>__{from rafe and danny's pov, the rush is awesome. the pilots on the ground watch in awe as the p 40's get so close they can't possibly get out of each other's way. billy, the most boyish faced of the pilots, yells to drown out the sound of the collision... at the last instant, both planes snap a quarter turn so that their wings are vertical, and they shoot past each other belly to belly.}
<B>__{in the cockpits}
<A>__{rafe and danny burst out laughing.}
<B>__{the pilots on the ground}
<A>__{laugh and congratulate each other.}
<C>__{training captain}
<D>__{you know what they say... you can take the crop duster out of the country but don't put him in a p 40.}
<A>__{rafe banks to land, and danny tucks in behind him. danny has rafe's plane in his sights.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{if i had guns i'd be chewing up your }
<A>__{rafe feints left, banks right, and appears behind danny.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{if you had guns, you'd be pissin' on 'em.}
<A>__{they're almost to the landing strip, rafe behind danny. but as danny's wheels are about to touch, he guns his engine and snaps the nose of his plane straight up. the other pilots stop laughing.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{he's doing an inside loop!}
<C>__{training captain}
<D>__{aw, shit...}
<A>__{danny pulls it off, just barely making a full circle to come in behind rafe and bounce to a stop on the runway.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{yee hawww!!!}
<A>__{danny taxis his plane over to join the others. he's grinning as he slides back his cockpit cover; then }
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{where's rafe?}
<A>__{red, tall with flaming orange hair, tips his chin toward the air. seeing rafe's plane still in the air, danny starts to refasten his harness.}
<C>__{training captain}
<D>__{you're down, walker! that's an order!}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{what about him?}
<C>__{training captain}
<D>__{he's not taking my orders anymore.}
<A>__{danny's just about to ask what the hell that means, when he notices rafe climbing in a deliberate spiral.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{he's gonna do it.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{do what?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{aw, shit. aw shit shit shit...}
<A>__{rafe's plane reaches two thousand feet, just a speck above them, and seems to pause in the air.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i shouldn't'a done an inside loop. i shouldn't'a done an inside loop.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{cause now he's gonna do an outside loop.}
<C>__{training captain}
<D>__{aw shit. aw shit shit shit...}
<A>__{anthony and billy join in, like an involuntary chant }
<D>__{anthony & billy aw shit shit shit...}
<A>__{rafe, in his cockpit, is tightly controlled, yet serene. he noses the plane into a power dive. the p 40 screams toward the ground, picking up speed, going so fast it begins to shudder. the other pilots are transfixed. red is so nervous he can't get the words out.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{aw sh sh sh sh }
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you can do it, rafe. you can do it.}
<A>__{the p 40, hurtling toward the ground at nauseating speed, snaps into a half roll, streaking upside down over the runway. rafe hangs inverted in his flight harness, the asphalt of the runway shooting past, ten feet beyond his head. he pushes the plane into a climb, his cockpit on the outside of the circle. the plane reaches the top of its arc, and almost stalls; but rafe noses it over again, toward the earth, only this time he has very little altitude. the plane hurtles down, still with it belly on the inside of the curve... and makes it full circle. rafe's head now is barely a foot off the asphalt as the plane shoots past, still inverted. the other pilots burst into cheers. rafe, in his cockpit permits himself a smile. he lands, and the guys run out to meet him...all except for the training captain, who stands there shaking his head. danny jumps on the wing, as rafe stops and slides back his canopy. danny grabs him by the harness and shakes him.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you could've killed yourself, you stupid bastard!}
<A>__{he dives into the cockpit, hugging rafe.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{that was the most beautiful thing i ever saw.}
