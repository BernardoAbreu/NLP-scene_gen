<A>__{wall e alone in the center of his shelter. unwraps a bnl spongecake (think twinkie). lays it out for the cockroach to sleep in. it happily dives in. wall e collapses himself into a storable cube. backs into an empty shelf space. rocks it like a cradle... ...and shuts down for the night. outside the wind howls like the hounds of hell.}

<A>__{wall e's charge meter flashes "warning". he wakes. unboxes. groggy and lifeless. stumbles outside.}
