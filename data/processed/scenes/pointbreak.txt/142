<L>__{interior van day}
<A>__{the interior is empty except for several canvas duffel bags and a small portable vcr. it is one of the new sales presentation models, with deck and monitor together in one tiny unit.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{insurance policy. now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah. press play.}
<A>__{utah hits the button and an image comes up on the tiny screen. tight on screen. a night shot. rosie the biker has tyler in a powerful grip. her hands are cuffed behind her, and her mouth is taped. he has his switchblade up to her throat. her eyes are wild, but with rage, not fear. she's trying to struggle out of his grip, kicking at him viciously. he controls her efficiently. bodhi stops the tape.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{she's a wild one, isn't she... special agent utah?}
<A>__{utah lunges, pinning bodhi to the wall of the van... an elbow across his throat.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{you're a fucking dead man }
<C>__{bodhi}
<P>__{(gasping for breath)}
<D>__{whoa, whoa!! think it through! i'm the only one knows where they are. just let me talk for a second.}
<A>__{johnny pulls back. barely in control.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{talk.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{she'll be fine, rosie won't do anything. at least not as long as i meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...}
<P>__{(he looks at his dive rolex)}
<D>__{... six hours from now.}
<A>__{utah's voice sounds kind of strangled.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{you call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{sorry, can't do it, brah. he's on the road. and where they're going there's no phones. damn, i hate this johnny, i really do. i hate violence. see, that's why i need rosie. i could never make this thing work, myself. no way i could hold a knife to tyler's throat, man! she was my woman, once. we shared time in this world. but rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism. once you set him in motion, he won't stop. that's his gift, a kind of... blankness. noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes. nothing i can do, unless i get there.}
<A>__{utah blanches as he takes this in. knows bodhi well enough now to know he means business.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{so that makes us partners, doesn't it? because now we both have the same goal... to get me where i need to go. right?}
<A>__{utah's expression turns suddenly cold as an executioner's.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{we're wasting time.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{see! that's what i like about you, man! you're just sharp as a razor blade.}
<A>__{bodhi jumps out of the van and approaches the others, gathered nearby. he addresses the pilot first...}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{get the plane down to santa monica and top up the tanks.}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{let's go. let's saddle up!}
