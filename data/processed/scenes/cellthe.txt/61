<L>__{interior campbell center laboratory}
<A>__{as he enters, novak sees a concerned henry checking a print out of the procedure.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{must've been rather unusual.}
<A>__{noting novak's confusion, henry points to a central monitor resembling a futuristic v.u. meter, gradiated in sections of white, yellow, orange, and red.}
<C>__{henry }
<P>__{(re: white yellow area)}
<D>__{if her neural activity stays within this range, i know she's self cognitive.}
<P>__{(clarifies)}
<D>__{as if she were having a dream, but she knows she's dreaming. she can "wake up" any time she wants to...}
<A>__{as ramsey joins them, novak nods, understanding, but his eyes are on catherine, who's just coming back to consciousness.}
<C>__{henry }
<P>__{(re: orange section)}
<D>__{however, if her level of involvement is rather intense, as it was just now, she can perceive things as true. it's difficult to keep perspective.}
<A>__{as novak lingers on that question, ramsey gestures at the red section.}
<C>__{ramsey}
<D>__{what happens here?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{we don't talk about that.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{what happens?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{well, theoretically, while she's inside. if she came to believe that stargher's world is her world, her mind has the power to convince the body that anything done to it is, um, actually done.}
<A>__{novak doesn't like the sound of that.}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{that's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely. we don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please henry.}
<A>__{henry types a command and novak speaks into the intercom.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{dr. kent?}
<A>__{in the procedure room, miriam eases catherine back to consciousness.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{deep breaths.}
<A>__{when she sees stargher, catherine's flesh crawls.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{is it cold in here?}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{what happened?}
<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{miriam }
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<A>__{incapable of being in the same room as him, catherine tears out of the apparatus and anxiously exits.}
<C>__{miriam }
<D>__{catherine!}
