<A>__{the door files open and the driver sees charly. bloody. demonic. wisely leaps out, bounces from view charly snags his hat as he goes by, plops it on her head. swings up into the drivers' seat, double clutches pours on the steam. five seconds. she owns the tanker. blasts forward into the lead panel truck. slams the truck from behind, bulldozes it sends it thundering into a park bench. glass sprays. she owns the road. on the seat beside her: an mp 5 machine gun. she's set. throws a ninety degree turn onto a sidestreet. donates most of her tires to new york.}
