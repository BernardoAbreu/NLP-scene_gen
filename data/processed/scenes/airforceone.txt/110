<A>__{marshall tumbles out of the cramped galley dumbwaiter, breathing heavy. he slumps against the bulkhead and slides down to the ground. he takes a moment to pull himself together, to clear his head. he hefts the mp5, refamiliarizing himself with the weight and texture of a gun. he checks the clip. only a handfull of rounds left. he slaps it back in and switches from automatic fire to single shot then pantomimes firing.}
