<A>__{coulson stands. the grounds of the campus shakes. he grabs the truck.}
<L>__{interior security level four same}
<A>__{hill turns and looks around her, hearing a creaking noise as the building shakes.}
<L>__{interior tesseract chamber room continuous}
<A>__{the cube sparks some more, bigger each time. a beam of energy which opens into a portal. there is an explosion. a could from the beam floats to the top of the chamber. on the platform is loki, god of mischief and lies, kneeling. several guards move in slowly. tight on loki: he looks up, grinning menacingly. she stands. dolly in: fury and barton stare in shock. on selvig: he is in awe and horror. loki looks around. fury is ready to act.}
<C>__{fury}
<P>__{(to loki)}
<D>__{sir, please put down the spear!}
<A>__{loki looks at his scepter then fires a stream on blue light from it. barton pushes fury out the way. the guards open fire. loki jumps at them, firing more energy and fighting. shooting scientists and agents. barton moves towards him but loki grabs his arm.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{you have heart.}
<A>__{loki touches the tip of the spear to barton’s chest and his eyes become ice blue. he puts his gun away. loki moves to another agent and does the same as he’s done to barton. fury pulls the cube from the machine it was in and shuts it in a briefcase, then moves to leave.}
<C>__{loki}
<P>__{(to fury, turning around)}
<D>__{please don’t. i still need that.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{this doesn’t have to get any messier.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{of course it does. i’ve come too far for anything else. i am loki, of asgard. and i am burdened with glorious purpose.}
<A>__{selvig, checking the pulse of nasa scientist, hears and approaches.}
<C>__{selvig}
<D>__{loki, brother of thor?}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{we have no quarrel with your people.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{an ant has no quarrel with a boot.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{you planning to step on us?}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{i come with glad tidings, of a world made free.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{free from what?}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{freedom. freedom is life’s great lie. once you accept that, in your heart }
<A>__{loki turns and places the spear tip on selvig’s chest.}
<D>__{ you will know peace.}
<A>__{barton sees the tesseract portal cloud, brewing and moves to loki.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{yeah, you say peace. i kinda think you mean the other thing.}
<C>__{barton}
<P>__{(to loki)}
<D>__{sir, director fury is stalling. this place is about to blow and drop a hundred feet of rock on us. he means to bury us.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{like the pharaohs of old.}
<C>__{selvig}
<D>__{he’s right. the portal is collapsing in on itself. we’ve got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{well then.}
<A>__{barton quickly draws his gun and shoots fury, who drops the case. barton picks up as he, loki, selvig and another agent leave the room.}
