<L>__{interior bungalow day}
<A>__{the house is moved in. ed's unkempt dogs run about. pumped up ed sits on the bed typing fiendishly fast while wearing an angora sweater. a cigarette dangles from his mouth, and a bottle of booze lays in his lap. bela sits quietly nearby.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{how 'bout a western? people love westerns.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{but, i don't like horses. do i have to get on one?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{eh, forget it. what else is big?}
<P>__{(his face lights up)}
<D>__{teenagers! jailbait pics! yeah... you got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks }
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{who do i play?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{uh, a cop. no! you play the father. he's angry ! he doesn't like seeing his son no he doesn't like seeing his daughter behave this way!}
<C>__{bela}
<P>__{(cautious, not to offend)}
<D>__{well... can't i play the romantic part? i'm tired of always being the bad guy. you know, back in hungary, i played romeo! i would like to be the lover again me, in a boat, with the girl...}
<A>__{ed considers this.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{sure. romance, that's great! to engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures. once "glen or glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!}
<C>__{bela}
<P>__{(he smiles)}
<D>__{that's good. i could use the money.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{but we need to start off with a bang! something we know the audience will want to see. mmm. what was your biggest hit?}
<C>__{bela}
<P>__{(he thinks)}
<D>__{hmm... my biggest hit? that would probably be "dracula."}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{of course!}
<A>__{ed crabs a pen and excitedly scrawls out the word "dracula." bela frowns.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{those bastards at universal. i made so much money for them, and now i can't get the time of day.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{so let's make another "dracula." let's make "the return of dracula"!}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{we can't. those sons a bitches control the rights.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{they do? shoot. there must be a way to get around that...}
<A>__{ed's mind is working. he holds out the paper and stares at it. suddenly, he grins. he grabs the pen and makes a period after the "dr." it now says "dr.acula"}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{ha ha! dr. acula!}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{dracula?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{no! doctor acula ! you can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor! not a count.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{ah! this is very exciting.}
<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(inspired)}
<D>__{i gotta type this up, while it's still fresh!}
<A>__{ed rips the paper from his typewriter, puts in a blank page, and starts typing.}
