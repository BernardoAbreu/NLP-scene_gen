<L>__{interior police interrogation room day}
<A>__{amy sits slouched in a chair looking particularly pale. the door opens behind her. she hears a familiar voice.}
<C>__{charles }
<D>__{is this where they keep the cheaper whores?}
<A>__{amy glances up at him, without expression.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{christ, you're lucky to have a boss like me. once again, i have saved your small but relatively shapely behind.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{least you got to travel. what were they going to charge me with, anyway?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{charge you? they were thinking of shipping you to the government asylum for observation and believe me if you go in there, you don't come out. but through my mastery of international negotiations i managed to convince them that you were merely irresponsible. you got your stuff?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{slowly, feeling her bruises, amy gets up.}
