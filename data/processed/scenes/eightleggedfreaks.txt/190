<L>__{exterior town day}
<A>__{the spiders retreat from daylight. scuttling back into the buildings. heading down into the mine shafts.}
<L>__{interior various mine tunnels day}
<A>__{the chain reaction spreads through the mines. jets of flame blast up tunnels. torching any unlucky spiders looking for a home. rupturing the very earth around them.}
<L>__{exterior desert near wade's ranch day}
<A>__{the earth begins to shake violently.}

<D>__{earthquake!}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{no! it's a chain reaction! the whole valley is going to blow!}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{we'll never get out in time!}
<A>__{gladys drives up in wade's humvee. cigar in mouth.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{let's get the fuck out of here!}
<A>__{the survivors pile into the truck as the town begins to blow up in the distance. chris is just about to climb aboard when... a webline shoots out of the nearby mine shaft. consuela lives! the spider is charred and bloody. but she's primed for revenge. chris is yanked off his feet and hauled toward her. he fumbles for his machete and hacks at the webline. cutting himself free just before getting impaled on consuela's fangs. consuela knocks away chris's machete and lunges down at him. chris kicks her belly with both his feet. consuela begins to shudder. jagged cracks appear in her charred carapace. chris kicks and tears at the failing armor. he thinks he's harming the tarantula, but he's actually helping it! mike and the others watch from the humvee.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{oh no... she's molting!}
<A>__{consuela's blistered shell cracks as she shrugs the damaged skin away from her body. chris is amazed to see the spider has grown a full size larger and become totally rejuvenated! consuela comes after chris. he defends himself with the machete. shining steel makes contact with the dripping fangs. once again consuela punts away the machete. she prepares the death blow. it looks like curtains for chris.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{consuela! no! bad! bad consuela!}
<A>__{the massive spider stops in shock. chris looks back to see mike has returned.}
<B>__{tarantula pov}
<A>__{the familiar multi perspective spider vision. the tarantula seems to recognize mike.}
<B>__{back to mike}
<A>__{he throws his cassiopeia pda at the spider's face... chris uses this moment of confusion to grab his machete and drive it deep into the spider's unprotected abdomen... the tarantula screams. chris leaps up and runs, scooping up mike. they dive into the back of the humvee. consuela tries to follow but is mortally wounded. she collapses in the dust. the town explodes in the b.g. the earth itself begins to collapse.}
