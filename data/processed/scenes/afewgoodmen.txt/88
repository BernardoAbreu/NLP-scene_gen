<A>__{the remnants of the chinese food is spread around. sam and jo are sitting and taking notes from kaffee. as he speaks, he'll pace slowly around, carrying his baseball bat. he refers to the blackboard.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{this is our defense. intent: no one can prove there was poison on the raq. code red: they're common and accepted in guantanamo bay. the order:}

<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{oh, that's a relief. i was afraid i wouldn't be able to use the "liar, liar, pants on fire" defense. we can't prove coercion!! alright, fitness reports and biographical information.}
