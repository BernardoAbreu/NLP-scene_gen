<A>__{coraline, dressed in her fancy new clothes, steps onto the front porch and burps. it's always nighttime in this world. a cat meeerows. coraline looks up to see a black cat on the porch roof above her. coraline raises her brows, studies the animal a moment.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{hmmm... wybie's got a cat like you at home. not the quiet wybie; the one that talks too much. you must be the other cat.}
<A>__{the cat leaps down and lands on the railing by the basement stairs. he shakes his head and speaks!}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{no. i'm not the other anything. i'm me.}
<A>__{he tips his head to one side, opal blue eyes glinting. coraline is surprised.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{um... i can see you don't have button eyes. but if you're the same cat, how can you talk?}
<A>__{the cat shrugs from the tip of his tail to his whiskers.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i just can.}
<A>__{he leaps smoothly from the railing and onto a large,}
<B>__{fallen tree.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{cats don't talk at home.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{nope.}
<A>__{climbs up the tree's upended roots, head held high and proud.}
<C>__{cat}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{well, you're clearly the expert on these things. after all, i'm just a big fat wuss puss.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{come back. please? i... i'm sorry i called you that, i really am.}
<A>__{coraline forces herself to be polite.}
<C>__{coraline }
<D>__{how'd you get here?}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i've been coming here for a while.}
<A>__{he disappears behind one a thick root that sticks up, then reappears from a large knot hole beside coraline, startling her.}
<C>__{cat }
<D>__{it's a game we play. she...}
<P>__{(indicates house)}
<D>__{...hates cats and tries to keep me out. but she can't, of course.}
<A>__{he pokes his head down into the knot hole, then pops it up out of another knot hole, ten feet away.}
<C>__{cat }
<D>__{i come and go as i please.}
<C>__{coraline}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{the other mother hates cats?}
<C>__{cat}
<P>__{(contemptuous)}
<D>__{not like any "mother" i've ever known.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{what do you mean? she's amazing!}
<A>__{cat climbs the tree's branches onto the roof.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{you probably think this world is a dream come true. but you're wrong. the other wybie told me so.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{that's nonsense. he can't talk.}
<A>__{the cat looks at her, pitying her lack of intelligence.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{perhaps not to you. we cats, however, have far superior senses than humans and can see and smell, and }
<A>__{suddenly, the cat drops into a crouch and freezes, sensing something.}
<C>__{cat }
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{shhhh! i hear something! right ...over...}
<A>__{he scrambles across the roof and disappears around the corner. coraline shrugs, skeptical, and heads down to spink and forcible's, their door now circled with chaser lights.}
