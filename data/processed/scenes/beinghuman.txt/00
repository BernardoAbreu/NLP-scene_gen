<B>__{being human}
<A>__{hector is a family man. he and his woman and two children live near the ocean in a sheltered fold on a hillside, a shallow cave given protection at its entrance by a covering of branches and brush. just inside a small fire smoulders permanently, a few times a day encouraged into life for cooking or warmth. if it ever went out it would be a catastrophe, so it remains a smouldering com fort and a constant preoccupation for the whole family. hector doesn't know that his name is hector. it is simply a convenience to help us tell his story. the idea of individual names is an imaginative leap that has not yet been made by mankind when we first meet him. hector is living out his life 4000 years before the birth of christ, in a reasonably temperate zone of the planet. in his entire life hector will traverse no more than ten square miles of it.}
