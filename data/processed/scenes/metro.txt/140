<A>__{clarence sprints down the block... through the intersection... honk! screech! a car barely misses him. it does a one eighty on the rain slick pavement. clarence disappears into the shadows. roper arrives a beat later... streaks through the intersection... into the shadows.}

<A>__{this one is steep. clarence huffs and puffs as he labors. he shoots into a doorway. tries the door. locked. he looks back. roper is coming. relentless. he rushes across the steep street. almost slips on the reflective asphalt. roper spots him crossing and picks up the pace. he can see that clarence is faltering.}
