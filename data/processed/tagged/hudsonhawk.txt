<A>__{beneath a jawdroppingly storybook castle, a small renaissance fair with florid awnings, demented acrobats and roaring puppets is unfolding. rustic farmers and their families rumble with enjoyment at the sabbath afternoon entertainment. encircled by children, a juggler with an unforgettably etched face elegantly plucks the red balls from a pouch on his mule. as he begins to juggle, a loud explosion is heard, causing him to ungracefully drop his balls and collapse in a heap. everyone at the fair, including the puppets, looks up.}

<A>__{where the charismatic leonardo da vinci laughs down at him. da vinci wears a pair of very early, very cool sun glasses with his trademark beard. he turns and loses his smile, something extraordinary reflecting off his glasses. removing his shades, da vinci moves to the something, a gloriously incredible machine. the opening credits reveal its dazzling idio syncrasies. two coughing apprentices haplessly try to disperse smoke from the still billowing, mysteriously spectacular machine. mirrors attached to parts of it reflect beams of light which cut through the smoke like a renaissance laser show.}

<L>__{interior da vinci's workshop}
<A>__{with an accompanying blast of smoke, da vinci bursts through some double doors into his workshop, sadly reflecting upon the crystal in one hand and the tonged bar in the other. his workshop is a spendiferously enigmatic blend of laboratory and studio; on a table in the foreground is a fresh clay equestrian statue; a large volume of sketches, the inkwell nearby; a model of what looks like a helicopter; da vinci flings the tonged bar on the table among these goodies. pocketing the crystal, da vinci meanders through his work shop casually tinkering with various experiments. he snaps his fingers at a bathing suited apprentice, wearing a diving helmet prototype. the apprentice jumps into a pool of water. leonardo next stops at an easel displaying a finished except for the mouth portrait of mona lisa, who happens to be seated in a stool before the easel. she broadly smiles, revealing the worst dental work of her epoch. da vinci shakes his head and moves out onto a}

<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{tell me about it...}
<A>__{suddenly, of all things, a car is heard rumbling in the darkness. hawk and kaplan stop fighting and turn to see the may flower limousine screeching out of the darkness with darwin standing out of the sunroof firing a gun. bullets fly around them. from his back pocket, hawk slaps the nice picture of him and little eddie into kaplan's hands.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{take this to hell with you...}
<A>__{hawk jumps up and grabs a hanging lamp. deranged with confusion, kaplan turns from the picture to the charging limousine.}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{my pension.....}
<A>__{the driving alfred smiles through the windshield. kaplan's body slams into a vivid somersaulting crash into the windshield. hawk's hands burn and sizzle on the hanging lamp. passing beneath, darwin raises up his gun. hawk lets go of the lamp and drops down on darwin, locking his legs around his neck and crushing him down into....}

<A>__{hawk and darwin grapple on the floor of the limo. the da vinci helicopter model bobs on the backseat. darwin's gun goes off.. right through alfred's throat. he slumps over, pressing down on the accelerator.}

<L>__{interior backseat}
<A>__{hawk yanks his hand from the shredder and grabs the meg lomaniac by the hair and shoves his head down on the arm rest. hawk turns on the piercing siren and darwin's eyes try to escape his head with a high pitched scream. darwin's entire body bucks wildly. darwin back elbows hawk and moves down for his gun. hawk pulls him back by his hair, grabs him by the balls, and pushes him upward through the sunroof.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{god damnit, i only wanted to destroy the world in my own image. i'm a regular joe...}
<A>__{darwin pounds his fists on hawk's head as hawk hits the sunroof switch sliding it shut on darwin, pinning his arms below the roof, but leaving his torso twisting in the wind. the mural of a happy lenin with his arms outstretched looms ahead waiting to greet darwin. putting two and two together, darwin loses it....}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{not lenin, anybody but lenin. god, let's talk abut this.}
<A>__{the limousine charges through the double doors and darwin's body connects with the mural.}
<B>__{inside the limo}
<A>__{hearing the crunch, hawk flips into the front seat and brakes the vehicle. alfred's head bounces against the steering wheel. hawk reaches over with a grin and picks up the da vinci model. he looks to alfred, kaplan crunched in the windshield, and darwin's dangling legs.}

<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{we did it man, we...}
<A>__{hawk grabs alex's shoulder. alex falls back. written over his face in red lipstick is really dead. engaging a slow motion sequence, minerva saunters behind anna, putting on red lipstick. minerva slams her back to the ground. hawk howls then turns to see stiff upper lip alfred, bleeding from the neck. hawk tries to throw a punch, but alfred blocks it and crunches him across the face. the da vinci helicopter model bounces down the stairs in slow motion and cracks open, revealing the intricate mirror of the opening scene.}

<A>__{a damaged hawk awakens in a dungeonish room and stumbles to some shutters. "o solo mio" returns on the sound track as the shutters open to a postcard view of vinci. hawk closes the shutters and cuts off the music. a slightly more composed anna touches his shoulder causing him to jump slightly. they melt into a kiss.}

<A>__{alfred grandly opens double doors to reveal that da vinci's gold machine has been majestically re created piece by piece. in the periphery, the 90's rears its head in the form of three technicians wearing headsets and gun holsters who consult computer terminals.}

<D>__{gold fi ing er!}

<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{sorry, i couldn't resist. you're probably wondering why you're still alive. anna.....}
<A>__{as minerva speaks, technician one forcibly escorts anna toward a stand near the gold machine and tightly handcuffs her to it.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{i want you to monitor the da vinci's directions from the apprentice diary. and hawk, i didn't want you to go to hell without knowing that darwin and i's dream came true.}
<P>__{(suddenly sheepish)}
<D>__{beside that, none of us can seem to put that damn crystal together. alfie and i were up all night with the thing.}
<A>__{technician two commences a forcible escort of hawk to the gold machine. hawk cold cocks him to the ground.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{you killed a friend. why should i help you go for the gold?}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{it'll take a couple of years of steady production, but i will flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns. markets will crash crash. financial empires will crumble crumble.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{except yours yours. the goal of world domination. well, if you put it that way, minnie. how can i resist?}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{you can't, convict! you're just a shmoe! every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them. it rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "how could this happen to me?" it's a natural inclination. but for i, this isn't a fantasy, it is reality ! you are on my planet! you walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist! the lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to me!}
<A>__{anna looks at the oil cloth diary before her. she pulls a compact from her pocket and holds the compact mirror over the scribblings. reading off the reflection, her eyes widen.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{do it. there's no reason to fight anymore. she's a force of nature.}
<A>__{trying to get a grip on anna's words, hawk lets himself be escorted to another stand before the gold machine that has the two complex crystal parts and the weird mirror.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{if you pull this off, i can't promise i won't kill you. i mean, who we trying to kid? but i will spare the flying nun here....}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{and to think i thought you were evil incarnate in pumps.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{i killed some lovable working class italian diabetic, but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind, gentle lover. so don't play with me.}
<A>__{minerva flicks a switch on the stand anna's handcuffed to. anna vibrates, being electrocuted.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{okay, fine!}
<A>__{minerva switches it off. giving himself a head rub, hawk bears down on the three oddly malleable objects. he tangles and bends and with a loud snap, puts them together, forming the crystal from the opening scene. minerva snatches it from him and puts on a head set.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{oh hawk, don't ever change. go, team, go!}
<A>__{minerva giddily sets the crystal in the same place as da vinci had it in his machine. using a long steel pole, technician one adjusts a myriad of mirrors so they are in a proper angle with a series of lenses culminating on the top of the machine. technicians two (black eyed) and three pour various chemical powders and liquids into corresponding compart ments on the machine, beautifully decorated by the chemical's zodiac sign. alfred places a lead bar in its proper place. hawk glides to anna and undoes her handcuff.}

<C>__{minerva}
<P>__{(into the headset)}
<D>__{we're for real.}
<B>__{the machine}
<A>__{begins to rotate, at first clunkily, then faster. the crystal rotates comfortably in its compartment. the machine throws out its folding arms, each with an element. the arms click higher. the goggled technicians stand before a time coded video monitor, taking notes. the chemical housings open and the chemicals begin to spill and drop through brass tubes.}
<B>__{anna}
<A>__{murmurs to hawk.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{da vinci made the real directions in a secret script that i decoded. the way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down. isn't it wonderful?}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{wha you don't want to know...}
<A>__{hawk pulls out the mirror from his pocket.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{i wanna know...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{holy sh h things are going to get very interesting, very fast. da vinci would be proud of you.}
<B>__{in the machine}
<A>__{the chemicals snake down their individual paths to the lead bar spinning its trough. there's a flash and a controlled but jarring explosion.}
<B>__{everyone}
<A>__{doubletakes. hawk reaches down to the six foot steel pole and with one swing slams the faces of all three deep in concentration technicians to the ground. oblivious to the violence behind her, minerva, pulling on goggles over her head set, moves closer with a religious purr.}

<A>__{triggers a fresnel lens and laserlike beams bounce around the mirrors faster and faster, circling the room.}

<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{eureka, motherfuckers!}
<A>__{the machine thunders and spins at a more aggressive pace. hawk's voice suddenly comes on minerva's head set.}
<P>__{hawk's voice (head set)}
<D>__{minnie, hate to interrupt your orgasm, but....}
<B>__{hawk and anna}
<A>__{stand above the unconscious technicians. hawk is on head set.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{me, anna, and leonardo just wanna say you got the midas touch, baby...}
<B>__{machine}
<A>__{minerva turns toward the machine in anger and confusion. the center of the machine blows. the pool of molten gold rockets at the viewer. mirrors explode and the lasers slash at the walls. minerva tumbles from the machine, screaming, that is to say, trying to scream, because molten gold covers her face. it bubbles and cascades, turning her into a bizarrely beautiful echo of nefertiti.}
<B>__{hawk and anna}
<A>__{turn to retreat, and see, standing in the mouth of the open double doors, in an open shirt, wearing indian war paint on his face and the words rule britannia painted on his chest, alfred!}

<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{ooh kay...}
<A>__{alfred rushes forward with a howl. hawk meets him halfway. they trade savage punches and then lock onto each other's throats. anna pulls a gun from a technician's holster and prays for forgiveness. she aims steadily, and fires... right into hawk's arm. this allows alfred to knock him back with a strong punch.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{sorry!}
<A>__{she fires again. the bullet pings off hawk's belt buckle.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{stop helping me! thou shalt not kill!}
<A>__{hawk's turning to chastize anna, allows alfred to kick hawk back against a wall. alfred lunges out with his blade, hitting the wall off angle. hawk yanks the shaft. alfred goes with the flow and presses the shaft on hawk's throat. gasping, hawk looks to a rip in alfred's shirt and sees a hinge and lever on the shaft. with an all or nothing jerk, hawk flicks the lever. the shaft clicks on the hinge. alfred's greater strength and narrower grip makes it fold away from hawk and suddenly it is alfred's throat which is caught in the v shaped trap! the momentum of the sudden change makes alfred stumble towards the wall until the point of the "v" hits it }
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{don't lose your head over this.}

<C>__{anna}
<D>__{allow me.}
<A>__{anna confidently moves toward the dog until bunny leaps up and savagely clamps his teeth into her throat sending her crashing to the ground. hawk pauses in disbelief before raising the gun. bunny continues to viciously gnaw away on the convulsing anna, blood gently starts to emerge. hawk can't get off a shot. he throws down the gun in exasperation. it lands next to the gadget that is connected to the tennis ball machine. hawk rushes forward, picks up the gadget, turns the dial to ten, and then smiles sweetly toward the dog.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{oh bunny, ball ball.}
<A>__{bunny stops his violent behavior and perkily looks up blood droplets drizzling from his mouth. hawk slams down on the gadget. a tennis ball comes rocketing out of the machine. bunny leaps and catches the rocketing ball but the force of it sends him flying and crashing out a window. hawk pulls up anna as the machine completely explodes. a huge chunk of the roof thuds before the workshop door. hawk suddenly looks off camera and smiles. anna shakes her head vigorously. he pulls her out of the frame.}
