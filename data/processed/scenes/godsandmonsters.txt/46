<L>__{exterior harry's beachcomber night}
<A>__{betty pulls the door shut and bends over to lock it. clay catches a glimpse of skin in the side slit of her shirttail.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{let's go for a walk at least. walk and talk. i really feel like talking tonight.}
<A>__{betty's eyes blink in mock surprise.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{this old guy he's the kind of person i expected to meet when i moved out here. someone who's done things with his life.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{it's different. he's a man. and by the way you have no business calling him a homo.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{it never crossed your mind?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{he's an artist. anyway, he's too old to think about sex.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{all the old men i know think about nothing but sex.}
<A>__{she opens the door of her chevy. clay grabs it with both hands to keep her from getting in.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{c'mon. what's eating you tonight?}
<A>__{betty hesitates, then looks him sharply in the eye.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{you picked up that girl right in front of me.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{hey, no strings, right? that's what you always said. just good pals who have the hots for each other.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{it still hurt. a lot.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i didn't mean to...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{no, i'm actually kind of glad it happened. it made me wonder what the hell i was doing with my life. letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you liked it too.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{sure. i loved it.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{if you enjoy it, you should do it.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{you know, i just can't do that anymore. i still have time to get things right. get married again }
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you mean us?}
<A>__{betty bursts out laughing.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{the look on your face! you're not marriage material. you're not even boyfriend material. you're a kid. a big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i'm not a kid.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{what are you then? what will you be ten years from now? still cutting lawns? still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?}
<A>__{clay glares at her, his jaw working forward in anger.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i like my life. i'm a free man.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{sure you're free, for now at least. but how long before you're just alone? pathetic and alone.}
<A>__{clay's anger jumps from his jaw into his shoulders and arms. he grabs the door handle.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{so you don't want to fuck. that's what you're telling me?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{is that all this conversation means to you? am i going to put out or not?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{damn straight. i'm sick of playing games.}
<A>__{betty quickly gets into the car. before she can pull the door shut, clay slams it on her, hard. her hands leap in front of her face, as if he'd hit her. the look of fear in her eyes startles clay out of his rage.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{betty, look. this is coming out all wrong }
<A>__{she frantically turns the key in the ignition and the chevy pulls out.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{from here on out, boone, you're just another tired old face on the other side of the bar.}
<A>__{the car screeches away. clay stumbles across the highway.}
