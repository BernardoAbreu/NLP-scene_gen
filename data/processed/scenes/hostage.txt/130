<L>__{interior jennifer's room night}
<A>__{jennifer is anxiously waiting for kevin. when she hears someone in the hall, she thinks that it's kevin, but when the door opens it's mars. he steps inside, tall, wide, and massive as a bear. he's carrying the claw hammer. jennifer backs away }
<C>__{mars}
<D>__{kevin left without you.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about.}
<A>__{mars turns off the lights.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{don't do that. turn on the lights.}
<A>__{jennifer grows even more frightened. mars follows her across the room until she backs into the window }
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{you'd better get out of here! kevin's coming back!}
<C>__{mars}
<D>__{kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.}
<A>__{when mars reaches her, he touches the hammer to the chest, pressing to make it hurt }
<C>__{mars }
<D>__{now we can do whatever we want.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{stop it.}
<A>__{mars rakes the claws slowly between her breasts as jennifer finds the knife in her shorts. she jerks free the blade and stabs blindly burying the knife high in his chest, but mars doesn't even step back he grips the handle, moaning hideously as he pulls out the knife. a red flower blossoms from the wound. jennifer tries to get past him, but he grabs her throat and pins her to the wall }
<C>__{mars}
<D>__{you're going to enjoy this.}
<A>__{he raises the knife to her face }
