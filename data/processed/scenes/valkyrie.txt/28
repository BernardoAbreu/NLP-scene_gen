<L>__{interior stauffenberg flat dining room night}
<A>__{nina reads a story to the children in the adjoining room an idyllic scene. the sound of the phonograph is soft and constant. stauffenberg picks at a late dinner, now adept at the use of only three fingers. berthold sits across from him, deeply troubled by whatever conversation we have just missed. they speak in hushed tones.}
<C>__{berthold}
<D>__{what do you mean you quit?}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{i came to join the resistance, not some sewing circle of discarded generals and politicians.}
<C>__{berthold}
<D>__{beck is a just and capable man. as for goerdeler, well, he's popular. he'll make a good chancellor.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{like hitler before him, yes? lately i have to wonder if germany is even fit to choose her own destiny.}
<C>__{berthold}
<D>__{you can't blame the people for this. you have to see the beginning of something to know how it'll end. it's no different than a farmer watching the corn grow. one day it's over his head.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{plenty of people thought }
<C>__{berthold}
<D>__{the greatest offenders are not the ones who thought better but the ones who sensed better.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{what are you trying to say?}
<C>__{berthold}
<D>__{i seem to remember you telling me about reports from the ukraine the ss forcing jews to dig their own graves. you said then that hitler should be removed. an officer's duty, you said. what's changed?}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{i said senior officers. the only men that can get to him.}
<C>__{berthold}
<D>__{perhaps it doesn't matter that you succeed.}
<A>__{stauffenberg looks at berthold like he is crazy, but:}
<C>__{berthold }
<D>__{perhaps it only matters that you try. don't you see? someone has to stand up and show the world that not all of us were like him.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{even if they could remove hitler, they can't hope to seize power. for god's sake, they have no plan.}
<C>__{berthold}
<D>__{then give them one. find a way.}
<A>__{he puts a hand on stauffenberg's arm.}
<C>__{berthold }
<D>__{evil happens when good men do nothing.}
<A>__{before stauffenberg can answer, new music comes blasting from the phonograph o.s. the unmistakable sound of wagner's ride of the valkyries.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{children, that is far too }
<A>__{he is cut off by the appearance of his four children, all wearing cloaks made of bed sheets, pots for helmets and brandishing makeshift swords. they charge into the room, singing loudly and attacking their father. he does his best to defend himself with one hand. their commotion causes the phonograph to skip. and you'd think that's where it ends. we even pull back, creating that effect. it takes a moment to notice the wailing sound we're suddenly hearing is not on the phonograph. nina hears it first, then stauffenberg and berthold. finally the children freeze and the phonograph skips without their help. the glasses on the table rattle. now we hear the wailing quite clearly. a siren.}
<C>__{stauffenberg }
<D>__{air raid.}
<A>__{the adults herd the children out of the room. muffled concussions cause the phonograph to skip frequently, turning wagner's masterpiece into a stutter.}
