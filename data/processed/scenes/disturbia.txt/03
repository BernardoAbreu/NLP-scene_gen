<L>__{exterior bishop lake day}
<A>__{the undisturbed beauty of nature serves as our backdrop as we move closer to kale and jeff, taking note of their t shirts: jeff's has a silkscreened cartoon rendition of a bass wearing aviator goggles with mounted missiles on its fins. beneath it, the slogan: "weapons of bass destruction." the fish on kale's shirt wears a stock car uniform, a single word across the bottom: basscar. as jeff steadies kale's hand and pulls away:}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{you don't want to scare him off. you've got his attention, now just play with him. tease him a little.}
<A>__{kale and jeff watch the water in anxious silence... kale inching the line back toward the boat. one more crank, then the black bass suddenly attacks the lure with a tremendous slosh of his tail!}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{holy shit!}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{it's all you, kale, keep cranking!}
<A>__{kale cranks fast and furious. but this is one fish that's going down fighting.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{i need reinforcements!}
<A>__{jeff moves in, grabs the rod and reel from behind kale.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{heave, laddie!}
<A>__{they pull. the rod curls under the weight.}
<C>__{jeff }
<P>__{(pirate accent)}
<D>__{give it all ya got, mate, or you're gonna lose him!}
<C>__{kale}
<P>__{(laughing; pulling; struggling)}
<D>__{dad, your pirate impersonation sucks!!}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{how would ya know, have ya ever met one? i doubt it }
<A>__{the bass sloshes furiously around the bait, now just a few feet from the boat!}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{he's freakin' pulling us in!}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{never! no brecht has ever lost a fight to a fish!}
<A>__{the bass suddenly snaps free. the line goes limp. jeff and kale lose their balance, nearly falling backward. then all becomes silent save for jeff and kale's heavy breathing. kale winds the empty line back to the boat, shoots a glance to jeff, then throws the rod aside in mock disgust. jeff takes a seat in the captain's chair.}
<C>__{jeff }
<D>__{throw me a }
<A>__{kale is already in the cooler. he throws jeff a coke. both sit in silence for a beat. then }
<C>__{jeff }
<D>__{hey, at least the weather's great... we're spending quality time together.}
<C>__{kale}
<P>__{(grabbing pole)}
<D>__{that fish is going down.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(not missing a beat)}
<D>__{let's nab the bastard.}
<A>__{they both cast their lines }
