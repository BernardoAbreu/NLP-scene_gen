<L>__{exterior chavez ravine day}
<A>__{park the powerhawk. downwind. out. walking. check my hamilton: 12:10 pm.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{noonan's deadline lapsed ten minutes ago. an official fugitive from justice now.}
<A>__{down below, bradley with reuben ruiz in tow: glazed fear, following him like he's handcuffed. protestors gather, placards hoisted, chants: "dodgers, no! mexico, si!" the group gathers steam, supporters pack in, the chorus continues: "dodgers no! mexico si!'}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{bradley doing damage control, the forced relocation of the ravine's immigrants has the press in a feeding frenzy. reuben ruiz forced along as the token mexican mouthpiece.}
<A>__{reporters press. bradley handles them with ease and aplomb.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{ this area has long been rife with crime and venality, but with a brand new stadium, we can make this horrible blight a bright spot and give our los angeles dodgers the home they deserve.}
<P>__{(like ruiz was an orphan)}
<D>__{reuben ruiz can tell you of his travails growing up in this horrible slum and why now is the time to `redeem the ravine.' reporter #2 chief bradley, u.s. attorney noonan has promised to deliver surprise witnesses before the federal grand jury on }
<A>__{ bradley, this brilliant rebuke:}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{ welles noonan is an unscrupulous hack politician whose smear campaign against us will fail, for he has grievously underestimated the moral rectitude of the los angeles police department.}
<A>__{then bradley sees me. his press friendly face contorts, the shift startling: if only a flashbulb could've framed it. he shifts back from snarl to smile...}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{now if you'll excuse me, i will leave you with reuben ruiz.}
<A>__{ruiz begins his forced coerced do it or we'll fuck you sob story as bradley steps away from the glare. i follow. get right on his heels.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{your subpoena hasn't caught up to me yet, chief...}
<A>__{bradley spins back.}
<C>__{me }
<P>__{(hand him junior's file)}
<D>__{hurwitz holdings.}
<A>__{bradley blanches, buckles. i see it. before he can play stupid with: `what?'}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{you, bethune, and gallaudet bought big chunks of chavez ravine over the past two years through a shell company called hurwitz holdings.}
<P>__{(beat, look around)}
<D>__{if the dodgers move here the value of the land booms...you could sell it off for a fortune or hang onto it and make even more. the parking lots alone would make you all multi millionaires.}
<A>__{bradley removes his glasses, staring at documentation that dooms both his immediate and distant future...}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{word gets out that the three city officials who were pushing hardest for a stadium also stood to gain a mint might color public opinion. might color it even more to know that the lapd's chief of detectives was trying to purchase a huge tract of that land from the biggest dope dealer in town.}
<A>__{slap another file over the one he's reading.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{hector magdalena owned ten and half acres of this land.}
<P>__{(beat, ram him)}
<D>__{you didn't give a shit about solving his disappearance. you were worried that your real estate deal was going south.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{that's why you wanted tommy found, not because he was a murder suspect or you were concerned that noonan might tap him as a federal witness...you needed him to finalize your fucking land grab. to sign paperwork in place of his dead dad. that's why you've got madge and lucille in custody now.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{maybe i will let your subpoena find me now chief, maybe i will walk right into it...the tales i could tell.}
<A>__{all bradley can muster is:}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{junior stemmons. the ex evidence teacher. his `excellent ratings' didn't stop him from stealing the magdalena seizure and doing his own investigation.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{why would he investigate me?}
<A>__{hand him noonan's business card: dig the big federal eagle in american blue.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{that was stapled to the cover.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why would noonan worry about a turd like me now...when a high profile target like you can be taken down.}
<A>__{silence. i smile wide at it. bradley, scrambling.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{where is stemmons?}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{no idea. if you haven't spoken to internal affairs today, i'm sure they've called. junior's apartment caught fire. deeply deviant material inside. round him up }
<P>__{(my angle)}
<D>__{ and anyone he's got with him.}
<A>__{bradley readjusts his glasses.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{i will issue an a.p.b. saying stemmons is a known deviant targeting kindergarten children.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{now, quid pro quo...you subpoenaed wilhite too.}
<A>__{bradley's reaction: feature the angler getting angled.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{how do y }
<C>__{me}
<D>__{ don't worry `how.' why?}
<A>__{bradley says nothing. then, like a klieg light, it hits me.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{you're going after narco yourself.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{exposing the corrupt parts of the lapd will redeem the whole. i will prove that police can police themselves }
<C>__{me}
<D>__{ so you show up noonan...co opt his crusade and condemn your own before he can...jesus christ can you turn lemons to lemonade.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{no cop will testify against other cops. this is why wilhite has suddenly disappeared.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{and how.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so where do we go now chief?}
<C>__{bradley}
<P>__{(beat, eyes flick again to the files i'm holding...)}
<D>__{there are other forces at work here...faces we need to identify. names we need to know. a third party.}
<C>__{bradley }
<D>__{find out who klein and i will reinstate you, rescind that subpoena & burn the coroner's report on sanderline }
<C>__{me}
<D>__{ that report is only useful to noonan now.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{no. it ensures our mutual destruction should you choose to share the contents of that stemmons file. which i know you won't do until you figure out how it will best benefit you.}
<A>__{he walks off, imperious, impervious, gets engulfed by the press ranks once again.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{a mistake to underestimate me now chief. the price to keep your secrets is steep...and you're going to pay up. soon.}
<A>__{back to the powerhawk, fresh scrubbed six packs standing near it, the trunk stink ripe past the point of concealment. they see me, deferential nods. one squeaky wheel offers:}
<D>__{six pack something in your trunk smells to high hell lieutenant.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{dead body.}
<A>__{laughter. easily amused academy types. brush by grinning, give `em an "enforcer" story to tell the other rookies. i jump in the powerhawk and tear off.}
<D>__{me (v.o.) (cont'd) borrowed time burning fast. my days are done. only hours remain. whatever moves i have left...make them now.}
