<A>__{a group of bandits is dividing up the loot, as jen rides up, keeping a respectable distance. they notice her and rise as she dismounts. one of them saunters over to her and stands, grinning, a few feet away. in a second, she's slammed his balls into his stomach and knocked his nose into his face. he crumples to the sand. the other bandits stop laughing, quickly exchange glances, and charge her at once. in a matter of seconds, they're either on the ground or dragging their fallen comrades back. lo calls out and stops the fight.}
