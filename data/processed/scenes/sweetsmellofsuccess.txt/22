<B>__{hunsecker}
<A>__{from sidney's viewpointerior hunsecker is seated at a table which is cleverly his habitual position. we see him only in semi back view, a broad and powerful back. he is listening to a man who has paused at his table, stooping over hunsecker to whisper in his ear. as the columnist listens, his hands play with an omni present pad and pencil which lie on the dinner table amongst an assortment of envelopes, mimeographed sheets and a telephone. beyond hunsecker and the man talking to him are the senator, the agent, and an attractive, if fatuous girl.}

<D>__{harvey, i often wish i were dead and wore a hearing aid...with a simple flick of a switch i could shut out the greedy murmur of little men...}

<D>__{forgive me, harvey. we were interrupted before }
<A>__{in foreground, sidney turns to the captain with a carved smile, indicating that hunsecker's change of topic is to be interpreted as sanction for sidney to remain. the captain, not entirely convinced, retreats. sidney finds himself a chair, places it and takes a seat which is near enough to the table to establish his presence. during this:}

<D>__{awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "sidney, i got a nasty little problem here." did i say no? i'm frank to admit it don't jell as fast as we like... but all of a sudden i can't get you on the phone no more! why?... and why, as of this date, am i frozen out of the column...}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(scornfully)}
<D>__{are you finished?}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{no, lemme finish. i don't like this job! that boy is dumb only on matinee days otherwise he's got a head. and susan, like you said, she's growing up. two heads. what i mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(incisively)}
<D>__{not "we", sidney, you!}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(gamely)}
<D>__{correct me if i'm wrong we! because when i'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(sardonically)}
<D>__{ha! my right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!}
<A>__{sidney quickly moves into j.j.'s path, desperate to hold his attention.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i will do it, j.j. don't get me wrong in for a penny, in for a pound. i will see it through, but stop beating me around the head. let me make a living!}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(his mouth tight and mean)}
<D>__{what you promised do it! don't finagle around. it's later than you think.}
<A>__{hunsecker walks past sidney, now making for the car at which the attendant still waits.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(as hunsecker passes him)}
<D>__{excuse it, but it's later than you think. that boy proposed tonight.}
<B>__{hunsecker}
<A>__{hunsecker is hit: he stops in his stride; he pauses and he turns slowly to look at sidney. lowering, he hesitates, mind clicking...}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{susie told you that...?}
<A>__{reverse angle favoring sidney sidney, his eyes bright, nods. hunsecker studies sidney, then:}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{no wonder you've been so 'feisty' tonight.}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{can you deliver?}
<A>__{sidney nods.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{tonight. before you go to bed. the cat is in the bag and the bag is in the river.}
<B>__{hunsecker}
<A>__{expressionless, he examines sidney. then he walks off toward the car. he tips the attendant, who thanks him, but instead of getting into the back of the car, he makes a small authoritative gesture to nikko (double) to move over so that hunsecker himself may drive. while nikko does so, hunsecker turns back to sidney, whom the camera now includes.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{don't be a two time loser, sidalee. the sentence could be severe...}
<B>__{sidney}
<A>__{he is satisfied.}
<B>__{hunsecker}
<A>__{hunsecker gets into the driver's seat beside nikko, the japanese houseboy. camera is close on hunsecker who does not look back but is clearly aware of the position of sidney as he puts the car into gear, revving the engine... sidney night the big car accelerates with impressive power. in doing so, it sends a cloud of fumes and a swirl of dust in sidney's direction. he leaps out of the way, too late. camera moves closer to him as, with anger and ignominy he inspects his precious clothing for damage. but, as he looks after the car, his face hardens into grim humor; he senses that this petty gesture from hunsecker is an indication of his vulnerability, not his strength. as, dusting his coat, sidney walks away, camera rises, watching his jaunty figure cross the street in the direction of 51st street.}
