<C>__{sir ivy}
<D>__{beanie!}
<A>__{some of the girls start at the sound of ivy's big barry white baritone. they rise, groggy, burping up last night's debauchery. mascara smeared, hangover hindered the girls rise as bernard "beanie" alfonse, protector #2, pops in; a sumo sized brother with a diamond studded smile.}
<C>__{beanie}
<P>__{(addressing the girls)}
<D>__{alright ya'll, that's the call, we had our fun, pack it in, pro ceed to the front. les' go, les' go }
