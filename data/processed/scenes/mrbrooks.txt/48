<A>__{honk!! honk!! mr. smith looks around. he's not sure that sound was for him. but when the toyota honks again and flashes it's lights, mr. smith waves and splashes to the center of the street. even though he stops to let it pass, a car sounds its horn and swerves to avoid him. mr. smith crosses behind the toyota and opens the passenger door.}

<D>__{we drive around until we see someone we think we might enjoy killing.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{really? that's it? i thought you might already have someone in mind.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i don't enjoy this, mr. smith. i do it because i'm addicted to it. and before you entered my life i had vowed i would never kill again. so this is your party, you can chose anyone you want and we'll do it together.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{can it be someone i know?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{you never kill someone you know. that's the easiest way to get caught.}
