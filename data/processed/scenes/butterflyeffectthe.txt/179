<L>__{interior evan's dorm day 2002}
<A>__{evan comes to back in his dorm, the same posters are on the wall, the sheets are the same. even the familiar sounds of thumper having sex under the covers.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i thought i told you two to beat it.}
<A>__{evan's face falls as he hears a familiar voice, but not thumper's.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{what? hey, sorry, man. we wake you up?}
<A>__{evan is confused by lenny's presence, but smiles to himself and shakes his head "no".}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{no, it's cool.}
<P>__{(re: lenny's okay)}
<D>__{really cool.}
<A>__{evan yawns, bringing his hand to his mouth, but there's no hand. no arm, really, either. just two fleshy stumps! evan bolts upright in bed and stares down at his amputations.}
