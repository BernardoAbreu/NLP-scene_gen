<D>__{i'm listening.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{the epa is going to make a stink about power lines. the white house is pushing them to do a big study.}

<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{but thank you, son i'm glad you chose to share it with me. we do make quite a team, don't we?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{i i hope it wasn't my press conference that started this.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{no, this is a stunt for the polls.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{so do you think there's something in it for us?}
<C>__{dodge}
<P>__{(musing)}
<D>__{if we got the epa off olaf andersen's back, he'd be extremely appreciative.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{and how do we do that?}
<C>__{dodge}

<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{and you're going to ?}
<A>__{tommy makes a squeezing gesture, grins.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{oh, no, not at all just... persuasion. strenuous persuasion.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{that's allowed?}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{persuasion, yes. intimidation, no. but it's a gray area. who's to say which is which?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{dick, wait a minute shouldn't we check out the tip? make sure the epa's really going through with this investigation?}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{of course.}
<P>__{(looks at watch)}
