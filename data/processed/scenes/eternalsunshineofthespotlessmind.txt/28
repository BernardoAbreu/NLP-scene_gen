<L>__{interior joel's apartment night}
<A>__{joel lies on his back in fresh pajamas. his eyes are closed and electrodes connect his head to several machines. the machines are operated by stan, now in grubby street clothes and in need of a shave, and by patrick, dressed similarly. the monitor on one of the machines traces a myriad of light blips running like streams through an image of joel's brain. stan presses buttons and operates a joystick, aiming for the lines. patrick (who we saw earlier with clementine at the bookstore) studies a meter on one of the machines.}

<D>__{the voltage looks fine.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{then check the connections.}
<A>__{patrick fiddles with some jacks.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{does that help?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{yeah, that looks better. thanks.}
