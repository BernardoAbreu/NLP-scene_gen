<A>__{roberta pours nervous energy into her cappuccino, adding cinnamon, chocolate, and sugar, stirring loudly. dan sits across from her, observing.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i just don't see how i'm gonna do this. it's huge. it's gigantic! it's carnegie hall! and listen to this: now isaac stern wants to play with us diane monroe, michael tree there's other people calling }
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{that's fantastic!}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{fantastic? i will never get the kids up to speed in time, i will never get myself up to speed. i'm gonna be playing side by side with the world's greatest violinists.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{and "the world's greatest violinists" are playing side by side with you because they want to help you win this fight.}
<A>__{he offers her a forkful of some decadent looking chocolate cake, but she shakes her head.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{yes, but... you don't understand. maybe there's a good reason why i never made it as a violinist maybe i just can't cut it. i keep blaming it on not having enough early training, but if i were talented, if i had a gift }
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{but you do have a gift. you're gonna put thirty east harlem kids on stage at carnegie hall not because they're prodigies, but because you got them to stick with something that's hard as hell and to strive for excellence which, by the way, i certainly wasn't striving for when i was their age. not to mention the other ten years' worth of students whose lives were changed because of you. that's your talent, roberta.}
<A>__{she takes this in, looks at him gratefully and puts her hand over his. he strokes her hand.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i'm scared.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i know.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and by the way, i happen to think you're a pretty good violinist too.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{you've barely heard me play.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i've heard enough to know you're gonna do just fine.}
<A>__{roberta looks at him with trepidation. dan takes another forkful of his cake.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{besides, no one's gonna be paying attention to your playing anyway.}
<A>__{roberta laughs. dan smiles, glad he got her to lighten up.}
