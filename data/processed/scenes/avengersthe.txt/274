<L>__{interior trubshaw's dawn}
<A>__{on jermyn street, snow lies waist high. blaring sirens. searchlights. pa announcements urge citizens to stay indoors ... pull back to reveal a fire glows, a clock ticks calmly. emma sits with her shoe, surrounded by a pile of shoes. steed & trubshaw beside her.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{this time the shoe's on the other foot. you said a hand made shoe was as good as a photo fit or d.n.a.? well, all we have to do is find the shoe that fits ...}
<C>__{trubshaw}
<D>__{it should be easy. a trubshaw client has his shoes delivered personally. the ministry should be able to confirm our delivery.}

<D>__{i will be back ...}
<C>__{emma}

<C>__{steed}
<D>__{laying in supplies, mrs. peel weather may get very nasty and i've no umbrella ...}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{you needn't bother. i can't drag you further into this. after all, i am still the chief suspect.}

<D>__{no bother. mother and father think i've joined you. i might as well.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{but }
<C>__{steed}
<P>__{(comes back)}
<D>__{oh, and by the way, i think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{if you'd been through what i have, you wouldn't }
<A>__{steed reaches and pulls off the micro bug from her shoulder.}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{a microtag. one of mother's little toys. there you are. free at last.}
<A>__{he tips his bowler off her surprised reaction.}
