<L>__{interior hold santa lucia night}
<A>__{whittlesley ducks between cages of goats, boxes of farm equipment, his movements jerky with panic. as he continues searching, the camera moves past him, into the darkness of the hold. we hear whittlesley mumbling between low, ragged breaths. at the back of the boat the camera finds... a stack of crates... clearly labeled natural history museum. move in on these as... the crates vibrate. the boat has started to move! whittlesley stands bolt upright, realizing what's going on.}

<D>__{no!}
<A>__{too late. he turns to run back on deck but then stops, sniffs the air. a look of desperation fills his eyes. with one hand he pulls out the knife, and unexpectedly puts it to his own neck. better to kill himself than face what comes nexterior the knife touches... a necklace of two arrows, one gold, another silver. whittlesley stares wide eyed into the blackness of the hold. the goats start bleating in blind panic. a shaft of moonlight comes through a porthole as the boat turns. the moonlight falls on the crates. whittlesley's eyes lock onto them and he inches towards them, drawn inexorably closer... closer...}
<C>__{whittlesley}
<D>__{no... no...}
<A>__{he begins mumbling a prayer. move in on his eyes... filled with dread as he falls to his knees, staring, always staring at the crates...}
