<L>__{int trailer cezar kelso day}
<C>__{cezar}
<D>__{i picked you out to pitch it to first, but don't think you're the only action in town and i'm giving it away. 'cause i'm not.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{widen to include neil who doesn't say anything. cezar kelso's a large crippled man in a wheelchair.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{cezar}
<D>__{a bank. on thursdays it gets cash deposits for distribution to other branches. the branches have to buttress their cash accounts to handle friday payroll checks from a toyota and nissan plant, a steel mill and two refineries. one day a week, thursday, the main branch carries the full whack.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{you want a $100,000 advance, against a full 101. why?}
<C>__{cezar}
<D>__{'cause i can get it. 'cause this is the best thing i seen in three years. 'cause a screw up makes 10 percent of nothin' equal nothin'. and 'cause those are the terms and they ain't negotiable.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{on the prowl or strong?}
<C>__{cezar}
<D>__{strong. through the front door. during the day.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{how many guys?}
<C>__{cezar}
<D>__{four. three plus a driver.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{that's not a $100,000 worth anything. you're giving me an address to what's strictly a cowboy score: "get the guns and let's go!" we smash, grab and boogie while they hit the alarm.}
<C>__{cezar}
<D>__{three alarms. and that's why the price. 'cause you chop in through the roof the night before on the prowl and bypass 'em. i got circuit diagrams, blue prints, the works. so yeah, they hit the alarms, but nothing gonna happen.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{do i have to kill people?}
<C>__{cezar}
<D>__{i doubt it. two men have the two keys to open the box.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{full architectural, plumbing and electric, camera placements?}
<C>__{cezar}
<D>__{all of it.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{what do you estimate?}
<C>__{cezar}
<D>__{eight point, one. eight point, two million dollars.}
<A>__{that gives neil pause. kelso gets satisfaction from neil's reaction to the amount. then:}
<C>__{cezar}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{where's nate?}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{he hadda make a call.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you're on.}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{here's five grand earnest money. you get the rest after lunch.}
<A>__{they shake hands.}
