<L>__{interior craig family home later}
<A>__{craig sits at the table, dialing someone, anyone. ally enters, drops her keys on the counter. her father doesn't look at her as she pours herself a coffee.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{...i'm sorry. i fell asleep...}
<A>__{craig squeezes honey into his coffee, practically strangling the bear. not looking at her. ally notices the red notebook on the kitchen table next to the phone.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{you turned your phone off.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{i forgot to charge it.}
<A>__{it dawns on her...}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{that's mine. from my desk.}
<A>__{craig says nothing. just stirs his coffee. ally is furious.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{how could you?}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{you were gone all night. i was trying to get some information.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{how could you go through my stuff like i'm a suspect?}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{then stop acting like one.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{what is the matter with you, dad? you have no respect for me and the way i'm feeling, my privacy. we talked about this! you're totally paranoid...}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{you watch your mouth!}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{you don't do anything. you don't go anywhere except work. you have no life.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{my life is right here! in this house. the same place as yours. but you're spitting all over it.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{jesus christ, dad! i went on a date!}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{i smell alcohol...}
<A>__{right back at him.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{so do i.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{dad...}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{this is my house!}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{you wanna bury me in it?}
<A>__{crack! he hits her, hard, open hand, from across the width of his body. ally is knocked off balance and hits her head on the cabinets.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{ally!}
<A>__{his face is contorted with panic and shame. ally's disoriented. her ears are ringing. her lip is split. a knot is starting to form where she hit her head. she straightens herself up and stares at her dad like she has no idea who he is. beat. craig tries to envelop her. with a guttural snarl she pushes him away, getting a little bit of blood on his shirt. she scrambles up the stairs.}
