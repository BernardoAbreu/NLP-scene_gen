<D>__{stop squabbling or we're gonna crash.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior space later}
<A>__{megatron and the other dented, dinged and dead decepticon bodies float through space. we follow the wailing megatron and the others down to:}
<B>__{the surface of unicron}
<A>__{littering the otherwise beautiful technological expanse.}
<C>__{unicron}
<D>__{welcome, megatron.}
<C>__{megatron}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{who said that?}
<C>__{unicron}
<D>__{i am unicron.}
<C>__{megatron}
<D>__{show yourself!}
<C>__{unicron}
<D>__{i have summoned you here for a purpose.}
<C>__{megatron}
<D>__{nobody summons megatron!}
<C>__{unicron}
<D>__{then it pleases me to be the first.}
<C>__{megatron}
<D>__{state your business.}
<C>__{unicron}
<D>__{bring me the autobot matrix. it is the one thing the only thing that can stand in my way.}
<C>__{megatron}
<D>__{you have nothing to fear. i have already crushed optimus prime with my bare hands.}
<C>__{unicron}
<D>__{you exaggerate.}
<C>__{megatron}
<D>__{the point is, he is dead! and the matrix died with him.}
<C>__{unicron}
<D>__{no. it has been passed to their new leader. get it for me.}
<C>__{megatron}
<D>__{why should i? what's in it for me?}
<C>__{unicron}
<D>__{your bargaining posture is highly dubious, but very well, i will provide you with a new body, and new troops to command.}
<C>__{megatron}
<D>__{and...}
<C>__{unicron}
<D>__{and nothing.}
<A>__{you belong to me now.}
<C>__{megatron}
<D>__{i belong to nobody.}
<C>__{unicron}
<D>__{perhaps i misjudged you. proceed on your way to oblivion. the mist appears and starts to dissolve megatron.}
<C>__{megatron}
<P>__{(pleading)}
<D>__{no, no. i accept your terms. i accept!}
<C>__{unicron}
<D>__{excellent! behold galvatron! x ray images: wiring, circuitry, etc. flash on and off as a new and larger being starts to form, changing from dented megatron to a huge, new creation: galvatron.}
<A>__{the transformation creation ends in a blinding flash and galvatron who still resembles megatron laughs and flexes his muscles and stretches. his voice is deeper, different from megatron's}
<C>__{galvatron}
<D>__{long live galvatron!}
<C>__{unicron}
<D>__{and these shall be your minions...}

<C>__{scourge}
<D>__{scourge (sweep character) is bearded, fanged and ferocious looking and as soon as he has been created, he roars and stretches and an array of similar creatures smaller and all wearing dark and matching uniforms are instantly created from others behind him}

<D>__{scourge, the tracker....and his huntsmen...the sweeps....}
<A>__{on cyclonus (new decepticon with plane transform ability) cyclonus is created and then his "armada" of similar, but smaller and similarly colored and clad creatures are formed.}

<B>__{angle featuring galvatron}
<C>__{galvatron}
<D>__{to cybertron!}
<A>__{he roars with a mad power rush, gets into cyclonus (who will be his personal ship) and leading the armada, takes off for the distant stars.}
<C>__{unicron}
<P>__{(loudly proclaiming over the scene)}
<D>__{bring me the autobot matrix! during unicron's command we change angle to show}
<B>__{long shot of unicron}
