<L>__{exterior city street day}
<A>__{at the same time, a few blocks away, an old, frail man is carrying two plastic grocery bags that are too heavy for him. walking behind this man is a younger man named catch lambert, an attractive man with some scarring on his face. his eyes, deep down, are haunted by something, but there is energy in his step. he is dressed in a relaxed and stylish manner, not expensive. he begins to pick up his pace to catch up to the old man. people glance at catch, nad he glances back in an open and unflinching way, ready for anything, a smile, a nod, or because these are some of l.a.'s mean streets a threatening or taunting look. these he also meets openly, without a trace of fear. the man has been through some kind of fire, and it has left him different from us. outside the usual boundaries. catch walks beside the old man, glancing at him. finally, the man glances back, wondering and suspicious, but catch has a slight, disarming smile, open and honest.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{y'know... since we're both walking the same way, i could take one of those bags for you. that way, i do some upper body work while i'm walking along. helps my back. what d'you say?}
<A>__{the old man trudges on, proud and suspicious, too.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{right now your mind's making pictures of me robbing your groceires, but, y'know, nine times out of ten, people do the right thing.}
<A>__{the old man glances at him, still not convinced, but he soon has to stop and rest. catch stops, too. the old man looks at him, a bit embarrassed.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{it's the dog food that makes it so heavy.}
<A>__{catch nods, puts out his hand. the old man hesitates, then decides and lifts a bag, and catch takes it.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i guess it's worth it... for a good dog.}
<A>__{catch isn't kidding. he has that honesty. the old man nods and starts trudging again. as they walk on together, catch reaches for that second bag. the man relents and lets him take it. they continue on, catch carrying the bags and every now and then lifting them a bit for his upper body work.}
