<A>__{the armored vehicle roars backward up the ramp. slams into a mass of conduit. tears free. ripley works the shifters, pivoting the massive machine. everybody's shouting, trying to put out the fire. pandemonium.}

<A>__{something lands on the roof with a metallic clang. gorman has plastered himself against a wall, as far from the door as possible. a latch lever behind his head turns. the small hatch against which he was leaning is ripped away and something snatches him out the opening he disappears to the waist with a shriek, legs kicking. the alien clings to the roof, pulling him out. its tail whips over, scorpionlike, and buries a four inch stinger in gorman's shoulder. hicks grabs a joy stick at the fire control console and turns it rapidly. on the roof the alien looks up as servo motors whir. a remote control turret cannon, a 20mm chain gun, swivels toward it in a curt arc. voom. the creature is blasted off the vehicle's armored back and tumbles away. gorman, slumped unconscious, is dragged back inside. the apc rips away a section of catwalk and heads for clear air, its flank trailing fire like a comet. ripley fights the controls as the big machine slews, broadsiding a control room out building. office furniture and splintered wall sections are strewn in the apc's wake. suddenly, an alien arm arcs down, right in front of ripley's face. it smashes the windshield. glistening, hideous jaws lunge inside... ripley recoils. face to face once again with the same mind numbing horror. she reacts instinctively. slams both sets of brakes with all her strength. the huge wheels lock. the creature flips off, landing in the headlights. ripley hits full throttle. the apc roars forward, smashing over the abomination. its skeletal body is crushed under the massive wheels. it rolls, tumbling...lost in the darkness behind as the machine thunders onto the causeway and away from the station. a sound like bolts dropped in a meat grinder is coming from the apc's rear end. hicks eases ripley's hand back on the throttle lever. her grip is white knuckled.}
