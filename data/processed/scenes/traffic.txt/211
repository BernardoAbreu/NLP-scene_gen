<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{francisco steps from the car and mingles in with other people walking along the sidewalk. he follows them for few yards, picking his moment. he closes the distance to gordon, castro and ruiz, pulling a pistol from inside his jacket. he takes careful aim from twelve feet away and is about to shoot ruiz when a bullet hole appears in his chest. he staggers, trying to squeeze the trigger, francisco fires the gun once, wildly a tourist screams gordon and castro and ruiz turn francisco is looking down at the widening red splotch in the center of his shirt, uncertain of what has happened gordon shoves ruiz down into a doorway and fires three quick shots francisco spins around and drops on his face in the street. citizens run in all directions fearing a psychopath with an nra card coming off a bad week of day trading gordon and castro with ruiz beneath them scan the streets.}
