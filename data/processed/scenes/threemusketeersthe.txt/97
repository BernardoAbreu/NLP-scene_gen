<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior forest day}
<A>__{athos leads d'artagnan through the forest. sunbeams shoot down through thick branches like golden bars. a pastoral setting, almost peaceful. and then: thundering hoofbeats. athos and d'artagnan turn in surprise, see six horsemen crashing through the glade.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{athos and d'artagnan gallop through the dense forest. the horesmen fire pistols as they ride. a shot grazes d'artagnan's shoulder, he staggers, retains his mount. athos leads them up a hillside, a series of boulders at the top. the climb is fast and treacherous, gunfire all around them. athos' horse is struck by a bullet, staggers forward... and collapses just as they reach the crest. d'artagnan leaps off his horse, takes cover with athos behind the boulders. athos takes aim, fires a shot, and kills one of the horsemen below. the others curse, leap from their mounts, seek cover. shots whiz back and forth like angry hornets. stalemate, but not for long. they are badly outnumbered. the horsemen creep slowly up the hillside, from tree to tree. athos turns to d'artagnan as he reloads:}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{i will hold them off for as long as i can. go on without me.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i can't leave you here. not like this.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{ride to calais and stop the cardinal's agent.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{athos... i can't.}
<A>__{athos points his pistol at d'artagnan.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{go, or i will kill you myself.}
<A>__{a few days ago, d'artagnan would have obeyed without question. fearful, if nothing else. but not here, not now.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{a duel then.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{you're insane.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{we never finished the first.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{all right. i will toss a coin. tails i stay, heads you remain. agreed?}
<A>__{d'artagnan nods. athos fires off another shot. he produces a gold coin, flips, slams it between palm and hand. and looks between.}
<B>__{athos and his pov}
<A>__{heads. d'artagnan is to remain. athos looks up without missing a beat.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{tails. i stay.}
<A>__{athos returns the coin to his doublet without giving d'artagnan a chance to see.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{but...?}
<A>__{athos reloads, fires below. d'artagnan recognizes the kindness he has received. that athos cannot fully express it. and that there is no use arguing with him.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{at least take my pistol.}
<A>__{he gives it to athos. they clasp hands.}
<C>__{athos}
<P>__{(gruff; yet proud)}
<D>__{don't let us down... musketeer.}
<A>__{there are tears in d'artagnan's eyes. he knows athos hasn't got a chance.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(a choke of emotion)}
<D>__{i will never forget you.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{go!}
<A>__{athos turns away, shoots at another horseman. d'artagnan runs to his mount, gallops away. d'artagnan he rides, straining to hear the sounds of gunfire. as long as the shots continue, he knows athos is alive. abruptly... the shots cease. d'artagnan swallows his heart, and rides.}
