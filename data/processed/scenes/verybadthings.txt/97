<L>__{interior law firm}
<A>__{tight on barry morris, mid 40's, attorney.}
<C>__{barry morris}
<D>__{i don't see how this could have been kept from you. the facts are quite simple; last month adam and lois changed their will. they requested that you two, as a married couple, be the custodians of record for their estate including all properties, cash holdings, security holdings and... children. you are legal custodians of the brenn trust.}
<B>__{angle on}
<A>__{liz and fisher, flanked by adam jr. and timmy, eyes wide, they sit across from the attorney, totally bazooka'd. they stare in horror at morris.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{my god.}
<C>__{barry morris}
<D>__{there's more.}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{more?}
<C>__{barry morris}
<D>__{adam and lois were not terribly prudent in terms of providing for the possibility of the unforeseen.}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{barry morris}
<D>__{i'm talking about life insurance. i'm talking about money.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{money?}
<C>__{barry morris}
<D>__{yes money. adam had a five hundred thousand dollar term life insurance policy.}
<B>__{pause.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{that means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{barry morris}
<D>__{actually, no. adam was switching to a whole life policy, but re scheduled his medical exam... and failed to make his last payment... so his term life lapsed. so it's value is null and void.}
<P>__{(off liz's horror)}
<D>__{now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{well, oh...}
<C>__{barry morris}
<D>__{and a house. valued at 350 thousand.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{so where's that leave us?}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{150 plus 350... we still get 500 thousand.}
<C>__{barry morris}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no. not even close. with property values down, the house is worth 100,000 less than 450 he paid for it. with three credit cards, the minivan payments, and other outstanding debts... plus the income and estate taxes assessed on his ira...}
<P>__{(punches his calculator)}
<D>__{you'll get, oh... in the neighborhood of, ah... 14,223 dollars.}
<A>__{adam jr. suddenly slips off his chair, lands flat on his back, starts struggling to get up. fisher tries to help little adam up.}
<C>__{little adam}
<D>__{get away from me!}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{i'm just trying to help...}
<C>__{little adam}
<D>__{i don't want your help!}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{stop kicking. stop kicking!}
<A>__{fisher manages to get adam jr. back up in his chair. liz looks rather horrified.}
<C>__{barry morris}
<P>__{(breaking the tension)}
<D>__{so. when is the wedding.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{tomorrow}
<P>__{(at fisher)}
<D>__{we are getting married tomorrow.}
