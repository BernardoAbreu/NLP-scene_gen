<A>__{we see gorgeous george lying on the floor with a head the size of a water melon. there is blood streaming out of every orifice in his head he's in.big trouble. we are in slow motion; there's a lot of activity going on around the body on the floor, their mouths are open but we can't hear what they are saying, all we can hear is the voice over given by tommy.}

<D>__{this isn't good, if george doesn't wake up in the next few minutes i tommy ( v . o . ) (cont'd) have a problem. i am scared, really fuckin scared. there is something coldblooded and practical about what these people are thinking. they will pop me like a hot sausage if george doesn't wake up. why do they want to go to the trouble of explaining why a man died in a campsite? these people don't exist in society, you can't find them, they live under their own laws and ignore everybody else's. i am scared, i am really fuckin scared.}
