<L>__{interior mike's house day}
<A>__{mike is in the kitchen; he's making eggs in agitation, throwing in everything he can find (tuna fish, chopped pickles, mustard), his kid, tommy, in evidence in the b.g., on a skateboard, whizzing through the kitchen, even riding it down the stairs. mike moves to a cabinet and his feet go out from under him. he's slipped on a skateboard barely catching himself in time.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{tommy! goddamnit! get these skateboards off the goddamn kitchen floor!}
<A>__{tommy whizzes through, expertly picking it up "on the move," mike taking a futile swipe at him.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{what're we having?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{my special, scrambled eggs surprise.}
<C>__{tommy}
<P>__{(frowns dubiously)}
<D>__{scrambled eggs surprise?}
<A>__{tommy goes whizzing on out again. ellie comes in loaded up with the groceries. puts them down, giving mike a kiss.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{so how'd it go?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{not great. i've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.}
<A>__{it explains his mood. ellie starts putting away the groceries.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{for how long?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{'til they pick up the perp.}
<P>__{(he sits)}
<D>__{seniority gets day shift... you know what that means.}
<A>__{close on ellie: she sits, realizing, upset, but taking it in stride, now putting plates on the table.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{well, i will live with it, i've lived with it all my life. my dad was a cop, he said, "whatever you do, honey, never go out with a cop". so, what did i do? i got a job with the cops. then i married a cop. i probably gave birth to a cop.}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{tommy! come over here and eat, it's hot.}
<A>__{tommy enters.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{maybe you and tommy should stay with my mom.}
<A>__{ellie makes an expression of dislike.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{don't start... the only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...}
<P>__{(realizing that tommy is listening)}
<D>__{... crummy. i just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{i can still use a gun.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{just keep it someplace safe, but handy.}
<A>__{tommy joins then at the table.}
<C>__{tommy}
<P>__{(zooming in)}
<D>__{keep what handy?}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{the gun? it's in the upstairs closet.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{how do you know where the gun is?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{i know where everything is.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere! i'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{lay back, mack.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{lay back, mack!! what's this "lay back, mack?"}
<P>__{(to ellie)}
<D>__{where does he get this?}
<A>__{silence; they eat... ellie's eyes finding mike's.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{keep the weekends for us, huh? get a replacement for saturday nights. that'll give us the weekends together.}
<A>__{tommy's face screws up, tasting the lump of food in his mouth.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{god! scrambled eggs surprise?! these are pickles...! god!}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{just "lay back, mack"... lay back...}
