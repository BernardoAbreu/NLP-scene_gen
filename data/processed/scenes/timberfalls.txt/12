<A>__{a black four door vw passat cruises the interstate. a gortex duffel is strapped to the roof. i e. passat (moving) day mike warren, late 20s, with a devilish grin and looks to kill, sits at the wheel. even a flashy pair of sunglasses can't mask the twinkle in his eye. sheryl james, late 20s, rides shotgun. this beauty's got it all: toned bod, sharp mind and a heart stopping smile. an opened bag of chips sit in her lap. a couple of diet cokes in the cup holders. she cradles a cellphone mp3 player.}

<D>__{i listen to crap?}
<C>__{mike}
