<L>__{exterior sidelines afternoon}
<A>__{a handful of red faced fathers are yelling at each other. they're in each other's rain soaked faces. the scene feels on the verge of physical violence. david and another security guard jog over. david steps in the middle of the tight circle. the men stop yelling in the presence of stadium security. everyone just stands in the rain glaring at each other. beat.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you know what i think about to calm down? i think about those big fat, hundred and twenty pound turtles that live in the islands. those suckers never get angry, never get in fights and live longer than all of us and all they do all is sit on the beach and hump other turtles.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why don't we take a second and think about the turtles?}
<A>__{nobody moves. rain washes over the agitated faces. a father breaks the moment.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{yeah jerry why don't you think about the fat ass turtles... like your fat ass son on the field jeopardizing the rest of our chances at a fucking championship.}
<A>__{david tenses. everyone looks to jerry. a bald man who stands just a foot away. jerry nods to himself. looks like he's going to say something. instead he lunges forward and smashes a headbutt to the man who spoke to him. david tackles jerry hard and fast. he drives him into the ground. blood starts rushing out of the nose of the dazed father who took the headbutt. the other fathers start yelling and pushing each other. the remaining security guard calls on his walkie for assistance. david keeps jerry immobilized in a powerful arm and head lock that holds the man's enraged face hard into the wet surface of the field. david's eyes are not on jerry. they gaze out onto the field where twenty two elementary school boys have stopped playing and are standing frozen, helmets off, rain washing over their faces. they watch in horror as their parents attack each other on the sidelines.}
