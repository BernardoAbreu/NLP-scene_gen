<T>__{on cassidy:}
<A>__{cassidy can't take any more. she turns and walks.}
<T>__{on randy:}
<A>__{randy plants a foot on the bottom rope. he looks toward cassidy. randy's pov: he catches a glimpse of cassidy disappearing through the curtain into the locker room. randy looks out on the crowd. chanting, cheering. he starts to climb. standing on the top rope, he looks again at the curtain. she's gone.}
<T>__{hallway:}
<A>__{cassidy exits the arena sobbing.}
<T>__{the ring:}
<A>__{the ayatollah lies on the ground in pain.}
