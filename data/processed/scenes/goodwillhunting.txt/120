<D>__{oh shit.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{guy's tryin' to walk the line but he can't even fuckin' stand up, and so my uncle's gonna spend a night in jail. just then there's this fuckin' boom like fifty yards down the road. some guy's car hit a tree.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{some other guy?}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{yeah, he was probably drunker than my uncle, who fuckin' knows? so the cop goes "stay here" and he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. so, my uncle marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. so he goes, "fuck it." he gets in his car and drives home.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{holy shit.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{so in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the statie. so my uncle's like, "is there a problem?" and the statie's like "i pulled you over and you took off." and my uncle's like "i never seen you before in my life, i been home all night with my kids." and statie's like "let me get in your garage!" so he's like "all right, fine." he takes around the garage and opens the door and the statie's cruiser is in my uncle's garage.}
<C>__{all}
<D>__{no way! you're kiddin'!}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{no, he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home. fuckin' lights and everything!}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{did your uncle get arrested?}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{the fuckin' trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. the fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.}
<A>__{everyone is laughing. skylar speaks above the din.}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{there was this irish guy, walking down the beach one day.}
<A>__{she has everyone's attention. will is nervous.}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{and he comes across a bottle, and this genie pops out. the genie turns to the irishman and says "you've released me from my prison, so i will grant you three wishes." the irish guy thinks for a minute and says "what i really want is a pint of guiness that never empties." and poof! a bottle appears. he slams it down, and lo and behold it fills back up again.}
<A>__{c u of will. hoping the joke pans out.}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{well, the irish guy can't believe it. he drinks it again, and again boom! it fills back up. so, while the irish guy is marveling at his good fortune, the genie is getting impatient, because it's hot and he wants to get on with his freedom. he says "let's go, you have two more wishes." the irish guy slams his drink again, it fills back up, he's still amazed. the genie can't take it anymore. he says "buddy, i'm boiling out here. what are your other two wishes?"}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the irish guy looks at his drink, looks at the genie and says... "i guess i will have two more of these."}
<A>__{the gang erupts with laughter.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{it's a good thing no one's irish here.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{i'm irish.}
<A>__{chuckie, will look at morgan, baffled.}
