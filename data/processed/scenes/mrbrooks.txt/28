<L>__{interior hallway brooks box factory n day}
<A>__{mr. brooks comes around the corner. he's raving at marshall who's walking beside him.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{you see all of this?! the factory, the houses, the cars, the money, the respect!!...}
<A>__{a different angle in the same hallway shows mr. brooks walking away from us. a passing employee crosses him. the men nod to each other. marshall is nowhere in sight.}
<C>__{mr. brooks }
<D>__{... i like them! i don't want to lose them!}
<A>__{and then we're back to the original angle and marshall is again in the picture.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{... that's why i didn't want to do the dance couple!}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{stop your fucking whining, earl, you enjoyed doing that couple just as much as i did, and look on the bright side, he came to us he didn't go to the cops. if he tries to shake us down we kill him. period. we make it fun but we kill him. end of story.}
