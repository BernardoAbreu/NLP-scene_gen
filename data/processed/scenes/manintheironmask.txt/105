<L>__{interior palace king's room day}
<A>__{as louis' tailors outfit him in a dazzling gold peacock costume, complete with a jeweled mask at the end of a wand, he amuses himself by looking out the window at the beautiful young women arriving early for the ball.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{it shall be interesting tonight.}
<A>__{d'artagnan enters, looking concerned.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{your majesty. this ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of paris we have no way of checking }
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you will protect me as you always have, d'artagnan.}
<A>__{through the window louis sees more beautiful young women.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{by the way, claude inform mademoiselle beaufort that she will be moving from her rooms }
<A>__{he looks up to see that michelle has entered through the open door behind him.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{never mind, it seems we have already told her.}
<A>__{but michelle's appearance brings him up short. it is not the cruel brush off; she is already harshly different: her eyes are red from crying, her lips are tight in anger.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{murderer! murderer!}
<A>__{she holds a letter, crushed in her hand.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{i wrote fromberge! under your seal! i wrote as you, demanding to know why he disregarded my order to keep raoul from danger! he writes back: "but your majesty! your last letter ordered me to put him in front of the cannon!"}
<A>__{she hurls the crumpled letter into his face. everyone is frozen, silent. she staggers toward louis as if to attack him, then falls to her knees, weeping. no one helps her... except d'artagnan. he kneels, hugs her shoulders, helps her to her feet, and guides her toward her room. but d'artagnan looks back once, toward louis.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{hysterical woman.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{sire, misuse of the royal seal !}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{she'll be gone tomorrow.}
<A>__{as d'artagnan and michelle move out, they pass anne, coming in. anne and d'artagnan exchange a look; he remembers to give her a respectful nod, but she moves past, into the king's dressing room. louis is surprised.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{mother ?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{may i speak with you? alone?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i am preparing for a ball!}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{we haven't visited in three years. and we should have privacy.}
<A>__{exasperated, louis waves his attendants away.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what is it, mother?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i wish to discuss your brother.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{he is dead! by god's choice! there is nothing to discuss.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{first they told me he had died at birth. then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret. but the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i am king, mother! and i do not wish to discuss this with you.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{he was my blood and i demand to know what happened to him.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{why would you ask now? you never asked before!}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{because i have dreamed of him. not as the baby they took away, but as a man.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you have prayed too much. your mind is weak.}
<A>__{avoiding her stare, louis lifts a plaster bust of his father, its eyes like the sightless pupils of greek gods.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i believe in dreams, louis. they are our souls speaking to us, from that world beyond our eyes. and that son i never saw in daylight was standing in the moonlight of my dreams. and he wore an iron mask.}
<A>__{we see her from a low angle, from a pov behind louis and we see the plaster bust burst upon the marble floor.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{it it doesn't matter, mother! he is dead now! dead!}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{yes. dead. two nights ago. the night of my dream.}
<A>__{and the night of louis' "dream." anne begins to walk out.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{if... if he was wearing an iron mask in your dream, then how could you know he was your son?}
<A>__{louis smiles; he thinks he has her.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{then you did do it, louis. you did put your brother in an iron mask.}
<A>__{all the blood is gone from louis' face. anne walks from the room, past louis' waiting tailors. he snaps at them.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i have a ball to attend!}
<A>__{they rush in. as they scurry about, dressing him in gold, louis' composure returns; he stares at himself in the golden mirror, likes what he sees... and smiles.}
