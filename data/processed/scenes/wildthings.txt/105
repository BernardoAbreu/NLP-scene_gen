<L>__{exterior mall entrance late afternoon}
<A>__{sam exxts a building, a large package of wrapped goods beneath his arm. he looks toward the parking lot where barbara baxter stands beside the red mercedes. she tips a valet then starts toward the mall. she sees san. their eyes meet. a moment of hesitation, as neither is quite sure what to say.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you look pretty.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{sam smiles. she points to the stuff beneath his arm.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{quite a shopping spree...}
<A>__{she's kidding, then seems to consider how sam might take it.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{i didn't mean...}
<A>__{sam laughs it off.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hey, i've got it, i may as well spend it, right? i've always wanted to live where i could dive for my dinner.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{and where might that be?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i was thinking, antigua, maybe.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i love antigua.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{maybe i will come visit you.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'd like that.}
<A>__{a moment, she touches his face. sam raises a hand to cover hers, as... ... in b.g., a black range rover just the roof visible above the tops of the other cars, cruises the lot.}
