<A>__{the place is a mess. chairs broken, tables overturned. music blares on the jukebox. and empty except bud... three sheets to the wind, drunk. pacing the ruins with his 9mm in hand...}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{y'all fuck with me? huh? you want to fuck with me?}
<A>__{cobb and marandino peer in the doorway to see bud, shouting and threatening a vacant chair.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{jesus christ.}
<A>__{bud flips another table. continues talking to the chair as if someone were in it.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{'look at me when i talk to you.}
<P>__{(aims his 9mm)}
<D>__{you try and kill me? you like killin' women and kids?}
<A>__{bud holsters his gun and beats the shit out of the chair.}
<C>__{cobb o.s.}
<D>__{bud...}
<A>__{bud spins, glass eyed and red faced. his wavering vision can barely make out cobb and marandino approaching...}
<C>__{marandino}
<D>__{easy, bud... easy...}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{we got you here, bud... it's just us. hear me?}
<A>__{bud stands his ground, tries to keep his balance...}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{let's go home...}
<A>__{there's a long moment. bud stares at his crew, gone. then he's suddenly overwhelmed with emotion...}
