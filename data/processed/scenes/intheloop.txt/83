<L>__{interior karen's office's office day}
<A>__{(change scene order) later. general miller is with karen. they're surrounded by cartons of chinese take out.}
<C>__{general miller}
<P>__{(flicking through liza's paper)}
<D>__{see, this is the problem with civilians wanting to go to war. when you've been there you don't want to go back unless you absolutely have to. it's like france.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(re the paper in it's red folder)}
<D>__{you finally read liza's paper?}
<C>__{general miller}
<D>__{course, i read it. i'm a voracious reader. i'm the fucking gore vidal of the pentagon.}
<P>__{(pointing at a spring roll)}
<D>__{you don't want that?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{yes i want that.}
<P>__{(points to various packages)}
<D>__{i want that, that, that, that and that. those i don't care about. and these let's pack up and drop on north korea.}
<C>__{general miller}
<P>__{(beat, reads)}
<D>__{someone should leak this.}
<A>__{outside liza sees them discussing her paper animatedly. it doesn't look good to her.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{someone maybe shaped a little bit like you.}
<C>__{general miller}
<D>__{me? are you kidding?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you have more gravitas.}
<C>__{general miller}
<D>__{exactly. i'm too senior. i can't leak. leaking is for people like your liza and the boy called it out there.}
<P>__{(eats)}
<D>__{it's insane. not only is the case against war incredibly strong, the case for is caveated to hell.}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"most analysts believe the state is looking to expand aggressively beyond its borders..." then here in the caveats, the only source is `ice man' a possible alcoholic who's probably called that cos he gets through ten bags icebergs a day in his fucking vodka tonics. inr say we can't trust him. that's us disputing our own findings. has linton read this?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm not sure he reads. you're a general. have him killed.}
<C>__{general miller}
<D>__{you see this is why we never got together. that and the hobo teeth.}
