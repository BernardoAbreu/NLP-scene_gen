<L>__{interior hospital room morning}
<A>__{daybreak. sunlight streams in, soft suffusion, the color of good scotch. primo sparazza, 86, lies on a hospital bed, an o2 mask shrouding deep set, sunken eyes, cataract grey, gazing out at a four walled world. someone enters the room, awaiting approval to approach...sparazza, turning, seeing the man, summoning him over with a feeble finger wag. the man reaches him, kneeling down, ring kissing reverent, whispering:}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{...he's here now...}
<A>__{sparazza nods. the man exits. after a moment, the door opens again...and another man enters, walking slowly toward sparazza's bedside. he sets down his luggage, a black leather valise. the travel tags originate in stockholm: the swede has arrived.}
