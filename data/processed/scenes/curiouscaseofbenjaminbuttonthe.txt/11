<D>__{even teddy roosevelt had come.}
<A>__{and we see the distinctive figure of theodore roosevelt, in overcoat and hat, the war heavy on his shoulders. we watch mr. cake, with the aid of an assistant, climbing the scaffolding to his clock covered by a velvet drape... he stands for a moment... and with a simple tug, releases the purple swath... people gasp at the magnificent clock... "mr. cake" winds the clock, which chimes a glorious chime... pushed by an angel, the second hand begins its eternal journey...going around... everyone cheers... until they realize the clock is going the wrong way... traveling backwards in time... a man shouts, "it's running backwards!"}
<C>__{monsieur gateau}
