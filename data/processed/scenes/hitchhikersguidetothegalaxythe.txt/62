<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior humma's quarters continuous}
<A>__{humma's quarters are opulent. he sits behind his desk flanked by several armed body guards. ford, arthur and trillian keep a safe distance as zaphod faces off with humma who has the air of a cool news anchor man.}
<C>__{humma kavula}
<D>__{zaphod beeblebrox, our famous president. the arkleseizure has exhaled many blessings upon you. what brings you to our humble planet?}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{i think you know why i'm here.}
<C>__{humma kavula}
<D>__{i don't think i do.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{oh, i think you think you don't, but we both know you do.}
<C>__{humma kavula}
<D>__{elequent as always, zaphod. your ability to communicate a clear thought never ceases to amaze.}
<A>__{head 2 suddenly springs up to the surprise of all.}
<C>__{zaphod head 2}
<D>__{you called me stupid!}
<C>__{humka kavula}
<P>__{(re: the heads)}
<D>__{interesting. and i don't know what you're talking about.}
<C>__{zaphod head 2}
<D>__{during the campaign, humma you said i was stupid.}
<C>__{humma kavula}
<D>__{this humma you speak of no longer exists. he came here in his consolation position as ambassador to gamma z10 to squelch an ideological threat to the system and repented from his wicked ways. he now goes by the holy name tazelo the unceasingly righteous, given to him by his devoted followers.}
<C>__{zaphod head 2}
<D>__{i don't care what you call yourself, you righteous freak!! you started the rumor that i'm stupid and you're gonna pay!!!}
<A>__{the 3rd arm reaches for a gun in zaphod's vest. the body guards aim their weapons. one runs up and smacks zaphod in the back of the head slamming head 2 back in place.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{the 3rd arm disappears. the gun falls. a body guard picks it up. with arthur, ford and trillian}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{why do i get the feeling he's going to get us all killed?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{probably because it's very possible. just don't save me, okay? we're even.}
<A>__{humma lays his palms on the table and lifts himself as if to stand but there is nothing of him below the table line except for thirty, one inch metal legs, attached to the base of his torso. he glides towards zaphod, the little legs extending to reach the floor as he reaches the end of the table.}
<C>__{humma kavula}
<D>__{the election is ancient history, zaphod, but if memory serves you won, proving that good looks and charm win over brilliance and ability to govern.}
<A>__{a guard drapes a white robes over humma's shoulders which he ties with a belt hiding his peculiar undercarriage.}
<C>__{humma kavula }
<D>__{and incidently you are stupid.}
<A>__{his head jerks up. zaphod stops it, paints on a smile.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{that's really not the pointerior}
<C>__{humma kavula}
<D>__{you haven't come halfway across the galaxy to settle a campaign grudge. why are you here, zaphod?}
<A>__{zaphod doesn't answer. humma motions to a guard who grabs his arm, twists it hard.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<P>__{(wincing)}
<D>__{i don't know. i was headed for magrathea, i ended up here.}
<A>__{push in on humma who raises his hi tech sun glasses.}
<C>__{humma kavula}
<D>__{how very, very...}
<P>__{(knowingly)}
<D>__{...improbable.}
<A>__{he pulls the nose off his body guard, turns a key. a secret safe door slides open from the mans' chest.}
<C>__{humma kavula }
<D>__{i kept a few souvenirs from my former life. ah, the heady days of space piracy... so young, so foolish..,}
<A>__{another, smaller box rises from the chest cabinet. inside we see glowing jewels, a skeleton hand, etc. humma removes a pink cube (like zaphod's blue cube.)}
<C>__{humma kavula }
<D>__{i will gladly give you the coordinates to magrathea...}
<A>__{he holds up the pink cube revealing a series of coordinate numbers on each side. zaphod reaches for it. humma takes it back...}
<C>__{humma kavula }
<D>__{...provided you bring me something in return.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{humma kavula}
<D>__{a gun.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{a gun?}
<C>__{humma kavula}
<D>__{a very special gun. designed by the greatest computer ever invented, now buried in the bowels of magrathea.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{fine. i will get your gun. just give me the coordinates.}
<A>__{zaphod reaches out. humma pulls it back.}
<C>__{humma kavula}
<D>__{and what will you give me to insure your return?}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{my word as president.}
<C>__{humma kavula}
<D>__{ha! i'd be better off with the dung of a bethusian mega donkey.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{okay, then i will get you that.}
<C>__{humma kavula}
<D>__{i need a hostage, something you hold dear. only what does zaphod beeblebrox treasure?}
<A>__{on zaphod's second head peeping out of the collar looking terrified. humma smiles. bingo. he signals the guards. they grab zaphod who looks back to trillian, offers a weak smile.}
