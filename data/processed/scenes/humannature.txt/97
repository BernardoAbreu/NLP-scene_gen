<L>__{interior nathan's apartment night}
<A>__{the table is elegantly set, candlelit. lila sits at it while nathan fusses in the kitchenette. something classical wafts over from the stereo in the living room. nathan places a salad in front of lila and sits across from her with his own salad.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{it looks wonderful.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{you look wonderful. i'm on top of the world tonight, lila. work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...}
<A>__{lila picks up a fork from the inside of her setting, not the outside. nathan blinks. lila tastes the salad.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{um mmm. oh nathan, this salad is delish...}
<C>__{nathan}
<P>__{(clenched teeth)}
<D>__{my god! the fork! the fork!}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i'm sorry?}
<C>__{nathan}
<P>__{(strangely)}
<D>__{tell her, harold...}
<P>__{(stops himself)}
<D>__{it's just that... it's nothing. it's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. one goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry.}
<P>__{(picks up correct fork)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, nathan. i never really learned those things.}
<C>__{nathan}
<P>__{(forced casual)}
<D>__{no biggie.}
<A>__{there is a long silence as they both eat the salad.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{boy, this is good!}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{i'm sorry that i became so upset.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{no, i'm sorry. i'm really backward in certain areas.}
<C>__{nathan}
<P>__{(beat, blurting)}
<D>__{it's only that i really enjoy your company and...}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{you do?}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{yes, and...}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{you really enjoy my company?}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(beat, blurting)}
<D>__{please don't talk with food in your mouth, lila. please. you're so pretty and it only mars your... i'm sorry. i'm being critical.}
<A>__{nathan pounds his forehead with his fist. lila waves her hand to indicate that it's fine. she doesn't say anything because she's chewing.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{it's just that i have some peculiarities, and...}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i like you, too, nathan.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{you do?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{yeah}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but i have some peculiarities also.}
<C>__{nathan}
<P>__{(happily)}
<D>__{i don't care. i don't care!}
<P>__{(then, concerned)}
<D>__{like what, for example?}
<A>__{lila takes a deep breath, about to go into it, thinks better of it.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{like nothing.}
<A>__{nathan smiles, relieved. lila smiles back. nathan recoils slightly, skittishly half points to his bared teeth. apparently there's a piece of food stuck in lila's teeth. she closes her mouth, runs her tongue over her teeth, smiles again, mouth closed.}
