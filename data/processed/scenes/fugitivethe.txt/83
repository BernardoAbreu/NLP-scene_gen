<A>__{roars... just above the treetops. helicopter speeds up a dark river. its tracking beam illuminates the river bank.}
<L>__{exterior rural roads night}
<A>__{flashing lights. two highway patrol cars set up roadblocks. the squawk of police radios breaks the rural quiet. a moment later a helicopter roars overhead.}
<L>__{exterior tracks night}
<A>__{kimble moves down train tracks. his jumpsuit is wet with blood from the gash. he pauses and checks the wound. he's going to need stitches. far down the tracks he sees glow of town lights. he keeps moving.}
<L>__{exterior trestle dawn}
<A>__{kimble crosses a tressel, keeps running toward the direction of the lights. a junk yard by railroad tracks and a road. signs along the road show we're on the edge of town. one says: hospital 1 2 mile. angle tracks and stream kimble runs from a streak up to the railroad tracks. as he nears the junk yard and road he sees the hospital sign. he's close but he can't go into the hospital in his prison jumpsuit. he leans against a wrecked car and catches his breath. just then a tow truck pulling a car on its hook, turns off the road and parks next to the tracks. kimble ducks for cover behind the wrecked car. the driver climbs out, dumps his coveralls in the front seat and closes the door. he moves toward a house across the tracks, then forgets something and returns to the cab. he throws open the door and grabs lunch box off the seat and we notice the coveralls missing from the seat. as the driver returns to the house we move to the opposite side of the car to find kimble, ducked beneath the window, clutching the coveralls.}
