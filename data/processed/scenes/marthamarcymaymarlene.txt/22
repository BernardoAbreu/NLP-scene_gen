<L>__{exterior farm field day}
<A>__{the sound is the same as the lake: a light breeze in the trees and the water gently hitting the dock. patrick and two men build a fence.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{martha lies in the open field smoking cigarettes with zoe, a girl in her early twenties. martha is younger, more energetic and confident. they are laughing and talking when zoe notices patrick walking towards them.}

<C>__{martha}
<D>__{great. you've got a really nice place here.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{it's as much yours as it is mine.}
