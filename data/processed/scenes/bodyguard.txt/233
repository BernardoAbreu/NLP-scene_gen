<L>__{interior clermont hotel (iowa city) night}
<A>__{it is a rotary dinner. the camera tracks along the front of the head table which runs from one side of the room to the other.}
<C>__{rotary president }
<D>__{our speaker this evening, the honorable congressman from the fifth district, galen windsor, has been a lone, courageous, voice... he alone has challenged those who have linked organized crime with legitimate business throughout our state.}
<A>__{still tracking, we see the rotary president as he nods to a distinguished looking gentleman one seat to his right. on the wall a sign identifying the hotel and a club banner which reads "the rotary club of iowa city." the camera continues to track and the rotary president goes out of frame.}
<C>__{rotary president }
<D>__{but first our benediction will be delivered by reverend phillip hardy of the first presbyterian church.}
<A>__{still tracking we see the reverend get up as the men around him bow their heads.}
<C>__{reverend hardy}
<D>__{heavenly father, please bless us today as we meet in friendship and duty.}
<A>__{still tracking as we reach the end of the table.}
<C>__{reverend hardy }
<D>__{and lord, whatever dangerous endeavors those among us may take, let them never be without your sanctuary.}
<A>__{the camera stops. standing against the wall behind the table is frank. as the reverend's prayer goes on, all heads are bowed to receive the benediction. all heads but frank's. the camera moves in tight on his face.}
<C>__{reverend hardy}
<D>__{... for all we know in our hearts that even though we may walk through the valley of the shadow of death, you are with us... guiding and protecting us. amen.}
<A>__{the reverend's final words segue into rachel's song. frank's searching gaze around the room is arrested for a moment as though reacting to rachel's voice.}
