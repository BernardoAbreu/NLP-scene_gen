<A>__{the full to capacity parking lot is patrolled by a couple of}
<B>__{security guards.}
<A>__{lex cautiously makes his way to the edge of the parking lot and looks at the back side of cobo hall just beyond the chain link fence that surrounds the lot. he crouches down and walks between two cars parked against the fence, looking both ways. seeing a guard's flashlight beam, he sits stock still until the beam sweeps past, then sighs eased.}

<P>__{(whispering to self)}
<D>__{i can't believe i'm actually entertaining the notion of sneaking in. i oughta have my cranium examined.}
<A>__{lex finds a vertical break in the chain link. he lays on his back, slides through, then stands on the other side of the fence. he's at the edge of a weedy, littery field that also happens to be poorly lit.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{whoa. danger will robinson.}
<A>__{spooked, he lays down again intending to slide back through when a flashlight beam hits his eyes.}
<C>__{security guard's voice}
<D>__{hey you! get back in here!}
<A>__{lex sees the guard standing about fifty feet away on the other side of the fence. panicking, he bolts deeper into the field.}
<C>__{security guard's voice}
<D>__{you're not getting far, kid!}
<A>__{lex double times it as we hear the guard yelling into his walkie talkie.}
<C>__{security guard's voice}
<D>__{we got one just ran into the field from the north lot!}
<A>__{the field gets darker as lex closes in on cobo hall's well lit loading dock, where roadies empty the remaining bits of kiss's monstrous set from an 18 wheeler. other huge trucks are parked nearby. there's a bustle of last minute activity.}
