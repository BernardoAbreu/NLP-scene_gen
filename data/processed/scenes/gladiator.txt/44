<L>__{exterior slave market day}
<A>__{the heat of morocco is unlike anything maximus has ever known. shimmering heat waves undulate over the sand. the provincial market is bustling like the proverbial anthill. slave traders and dealers and merchants move around, all talking very quickly and very emphatically. maximus, juba and a number of other slaves are on display, poked and prodded and fondled. their bedouin slave trader sings out their praises to any passers. the crowd parts almost magically for the dramatic arrival of proximo. proximo is a large man of immense appetites. he has the ferocious appearance of a true pirate. two slaves follow behind him and impotently swat at flies with switches.}
<C>__{slave trader}
<D>__{proximo, my old friend, see what i have for you today !}
<A>__{proximo slams a fist into the slave trader's face. the slave trader sails back.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{those giraffes you sold me won't mate! all they do is run around not mating! you sold me eunuch giraffes!!}
<A>__{the slave trader pulls himself up, hugely obsequious.}
<C>__{slave trader}
<D>__{i will make it up to you, master. it's bargain day for you! look, look, look i have two lions and a panther hear how they roar for you! "bring me home, proximo!"}
<A>__{proximo examines the animals.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{how much for the lot?}
<C>__{slave trader}
<D>__{for you 8,000 sesterces.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{for me 6,000 sesterces and i want to see their balls first. and you throw in those two slaves.}
<C>__{slave trader}
<P>__{(moves to maximus)}
<D>__{what about this one? look at the arms!}
<A>__{proximo moves to maximus. the slave trader forces open maximus' mouth.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{good teeth }
<A>__{proximo notes the many old battle scars on maximus' body.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{where did you get those scars?}
<A>__{maximus doesn't respond.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{are you a soldier?}
<A>__{maximus doesn't respond.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{do you speak? }
<P>__{(he roars back to a slave)}
<D>__{keep those damn flies off me!}
<P>__{(back to maximus)}
<D>__{he's dying.}
<C>__{slave trader}
<D>__{1,000 sesterces.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{my ass...}
<P>__{(moves to juba)}
<D>__{you throw in this one and we'll make it 7,000 sesterces for the whole lot.}
<C>__{slave trader}
<D>__{i have to eat, master! he's my finest, i couldn't let him go as part of the lot for less than 9,000 total...}
<P>__{(back to maximus)}
<D>__{i tell you this one is prime. he's a spaniard and killed fourteen of my men before he could be subdued!}
<A>__{proximo looks at maximus, notes the many battle scars again. the scars, and something he senses in maximus' eyes, is enough for proximo to consider it.}
<C>__{proximo}
<P>__{(to trader)}
<D>__{all right, let's see.}
<A>__{the slave trader and his colleagues grab maximus and bustle him across the market, unlocking his chains. maximus has no idea what's going on. in the center of the market place, a veritable giant of a man sits on a small stool, a wooden sword in his hand. he is hunched over and chained to the ground by a ten foot chain shackled to his ankle. a think metal helmet is riveted around his entire head, only long turfs of hair emerging. his dim eyes stare listlessly through a slot in the helmet. the slave trader puts a wooden sword in maximus' hand and shoves him toward the giant. the giant stands. he towers over maximus. the giant suddenly swings his sword he moves with remarkable quickness maximus makes no attempt to block the blow it sends him flying to the ground. maximus pulls himself up. the giant moves in and hits him again maximus recoils the giant hits him again maximus falls. maximus pulls himself up. the giant moves in again he slams him a few more times maximus makes no attempt to protect himself he falls. maximus pulls himself up. the giant is about to attack again }
<C>__{proximo}
<P>__{(to slave trader)}
<D>__{that's enough.}
<C>__{slave trader}
<D>__{stop! stop!}
<A>__{his colleagues race into the ring and haul the giant away from maximus. the giant quietly sits back on his stool. proximo studies maximus for a moment and then glances to the slave trader.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{i will give you 500 sesterces.}
<C>__{slave trader}
<D>__{no no 1,000!}
<C>__{proximo}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{come, don't quibble with your old friend. i will take the lions, the panther, the numidian and this one for 7,000. and i will buy you the best whore in the town for two nights. she's an enormous mountain of flesh who craves a stern hand.}
<C>__{slave trader}
<D>__{how could i say no to my old friend proximo?}
