<C>__{peter}
<D>__{honestly? because i've had this very unusual reaction.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i've had a hard on almost all day and it won't go away. like i'm riding on the back seat of a bus with bad shocks and every other passenger is a gorgeous woman with a yellow sports top whose leaning over. it's like every dream i ever had and some even i didn't have the balls to dream..}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so you're considering taking it?...}
<P>__{(he looks at him)}
<D>__{okay, here's the thing. i can't lose you and still keep the hours i'm keeping. i can't do my life unless i can hold onto you.}
<P>__{(sudden thought)}
<D>__{i think i just gave you an incredible bargaining position.}
