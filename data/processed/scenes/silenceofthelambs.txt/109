<D>__{are you in trouble over this, mr. crawford? can senator martin do something to you?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{i'm 53, starling. if i found jimmy hoffa on national tv, i'd still have to retire in two years. it's not a consideration. but you are...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you've done enough. if i keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. cost you six months, at least. i can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.}

<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{or just as worthless. but i want you in memphis, close to him. maybe when he gets tired of toying with senator martin, he'll talk to you again. there's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.}

<P>__{(he crumples his cup, tosses it)}
<D>__{now's the hardest part, starling. use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. just keep your eyes on catherine. we've got less than 30 hours.}
