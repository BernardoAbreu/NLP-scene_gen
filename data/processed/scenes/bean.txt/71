<A>__{dead slowly, bean puts his hand into his inside jacket pocket and brings it back out made in the shape of a gun. he slowly transfers that imaginary item to the finger and thumb of his left hand. he bends down and places it on the floor then takes three paces back. he gives out a big breath after the effort of it all. the cops just stare at him, gob smacked. little old lady from plane steers up from nowhere. she rattles her box of broken china and kicks bean in the shins. things are not going his way.}
