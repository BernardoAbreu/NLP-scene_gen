<A>__{the car pulls away from a close angle on the trunk and as camera holds we see that we are now in a swamp area. it is quiet except for the irritating noises of night insects. norman stops the car at the very edge of the swamp, turns off the lights, gets out, leaving door open. he looks at the swamp, seems doubtful of its ability to swallow up the car, realizes he has no choice. he leans into the car, releases the emergency brake, starts to push. the front of the car begins to roll into the swamp. suddenly there is the low, throbbing sound of a motor. norman freezes, listens. the sound grows louder and norman realizes it is an airplane flying overhead. the car is rolling quickly now. norman jumps away, slams the door shut, stands tense. the sound of the plane overhead grows louder. norman looks up. norman's viewpoint the black sky we see no plane. the sound of the motor is beginning to diminish.}
