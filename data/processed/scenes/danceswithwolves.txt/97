<L>__{interior ten bears' lodge night}
<A>__{another council is in progress. as before, the leading men are seated around ten bears' fire while the other warriors stand packed in the shadows. wind in his hair is seated close to the elders.}
<C>__{ten bears}
<D>__{i am in agreement with kicking bird. we will go down and talk to the white man and find out what kind of white man he is.}
<A>__{wind in his hair jumps into the conversation.}
<C>__{wind in his hair}
<D>__{if this council decides to talk with the man at the soldier fort then it will be so. but in my mind it is not right that a sioux chief, a chief as great as ten bears, goes to ask the business of a puny, trespassing white man... a white soldier who has only a smart horse and a few white man clothes.}
<A>__{there are many yeses in response to this. as is his custom, ten bears lets the outburst subside, seeming unruffled all the while. casually, he pops a piece of meat into his mouth and begins to chew.}
<C>__{ten bears}
<D>__{i will not go... you will go... you and kicking bird. that is all i have to say.}
