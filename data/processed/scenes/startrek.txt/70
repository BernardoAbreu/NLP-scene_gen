<L>__{interior vulcan science academy council chamber day}
<A>__{an imposing yet beautiful indoor atrium. spock stands before the vulcan high council. among faces on the dais: his father, seated beside the science minister and other vulcan leaders.}
<C>__{science minister}
<D>__{you have surpassed the expectations of your instructors. your final record is flawless. with one exception. i see you have applied to starfleet as well.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{it was logical to cultivate multiple options.}
<C>__{science minister}
<D>__{logical but unnecessary. you are hereby accepted to the vulcan science academy. a distinction all the more significant given that you will be its first half human pupil. it is truly remarkable, spock. that you have achieved so much despite your disadvantage. welcome to the academy.}
<A>__{they all start to rise. but spock is suddenly unsettled:}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{if you would clarify, minister what "disadvantage" are you referring to?}
<C>__{science minister}
<D>__{... your human mother.}
<A>__{as the council disperses, we push in on spock's face the same look he had when he took punches as a kid. he glances at his father to say something, but sarek's the consummate diplomat. his eyes command: remain calm. spock struggles... then makes the first spontaneous human decision of his life }
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{council ministers. i must decline.}
<A>__{everyone stops. a solid beat. confused looks turn cold:}
<C>__{science minister}
<D>__{no vulcan has ever declined admission to this academy.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{then as i am half human, your record remains untarnished.}
<C>__{sarek spock}
<A>__{spock. you have made a commitment to honor the vulcan at the moment, father, i can way think of no greater way to}
<D>__{honor our race than to attend starfleet as its first vulcan.}
<C>__{science minister}
<D>__{why did you come before this council today? was it to satisfy your emotional need to rebel?}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{i came with the intention of enrolling, as my father wished. however, your "insight" has convinced me otherwise. therefore, the only emotion i wish to convey is gratitude. thank you, ministers, for your consideration.}
<P>__{(a contained "fuck you")}
<D>__{live long and prosper.}
<A>__{he looks to his father, whose disappointment is evident still, god bless him, spock walks out }
