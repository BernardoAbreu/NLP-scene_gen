<D>__{you're strong. do you hear me? you're a fucking warrior. nothing scares you. in fact you happen to be the single most powerful woman on earth. now what did you see?}
<A>__{the words slowly take affect. kimberly becomes centered, getting her breath back, and speaks without a hitch.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{i was driving a white van. it must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and i drowned. it was...horrible.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{you were there?}
<C>__{kimberly}

<D>__{so let's do it.}
<C>__{thomas}
<P>__{(realization)}
<D>__{shit, i don't have her number. she was never interviewed. she took off right after the accident.}
