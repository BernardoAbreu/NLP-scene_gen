<L>__{exterior bank day}
<A>__{sam approaches the bank, and when she sees the tall sign with the digital clock, she stops and stares up at it. it strikes a chord but she doesn't know why... the sign reads 12:48 pm and then june 20, 1995. it changes to the fireworks countdown: 14 days, 8 hours, 11 minutes, 22 seconds... 21 seconds...}
<L>__{interior bank day}
<A>__{sam enters the small bank, and as she approaches the counter she sees that trudy potter is in tears. some of her female co workers are consoling her.}
<C>__{trudy}
<D>__{i don't believe it... i still just don't believe it. female co worker it's gonna be alright. you'll see.}
<A>__{trudy looks up and sees sam waiting uncomfortably.}
<C>__{trudy}
<P>__{(dabbing at her eyes with a tissue)}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{is everything okay?}
<C>__{trudy}
<D>__{no, it's not... mount calvary burned to the ground last night.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{mount calvary?}
<C>__{trudy}
<D>__{father homeijer's church.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{oh... how did it happen?}
<C>__{trudy}
<D>__{the police are looking into it, but... i know it was arson.}
<A>__{trudy leans in to talk quietly to sam.}
<C>__{trudy }
<D>__{it's no secret to me how people in this town feel about father homeijer. the horrible accusations that have been made against him... but it's just a lot of nonsense. el reno's changed so much since i was a kid growing up here. the young people nowadays...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no offense.}
<A>__{she places her hand on top of sam's.}
<C>__{trudy }
<D>__{but with all the drugs and the crime... i just don't know what this world's coming to anymore.}
<A>__{sam tries to redirect her focus.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{are you able to get money wired here from my bank back home?}
<C>__{trudy}
<D>__{we don't usually work with other banks like that.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i need to check my balance and get my money out. how do i do that?}
<C>__{trudy}
<D>__{you'll have to call and arrange it. you could always use western union. where's your bank?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{virginia.}
<C>__{trudy}
<D>__{oh... `cause they're gonna need to have a signature.}
<A>__{disappointed, sam turns to leave... angle: near exit as she's on her way out, she notices a bulletin board with another missing persons sign for billy moorcroft. she stands before the picture, staring into the young boy's dark, empty eyes. though it's just a low quality black & white photo, billy's face emotes profound hopelessness and despair.}
