<L>__{interior waiting room detective bureau day}
<A>__{lowenstein makes heather and roz comfortable in the waiting room, then goes through the gate partition, nods at the cop clerk on duty, and goes into oscar grace's office, re closing the door behind him.}
<L>__{interior grace's office day}
<A>__{it's cramped, hot, cluttered. there is one other door out of the office. grace has his feet up on his desk. he's nursing a bottle of coke and looking at racine, who stands across the office, leaning on a file cabinet and glaring between sentences. racine gives lowenstein an ugly look then returns his attention to grace. racine is angry, but in control.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{that's right. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{racine }
<D>__{i've been down there a lot lately. isn't that amazing? miami. jesus. i'm handling the purchase of some property down there. i will be going back in the future... if that's all right, if it's still legal to go to miami.}
<A>__{there is silence. lowenstein looks between them, speaks to grace.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{he is mad.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{nooo. no, i'm not mad. why should i be mad just because my friend here, who i've know for years, wants to know of my whereabouts on the night of our recent local murder?}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{it's not so recent anymore. maybe he's feeling some pressure.}
<A>__{grace is pained by all this, but his tone is scolding, defensive.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you brought this on yourself, man! i don't run this department, you know. there are people watching this thing. they hear you're out there banging the widow every night; it tends to call attention to you. so don't give me shit.}
<A>__{lowenstein goes to oscar's desk and takes a pull from the bottle of coke.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{that's my business!}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{this whole damn case is getting crazy.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<P>__{(to grace)}
<D>__{did you tell him about the glasses?}
<A>__{grace, exasperated, indicates that he didn't.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{seems walker always ware glasses steel rimmed glasses. he was a real fanatic about them. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<A>__{racine is still staring at grace. he barely seems to pay attention.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{but there were none on the scene. coroner says they should've been there. he says that even after the fire the frames should've been seared into his well, you don't want to hear the details.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{so what?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{so it's looking more and more like he was killed somewhere else and brought there in his own car. your honey, his wife, says he left the house in the middle of the night driving himself to some mysterious meeting. is that vague enough for you?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{look, what is this? what do you want? am i supposed to be an undercover agent for you guys, or something?}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{interesting choice of phrase.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{how 'bout tonight i ask her? 'say, did you kill your husband? my friends were just wondering...'}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{hey, that's an idea. ask her where the glasses are, where she did it... anything else i'm forgetting, oscar?}
<C>__{oscar}
<D>__{just one thing.}
<A>__{lowenstein looks at him a long moment. racine watches them.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{oh, yeah! right, right. you'll love this, ned, this latest development. maybe you'll be able to work up a little sympathy for us, see why oscar here has a tendency to get carried away. tell him, oscar. this is rich. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{oscar}
<D>__{this is from the sister in law, the kraft woman. she's been driving me batty lately. she's convinced she ain't gonna be out into the will. it seems that a couple weeks before the murder, walker's niece stayed up there for a while with your friend matty. one night she waxes up, goes to see her aunt and catches the lady with some guy.}
<A>__{the three men look at each other. lowenstein breaks into laughter.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{do you get it? in the act or some fucking thing!}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{we haven't got all the details yet. mrs. kraft is bringing the little girl up here today to tell us her story.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<P>__{(to grace)}
<D>__{oh, they're here. i ran into them on the way in. they're waiting outside.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{christ. i'm not sure i'm up to dealing with this scene.}
<A>__{there is a long pause. the other two look at racine.}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(to racine)}
<D>__{listen, you probably don't want to see the kraft woman right now. she's a little wild. why don't you slip out the back way here?}
<A>__{racine looks first at lowenstein, then at grace.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{are we done here?}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(nods, looking at his notes)}
<D>__{i've got it all here. and, ned, i'm sorry i had to ask.}
<A>__{racine is neutral. he indicates the front entrance.}
<D>__{converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i will go out this way. i've had a lot of experience with disgruntled people.}
<P>__{(to lowenstein)}
<D>__{i will be over to stella's, if you want to have some lunch.}
<A>__{lowenstein nods. racine opens the door and goes out of the office.}
