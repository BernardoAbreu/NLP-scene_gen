<A>__{lined up at a zinc bar are several butchers, their white smocks stained with blood. reggie and bartholomew sit at the table.}
<C>__{bartholomew}
<D>__{i suppose you're old enough to have heard of world war two?}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{barely, yes.}
<C>__{bartholomew}
<D>__{in 1944, five members of the o.s.s. the military espionage unit were ordered behind the german lines for the purpose of delivering $250,000 in gold to the french underground. the five men }
<A>__{a waiter arrives.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{vous desirez?}
<C>__{reggie}

<C>__{bartholomew}
<P>__{(to the waiter)}
<D>__{cafe.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{gratinee, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes et un ballon de rouge.}
<C>__{bartholomew}
<D>__{mrs. lampert, i really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{can i at least keep the onion soup?}
<A>__{bartholomew shrugs.}
<C>__{reggie}
<P>__{(to the waiter)}
<D>__{la soupe tout simplement.}
<A>__{the waiter nods and goes.}
<C>__{reggie}
<P>__{(anxiously)}
<D>__{go on, please five men $250,000 the french underground }
<C>__{bartholomew}
<D>__{yes. the five men. they were, of course, your husband, charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and carson dyle. but something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. it must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{steal it how?}
<C>__{bartholomew}
<D>__{by burying it, and then reporting that the germans had captured it. all they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.}
<C>__{reggie}
<P>__{(fascinated)}
<D>__{may i have a cigarette, please?}
<A>__{bartholomew pulls out a package and she takes one, looks at it and rips off the filter tip. he winces.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{i hate these things it's like drinking coffee through a veil.}
<A>__{she puts the other end in her mouth, then picks up the matches and lights it.}
<C>__{bartholomew}
<D>__{everything went smoothly enough until after the gold was buried then, before they could get out, they were ambushed by a german patrol. a machine gun separated scobie from his right hand and caught carson dyle full in the stomach.}
<A>__{reggie takes another cigarette from his pack, rips off the filter (he winces again) and puts it into her mouth.}
<C>__{bartholomew}
<D>__{what's wrong with that one?}
<A>__{he points to the cigarette she just lit, still practically brand new in the ashtray.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{oh. nothing, i guess. what happened then?}
<A>__{she hands over the newer one to bartholomew, who sadly examines its mutilated end while reggie returns to the first cigarette.}
<C>__{bartholomew}
<D>__{have you any idea what these things cost over here?}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{please go on, mr. bartholomew what happened then?}
<C>__{bartholomew}
<D>__{scobie was able to travel, but carson dyle was clearly dying, so they }
<A>__{the waiter returns with the coffee and onion soup.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{la soupe, c'est pour qui?}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{pour moi. go on, mr. bartholomew.}
<A>__{the waiter puts down the cup and bowl and leaves.}
<C>__{bartholomew}
<D>__{carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. they finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. only charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. he beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. it's taken gideon, tex and scobie all this time to catch up with him again.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{but if they stole all that money why can't you arrest them?}
<C>__{bartholomew}
<D>__{we know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together but we still have no proof.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{but what has all this got to do with the c.i.o.?}
<C>__{bartholomew}
<D>__{c.i.a., mrs. lampert. we're an extension of the wartime o.s.s. it was our money and we want it back.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mr. bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. i still intend leaving paris tonight.}
<C>__{bartholomew}
<D>__{i wouldn't advise that, mrs. lampert. you'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. those men won't be very far away no matter where you go. in fact, i don't even see any point in your changing hotels. please help us, mrs. lampert. your government is counting on you.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{well, if i'm going to die, i might as well do it for my country.}
<C>__{bartholomew}
<D>__{that's the spirit.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{oh, stop it. what do you want me to do?}
<C>__{bartholomew}
<D>__{we're anxious to know who this man is the one calling himself dyle.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{maybe he really is dyle. he could still be alive.}
<C>__{bartholomew}
<D>__{no, mrs. lampert.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{but no one actually saw him die.}
<C>__{bartholomew}
<D>__{no, mrs. lampert. his death is registered with the war department in washington.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{oh. then who's this one?}
<C>__{bartholomew}
<D>__{i don't know but i think you'd better find out, don't you?}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{me? why me?}
<C>__{bartholomew}
<D>__{you're in an ideal position he trusts you.}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.}
<C>__{reggie}
<P>__{(resigned)}
<D>__{agents.}
