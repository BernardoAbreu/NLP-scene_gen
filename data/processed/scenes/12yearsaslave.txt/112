<L>__{interior slave shack night}
<A>__{again, the slaves have been herded into the shack and pressed together. as he tries to rest sleep is nearly impossible solomon finds himself face to face with a woman, anna. she is awake. for a few beats she avoids eye contact with solomon. she seems, like solomon, to be unaccustomed to her surroundings and horribly frightened by them. eventually her eyes meet solomon's. she makes no sound, but great apprehension spills from her eyes. whatever's next, whatever horror awaits, she can barely stand to face. fear, proximity... they drive her han to solomon's. after a moment of seemingly reacquainting herself with genuine human contact, the woman takes solomon's hand and presses it to her breast. solomon tries to jerk his hand away, but anna holds it in place. manipulating solomon's hand, she begins to massage her breast. solomon takes no real pleasure in the act really, neither does anna. there should be a true sense anna is just so very, very desperate for human contact,}
<B>__{for the need to feel alive and like a person rather than an animal that emotionally she is willing to engage solomon.}
<A>__{the need quickly compounds. anna presses her lips to solomon's. eventually, she directs his hand beneath her dress and between her legs. solomon, with slightly more compassion than a guy making union wages, begins to manipulate anna with his hand. the act remains more perfunctory than passionate. we can see anna moving toward climax and eventual release. but more or substantially less than joyous sex, it is really just a drug like inoculation against reality. but the feeling quickly fades. all that remains, as with most chance encounters, is regret. and there is shame, too. this is put on display as anna turns away from solomon. as quickly as it began, it is as though the act had not happened at all.}
