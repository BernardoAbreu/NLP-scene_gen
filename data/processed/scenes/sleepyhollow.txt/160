<A>__{a fire burns in a circle of rocks. ichabod's ledger is thrown in. the pages catch quickly. ichabod watches, then walks away. he's about to climb onto gunpowder, but on second thought he opens his satchel and digs out a book. he walks back to the fire, throws it on... "romeo and juliet." flames devour it.}
