<A>__{seated perspiring on a hard bench in a stifling office. outside: palm trees; we're in miami. and judging from the number of cigarette butts strewn around the bench, bernstein's been there a while. waiting. nervous. and maybe he never will be able to get it together, who knows. at the front, a secretary sits filing her nails. behind her are a number of closed doors to offices. no one passes without her ok. the clock hits three in the afternoon as bernstein gets up from the bench, goes to the secretary.}
