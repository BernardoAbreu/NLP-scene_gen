<A>__{kaufman, wearing his purple sweater sans tags, sits with valerie, an attractive woman in wire rim glasses. they pick at salads. kaufman steals glances at her lips, her hair, her breasts. she looks up at him. he blanches, looks away.}
<C>__{kaufman }
<D>__{i'm old. i'm bald. i'm repulsive.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{we think you're just great.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<P>__{(with studied modesty)}
<D>__{oh, thank you.}
<A>__{valerie absently rubs her nose. kaufman self consciously rubs his nose in response.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{and we're thrilled you're interested.}
<A>__{valerie rubs her nose again. kaufman pulls at his nostril. a rivulet of sweat slides down his forehead. valerie watches it. kaufman sees her watching it. she sees him seeing her watching it. she looks at her salad. he quickly swabs.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{oh, thanks, wow. that's nice to hear.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{you have a really unique voice.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{well, thanks. that's... i appreciate that.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{very talented. really.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{thanks. thank you. thanks.}
<C>__{valerie}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{so }
<A>__{kaufman's brow is dripping again. he smiles, embarrassed.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{sort of hot in here.}
<C>__{valerie}
<P>__{(kindly)}
<D>__{yeah, it is a bit. so, why don't you tell me your thoughts on this crazy little project of ours.}
<A>__{in one motion, kaufman swabs his forehead and pulls a book entitled the orchid thief from his bag.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{first, i think it's a great book.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{laroche is a fun character, isn't he?}
<A>__{kaufman nods, flips through the book, stalling. there's a smiling author photo of susan orlean on the inside back cover.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{and orlean makes orchids so fascinating. plus her musings on florida, orchid poaching. indians. great, sprawling new yorker stuff. i'd want to remain true to that, let the movie exist rather than be artificially plot driven.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{okay, great, great. i guess i'm not exactly sure what that means.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{oh. well... i'm not sure exactly yet either. so... y'know, it's...}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{oh. okay. great. so, um, what }
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{it's just, i don't want to compromise by making it a hollywood product. an orchid heist movie. or changing the orchids into poppies and turning it into a movie about drug running. y'know?}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{oh, of course. we agree. definitely.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{or cramming in sex, or car chases, or guns. or characters learning profound life lessons. or characters growing or characters changing or characters learning to like each other or characters overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end. y'know? movie shit.}
<A>__{kaufman is sweating like crazy now. valerie is quiet for a moment.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{see, we thought maybe susan orlean and laroche could fall in love during the course of }
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{alienated journalist writes about passionate backwoods guy and he teaches her to love. i mean, it didn't happen, it wouldn't happen. it's hollywood.}
