<L>__{interior mark's apartment building lobby morning}
<A>__{mark, exhausted from his long night, waits for the elevator to arrive. the elevator doors open and frank, the depressive neighbor, steps out.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{hey there, frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{mark. how's it going?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{pretty good, thanks.}
<A>__{frank stops and turns around, this is a different response.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yeah. you?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{awful. i was doing some internet research last night about suffocation suicide. i'm probably going to give that a try tonight.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{oh.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{all right. bye, frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{bye.}
<A>__{mark gets in the elevator, frank walks away. a short beat. mark exits the elevator and yells after frank.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{frank!}
<A>__{frank, halfway out the building, turns around.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{don't do it.}
<A>__{frank thinks this over.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{why not? i'm miserable. and no one will care.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i will care.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you're a loser, though.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{don't do it, frank. things are going to be all right.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{they are?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes. you're going to meet someone soon. you won't be so lonely. things are going to turn around at your job.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{my job's actually fine.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{well, things are going to get better. better than they are.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what about the depression?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it will go away very soon. you're going to be happy soon, frank. you just need to wait for it. listen to me: you don't need to kill yourself.}
<A>__{something changes in frank. a slight smile comes over him.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{really.}
<A>__{frank laughs.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{wow. man, and that suffocation thing really seemed like a good idea.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it wasn't.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay. well, my night's open now. you want to hang out later?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i don't know. not really.}
<A>__{frank's smile fades a tiny bit.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{sure. of course. let's hang out.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i will see you after work.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{great.}
<A>__{mark gets back in the elevator to the sound of frank laughing to himself as he exits the building. we hold on mark for a moment as he smiles and nods his head.}
