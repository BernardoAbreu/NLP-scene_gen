<P>__{(calm to justice)}
<D>__{we have a very simple gang here, justice. i'm the brains, chrissy's the brawn, and missy's the tech girl. but lately, i'm having a hard time figuring out what you're doing here.}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{that makes two of us.}
<C>__{chrissy}
<D>__{shit your name doesn't even fit the rhyme scheme.}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{that's because very few names rhyme with "douchebag."}
