<D>__{'mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord...'}
<A>__{from behind the doors we hear the whir of an elevator. it stops with a clunk. suddenly... new angle doorway bursts open and abraham lincoln in a mini float appears. it's decked out like lincoln's box at ford's theater. on its own power, it moves past the laughing party goers in the foyer. now the women throw grapes on the floor.}

<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{'he has trampled down the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored!'}
<A>__{west's pov angle on wheels of wheelchair are what's trampling down the vintage. west takes in the whole man. very curious. then suddenly... kaboom! angle on abe's head it explodes like a pinata. up from the hole in his neck peeps... dr. arliss loveless.}
<C>__{loveless}
<P>__{(impishly)}
<D>__{don't you just hate that song?}
<A>__{the southern crowd gasps at loveless's dramatic appearance.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{why, y'all look like you've seen a ghost! it's me, dear friends, alive and kicking! well, alive, anyway...}
<A>__{as he giggles, the distaff corps surround him and remove the lincoln paraphernalia. then step aside, revealing... new angle dr. loveless is half a man. literally. cut off at the waist and mounted on a wheelchair platform that is powered by an engine, he is a man bereft of tuchus, kishkes and everything else in that vicinity that makes life interesting.}

<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{we may've lost the war, but heaven knows... we haven't lost our sense of humor!}
<A>__{dr. loveless looks down at himself, smoothes half of his fritz lang metropolis style suit. his face turns dark as he surveys the crowd.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{not even when we've lost a lung... a spleen... a bladder... two legs... thirty five feet of small intestine and our ability to reproduce...}
<P>__{(like a preacher)}
<D>__{all in the name of the south...}
<P>__{(then quietly)}
<D>__{... do we lose our sense of humor.}
<A>__{you can hear a pin drop. loveless turns to the foreign dignitaries.}

<D>__{so...! mi casa es su casa! ma maison est a vous! let the party begin!!!}
<A>__{loveless signals to the quartets to resume playing. miss east leans down and whispers in his ear. loveless looks in west's direction. now loveless wheels over to west. west isn't hiding. he's cocky in the face of rolling danger.}
