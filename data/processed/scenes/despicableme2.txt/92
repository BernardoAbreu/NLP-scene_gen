<A>__{one continues chopping everything in sight with his axe, then chops his way right through the wall of the house and falls outside. another minion brings in a massive hose, turns it on, and goes flying around the room as it whips around like a snake. dave tests out a fire extinguisher.}
<C>__{siren minion }
<D>__{beedo! beedo! beedo! beedo!}
<A>__{gru takes away the bullhorn from the siren minion. but he keeps on making the noise.}
