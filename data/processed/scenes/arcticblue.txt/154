<A>__{flashlight in hand, gloriously drunk, lemalle stumbles outside. he crosses to the jeep to grab a box of twinkies and, as long as he's at it, take a leak in a snowbank. bleary eyed, he notices the damage to the utility compartment inflicted by the bear. he walks to it, stepping over the bear scat. he marvels at the size and depth of the clawmarks.}

<A>__{lemalle tries the door, but it's jammed shut. he tucks his flashlight under his arm and gives another tug. this time the door cracks open. closer his pov he peers through the opening and shines his flashlight in. a pair of eyes stare back at him.}

<A>__{lemalle jumps back, startled, and pulls out his knife. he tries the door again. it wrenches open... ...he's looking at his own face in one of anne marie's mirrored photo reflector boards. letting his breath out, lemalle pokes around the equipment in the compartment. ever larcenous, he pulls a few items out, examines them, and, disinterested, leaves them in the snow. doing so, he comes close to uncovering anne marie, who sits motionless and terrified in the back of the compartment. nothing in the compartment catches lemalle's fancy. leaving the door hanging open, he wanders away.}
