<ACTION>__{She hands him the airplane-sized bottle -- he waves off the glass. She shrugs, leaving... Pasqual to resume what he was doing. Slowly, he removes a roll of Certs. He looks to Jones -- "Well? What about your end of the bargain?" From within his dashiki, Jones pulls out a black velvet pouch. He hands it to Pasqual, who opens it to find diamonds. A helluva lot of diamonds. Pasqual smiles. He hands the roll of Certs to Jones. It's not breath candy at all, but a tiny roll of explosives, with a tiny, high-tech triggering mechanism.}

All three are still free-falling. James Earl Jones nods at the Skydiver who, even under the helmet and goggles, is clearly a beautiful woman. Meet ALEXANDRA "ALEX" MUNDAY, one of Charlie's Angels. She's a sultry bombshell -- a classic femme fatale -- only she's playing for the good guys. She gives James Earl Jones a wink, then jerks Pasqual's rip cord and -- WHOOMPH. Pasqual's chute deploys. He flies upward, leaving -- Alex and James Earl Jones, both still falling.    Below the ocean screams up at them. Not much time left. James Earl Jones pulls his belt -- and his mufti flies up. It's actually a tiny drogue chute, deploying his entire dashiki. His outfit hides a parachute rig. Alex pulls her own rip cord and -- WHOOMPH -- her chute unfurls, and now...

Natalie glances ahead, maneuvering the boat perfectly under Alex, who drops on deck. Alex gathers her chute, then whips off her helmet to give her cascading mane a wild shake. Here comes James Earl Jones. Natalie guns the boat underneath...a perfect catch. Alex helps him with his dashiki-chute, and then all three look up... Here comes Pasqual. Natalie whips the boat around, catching him as he helplessly drops into the seats, still bound, still scared out of his wits. He gapes wild-eyed at the two Angels, then whirls on James Earl Jones.}

NATALIE, with a page-boy cut and wearing a Catholic schoolgirl's uniform, sports glasses and braces; a bit awkward and gangly, even shy. ALEX, formally dressed with perfect pig-tails, is sophisticated and self-possessed; a class act, even at ten. DYLAN, wild blond hair and faded T-shirt, has a jaded, street-wise smirk; even at this young age, her isolation and disillusionment are masked by seeming confidence.}
