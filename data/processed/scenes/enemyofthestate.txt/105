<L>__{interior rachel's condo building night}
<A>__{dean watches from the shadows. it seems quiet. he's about to move for the entrance when he sees a cigarette lighter flame up inside a parked car. two men sit inside, watching. dean retreats into the shadows.}
<L>__{interior rachel's condo back entrance night}
<A>__{quiet. dean listens through the door and hears nothing. he knocks softly. no reply. he tries the doorknob. it opens.}
<L>__{interior rachel's kitchen night}
<A>__{dean enters. the place is still.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{rachel?}
<A>__{no answer. dean drifts through the living room. a lamp is knocked over on the floor. dean keeps moving into the bedroom. he stops in the doorway eyes fixed inside. dean's pov: rachel lies on her stomach, naked in bed.}
<C>__{dean}
<P>__{(approaching)}
<D>__{rachel?}
<A>__{she doesn't respond. he touches her. nothing. he turns her over. her face is frozen, eyes open, neck purpled and bruised with signs of strangulation.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{oh god }
<A>__{dean wants to throw up but holds it down. then, under a night table, he sees a shirt. he grabs it. dean's pov: an oxford button down. the inside collar is stamped with a dry cleaner's marker reading: r. dean. panic overtakes horror as dean quickly searches for anything else of his that may have been planted inside the apartment. under the bed a cufflink. in the bathroom a hairbrush. on the desk documents with his name on them. dean shoves everything into a garbage bag. grabbing a towel, he retraces his steps, wiping his prints from everything he touched. exiting, he wipes off the doorknob as a neighbors door opens. a couple stumbles out, laughing, kissing...and noticing dean leaving rachel's condo.}
