<L>__{interior chance's room morning}
<A>__{chance is in bed, a bed tray on his lap, eating breakfast. a pile of the morning's newspapers lies at the foot of the bed, untouched. the tv is playing, chance watches as he eats. there is a knock at the door.}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(without turning from tv)}
<D>__{come in!}
<A>__{eve enters, wearing a robe over her nightgown.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{chauncey! have you seen the papers?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{no, eve. i don't read the papers.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(moving to bed)}
<D>__{well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the president's speech. and your own comments from the 'this evening' show are quoted side by side with the president's.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{i like the president. he is a very nice man.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(sits on bed)}
<D>__{i know...}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{... so are you, chauncey ...}
<P>__{(another moment, chance watches tv)}
<D>__{... do you mind my being here, like this?}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(a bite of toast)}
<D>__{no, eve. i like you to be here.}
<A>__{eve smiles, moves a little closer to chance.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{... you know, chauncey... i want us to be...}
<P>__{(with difficulty)}
<D>__{i want us... you and i to become... close... i want us to become very close, you know...?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes, eve. i know that.}
<A>__{eve suddenly begins to cry, sobbing quietly at first, then losing control, the tears flowing freely. to comfort her, chance puts his arm around her shoulder, nearly tipping his breakfast tray. eve responds to his touch, draws closer, holds chance tightly. chance does his best to avoid spilling his breakfast, keep an eye on the tv, and to comfort eve. she gives in to her desires, begins to caress chance, running her hand over his body. she kisses him, his eyes, his neck, his lips, his ears. chance does not return the lovemaking, and eve eventually catches hold of herself, stops. she lies quietly beside chance for a time, regains her demeanor, then speaks.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{... i'm grateful to you, chauncey... i would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...}
<P>__{(chance,confused, turns to her)}
<D>__{... but you're so strong i can trust myself with you. i'm glad, chauncey i'm glad that you showed so much restrainterior..}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes, eve. i'm very glad that you didn't open.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i know you are, chauncey...}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{... you conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(another bite of toast)}
<D>__{yes. that could be true.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(sits up)}
<D>__{... i guess i may as well be honest about my feelings, chauncey, as i know you are i am in love with you... i love you and i want you... and i know that you know it and i'm grateful that you've decided to wait until... until...}
<A>__{eve cannot bring herself to finish the sentence. she rises, straightens her robe and moves toward the door.}
<C>__{eve }
<P>__{(stopping by door)}
<D>__{... i do love you, chauncey.}
<A>__{a knock at the door startles eve. she turns, opens it to maggie, the seam tress. maggie carries one of rand's tuxedos.}
<C>__{eve }
<D>__{oh, come in, maggie.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(entering)}
<D>__{yes, ma'am.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{chauncey, maggie will alter ben's tuxedo for you now.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{eve leaves. maggie stands by patiently as chance eats his once warm scrambled eggs and watches"mr. rogers neighborhood" on tv.}
