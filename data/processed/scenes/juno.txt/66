<A>__{bren sits at the kitchen table with a mug of coffee and an issue of dog fancy. juno enters nonchalantly, drinking a giant slushie.}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{where the hell have you been, junebug?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i drove to st. cloud to show mark and vanessa the ultrasound. and i wound up staying for a couple of hours.}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{a couple of hours? why are you going up there in the first place?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{they said they wanted to know about this stuff. they said to keep them updated, so i did!}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{you could have sent it to them. why would you drive an hour out to east jesus, nowhere?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i don't know, i just did. and while we were waiting for vanessa, mark and i watched the wizard of gore and he burned me some cds of weird music. he's kind of cool.}
<A>__{a beat as bren absorbs this.}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{that was a mistake, juno. mark is a married stranger. you overstepped a boundary.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{listen, bren duhhh, i think you're the one overstepping boundaries. you're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. besides, who cares if he's married? i can have friends who are married.}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{it doesn't work that way, kiddo. you don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{you don't know anything about me!}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{i know enough.}
<A>__{bren rises to leave, clutching the dog fancy magazine.}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(gesturing to the magazine)}
<D>__{we don't even have a dog!}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. i've made a lot of sacrifices for you, juno. and in a couple years you're going to move out and i'm getting weimaraners.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{wow, dream big!}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{oh, go fly a kite.}
<A>__{bren storms out. juno heads to the urn by the door and defiantly pours the remains of her blue slushie into it.}
