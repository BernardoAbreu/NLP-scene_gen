<L>__{interior classroom. day}
<A>__{jenny's english class file past miss stubbs at the end of a lesson. miss stubbs stops jenny.}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{jenny, could i have a word?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{of course.(to hattie and tina)}
<D>__{i will catch you up.}
<A>__{miss stubbs waits until the room empties.}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{you can do anything you want, jenny. you know that. you're clever and you're pretty... but sometimes those things fight. i'm worried that at the moment clever jenny and pretty jenny are fighting.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{i couldn't bear it if clever jenny lost. it's because of people like you that i plough through illiterate essays by sandra lovell about her pony. and there aren't many of you, i can tell you. one every few years. is your boyfriend interested in clever jenny?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{interested enough to let her do what she wants?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{he couldn't stop me.}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{he might not have to stop you. that's what i'm trying to tell you.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{i'm not sure what you're trying to tell me.}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{i'm telling you to go to oxford. no matter what. or you'll break my heart.}
<A>__{jenny looks at her.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{where did you go?}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{sorry?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(louder, bolder)}
<D>__{where did you go? which university?}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{girton. cambridge.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{what does that mean? `oh'?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you're clever. and you're pretty. so presumably, clever miss stubbs won. and here you are, reading all those pony essays. i don't know. these last few months, i've been to paris, and to jazz clubs, and i've eaten in wonderful restaurants, and seen wonderful films, heard beautiful music...}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{i'm sure you have. but i was filled up with beautiful things, books and music and conversation, in exactly the same way at cambridge. and i didn't have to pay the same sort of price. are you taking precautions, jenny?}
<A>__{jenny stares at her angrily.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{it's nothing to do with that.}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{isn't it?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{maybe our lives are always going to end up with pony essays. or housework. and yes, maybe we'll go up to oxford. but if we're all going to die the moment we graduate, maybe it's what we do before that counts.}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{i'm sorry you think i'm dead.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i don't think you're dead. but...}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{you'd better get to your next class.}
<A>__{she turns her back on jenny.}
