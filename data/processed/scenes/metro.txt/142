<L>__{exterior alleyway night}
<A>__{narrow, dark and dripping with rain. roper arrives at the mouth of the alley. gun ready, he moves cautiously, eyes adjusting to the darkness. the patter of rain off the rooftops. his footsteps. no other sound. he reaches the end of the alley... a brick wall. no way out. or so it would seem. however, clarence is nowhere in sight. roper turns back. brick walls tower on both sides, rising into darkness. roper checks a steel door. locked. he checks another one on the opposite side of the alley. also locked. where did clarence go? he moves back toward the misting light of the street... slowly... the faint rattle of a fire escape... and clarence leaps down out of the shadow. slashing with the knife. he catches roper across the arm. rips through his clothes right down to the skin. roper's gun clatters under a parked car and into the street. clarence has first jump. he scrambles into the street, around the car and grabs the gun... roper dives over the hood of the car and knocks clarence down before he can aim. they roll into the middle of the street. both have a death grip on the weapon. clarence fights like a trapped animal. thrashing desperately. roper pins him on his back, but can't pry the gun out of his fingers.}
<B>__{wider shot}
<A>__{headlights radiate over the crest of the hill. coming quickly. roper sees this. he rolls out of the way, abandoning the battle for the gun. clarence struggles to his knees. turns the weapon on roper... a speeding cab lunges over the top of the hill. clarence turns, trapped in the searing headlights. tires squeal. brakes lock. clarence is transfixed... wham! he's launched through the air like a ragdoll... his body lands limply 30 feet down the street. the cabby gets out of his vehicle.}
