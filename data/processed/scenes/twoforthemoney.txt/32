<L>__{interior high end, brooklyn salon day}
<A>__{toni morrow looks into camera, styles an attractive, 30 ish woman's hair as the woman regards her face in a mirror woman i'm just thinking of doing some work around the eyes. tighten it up a bit. a lift here, look, see these lines?}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{i see a beautiful woman. what are you all of 35? i have a girlfriend, she was stunning, went in to "tighten it up a bit" and came out with a permanent smile. even when she cries she looks like she's laughing. another, she's on her third eye lift. her skin's so tight, i swear, if you put an egg shell on her butt she'd look like a baby bird.}
<C>__{woman}
<A>__{i'm just thinking of a tune up.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{oh yeah, first it's a tune up, then it's something else, and one day you'll come teetering in with your new 36cs and a stretched face and you won't be able to say how unhappy you are because of all the collagen they shot in your lips. do youself a favor. skip the surgery and get a shrink, work on the inside.}
<C>__{woman}
<A>__{easy for you to say. you used to model. the other women customers listening nearby nod in agreement.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{oh yeah, that's true. those were the good days. sometimes i like to just curl up on the ledge with my box of retouched photos and reminisce about rehab.}
<C>__{woman}
<A>__{tightly wound today, aren't we?}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{i guess. must be the coffee talking. (handing her a fashion magazine) here, read a fashion magazine. feel more insecure about yourself. toni walks through the shop, checks her watch, passes a row of women getting lunch hour nail jobs. brandon's squeezed in among them. only guy there. cotton between his toes post pedicure. hunched and uncomfortable as the women around him discuss boyfriends and relationships.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{... brandon?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{hi.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{i'm toni. walter said you'd stop by.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{nice to meet you. (immediately, re: the pedicure) this was his idea.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{i know.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{he makes all his employees do this?}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{every one.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{how often?}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{once. before they start work.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{weird.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{you think?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{i've never had my nails done before.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{i can see that. (putting his hands in water) strong hands. nice. do you drink?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{no thanks. i'm fine.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{no, do you drink?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{alcohol. are you a drinker?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{i've been pretty focused on staying in shape. i mean a beer once in a while.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{smoke?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{no. toni what about gambling?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{what about it?}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{look, i'm sorry, i'm pressed for time. (stopping work, regarding him) i asked do you bet. are you a bettor?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{no.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{really? why not? brandon meets her gaze. gears turning. she's hitting on him.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{toni, huh? are you here full time?}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{it's my shop, i better be. why don't you gamble?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{well i will tell you, toni. i bet on something once. risked everything i had and lost.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{so?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{i swore i'd never do it again. toni you're sticking to that story? brandon hey, we just met. i sure wouldn't want to start our relationship off by lying.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{well walter could definitely use someone with a little resolve in his life.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{(leaning in) ya know, toni, this is my first time in town. i'm not used to how fast things run around here. i'm wondering if you'd like to have dinner tonight? let's get to know each other without so many people around.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{... he didn't tell you.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{what?}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{brandon, walter and i are married.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{what? walter just said i was meeting a woman. he acted like...}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{walter's got a weird sense of humor. look, he has a big, bright, beautiful spirit, you'll love working for him, but he's held together by meetings. if it has "anonymous" at the end, walter goes. he has to. he also has to be very careful who he let's into his life. in most ways, walter's brilliant but he can be bullshitted and i can't. so he sends 'em over to me before he hires 'em.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{you're kidding me? coming here... the manicure... this was an interview?}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{you're swift.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{how'd i do?}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{except for an illegal forward pass, perfect, flying colors. congratulations. i'm late for my next appointment. toni walks away, glances back, smiles and }
