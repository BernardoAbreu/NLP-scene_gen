<D>__{we've entered the alderaan system.}
<A>__{vader and two stormtroopers enter with princess leia. her hands are bound.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{governor tarkin, i should have expected to find you holding vader's leash. i recognized your foul stench when i was brought on board.}
<C>__{tarkin}
<D>__{charming to the last. you don't know how hard i found it signing the order to terminate your life!}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{i surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself!}
<C>__{tarkin}
<D>__{princess leia, before your execution i would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. no star system will dare oppose the emperor now.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{the more you tighten your grip, tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.}
<C>__{tarkin}
<D>__{not after we demonstrate the power of this station. in a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base, i have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of alderaan.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{no! alderaan is peaceful. we have no weapons. you can't possibly...}
<C>__{tarkin}
<D>__{you would prefer another target? a military target? then name the system!}
<A>__{tarkin waves menacingly toward leia.}
<C>__{tarkin}
<D>__{i grow tired of asking this. so it'll be the last time. where is the rebel base?}
<A>__{leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to alderaan.}
<C>__{leia}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{dantooine.}
<A>__{leia lowers her head.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{they're on dantooine.}
<C>__{tarkin}
<D>__{there. you see lord vader, she can be reasonable.}
<P>__{(addressing motti)}
<D>__{continue with the operation. you may fire when ready.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tarkin}
<D>__{you're far too trusting. dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. but don't worry. we will deal with your rebel friends soon enough.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{no!}
