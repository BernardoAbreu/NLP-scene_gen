<A>__{in the corner of the room, huddled, chained to the floor, is steph. she does not look good. in fact she looks very sick. there are tubes coming off her arm. freddy stoops down and begins to check the tubes running from her arm. there are small taps on the tubes. he turns them on. blood begins to flow from her into a cup that is already stained red. as he turns it off steph shivers, her eyes open. the whites of her eyes are blood red; she is sick. she speaks, weakly.}

<D>__{help me. please, i'm sick. help me.}
<A>__{she reaches for freddy, but he pulls away. freddy's not looking too hot either.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{don't fucking touch me.}
<A>__{he picks up the half filled cup and leaves. steph stares after him. tears welling in her eyes, beginning to shake now, moving against the chains that bind her. but they stay fast.}
