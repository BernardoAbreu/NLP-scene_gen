<A>__{the marines in the crowd are all on their feet, screaming for tommy to end it. the chant starts up again. 15,000 strong. "tommy! tommy! tommy!" frank tries to instruct brendan, but he can't hear him, and he's too overwhelmed. tommy presses brendan against the cage and does the same thing koba did. he lifts him off the ground, carries him on a dead run, and body slams him so hard the cage shakes. then tommy mounts him and starts pounding away again. the horn sounds ending the round, but this time it's brendan who pops up and pushes tommy. tommy shoves him back. rosenthal has to separate them as the crowd roars its approval.}
