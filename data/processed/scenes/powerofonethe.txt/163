<A>__{and stalagmites composed of pure, crystallized calcium carbonate.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{wunderbar.}
<A>__{the whole chamber glistens with an eerie phosphorescence. toward one end of the crystallized room eight stalagmites grown up from the floor cement to form a huge crystal slab some ten feet off the floor. a buttress of stalg mites drip off it forming a natural, if uneven, stairway.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{doc and pk stare at the crystal cave in amazement.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{how many hundreds of thousands of years to make this masterpiece? everything outside can change, p.k. this remains the same. we are in the heart of africa, p.k. the heart of africa.}
<A>__{doc, in his own world of wonderment, wanders down into the cave among the stalactites. pk follows, soon losing sight of doc behind the large crystal columns.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{you know, if a person stayed here for 100,000 years what would be left? crystal. like a crystal mummy. incredible, ja?}
<C>__{pk}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{incredible.}
<A>__{doc's preoccupation with death irks him. he studies a piece of crystal.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{i wish we had brought the camera. think there's enough light to shoot?}
<A>__{doc does not answer.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{doc?}
<A>__{his concern rises. he moves through the maze of crystal, his pace quickening.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{doc?}
<A>__{still no answer. his vision obscured, pk reaches the elevated slab. he clambers up the buttress for a better view. when he reaches the top he stops cold. his pov doc lying on the crystal slab, eyes closed, hands folded on his chest.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{this is not funny.}
<A>__{doc opens his eyes.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{this is incredible! the crystal. you can feel the life go right through you. here.}
<A>__{doc rises.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{come try it.}

<C>__{pk}
<P>__{(short)}
<D>__{no. that's all right. can we go?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{we have only just gotten here. what's the matter, p.k.?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{all day long you've been talking about becoming something else, about dying. you never talked about dying before.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i'm 87 next month. it's natural.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{not to a sixteen year old it's not. it's painful.}
<A>__{doc realizes what pk is saying.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{you are right. i am sorry. sixteen year old ears should only hear life.}
<A>__{doc starts to whistle "the marriage of figaro" by mozart. the resonance of the whistling off the crystal sounds beautiful, exotic. doc beckons pk to join in with him. pk does so, hesitantly. then pleased with the sound and the feeling, more fully. doc and pk exit through the stalactites, whistling.}
