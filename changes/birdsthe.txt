<ACTION>__{: FULL SHOT - GRANT STREET - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY It is mid-afternoon, and there is a tempo and pace to the people walking, the doorman HOOTING for taxicabs, the policemen directing traffic. PAN SHOT - PEDESTRIANS waiting at street corner for light to change. CLOSE SHOT - MAN at the end of line of pedestrians. He is looking up at the sky. TWO SHOT - MAN AND WOMAN NEXT TO HIM as she follows his gaze upward. LONG SHOT - THE SKY with hundreds of gulls in it, wheeling. MED. SHOT - THE STREET CORNER as the light changes and people begin to cross. In the crowd walking the other way, a man turns to look up at the wheeling gulls in the sky overhead. The CAMERA LOCATES: MED. SHOT - MELANIE DANIELS in the crowd of pedestrians, approaching Davidson's Pet Shop. She is a young woman in her mid-twenties, sleekly groomed, exquisitely dressed, though hatless. She walks with the quick sureness of the city dweller, a purposefulness in her stride, a mischievous grin on her face. She continues toward the front door of a pet shop and enters.}
<LOC>__{INT. BIRD SHOP - MED. SHOT}
<ACTION>__{Melanie opens the door and comes through, still looking back toward the street and skywards. The proprietor, a MRS. MacGRUDER, comes toward her.}

<DIAL>__{Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(shaking her head)}
<DIAL>__{There must be a storm at sea. That can drive them inland, you know.}
<ACTION>__{They are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird department now. The BARKING of the dog SEGUES into the clamor of innumerable birds, TWEETING, TWITTERING, CAWING as Melanie and Mrs. MacGruder go to the counter at the far end. There is a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls are lined with wire-mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so that the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained birds to be sure. The birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic birds, small splashes of color behind the wire-mesh cages, larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets in the bigger cages. As they walk:}

<DIAL>__{You said three o'clock.}
<CHAR>__{MRS. MACGRUDER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I know. Oh, I know.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(she is more distressed now)}
<DIAL>__{I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...}
<CHAR>__{MELANIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?}
<CHAR>__{MRS. MACGRUDER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.}
<CHAR>__{MELANIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And he'll talk?}
<CHAR>__{MRS. MACGRUDER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.}

<DIAL>__{Yes.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(pause)}
<DIAL>__{Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(pause)}
<DIAL>__{Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?}
<CHAR>__{MELANIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(judiciously)}

<CHAR>__{MRS. MACGRUDER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?}
<CHAR>__{MELANIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(with a resigned sigh)}
<DIAL>__{Well, all right, but...}
<ACTION>__{She scurries out behind the counter and out of sight. Melanie finishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the counter. She taps her teeth with the pencil.}
<CHAR>__{MRS. MACGRUDER } <CHAR_PAR>__{(O.S.)}
<DIAL>__{Hello, this is Betty MacGruder at Davidson's.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(pause; accusingly)}
<DIAL>__{It's past three, you know.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(pause)}
<DIAL>__{Well, how long do you think...? All right, would you check it please? Yes, I'll wait.}
<ACTION>__{Melanie sighs. Leaving her gloves and purse on the counter, she begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips with the pencil. There is no menace in the birds surrounding her. They are active and beautiful as they dart behind the bars and mesh of their cages. Off screen, the puppy begins BARKING again as the front door opens. Melanie looks up. MED. SHOT - MITCH BRENNER as he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the steps to the bird department. He is a handsome man, about twenty-nine or thirty, well-dressed, and carrying a felt hat. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE seeing him, and then turning away to bend before the cage of strawberry finches. She pokes the pencil through the mesh. The birds are startled into scarlet flight. TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH as they pass each other in the aisle. He gives a polite little nod, and she gives a polite little smile. But as he passes her, and unknown to her, he turns for a second look -- and then vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner. MED. SHOT - MELANIE looking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of the cage and then comes face to face with Mitch again.}
<CHAR>__{MITCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I wonder if you could help me.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(deliberately, and}
<DIAL>__{with a touch of}
<DIAL_PAR>__{hauteur)}
<DIAL>__{I said I wonder if you could help me.}
<ACTION>__{CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE a trifle annoyed by his manner at first. She is about to inform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl. But then something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea comes to her.}
<CHAR>__{MELANIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(solicitously)}
<DIAL>__{Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?}
<ACTION>__{TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH}
<CHAR>__{MITCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(deadpan)}
<DIAL>__{Lovebirds.}
<CHAR>__{MELANIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Lovebirds, sir?}
<CHAR>__{MITCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?}
<CHAR>__{MELANIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well... yes, sir, there are.}
<CHAR>__{MITCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.}
<CHAR>__{MELANIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I understand completely, sir.}
<CHAR>__{MITCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.}
<CHAR>__{MELANIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(leading him around shop)}
<DIAL>__{No, of course not.}
<CHAR>__{MITCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Do you have a pair that are just friendly?}
<CHAR>__{MELANIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I think so, sir.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(she looks around)}
<DIAL>__{Now then, let me see.}
<CHAR>__{MITCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(at the finches)}
<DIAL>__{Aren't these lovebirds?}
<CHAR>__{MELANIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, sir, those are... redbirds.}
<CHAR>__{MITCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The sign says strawberry finches.}
<CHAR>__{MELANIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(airily)}
<DIAL>__{Yes, we call them that too.}

<DIAL>__{Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...}

<CHAR>__{MITCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Those are canaries, Miss.}

<DIAL>__{Doesn't this make you feel awful?}
<CHAR>__{MELANIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(baffled)}
<DIAL>__{Doesn't what make me...?}
<CHAR>__{MITCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?}
<CHAR>__{MELANIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.}
<CHAR>__{MITCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?}
<CHAR>__{MELANIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.}
<CHAR>__{MITCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.}
<CHAR>__{MELANIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.}
<CHAR>__{MITCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Are they moulting now?}
<CHAR>__{MELANIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Some of them are.}
<CHAR>__{MITCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How can you tell?}
<CHAR>__{MELANIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.}
<ACTION>__{CLOSE SHOT - A CAGED BIRD - MITCH'S P.O.V. The bird is wearing a distinctly hangdog expression.}

<DIAL>__{About those lovebirds, Miss...}
<CHAR>__{MELANIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.}
<CHAR>__{MITCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{She smiles back.}
<CHAR>__{MITCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(he waits)}
<DIAL>__{All right, may I see one, please?}
<ACTION>__{CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE as she realizes she is expected to take one of the canaries out of the cage. She smiles feebly, glances toward the counter where she expects Mrs. MacGruder to reappear momentarily, and then takes a deep breath. She opens the door to the canary cage, and cautiously puts her hand into it.}
<CHAR>__{MELANIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(feebly)}
<DIAL>__{Here, birdie. Here, birdie, birdie.}
<ACTION>__{One of the canaries suddenly flutters out of the cage and into the room. Melanie leaps back, startled.}
<CHAR>__{MELANIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh! Ohhhhh!}
<ACTION>__{FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT as the canary flies frantically about the room, Melanie and Mitch in pursuit. Mrs. MacGruder appears at the counter, finally confronted with the chaos she's been expecting all day.}
<CHAR>__{MRS. MACGRUDER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What is it? Oh! Oh my, one of the birds is loose!}
<ACTION>__{She joins in the chase around the room. The bird flutters up to the ceiling, and then lands on the counter and watches them suspiciously.}
<CHAR>__{MITCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Shhh! Shhhh!}
<ACTION>__{He tiptoes up to the bird, hat in hand. Quickly, he covers the bird with his hat, then reaches under to grab it. CLOSE SHOT - MITCH the canary in his hand.}
<CHAR>__{MELANIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There we are!}
<CHAR>__{MRS. MACGRUDER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.}

<CHAR>__{MITCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We met in court.}

<DIAL>__{We never met in court or anyplace else.}
<CHAR>__{MITCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.}

<DIAL>__{You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...}

He rises, walks into the kitchen to check the back door. It seems all right. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him into the dining room. He stops at the cage with the lovebirds. CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS watching him. Is there menace or innocence in their eyes? He cannot tell. CLOSE SHOT - MITCH looking at the lovebirds in puzzlement. There is suddenly a NEW SOUND offscreen, the splintering of wood, the tearing sound of bigger beaks. Alarmed, he turns. MED. SHOT - MITCH coming into the entry hall. CLOSE SHOT - THE FRONT DOOR The wood is beginning to splinter as the bigger birds outside assail the door. FULL SHOT - MITCH turning quickly, the CAMERA FOLLOWING him into the dining room. He pulls the cloth off the table, begins moving it toward the door. In the entry, he lifts the table on end and piles it against the door. He goes into the kitchen again, CAMERA FOLLOWING. He upends the enamel-topped table, drags it to the back door. He is piling chairs against the table when Melanie COMES IN. She looks at what he is doing with alarm. Mitch looks in the direction of where his mother is and then back to Melanie, with an expression almost of desperation. Both turn back to the barricaded door. The CLAWING and the PECKING fills the void. The noise is a din now, insidious and increasingly more frightening.}
