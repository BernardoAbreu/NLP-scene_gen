<L>__{exterior camp dawn}
<A>__{the sun has risen sharply, soaring out of the ocean. it blinds the eyes of those in the little execution party making their way along the beach. the cross cum scaffold has been erected some way from the camp. most people are attending to their morning chores with one eye on the grim act of justice being carried out along the shore. our view of the hangings will be from the distance of the camp; marionette figures, men dancing on ropes, the form ality of legal death. the priest and the executioners. it takes a while for the people in the camp to become aware of the other observers up on the dunes. three figures stand in full view, boldly, silently, watching the camp and the pantomime at the scaffold. the word passes around the camp. eyes pass between the executions and the tall natives watching. the first man is already dangling on the rope by the time that dom paulo and his officers are discussing the appearance of the natives.}
