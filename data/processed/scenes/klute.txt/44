<L>__{interior church discotheque night}
<A>__{we are in the interior of what was once a church and is now a discotheque. interior is painted purple; the record player stands on the altar over the crowd. pews are massed around the dance floor. stained glass windows are lighted from behind and are circled with light bulbs that flash on and off. for all of its obviously bizarre visual quality, there is a sense of relaxation. it is a late night gathering place of many who belong to the sexual underworld of the city. bree and the other girl advance to a pew. a man sitting there (the other girl's pimp) with a third girl. bree's companion greet him shyly, tenderly: she and bree sit down, join in conversation. pull back slowly other pews, other girls and a few men, the sisterhood to bar area in back (what once must have been the vestibule of the crurch) among the people around the bar, pimps, whores, and a sprinkling of hopeful johns and curiosity seekers. the camera picks a familiar face: cable. he watches bree with a mixture of amusement and contempt. a girl comes over to him and tries to proposition him. they appear to be discussing price. just as she thinks it is set, he walks away.}
