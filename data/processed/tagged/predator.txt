<L>__{exterior outer space}
<A>__{the infinite blackness punctuated by a billion stars. as we slowly descend through the varied shades of blue of the earth's atmosphere, we hear the first strains of a haunting, central american flute, joined by a swelling background of jungle sounds. we descend further, through a lush jungle canopy, backlit by a setting sun.}

<L>__{exterior jungle coastline day (magic hour)}
<A>__{through a collage of shimmering heat waves, a dark, other worldly object drops into view, backlit by the fiery, orange red sphere of a setting tropical sun, heading slowly towards us, floating, as if suspended by the rising heat of the jungle. continuing to approach, the shimmering object resolves into a military assault helicopter, its rotors strobing in the fading sunlight. drawing closer, the sound of powerful turbines, throbbing in the heavy air, becomes dominant, overpowering. guided by colored smoke and landing lights, the chopper looms hard into view, pitching forward and settling to the ground, kicking up a maelstrom of dust and vegetation}
<L>__{2 a interior command post day (magic hour) 2 a}
<A>__{where a man wearing a military uniform watches through the large open windows the helicopter as it continues to approach. before the skids have even touched down he sees the first of the men, dressed in civilian clothes but carrying full combat gear, alight gracefully from the chopper, double timing in close order to one side, the orders shouted by one man lost in the roar of the chopper. the man turns away from the window, to a figure, hidden in the shadows.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{he's here.}
<A>__{he turns back, lowering a bamboo shade, obscuring the window.}
<L>__{2 b exterior helicopter pad night 2 b}
<A>__{on adjoining pads, two other helicopters are visible; in the b.g. can be seen several concrete and thatchwork buildings, a secret command post disguised as a coastal}
<B>__{fishing village.}
<A>__{the post in a flurry of activity, american advisors shouting directions to dozens of latin american soldiers who stand by to assist the landing helicopter and to load equipment into the other choppers. inside the chopper, one man remains, stretched out against the bulkhead, as if asleep. he stirs, sits up, lighting up a cigar. with fatigue showing in his motion, he leans forward, descending to the ground. a jeep pulls to stop, the man swinging casually into the front seat, tossing his gear into the rear. with a lurch the jeep heads out towards the command post. in the doorway two men solemnly watch as the jeep approaches. reaching the command post the man alights from the jeep, heading towards the two men. into the pool of light cast by the fixture above the door steps major alan schaefer, the team leader, 38, an intelligent and intense man. he informally salutes, general h.l. philips, 55, hardened, close cropped graying hair, his nameplate and insignia identifying him as a member of an elite commando unit in the u.s. army. he clasps schaefer warmly on the shoulder.}

<P>__{(with affection)}
<D>__{you're looking well, dutch.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{it's been a long time, general.}
<A>__{they walk up the stairs, entering the palapa, leaving the other man on guard.}
<L>__{interior palapa day}
<A>__{large, two room concrete floor, thatched walls and roof. behind a partially drawn curtain in the kitchen, a naked lightbulb hung from the rafters illuminates a bank of compact field radio equipment, maps and aerial photographs. otherwise the rooms are primitive and stand out in stark contrast to this high tech invasion. philips and schaefer enter the room.}
<C>__{philips}
<P>__{(growing serious)}
<D>__{we've got a real problem here, something right up your alley.}
<A>__{they cross to the center of the room to a folding table, covered with a large topographical map of the central american highland jungle. philips leans over the table, circling a set of coordinates and a mark on the open map.}
<C>__{philips}
<D>__{eighteen hours ago i was informed that one of our choppers, transporting three presidential cabinet members from this charming little country, was shot down...}

<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{that's over the border, general.}
<C>__{philips}
<P>__{(dead serious)}
<D>__{that's the problem. apparently they strayed off course.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{we're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.}

<C>__{schaefer}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{what have you got in mind, general.}
<C>__{philips}
<D>__{we figure we've got less than twenty four hours to catch up with them. after that, there's not much hope. we want a rescue operation mounted tonight. that doesn't give you much time.}
<A>__{another puff on the cigar.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{what else it new? when do we leave?}
<A>__{philips looks at his watch.}
<C>__{philips}
<D>__{you lift off in three hours.}

<D>__{there's one other thing.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{what's that, general?}
<C>__{philips}
<D>__{someone else will be going in with you.}
<A>__{schaefer stubbs out his cigar in an ashtray.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{you know we don't work with outsiders, general.}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{who said anything about outsiders, dutch?}
<A>__{schaefer turns, seeing the outline of a figure standing in the doorway of the communications room, holding a sheaf of papers. wearing pressed fatigues, dillon, mid thirties, black, walks into the room. although as rugged looking as the others, his bearing and grooming indicate he's been away from the business of soldiering for sometime. his quick intelligent eyes reveal his current profession.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{last time we danced, it was lieutenant, schaefer.}
<A>__{a grin breaks out across schaefer's face.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{dillon, you son of a bitch.}
<A>__{the two men step forward and simultaneous swing from the hip as it to land a punch...but their hands slap together in a gesture of friendship, their forearms bulging, testing each other's strength.}
<C>__{dillon}
<P>__{(warmly)}
<D>__{how you been, dutch?}
<A>__{they continue the contest, schaefer has the edge, forcing dillon's arm slowly downward.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{you've been pushing too many pencils, dillon. had enough?}
<C>__{dillon}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{no way, old buddy.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{you never did know when to quit.}
<A>__{they look into each other's faces, each remembering something from the past. a moment's hesitation and they quit the contest. they laugh, dillon slapping schaefer on the shoulder.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{that piece of work you guys pulled off at the berlin embassy last week was really something. blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. beautiful.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{like the old days, dillon.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{also heard that you passed on that little job in libya.}
<A>__{schaefer looks at dillon, quietly considering him.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{wasn't my style. we're a rescue unit, not assassins.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{this must be good. big shot from the cia, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. what's so important?}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. they're about to get squeezed. we can't let that happen. i needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet...no screw ups. i needed the best. the best. so, i pulled a few strings at the state department...and here we are.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{go on.}
<A>__{dillon goes to the map.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{the set up is simple, dutch. one day job. we pick up their trail at the chopper, run 'em down, grab the hostages and bounce back across the border before anyone knows we were there. you've done it a hundred times. nothing out of the ordinary.}
<A>__{schaefer considers this.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{and nothing we can't handle alone.}
<A>__{philips breaks in.}
<C>__{philips}
<D>__{i'm afraid those are your orders, major. once you reach your objective, dillon will evaluate the situation and take charge.}
<A>__{schaefer looks from philips to dillon. he still doesn't like it.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{not to worry, dutch. i haven't lost my edge. they've got a head start on us in some real tough country, otherwise, believe me, it's a piece of cake.}
<C>__{philips}
<D>__{gentlemen, we're losing time.}
<P>__{(to schaefer)}
<D>__{you'd better get your men ready.}

<A>__{a light shower passes through the trees. the sky clears, revealing a lush and exotic foliage. birds are beginning to sing but otherwise, all is silent. the dense growth seems impenetrable, but from a solid wall of undergrowth, a hand appears and signals in a downward motion. as if by magic, the assault team materializes, quietly, cautiously. schaefer makes another gesture and the team moves forward in perfect harmony in point lock step, taking their cue from ramirez, the pointman. schaefer, highly focused and alert to every sound and movement, follows ramirez, as if organically connected.}
<L>__{exterior jungle hillside day}
<A>__{descending the steep mountain slope, the team encounters an even denser growth of jungle, at times moving by instinct, as they are often visually separated. at one point, schaefer checks his compass, flashing some hand signals to ramirez, indicating a new direction. ramirez nods and moves on, schaefer signaling to the rest of the men.}

<A>__{blain, in a defensive position, sweeps the jungle slowly with his mp 5. he steps back and turns, checking, revealing in the b.g. the wreckage of a u.s. army uh 1h helicopter, hanging upside down, twenty feet above the ground, entangled in vines in the heavy capony, badly damaged, rotors bent, its tail section blown away. revised "hunter" 4 21 86 a grappling hook is hurled from the ground, clattering into the cargo hold, hooking the edge of the airframe.}
<L>__{interior helicopter day}
<A>__{ramirez moves cautiously, searching for trip wires, using his knife to check the edges of the seats and door frames. grimly he glances at the two bodies slumped over the controls and then exits, snapping into and rappelling down the rope to the ground. he joins schaefer standing in the f.g. they look up, watching as dillon moves through the cockpit, searching through pockets and compartments. schaefer turns his back to the helicopter.}

<A>__{staggering into the clearing, bleeding severely. the hunter is rapidly losing his camouflage ability, his skin turning a pale green, flexing and pulsing in shock. the glow of light from the energy field reflecting off the spreading apron of blood flowing from his wound. with trembling hands he grasps the arrow and breaks it, pulling the shaft from his neck. he screams in pain.}
<L>__{exterior glen pre dawn}
<A>__{schaefer follows the blood trail, deeper into the incredibly dense vegetation, ripping aside the heavy growth, plunging onward. before him, covering a narrow passageway, is a huge spider web, intricate, four feet across. schaefer starts to sweep aside the web. with a sharp intake of breath, he halts, inches from the wed. something is wrong. examining the web closer he sees not silken threads but a hard and shiny network of hair fine wire: a trap. he backs up, picking up a hefty branch from the ground. he swings the branch with a mighty heave, clenching his teeth in pain. the branch sails end over end into the web impacting the strands. a metallic snap is heard; a high pitches whine and the log is violently severed, the pieces flying in opposite directions with great speed. schaefer runs on, again picking up the blood traces of the fleeing hunter.}
<L>__{exterior hunter's camp}
<A>__{at the edge of the site. he sees the hunter staggering through the foliage. schaefer starts after him but then stops, dumbfounded by the incredible images that crash in on him: translucent human skins stretched over frames, the hair of the attached scalps moving lightly in the wind; skinned bodies, some lying on the ground, others hung from the trees, like hopper and his men were. he turns back, seeing the hunter as he passes through the shimmering distortion of a forcefield enveloping the forest. within the force field he sees the vague, nearly transparent outline of the hunter's ship. he approaches it, wide eyed, his senses reeling with astonishment and rage. from within the force field, a passage way of blue light appears, the hunter's form backlit as he ascends the ramp to his spacecraft.}

<A>__{in his weakened condition staggers forward, looking up, seeing the passage way of light diminish as the door begins to close. as rising heat waves begin to envelope the ship, the hunter stares out at schaefer, the heat waves increasing as the keening whine of the ship's drive builds. he enters the force field, the door now inches from closing. on the ground, nearly obscured by the grass and leaves, schaefer sees the hunter's weapon, lying where he dropped it in his desperate flight to escape. schaefer grabs up the weapon and holds it. how the hell does it work?...he squeezes the handle of the weapon feeling it resist. nothing happens. with the last ounce of his strength, and with a bellow of rage, his arm muscles bulging, he crushes down on the handle... in a flash of blue white light, the weapon becomes}
