<D>__{yes. you go ahead.}
<A>__{peggy and richard head onto the crowded floor, and begin to dance.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{the only time people like dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. that guy, doug snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a foureyed worm.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{well, you showed them. you're rich and famous and successful. and you have a beautiful wife.}

<C>__{richard}
<D>__{i guess part of us never really leaves high school.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{you know, i never told anybody this, but i always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.}
<A>__{camera pulls back slowly as peggy and richard become part of the sea of dancers, all lost in nostalgic reverie.}
<B>__{by door}

<C>__{terry}
<D>__{here comes the life of the party.}
<C>__{leon.}
<D>__{i knew you couldn't stay away.}
<A>__{everyone's happy to see charlie. his eyes meet peggy's he gives her a tentative, sheepish wave. terry looks at the band.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{you know, they could've at least asked us to sing. we'd refuse, of course, but they could've asked us.}

<D>__{hello. can i have your attention, please.}
<A>__{the buzz in the room dims, peggy and richard head back to their table.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i know it's getting kind of late, and some of you have a long drive home, so the reunion committee decided it was time for the moment you've all been waiting for. you don't know what you've been waiting for because we didn't tell you, but the committee has selected a king and queen. now don't worry, i took care of it so the band's gonna keep playing for at least another hour, and my old pal judge crystal said that the bar can stay open as long as we want.}
<A>__{everyone applauds.}
<B>__{view on peggy and charlie}
<A>__{at opposite ends of the reunion, but aware of each other.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{and while you're at it, let's have a nice big hand for the little lady that did such a great job supervising all the decorations, rosalie testa.}
<A>__{more applause. view on rosalie in her wheelchair.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{now back to business. the members of the committee have given this a lot of thought and decided on the two people who best represent the spirit of buchanan high's class of '60. the king is someone who, in more ways than one, has come a long, long way since he left here.}
<A>__{angle peggy's table they all look to richard, knowing he's the obvious choice.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{we're proud to welcome him back, richard norvik! come on up here, king richard!}
<A>__{the band plays a fanfare and drum roll. richard gets up, and walks to the stage as everyone applauds. the band plays a chorus of "get a job."}

<D>__{sharon and i thank you all for making us feel so welcome. it's good to be back.}
<A>__{more applause as richard steps back.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{every king deserves a queen. now, we had a lot at worthwhile candidates. and i don't want any of you ladies to feel left out, 'cause you're all beautiful. but when we sent out the invitations, we didn't mention anything about this being a costume party.}
<A>__{peggy's embarrassed reaction, realizing everyone's looking at her.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{maybe we should have, 'cause just looking at her brings it all back for us. ladies and gentlemen, i give you our queen, peggy sue kelcher bodell. come on up here, peggy sue.}
<A>__{the band begins the song peggy sue. peggy looks pained. she doesn't move.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{they're waiting. come on.}
<C>__{peggy}
<P>__{(close to tears)}
<D>__{i can't. it's all too much.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{go on. you can do it.}
<A>__{charlie and beth stand together: beth is worried about peggy. camera tracks peggy as she haltingly makes her way to the stage. as she does, she notices another blow up on the wall: peggy and charlie, as king and queen of the 1960 prom. arthur gives the crown to richard who places it on peggy's head. he kisses her cheek and stands back, beaming.}
<C>__{peggy}
<P>__{(into mike, overwhelmed)}
<D>__{thank you.. thank you very much.}
<A>__{the lights dim, leaving peggy in the spotlight. continued applause as the singer steps up to his mike and begins to sing the song peggy sue.}
