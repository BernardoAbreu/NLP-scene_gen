<L>__{exterior east 77th street night (continuous action)}
<A>__{spengler, wearing a hardhat, is jackhammering a hole in the middle of the street. safety cones and reflectors have been set up and a small area is lit by strong work lights.}
<B>__{police car}
<A>__{it turns onto east 77th street, cruises slowly up to the makeshift worksite and stops. the noise of the jackhammer is so loud, spengler doesn't notice the police car and the two cops inside looking at them. finally, he looks up, sees the police car and freezes.}
<C>__{first cop}
<D>__{how ya doing?}
<C>__{spengler}
<P>__{(reeking with guilt)}
<D>__{fine! it's cutting fine now.}
<C>__{first cop}
<P>__{(curious)}
<D>__{why are you cutting?}
<C>__{spengler}
<P>__{(looking for one of the others)}
<D>__{why are we cutting? uh boss!}
<A>__{venkman and stantz arrive just in time wearing con ed hardhats, doing a good imitation of a consolidated edison repairman.}
<C>__{first cop}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(belligerent)}
<D>__{what the hell's it look like we're doing? we're bustin out asses over here 'cause some douchebag downtown ain't got nothin' better to do than make idiots like us work late on a friday night, right?}
<P>__{(looks to spengler for agreement)}
<C>__{spengler}
<P>__{(with a "right on" fist)}
<D>__{yo.}
<A>__{the cops seem satisfied by the explanation.}
<C>__{first cop}
<D>__{okay, boys, take it easy.}
<A>__{they drive off. spengler breathes a great sigh of relief and starts rubbing his sore shoulders.}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{you were supposed to help me with this.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{you need the exercise.}
<A>__{stantz resumes jackhammering, while venkman and spengler clear the rubble from the hole. suddenly he hits metal. they clear away generations of paving material revealing an ornate iron manhole cover. the manhole cover bears a strange logo and the letters nyprr.}
<C>__{stantz}
<P>__{(examing it)}
<D>__{nyprr. what the hell ? help me lift this.}
<A>__{they prey off the iron cover with crowbars, uncovering a very dark and very deep abyss.}
<C>__{stantz}
<P>__{(shining a flashlight into the hole)}
<D>__{wow! it's an old airshaft. it just goes forever.}
<A>__{spengler leans in with the giga meter which is reading even higher now.}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{very intense. we need a deeper reading. somebody has to go down there.}
<A>__{venkman and spengler both look at ray.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{thanks, boys.}
<A>__{they snap stantz into a harness and lower him into the hole on a strong cable attached to a winch. ray calls out orders to them as he descends deeper and deeper.}
<C>__{stantz }
<P>__{(his voice echoing in the airshaft)}
<D>__{keep going more more }
