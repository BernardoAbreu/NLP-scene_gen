<A>__{the millennium falcon, zooming through the monster's mouth, rolls on its side and barely makes it between two of the gigantic white teeth before the huge jaws slams closed.}
<L>__{exterior cave entrance giant asteroid}
<A>__{the enormous space slug moves its head out of the cave as the falcon flies out of its mouth. the monster tilts its head, watching the starship fly away.}

<A>__{with yoda strapped to his back, luke climbs up one of the many thick vines that grow in the swamp. panting heavily, he continues his course climbing, flipping through the air, jumping over roots, and racing in and out of the heavy ground fog.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{run! yes. a jedi's strength flows from the force. but beware of the dark side. anger... fear... aggression. the dark side of the force are they. easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. if once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did obi wan's apprentice.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{vader. is the dark side stronger?}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{no... no... no. quicker, easier, more seductive.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{but how am i to know the good side from the bad?}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{you will know. when you are calm, at peace. passive. a jedi uses the force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{but tell me why i can't...}
<C>__{yoda}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{no, no, there is no why. nothing more will i teach you today. clear your mind of questions. mmm. mmmmmmmm.}
<A>__{artoo beeps in the distance as luke lets yoda down to the ground. breathing heavily, he takes his shirt from a nearby tree branch and pulls it on. he turns to see a huge, dead, black tree, its base surrounded by a few feet of water. giant, twisted roots form a dark and sinister cave on one side. luke stares at the tree, trembling.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{there's something not right here.}
<A>__{yoda sits on a large root, poking his gimer stick into the dirt.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i feel cold, death.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{that place... is strong with the dark side of the force. a domain of evil it is. in you must go.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what's in there?}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{only what you take with you.}
<A>__{luke looks warily between the tree and yoda. he starts to strap on his weapon belt.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{your weapons... you will not need them.}
<A>__{luke gives the tree a long look, than shakes his head "no." yoda shrugs. luke reaches up to brush aside some hanging vines and enters the tree.}
