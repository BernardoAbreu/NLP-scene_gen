<L>__{interior carr's office waiting room day}
<A>__{whip stands up as the meeting spills into the waiting room. handshakes are exchanged as carr walks to whip and offers his hand to shake.}
<C>__{mr. carr}
<D>__{they tell me you're some kind of pilot.}
<A>__{carr nods, sizing whip up. whip returns the nod as hugh quickly puts a hand on whip's back and leads him away like a heavyweight being returned to his corner after pre fight instructions. the television in whip's living room night we are now in whip's living room watching home movies...}
<C>__{whip's voice}
<D>__{get up! what? you can't get up?!}
<P>__{(whip is laughing...)}
<D>__{c'mon, knuckles whitaker drags himself up and goes long...go.}
<A>__{we watch an 8 year old will whitaker run long as the ball flies to him. he catches it and on screen whip hollers.}
<C>__{whip's voice }
<D>__{touchdown whitaker! atta boy! c'mon back. what? come back and do it again. tired? junior, you don't know tired. i'm not going out. you go out. keep running.}
<A>__{we pull away from the screen to find whip who sits on the couch. a large bottle of vodka appears empty amidst many dead beers and an ashtray that overflows. whip moves in drunken slow motion as he attempts to free a cigarette from the pack and light it. he freezes at one point and places his hands straight out in front of himself, a strange, involuntary, drunken reset. his stare is a 1000 miles offshore; he is anywhere but on this planet. oblivion. the light from the headlights of a car in the driveway wash across the walls of the living room. we hear a car door open and women exchange good byes.}
<C>__{sheila }
<D>__{keep coming back, nicole. one day at a time.}
<C>__{nicole }
<D>__{i know, one day at a time.}
<A>__{we hear them laugh as whip still stares in to space.}
