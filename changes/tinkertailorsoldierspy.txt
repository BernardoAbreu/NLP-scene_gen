<ACTION>__{Budapest skyline, looking towards the Parliament building. From here the world looks serene, peaceful. Then, as we begin to PULL BACK, we hear a faint whine, increasing in volume, until it's the roar of two MiG jet fighters, cutting across the skyline. The PULL BACK reveals a YOUNG BOY watching the jets, exclaiming excitedly in Hungarian.}
<LOC>__{EXT. BUDAPEST STREET - DAY}
<ACTION>__{LATERALLY TRACKING down a bustling street, as the jets scream by overhead. Pedestrians look up. All except one man who continues walking. This is JIM PRIDEAUX. ACROSS THE STREET: More pedestrians. We're not sure who we're supposed to be looking at - the short stocky man? The girl in the mini skirt? The man in the checked jacket? A car driving beside Prideaux accelerates out of the frame. Across the street the girl in the mini-skirt peels off into a shop. The stocky man turns and waves to us. But it isn't Prideaux he's greeting but another passerby, who walks over, shakes hands. Now we're left with Prideaux and the Magyar in the checked shirt, neither paying any attention to each other. Just as we are wondering if there is any connection, the two reach a corner and the Magyar, pausing to cross the road, collides with another passerby. He looks over and sees Prideaux has caught the moment of slight clumsiness and gives the smallest of rueful smiles. A tiny moment of contact between the two. Then both men walk on around the corner, just two strangers headed in the same direction...}

<LOC>__{INT. BUDAPEST - GALERIA - DAY}
<ACTION>__{A formerly grand arcade. Many of the shops are now closed, the one's that are open don't have much to sell. A CAFE occupies the middle space under the high vaulted ceiling. A JAZZ ROCK band rehearses in one of the nearby disused shops, incongruous in the window, music muffled by the glass. Customers sit around tables playing chess, drinking coffee, a mother breast-feeding, the hum of chatter. The ordinary world. We find Prideaux and the Magyar sitting at one of the tables.}

A WAITER arrives, belly bulging   out of his grubby shirt, hair plastered to his head. He   puts two wizened-looking sandwiches in front of them. PRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. - A DROP OF SWEAT trickles from the Waiter's face, drips onto the table top. The Magyar catches Jim looking at the droplet and gives a wry smile - "nice service." Jim smiles back but a bell has begun to ring inside him.}

He looks around the Galeria again, looking low - checking the feet of the other customers? Then raising his gaze, he checks the windows of the apartments above which look down into the arcade. PRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. - An OLD WOMAN stands in the shadows by a window above. She is watching him. Catching his gaze she shrinks back into the darkness and disappears. Prideaux's expression doesn't change but he sets his coffee cup down and casually stands. The Magyar looks up in surprise.}

<DIAL>__{Would you excuse me a moment?}
<ACTION>__{He starts to walk towards the exit of the Galeria. Behind him his chair teeters for a moment, then slowly falls back and lands with a CRASH, sending pigeons fluttering up to the domed ceiling. The WAITER starts, turns, sees Prideaux leaving. Panic flashes across his face, he draws a GUN from the back of his belt, aims after Prideaux and FIRES - the shot echoing in the cavernous space. The shot misses, RICOCHETING off the tiled wall and Prideaux keeps walking, fighting down the impulse to run, as behind him, out of focus - an image from a surreal NIGHTMARE: the other CUSTOMERS stop what they are doing, like actors at the end of a scene, and begin to rise, some drawing guns. We hear a muffled voice shouting distantly in Russian.}

Through the cafe window we can see a MAN, partly obscured by the crowd in front of us, the only man still seated. He lights a cigarette. CLOSE ON THE LIGHTER as he replaces it. We can make out an inscription: "To George, from Ann. All my love." In the Galeria the KGB Man continues to bellow at the Waiter. The baby begins to WAIL.}

<ACTION>__{A long conference table. We are looking at an ELDERLY MAN at the head of the table. He's sitting on a rather ornate carving chair - a little like a throne - and he looks ill. He is signing documents, his signature a simple "C," scrawled in GREEN INK, aware all eyes are on him. A cigarette burns away in an already loaded ashtray. This is the head of the Circus - known as CONTROL. Around him are four lieutenants - the inner circle of the intelligence service - PERCY ALLELINE, TOBY ESTERHASE, ROY BLAND and BILL HAYDON. Beside him, his right-hand man - GEORGE SMILEY. From the thick and embarrassed atmosphere we might guess we are at the end of a coup, the final ousting of a King. All we hear is the ticking of a loud clock and the scratch of the pen. Smiley looks up to find Alleline's gaze fixed on him. Alleline quickly looks down at his hands. CLOSE ON SMILEY - as he examines the others, gauging the SHIFT OF POWER occurring in the room. - Bill Haydon - handsome, urbane, frowning with tension, pulls on his cigarette. - Roy Bland - heavy set and moustached, flicking a guilty look up at Smiley and away. - Toby Esterhase - immaculate hair and suit, eyes on Alleline, watching for a cue, like a dog told to `stay'. No-one will look at him. ON SMILEY - realising there is no hope. Control finishes, puts the pen back in his pocket. He hands the file to the MOTHER who, red-eyed, walks with it out of the room.}

Smiley puts his hand on it, but doesn't right it, listening to something from somewhere inside the house. A faint movement. Through the HALF OPEN KITCHEN DOOR we catch a glimpse of a WOMAN beyond. ANN is back. Smiley stands with his back to us, still in his coat, staring through the door at his wife beyond. Something of a Vermeer in the image. He's absorbing the different atmosphere - home. Deciding whether to go in. Or not. Suddenly we hear MUSIC - JULIO IGLESIAS, singing a disco version of LA MER - very seventies.}

The MUSIC continues as we find... CONTROL and SMILEY ...sitting a little apart, talking. Haydon is still working his way through the party... We PASS PERCY ALLELINE and his DRUNK WIFE. Alleline looking fretful and hoping no-one is noticing the scene she is making... Haydon grins at all his comrades, feeling fond of everyone, but heads on to his destination... PRIDEAUX sits watching him come with a drink towards him, shakes his head, but can't help but smile fondly at the idiot Haydon is prepared to make of himself...}
