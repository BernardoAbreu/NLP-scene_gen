<D>__{may the valkyries welcome you, and lead you through odin's great battlefield. may they sing your name with love and fury, so that we might hear it rise from the heights of valhalla... and know that you've taken your rightful place at the table of kings.}
<A>__{bows and pitch dipped arrows are gathered from the battlefield. gobber hands a set to hiccup, meeting his eyes with sympathetic glance.}
<C>__{gobber }
<D>__{for a great man has fallen. a warrior. a chieftain. a father. a friend.}
<A>__{hiccup dips his arrowhead in a smoldering chunk of wreckage, igniting the pitch that coats the tip. he releases his arrow, which sails through the air and lands on the deck of the ship, where stoick is laid out on a pyre, covered by a sail, his axe upon his chest. the others follow hiccup's lead. they draw back in unison and loose their arrows, filling the sky with crisscrossing, flaming streaks. they arc over the lagoon and set the ship alight. on hiccup, fighting back emotion and losing the battle.}

<D>__{i'm sorry, dad.}
<A>__{he eyes the engulfed ship.}

<D>__{you have the heart of a chief and the soul of a dragon. only you can bring our worlds together. that is who you are, son.}
<A>__{hiccup meets her bolstering stare. he turns to the ship and watches it in silence, silhouetted in its glow.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{i was so afraid of becoming my dad. mostly because i thought i never could. how do you become someone that great? that brave? that selfless?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i guess you can only try.}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{a chief protects his own. we're going back.}
