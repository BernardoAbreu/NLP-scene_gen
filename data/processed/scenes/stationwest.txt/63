<L>__{exterior camp office day}
<A>__{as two men who have snagged the horses now take off the gold bags. in front of the office pete, the camp boss, ben and sam, two tough looking accomplices, stand watching and glancing up the road down which the horses came. there is a frown on pete's face.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{where's joe?}
<P>__{(as pete doesn't answer)}
<D>__{something's gone wrong, pete.}
<A>__{pete looks thoughtfully at joe's horse, pats his neck, again locks up the road.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i know one thing. he was born on a horse and he didn't just fall off this one... go and take a look.}
<A>__{two men mount and start away. close shot of haven. as he moves back out of sight. obviously he can't move into the camp now. glancing off down the valley he sees in the distance a work wagon approaching. it is still hidden from sight of the sawmill by high ground between. he puts his horse down the slope towards the approaching wagon, at a tangent to the camp.}
