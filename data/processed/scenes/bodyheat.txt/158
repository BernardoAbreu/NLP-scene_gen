<D>__{everything's in order up to there. the problem comes in the language of the bequest to heather. it's a technical matter. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{hardin }
<D>__{in writing the will, i'm afraid mr. racine violated what's known as "the rule against perpetuities.}
<A>__{hardin watches racine, who reacts minutely.}
<C>__{hardin}
<D>__{it's a small thing, but it's the law. it forbids an inheritance to be passed down indefinitely for generations. many general practitioner lawyers don't fully understand it. it doesn't come up much for them, because wills this complex are usually handled by estate departments in larger firms. handled by lawyers who specialize in this type of work.}
<A>__{matty turns a confused look to roz who returns it sympathetically. hardin notes it.}
<C>__{hardin}
<D>__{i know this is terribly confusing, but if you'll bear with me... i spotted the problem right away, but since edmund's intent was clear, i thought it in everyone's best interest to try and get the will admitted into probate anyway, even though it was technically incorrect. i knew that a probate judge in miami would spot the mistake right away. that's all they do all day, they're expert. so i thought i'd bring it up here to okeelanta county since edmund had the residence here and see if i could get lucky with a judge who didn't know estate law quite so well...}

<D>__{perhaps find one with the same kind of training as mr. racine.}
<A>__{racine watches him, his mind racing ahead too fast to bother being insulted. lowenstein can't help a small, wincing smile. now hardin gets to his payoff and there is no amusement in his tone.}
<C>__{hardin}
<D>__{unfortunately, my plan backfired. i ran into a judge who'd had other dealings with mr. racine. a judge costanza. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{hardin }
<D>__{in fact, it seems there were problems with an estate in a case four years ago. very different problems, it's true. but on a will mr. racine prepared. it was quite a mess. accusations of carelessness, a malpractice suit...}

<D>__{i think he called it the gourson case?}
<A>__{racine watches him dully, then concentrates on taking out a cigarette.}
<C>__{roz}
<D>__{once again, mr. hardin, you've lost me.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{yes, what does all this mean?}
<C>__{hardin}
<D>__{it means, i'm afraid, that edmund's will is invalid. edmund walker died interstate, as though there were no will at all.}
<A>__{roz looks at matty with panicky eyes.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{so... what happens now?}
<A>__{hardin looks her over coldly. he doesn't believe she doesn't know,}
<C>__{hardin}
<D>__{you don't know?}
<C>__{matty}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{no, i don't.}
<C>__{hardin}
<D>__{perhaps mr. racine would like to tell you.}
<A>__{racine is recovering. he gives hardin a quick, ugly look, then turns toward matty, and speaks quietly.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{in the state of florida, when a person dies without a will, and there are no children and no surviving parents, then the spouse inherits everything.}
<A>__{it seems to take a long moment for matty to fully digest this. it takes not quite as long for roz.}
<D>__{converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<A>__{her face goes through several transformations: confusion to disbelief to despair, then on in the direction of outrage. lowenstein's eyes are flashing around at the faces. he seems genuinely amused.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{my god. you mean... it's all mine?}
<A>__{hardin is an unconvinced audience. he nods.}
<C>__{hardin}
<D>__{though that was clearly not your husband's intention.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{my god.}
<C>__{hardin}
<D>__{he intended heather to benefit }
<C>__{matty}
<P>__{(looking between hardin and roz)}
<D>__{of course, of course, i understand. of course.}
<C>__{hardin}
<D>__{as you can imagine, mrs. walkers given the circumstances of edmund's death, none of this is going to happen... how should i say it... simply.}
<A>__{matty seems still in shook.}
