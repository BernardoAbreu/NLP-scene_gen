<D>__{yeah, let's have a look.}
<A>__{taarna slowly stands up, pushing their hands away, and takes a step back.}
<D>__{barbarian #2 heey, she's tough. barbarian #3 maybe she wants to fight?}
<A>__{they all laugh.}
<D>__{barbarian #1 ... or maybe she wants to take us}
<A>__{all on? still laughing, they move towards her. in a blinding flash, taarna draws her golden sword, and wielding it like a samurai master, slices off all three of their heads. in an instant, the sword is back in its sheath. the barbarian's heads stop laughing as they fall to the ground. the music stops, and everyone in the bar stares at taarna. stepping over the bodies, taarna walks up to the bartender, pulls out the parchment picture of the glowing mountains, and shows it to him. the bartender looks at it carefully, then points out the window.}
