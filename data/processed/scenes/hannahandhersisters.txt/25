<T>__{cut to:}
<D>__{the stanislavski catering company in action.}
<A>__{sophisticated pop music plays as the film cuts to:}
<L>__{interior loft day}
<A>__{an abstract painting on a wall fills the screen. light laughter is heard, as well as the sophisticated music; offscreen brunch guests chatter indistinctly.}
<C>__{female brunch guest}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{these things are delicious! what in the world are they?}
<A>__{holly walks onto the screen in front of the painting. she holds an almost empty tray of hors d'oeuvres; she wears a uniform.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{oh, um, those are quail eggs.}
<C>__{female brunch guest}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{oh, they're very good.}
<A>__{holly walks past the painting towards the female brunch guest. a man walks in front of her. chatter, light laughter, and music are still heard; a party is in progress.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{yeah, my friend april makes those.}
<P>__{(holding out the tray)}
<D>__{here, try the shrimp puffs. these are delicious.}
<C>__{female brunch guest}
<P>__{(taking one from the tray)}
<D>__{oh, thank you. that looks great.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{i make those.}
<C>__{female brunch guest}
<D>__{mmm. thanks.}
<A>__{holly laughs lightly as she walks away from the woman. holding her tray, she passes a large oval loft window and several clusters of brunch guests. they are eating and drinking. no one pays any attention to her.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(to two male guests in her way)}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{one of the men, murmuring his thanks, takes a last shrimp puff as holly passes.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(to the man)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{holly finally makes her way into the cluttered loft kitchen. her tray is empty.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{the stroganoff is ready.}
<A>__{holly, excited, runs over to april, who is busy taking the stroganoff out of the oven. she wears the same uniform as holly: black skirt, white shirt, and black bowtie.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(animatedly)}
<D>__{we're a big hit.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{oh, in this we're a big hit. yesterday i auditioned for come back little sheba. that, i wasn't such a big hit.}
<A>__{april, holding the stroganoff, dashes out of the kitchen to serve the party guests. holly calls after her, offscreen, as david walks past the hurrying april into the kitchen.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{you will be. you will be. you'll get five jobs next week.}
<A>__{david walks over to holly, who is busy at the pot and pan covered stove.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(to holly)}
<D>__{excuse me, are there any more claims?}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(gesturing at some}
<D>__{canapes warming on}
<P>__{the stove)}
<D>__{only a few. a few.}
<P>__{(chuckling as david takes one)}
<D>__{do you like 'em?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i can't resist.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(busily working at the stove)}
<D>__{really? how flattering! did you try the shrimp puffs?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(eating a canape and pointing at holly)}
<D>__{listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers. something's wrong.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{we're actresses.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{is this your first job?}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(grabbing a quiche from an overhead stove)}
<D>__{really? is the food that bad?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{oh no. not at all.}
<A>__{as holly carries the quiche outside to the party, april comes back into the kitchen from another doorway. music, as well as the chatter of mingling guests, is heard in the background.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{we need more bread and some baked lasa }
<P>__{(realizing holly}
<D>__{isn't there and, at the same time,}
<P>__{noticing david)}
<D>__{uh, lasagne.}
<P>__{(turning to david)}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(standing by the sink}
<D>__{as he wipes his hands}
<P>__{and mouth with a napkin)}
<D>__{i know. you're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(working at the}
<D>__{stove, pointing a}
<P>__{finger for emphasis)}
<D>__{uh, no, the shrimp puffs are holly's. i do the, uh, crepes caviar.}
<A>__{she walks past david to a counter where she begins to fold napkins. david leans back against the sink.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{and the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(turning to david and chuckling)}
<D>__{well, let's hope so.}
<A>__{holly enters the kitchen holding out a plate of clams. she walks over to david.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{here, i stole you a couple of extra clams.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(taking the plate)}
<D>__{ah!}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(looking busily around the room)}
<D>__{now.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(overlapping, gesturing)}
<D>__{incidentally, i'm david tolchin.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(turning to david)}
<D>__{oh, uh, april knox. hi.}
<A>__{they shake hands.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(looking at her)}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(leaving the counter}
<D>__{and squeezing past}
<P>__{david and holly)}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(overlapping, moving out of april's way)}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{april walks offscreen to another area of the kitchen. holly picks up a napkin from the crowded table.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(overlapping holly's apology, turning to her)}
<D>__{you're holly.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(nodding, looking at}
<D>__{david as she wipes}
<P>__{her hands with the napkin)}
<D>__{yeah, we're the stanislavski catering company.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(chewing on a clam canape)}
<D>__{now i'm going to tell you the truth. i really came in here because i was bored stiff by the party.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(laughing, still wiping her hands)}
<D>__{what makes you think we're more interesting?}
<A>__{david walks around the table, putting the plate of clams down on the already crowded surface. holly follows him, chuckling, throwing her napkin into an offscreen garbage can as david stops at a small television set near the doorway. guests in the other room can be seen chatting together in clusters.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(turning on the set)}
<D>__{actually, i'm going to listen to aida, if i'm not getting in your way.}
<A>__{canned laughter and miscellaneous chatter is heard from the television set. david watches the set, still munching on a clam, while holly and april reassure him offscreen.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{no...no. no }
<P>__{(sniffing)}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(offscreen, overlapping)}
<D>__{not at all.}
<A>__{david checks his wristwatch as holly walks over to him.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(gesturing, fiddling with another napkin)}
<D>__{we saw, um, pavarotti, eh, uh, in ernani at the met, and i cried...}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(nodding, his hand}
<D>__{still on his watch as}
<P>__{he looks at holly)}
<D>__{i cry at the opera.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{oh, i i i go limp in the last scene in la traviata. limp.}
<A>__{holly chuckles as david, listening to april, impressed, walks over to her. she is standing by the table.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(nodding, to april)}
<D>__{me, too. i have a private box at the met.}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{i bring my little bottle of wine, i open it, i sit there and i watch and}
<P>__{(glancing over to the offscreen holly)}
<D>__{i cry. it's disgusting.}
<A>__{april chuckles as holly walks back onscreen; she is busy preparing another tray of hors d'oeuvres.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{oh, what, what do you do?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{i'm an architect.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{wha }
<P>__{(turning to glance at holly)}
<D>__{what kind of things do you build?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{are you really interested?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what time do you get off?}
<A>__{the three exchange glances. holly shrugs.}
