<C>__{scarlet}
<D>__{i'm not so sure. i mean look at me. i showed up at a party to drag my son home. could i be any more embarrassing? and how many amazing mothers run their kids' father off?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{hey, you didn't run him off. don't blame yourself for his stupidity.}
<C>__{scarlet}
<D>__{i knew he was unhappy. i knew he hated his job. i should've been more supportive, more sympathetic to what he was going through. he gave up a lot for me.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{that's bull shit! you, maggie and alex are the best thing that ever happened to me... him. he was just too selfish to recognize it. at least, that's how i see it.}

<A>__{scarlet looks into mike's eyes. mike stares back. she's vulnerable. he loves her. it's perfect. mike leans in and}
<C>__{kisses her... passionately.}
<D>__{ssssslap. mike falls off the chair. scarlet leaps up.}
<C>__{scarlet}
<D>__{what do you think you're doing!?}
<A>__{mike scrambles to his feet.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{scar, just calm down. i have something to tell you but i need you to keep an open mind. can you do that for me?}
<C>__{scarlet}
<D>__{this conversation is over, mark.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i'm not mark.}
<C>__{scarlet}
<D>__{i'm not in the mood for games.}

<C>__{mike}
<D>__{it's the truth. i'm the father of your children. you have to believe me.}
<C>__{scarlet}
<D>__{don't ever come near me or my family again. if you do, i will have you arrested or better yet, institutionalized.}
<A>__{scarlet marches towards the house. mike on her heels pleading.}

<D>__{let me explain, scar.}
<A>__{as she passes ed and julie.}
<C>__{scarlet}
<D>__{your son needs a shrink!}
<A>__{scarlet storms off. before mike can protest }
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{pervert!}
<A>__{mike turns. slap. maggie lights him up, runs for the house. slap, slap, slap. the bras add theirs on the way out. alex and nicole march past. mike reaches for alex's arm. alex pulls it away.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{alex, wait. let me explain }
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{how could you do this to me?}
<A>__{alex whisks nicole into the house. mike lowers his head. ed stomps over, grabs mike.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{this place is a disaster! a kid pissed all over my english garden!}
<A>__{what were you thinking!?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{she hates me, ed. i've ruined everything.}
<A>__{mike runs for the house. julie looks quizzically to ed.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{who hates him? what's going on?}
<A>__{ed shifts uncomfortably, takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{oh boy. i don't quite know how to put this.}

<A>__{slap. ed looks like he's about to cry.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{mark's obviously having a crisis and you... you insensitive bastard, you disown him? he'd be better off with his mother in thailand.}
