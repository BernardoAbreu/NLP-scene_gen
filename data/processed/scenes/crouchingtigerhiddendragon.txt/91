<L>__{exterior bamboo forest day}
<A>__{jen runs into a sea of bamboo. she appears to have lost li but is not slowing down. her white clothes are now stained with blood and mud. the wind had picked up and every breeze sounds like an air attack by li. the two leap onto the tips of the bamboo trees and begin their dances and dodges. they glance off bamboos and each other while staying afloat. finally jen lands on the same stick of bamboo as li. the two hold their positions for a while, as the bamboo bends.}

<D>__{i only let you go because i wanted to see the real you.}
<A>__{jen tries to shake li off the bamboo but li recovers nicely.}
<C>__{jen}
<D>__{what do you know about a true heart?}
<A>__{li suddenly leaps off the bamboo tree. the bamboo straightens up and throws jen toward the ground. jen quickly pulls herself up and charges at li. jen chases after li, into a clearing, out of the bamboo forest.}
