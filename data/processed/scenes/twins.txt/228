<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{vince and julius}
<A>__{approach the table. burt and bob open their jackets, revealing they have guns on the girls. morris klane appears behind vince and julius.}
<C>__{burt klane}
<D>__{this has gone way past a simple case of loan deliquency.}
<C>__{bob klane}
<D>__{we don't like getting shot.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{what are you talking about? we didn't shoot anybody.}
<C>__{burt klane}
<D>__{it's no way to do business.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{burt klane}
<D>__{we want to take vince out to the parking lot and kill him.}
<A>__{a long beat.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{that's kind of drastic, don't you think?}
<A>__{morris grabs vince roughly by the arm.}
<C>__{morris klane}
<D>__{let's go.}
<C>__{julius}
<P>__{(ominous)}
<D>__{don't touch him.}
<C>__{burt klane}
<P>__{(suddenly rough)}
<D>__{this is not your problem you don't want me to hurt these lovely ladies, do you?}
<A>__{he pushes his gun into marnie's side.}
<C>__{marnie}
<P>__{(cries out)}
<D>__{ ow!}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{you moved too soon...}
<C>__{burt klane}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{the second rule in a crisis situation:}
<C>__{morris klane}
<P>__{(wary)}
<D>__{he's starting that funny talk again...}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{if you choose to bluff, you must be prepared to have your bluff called.}
<C>__{burt klane}
<D>__{this is no bluff asshole }
<A>__{burt gives a small head signal and two very large men stand up from a nearby table. they each grab one of julius's arms.}
<C>__{burt klane}
<D>__{meet my cousins.}
<P>__{(to the klanes)}
<D>__{get these jerks outside.}
<A>__{just then, so sudden and quick that it's over as soon as it begins, julius double kicks the seated burt and bob in the head. they're out cold before they realize they've been attacked. without stopping, julius whips his arms together in front of him bringing sam and dave into painful contact with each others' head. they, too, are now out cold. vince uses this opportunity to stomp, with all his might, on the toe of morris who's busy watching julius dismantle his relatives. morris screams and lets go of vince, who runs to the nearby pool table, grabs a cue and slams it over the head of the now hobbling morris. all five klanes are out cold.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{how many of those... rules do you have?}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{quite a few. they were formulated by a kendo swordsman in the 17th century, but their philosophical underpinnings can be applied to many other areas of life.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{i bet.}
<A>__{thru thru}
