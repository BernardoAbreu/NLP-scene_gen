<L>__{exterior boreal forest alaska (aerial shot) day}
<A>__{flying. not at the intangible height of a jet, but at spitting distance from the treetops. we're in central alaska, the big lonely, just north of the arctic circle. a thick forest follows the contours of mountain foothills like a deep pile carpet. up at treeline the forest thins to tundra, a grassy scruff turning red and yellow with the coming of autumn. on the horizon, the hills rise to meet the endicott mountains, a great fortress wall of granite so sharp and jagged that snow cannot stick to its face. this is how all north america once looked raw, indomitable. then, abruptly coming into the scene is a colossal etching across the landscape too deliberate to be of natural origin. bisecting this country like a metallic ribbon or a scar, depending on your point of view is the 800 mile long trans alaskan pipeline. even the immensity of the pipeline is rendered insignificant by the vastness of the land. it goes on, and on, and on...}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{a lone man walks along the haul road, a one lane gravel trail running parallel to the pipeline. the weather turns sour rough wind and stinging snow cut across the man's path.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{the man is eric desmond, twenty four, clean shaven, determined. he's clearly out of place here, dressed in a business suit and a light, camel hair topcoat. eric is trying to follow some footprints in the snow a predator's tracks, those of a wolf or coyote. but the footprints ahead have faded, covered by the snow and wind.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{the weather becomes more oppressive. heavy snow, gale winds and sub zero temperatures make his progress tortuous. eric strives stubbornly forward.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{eric has gathered some branches. he tries to make a fire. moisture from his breath has frozen in the upturned collar of his insufficient coat, and his skin is split raw from the cold. his hands are too numb to hold the matches. after several attempts at striking one, he slumps down next to the pile of wood, exhausted and frustrated.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{the snow has covered the pile of branches. eric still sits next to it, partially covered in snow himself.}
<B>__{eric}
<A>__{his face is a death mask: eyes half open and dull, lips a purplish blue, bloodless skin crystallizing as it ices over. the wind howls around him. the snow sticks to his eyelashes and hair without melting.}
<B>__{end dream}
<L>__{interior dark bedroom night}
<A>__{eric bolts up in bed. next to him, anne marie gauvin sits up and hugs him. all that can be seen of her in the dark is a lovely silhouette and a cascade of dark hair. after a moment, eric kisses her. he shakes off the dream and lies back down.}
<L>__{exterior haul road and pipeline close day}
<A>__{a metal sign, peppered with shotgun holes, is posted near a pipeline support piling:}
<B>__{pipeline utility corridor private property no trespassing no hunting no trapping no shooting wider}
<A>__{eric walks quietly past the sign, intent on something ahead of him. although still somewhat boyish in appearance, he's confident and resolute in attitude. his clothes have a distinctly western feel: lucchese boots, levis 501's, mahan cotton shirt. his down parka is unzipped in the sunny, windless, forty degree afternoon. he pauses, then brings to his shoulder a rifle with a four power scope mounted atop it. he peers through the scope. his pov through scope he puts the crosshairs on the shoulder flank of a big, ivory white timber wolf, fifty yards away.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{anne marie stands beside eric, a nikon with a telephoto lens in her hand, holding her breath in anticipation. she's twenty three, pretty, with soft features and piercing blue eyes. she wears eddie bauer woman's gear like she was born in it. eric expertly fixes his aim and slowly squeezes the trigger. but instead of a loud retort, there is only the dull pop of a co2 powered dart gun.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{the tranquilizer dart finds its mark in the wolf's fleshy shoulder. the wolf takes off running, but almost immediately slows, sits, then lies down. eric and anne marie hurry over to the wolf, who is breathing deeply. eric kneels next to him and strokes his thick fur.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{what a beauty.}
<P>__{(to anne marie)}
<D>__{hand me the transmitter.}
<A>__{anne marie passes to eric a tiny, weatherproof homing device attached to a steel collar band. eric puts the collar loosely around the wolf's neck and crimps it in place, all the while talking soothingly to the semi conscious animal. anne marie smiles at eric's tenderness and snaps some photos. with the collar in place and transmitter activated, eric backs away while the wolf tries to rouse itself from its narcosis.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{he's coming around fine.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{be right back. i left my camcorder in the car.}
<B>__{follow anne marie}
<A>__{as she hurries back to their international scout. on the door of the scout is a stylized logo of an oil derrick, under which are the words:}
<B>__{northland petroleum corp.}
<A>__{anne marie opens the hatchback and grabs a video camera.}
<B>__{angle on eric and the wolf}
<A>__{eric smiles as the wolf wobbles tentatively to his feet and trots unsteadily away. near the treeline the wolf turns, glances back at eric and then disappears into the forest.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{anne marie is taping the wolf's retreat. looking through the viewfinder, she crosses a gully between a pipeline piling and a rock formation. eric turns toward her and a glint of light in the debris at her feet catches his eye.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{anne marie! stop!}
<A>__{she glances down. something metal is half buried in the dead leaves and gravel.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{don't move.}
<A>__{eric runs over. he pokes at the object with a stick. with a snap, a steel leg trap chomps the stick in half. anne marie jumps back. eric brushes the dead leaves on the ground behind her and she carefully backtracks out of the gully.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{goddamn trappers!}
<A>__{he angrily rips the trap out of the ground, unearthing several others attached to one another by a long chain.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{takes nerve, laying traplines on restricted land.}
<A>__{eric slips the scope off the dart rifle and climbs up the pipeline on foot pegs to the top of an anchoring pointerior using the scope as a telescope, he scans up and down the haul road.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{he still might be around. i saw fresh tire tracks coming in.}
<A>__{his pov through scope the road and the pipeline stretch toward either horizon, north and south. in the distance, a jeep is parked on the haul road. near it, a man climbs down into another shallow ravine.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{eric hurries down the footpegs.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{man and a jeep, about a mile and a half down.}
<A>__{he jumps into the scout. anne marie stuffs her cameras into the hatchback. as soon as she climbs in, eric tears out.}
<L>__{interior scout (moving shot)}
<A>__{it races along the dusty gravel road at 60 mph.}
<L>__{exterior haul road}
<A>__{startled at the approach of the scout, the trapper uproots his traps and runs out of the ravine. he whistles and another trapper appears nearby.}
<L>__{interior trappers' jeep}
<A>__{they pile into their dilapidated, all terrain jeep. it's oddly well equipped, however. bolted to the dashboard is an expensive tape player and a beat up radio beacon receiver with a round locating screen. they zoom off.}
<L>__{interior scout (moving shot)}
<A>__{eric stomps on the gas. the dust from the jeep obscures his view but he's gaining on them anyway. anne marie hangs on and squints her eyes against the choking dust.}
<L>__{interior trappers' jeep (moving shot)}
<A>__{the driver is lemalle (35), a tall, ugly, rawboned canadian. his entire outfit is made of animal hide. he has long red hair, and a reptilian face usually twisted into a sadistic sneer. while driving, he scans along the pipeline.}
<C>__{lemalle}
<D>__{where the fuck did you drop corbett off?}
<A>__{in the passenger seat, mitchell (38), chews tobacco and looks grim. he's a squat, flat faced okie, with curly matted hair and tired grey eyes. he's dressed in a brown long coat and has a colt .45 peacemaker in a quick draw holster strapped to his leg. despite his intimidating air, confrontation is not his style. he spots a figure up ahead, where the road crosses a muddy creek.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{he's over there.}
<L>__{exterior haul road}
<A>__{turning sharply, the trappers' jeep splashes through the creek bed without slowing. bouncing, it comes down hard against the axle deep bank at the creek's high water mark. lemalle tries to back out, but can't find traction in the mud. eric stops the scout thirty yards behind them.}
<L>__{interior scout}
<A>__{eric opens his door. to anne marie:}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{stay here.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{be careful there're two of them.}
<A>__{eric reaches in the back seat and hands something to anne marie.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{if i unzip my parka, stick this out the window.}
<L>__{exterior haul road}
<A>__{eric confidently approaches the jeep. then, a third trapper climbs from the creek. he's got a line of traps slung around his neck and a world of experience on his face. he's ben corbett, a life long huntsman, somewhere past forty, weathered beyond his years. he has a feral nose, thick beard and dark, smart, hunter's eyes. he wears a hooded cotton sweat shirt, cotton coveralls and vapor barrier mountain boots. on his belt is a holster rig cradling a .44 magnum revolver. eric slows down. he didn't expect to face anyone as formidable as corbett.}
<L>__{interior exterior jeep}
<A>__{emboldened by corbett's presence, lemalle reaches into the back seat and grabs his 6.5 by 55 swedish military carbine.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(to lemalle)}
<D>__{no shooting. let's see who's so interested in us.}
<A>__{corbett has an incongruously affable voice. he throws his traps into the jeep, then strides closer toward eric.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<P>__{(to corbett)}
<D>__{ain't worth it, ben...}
<L>__{exterior haul road creek crossing long shot}
<A>__{as corbett comes closer, eric realizes this might not've been a great idea. corbett squints his eyes and sniffs the air, as if by this he can gauge his opponent's mettle.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{you got two counts against you trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i got your plate number, asshole. maybe you feel like spending a few months in jail.}
<A>__{corbett just smiles. but lemalle, rankled, sticks the carbine out the jeep window. seeing the rifle pointed at him, eric freezes, then slowly unzips his parka.}
<C>__{lemalle}
<D>__{ben? sure you don't want me to drop the fucker?}
<A>__{corbett doesn't answer. then, his eyes narrow and he looks past eric at the scout. corbett's pov the passenger in the scout sticks what looks like another rifle out the window.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{eric quickly glances over his shoulder to make sure anne marie's backing him up.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{you leave and don't come back, that's the end of it.}
<A>__{after a long moment, corbett smiles again, then turns away from eric. he motions lemalle to the front of the jeep. frustrated, lemalle slams back the safety on the carbine and throws it in the back seat.}
<B>__{angle on trappers}
<A>__{mitchell climbs into the jeep and starts the engine. lemalle and corbett rock the jeep back and forth in the rut. while pushing, corbett rips the sole of his boot on a sharp piece of granite. he cusses and pushes harder.}
<L>__{exterior haul road creek crossing}
<A>__{eric walks back to the scout. he feels the trappers' eyes on his back, but forces himself not to hurry. the trappers free their vehicle. corbett gets in the driver's seat, and they take off.}

<A>__{anne marie's hands are shaking as she pulls the plastic tranquilizer rifle back in the window.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<P>__{(unnerved)}

<C>__{eric}
<D>__{bastards took off, though, didn't they?}
<L>__{exterior boreal forest later that day}
<A>__{the trappers have left the flatlands of the haul road area. now their jeep climbs a pathway over the rolling foothills.}

<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{jawing about it won't change it.}

<D>__{then don't look to your left.}
<L>__{exterior sportsmen's camp}
<A>__{a brand new land rover is parked on an alluvial fan in a bend in a small river. scattered about is an assortment of expensive camping gear, beer cans, spent shells and other garbage. three toy macho, vacationing sportsmen are guzzling beer and blasting fish in the shallow river with 12 gauge shotguns. they look up and glower suspiciously as the jeep slows and stops.}
<L>__{interior trappers' jeep}
<A>__{lemalle grabs his carbine.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{leave it here.}

<P>__{(pats mitchell's shoulder)}
<D>__{relax. i just want to ask them how the hunting is.}
<L>__{exterior sportsmen's camp}
<A>__{corbett gets out of the jeep. he regards the sportsmen, their shotguns and their mess with ill concealed contempt. the sportsmen clutch their weapons and watch corbett. he walks around the camp, spotting a rubber lined rucksack stuffed with dead ermine. after a long, tense moment, corbett smiles.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{looks like you've had some luck. where's your guide? sportsman #1 we're on our own, if it's any of your damn business.}
<C>__{corbett}

<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(to sportsmen)}
<D>__{my friend is right. supposed to have a licensed guide when you're on this land, too. sportsman #1 hey, we paid our fuckin' permit fees.}
<A>__{lemalle amuses himself by pissing in their campfire. no one notices that in the b.g., quiet sportsman #3 unzips his parka, exposing a .45 peacemaker in a belt holster.}
<D>__{sportsman #2 i were you, i'd drive right on outta here again. now.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{this was my roaming land, 'til the government took it over. only innuit can hunt here now, and tourists, like you.}
<A>__{corbett swings the rucksack of carcasses onto the hood of the land rover. pissed, sportsmen #1 and #2 step closer to him.}

<D>__{according to tribal law, hunters passing through the land of another tribe can only take game to survive. they can eat the meat, but have to surrender the hides.}

<P>__{(to trappers)}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{as corbett walks to the jeep, he's too angry to notice that he's stepped in a patch of mud under the land rover. near the jeep, lemalle stops and pulls them into a huddle.}

<B>__{lemalle}
<A>__{isn't yet satisfied. he walks back over to the sportsmen, kneeling beside their fallen friend, and crouches right beside them. intimidated, sportsman #2 looks away, but lemalle grabs his chin and turns his face back toward him.}
<C>__{lemalle}
<D>__{think i'm pretty? you better forget how we look, 'cause next time they won't keep me from killing you. this land ain't quite civilized, you know...}
<A>__{he unsheathes his buck knife. below frame, he slices across the forehead of the dead sportsman, peels back his scalp and cuts it loose, indian style. the sportsmen are stunned and sickened. angle on trappers' jeep corbett looks at mitchell and wearily shakes his head.}

<D>__{at least he scalped the dead one.}
<L>__{exterior devil's cauldron dusk}
<A>__{devil's cauldron hot springs is a cluster of twenty tiny dwellings connected by an unpainted boardwalk. the town squats, ugly and temporary looking, in a dirt clearing fifty miles north of the arctic circle. thirty miles east of the pipeline, it's almost dead center of interior alaska. at the edge of town is a gravel airstrip. mixed with the prospector era sod roof cabins are a few prefabricated houses. the boon brought by men building the pipeline is long gone. now only a few itinerant loggers, natives and bush dwellers remain to fight boredom, each other and the depression of the oncoming winter. enough steam escapes from the hot springs to perpetually blanket the valley with fog. the spa is log walled and horseshoe shaped, with partitioned baths inside. facing it are a mud walled fire bath, a wooden steam bath called a maqi, six one room cabins for let, and an unused dance hall. leo meyerling opens the tailgate of a dodge truck with the northland petroleum logo and "district supervisor" on the door. meyerling is short and bald with a completely disreputable face. he staples a poster on a wall. it has a picture of him on it, and:}

<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{glad to see you're okay. i told lemalle not to shoot.}
<P>__{(tries to smile)}
<D>__{had some fine seasons, didn't we...}
<A>__{mitchell's grasp on corbett's coat relaxes as he dies. horrified, eric stares at the man he killed. noticing the scrimshaw lying on the snow where it slipped from mitchell's pocket, corbett picks it up.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(to eric)}
<D>__{fifteen years on the trail with this man, i never saw him rise to anger.}
<A>__{glaring at eric, corbett dips his hand in mitchell's blood, and suddenly smears it across eric's mouth. repelled, eric pulls back.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(continuing; bitterly)}
<D>__{your first kill. how does it taste?}
<A>__{wiping his face, sickened and desolate, eric has no reply.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{then, from somewhere close by, lemalle fires at them. eric stuffs the .357 in his belt and uses a brick to knock the padlock off the back door of the depot. he pushes corbett inside.}
<L>__{interior cargo plane cockpit}
<A>__{the pony tailed, ex hippie pilot shuts his engines off and removes his walkman headphones. hearing lemalle's continuing gunshots, the pilot pulls his door closed and turns on his two way radio.}
<C>__{pilot}
<P>__{(into radio mic)}
<D>__{circle, this is bmy 955. i just touched down in devil's cauldron. nobody's here to greet me like usual, and there's gunfire. i'm getting scarce.}
<A>__{with that, he starts his engines up again.}

<L>__{interior cargo plane cockpit}

<D>__{you can't leave yet.}
<C>__{pilot}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you got to be kidding.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{leave the engines idling. go back and open the side door.}
<A>__{shaking his head and muttering, the pilot unfastens his seat belt, climbs between the two seats to the cargo compartment, and obliges the little lady with the big gun.}
<L>__{interior airstrip depot}
<A>__{the depot, as temporary looking as the rest of devil's cauldron, is a boxcar shaped loading dock and warehouse with a corrugated steel roof. boxes, wood palettes and hand dollies are piled haphazardly about. eric and corbett navigate through the piles of boxes, inching toward the front door the door leading to the plane. suddenly, a string of overhead lights come on. eric goes for the .357, then stops when he sees meyerling, kenai and neff have come in the front door. kenai stomps his feet and shivers. grandstanding for the others, meyerling steps forward.}
<C>__{meyerling}
<D>__{nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?}
<P>__{(no one argues)}
<D>__{that's good. now, eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{meyerling}
<D>__{this isn't your concern. it's over, here and now.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(to meyerling)}
<D>__{sure, when you put a bullet in my back on the way out. easier for all involved.}
<C>__{meyerling}
<D>__{not a bad idea. face it, ben. there's no room in alaska for you any more.}
<A>__{meyerling pokes with his foot at a tipped over rack of eskimo paraphernalia masks, furs, big skin drums, fish and bear spears.}
<C>__{meyerling}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you're as antiquated as this shit.}
<A>__{meyerling moves toward corbett, but eric stands in his way.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{keep back.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{you're quite a piece of work, meyerling. the tide changes, you ride right along with it.}
<A>__{eric looks at neff.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{neff, you know better than this...}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{you're an outsider, mr. desmond. step aside; stay out of it.}
<A>__{kenai and neff move in with meyerling. eric stands his ground and reaches for the .357 in his belt.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{suddenly, lemalle stumbles into the depot, the blankets and furs dragging at his feet. his right side is bathed in blood. half frozen, bled dry, he looks ready to drop down dead. in his left hand, impossibly, he still clutches the massive remington. he hoists it to his hip and grits his teeth as he bolts a round into the chamber with his injured right arm. bracing himself, he levels the rifle at eric. hearing the action of the rifle, eric turns. corbett reaches down, grabs a rusty eskimo spear in both his handcuffed hands, and hurls it. there is a deafening roar as lemalle's rifle discharges. lemalle flies back from the recoil and from the spear stuck clear through his chest. some packing material above eric's head smolders, ignited by the muzzle blast.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{there is a moment of silence. corbett looks at the other weapons near him, and then at meyerling. threatened, meyerling pulls out a .380 automatic. before eric can do anything, meyerling fires. the impact of the bullet throws corbett against some boxes. with a yell, eric jumps meyerling and rips the gun from his grasp. enraged, he pummels meyerling with it until kenai and neff pull them apart. eric wrenches away from them and scrambles to his feet with meyerling's gun in his hand.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{anybody moves and i will shoot!}
<A>__{holding the .380 on them, eric crosses to corbett. bleeding from the abdomen, he's trying to stand up.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{can you walk?}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{wound's a through and through. missed my liver, i think.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{let's get out of here.}
<A>__{cautiously backing away from the others, eric helps corbett get up and shuffle toward the os sound of the cargo plane.}

<D>__{how come you didn't let him shoot me?}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{like i said, i'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{we'll get you to a hospital, soon as we get to fairbanks.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{so they can patch me up and put me in a cage? forget it. meyerling's right i'm a dinosaur. greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land. put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.}
<A>__{he painfully pulls himself into a sitting position.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(continuing; peers out window)}
<D>__{look down there, tell me what any of this matters. struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{you're wrong. everything we do leaves its mark. you said it yourself there are hundred year old footprints in the tundra.}
<A>__{too tired to argue, corbett leans back against the window. he takes mitchell's scrimshaw out of his pocket and looks at it.}
