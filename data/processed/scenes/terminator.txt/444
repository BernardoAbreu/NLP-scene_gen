<L>__{interior motel room later night}
<A>__{tight on sarah and reese in each other's arms. lying across his chest, she surveys his face as his eyes close drowsily.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i bet you're ticklish.}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(uncompre hending)}
<D>__{ticklish?}
<A>__{sarah's hand moves out of frame. after a moment reese looks down, puzzled.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(continuing doggedly)}
<D>__{you'll beg for mercy in a second.}
<A>__{reese seems unperturbed. finally he begins to squirm.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{i don't think i like this.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you're not supposed to.}
<A>__{now reese is becoming desperate. a grimace spreads across his face. it becomes a grin. then he's laughing, trying to escape but she won't let him, and they collapse, laughing together. sarah gazes at his grin, a glimpse of the reese that might have been, in another life. a moment later the grin vanishes at the sound of dogs barking outside. reese is off the bed in an instant, crouched tense, eyes alert. feral as ever.}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{listen to the dogs.}
