<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(disagreeing)}
<D>__{i shouldn't have listened to you, i should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{if i had known i was going to have company, he was right next to me. i think he heard me peeing! i hate that, i am glad he's in jail.}
<A>__{she laughs, he smiles, both attempting to make light of it. but it's hard to make light of; the attempt quickly fades.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{lieutenant garber says when i identify him, they're going to lock him up and throw away the key.}
<A>__{mike nods; buttoning his lip.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i guess i'm supposed to do it in the morning. identify him.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(uneasy)}
<D>__{sooner, the better.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{he said he'd kill me.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{big talk... desperate guy.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{right. how could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key...?}
<A>__{mike is torn.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{it's the right thing to do. identifying him.}
<A>__{she starts to walk away.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{claire?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{hmm...}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(holds up a book)}
<D>__{you wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in india, do you?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{urdu and hindi.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{yeah, what a woman.}
<A>__{he marks it in his crosswords: she moves closer,leaning over his shoulder to see.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{didn't do very well, did you?}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(a laugh)}
<D>__{nope... never finished one yet. i hate these things.}

<C>__{claire}
<D>__{you know why they're like that...? he was myopic... going blind.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{no kidding.}
<A>__{in the silence that follows, their eyes on each other, appraising.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{so, this could be your last night, huh?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{could be, i guess.}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(a thought)}
