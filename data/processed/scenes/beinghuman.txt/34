<A>__{hector and lucinnius are in his study. lucinnius is busy clearing up his papers. he is less hysterical than in the previous scene, more aware of the reality of what he has to do.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{we'll do it with a knife, hector. when everyone has gone to bed. the two of us, to the end...}

<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i don't know what you mean. what mess?}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{you don't understand do you? i'm asking you to die with me... you're my closest, my dearest slave... what would they say about me if you refused to die with me? this is honor... we're choosing death... we're not going to submit to the humiliations that cyprian can heap on us, are we?}
