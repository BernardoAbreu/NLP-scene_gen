<L>__{ext night urban terrace}
<A>__{a row of rundown terrace houses. some are boarded up. not all the street lights work. those that do cast shadows of parked vehicles glistening in the rain. a front door opens and don appears with rubbish which he puts in a bin. he hears something and looks up to see four big horses pulling a hulking great wagon down the middle of the street. the wagon is a gigantic windowless box. the horses are harnessed and there are reins but no sign of a driver. it's a very weird sight. don, unable to take his eyes off this amazing apparition shouts back into the house from where light from a tv flickers.}
