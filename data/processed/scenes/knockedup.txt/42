<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i had a vision for how my life would go and this definitely is not it.}

<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i am kinda living my vision, yeah.}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{well, that is sad, i'm telling you. life doesn't care about your vision. okay?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{stuff happens. you just got to deal with it. roll with it. that's the beauty of it all. knocked up 46.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i just don't get how i tell the kid not to do drugs when i do drugs. i will feel like a hypocrite.}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{well you remember what i told you? when you were a teenager?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{i said, "no pill, no powders."}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{that's right, that's right.}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{right. if it grows in the ground, it's probably okay.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i guess it worked. you told me not to smoke pot all those years. and then i found out you were smoking pot that whole time.}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{not the whole time. just in the evenings and all day every weekend. not that much.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{honestly, though, when you look at me, do you not think at all, like, you know, if he just never existed, i would have avoided a massive heap of trouble? you know?}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{absolutely not. i love you totally and completely. you're the best thing that ever happened to me.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm the best thing that ever happened to you?}
<C>__{harris}
