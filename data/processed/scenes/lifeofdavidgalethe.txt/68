<A>__{bitsey sits in front of david. he's less animated than the day before, drained. he rubs his wrists. they are speaking in hushed tones. a beat.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{off the record?}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{alright, we're off.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{constance was murdered with what's called the securitat method. you're hand cuffed, forced to swallow the key, taped at the mouth, a bag's sealed over your head and you're left to suffocate. the securitat did this to romanians who wouldn't inform or confess. sometimes the bag was ripped off at the last second, you got a second chance. if not, you die knowing the 'key' to your freedom was inside you the whole time. a cheap but effective metonym. problem is i mentioned the method in an early article. the prosecution never knew.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{you're telling me someone's framing you?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's more than that.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{there was a tripod.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{right, facing her body. are we on?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(nods agreement)}
<D>__{not a single print was found on it. someone brought it, wiped it, left it. why? it's as if they wanted me to know that somewhere there's a record of what really happened that afternoon. as if they wanted me to die knowing the key to my freedom was... out there.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{maybe you're being paranoid?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{ms. bloom. i'm an anti death row activist on death row. doesn't that strike you as odd?}
<A>__{a beat. she nods.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{any ideas who 'they' are?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{but i have someone on it, someone i'm hoping will one day find an answer.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{belyeu's hired a detective?}
<A>__{he shakes his head.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{a journalist.}
<A>__{it takes bitsey a second to understand. david smiles.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(mimicking belyeu)}
<D>__{'she's a smart one.'}
<B>__{accelerated rotating zoom out to long shot.}
