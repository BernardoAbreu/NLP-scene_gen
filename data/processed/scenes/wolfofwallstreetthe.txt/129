<L>__{interior stratton oakmont iii bullpen day (feb `95)}
<A>__{bustling with activity. with jordan and donnie looking on from nearby, steve madden approaches a microphone on the raised platform, in his hands several shoe boxes.}
<C>__{steve madden}
<P>__{(into mic)}
<D>__{uhhh... excuse me...}
<A>__{the place slowly comes to order.}
<C>__{steve madden }
<D>__{for those of you who don't know me, my name is steve madden. i'm }
<C>__{one broker}
<D>__{we know who you are!}
<A>__{steve clears his throat, looks over at jordan he's terrified. jordan motions for him to calm down.}
<C>__{steve madden}
<D>__{i uh, i'd like to start by telling you about my background in the shoe industry.}
<C>__{another broker}
<D>__{nice fucking hat!}
<C>__{steve madden}
<D>__{i uh... first started working in the shoe industry, in a shoe store. when i was sixteen, my friends were out chasing girls, but i was learning about women's shoes.}
<C>__{kalil peter deblasio}
<A>__{move the mike closer. we can't fucking hear you! he moves the mic; feedback screeches through the bullpen.}
<C>__{steve madden }
<D>__{sorry... anyway, my first job was at a shoe store like i said where i worked in the stockroom. you know, i can honestly say i've been a lover of women's shoes since i was twelve broker #4 freak!}
<C>__{steve madden}
<D>__{no. heh heh. not like that. i mean somehow i became fascinated with the endless design possibilities for women's shoes broker #5 broker #6 queer! get a fucking life!}
<A>__{boos, hisses. steve looks at jordan, who motions for him to speed up. he grabs a shoe from one of the boxes.}
<C>__{steve madden }
<D>__{this shoe the mary lou is the one that really put me on the map. it's a black patent leather variation of the mary jane, but }
<A>__{splat! a half eaten grapefruit lands at steve's feet. in a flash, jordan rushes over, grabs the mic }
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{all right, let's hear it for steve madden and the wonderful mary lou!}
<A>__{huge applause, with stomping feet; howling, etc.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{okay, now that you got that out of your system, i want you to know why steve is so completely off the fucking wall... it's because this man is a creative genius. steve's power, his gift is that he creates trends. artists like steve come along once a century! elvis! andy warhol! giorgio armani! who knows how high this stock could go? the 20s? the 50s? the 80s?}
<A>__{applause; war whoops. jordan motions for quiet.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{i want everybody to look down. see that little black box in front of you? it's called a telephone. now i'm gonna let you in on a little secret about this telephone it won't dial itself! that's right until you take some action, it's nothing more than a worthless hunk of plastic, like a loaded m16 without a trained marine to pull the trigger. and in the case of the telephone, it's the action of you, a highly trained strattonite, a killer who will not take no for an answer! a person who will not hang up the phone until his client either buys or fucking dies!}
<A>__{the brokers go crazy. jordan looks around.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{i don't care if you graduated from harvard or bumfuck university or never got past fourth fucking grade! that phone is the great equalizer!}
<P>__{(pause; looks around)}
<D>__{there is no nobility in poverty. i've been rich, and i've been poor and i choose rich every time.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{at least as a rich man, when i have to face my problems, i show up in the back of a limo wearing a $2000 suit and $40,000 gold watch!}
<A>__{jordan takes off his gold watch, flings it to the crowd. brokers go nuts, fighting over it like a home run ball.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{and if anyone here thinks i'm crazy, get the fuck out and get a job at mcdonald's, because that's where you fucking belong! but before you depart this room full of winners, i want you to take a good look at the person next to you, because one day in the not so distant future, you'll be sitting at a red light in your beat up old pinto, and that person's gonna pull up in a brand new porsche, with their gorgeous young wife at their side. and who will you be next to? some ugly beast with three days of razor stubble in a sleeveless moo moo, crammed in next to you with a carload of groceries from the fucking price club!}
<A>__{he scans the brokers; they're on the edge of their seats.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{so you listen to me and listen carefully. are you behind on your credit card bills? good. pick up the phone and start dialing. is your landlord threatening to evict you? good. pick up the phone and start dialing. does your girlfriend think you're a fucking loser? pick up the phone and start fucking dialing! i want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich! i want you to go out and spend money! leverage yourself, back yourself into a corner, let the consequences of failure become so fucking unthinkable that you'll have no choice but to do whatever it takes to win!}
<A>__{the brokers go absolutely apeshit.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{you have an obligation here, people! to your clients! to this firm! an obligation to yourself, godammit! you ram steve madden stock down your clients' throats and make them choke on it till they buy 20,000 shares! be aggressive! be ferocious! be telephone fucking terrorists!!}
<A>__{before jordan is even finished, the brokers go berserk, some already dialing their phones.}
<D>__{jordan (v.o.) (cont'd) at 1 p.m. we opened the stock for sale at $4.50 a share. by 1:03 it was over eighteen dollars.}
