<T>__{dawning realization:}
<C>__{mr. bishop}
<D>__{it's not enough.}
<L>__{interior stone cave. night}
<A>__{flashlight and lantern flames flicker over the jagged walls. skotak is curled in a blanket on a high rock. gadge is tucked into a sleeping bag under a ledge. the troop nestle on rocks and ledges in bedrolls and sleeping bags all around the deep cavern. sam lies on his back on one of the bedrolls smoking his pipe while suzy sits indian style next to him. she reads aloud from a book called annabelle's midnight. there is an illustration on the cover of a blonde girl climbing out a window onto a trellis with fireflies circling around her.}

<D>__{" but i'm not going," said barnaby jack. "i'm running away tonight for good, and this time i won't get caught." annabelle whispered: "i'm coming with you." her yellow hair, now brown at the roots, caught up in the wind and danced. barnaby jack took annabelle's hand and pressed something into it the size of a jellybean. "hide this in your socks, and be ready at midnight."}
<A>__{suzy looks to sam to see if he is still awake. sam looks to the rest of the troop to see if they are still awake. they all nod and signal for suzy to continue. suzy turns the page and reads on:}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{he leapt out the window and landed in the fresh fallen snow.}
