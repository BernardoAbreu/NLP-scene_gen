<L>__{exterior elmo's day}
<A>__{a truck stop set back as little as the law allows from the buzz of interstate 70.}
<C>__{jenny }
<D>__{i'm looking for a guy about this tall, with brown hair and really gray eyes...}
<A>__{we find jenny at the set of fuel pumps nearest the highway dogging an attendant while he services an 18 wheeler}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{he had on tan cords, a plaid shirt and a baseball cap... probably hitchhiking.}
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{i don't pay much attention to those guys.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(taking out her wallet)}
<D>__{in the last hour or so...}
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{nope.}
<A>__{jenny folds back the plastic windows to the picture of her husband.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{this is him.}
<C>__{attendant}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{we follow jenny as she wends her way through the trucks questioning other attendants. the rumble of traffic drowns out their conversation, but the answer is always the same. finally, we follow the picture as jenny hands it up to an attendant cleaning the windshield on a peterbilt cab.}
<C>__{second attendant}
<P>__{(looking at picture)}
<D>__{i don't know... i'm not sure. i might have seen him up the road a piece on my way in. he's long gone by now.}
<A>__{he hands the snapshot back to jenny. she nods a 'thank you' and looks wistfully around the yard. there is nothing she can do. fitting the picture back into her wallet, she walks away. after a few steps she turns back.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you know if anybody here's going to wisconsin?}
<C>__{second attendant}
<D>__{ask inside.}
