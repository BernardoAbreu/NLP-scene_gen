<A>__{the party has moves into the living room floor, around the coffee table. it's a quieter moment.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{there is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{no shit, holmes. you're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{you humans are very curious to us. you invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before. you lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... you give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality. you aspire to very high ideals here.}
<A>__{sykes is watching jetson, mesmerized. the guy's never said this much at one time before. if he wasn't drunk, jetson would never let himself open up to a human like this.}
<C>__{jetson}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are. so it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{don't count on me, george. i never had any ideals.}
<A>__{jetson smiles a little. he knows that's bullshit.}
<C>__{jetson}

<A>__{sykes studies him a long time through heavy lidded eyes. finally }
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{yeah, well... except i did hear you eat your dead.}
<A>__{jetson looks at him a long beat, then }
<C>__{jetson}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{only on fridays.}
<A>__{sykes stares at him for about five seconds and then explodes with laughter.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{you son of a bitch. you're okay.}
<A>__{jetson stands unsteadily, and announces:}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{i'm going home.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{yeah, go home. get some sleep. you do sleep, don't you?}
<A>__{jetson, going out the front door, just waves over his shoulder without turning around. he's gone.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{what a wildman...}
<A>__{sykes, stands there wobbling, then he collapses backward onto the sofa, unconscious. and we match dissolve to: }
