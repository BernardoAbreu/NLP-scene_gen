<A>__{a quiet, deserted industrial street. it is over an hour before dawn and the street is still cloaked in the heavy stillness of night. in the weak light filtering out of their battered van, bert and cybil the craft service managers, finish setting out breakfast supplies on a 6' table. they work in almost complete silence, both nearly paralyzed with sleep. a cheap walkie talkie, lying beside a paper plate of soggy oreos, sputters and buzzes occasionally. other items on the table include a mangled banana, seven grapes, and a box of chocolate covered donuts.}

<C>__{cybil}
<D>__{i don't know. you're the one who said it was bad.}
<A>__{at that moment a large truck grinds around the corner and shudders to a stop in front of the building. bert replaces the carton of milk neatly beside the orange juice.}
