<A>__{cyclops has a clear shot now. his eyes start to glow brightly. suddenly, a familiar movement on the pedestal behind him. toad has been camouflaged the entire time. he comes down and flicks his lizard like tongue, snatching the visor from cyclopsi face. deep red light far greater than anything we have ever seen before comes blasting out of cyclopsi eyes without any sort of control, as if a fire hydrant had been ripped from the ground. his head comes back and the light blows the whole of the glass ceiling to smithereens, bringing it down on panicking shoppers who scatter. toad leaps to the second level and then again out of sight.}
