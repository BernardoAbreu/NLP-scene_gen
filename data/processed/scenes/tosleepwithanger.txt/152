<A>__{harry comes in and hattie and suzie stop talking. harry is aware that he was the subject. the sound of the boy next door playing his horn is heard.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{good afternoon, ladies.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{good afternoon to you.}
<A>__{harry waits for hattie to respond but it is obvious that hattie isn't about to speak to him.}
<C>__{hattie}
<D>__{i'm going to check on gideon.}

<C>__{suzie}

<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{hattie is a different person now.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i don't make no bones about where i'm going to spend eternity. i have always been wild and you know that. if you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?}

<D>__{you invited me.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{only if you are a good man, a friend. are you a friend?}
<A>__{harry takes his time in looking for an answer.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{like that boy next door playing that his horn. if he was a friend, he would stop irritating people, but if he stops practicing, he wouldn't be perfect in what he does someday.}
