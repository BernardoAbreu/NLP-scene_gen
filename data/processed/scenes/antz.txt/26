<L>__{exterior ant mound day}
<A>__{hold on: the garbage chute exit. nothing happens for a moment. then from a distance, we hear the faint sound of screaming, dopplering closer and then z and bala come flying out of the exit, right into the mud, cutting off the scream abruptly. bala sits up, coated in mud. z is nowhere to be seen. because she's on top of him.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{this is thoroughly unacceptable!}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{you're telling me...}
<A>__{she gets up and runs back towards the colony entrance, where soldiers are already issuing to get her...}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{i'm coming! i'm coming!}
<A>__{but...just as bala'a about to be rescued...what looks like a gigantic laser beam sweeps along the rim of the colony, sizzling the ground as it moves along...and ignites the lead soldier into flames! bala looks stunned. z watches in horror as another soldier ant is fried, and we look up to see a gigantic magnifying glass casting the beam...we can just about make out the huge, grotesque figure (a seven year old kid) holding it. bala, who has no idea what's really going on, turns from the colony and runs the other way.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{i'm going! i'm going'}
<A>__{...unfortunately, this draws the fire of the laser, which follows after her in what looks like a strafing run, sizzling in her footsteps. z, who's running towards the princess, suddenly realizes that he's running towards certain doom...and joins bala in legging it away from the colony; under a brown leaf, which burstsinto flames...between the redwood like stalks of some flowers...and finally into the relative safety of some grass...where they throw themselves on the ground, exhausted.}
