<L>__{interior norland park morning room day}
<A>__{mrs dashwood is ruminating sadly. marianne rushes in holding a letter.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{mamma, look. this has just arrived.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<P>__{(reading from the letter)}
<D>__{'i should be pleased to offer you a home at barton cottage as soon as ever you have need of it' why, it is from my cousin, sir john middleton!}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{even elinor must approve the rent.}
<A>__{mrs dashwood looks at the letter again and thinks.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{has elinor not yet seen this?}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{no i will fetch her.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{wait. no. let us delay.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{i think i believe that edward and elinor have formed an attachment.}
<A>__{marianne nods, a little reluctantly.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{it would be cruel to take her away so soon and devonshire is so far.}
<A>__{mrs dashwood makes her decision. she takes the letter and hides it in the pocket of her gown. marianne looks on frowningly.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{why so grave? do you disapprove her choice?}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{by no means. edward is very amiable.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{amiable but?}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{but there is something wanting. he is too sedate his reading last night.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{elinor has not your feelings, his reserve suits her.}
<A>__{marianne thinks for a little.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{can he love her? can the ardour of the soul really be satisfied with such polite, concealed affections? to love is to burn to be on fire, all made of passion, of adoration, of sacrifice! like juliet, or guinevere or heloise.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{they made rather pathetic ends, dear.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{pathetic! to die for love? how can you say so? what could be more glorious?}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{i think that may be taking your romantic sensibilities a little far.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{the more i know of the world, the more i am convinced that i shall never see a man whom i can truly love.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{you require so much!}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{i do not! i require only what any young woman of taste should a man who sings well, dances admirably, rides bravely, reads with passion and whose tastes agree in every point with my own.}
