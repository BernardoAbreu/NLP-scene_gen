<C>__{miller}
<D>__{how about that jeep?}
<C>__{supply sergeant}
<D>__{that's general gavin's. his lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, i will get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, i will get court marshaled. if you were to take it, they'd shoot me.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{cap'n, does that mean we got to walk all the way up to ramelle?}
<C>__{supply sergeant}
<D>__{what's at ramelle beside a lot of germans.}

<D>__{senator's son?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{no, three brothers of his were killed in action. command wants him out of there.}
<A>__{the supply sergeant grunts as if punched in the belly.}
<C>__{supply sergeant}
<D>__{damn...i got a couple brothers...}
