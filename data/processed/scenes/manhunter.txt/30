<C>__{dr. chilton}
<D>__{when you saw dr. lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? and did that help you identify him?}
<B>__{dr. chilton}
<A>__{looks at graham. dr. chilton has seen a lot of hostility. right now he's seeing some more.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(stands)}
<D>__{i want to see lecktor now.}
<C>__{dr. chilton}
<D>__{uh... sure...}
<L>__{interior maximum security section door day}
<A>__{we hear three locks opening. the door opens. graham enters. an attendant behind graham closes the door and we hear the bolts lock again. as graham is walking towards us, we widen and track in. it makes the b.g. disorienting as we get closer to graham's face. the camera drops as graham sits in a single chair. we haven't yet seen what graham looks at. now: graham's pov: barred cell a 6x10 cage. in the center of the bars separating graham from the occupant is a three foot square perspex sheet. the occupant can't get at someone sitting in front of him. in the perspex square is a letter passing drawer. in the cell laying on his bunk is dr. hannibal lecktor. he appears to be asleep. his back is to graham. he has not stirred. then:}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{that's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i keep getting it for christmas.}
<A>__{close: lecktor's head turns to us. his small eyes drill into graham's brain. lecktor's attitude is professionally psychiatric, as if graham is the patient.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{did you get my card?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i got it. thank you.}
<A>__{graham' s struggle will be to keep locked down inside himself all his emotional reactions.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{and how is officer stuart? the one who was the first to see my basement.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{stuart is fine.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{emotional problems, i hear. he was a very promising young officer. do you ever have any problems, will?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{of course, you don't.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i'm glad you came. my callers are all professional. clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. second raters, the lot.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{dr. bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of clinical psychiatry.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{very interesting, even to a layman.}
<A>__{lecktor rolls around and examines the term "layman" in his head. then:}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{a layman.., layman. interesting term. so many experts on government grants. and you say you're a 'layman?' but it was you who caught me, wasn't it, will? do you know how you did it'}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{you've read the transcript. it's all there.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{no it's not. do you know how you did it will?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{it's in the transcript. what does it matter now?}
<C>__{lecktor}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{it doesn't matter to me, will.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i want you to help me, dr. lecktor.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{yes, i thought so.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{it's about atlanta and birmingham.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{yes .}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{you read about it, i'm sure.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{in the papers. i don't rear out the articles.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i wouldn't want them to think i was dwelling on anything morbid. you want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i thought you would have some ideas.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{why should i tell you?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{there are things you don't have. research materials... i could speak to the chief of staff...?}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{chilton? gruesome, isn't he? he fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.}
<P>__{(laugh;)}
<D>__{he actually tries to give me a thematic and apperception test. hah. sat there waiting for mf 13 to come up. it's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground. i was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. i laughed in his face.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{never mind, it's boring.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{you'll get to see the file on this case. and there's another reason.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{pray tell.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person i'm looking for.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{no. i knew that i'm nor smarter than you are.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{then how did you catch me, will?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{you had disadvantages.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{what disadvantage?.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{you're insane.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{you're very tan, will.}
<A>__{graham does not answer, if anything happens, there is a tightening of the musculature repressing his reactions to lecktor.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{your hands are rough. they don't look like a cop s hands anymore. that shaving lotion is something a child would select. it has a ship on the bottle, doesn't it?}
<A>__{another silence. lecktor's eyes look as if they're drilling into graham's head, trying to find out things. trying to find a way to hurt graham. he's very threatening. then relaxes:}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i don't think i will persuade you. you'll do it or you won't. dr. bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...}
<C>__{lecktor}
<P>__{(interrupts)}
<D>__{do you have the file with you}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{pictures?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{let me have them,, and i might consider it.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{do you dream much, will?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{good bye, dr. lecktor.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{you haven't threatened to take away my books yet.}
<A>__{graham gets up and starts to walk away.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{let me have the file. then i will tell you what i think.}
<A>__{graham stops at the door before he knocks for the attendant. then he folds the abridged file tightly into the sliding tray. lecktor pulls it through.}
<B>__{graham}
<A>__{sits in the chair. he wants a cigarette. he doesn't take one. he waits. and he watches. what he sees: graham's pov: extreme close pan through cell op}
<B>__{dr. lecktor}
<A>__{toothbrush, mirror, sink, sryrofoam cups, soft paper jour nals, t shirts, neatly stacked hospital pads, sneakers with no shoelaces, the wall, seatless toilet bowl, etc, etc all the objects are brilliantly lit with sharp bluish light. their edges are sharper and more defined than normal. the shadows of the bars make hard edged stripes. it is a high resolution, highly brilliant sec of images. it feels like a hyper perception of reality, a super realism perceived by the mind of graham. it is interrupted when:}
<C>__{lecktor }
<D>__{there is a very shy boy, will.}
<B>__{graham}
<A>__{snaps back to the present, looks at lecktor.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{what were the yards like?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{because, my dear will, if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it. have you seen blood in moonlight, will? it appears quite black. if one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{that's interesting.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{it's not 'interesting'. you thought of it before.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{yes. i'd considered it.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{you came here to look at me, will. to get the old scent again, didn't you?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i want your opinion.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{i don't have one right now.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{when you do have one i'd like to hear it.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{may i keep the file?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i haven't decided yet.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{i will study it, will. when you get more files, i'd like to see them, too. you can call me. when i have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. would you like to give me your home number?}
<A>__{threat.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{do you know how you caught me, will?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{goodbye, dr. lecktor. you can leave messages for me at the number on the file.}
<A>__{graham bangs on the door. locks are starting to be unlocked. graham can't wait to get out of here. he wants the locks to get unlocked faster!}
<C>__{lecktor}
<D>__{do you know how you caught me?}
<A>__{the door is now open. graham fights down the impulse to run through. as graham controlled steps out, what he hears is :}
<C>__{lecktor }
<D>__{the reason you caught me, will, is: we're just alike. you want the scent? smell yourself.}
<A>__{the door slams shut on lecktor.}
