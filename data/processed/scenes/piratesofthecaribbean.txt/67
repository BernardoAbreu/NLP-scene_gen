<L>__{exterior the faithful bride rear day}
<A>__{a drunken man lays in the mud, having a friendly conversation with two pigs. he wears an old tattered navy jacket. a sudden spray of water splashes across his face, revealing: this is old joshamee gibbs (the man who told pirate stories to elizabeth when she was a child). he sputters and roars:}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{curse you for breathing, you slack jawed idiot}
<P>__{(recognizes jack)}
<D>__{mother's love, jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping. it's bad luck!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, fortunately, i know how to counter it. the man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{aye, that'll about do it.}
<A>__{jack helps gibbs to his feet and then gibbs is hit with a second wave of water. will stands there with the bucket.}
<C>__{gibbs }
<D>__{blast it, i'm already awake!}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i know. that was for the smell.}
