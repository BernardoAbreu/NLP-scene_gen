<A>__{rocky stands at the base of an overwhelmingly steep flight of stairs. he stares up at the stairs that nearly disappear into the morning gray. taking a deep breath, he starts up. from the start, he looks out of shape and halfway up his legs give way. standing, he brushes off and descends the stairs.}
<L>__{exterior city hall dawn}
