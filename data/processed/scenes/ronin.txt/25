<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior a side street night}
<A>__{the fiat pulls up to the curb and vincent and sam get out. vincent leads sam around a corner and they come to an exquisite park, a small, perfectly manicured place a kind of mini luxembourg gardens in the middle of nowhere. when sam sees the park, he draws an involuntary breath.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{lovely, isn't it?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{they'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in new york, and it would still get fucked up.}
<A>__{the two men enter the park, which is, indeed, open to the public. inside, sitting on a bench in the back, almost invisible from the street, we see francois, a stubble faced tough with a stained shirt and bad teeth. vincent and sam draw near. this next conversation between francois and vincent is in french with english subtitles.}
<C>__{francois}
<D>__{that's good right where you are, vincent.}
<A>__{vincent signals for sam to stop. both vincent and sam are still several feet away from francois.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{do you have it?}
<C>__{francois}
<D>__{not so fast.}
<P>__{(nods slightly to sam)}
<D>__{who's that?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{he's company.}
<C>__{francois}
<P>__{(as if he recognizes sam)}
<D>__{bad company...}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{francois}
<D>__{he's a cop, vincent, he's french and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!}
<A>__{sam hasn't said a word he doesn't seem to understand what's been said, but he has noted the urgency with which francois spoke. now we hold for a beat. neither vincent nor francois pulls out a piece to shoot sam. instead they wait to see if sam will respond in any way to what francois said. the conversation now switches to english, which (it turns out) francois speaks fairly well.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(to vincent)}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i just wanted to see something.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(that edge creeping into his voice)}
<D>__{see what?}
<A>__{vincent isn't going to answer, but the overbearing francois chimes in.}
<C>__{francois}
<D>__{he wanted to see how you reacted when i said that you were a cop.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(he can't believe this)}
<D>__{you told him i was a cop?}
<C>__{francois}
<D>__{he asked me to say it.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(looking at vincent, truly pissed)}
<D>__{he asked you to?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i needed to know.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you need to know a lot of shit, vincent.}
<C>__{francois}
<P>__{(to vincent, in subtitled french)}
<D>__{are you ready?}
<A>__{francois's french words give sam pause he's wondering what's being said, as vincent moves towards francois, leaving sam several steps away. the conversation is again in}
<B>__{subtitled french.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(taking out an envelope)}
<D>__{here's yours.}
<C>__{francois}
<D>__{there's been a slight problem.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(immediately tensing)}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{francois gives the slightest of nods, indicating that vincent should look towards a place perhaps thirty yards away a copse of trees, where we see a sniper pointed a telescopic rifle at vincent.}
<C>__{francois}
<P>__{(still in subtitled french)}
<D>__{if you say a word in english, vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if i give it to you, and that's a price i'm not willing to pay.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(in french)}
<D>__{i take it you still want the money...}
<C>__{francois}
<P>__{(in english, with a grin)}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{sam's pov: looking at vincent and francois. the men are talking, and from here we can't really hear them speak. all sam can see is an earnest vincent listening to francois talk, almost as if francois is giving vincent instructions. now vincent reaches into his pocket, reaching for the envelope of cash he's carrying. as he hands the money to francois, vincent uses his free hand to pull out his gun while sam already has his gun out somehow he figured out what was going on and now francois looks on in stunned disbelief as sam fires a single shot, hitting francois in the shoulder, driving him away from vincent, who now squeezes off several rapid fire shots at the sniper, while francois, bleeding but still very much alive, now has his piece free just as the sniper, his gun firing wildly into the air, falls to the ground, shot dead by vincent, and now francois is drawing a bead on vincent when sam hits francois with a fusillade of bullets in the chest and now a single spent bulled casing flies through the air in slow motion and lands on the ground, spinning around until it comes to a halt and a heavy silence falls, as the last echo of the last gunshot finally dies. vincent and sam look at one another, see that they're still alive, and then look back at the two men they've shot. francois isn't quite dead. blood bubbles from his lips as vincent leans over him. again, they speak in}
<B>__{subtitled french}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{where's my information?}
<C>__{francois}
<P>__{(with a grim smile, pointing to his head)}
<D>__{in here...}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{then you better find it in your heart to tell me, francois, because while your death is inevitable, it still isn't decided how painful it's going to be.}
<A>__{a long angle vincent whispers in francois's ear, whose grin blanches as he realizes vincent means to hurt him. francois whispers something back and then bang. vincent shoots francois in the head, killing him instantly. then vincent bends down and retrieves the envelope of money which francois had tucked inside his shirt. as vincent does this, sam comes up from behind.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{now would be a good time to get the fuck out of here.}
