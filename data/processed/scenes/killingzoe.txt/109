<L>__{interior bank caliber vault day}
<A>__{zed is sweating as he works away at the back of the door. he glances over what he's done and makes a calculation on a calculator. then, there is a groaning sound. zed, terrified, spins around. another groaning sound. the vault security guard isn't dead. his body is charred and he's not moving but he's very much alive.}
<D>__{vault guard #1 [i'm going to die...]}
<A>__{zed can't believe what he's seeing. he moves over to the body, leaving his work behind.}
<D>__{vault guard #1 [i'm going to die...please hold my...hand. i don't...want to die...alone.]}
<A>__{zed hovers over the body, afraid to touch it. he gives it a nudge with his foot. the body groans and then exhales the longest exhale ever. zed kneels down next to the body.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{are you still there?}
<A>__{nothing. zed puts his hand to the neck of the vault guard #1 and checks for a pulse. nothing. zed sits there for a moment looking at the corpse, then, like he wants to get out of there as soon as possible, he scrambles to the door and starts adjusting several switches. he has wired a battery to two leads. he takes out a wire cutter and snips a wire. there is a sudden barrage of whirring and clicking sounds as the vault unlocks. zed calls to oliver from the passage.}
