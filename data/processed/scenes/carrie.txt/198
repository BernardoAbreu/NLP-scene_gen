<A>__{cutting between the final arrangements for the prom itself and carrie's preparations as the night approaches. the emphasis is on these two paralleling elements, although this montage scored throughout with happier and happier music will also feature some of our lesser characters. among other things, we will see:}
<D>__{a) the gym as last minute arrangements are made more crepe paper hung, party favors put on tables, etc.; b) carrie in a town store as she shops for makeup; c) norma watson under a hair dryer, her mouth going a mile a minute as a manicurist does her nails and looks utterly exhausted; d) tommy picking out carrie's corsage at the florist; e) carrie at the sewing machine, finishing her dress (which we still don't see), a happy look on her face; f) the gym as a bank of lights suddenly illuminate the mural on the stage wall; g) sue having dinner with her parents h) the twins in front of their dressing tables; both of them putting on enormous fake eyelashes simultaneously; i) ernest the class president making sure the microphone on the stage works; j) the band among them, the beak, setting up; k) sandra stenchfeld, practicing her fabulous twirling baton act; l) a door which opens to reveal the twins in their high heels, both of them several inches taller than their depressed looking dates; m) george and frieda he in his tuxedo, she in her prom dress; a flash as freida's parents take a polaroid of this night to remember; n) the gym with the adult chaperones teachers, administrators standing around, looking for something to do.}
