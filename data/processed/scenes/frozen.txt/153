<A>__{the morning sun hits parker's pale face. is she dead? parker opens her eyes. she must have drifted off for the night. she looks to the tree line around her. the sun is coming up. she tries to move her body to look back in lynch's direction and the chair argues back at her with another loud groan and cable noise.}

<D>__{lynch.}
<A>__{there is no sign of anyone or anything in the direction down the hill behind her. slowly a look of great determination comes over her face. she raises the safety bar. there is no more time to think. she is going to die one way or another. slowly, parker turns her body around towards the seat of the chair. holding on to the metal beams that make up the chair, she beings to lower herself, inch by inch, off of the side. creeeee eek! the lone metal bolt protests the movement and makes metallic threats to snap. parker keeps lowering herself until her entire lower body is dangling below the chair. rrrrruuuuuurrr! a gust of wind pushes against the chair, straining the arm. parker concentrates and slowly tries to hold up her weight as she inches her body even lower. smoothly, slowly, almost there snap! the bolt gives way! the chair lurches down at an even greater angle, sending parker off of the side!}

<D>__{ahhhh!}
<A>__{whirrr! wap! no longer attached with the safety bolts, the chair falls several feet and then stops. it is now hanging only by the one weak thread of cabling that was used to initially wire it to the main line. parker's hands catch at the base of the chair, and she is dangling fully beneath it. while it is still a long drop...her feet are now a good 10 feet closer to the ground, if not more. creeeeek! the metal wire will not hold for more than a few seconds. the chair is going to fall! parker closes her eyes. all sound cuts out except for her quick breathing and her heartbeat. the camera shows us how much the last flimsy wire does not like this movement as it stretches and the chair sways in the wind. slowly she looks down and prepares herself to fall.}
<B>__{e}
<A>__{the camera inches closer in to her face from below. her heartbeat and breathing are all we hear until finally... she let's go. as her body falls from the chair, the flimsy wire finally gives way and the rickety metal seat plummets straight down to the ground after her.}
