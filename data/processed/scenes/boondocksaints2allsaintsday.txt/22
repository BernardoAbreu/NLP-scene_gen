<A>__{eunice stands, looking down the aisle at the altar. behind her, the detectives are curios as eunice slides on pink latex gloves. she puts in ear plugs and all ambient sound ceases. she starts slowly down the aisle... total silence as...eunice inspects the smashed door of a confessional booth. she looks over the body closely then turns from the altar and walks to the detectives. she pulls her earplugs and all sound returns.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{it wasn't them...but i'm sure you boys already knew that.}
<A>__{the detectives nod.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{the two "v's." the victim and venue don't add up.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{let's go with the venue first. our perpetrators are devout. they would never commit such an act on sacred ground. and as for the victim?}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{all their vics were criminals. clearly not the case here. so, it wasn't them which means this is a local matter and it falls under our jurisdiction. no need for federal involvement so with all due respect...we'll see you later, special agent bloom.}
<A>__{eunice stands right in front of dolly.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{man, i hate it when people say that. "with all due respect." because it is inevitably followed by a disrespectful remark. i will give you an example. with all due respect, detective, this matter falls under whatever jurisdiction i fuckin' say it does.}
<A>__{dolly fumes. duffy and greenly share an "oh shit" look.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{uh, so...let's just...what can you tell us about the shooters?}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{shoo ter. singular. and i can tell you that he is left handed and how shall i put this delicately...? he's a short bastard.}
<C>__{dolly}
<P>__{(facetious)}
<D>__{one guy, lefty, short. got it.}
<A>__{eunice furrows her brow.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{i will show you what i'm talking about.}
