<D>__{gordon couldn't invest any of his money so he put most of it into the children's names with directions on how it was to be invested.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he definitely knew what he was doing...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{and how could winnie get it now?}
<A>__{hadley stops walking and thinks about it.}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{well, she'd have to sign a reversion of trust document. that way the funds would revert back to their pre trust posture and regulations.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{so all she has to do is sign a piece of paper?}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{basically.}
<A>__{as that registers...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{how much is in there?}
<C>__{hadley}

<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{i don't know. assuming immediate liquidity... over three hundred million.}
<A>__{and with that, jacob sets to go. but...}
<C>__{hadley }
<D>__{of course... gordon would have to sign the document as well.}
