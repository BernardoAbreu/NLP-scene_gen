<L>__{interior testing control booth continuous [former sc. 72]}
<A>__{and they're stunned up here, too test administrator #2 turns to someone off camera:}
<D>__{test administrator #2 how the hell'd that kid beat your test?}
<A>__{reveal who he was talking to: spock is here. and not happy.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{... i do not know.}
<L>__{interior academy council chambers day}
<A>__{tight on a stern starfleet academy president:}
<C>__{academy president}
<D>__{james t. kirk. step forward.}
<A>__{it's a huge starfleet chamber. golden gate bridge visible through huge windows. 500 cadets, a nervous kirk among them. he stands, moves to one of two podiums.}
<C>__{academy president }
<D>__{an incident has occurred today that concerns the entire student body. academic immorality by one is an assault on us all. it will. not. stand. cadet kirk, evidence has been submitted to this council suggesting you violated the ethical code of conduct pursuant to regulation 17.43 of the starfleet code. is there anything you care to say before we begin?}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(uncomfortable beat)}
<D>__{yessir. i believe i have the right to face my accuser directly.}
<A>__{president nods toward the assembly. spock rises. he and kirk meet eyes for the first time. it's clock stopping.}
<C>__{academy president}
<D>__{step forward please. this is commander spock, one of our most distinguished graduates. he's programmed the kobayashi maru test for the last four years.}
<A>__{spock steps up to the other podium. president nods.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{cadet kirk. it is obvious you somehow managed to install and activate a sub routine in the programming code, thereby changing the conditions of the test.}
<A>__{we happen to find gaila, in the crowd, fucking pissed.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{your point being?}
<C>__{academy president}
<D>__{in academic vernacular, you cheated.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{respectfully. define "cheating".}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{to deceive by trickery.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{now let me ask you something i think we all know the answer to: the test is rigged, isn't it? you programmed it to be unwinnable.}
<C>__{academy president}
<D>__{mr. kirk, i don't see how the intent of the exam is relevant to these proceedings.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{because if i'm right, sir, then the test itself is a cheat.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{your argument precludes the possibility of a no win scenario }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i don't believe in no win scenarios }
<A>__{find pike amongst the officers in attendance. his eyes locked on kirk. this is his boy. his recruit. and he's invested.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{then not only have you violated the rules, you've failed to understand the principle lesson.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{please, enlighten me.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{you, of all people should know, cadet kirk a captain cannot cheat death.}
<A>__{on kirk. the first punch by spock that landed. the cockiness slips away as he senses where this is going }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{"i of all people?"}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{your father, lieutenant george kirk, had assumed command of his vessel before killed in action, did he not?}
<A>__{shit. the daddy card. kirk, a mix of anger and embarrassment }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{how long did it take you to look that up?}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{how long did it take you to program the virus that allowed you to cheat?}
<A>__{the president smirks; considers ending this now but doesn't, it's just too damn entertaining...}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{maybe you just don't like that i beat your test.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{i am vulcan. "like" is not a verb in our vernacular. i've simply made the logical deduction that you're a liar.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{what an idiot i am for taking that personally }
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{agreed. furthermore, you have failed to divine the purpose of the test.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{enlighten me again.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{the purpose is to experience fear. fear in the face of certain death. to accept that fear and maintain command of one's self and one's crew. this is a quality expected in every starfleet captain.}
<A>__{kirk absorbs that. then }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{so you're telling me the pointerior of the whole thing. is to be afraid?}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{fear is necessary, yes.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{have you taken the test, commander spork?}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{spock. as a vulcan, i require no additional training to control my narcissism when making command decisions.}
<A>__{no he din't! kirk's hit guys for a lot less the crowd all but "oooooohs." but kirk ain't fucking done yet.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you keep reminding me that you're vulcan. and i'm sure you're really proud of that, who wouldn't be but isn't it true you people don't experience fear at all?}
<A>__{on spock. he raises that eyebrow. and kirk sees... no matter how subtly... that he has fucking made contact. smelling blood }
<C>__{kirk }
<D>__{and if that's the case what's that say about your ability to make command decisions?}
<A>__{well. looks like kirk just hit him in his fucking weak spot. and before this lovefest can continue a redshirt bursts into the hall kirk turns to look they all do now we're speeding in behind the redshirt, who runs to the president, hands him a datapad. president reads it. everyone watches, on edge finally, quietly:}
<C>__{academy president}
<P>__{(to all)}
<D>__{we've received a distress call from vulcan.}
<P>__{(spock reacts concerned)}
<D>__{cadet kirk you are on academic probation pending the result of your hearing. cadets, report to shuttle hangar one immediately this hearing is at recess until further notice dismissed.}
<A>__{everyone's on their feet, moving quickly, kirk suddenly irrelevant. pike passes by him, all fucking business, but before he goes }
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{cheating isn't winning.}
<A>__{and as that settles on kirk, mccoy now joins him. the two exiting with the rest of the cadets as kirk eyes spock }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{who was that pointy eared bastard?}
<C>__{mccoy}
<D>__{i don't know, but i like him.}
