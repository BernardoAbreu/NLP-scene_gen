<D>__{i'm hotchkiss...i came for the...grecian candlesticks...}
<A>__{the fat man studies him warily for a long moment; then he disappears through the curtain. in a brief moment, he emerges again, carrying a small, "makeup sized" case, as well as two large candelabra. the pawnbroker puts the case on the counter. quail looks at the case with curiosity.}
