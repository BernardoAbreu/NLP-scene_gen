<L>__{interior sheeni's dorm room night}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{don't be silly, darling. not with others in the room.}
<P>__{(leaning in to whisper)}
<D>__{we must wait until everyone falls asleep.}
<A>__{nick tries to appear unconcerned. she gives him a kiss and climbs into her narrow bed. as nick and vijay prepare their sleeping bags on the floor, they watch taggarty climb up to her bunk in the sky.}
<C>__{taggerty}
<D>__{goodnight boys. do you need the light on to take off your clothes?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(flipping off the light)}
<D>__{we can find our zippers in the dark.}
<A>__{a beat of blackness. then a light tap at the door. there is the sound of sheeni getting out of bed. she cracks the door, letting in just enough light from the hall that a male shadow gets cast across the two boys on the floor. nick squints and tries to hear what sheeni and the male shadow are whispering to each other. after a beat, sheeni closes the door and the room plunges into blackness once again. nick listens as sheeni climbs back into bed as if nothing happened.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{sheeni?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{yes, nick?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{was that the matron?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{then who was it?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{it was trent.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{did you say it was trent?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{yes. he came to discuss our friendship. i told him now was not the time.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{so where is trent now?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{i assume he went back to the boys' dorm. now really, nickie, you are keeping everyone awake with your inquiries.}
<A>__{though silence follows, we take a moment to allow nick's mind to race in the dark. he stands and looks at the mirror above the dresser. francois can be made out sitting by the window in the moonlight, stroking the thompson.}
<C>__{francois}
<D>__{now is our chance.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{chance for what?}
<C>__{francois}
<D>__{to confront our nemesis. we must go to the boys' dorm and kill trent where he sleeps.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i suppose we should at least get a look at him. to see what we're dealing with.}
<C>__{francois}
<D>__{very well.}
<P>__{(stubbing out his cigarette)}
<D>__{you see what we are dealing with... and zen i wll deal wiz it.}
<A>__{and with that he cocks the thompson for dramatic flare.}
