<A>__{on complete darkness. a small door swings open. a circle of light reveals that we i re looking down the length of a tube. at the far end of the tube, we see a gloved hand dangling a rat. the hand shoves the frightened rat into the tube and closes the door behind it. the rat s stark white fur bristles and it begins to pad down the tube s length. after several feet, the tube opens up into a dimly lit cubicle. the rat hesitates and stops. the sounds of gentle breathing whispers in the rat s ears. the rat turns round to head back down the tube, but a door swings shut, trapping it in the cubicle. the rat cowers as the breathing turns to snorting. the rat s head jerks around, looking for signs of danger, but the cubicle is empty. the rat sees a water dish on the far side of the cubicle a place to hide and dashes toward it. but an invisible force descends. the rat squeals in agony as something smashes down on its body, crushing it. a loud bellow rings out, and the rat flies into the air, halting a few feet off the ground. its body writhes, struggling against the unholy force. then a sick crunch of tiny bones snapping. all life quickly drains from the levitating body. dead eyes... the creature s corpse floats in mid air. then the white fur of the rat explodes in a shower of blood. huge blood smeared incisors appear, as do the red slicked ape like lips. the gaping bloody mouth bites again into the rat.}
