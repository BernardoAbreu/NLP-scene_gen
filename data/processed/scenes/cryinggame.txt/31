<C>__{jody}
<D>__{but if i did... you wouldn't shoot a brother in the back }
<A>__{jody suddenly sprints, and, loosening the ties on his hands, then freeing them, he is off like a hare. fergus screams in fury after him.}

<A>__{fergus aims, then changes his mind and runs.}

<C>__{jody}
<D>__{told you i was fast }
<A>__{fergus is panting, pointing the gun at jody}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{don't do it.}
<A>__{and suddenly a saracen tank whips around the corner, hits jody with the full of its fender. his body flies in the air and bounces forward as another tank tries to grind to a halt and the huge wheels grind over him. fergus, screaming, "no !" he almost moves forward, then sees soldiers spilling from the tank around the body. fergus turns and runs.}
