<L>__{39. rxt. mayapore village after sunset}
<A>__{black clouds clot across the blood red sky as darkness falls. indiana, willie and short round sit tensely on a shabby rug. above their heads, there is a thatched roof, but there are no walls. the dying sunset silhouettes them and the half dozen elders seat ed in the dirt around them. a grey haired man, the village chieftain, gives quiet commands to the women who scuttle in and set wooden plates in front of the three visitors. no plates are places in front of the elders.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(quietly to indy)}
<D>__{i hope this means we're going to get some dinner.}
<A>__{indiana sees the painted shaman, who sits next to the chieftain, watching willie. the women bring in a bowl from which they scoop tiny portions of grey gruel onto three plates. to this the women add a few grains of yellowed rice and a with ered ,molding piece of fruit. willie looks aghast at the unappe tizing combination.}

<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i here, please.}
<A>__{she picks up her plate and gently hands it back to the women. the chieftain finally speaks to them }
<C>__{chieftain}

<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{we'd appreciate that. this was an unexpected detour. we'll have to go to delhi now and find a flight west.}
<C>__{short round}

<D>__{indy is taking me to america.}
<A>__{all eyes are on short round. puzzled by this strange attention, shorty's smile fades nervously.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{i'm a professor. i have to re turn to the university. can you give us a guide to take us to delhi?}
<A>__{the chieftain indicates a young villager sitting near them.}
<C>__{chieftain}
<D>__{sanju will guide you.}

<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{the old shaman speaks now for the first time.}
<C>__{shaman}

<C>__{shaman}
<D>__{you will go to palace there.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{hasn't the pankot palace been de serted since the mutiny of 1857?}
<C>__{shaman}

<D>__{no. now there is new maharajah and palace is powerful again.}
<A>__{the shaman looks around at his unfortunate people.}
<C>__{shaman }
<D>__{it is pankot palace that kills my village.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{i don't understand. what's hap pened here?}
<C>__{shaman}
<D>__{the evil starts in pankot. then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{what evil?}
<C>__{shaman}
<D>__{they came from palace and took sivalinga from out village.}
<A>__{willie looks over at indiana }
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{took what?}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{it's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.}

<A>__{indy's about to object then he looks at the sad chieftain, the elders and peasants who are watching him helplessly. and he sees again the dark steady eyes of the old shaman.}
