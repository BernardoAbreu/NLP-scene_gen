<L>__{exterior road (countryside) day}
<A>__{pamela sits behind the wheel of her convertible listening to pat boone sing "april love" on the car radio. doug drips with sweat as he tightens the lugs on the spare tire. pamela climbs out and inspects his progress.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{you think you'll finish sometime today? i'm getting sun stroke.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{put the top up.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{stop acting like jacey. what makes you think you're so... cool?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{because i know all the answers on 'the $64,000 question,' because i have x ray vision and i can sing better than pat boone. and because i'm really a negro, but don't tell anyone around here, 'cause you know what would happen to me.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{god, i can't even talk to you.}
<A>__{she starts to get back into the car, then turns to him:}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{name one bad thing i've ever done to you.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{go on, name one bad thing.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{what's the point?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{you tell me, because i don't get it! look, i'm not rich, my father is. and i didn't pick my father. and if i had a choice between having tons of money or having another father, i'd be absolutely delighted to be poor! but unfortunately life is not a cafeteria!}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{life is not a cafeteria?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{you know what i mean!}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{shit, i'm supposed to feel sorry for you 'cause you're rich?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{well, am i supposed to feel sorry for you 'cause you're so poor?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{so then just stop it!}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{stop what?!}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{stop treating me like an abbott!}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{well, how am i supposed to treat you?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{like you used to. like just plain pam.}
<A>__{doug exhales as if he's winding up to apologize.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{and you don't have to say you're sorry, and you don't have to look like somebody just ran over your dog. you just make me want to scream sometimes.}
<A>__{doug stares at her as if he's never seen her before.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{what are you looking at?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{you.}
