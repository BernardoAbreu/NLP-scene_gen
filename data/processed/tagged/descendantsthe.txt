<D>__{my missionary ancestors came to the islands and told the hawaiians to put on clothes, work hard, believe in christ, and stop surfing and hula dancing. they made business deals along the way buying an island, or marrying a princess and inheriting her land. now their descendants wear bikinis and running shorts, play beach volleyball and surf, and take up hula dancing. hawai'i has always been a place of contradiction.}

<C>__{matt }
<D>__{my friends on the mainland think just because i live in hawai'i, i live in paradise. like a permanent vacation we're all just out here drinking mai tais, shaking our hips, and catching waves. are they nuts? how can they possibly think our families are less screwed up, our heart attacks and cancers less fatal, our grief less devastating? hell, i haven't been on a surfboard in fifteen years.}

<D>__{matt (v.o.) (cont'd) this is elizabeth king, my wife. twenty three days ago she was launched from a powerboat during a race and hit her head, almost drowned. now she's in a coma that scores 5 on the glasgow scale and 3 on the rancho los amigos scale, scores showing an extremely severe coma. liz is very competitive. whatever she does, she does to the fullest.}

<C>__{ms. hayashi}
<D>__{i can't tell you how my heart goes out to you and your family, but scottie just hasn't been herself. principal cruz agrees with us that it maybe would be better for scottie to remain at home with you during this difficult time.}

<D>__{home. see, i would think that sticking to her normal routine would be the best thing for her you know, keep her occupied. i wouldn't really know how to...}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{i mean, i've kind of got my hands full. and her sister's away at school on the big island. i don't think scottie would really want to hang out with me when she could be with her friends and people like you who specialize in children.}
<C>__{mrs. thull}
<D>__{mr. king, we see this every day children acting out at school when something's wrong at home. and your family is facing a devastating crisis. have you been engaging scottie in really talking about what's going on? encouraging her to express her feelings? that's crucial.}

<D>__{no, you're not. you're overdoing it is what you're doing.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{i saw it in a book. some famous photographer lady took pictures of her mom in the hospital while she was dying, and they're considered art. that's what i'm doing.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{first of all, your mother's very sick, but she's not dying. second, you don't share personal stuff like that with strangers. what's going on with mom is private.}

<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{flash! scottie takes elizabeth's picture again.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i wish you'd stop doing that. and rather than taking her picture all the time, you should talk to her. i'm tired of asking you. you heard dr. johnston people in a coma can hear you you know, well, some of them can. it lets them know they're still loved, might even help them wake up sooner. and it'll help you express whatever feelings and emotions you're supposed to be going through you know, make you feel better.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{i don't know what to say.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{tell her a story.}

<D>__{sure.}

<D>__{if i gave you a lot of money right now, tonight, would you leave?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{why would i leave?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{no, sid, i'm asking you a favor. if i give you money, will you leave?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{oh. i get it. is that what you want? you want me to go?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i guess not.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{look, dude, you're right. if i had daughters, i wouldn't know what to do. exchange them for sons, i guess.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{then i might wind up with something like you.}

<D>__{i'm not so bad. i'm smart.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you're about a hundred miles away from smartville. no offense.}

<D>__{what does she do, your mom?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{she's a receptionist at a pet clinic. but mostly she's been getting the house together after my dad died. my dad died a few months ago.}
<A>__{at first refusing to fall for it, matt sees this is no prank.}
<C>__{sid }
<D>__{november 24th. drunk driver. actually both drivers were drunk. yeah.}

<D>__{that's the guy.}

<D>__{holitzer.}
<C>__{cousin hugh}
<D>__{that's what i'm saying. that's don's brother in law in the cottage. you don't know him? i would have thought you'd know him. he's a realtor over by you. so if we sell to don and that's what we're going to do, right? that's what you want too. nice guy, don. he'll do right by us. then when don develops and re sells and leases and all that }
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yeah, yeah }
<C>__{cousin hugh}
<D>__{he's letting this brother in law in the cottage handle the transactions. a lot of them, anyway. big score for that guy.}

<D>__{who?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{brian speer what else do you know about him?}

<D>__{great.}
<A>__{the music grows more frenetic. matt looks around the room, alienated from everything from the fried food and the tourists, from the umbrellas in the drinks, from his daughters enjoying the music and this cretin called sid. why can't a nuclear bomb blow the whole island up right now?}

<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{well, it's what we came here to do.}

<D>__{got it. sid, come here!}
<A>__{moments later the team are gathered for a little huddle.}
<C>__{alexandra}

<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{i want to come too.}

<C>__{alexandra}

<D>__{yeah, hey, i'm such an idiot. i just figured out i do know your husband. my daughter and i were on our way back to the hotel from dinner, and we thought we'd drop by and say howdy.}

<C>__{julie}
<D>__{so, i guess you guys are deciding really soon. a couple of days, right you and your family meet? i'm sorry. that's probably a conflict of interest or something.}

<D>__{no, it's okay. you're right it'll all be over in a couple of days.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{you guys want a burger?}

<D>__{we just ate, thanks.}

<D>__{look, pal, like she said, i'm not here to wreck your life. i just came to give you a chance to go to the hospital. i don't know how long you're planning on being here, but i'm sure you can think of an excuse to leave.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{you must be good at that.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you can be alone with her to say goodbye or whatever you want. do you hear what i'm saying?}

<D>__{awesome cottage you're renting.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yeah, say, prime hanalei location. i used to come here as a kid before it was a vacation rental. alex, your great uncle warren and aunt lillian built it back in the 20s. haven't been inside in years.}

<D>__{hey, i'm doing you a favor here. i could go out there right now and fuck you up, so get a better attitude. then what? how'd you get the nerve to ask her out?}
<A>__{brian drops his head, rubs his temples.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{i want to know what makes a person cross that line. was it about the deal? is that when you decided she was for you?}

<D>__{no, no. it's not what you think. it just happened.}

<D>__{no, i told you. i wasn't trying to get to you.}
<C>__{brian speer }
<D>__{it was an affair, an attraction. sex. and she got sort of... carried away with the whole thing, and i guess i went with it. i mean, i didn't exactly say no to things. i should have. i love my family.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{then i guess it's all working out. her lips are sealed, and you don't have to go through the trouble of dumping her.}

<A>__{dr. herman hands her a little squeaky rubber octopus she pulls from her pocket.}
<C>__{dr. herman }
<D>__{that's right. it's an octopus. such a funny creature with its eight legs. but did you know octopi are actually extremely intelligent, like dogs and cats? they have unique personalities, and just like us they have a lot of defense mechanisms. i'm sure you know about the ink sac. she uses ink to confuse her predators. she can camouflage herself. she can emit poison, and some can mimic more dangerous creatures, like the eel. i keep her to remind me of our defense mechanisms our ink, our camouflage, our poison, all the things we use to keep away hurt. the reason dr. johnston invited me here today is to meet you, scottie. i've heard a lot about you.}

<C>__{dr. herman}
<D>__{you're going to have to be a very brave girl right now, and you're surrounded by people who love you. i came to meet you and tell you that if you ever want to talk about what you're feeling, i would like to talk to you too. i can help you face what's going on without all the silly defense mechanisms that work for an octopus but not for us.}
<C>__{dr. johnston}

<D>__{yes, well, they say she's very good one on one.}

<D>__{so mom's going to die for sure?}
<C>__{dr. johnston}
<D>__{yes. we worked really hard with her, but three other doctors and i agree she's in what we call an irreversible coma. do you know what that means?}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{it means she doesn't have a brain anymore.}
<C>__{dr. johnston}
<D>__{not exactly, but... yes, that's the general idea. so we're doing exactly what she wanted us to do if that ever happened. that's why she's not attached to the machines anymore.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{it's for the best, scottie. look at her. she's not happy like this.}
<C>__{dr. johnston}
<D>__{the purpose of medicine is to heal, and we can't do that now.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{do you understand?}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{yes. what will we do with her body?}
<A>__{dr. johnston looks to matt for this one.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{first mom's going to give some of her organs to other sick people, so she can help save their lives. that's a really neat thing she's doing. then we're going to... we're going to scatter her ashes in the ocean. you know how mom always loved the ocean.}
