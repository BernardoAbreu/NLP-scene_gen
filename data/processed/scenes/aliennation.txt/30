<L>__{interior slug mobile day}
<A>__{they're cruising along in downtown traffic. sykes drives. jetson is somewhat cramped in the passenger seat.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{let's talk hubley.}
<C>__{jetson}
<P>__{(refers to a folder he holds)}
<D>__{his body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of central avenue, near downtown.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{with two bri sabot slugs in the chest.}
<C>__{jetson}
<P>__{(gently correcting him)}
<D>__{through the chest. rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(out the window)}
<D>__{nice signal, dickwad!}
<A>__{jetson is momentarily thrown by this outburst from sykes. then...}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{he was employed at the northwest petroleum refinery in torrance. he was manager of the methane facility. he was also a principle partner in a real estate venture to develop low cost housing for newcomers.}
<A>__{sykes grimaces at the mention of "newcomer housing".}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{terrific. a real pillar of the community.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{was hubley missing anything when they found him? was he ripped off?}
<C>__{jetson}
<P>__{(checks file)}
<D>__{there was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{the guys at the mini mart last night made a half assed stab at the money in the till but i don't think that's what they were there for. i think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, george...}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{the murder at the mini mart is not our case. the captain said }
<A>__{sykes looks over at jetson, pissed.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{look, you want to fit in here, right? you want to learn how to get along?}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner. you do for each other. and other people's rules don't mean shit. it's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts. understand?}
<P>__{(jetson nods)}
<D>__{okay. well, my friend and partner was shot last night and i'm after the shitbag that did it. as my partner, i'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.}
<A>__{jetson considers this several moments, then }
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{and as my partner, i ask you to respect me and my desire not to break with procedure.}
<A>__{sykes stares at him, exasperated. without warning, he slams the car to a stop right in the middle of heavy traffic, puts it in "park." jetson, who is already a little too close to the dashboard, bangs up against it. horns instantly go crazy behind them.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{what is wrong?}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(very calm)}
<D>__{nothing's wrong. i just want to get something straight. you agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?}
<A>__{yelling joins the horns outside. jetson is visibly unsettled by the chaos.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{well... yes, quite possibly.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{possibly. good. well, would you be willing to accept the theory, george, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other? does that sound unreasonable to you?}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{yes... no, it is not unreasonable. although i }
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{great.}
<P>__{(a relieved sigh)}
<D>__{well, i'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?}
<A>__{and with that he puts the car in gear and pulls rapidly out.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{i think we're really starting to click now, george hmmm?}
<A>__{jetson doesn't know what to think he just holds on.}
