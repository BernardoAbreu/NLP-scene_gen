<A>__{the place is large and drafty and rundown. a huge american flag hangs from the middle of the ceiling. under it women are laying white table cloths on trestle tables. off to one side a half dozen old men wearing vfw hats are scotch taping paper ribbons to the brick wall. two old men are on stepladders, two more are bracing the ladders and the operation is under the direction of a pair of world war i vets standing side by side. their hands tremble. their four eyes loom huge behind corrective lenses.}

<A>__{suddenly there is a commotion. the women who are setting up the tables all rush to the door as the older women come in with the wedding cake. the older women look half frozen and as they move toward a table the cake receives a great chorus of uhh's and ahh's. suddenly one of the older women collapses. friends rush to her aid, seat her in a chair and give her wine. the woman takes the glass, tosses it off in one swallow and grins. everyone laughs.}
