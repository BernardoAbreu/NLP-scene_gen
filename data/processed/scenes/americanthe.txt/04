<A>__{ingrid leads jack through the trees. her coat has a white fur collar. they are fresh faced and warm from bed. they head towards a vast and frozen lake. jack senses something in the woods. beneath the conifers: impenetrable darkness. jack looks around. thick snow blankets the world and muffles any sound. there is not the slightest breeze.}
