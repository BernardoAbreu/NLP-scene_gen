<L>__{interior fat can's night (same time)}
<A>__{general mcgrath leers down a line up of fat can's girls. just as he gets to the beautiful singer, who looks sick at the thought, suddenly gordon intrudes. he she blocks out the singer, poses coquettishly sucking a lollypop.}
<D>__{mcgrath what's your name, missy? gordon dora}
<P>__{(demurely; back to his falsetto)}
<D>__{dora. would you like to go upstairs? mcgrath oh, indeedy i would.}
<A>__{gordon dora starts to go as the eye crossed reb wakes up. he grabs him her, very pissed.}
<D>__{eye crossed reb hey, c'mere! who the hell are you anyway?! mcgrath she's... mine!}
<A>__{blam! mcgrath emphasizes his claim by gut shooting the reb. the shot makes dora gordon jump and the room go quiet. as the reb crumples, mcgrath turns back to gordon dora, oddly inspired.}
<D>__{mcgrath i feel like... a ditty! gordon dora a ditty? but general...}
<P>__{(trying to be coquettish again)}
<D>__{... my talents really lay elsewhere. mcgrath nothing stokes the fire in my loins like a ditty.}
<A>__{mcgrath hauls him her over to the piano player.}
<D>__{mcgrath you've got some pretty fair lungs on ya, girl, now use 'em!}
<A>__{he punctuates with a slap to gordon dora's rump. the other singer (rita) watches too.}
