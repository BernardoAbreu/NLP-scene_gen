<A>__{trooper eyes him with caution. o'ryan holds his hands in front of his chest, keeping them visible to the guy.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{officer, i am carrying something that could be construed as a weapon. i'd like to hand it over, voluntarily, so you won't think i'm trying to conceal anything. would that be all right?}
<C>__{trooper}
<D>__{what kind of weapon, sir?}
<C>__{o'ryan}

<D>__{i was on my way to the woods. my gear's in the trunk.}
<P>__{(trooper doubts it)}
<D>__{would you like me to hand it to you? i don't know what the procedure is for something like this.}
<C>__{trooper}
<D>__{take the weapon off your hip, place it on the ground, and kick it toward me.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{happy to.}
<A>__{o'ryan takes the knife off his hip. the size of it gets some attention from the trooper.}
<C>__{trooper}
<D>__{what exactly were you planning on hunting, sir?}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{a fifty foot shark.}
<A>__{no reply. o'ryan drops the menacing knife to the ground and kicks it toward the trooper. trooper, slowly, kneels down to get it never taking his eyes off o'ryan.}

<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{oh. sorry. just found myself wondering what was inside that truck.}
<C>__{trooper}
<D>__{sir, i'm going to ask you to hand me the keys to your vehicle, please.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{o'ryan opens the car door. we steal a look inside. ...he's got a gun under the front seat. in a flash, that gun is in his hands and pointing right at the forehead of that trooper. trooper knows he's been had. and he knows that he's about to die...}
