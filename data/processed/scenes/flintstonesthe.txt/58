<L>__{exterior police station night}
<A>__{lava stands in the shadows beside his porscherock. piltdown and pyrite are with him. in the b.g., fred and wilma drive away.}
<C>__{lava}
<D>__{a simple little heist i gave you everything but the keys and you blew it }
<C>__{piltdown}
<D>__{hey, we got the union guys to break in and create a distraction, didn't we? who knew flintstone and rubble would show up, too?}
<C>__{lava}
<D>__{the day after slate city opens there's going to be an audit. if the stuff isn't gone by then we'll all be doing time until the bronze age.}
<C>__{pyrite}
<D>__{don't worry, mister lava... we're on top of it.}
<A>__{they both turn and start down an alley... jamming together as they do. lava sighs... then jumps as barney comes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{excuse me, mister lava ? i think you oughta know... something could be wrong with the fibrerock mix.}
<C>__{lava}
<P>__{(thrown)}
<D>__{how do you know that?}
<P>__{(recovering)}
<D>__{i mean... ah, why do you say that?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{it tastes different.}
<C>__{lava}
<D>__{tastes... different?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{yup. see, ever since i started with fibrerock i mean, since me and fred started with it, i always take a little taste of the fibre foam. and tonight's batch, well... i didn't get much of it, but it seems a little off.}
<P>__{(smacking his lips)}
<D>__{can't fool the old taste buds, heh heh. i think there might be an ingredient missing. so tomorrow, i will run a couple of tests and stuff }
<C>__{lava}
<D>__{rubble, rubble! we're fighting a deadline to finish slate city... and we're not pulling the plug on production to satisfy your tastebuds! if you ask me, you and your tastebuds are overworked ... overwrought... how long have you been with us, anyway?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{nine days, mister lava.}
<C>__{lava}
<D>__{jumping jurrasic, no wonder you're so run down.}
<A>__{he puts his arm around barney, leads him towards the car where betty is waiting.}
<C>__{lava}
<D>__{i'm authorizing a nice vacation for you, rubble. starting tomorrow. you can catch some rays, maybe invent something... hey, how about fibrerock, the sequel, part ii ?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{but }
<C>__{lava}
