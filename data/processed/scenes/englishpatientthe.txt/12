<L>__{exterior italian hill road. day.}
<A>__{kip, the sikh lieutenant, and hardy, his sergeant, explore the road ahead of the becalmed convoy, using saucer like metal detectors and headsets. kip is young, lithe, contained, utterly focused as they inch along the debris strewn road. he stiffens as he registers metal. with a bayonet he carefully scrapes at the mud caked surface. something gleams. suddenly, a pair of feet walks across his vision as hana hurries past, walking carelessly up the road. it's so surreal that neither man registers at first, and then kip is shouting.}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{hey! hey! stop! hey!}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{don't move! stand absolutely still!}
<A>__{hana stops. hardy gingerly follows her footsteps.}
<C>__{hardy}
<P>__{(as he approaches)}
<D>__{good, that's good, just stay still for me and then we're going to be fine.}
<A>__{he arrives at hana. then grabs her. he'd like to slap her face.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{what are you doing?! what the bloody hell do you think you're doing?}
<A>__{by way of an answer she looks at the ground ahead of her feet. jan's bracelet lies in the mud. hardy bends down and collects the mangled bracelet, presses it into hana's hands.}
