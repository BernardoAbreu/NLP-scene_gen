<L>__{3.59 interior paul's room evening}
<A>__{later, a knock on paul's door. no response. jaden pushes the door open a crack, revealing paul lost and alone on his bed in a tiny sliver of light among infinite council house darkness. seen like this, the marks life has left on paul are obvious.}

<D>__{goin' out dad ok?}
<A>__{paul just frowns. he seems too tired to speak. he expresses `come back safely' in a way that is very hard to bear. jaden enters the room. he tucks his old man up in bed safe. then he leaves the room quietly and pulls the door shut safe. he goes downstairs and exits the house quietly. the ceramic christ on the cross in the hallway is silent.}
