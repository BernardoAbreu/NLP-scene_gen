<D>__{here's your driver, this is agent murphy.}
<C>__{new angle}
<D>__{sonny and murphy. sonny eyes murphy, thinks, then begins to frisk murphy. he finds nothing.}
<A>__{he stands up and eyes murphy. he just doesn't like it.}

<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{what can he do, he's clean...}
<C>__{sonny}

<P>__{(to driver)}
<D>__{come on. i will pay you. whatta you want? two hundred? a thousand?}
<A>__{the driver looks around desperately to the fbi, to get him out of this.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{don't look at him. i'm running this.}
<A>__{pause. sheldon finally reluctantly nods. sonny motions for him (the driver) to step forward. before he can get in the car, sonny stops him. signals to him to get ready. gives him a thorough pat search. thighs, the whole bit.}
<B>__{close angles as he searches}
<A>__{it is tense. the driver seems uptight. sonny finds nothing until he touches a breast pocket. the driver is very uptight. sonny reaches in, pulls out a tiny bottle, with a coke spoon chained to the lid. before sheldon can see it, but the audience has, sonny shoves it back, grins, slaps the driver on the buns. the driver laughs delightedly. he was afraid he'd get busted for the dope: the drive will be a cakewalk.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{you'll be okay.}
<C>__{driver}
<P>__{(to fbi)}
<D>__{you men shoot, aim for the white meat!}
<A>__{he loves the joke! they act as though they hadn't heard. sonny slaps him playfully on the arm and smiling turns to sheldon.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i want him.}
<A>__{he points at murphy. sheldon stands there speechless. driver stares at sonny, his smile fading.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(delighted)}
<D>__{what do you think you're dealing with, an idiot!}
<A>__{sheldon nods to driver and murphy. murphy resumes role as driver of the limo. driver gets out.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{so long, copper.}
<B>__{sonny and murphy}
<A>__{as they position the stretchout in front of the bank. it can be seen from inside. the fbi men stand well back from it. murphy stands by the door. he also can be seen.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{okay, sonny? you follow my car.}
<A>__{murphy nods. sonny is satisfied and turns to the bank, takes murphy into vestibule, indicating for him to stay there. sonny continues toward group at rear.}
