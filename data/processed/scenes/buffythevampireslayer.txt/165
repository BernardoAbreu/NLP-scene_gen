<D>__{i don't believe this. the world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?}

<D>__{it's not a mixer. it's the senior dance. and it's important. you wouldn't understand.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{you got that right. i thought you wanted to kill vampires.}

<D>__{i don't want to kill anybody, and i don't want to talk about it anymore.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{listen, i know you're bummed about your friend, and i'm really sorry...}
<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(offhand, almost disdainful)}
<D>__{he did what he was supposed to.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{but, buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{right. i'm the chosen one. and i choose to be shopping.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{i should have known.}
<A>__{buffy raises her fist at him; he starts back, involuntarily.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{leave me alone.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{benny was right. you guys are all exactly the same.}
<A>__{buffy walks away, leaving pike alone.}
<C>__{pike}
<P>__{(continuing; calls after her)}
<D>__{i'm not disappointed, i'm just angry.}
<A>__{as pike walks off, the camera tilts up the lamp post behind them. benny is perched upon it.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{buffy? buffy?}
