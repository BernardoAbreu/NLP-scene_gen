<A>__{harry and linda eat with appetite as they talk.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, i did the whole bodyguard thing for years. my guy was in state, the secretary in fact, so of course i traveled a lot.}
<A>__{harry talks into his sleeve cuff as if into a radio transmitter:}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{..."ironside is leaving the building." we called him iron ass.}
<A>__{linda cackles.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{... not to his face, of course. not to his ass, either!}
<A>__{linda cackles again; harry smiles.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{... ah, he was okay. but, personal protection that's a young man's game.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{you wanna try these dumplings? they're delicious.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{sure...}
<A>__{he reaches but hesitates.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{... does it have shellfood in it?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{shellfood?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{`cause i have this sensitivity. i, uh, go into anaphylactic shock. my larynx swells up, closes off the ah what the hell.}

<C>__{harry }
<D>__{... can't always wear a condom.}
<A>__{linda cackles.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{that's right! not always!}

<D>__{omygod, really!}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(still chewing, he shrugs)}
<D>__{it's no big deal. never discharged it, twenty years service. security blanket now. i don't think about it course, you're not supposed to think about it;}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{in a situation where your man is threatened the training kicks in. muscle memory. reflex those are outrageous.}
<A>__{he stabs another dumpling off linda's plate.}
