<L>__{interior mall janitor's room day}
<A>__{ronnie stands nearby as detective harrison questions an old mexican janitor, who stands by his cart of cleaning products.}

<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{ronnie, we talked about this.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{this is a special circumstance.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{what special circumstance?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{communication skills, watch and learn.}
<A>__{ronnie steps into the forefront.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{que pasa?}
<C>__{janitor}
<D>__{long drawn out conversation in spanish?}

<D>__{more spanish dialogue.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{si.}
<P>__{(to harrison)}
<D>__{yeah, this guy definitely did it.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{what did he say?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i don't know, i don't speak spanish, but judging from his tonal inflections, it's safe to say that he's hiding something. the only question is where.}
<P>__{(to janitor)}
<D>__{okay, ramon, i'm giving you one chance and one chance only to come clean. or else detective harrison is going to come over to your house and deport your whole family back to mexico.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{no, i'm not.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{good cop, bad cop, just play along.}
<P>__{(to ramon)}
<D>__{where are you hiding the jewels?}
<C>__{janitor}
<D>__{no se.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{alright, you're gonna make me be the bad guy here? well, that's a role i'm comfortable playing. let's just see what you're hiding.}
<A>__{ronnie digs through the trash bin that is on the cart. ronnie slings trash out all over the floor. he finds nothing.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{ronnie, that's enough.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{think you're pretty slick, don't you? guess what? i'm pretty slick too.}
<A>__{ronnie takes the cleaning products and opens the bottles. he pours the contents out on the floor. what's he looking for? who knows.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{alright, you're free wait a minute.}
<A>__{ronnie takes the mop and breaks it in half with his foot. he takes the halves and shakes them, thinking that something will come pouring out of the open cylinders. nothing does.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{okay, my mistake. sir, you're free to go. uh, you might want to have someone clean this up which in this case is you, so, uh, chop chop. wouldn't want anyone to slip on this mess.}
<A>__{ronnie leaves the janitor with a bewildered look.}
