<A>__{they leap through to the other side as the door closes.}
<C>__{marvin }
<D>__{ghastly, isn't it?}
<A>__{they whip around to find marvin standing before them.}
<C>__{marvin }
<D>__{i've been ordered to take you up to the bridge. here i am, brain the size of a planet, and they ask me to take you up to the bridge. call that job satisfaction? 'cause i don't.}
<A>__{marvin turns and walks away. they shrug to each other and follow. marvin passes through another door that opens with the same sigh "hhmmaaaahhh"}
