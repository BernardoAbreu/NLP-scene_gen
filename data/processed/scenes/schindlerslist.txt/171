<L>__{interior goeth's villa plaszow night}
<A>__{a tall, thin, gray waffen ss officer has a request for the rosner brothers.}
<C>__{ss officer}
<D>__{i want to hear "gloomy sunday" again.}
<A>__{he's drunk, morose; it seems unlikely he'll be on his feet much longer. indeed, as henry and leo rosner begin the son an excessively melancholy tale in which a young man commits suicide for love the field officer staggers over to a chair in the corner of the crowded room and slumps into it.}
<C>__{scherner}
<D>__{we give you jewish girls at five marks a day, oskar, you should kiss us, not them.}
<A>__{goeth laughs too loud, drawing a weary glance from scherner. schindler smiles good naturedly. he's out, a little worse for wear perhaps, a little more subdued than usual. taking him away from the others, taking him into his confidence }
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{god forbid you ever get a real taste for jewish skirt. there's no future in it. no future. they don't have a future. and that's not just good old fashioned jew hating talk. it's policy now.}
<A>__{the thin gray ss officer is back in front of the musicians, swaying precariously, a drink in his hand }
<C>__{ss officer}
<D>__{"gloomy sunday" again.}
<A>__{again they play the song. again he staggers across the crowded room to his chair in the corner, paying no attention to the visiting commandant from treblinka or anybody else }
<C>__{treblinka guy}
<D>__{ we can process at treblinka, if everything is working? i don't know, maybe two thousand units a day.}
<A>__{he shrugs like it's nothing, or with modesty, it's unclear. goeth is dully impressed; schindler, only politely so.}
<C>__{treblinka guy}
<D>__{now auschwitz. now you're talking. what i got is nothing, it's like a... a machine. auschwitz, though, now there's a death factory. there, they know how to do it. there, they know what they're doing.}
<A>__{again the gray officer wavering before henry and leo. this time they don't wait for him to ask for it }
<B>__{leo rosner}
<A>__{"gloomy sunday" as the man stumbles back to his chair, the rosners not only play the song again, they play with it, and him, this one somber man in the corner staring at them almost gratefully, wrenching from the song all the sentimentality they can, as if they could actually drive him to kill himself. no one else in the room is aware of the exchange going on between them this man and this music which the brothers play as if it were an invocation. eventually, though, someone does become aware, if not of the intention, at least of the repetition, and interrupts the spell }
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{enough jesus god }
<A>__{the music falls apart. the brothers find goeth in the crowd looking at them like, come on, for christ's sake play something else. which they do defeated some innocuous von suppe. goeth turns back to one of his guests. glancing back, as they play, to the corner, the rosners see the gloomy ss officer getting slowly up from his chair. he stands there for a moment, staring at nothing, then slowly makes his way out onto the balcony where he stands in the night air, absolutely still, in silhouette to the rosners. and, ruining a perfectly good party, he takes out a gun and shoots himself in the head.}
