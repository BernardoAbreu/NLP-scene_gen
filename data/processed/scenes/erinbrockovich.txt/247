<A>__{in the wee hours. while her kids sleep, erin sits at the cheap motel room table, going through her forms, organizing, alphabetizing.}
<L>__{interior erin's motel room day}
<A>__{close on erin, fast asleep at the table, her face pressed against the linoleum. there's some noise in the room, whispering. erin stirs and looks around to see george behind her, diapering beth, while matt and katie put their shoes on.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{what time is it?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{real early. we're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.}
<A>__{erin forces herself awake.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{no, i need my car }
<C>__{george}
<D>__{we'll just be a minute. get a little more sleep.}
<A>__{he picks up beth, takes katie's hand, and calls across the room to matthew.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{c'mon, pal. leave that alone, we gotta go.}
<A>__{erin turns to see matthew holding one of her release forms.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{oh, baby, please don't play with that, okay? i got 'em all organized. just put it back.}

<A>__{she replaces the form on top of the stack.}
<C>__{matthew}
<D>__{she's one of the sick people?}
<C>__{erin}

<C>__{erin}
<D>__{cause her own mom's real sick, too.}
<A>__{matthew thinks real hard about this, then heads over to the door, where george, beth, and katie are waiting for him. before he leaves, though, he turns back to erin.}
<C>__{matthew}
<D>__{maybe we'll bring you back some breakfast. you want eggs?}
<A>__{she looks at the group of them, feels their shift toward acceptance. smiles, moved.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{eggs'd be great, baby. eggs'd be perfect.}
