<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{awww, how come?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{well, betty the chick whose house you're at, even though you don't know her leaves me here all by myself on new year's eve. and first thing right off the bat, i'm fucked by a coven of witches.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{an oven full of witches fucked you? is that like at the circus when they stick all those clowns in an itty bitty car?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{a coven. a coven of witches. well, one witch in particular.}
<C>__{margaret}

<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{what's the problem?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{well, admittedly, that was the best part of the night. it was pretty fuckin' cool, actually. but it was still an unnerving way to start off the night.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{sounds to me like a pretty great way to start off the night.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{okay, let's just skip over the witches.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{ skipping over the witches.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{so, later, in another room, some crazy sucking maniac sticks a gun in my face and forces me to play out some psychosexual drama with his wife.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{he made you have psycho sex with his wife?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{no, he didn't make me fuck his wife, he thought i'd fucked his wife! he held me at gunpoint with a loaded gun!}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{what kinda gun?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i don't know, i'm not a gun guy. it was big.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{like dirty harry's gun.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yeah, something like that.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{did it have a real long barrel or a short barrel?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what difference does it make?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{well, for one thing it's the difference between a .44 magnum and a magnum .357.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{who cares if it was a .44 or a .392, it was a fuckin' loaded gun, pointed at my fuckin' head!}
<A>__{margaret takes this in.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{you wanna skip over this part, too?}

<D>__{ted, what's the problem?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what's the problem? i don't got a problem, i got fuckin' problems! wanna hear?}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(yawning, wiping sleep from her eyes)}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{well, most recently, there's room 716. there's a scary mexican gangster dude pokin' his finger in my chest. there's his hooligan kids snapping their fingers at me. there's the putrid rotting corpse of a dead whore stuffed in the springs of a bed. there're rooms blazing afire... there's a needle from god knows where stuck in my leg, infecting me with god knows what, and finally, there's me walking out the fuckin' door right now! buenas noches.}
<A>__{a ringing sound happens that we haven't heard before. ted's head turns toward it. it's the guest board. and the top light, the penthouse, is ringing. it rings where all the others buzzed. betty can hear it distinctly on her side of the line. the sound fully wakes her up. they start talking howard hawks style again.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(suddenly alert)}
<D>__{is that the penthouse?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{that's the chester rush party, they want something.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yeah, well, tough titty. they're just gonna have to wait, 'cause i'm out the door.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(panicking)}
<D>__{now, ted, wait a minute. i know you're freaked, i know you're stressed. you've had a real bad night }
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yes, betty, i've had a real bad night }
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{ you say there's a dead body in a room?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yes, i did.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{no problem, this is a hotel, we've had dead bodies before, it's just the price of doing business. you said the hotel was on fire. is it still on fire?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{no, it's out.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{good, sprinkler system worked like a charm. now, you wanna leave, you've had enough. perfectly understandable. i will take care of everything else. the only thing i ask is that you take care of chester rush. then you can leave.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{now, look }
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{ted, he's a very important guest of this hotel. in fact, he is the most important guest at the hotel. the mon signor used to be a haven for movie stars. through the thirties and forties, and the first half of the fifties, more movie stars if you break it down on a night by night basis stayed at the mon signor than any other hotel in hollywood. now, we had some hard time in the eighties, even though we were the official hotel of cannon pictures, but we're coming back strong in the nineties. and a movie star clientele is important to that comeback. if we can keep stars of his magnitude happy, we're on our way. so, ted, just take care of him, then you can leave.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{look, i don't feel like }
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{he probably just wants some champagne! you can do that, can't you? please just take care of him, the entire staff of the mon signor is begging you!}
<A>__{ted crumbles.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{okay. but get your ass here pronto.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{you're a good man, ted. thanks.}
<A>__{ted hangs up the phone. and picks up the board phone.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{hello, mr. rush. sorry for the delay. how can i help you?}
