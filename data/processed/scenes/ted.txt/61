<L>__{interior club night (flashback)}
<A>__{we see lori out on the dance floor, amidst a sea of dancing clubgoers. nearby, we see john dancing with a girl, and doing it very badly. he's putting too much into it, obviously trying to impress her. the girl is gamely tolerating it, but is clearly not digging the moves. john thrusts his butt back in one move, accidentally bumping a girl behind him with enough force to send her sprawling on the floor. as the crowd reacts to this, we see that it is lori. she starts to get up, when john turns and rushes to help her to her feet.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh my god, are you okay? oh god, i'm so sorry!}
<C>__{lori}
<P>__{(a little stunned)}
<D>__{yeah, i'm... i'm fine.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh jesus, i'm so so sorry! i didn't see you! it was an accident!}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{well, yeah, i... i would hope it was an accident.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{did you hurt your head?}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{um, yes. my head hurts a lot.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh, man. here, let me get you some ice.}
<A>__{she sits down. he reaches into a nearby glass, pulls out a handful of ice, and wraps it in a napkin. he puts it against her head. she inhales sharply for a moment.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{sorry. does it hurt?}
<C>__{lori}
<P>__{(beat, noticing him for the first time)}
<D>__{n... no. no it's okay.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(beat, noticing too)}
<D>__{i'm... i'm john.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{i'm lori.}
<A>__{they smile at each other...}
