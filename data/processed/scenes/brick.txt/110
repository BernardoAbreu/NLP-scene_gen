<A>__{still empty. brendan creeps towards the stairs, passing other doorways, all open but for one. he stops for a moment, listening silence.}
<L>__{interior storage room same}
<A>__{brendan enters the room pitch black but for a small high window. brendan pulls the curtains aside. a beam of sunlight spills just enough light to reveal a figure in the dark. brendan jumps back, and his reflection in the large mirror jumps as well. a white bird nesting in the window flutters into the dark room. brendan walks the large mirror into the beam of light, reflecting it around the room like a flashlight. more junk, a mattress, then a strangely bare corner with a single white lump in it. the white bird stands behind the lump, its dark eyes caught in the bare light. the bird flies out the window. brendan goes to the white lump, a small brick of white powder. white chalky residue patterns the floor there were other bricks there before. behind brendan, in the mirror, something moves. someone else, in the room. tugger. he throws brendan across the room, then heaves him into a wall.}
