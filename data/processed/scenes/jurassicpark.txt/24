<L>__{int ext cruisers, third tour stop day}
<D>__{pre recorded voice ... lots more to see in the herbivore section of our park. but as we come alongside out jurassic jungle river to the left, let's try and catch a glimpse of a very unusual and dangerous carnivore. look across the river and above ...}
<A>__{a lovely mossy clearing. and to the side, bounded just by a thicket of bushes, a precipitous drop to a tropical river, lus h and clear. the river runs fast but it is narrow. on the other side is a sharp rise.}
<D>__{pre recorded voice and there they are!}
<A>__{standing on that natural pedestal and watching our tour come to a stop are two dilophosaurus, man sized dinosaurs with gills that hang around their necks. grant and ellie chime in with the pre recorded voice.}
<C>__{all three}
<D>__{dilophosaurus!}
<A>__{timmy and lex point enthusiastically. regis holds them down with a gentle but restraining arm.}

<A>__{their distinctive hoot drifts across the afternoon air.}
<C>__{gennaro}
<D>__{poisonous d}
<A>__{inosaurs, there's a liability}

<P>__{(assessing)}
<D>__{it's like a gila monster of a cobra. it's a poison ...}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{spitter!}
<A>__{the spitters bound off as grant watches, transfixed. a flock of birds burst from a tree and cross the sky. trees filter the light.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{are we dreaming all this?}
