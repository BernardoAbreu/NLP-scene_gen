<A>__{the door pushes open and nicole comes in with the big book of aa in her hand.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{hey. sorry i'm a little late, but we went for coffee after the meeting...}
<P>__{(whip doesn't look)}
<D>__{whip?}
<A>__{nicole goes close to see whip look at her with a non focused stare. she sees the table and reads the situation. nicole watches as whip stands up. in his oblivion he tries to focus.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{don't, don't, don't! i will get him. knuckles, junior. see him. yeah. i'm not calling again. fuck him. he didn't call. not back. not calling back.}
<A>__{nicole backs away as she watches the blacked out ballet play itself out in slow, tragic fashion. whip motions to his lips as if he is smoking. he freezes and then steps forward and trips in to the coffee table. whip falls to the ground. nicole checks whip's face to see his eyes partially opened but passed out. nicole goes to the bedroom and returns with a blanket that she covers whip with. she also places a pillow under his head making sure that his head is titled to the side so he doesn't choke. nicole looks around the room. she begins to collect the bottles and straighten up.}
