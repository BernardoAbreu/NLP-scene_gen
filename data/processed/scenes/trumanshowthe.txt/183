<L>__{interior studio lot. dusk.}
<A>__{still inside the studio complex, the tram enters the courtyard of an indoor shopping mall. truman gift shops. truman is momentarily frozen by the sight of window displays full of books and board games carrying his likeness with titles such as, "trumantrivia". video cassettes offering "truman highlights". his face emblazoned on t shirts, caps, coffee mugs and posters. even truman dolls and a model of his decaying oldsmobile are offered for sale. the tram slows to a stop behind other trams at the tour's end. studio police are checking the disembarking passengers. truman, using the tour guide as a shield, also exits the tram.}

<P>__{(frightened for his life)}
<D>__{here he is! it's him!}
<A>__{truman contemptuously backhands the guide across the face and makes a run for it. the guards give chase. truman runs into a lookalike mannequin, dressed in a brown suit identical to his own, promoting "trumanwear". he pulls his "double" to the ground to block the guards' path. sprinting along a featureless corridor, he reaches a dead end.}
<C>__{guard}
<P>__{(into radio)}
<D>__{we've got him trapped.}
<A>__{truman enters a doorway marked "no entry" to find a stairway leading upwards. he takes the stairs three at a time. the footsteps and shouts of the guards not far behind. flight after flight of stairs. at one point, he loses his grip on the stair's railing and his gun falls from his hand, clattering for an eternity down the stairwell. he finally emerges on a landing. lungs bursting. one more door. he tries the handle. it opens.}
