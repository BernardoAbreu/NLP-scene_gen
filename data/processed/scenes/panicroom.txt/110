<A>__{ and comes into the hallway. he leans over the stairwell. where he's standing, he is directly under the camera that covers the hallway on the monitors, and can't be seen on the monitor that covers the hallway. in the panic room, meg turns back from sarah, to look at the monitors again. she see burnham is no longer in the bedroom. and doesn't appear to be in the hallway, either.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{oh yes, yes...}
<A>__{she looks at another monitor. on the monitor, she sees junior and raoul in the foyer. in the panic room, meg sits back. that leaves burnham unaccounted for.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{... the hell is he?}
<A>__{in the hallway, burnham is still lingering under the camera. in the panic room, sarah has come forward to the monitors as well.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{do it.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{yeah, but where's the third guy?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{not in the bedroom. do it!}
<A>__{meg goes to the door, raises a hand to the green "open" button. hesitates. in the master bedroom, we see burnham, lurking in the hallway, just about six feet from the door to the panic room. don't open that door! in the panic room, meg wipes sweat from her palm.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{if it looks like i can't get back, just close the door.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{close it!}
<A>__{sarah nods, looks back to the button. in the hallway, a shouted curse rises up from downstairs. burnham takes a step toward the stairs. on the monitors, he suddenly appears, in the hallway. in the panic room, sarah sees it.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{meg freezes. she looks at the monitor, wide eyed. close one. in the hallway, burnham can't take it anymore.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{oh, hell...}
<A>__{he turns and takes off down the stairs. on the monitors, burnham flies down the stairs and appears in the foyer, next to junior and raoul. in the panic room, meg and sarah see all three men accounted for, downstairs.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{go go go!}
<A>__{meg leaps up, runs to the door, and punches the green button.}
