<L>__{interior boathouse (lake) later that day}
<A>__{the abandoned boathouse is a dilapidated structure situated on an isolated shore of the large lake. doug strikes a wooden match, shepherds the flame, leans over, holds the match to his ass and lights a fart. the amorphous blue flame flares and almost instantly disappears as the gas is consumed. victor, doug's partner in crime and best friend, is impressed. (victor is fifteen, too.)}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{jeez louise! how'd you do that?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{intestinal gas produced by bacterial metabolism of food residues in the colon. a mixture of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane. that's the secret ingredient.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{what's so secret about it?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{not everyone can produce methane. it's genetic, that means it's inherited. there's a lot of methane in my family.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{you're full of shit.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{look it up, it's all in the encyclopedia.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{they don't got farts in the encyclopedia.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{hey, they got 'vagina' in the dictionary, they got farts in the encyclopedia.}
<A>__{the roar of a passing speedboat attracts doug's interest.}
<C>__{victor}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{vagina is in the dictionary?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{'a canal leading from the uterus to the vulva'.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{you sure read a lot, man.}
<P>__{(slight beat)}
<D>__{a canal?}
