<A>__{maurice gets up and with a great deal of uncertainty, opens the closet. maurice stares at the collection of hanging dresses. he reaches out and pulls the cloth of a floral dress towards him... he closes his eyes and smells the cloth... his face tightens in pain... both hands cling to the dress tightly... he tries desperately, can't fight it maurice parker begins to cry. his hands grab frantically at the rest of the dresses pressing them to his face and chest.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{oh god... i'm sorry ellen... i'm so sorry...}
<A>__{he hugs the dresses as if they were her. his weeping turns to a torturous wail of grief... all the love, all the anger spilling out in this one moment. he falls to the ground yanking all the dresses down with him they collapse atop him... he buries his face in his wife's clothes... the muffled sound of his cries echoes through the lonely house.}
