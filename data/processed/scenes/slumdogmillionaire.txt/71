<L>__{int exterior first class carriage. morning.}
<A>__{the ancient train is huffing slowly up an incline. a middle class indian couple with their three children are sitting at a table, their breakfast spread before them. into this domestic scene, unseen by them comes jamal. upside down and still outside the train, he is clearly being dangled by his ankles from the train roof. he gives a few, silent directional signs to salim who manoeuvres him across, dips his hand into the open window, snatches a chapatti and signals franticly to be hoisted up. the family continue to eat, unperturbed. then jamal appears again. this time one of the children spots him. despite jamal giving her a friendly wave, she yelps. the father of the group grabs jamal's hand which has just snatched a samosa. there is a tussle, salim holding onto jamal's legs, the father holding onto jamal's arms and jamal in the middle, shouting. salim is losing the battle and his footing. he stumbles and the pair of them fall from the train, rolling and tumbling down an embankment in slow motion. interspersed with the seemingly endless tumble are images of jamal and salim on top of different trains huddled together against the freezing rain... surfing the wind at the front of the train... admiring the distant himalaya....}
<D>__{jamal v o we criss crossed the country from rajasthan to calcutta. every time we were thrown off we got back on again. this was our home for years. a home with wheels and a whistle.}
