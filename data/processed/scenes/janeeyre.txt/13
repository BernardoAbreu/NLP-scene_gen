<L>__{exterior evening. the moor.}
<A>__{dark clouds are banking up; the rain starts again. jane is struggling through a marsh. her boots are stuck. she falls. her hand disappears into mud; her face pressed against the earth. she doesn't move. she has reached the point of despair. the girl's bare feet walk close by, as if waiting for her. jane looks up. where the child should be, she sees a light shining across the moor. jane starts crawling.}
