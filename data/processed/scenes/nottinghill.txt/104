<A>__{as full, sad music plays william begins to walk through notting hill. this walk takes six months... as he walks, the seasons actually and magically change, from summer, through autumn and winter, back into spring... first it is summer summer fruits and flowers a six month pregnant woman honey with another leather jacket boyfriend. as he walks on the rain starts to fall he turns up his coat collar umbrellas appear. followed by winter coats chestnuts roasting christmas trees on sale and the first hint of snow. then he comes to blenheim crescent, which is startling snowscape, for the hundred yard, right across ladbroke grove. by the time he reaches the purple cafe, the snow is melting and in a few yards, it is spring again. he passes honey again arguing with her boyfriend, walking away tearful. then turns past 'the pregnant woman' now holding her three month baby. the camera holds on her.}
