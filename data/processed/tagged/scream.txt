<C>__{man}
<D>__{your call.}

<A>__{another toilet flushes.}
<D>__{girl #2 why would sidney want to be with steve? she has her own bubble butt boyfriend billy. girl #1 maybe she's a slut just like her mom.}
<A>__{inside the stall sidney listens. her face weakening.}
<D>__{girl #2 you're evil. girl #1 please, it's common knowledge. her mother was a trollop.}
<A>__{girl #2 appears from her stall another twit. they both stand in front of the mirror adjusting two snotty faces.}
<D>__{girl #2 cut some slack. she watched her mom get butchered. girl #1 and it fucked her up royally. think about it. it makes perfect sense. her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's god, etc. completely suicidal. and one day she snaps. she wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. and homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.}
<A>__{from the stall, sidney listens, her heart pounding, jaw quivering.}
<D>__{girl #2 where do you get this shit? girl #1 ricki lake.}
<A>__{the two girls exit. sidney moves out of the stall, catching her reflection in the mirror.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{pathetic.}
<A>__{water drips somewhere from a leaky pipe as wind whistles in from the cracked transom above the bathroom door. it sound almost like a whisper, "siddneey..." sidney spins around. what the... she checks out the bathroom. the doors to the stalls are all closed. she bends down and scans beneath them, looking for feet. no one. nothing. sidney turns back to the mirror. suddenly...}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(o.c. whisper)}
<D>__{siddneey...}
<A>__{unmistakable this time. the voice strikes sidney like a nail through the eye. it comes from one of the stalls. she stands thunderstruck, eyeing the stalls thru the mirror.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{is someone there?}
<A>__{a long, morose silence. and then:}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(softly, simply)}
<D>__{it's me, sidney.}
<A>__{sidney spins around. fuck no! he's here. terror floods her face. she eyes the exit door, then the row of stalls she must pass to get to it. she checks under the stalls again. nothing...where the fuck is he? she takes a step forward when... two feet step down from a toilet onto the floor in the last stall. sidney's face draws tight as the stall door begins to creak open. she bolts forward, making a break for it...but slips on the wet floor...her feet flying out from under... sidney reaches out...grabs hold of a sink...saves herself from falling...she glimpses a ghost mask in the mirror coming for her. a hand grabs her shoulder as she slams her body through the exit door...narrowly escaping.}
<L>__{interior corridor continuous}
<A>__{sidney flies out of the bathroom door screaming...burning up the hallway, not looking back. a teacher, hearing her scream, peer out from an open doorway...as sidney sprints by him, not stopping...running madly.}

<B>__{mr. himbry}
<A>__{i'm sickened. your whole havoc inducing, thieving, whoring generation disgusts me. the camera swings around to reveal two ghost masked students standing at attention. mr. himbry rips the mask off of one of the student's heads.}
<C>__{mr. himbry}
<D>__{two students have been savagely murdered. and this is how we express our compassion and sensivity?}
<A>__{he rips the mask off the other student.}
<C>__{mr. himbry}
<D>__{we throw on a mask and dance around campus just hoping someone else gets butchered before we get bored again. you're both expelled.}
<A>__{the ghosts doth protest...}
<D>__{ghost #1 aw, come on, mr. himbry, it was just a joke. ghost #2 yeah, that's not fair.}
<A>__{a deep rooted hostility has taken over mr. himbry's face. neither student budges, scared to even breathe.}
<C>__{mr. himbry}
<D>__{no, it's not fair. fairness would be to rip your insides out and hang you from a tree so you can be exposed for the desensitized, heartless little shits that you are.}
<A>__{suddenly the door bursts open and sidney appears, hysterical.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{he's here...i saw him...he's here...}

<D>__{i know who you are, ma'am. how's the eye?}

<D>__{productive. so they're closing down the school?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{well..uh...yes ma'am. for the time being.}
<A>__{dewey heads for the school building. gale scurries along side him flirtatiously.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{and why is that? has something happened?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{you're not supposed to be here, ma'am.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{i know, i should be in new york covering the sharon stone stalker but who knew? please, call me gale. you look awfully young to be a police officer.}
<A>__{dewey's eyes wander down to gale's long legs, the way her hips move as she walks...he's clearly distracted.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{i'm twenty five years old, ma'am.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{twenty five, huh? in a demographic study i proved to be most popular amongst males, 11 24. i just missed you. of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. does the force require that you work out?}
<A>__{dewey looks away, blushing a bit.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{no, ma'am. because of my boyish good looks, muscle mass has increased my acceptance as a serious police officer.}
<A>__{they approach the school's front entrance. suddenly, mr. himbry's voice in amplified through intercoms across campus via the pa system. they stop to listen.}
<C>__{mr. himbry}
<P>__{(via pa)}
<D>__{"your attention please. due to the recent events that have occurred and until it comes to a resolve effective immediately all classes are suspended til further notice. the bayboro police dept. has also asked me to announce a city wide curfew beginning at 6 o'clock pm. i repeat..."}
<A>__{gale speaks over mr. himbry's voice.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. the killer has yet to strike twice.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{well, we can hope, can't we? we certainly don't have any leads. a ghost mask, a cellular phone not much there.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{we're tracking the cellular phone bill.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{really? you small town guys are good. and have you located sidney's father?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{no, not yet.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{he's not a suspect, is he?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{we haven't ruled out that possibil...}

<D>__{if you'll excuse me, ma'am.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{am i keeping you? i'm sorry.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{that's quite alright. if i may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person.}
<A>__{dewey starts up the school's front steps as the bell rings.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{so you do watch the show?}
<A>__{he turns to her earnestly as students come pouring out the front doors.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{i just turned 25. i was 24 for a whole year.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{you are precious. please, call me gale.}
<A>__{she smiles deliciously, gives him a wink, then struts off as dewey, like a nervous little school boy watches her go.}
<L>__{interior school corridor seconds later}
<A>__{school is clearing out. the halls have begun to empty as tatum escorts sidney down the hallway.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{it was just some sick fuck having a laugh.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{it was him, tatum. i know it.}
<A>__{tatum wants to believe her but...}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{you are not to be alone again. is that clear? if you pee i pee.}
<A>__{stu appears.}

<D>__{is this not cool or what? hey, sid, what happened?}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{for once, stu, drop it.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{okay, but whatever you did the entire student body thanks you.}
<A>__{stu moves to tatum and gives her a kiss.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{and to celebrate this impromptu fall break, i propose we have a party. tonight, my house.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{are you serious?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{my parents are out of town. it'll be like my hurricane bash last year. nothing extreme. just a few of us, hangin'.}
<A>__{tatum warms to the idea.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{this could be good. what do you think, sid?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i don't know...}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{come on. pathos has it's perks.}
<A>__{sidney considers trying hard to be good spirited.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{remember, there's safety in numbers.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(giving in)}
<D>__{yeah, okay...whatever.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{cool. see you guys tonight. bring food.}
<A>__{stu speeds off, sliding down the empty hallway.}
<L>__{interior principal's office later}
<A>__{mr. himbry sits at his desk staring at the ghosts masks before him. he picks one of them up, snickering.}
<C>__{mr. himbry}
<D>__{damn...}
<A>__{he stands and moves to the closet next to his office door. he pulls it open to reveal a mirror hooked inside the door. he tries the mask on, pulling it over his face, looking in the mirror when... a knock at the door stops him. he rips the mask off his head, turns to his office door and opens it to reveal... an empty doorway. he pokes his head into the outer office area and looks around. but no one's there.}
<C>__{mr. himbry}
<D>__{yes? hello?}
<A>__{the place is empty. a little suspicious he closes the door, catching his reflection in the closet mirror. he looks at the mask in his hands. jesus, even he's jumpy. two seconds later... another knock at the door. himbry grabs the door quickly, this time throwing it open. again no one's there. he steps out into the outer office determined to catch a prankster.}
<L>__{interior outer office continuous}
<A>__{completely empty. mr. himbry moves through the outer office and into the school corridor. the overhead lights have been turned off and the corridor is now dark and deserted. he looks up and down the hall. only a janitor is seen in the distance pushing a broom.}
<C>__{mr. himbry}
<D>__{little shits.}
<A>__{mr. himbry returns to his office.}
<L>__{interior office continuous}
<A>__{himbry reenters his office, moving to his desk, when he spots the closet door now closed shut. this gives him a pause he had left it open. hadn't he? suddenly, he can't remember. he shifts uneasy, reaching for the door knob, pulling the door open to reveal... an empty closet. he stands still a moment, suddenly realizing someone could easily now be standing behind the open closet door. nervously, he pushes it shut to reveal... nothing. himbry shakes away his jitters, realizing he's spooked himself. he continues to his desk, pushing his office door shut when... a ghost masked figure lunges from behind it...knife in hand. quick and easy. three quick jabs to the stomach and himbry goes down. the ghost masked figure towering above him.}
<L>__{exterior tatum's house afternoon later}
<A>__{the late afternoon sun is quickly disappearing. tatum and sidney rock on the front porch looking out into the small town neighborhood. dewey's patrol jeep is parked in the driveway. despite loud music, blaring from an inside stereo, this is a quiet moment.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{maybe cotton weary is telling the truth. maybe he was having an affair with your mom.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{so you think my mom was a slut too?}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{i didn't say that, sid. but you know there were rumors. your dad was always out of town on business. maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{if they were having an affair how come that cotton couldn't prove it in court?}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{you can't prove a rumor. that's why it's a rumor.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{created by that little tabloid twit gale weathers.}
<C>__{tatum}
<P>__{(delicately)}
<D>__{it goes further back, sid. there's been talk about other men.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{and you believe it?}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{well...you can only hear that richard gere gerbil story so many times before}
<A>__{you have to start believing it. a long silence as sidney agonizes over all of this. she stands up and moves to the edge of the porch and stares out onto the neighborhood.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{if i was wrong cotton, then he's still out there.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{don't go there, sid. you're starting to sound like some wes carpenter flick. don't freak yourself out we've got a long night ahead of us.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you're right. i'm cracking up. ignore me.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{come on, let's rock.}
<A>__{sid follows tatum inside the house never seeing the ghost masked figure that stands across the street, under a tree. his presence so subtle and unobtrusive you'd have to see this movie a second time to know he was there all along.}
<L>__{exterior main street later}
<A>__{stu is moving along main street when billy comes barreling up next to him.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{how'd you do?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{piece of cake. she'll be there.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{thanks, butt wart. you did good.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{so you gonna try and make up with sid?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{duh...that's quick.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i was just asking. why are you always at me?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{because i'm trying to build your self esteem. you're far too sensitive.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{oh....}
<A>__{billy thumbs stu's forehead.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{you ready to party hard tonight?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{you know it.}
<A>__{they come to a building centrally located in the heart of main street. a huge, blue monstrosity that's bigger than the local bank and post office combined. the sign in front reads}
<B>__{blockbuster.}
<L>__{interior blockbuster continuous}
<A>__{you typical blockbuster huge and crowded. randy, in his blockbuster get up, is busy reshelving returns when stu appears knocking the videos out of his hand.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{jesus, this place is packed.}
<C>__{randy}
<P>__{(picking up videos)}
<D>__{we had a run in the mass murder section.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{you coming tonight?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{yeah, i'm off early curfew you know.}
<P>__{(looking off)}
<D>__{now that's poor taste.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{randy refers to billy who stands down the aisle talking to two girls. (the twits from the bathroom perhaps.)}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{if you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{it was all a misunderstanding. he didn't do anything.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{you're such a little lap dog. he's got killer printed all over his forehead.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{the why'd the police let him go?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. this is standard horror movie stuff. prom night revisited.}
<A>__{randy moves down the aisle, reshelving videos.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{there's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. that's the beauty of it all. simplicity. besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{so what's his reason?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{maybe sidney wouldn't have sex with him.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{she's saving herself for you.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{could be. now that billy's tried to mutilate her, you think sid would go out with me?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i think her father did it. how come they can't find his ass?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{because he's probably dead. his body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere...eyes gauged. see, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch prom night they'd save time. there's formula to it. a very simple one. everyone's always a suspect the father, the principal, the town derelict...}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{which is you...}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{so while they're off investigating a dead end, billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(o.c.)}
<D>__{how do we know you're not the killer?}
<A>__{randy spins around to find billy right behind him. busted.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{uh...hi, billy.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{maybe your movie freaked mind lost it's reality button?}
<A>__{randy shrugs, laughing it off.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{you're absolutely right. i'm the first to admit it. if this were a scary movie, i'd be the prime suspect.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{and what would be your motive?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{it's 1995 motives are incidental.}
<L>__{exterior main street little later}

<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{a party? mom's gonna kill you. then me.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{don't be so self righteous. it's just a little blow out we'll be perfectly safe.}
<A>__{sid stares out the window. closed signs fill the storefronts, a few people rush to their car, in a hurry to beat curfew.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{god, look at this place, it's the town that dreaded sundown.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{hey, i saw that movie. true story, 'bout some killer in texas.}

<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{oh, god...}
<A>__{dewey comes to a stop, parking the car in front of the police station. he looks to sid with a brotherly smile.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{i see you as a young meg ryan myself.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{thanks, dewey. but with my luck they'd cast tori spelling.}

<D>__{i will just be a few minutes. don't go far.}

<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{is billy going to be there tonight?}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{he better not be. i told stu to keep his mouth shut. i think we can live without everybody's all american for one night.}
<A>__{they approach the grocery store. small and simple. sid and tatum grab a shopping cart from the bin and enter the store, pushing the cart through two sliding glass doors. a lone checkout lady behind the counter, big and frumpy, looks up from counting money.}
<C>__{check out lady}
<D>__{you girls gonna have to hurry it up. we're under curfew.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{two minutes tops.}
<A>__{they make a bee line for the junk food section just as the automated doors slide shut behind them and a... ghost masked figure appears, out of nowhere, standing just outside, watching, quietly through the glass store windows.}

<D>__{keeping my eye on sidney.}
<C>__{sheriff burke}
<D>__{listen up, dewey, because it's bad. real bad. aircomp just faxed us. the calls were listed to neil prescott sidney's father. he made the calls with his cellular phone. it's confirmed.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?}
<C>__{sheriff burke}
<D>__{there's more. guess what tomorrow is? the anniversary of his wife's death. it all fits. he's our man.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{have you contacted the bureau?}
<C>__{sheriff burke}
<D>__{they believe he's out of state by now. we'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. if he's not picked up by morning we'll do a house to house.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{you think he could still be in town?}
<C>__{sheriff burke}
<D>__{he'd have to be crazy. where's sidney?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{she's with my sister. should i bring her in?}
<C>__{sheriff burke}
<D>__{hold off for now. just stay close to her.}

<A>__{sidney and tatum push a basket through the junk food section. the store is completely empty. the girls gab freely.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{billy's right. whenever he touches me, i just can't relax.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{you have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. it's no big deal. you'll thaw out.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{but he's been so patient with me, tatum. you know, with all the sex stuff. how many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{billy and his penis don't deserve you.}
<A>__{sidney grabs some chips and salsa from the shelf. down the aisle, through the storefront window the ghost masked figure still stands watching their every move.}

<A>__{sid pushes the cart out of the glass door with tatum riding it. the ghost masked figure is nowhere to be found.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what do you think about when you're having sex?}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{with stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. but sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, i think about grant goodeve.}
<A>__{sid pushes the cart and tatum across the street.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{grant goodeve the oldest brother on eight is enough. remember that show? he was the one who lived off alone. he would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." he had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from charles in charge. god, i was in love with grant, he was so hot. the show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. grant goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{how does that get you in the mood with stu?}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{during foreplay, i sing the theme song to myself. "eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." it's a real turn on.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{no way.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{grant wrote the song himself. i'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "eight is enough..."}
<A>__{sid pushes the cart up to dewey's jeep. tatum hops off.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what secret meaning? like a satanical thing?}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{watch the show, sid. his basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{tatum!}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{oh, sidney. what? a guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. watch out.}
<A>__{sidney stops just short of a laugh. tatum pulls the back jeep door, loading the groceries in. behind her, the ghost masked figure appears, just out of their sight, behind the jeep's open back door.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{there's that sense of humor. i knew it still existed. ohh, sid, let's have some fun tonight.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{deal.}
<A>__{sidney moves to the back door and closes it shut, when from behind... dewey stands. sid jumps, startled.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{you girls ready.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{looks like i'm your personal bodyguard tonight, sid.}
<C>__{tatum}

<D>__{sorry, police orders. i will stay out of the way, i promise.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{tatum kicks the shopping cart out of the way, blindly. it rolls down the road by itself, gaining speed on a decline running smack into the ghost masked figure who stops the cart cold with one hand.}
<L>__{exterior country road night}
<A>__{dewey's jeep makes it's way down a long, winding road. headlights illuminate the thick woods that line each side. following behind them at a discreet distance is a huge white newsvan. dewey comes to the end of the road. it dead ends at... stu's house which sits alone in a clearing, big and ominous with no neighbors in sight. a huge old home just ripe for a night of fun and...terror. from the looks of things the party has already started. music is blaring. a few kids hang on the porch.}
<L>__{interior living room minutes later}
<A>__{a big room with kids sprinkled throughout smoking, drinking, cutting up. a stereo blasts music while the tv airs around the clock killer coverage. tatum and sid enter with groceries. various friends greet them.}

<D>__{caterer's here.}
<A>__{the girls carry bags through a hallway that opens up onto an enormous kitchen. stu and some guys are leaning over the sink drinking beer through a funnel.}

<D>__{what's the plan?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.}
<A>__{kenny picks up a compact video camera the size of his fist. he checks its battery pack.}
<C>__{kenny}

<D>__{what's the delay?}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{about thirty seconds.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{as long as it records i don't give a shit. we're not doing a remote.}
<A>__{gale slides open the side door and steps out into the darkness, not seeing the figure that stands behind her. a hand grabs her shoulder, gale's heart stops as she spins around to find... dewey, smiling, extremely pleased to see her.}

<D>__{evening, ma'am.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{deputy...good evening.}

<C>__{gale}
<D>__{then what are you doing here?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{keeping an eye on things. checking the place out.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{mind if i join you?}
<A>__{dewey considers for a whole two seconds.}

<L>__{interior garage}
<A>__{the kitchen door opens and light floods the darkened garage. tatum stands in the doorway searching for a light switch. she finds a button and hits it. brrrrmmm! the electric garage door starts to rise. wrong switch. she hits it again and it closes. she finds another switch. click. a small lightbulb overhead comes on, barely lighting the large two car garage, leaving pockets of shadows along the wall. tatum spots the refrigerator against a far wall and heads for it, not seeing the kitchen door, quietly, slowly, closing behind her, sealing her off from the rest of the house. tatum stumbles to the refrigerator and throws it open. its light casts a glow across her face. crash boom! tatum jumps, spinning around just in time to see a cat escape through a large pet door that's built into the garage door. she smiles at her jumpiness. tatum loads up with as many beer as her hands will carry and heads back to the kitchen. at the kitchen door, she juggles the beer, reaching for the knob. it's locked.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{she kicks it with her foot several times.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{hey, shitheads!}
<A>__{a moment. no answer.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{oh, shit piss!}
<A>__{tatum leans over and, with her elbow, hits the garage door button. brrrmm! it begins to rise. she moves towards the rising door, beer in hand. suddenly, crr brrrm! the garage door resets, reversing direction, moving down, closing.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{what the...}
<A>__{tatum spins around to see..}
<B>__{a ghost masked figure}
<A>__{silhouetted in the dark, next to the kitchen door, his hand on the switch. tatum at once gasps, taken back, but then relaxes.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{is that you, randy? cute.}
<A>__{the figure stares at her, blankly.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{and what movie is this from? i spit on your garage.}
<A>__{tatum takes a step towards the figure.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{lose the mask. if sidney sees it, she'll flip.}
<A>__{the figure shakes his head slowly from side to side.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{oh, you wanna play psycho killer?}
<A>__{the figure slowly nods.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{can i be the helpless victim?}
<A>__{the figure slowly nods again.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{okay, let's see. "no, please don't kill me, mr. ghostface. i want to be in the sequel."}
<A>__{tatum takes a step to move around the figure, but he steps too, blocking her.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{cut, casper. that's a wrap.}
<A>__{tatum moves again, sidestepping the figure, but he's faster and cuts her off. tatum juggles the beer against her chest with one hand and with the other pushes the figure hard, knocking him aside.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{randy will you stop?}
<A>__{but as the figure intercepts, lunging forward, grabbing her wrist hard, tatum stumbles...beer cans hit the floor, spewing...}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{you little shit.}
<A>__{tatum yanks hard, releasing his hold when a flash of silver catches her eye. she looks down, glimpsing a long sharp blade as it darts forward, cutting into her forearm... tatum pulls back, horrified, as the moment turns deadly serious. the figure advances on her knife out, ready. she staggers backwards, holding her bloody arm, backing into the refrigerator,}
<B>__{screaming.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{the figure lashes out with the knife. tatum dodges it, leaping back against the fridge. the figure advances. instinctively, she rips the top freezer door open, bashing the figure in the face, sending him backwards, reeling. tatum bolts to the...closed garage door. in a panic, she beats and pulls on it, trying to make it lift. she eyes the figure...he's recovering... she goes for the pet door, dropping to the floor, diving for it...she wedges her upper body through, her head, shoulders, torso just as the... figure pounces, grabbing hold of her feet. tatum goes crazy screaming and kicking trying to get through.}
<L>__{exterior garage door}
<A>__{tatum is half in half out of the pet door. she beats and jerks wildly, unable to see the figure on the other side... a true fighter, tatum kicks hard, making direct contact with the figure, knocking him away. she takes the moment to pull herself through further...but she stops...stuck. she pulls and tugs but can't move. she listens but hears nothing. where did he go? an agonizing silence. and then... crr brrrm! the garage door is activated. it begins to rise upward, taking tatum with it. she screams madly.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{noooooooo.....}
<A>__{tatum's arms and legs fly about violently as she tries to free herself from the door, but it moves too fast, carrying her up... she looks above to see where the door rolls back into garage rafters just as her neck hits the first beam, snapping instantly.}
<L>__{interior foyer minutes later}
<A>__{it's getting late and some kids leave through the front door, muttering, "parents and curfew", etc. the door hangs open wide. sid moves to close it when.... billy appears in a classic fake scare.}

<A>__{stu appears.}
<C>__{stu}
<P>__{(with a wink)}

<D>__{subtlety, stu. look it up.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{it's okay. we need to talk.}
<A>__{sid grabs his hand and leads him up the staircase. randy appears from the kitchen just in time to see sid and billy disappear upstairs.}

<C>__{stu}
<D>__{he came to make up.}

<D>__{so...i'm sorry. i've been a selfish shit and i'm sorry.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{no, billy. i'm the one who's been selfish and self absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{you lost your mom...}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{but you're right enough is enough. i can't wallow in the grief process forever and i can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.}
<A>__{billy bows his head quietly, knowingly.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way i'm scared i'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? like the bad seed or something...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{oh sidney...}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{everytime i get close to you i see my mom. i know it doesn't make sense.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{sure it does. it's like jodie foster in silence of the lambs when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{but this is life. this isn't a movie.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{sure it is, sid. it's all a movie. life's one great big movie. only you can't pick your genre.}

<C>__{billy}

<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{or even a good porno.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{she stares at him, her eyes sexually charged.}

<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{are you serious?}
<C>__{sidney}

<L>__{interior living room minutes later}

<D>__{not until trading places in '83. jamie lee was always the virgin in horror movies. she didn't show her tits until she went legit.}
<C>__{boy teen}
<D>__{no way.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{that's why she always lived. only virgins can outsmart the killer in the big chase scene in the end. don't you know the rules?}
<A>__{stu finishes his beer.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{what rules?}
<A>__{randy hits the pause button on the remote and stands in front of the television, explaining.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{there are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. for instance: 1. you can never have sex. the minute you get a little nookie you're as good as gone. sex always equals death. 2. never drink or do drugs. the sin factor. it's an extension of number one. and 3. never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "i will be right back."}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{wanna another beer?}

<L>__{interior living room seconds later}
<A>__{back in the living room, the horror fest continues when the phone rings. everyone ignores it. it rings again. finally, randy grabs the receiver from the side table.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{hello? yeah....holy shit.}
<A>__{randy, freaked, drops the phone, finds the tv remote and pauses the movie, the others protest "hey, put is back..." etc.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{listen up. they found principal himbry dead. he was gutted and hung from the goal post on the football field.}

<A>__{kenny is barely watching the monitor, he reached boredom some time ago. he finds a bag of cheetos and chows down when he hears screaming from outside. he peers out the window to see the last of the party kids pile into two cars and race off down the road. he chews a cheeto slowly, his interest piqued.}
<L>__{interior bedroom minutes later}
<A>__{the sex is over...and both sid and billy are dressing respectively. that post sex awkwardness. sid brushes out her hair as her eyes come to rest on the telephone on the nightstand...it puzzles her as a stark reveleation crosses her face. she turns to billy who sits on the floor, putting on his shoes.}

<C>__{billy}
<D>__{you don't still think it was me?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{no, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. using your one phone call to call me so i wouldn't think it was you.}

<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{billywatchout!!!!}
<A>__{billy barely turns as a long steely blade rises high in the air. it strikes down with force...hitting his chest as blood sprays the air. on sidney as red crimson splatters across her face...as the knife is thrust in and out of billy who tries hard to put up a fight..but it's useless...he never had a chance. his body falls to the floor..lifeless.}
<B>__{angle on ghost}
<A>__{as he watches billy's body come to a still before quietly, calmly turning his attention to... sidney who stands, numb...scared to death. and only when the ghost takes a step forward does sidney break. she takes off like a rocket...leaping over the bed and out the door.}

<L>__{interior dark space continuous}
<A>__{total darkness. sidney's hands scour the wall for a light switch. the doorknob turns...the lock holds..as the door is nearly shaken from it's hinges...and then... nothing. all goes silent. only sidney's rapid breathing fills the space around her. sidney, trembling, shaking, reaches above her, feeling, until she finds a string. she pulls it...as a lightbulb switches on overhead. she's in a small box of a room. the door is on one side, a small, narrow staircase on the other. she eyes the doorknob, then the staircase...contemplating...but it's an easy decision. there's no fucking way she's going up to the attic. she unlocks the door and pushes on it. but it won't give...she pushes on it again. it's locked from the other side. shit. she turns to the staircase.}

<D>__{i'm gonna rip you up bitch. just like your slut whore mother.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{gotta find me first, you pansy assed mama's boy.}
<A>__{billy starts ripping the room up, overturning furniture in a mad fit of rage...when he notices the hall closet. touche! he smiles deliriously, heading for it, ripping it open as... a ghost masked figure strikes from within, with an umbrella, the sharp end hitting him in the chest as it fans out. billy stumbles back, stunned, as the ghost comes at him again...the umbrella lodges in his chest, and he goes down. sidney rips the ghost mask off her head. she looks at billy, disgusted, throwing the mask on billy's now still body. a movement behind her sends her reeling around to find... randy slowly sitting up. his body drenched in blood. he's alive...barely. he looks to sidney...through pain...}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{you know what i hate most about horror movies? the final scene...it just goes on and on...and it gets so stupid...}
<A>__{randy manages to stand when a figure comes leaping at him, completely unexpected...it's stu...barreling into him...they fall back into the living room. sidney grabs the gun next to billy and turns to the living room to find... randy and stu rolling across the floor in a dead lock, fighting, both seriously injured...sid tries to find aim when a... hand grabs hold of sidney's ankle, toppling her to the floor...once again she finds billy on top of her...}
<B>__{in the living room}
<A>__{randy and stu pound at each other, beating and clawing... on sidney as she fights viciously, attacking with everything she's got... randy is desperately trying to pry away from stu...he grabs hold of the television set and tries to pull himself off the floor out of stu's clutch... his hands find the top of the tv...the vcr...he yanks on it, gripping it with his hands, bringing it around with force crashing the vcr into stu's head. stu drops. on sidney as she digs her hand into billy's open chest wound. he cries out bloody murder. her other hand brings the gun up to his face...but he head bunts it out the front door...suddenly a flash of silver appears above sidney. billy has grasped the butcher knife...he rises it high above sidney ready to strike...when a bullet rips through the foyer striking billy knocking him back into the living room. sidney looks up to see... gale weathers, holding the gun in a death grip as smoke rises above the gun's chamber. sidney sits up as gale moves to her, helping her. their eyes meet. a life truce.}
<L>__{interior living room continuous}
<A>__{billy and stu lay face up, head to head. sid and gale move over them, staring down. randy joins them.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{sid, you found me out...i'm a virgin. and pretty happy about it right now.}
<A>__{sidney nudges their bodies. they both stir.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{careful. this is the moment when you think the killer's dead, but then he springs back to life for one last scare.}
<A>__{sidney grabs the gun from gale.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{not this time.}
<A>__{she positions her foot on stu's chest and aims.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{this is for my mom, asshole.}
<A>__{she shoots him in the forehead, a clean and perfect shot. the she aims the barrel at billy who's eyes suddenly open, blinking up at her, blood bubbling from his lips. he's not yet dead. their eyes lock.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{and this billy stud bucket is for having an incredibly small weenie.}
<A>__{she fires another perfect shot. they're both goners. sidney drops the smoking gun, standing silent over the bodies. a quiet moment when suddenly...}
<B>__{a figure lunges at them}
<A>__{both sid and gale and randy scream in epic, final scare proportions as mr. prescott leaps forward, still bound and gagged. sid catches her breath, relaxing.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{oh daddy...}
<A>__{she rushes to him, untying him...while gale moves to the bookcase and retrieves the hidden camera.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{i wanna close up.}
<A>__{randy appears by sidney's side, helping her untie her father.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{this is probably an inappropriate moment, but you think you'd want to maybe go out with me sometime... like on a date?}
<A>__{sidney looks at him, dumbfounded.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{maybe catch a movie?}
<A>__{a long moment as sidney's face goes from disbelief to resignation to the slight trace of a smile.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{only if it's a nice meg ryan movie.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{you got it.}
<A>__{he smiles at her...watching as sidney grabs hold of her father, holding him tight as gale weathers, with camera in hand, gets one hell of an ending to this scary movie.}
<C>__{the end}
