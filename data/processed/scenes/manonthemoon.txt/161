<L>__{interior mid south coliseum seconds later}
<A>__{and ding! that's the bell! andy strikes a threatening pose. lawler takes a step forward and andy instantly, cowardly, runs for the ropes and jumps out of the ring. booooo!!! andy grins at the crowd and points at his brain: i'm smarter.}
<C>__{announcer }
<D>__{and kaufman's left the ring! lawler's waiting for him to return.}
<C>__{lynne}
<P>__{(to zmuda)}
<D>__{is this a strategy?}
<A>__{lawler disparagingly frowns. the ref checks his watch. andy crosses to the opposite end of the ring, gauging his rival... then slowly climbs in until the second lawler moves. then andy leaps back out!}
<C>__{announcer }
<D>__{and kaufman's left the ring again! he doesn't seem interested in actually making contact with his opponent.}
<A>__{andy struts around the floor, pointing to his brain. he smirks at various spectators... until he finds himself face to face with his parents. an unexpected moment. andy's finger frozen on his brain. janice shakes her head despairingly.}
<C>__{janice}
<D>__{andy, please. let's go home!}
<A>__{cameras flash. the paparazzi love these moments.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{don't worry, mom. i will make you proud...!}
<A>__{beat then andy gets hit in the head with a cup. people hoot. disoriented, andy returns to the ringside. lawler is losing his patience.}
<C>__{lawler}
<D>__{hey! did you come down here to wrestle, or to act like an ass?}
<A>__{andy paces around, unsure of his next move.}
<C>__{lawler }
<D>__{look... if you get in here, i will give you a free headlock.}
<A>__{lawler leans down and offers his neck. andy peers skeptically. people jeer. andy looks at waiting lawler... then tentatively climbs in. as promised, lawler doesn't move. so andy crosses over and grabs lawler's head! andy grins triumphantly. he squeezes his arms tight, muscles flexing, riding high on this moment. until lawler stands and flips him over. andy slams down on his back. crunch!}
<C>__{announcer }
<D>__{it's a side suplex!!}
<A>__{andy lies on the mat, unmoving. lawler doesn't care. he picks up andy's prone body and grips it upside down. janice covers her eyes. stanley is worried.}
<C>__{referee}
<P>__{(frantically gesturing)}
<D>__{no! no!}
<A>__{lawler disregards the ref and slams andy's head in a pile driver!! a horrible thud. ding! the bell immediately rings. janice opens her eyes and screams.}
<C>__{janice}
<D>__{jesus christ!!!!!}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{why isn't he moving??}
<A>__{andy's parents' reaction is a fiesta for photographers.}
<C>__{announcer }
<D>__{lawler has committed a piledriver, which is an automatic disqualification! match goes to kaufman by disqualification, after two minutes, twelve seconds!}
<A>__{andy is splayed unconscious. raging lawler promenades around the ring, arms over his head. the crowd shouts crazily, rooting him on. lynne runs to the ropes, screaming for help.}
<C>__{lynne}
<D>__{andy!!!}
<P>__{(frantic)}
<D>__{somebody get a doctor!}
<C>__{zmuda}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{we need a stretcher!!}
<A>__{stanley, totally numbed, holds janice. they're on the verge of collapsing. tons of commotion. cameras flash blindingly. a stretcher is lifted into the ring. andy is loaded on. music fights the deafening noise. bedlam. andy is carried through the crowd, followed by his entourage. a soft object hits stanley on the head.}
