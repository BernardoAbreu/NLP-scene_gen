<A>__{she grabs an in flight magazine and opens it up to an ad for wristwatches. it reads; "in the sky, he is the one man everyone can trust" and shows a picture of gru giving the thumbs up in a cockpit.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{say what?}
<A>__{lucy reacts, shakes her head, and now the picture is just a regular airline pilot in the cockpit. lucy turns the page. it's another ad, saying simply "gru now!" and showing a picture of a muscular gru diving from a waterfall. she gasps and slams the magazine shut, then slowly reopens it to find the picture is really just a random muscular guy diving. it says "go now to hawaii!"}

<D>__{would you like some peanuts or pretzels?}
<A>__{lucy looks up from her magazine to see the flight attendant, who looks like gru. she reacts. then looks across the aisle and sees a lady that looks and sounds like gru, talking to another man who looks like gru.}
