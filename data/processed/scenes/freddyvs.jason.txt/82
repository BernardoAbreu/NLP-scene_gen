<L>__{exterior eternal peace cemetery night}
<A>__{headlights skew across a rusty iron gateway eternal peace cemetery illuminating a sign: trespassers will be shot! meagan, jesse, stormie, and erwin enter the shadowy cemetery carrying lamps with shovels over their shoulders. as they search through the cemetery, meagan asks:}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{what's the story on jason voorhees anyway?}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{where have you been? jason was that guy who ran around in a hockey mask, chopping up camp counselors, duh?}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{i knew that. what i mean was why?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{it started a long time ago, back in the fifties, when jason drown at camp crystal lake. his mother went berserk and started killing the counselors.}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{she got her head chopped off by one of the girls she was trying to kill!}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{right. and then jason came back from his watery grave to get revenge.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{he came back from the grave?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{yeah. chopped up a number of people before they finally caught up to him.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{what happened to him then?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{they killed him.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{how can you kill somebody who's back from the grave?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{not very well apparently. jason keeps coming back to life and chopping people up. it's a never ending cycle of terror up here at crystal lake a real problem.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{why does he keep coming back to life and killing people?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{they say he's looking for revenge on the camp counselor who murdered him as a child. jason just happens to go about it in the socially unacceptable way of hacking through every teenager he finds until he gets the right one.}
<P>__{(spots grave)}
<D>__{here it is...}
<A>__{erwin shines his light on jason's grave. angle on tombstone jason voorhees. born:1945. died:1953. beneath the death date, crudely scratched into the stone: 1981, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1988, etc. jesse and erwin start digging. ellipsis cemetery statues watching them dig. stormie and meagan take their turn. then... jesse hits something solid. hands brush away the remaining dirt, exposing the coffin below. jesse takes a sharp breath and then jams a crowbar under the lid forcing it open. the casket lid cracks open a bit when ssssss! noxious gas escapes. everyone covers their mouth and nose, suppressing the urge to hurl. then roaches... hundreds of roaches. meagan and stormie run off, screaming, batting at their hair and clothing. jesse rolls around on the ground. erwin sighs, plucks a roach off his shirt, and calmly eats it.}
