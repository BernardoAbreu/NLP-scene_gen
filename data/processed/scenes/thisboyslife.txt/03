<A>__{two people are in the straining car a woman and her son. the woman is caroline wolff. somewhere in her 30s, she is a pretty woman who can look beautiful if she works at it. (just now, though, her prettiness is marred by a fading bruise on her right cheekbone.) she is bright and energetic and lively. even more important than these qualities, though, is her humor. and most important of all is a sensual quality she exudes. her sensuality is effortless as natural to her as the color of her eyes and hair. men turn on the street to stare at her. the boy is toby wolff. a pleasant faced boy with won derful eyes, he is 13 teetering on the brink of adolescence, so that one moment he seems like a self assured teenager, and the very next like a ten year old kid. just now the ten year old kid has the upper hand: bored and weary with the long trip, toby has been arguing with caroline, who is ignoring him.}

<D>__{... well, i mean it. i'm serious i do. you promise and promise, and then you change your mind, just like that.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(totally oblivious)}
<D>__{... uh huh.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{you wait 'til you ask me for something. just wait. see if you get it.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(as above)}
<D>__{toby, hush. let me just...}
<A>__{so concentrated on her driving she doesn't even finish her sentence, she nurses the car upward. finally the car crests the hill and starts down. caroline sighs with relief. she turns to toby with a smile.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{what'd you say?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i said for the twentieth time if a person promises somebody something, they can't just turn around and take it back.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{oh, honey, jesus. don't start with that again.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{because i'm the mother, and i get to tell you what to do every minute of your life 'til you're eighteen. seriously, we've got no money. i can't buy you the moccasins.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i bet if you'd promised roy some moccasins he'd of got 'em.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{no talk about roy, okay? and ditto the moccasins. we, can't, afford, them.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yeah, but you did promise...}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{sue me. take me to court. oh, toby, i know you're disappointed, but...}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{jack. call me jack.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you're going to drive me to an early grave: i'm never going to make salt lake city.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{seriously. if a person can't get a stinking miserable pair of moccasins, at least he ought to be able to choose his own name...}
<P>__{(loud)}
<D>__{... and i wanna be called jack!}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{fine. and you can call me...}
<P>__{(she thinks)}
<D>__{... jeanette. jeanette marie.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{oh, you're so stupid sometimes, i...}
<A>__{the bawling of an airhorn interrupts him. both of them look through the back window and see a huge tractor trailer truck, out of control, bearing down on them. caroline brakes and steers a hard right, skidding the nash safely onto the side of the road. the truck, its horn blasting steadily, shimmies and slides past them, and then, hideously, fails to make the next curve: it smashes through the guard rails and into empty space, its horn still blaring. caroline and toby look at each other, then scramble out of the car.}
