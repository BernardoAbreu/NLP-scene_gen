<L>__{exterior mckenna house later night}
<A>__{bobby's mustang is backed towards the front of the house. we see a silhouette of bobby and grace carrying something wrapped in a blanket and dumping it in the trunk.}
<L>__{exterior desert highway night}
<A>__{a lone pair of headlights illuminate the night as the mustang cruises through the dark. as the lights brighten the screen we:}
<T>__{fade to:}
<L>__{interior exterior mustang night}
<A>__{grace sits next to bobby peering out the windshield, clutching the money in a backpack. she's humming an indian song.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i can't see it.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it should be just up ahead. hold on ... there! there it is!}
<A>__{a sign illuminated by the headlights. it reads: you are}
<B>__{leaving superior. thanks for visiting.}
<A>__{grace lets out a scream of joy, leans over and hugs him.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{oh, god! i can't believe it. i'm out. i'm finally out!}
<A>__{the mustang begins to swerve along the road.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{hey! take it easy. want to get us killed?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i don't know about that?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you spent a day in superior. i wasted my entire life there. i feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{we've still got some dead weight to get rid of.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{can't we just dump him fast someplace?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i want a place where only the vultures will find him...(then) it'll be over soon, grace.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i'm not sailing his boat.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{but i thought }
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{we're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{anywhere?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what the hell? why not? where should we go?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{hawaii. i've read all about it. i've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. oh, god. i'd kill to go there.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you already have.}
<A>__{she gives him a funny look.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you know i thought you'd left me back there.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{when i got back from the garage, and your jeep wasn't there, i thought you'd gone and left me and taken the money.}
<P>__{(off her look)}
<D>__{...cause i never had any luck with women, grace. you don't know what i been through. the shit i've taken. i thought you were like the rest of 'em... but when you came out of the house... well you're here grace and we might be starting in the shit but we're starting where i never been together with someone together with you grace.}
<A>__{she responds with a luminous smile.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i love you bobby.}
<A>__{he looks back at her with trust and love in his eyes.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{we're gonna pull this off, grace.}
<A>__{just then a headlight rakes them from the rear as we hear, again, the ominous crackle of a police radio and the short brutal "whoop" of the siren, as sheriff potter's vehicle rolls up quickly behind them. grace's face is caught like a surprised deer in the headlamps.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{oh, my god!}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{don't stop!}
<A>__{bobby is in a bind. the siren whoops again. the lights flash to highbeam.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{he must've seen us swerving on the road, that's all, just gonna give us a ticket for swerving...}
<A>__{but even bobby has trouble believing that as the police vehicle pulls out sharply alongside his and sheriff potter motions to him aggressively to pull over on the shoulder.}
<C>__{sheriff }
<D>__{pull over, goddamnit, pull over!}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{keep going!}
<A>__{she seems to be panicking. bobby pulls over.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{fuck this!...just shut up, grace. we done nothing! be cool. let me do the talking. he doesn't know anything.}
<A>__{his vehicle pulled up on the shoulder in front of them, the sheriff gets out, shining his power flashlight into their faces.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{'evening sheriff, sorry bout that but this jackrabbit...}
<A>__{bobby has no time to react as the sheriff is suddenly there at his window, jerking his door open, angry. a gun in his hand, pointed at them, his eyes on grace.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{you had to fuck him , didn't you!}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{i would never do that to you, baby... he killed jake said he'd kill me if i didn't come with him. all he wants is the money.}
<A>__{bobby looks at her. he cannot believe what he just heard.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what!}
<C>__{sheriff}
<P>__{(flipping, yelling)}
<D>__{don't lie to me !}
<A>__{grace knows the jam is up.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{ok...but he never made me cum! really virgil, i was only doing what i had to do so we could be free. just like we talked about. it meant nothing .}
<A>__{a pause. virgil wants to kill her, but he also wants her back badly.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you fucking him too grace? is everybody fucking everybody in this town?}
<A>__{she ignores him. her attention on the backpack with the money between her legs the gun is there, inside an outer flap of the bag.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{you fuck this guy get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{no baby, you got it wrong.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{this road don't go to globe, grace where were you going to meet me?}
<A>__{his flashlight on the four suitcases in the backseat. she doesn't have an answer to that one.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it's not like that it... look, virgil, i got the money here.}
<A>__{she gets out of the car on her side, comes around to him, the pack of money slung on her shoulder, hard to see in the dark.}
<C>__{sheriff }
<D>__{oh grace, you can say what you want...but, i watched you fuck that pervert for years while you're telling me you loved me? what happened to going to milwaukee together? you and me gonna open up the finest sporting goods store that city ever did see? get us a place on the north shore, by the lake? season brewer tickets! just you and me, grace. what happened?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{all talk, that's all you did was talk, and all i did was sit around getting older waiting for you to free me! you never did nothin' virgil, you're weak! (pointing to bobby) he did !}
<A>__{the sheriff, deeply wounded, casts a hot vicious gaze on bobby.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{this is some girl you and me got here bobby, yessir, an excellent cocksuck too, wouldn't you say? (back at grace)... course you had a lotta practice haven't you darling, going way back to your crazy mama!}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{shut up, virgil! take your share of the money. it's not so bad.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{i don't want the fuckin' money! i'm not gonna give up everything i got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. it's you . you grace or nothing. the whole thing... i want you to be my wife...(hopeful). what do you way grace?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you sound just like jake... i did see into the future, virgil, but you weren't in it. go back to your family. they love you.}
<A>__{bobby gets out of the car, misunderstanding the situation.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{look, we got more. we got $200,000 at least. split it three ways, we all walk away...}
<A>__{the sheriff snaps and smashes bobby with his flashlight, knocking him to the ground, kicking him again and again, gathering the psychic force to murder him. grace tries to approach.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{shut up, boy! you don't know shit round here! (to grace) get back. did she tell you that story about the bird flying away?}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{ow! look, i ... ow!}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{stop! stop it!}
<C>__{sheriff }
<D>__{were you going to help her fly away, asshole? what'd you think, you were the first boy to drift through this town she came on to? she tell you the story about old jake forcing her to marry him? that's a good story... how he killed her crazy mama?}
<A>__{bobby in bloody agony. grace stunned that virgil would reveal this now publicly.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{goddamnit virgil, stop! don't!}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{...but i bet the story she didn't tell you was the best story of all. how old crazy jake was really her papa . and she liked fucking papa! and now she's killed the sonufabitch! just like she's gonna kill you!}
<A>__{grace plunges into the pack, pulls the gun and shoots virgil across the car in the gut.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{no...you! you!}
<A>__{the sheriff flies back onto the road, stunned, not realizing what's happened. bobby watches unbelieving as grace quietly steps up over the sheriff. she puts the next round in his nuts, a modern fury enacting ancient wrath.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{grace. no!}
<A>__{the sheriff is wide eyed, dying in shock. grace then fires right at his head in a coup de grace that blows his brains out the back of his head. grace and bobby both stare, then grace jumps into action, dragging the body. she snaps to bobby.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{help me get him off the road. into the car! we'll ditch his car... get the fuck up!}
<A>__{bobby stares at her.}
