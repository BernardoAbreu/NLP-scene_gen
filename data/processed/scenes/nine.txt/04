<L>__{interior production offices, cinecitta day}
<A>__{a long corridor, bustling with activity. the trio heads down it. if a pretty girl goes by, and there are several, both guido and dante turn to look but without missing a beat of their solemn conversation. as they progress into and through the open plan office, many of the crew look up and cluster around, trying to get guido's attention, swelling the procession, interjecting with their urgent requests. there are set models everywhere, in the process of being constructed, or painted. jaconelli, guido's production designer, looks up from a model, hurries over. nobody stops moving. as a pretty girl passes between them, they all turn to look. pierpaolo, guido's young pa, has caught up with the procession. he has dozens of phone messages, sorting through them, as he walks alongside guido, through a partitioned office }
<C>__{pierpaolo}
<D>__{where do you want your messages?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{on my desk.}
<C>__{pierpaolo}
<D>__{there's no room on your desk.}
<A>__{ into the main office }
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{under my desk. in the trash. non lo so.}
<C>__{pierpaolo}
<P>__{(waving them at him)}
<D>__{some of these are urgent!}
<C>__{guido}
<P>__{(to pierpaolo)}
<D>__{get me a cigarette.}
<C>__{jaconelli}
<P>__{(confidentially)}
<D>__{we will never be ready to shoot in ten days.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{jaconelli }
<C>__{fausto}
<P>__{(at the same time)}
<D>__{not ready?!}
<C>__{guido}
<P>__{(continues)}
<D>__{ascolta me.}
<C>__{guido }
<P>__{(he kisses jaconelli on the cheek)}
<D>__{careful what you say. he's a spy from the bank.}
<A>__{guido carries on moving through the office.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{he's not exactly from the bank, guido.}
<A>__{now benito, guido's casting director, moves towards guido, guido tries to duck away from him as they head towards guido's office.}
<C>__{benito}
<D>__{dottore, dottore. you have actors waiting for you in your office. auditions all morning. you should see what i've found. i found two sisters. look, they're right...}
<A>__{guido turns through another partition, as they all besiege him with questions. benito despairs.}
<C>__{benito }
<D>__{dottore, this way...}
<A>__{guido heads towards wardrobe, goes straight through the door, swinging it shut, leaving the chaos behind him. dante blocks benito.}
<C>__{benito }
<D>__{maestro!}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{not now. he's got the press conference.}
