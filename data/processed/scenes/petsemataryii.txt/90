<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{drew steadies his quivering fingers just enough to sink the key into the deadbolt on the back door. drawing the creaking door open, he gazes out back.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(scared shitless)}
<D>__{gus?}
<A>__{nothing moves outside. the longer drew watches, the more eerie each shadow becomes. spooked, drew steps back inside, quickly closing the door. he locks it back up again. when he turns around, he's face to face with gus. drew stiffens, backing into the wall.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{h how'd you get in?}
<A>__{gus offers a nightmarish grin and raises his hand, dangling his keys.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{found 'em.}
<A>__{drew's eyes follow a flow of blood from gus' neck to the floor. gus looks down at his dirty, bloody footprints. he's tracked blood all over the linoleum.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i'm makin' a mess of your mother's kitchen floor...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i need a shower...}
<A>__{gus turns without another word and heads for the stairs. drew's mouth drops in utter astonishment as he watches gus clumsily climbing the stairs. after a moment, he returns his attention to the bloody kitchen floor. tearing off a wad of paper towels, he wets them and begins to mop up gus' tracks.}
