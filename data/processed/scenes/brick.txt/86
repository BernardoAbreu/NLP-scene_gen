<B>__{small dark room}
<A>__{brendan wakes up curled on a mattress on the floor. a bare light bulb hangs from the ceiling. tugger sits five feet away, watching him like a hungry dog. brendan stares back at him through thick, glazed eyes.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{where are my glasses?}
<P>__{(tugger grins)}
<D>__{hell with ya then. which wall's the door in?}
<A>__{tug points, amused. brendan heaves himself up, and tug shoves him back down. brendan winks at him, stands and lurches towards the door again. tugger grabs his shirt and slams him into the wall, but freezes when he hears a door latch click. sneering, he drops brendan back onto the mattress and sits against the opposite wall. sounds of a door opening and closing come from the darkness. light footsteps clack on the cement floor. suddenly tug vanishes the room's darkness just seems to swallow him. the thin whispery voice of the pin speaks softly.}
<C>__{pin}
<D>__{sorry about this kid, but what the hell with what you said before.}
<A>__{his disembodied face appears a few feet about where tug had sat.}
<C>__{pin }
<D>__{where you were at, with all of us and the tug a fist away, you've got to use your nut. allay the situation, so yeah, you're not scared of me, i got it, but i'm also thinking you're a little nuts now, so you've got that trade off with your standing. but nuts isn't all bad, so maybe it was a good play. i don't know.}
<A>__{he is standing in front of tug. his black clothes and broad rimmed black hat blend perfectly with the dark room, such that his face seems to bob about in space. brendan stifles a cough.}
<C>__{pin }
<D>__{so, laura talked me down. let's get you upstairs, back with the living.}
