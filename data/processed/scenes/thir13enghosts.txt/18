<L>__{interior hallway moments later}
<A>__{arthur comes out of the bathroom and beholds, in the kitchenette of his small, cramped three bedroom apartment... a blur of activity: kathy cooks at the stove, his son bobby, 7, eats a bowl of cereal at the kitchen table, while scanning the obituary section of the newspaper. he records the different, humorous deaths with a microphone and a tape recorder. in the b.g., on the television, a black and white horror movie drones on (the original thirteen ghosts). the nanny, maggie, 26, just gets in the way... wiping the counter, pouring the oj, setting the table. it's a very disorganized way of doing things. she's trying, sort of, but we can see from kathy's body language that she's at her wits' end with the woman.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{today on 'death in manhattan this morning,' we notice a small leap in heart attacks in the city, cancer deaths are down. and we have a special treat for everyone a body was found this morning decapitulated, decapilated, de }
<A>__{maggie cracks up. kathy turns toward him, nonplussed.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{bobby. find a healthier hobby.}
<A>__{bobby shuts off the tape recorder, angry at the interruption.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{kathy, i'm broadcasting! arthur enters, chipper.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{'morning, everyone!}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{dad, they found a guy without a head in a dumpster behind dunkin' donuts.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{that's nice.}
<A>__{maggie ruffles bobby's hair. arthur pours himself a cup of coffee, sidles up to kathy.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(sotto voce)}
<D>__{kathy, why don't you let maggie make breakfast? that's why i hired her.}
<C>__{kathy}
<P>__{(also sotto)}
<D>__{have you tasted her cooking?}
<A>__{kathy makes a gagging response while scooping eggs onto the first of three places on the counter. he looks at the eggs burned in effigy but continues smiling.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{dad, will you tell kathy that keeping a record of deaths is healthy because it's in the interest of science?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{kathy, it's healthy.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{she's being a real slut about it.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{bobby, don't call your sister a slut.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{thank you, maggie.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{a term like 'bitch' would be more appropriate. 'slut' is a term reserved for those of loose sexual morals, something, to be perfectly frank, kathy could use a bit more of.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{ha. ha.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{well, it's true, girl. when's the last time you had a date?}
<A>__{arthur pretends to not be disturbed by the conversation around him, smiling and nodding.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{why are you smiling?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i'm pretending you're all perfectly normal. it's working pretty well, too...}
<A>__{arthur turns toward the table, and holding a plate of food and his coffee...}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{hey, edgar allan poe, you finish your homework? mr. petersen tells me you aren't }
<A>__{... trips on bobby's scooter. the hot coffee spills all over him. he falls back into the counter, knocking the pan of eggs to the floor.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{jesus christ, that's the third time i tripped on that thing, bobby. get it off the floor before it kills someone.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{kathy}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{if we had a bigger place we wouldn't have this problem }
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(overhearing her)}
<D>__{well, we don't have a bigger place, so let's just keep our stuff off the floor. alright?}
<A>__{arthur wipes off his pants, but it's just one big stain. suddenly, there's a buzz at the door. everyone goes silent... kathy looks to arthur, who checks his watch.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{shit... i forgot, the lawyer.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{what lawyer?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i thought our credit was all cleaned up?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{no, no. it's not that. arthur goes to the door, mopping his crotch.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{mr. kriticos?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{brad moss?}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(outstretches his hand)}
<D>__{ben, yes, how do you do?}
<A>__{arthur shakes his hand. ben can't help but notice the stain in arthur's trousers.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{fine. come in.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{now a good time?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{couldn't be better.}
