<A>__{same setup as before except that it is now late afternoon and late in the winter of the year. the outline "e" is hung with icicles which are melting, dripping despairingly between us and mr. bernstein, still seated at his desk still working.}
<T>__{dissolve:}
<A>__{same setup as before except that it is spring. instead of the sad sounds of dripping rain or dripping icicles, we hear the melancholy cry of a hurdy gurdy in the street below. it is spring and through the letter "e" we can see bernstein working at his desk. pigeons are gathering on the "e" and on the sill. bernstein looks up and sees them. he takes some crumbs from his little homemade lunch which is spread out on the desk before him, carries them to the windows and feeds the pigeons, looking moodily out on the prospect of spring on park row. the birds eat the crumbs the hurdy gurdy continues to play.}
