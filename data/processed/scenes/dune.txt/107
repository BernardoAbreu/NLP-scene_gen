<D>__{are you a fremen?}
<C>__{kynes}
<D>__{i am a servant of the his majesty the emperor. i have served his majesty on arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(inner voice)}
<D>__{he's hiding something.}
<C>__{duke leto}
<D>__{i understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, doctor.}
<C>__{kynes}
<D>__{they are fremen suits. i hope they fit well, my lord.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{"your gift is a blessing of the river."}
<A>__{kynes' fremen guards, hearing this are siezed with agitation. kynes quiets them, then studies paul.}
<C>__{kynes}
<P>__{(inner voice)}
<D>__{the mahdi will greet you with holy words and your gifts will be a blessing.}
<P>__{(spoken, nonchalantly)}
<D>__{most of the desert natives here are a superstitious lot. they mean no harm. with your permission, i will check the security of your suits.}

<C>__{kynes}
<D>__{basically...}
<C>__{gurney}
<P>__{(leaping forward to protect his duke)}
<D>__{sire!}
<C>__{duke leto}
<D>__{it's all right gurney.}
<A>__{gurney steps back.}
<C>__{gurney}
<D>__{yes, sire.}
<C>__{kynes}
<D>__{it's a high efficiency filter and heat exchange system. perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. the salt is separated. breathing and walking provide the pumping action. the reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.}
<A>__{the duke is now properly fitted. kynes places the noseplug into his nose.}
<C>__{kynes }
<D>__{with a fremen suit in good working order, one can sustain life for weeks, even in the deep desert.}

<C>__{duke leto}
<D>__{my thanks.}
<C>__{kynes}
<D>__{with your permission...}

<C>__{kynes}
<D>__{you've worn a stillsuit before?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{kynes}
<A>__{your suit is fitted desert fashion. who told you how to do that?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no one. it... seemed the proper way.}
<C>__{kynes}
<D>__{that it is.}
<P>__{(inner voice)}
<D>__{he shall know your ways as if born to them.}
<A>__{kyne's fremen guard are watching paul very closely now.}
<C>__{gurney}
<D>__{we're wasting time, sire.}
