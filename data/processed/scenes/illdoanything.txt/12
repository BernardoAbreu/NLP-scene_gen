<A>__{where we see the crying baby holding the walky talky in front of its mouth as it screams into the mouthpiece.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i am gonna get this part, beth.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i can't stand this anymore.}

<L>__{interior matt's apartment morning}
<A>__{it's an awful place... the start up apartment he's way too old for... but we don't yet see his humble quarters. rather:}
<B>__{a blurred image}
<A>__{then, the screen is cleared on one half so we see half of a contact lens holder in focus the other half blurred until matt gets his second contact in. matt's pov a tube of tooth bleach. close on the directions, then:}
<B>__{on matt}
<A>__{bleaching his teeth... finishing... smiling in the mirror... this is the bleached smile of fear true fear the awful state of having lost your way. the phone rings. matt clears his voice before answering.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{hello... hi, beth. i'm glad you finally returned my call. what are you so mad about?}
<P>__{(again, into phone)}
<D>__{you know, you're not the only one who can scream, i can scream, too.}
<A>__{matt was so suddenly, emotionally extended that the anger leaves him that quickly... just a strange atypical lightning bolt of rage toward life and women.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(again, into phone)}
<D>__{you know what? i'm being a sort of gutless wonder here. i'm yelling back at you because i'm embarrassed. i won't be able to take the kid when i said... why don't you listen for a second?}
<A>__{he rubs his head with both hands, including the one holding the phone. this allows us to hear his ex wife repeat the same sentence over and over again.}
<C>__{beth }
<P>__{(from phone)}
<D>__{...you're taking her... you're taking her... you're taking her...}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{beth, i know exactly how long it's been and i feel strange as hell not seeing her but this isn't a choice. i'm broke. it's the driest spell of my life. i'm not saying it's your problem, but it's no place for a six year old. what can i do? the only full time job i seem to have is not showing how scared i am. what? no, that's not something i said before.}
<P>__{(accepting compliment)}
<D>__{well, thanks.}
<A>__{beth turns angry again. matt finds, unfortunately, that he's got one more act of bravado left.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(again, into phone)}
<D>__{beth, hey... hey. never mind, i will do it.}
<A>__{he hangs up.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(again, to himself)}
<D>__{i must get work. i will take anything. i must get work. i must not be embarrassed by these pep talks to myself...}
