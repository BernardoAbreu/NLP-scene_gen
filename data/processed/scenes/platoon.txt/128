<A>__{barnes stands there, silhouetted in the trap door, looking down at the men who are stunned to see him here. he steps down into the hutch, his face now lit by candle light. a bottle of whiskey in his hand, drunk, ugly, sweating, but as always, with dignity, possessive of his silence. he feels their fear in the silence, enjoys it.}
<C>__{barnes}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{talking 'bout killing?}
<A>__{he totters slightly as he circles the outer edge of the hutch. no one talks.}
<C>__{barnes }
<D>__{y'all experts? y'all know about killing?}
<A>__{he takes the bowl from adams, smokes it.}
<C>__{barnes }
<D>__{you pussies gotta smoke this shit so's you can hide from reality? ...}
<P>__{(smokes again)}

<A>__{confronting chris, he moves on, taunting them all.}
<C>__{barnes }
<D>__{there's the way it oughta be and there's the way it is. 'lias he was full of shit, 'lias was a crusader i got no fight with a man does what he's told but when he don't, the machine breaks down, and when the machine breaks down, we break down ... and i ain't gonna allow that. from none of you. not one ...}
<A>__{walks past rhah, past king, throws the pot bowl into the dirt of the floor.}
<C>__{barnes }
<D>__{y'all loved elias, want to kick ass, i'se here all by my lonesome, nobody gonna know. five you boys 'gainst me?}
<P>__{(pause, very soft)}
<D>__{kill me.}
<A>__{almost an appeal naked, intense. rhah, francis, doc look away. king, the biggest one there, is about to say something, but the moment passes. chris waits, his anger on the rise. barnes takes a swigger from the whiskey, then turns away contemptuously.}
<C>__{barnes }
<D>__{i shit on all o' you.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{kill you motherfucker!!!}
<A>__{chris slams into barnes, rushing him off his feet. pounding his face, solid blows.}
<C>__{king and others}
<D>__{get that mother, babe, go ... kick his ass, kill that cocksucker!!!}
<A>__{but barnes is too quick and very strong and takes the blows, getting outside chris' arm, twisting and flipping him in a wrestler's grip throwing him hard onto his back on the dirt floor. the expression of the men watching slumps, their hopes dashed. barnes springs around on chris, straddles him, one hand pushing his face back, hits him hard. once. twice. chris grimaces, groans, helpless now. a flick of sound. a knife whipped out of barnes' boot and pressing against chris' throat. chris bleeding from the nose and mouth. rhah suddenly spinning into action, fast now, realizing what barnes intends to do.}
<C>__{rhah}
<D>__{easy barnes, easy man!!!}
<A>__{barnes is on the verge about to kill again. chris waiting. rhah coaxing him, moving closer.}
<C>__{rhah }
<D>__{you'll do dinky dau in long binh barnes. ten years kill an enlisted. ten years, barnes, just climb the walls. don't do it ...}
<A>__{barnes' eyes tremble in the candle light, his scars ugly, a spasm clenching and locking his facial muscles. then suddenly he is calm again, very calm. we sense a man of enormous self control. suddenly he flicks his knife across chris, leaving a mark below his left eye. chris gasps. looking up at barnes rising off him. the boots alongside his face. the men looking on, the tension lowering.}
<C>__{barnes}
<P>__{(contemptuous)}
<D>__{death? what do you guys know about it?}
<A>__{he walks out. quietly.}
