<D>__{i left work after puking in front of little kids. and...now i'm drinking in the middle of the day.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well, those things happen sometimes.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i mean, they shouldn't happen all the time, but...it's the price of, uh, truly living life.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{isn't that like a slogan for some kind of beer or toothpaste or something...?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no. and it's true you and me, we're not just some boring couple in the suburbs who don't sleep with each other and have nothing to talk about except whatever tv show they're currently into.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we, like...still know how to party.}

<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i don't know i just get stupid when i'm drunk, and i'm drunk a lot.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we just like to have a good time.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{yeah, well...}
<P>__{(beat)}

<C>__{kate}
<D>__{well, last night i kinda, um...}
<P>__{(hushed)}
<D>__{...smoked some crack.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{some bar patrons glance at kate and charlie.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{after i left the bar, i, uh, picked up this drunk girl and...i don't really remember what came next, but i ended up smoking crack with her.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{uh...how's that even happen?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you give someone a ride and she rewards you with crack?!}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{well...she seemed desperate. she really needed a ride home.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{downtown. i think she maybe lives in...a tent?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{well...she might be homeless. or a prostitute. or just some lost sorority girl.}
<P>__{(thinks about it)}
<D>__{to be honest, i'm not sure...}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(disgusted)}
<D>__{oh, my god...you smoked crack with some random stranger? did you...share a pipe?}
<A>__{kate doesn't answer. she doesn't need to.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{ughhh...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{just playing devil's advocate, but maybe it's the crack smoking you need help with and not the drinking.}
<A>__{kate gives charlie a dirty look.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{i'm just saying.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{the drinking led to the crack smoking. the drinking leads to everything stupid i do.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i mean...can you even remember the last time we had sober sex?}
<A>__{charlie begins to answer, but then...goes blank. he tries to remember. and can't.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we'll chill out with the booze for a while. we can just be wine with dinner people.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{how's that sound?}
