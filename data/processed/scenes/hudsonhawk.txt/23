<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{right into a laz y boy chair hawk continues his "fall" into a ridiculously huge reclining chair. the foot stand swooshes out with a thump. a hand pulls away the canvas bag with a cackle.}
<L>__{interior gates apartment late night}
<A>__{hawk's weirdly reclining viewpoint makes gates and his pad more grotesque than they are (no small feat.) a sub radio shack stereo coughs next to a scary punch bowl of red, margarita like substance, beneath the instantly recognizable framed picture of those dogs playing poker, all atop a jungle shag. gates, in shorts and a hawaiian shirt over a keep on truckin' t shirt, raises a loud tumbler with one hand, the black canvas bag in the other.}
<C>__{gates}
<D>__{hudson hawkins gets the chair of honor. how about a gates arita?}
<P>__{(toward bowl)}
<D>__{i used real hot dogs.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{weren't you the bartender at jonestown?}
<A>__{suddenly a light is turned on in the corner, revealing a seated cesar and antony mario, the latter taking a painful gatesirita sip.}
<C>__{cesar}
<D>__{good job, not pretty, but good.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{ah, the mafia, the cops; do i know how to party or what?}
<A>__{gates pulls out the horse and looks at it.}
<C>__{gates}
<D>__{all this trouble for a horsey. i may not know art, but i know what i like.}
<C>__{hawk}
<P>__{(to dog picture)}
<D>__{you certainly do.}
<C>__{gates}
<D>__{so when's that sebastian cabot buckingham palace looking butlerhead getting here?}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{any minute now, dear mr. gates.}
<A>__{a malevolently snobbish british butler, alfred, enters in distaste. he makes a stressful glance to three vanity fairs on a coffeetable that has a photo of a magnetic husband wife dog combo with the caption: mayflower power. hawk notices this.}
<C>__{gates}
<D>__{oh, sorry jeeves. gates arita?}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{i will pass. may i?}
<A>__{alfred takes the equestrian model and with a jeweler's loupe, studies it carefully.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{ah, such craftsmanship. leonardo da vinci's last commission for the duke of milan. irreplaceable.}
<C>__{gates}
<D>__{hey, mr. french, i'm delirious for you. now where's my cut?}
<A>__{with dignity, alfred smashes the ancient horse over gates's head. alfred rummages through the debris revealing a perversely labyrinthine crystal piece. (recognizable from da vinci's workshop).}
<C>__{gates}
<D>__{you son of a......i don't believe this! you come into my house!}
<A>__{alfred pockets the goodies, but not before hawk can give them a confused peruse.}
<C>__{gates}
<D>__{i ought to take big ben and shove it up your limey blimey bunghole!}
<A>__{a blade slides down alfred's arm. half yawning, he... alfred's 180 degree pov spins before gates and the bystanders behind him. the blade goes back up alfred's arm. the room's only sound is the stereo's inappropriate music. gates shrugs but his voice is off.}
<C>__{gates}
<D>__{like i said. where's my cu u ...}
<A>__{suddenly a line across gates's neck turns red and blood begins to gush like a tourist attraction. gates crashes down upon the table holding the punch bowl and the stereo, sending it to the ground, cutting off the music. the dog poker picture falls atop the carnage like a lid. blown away, hawk tries to wiggle his way out of the recliner. alfred pats some stain remover on the blood on his shirt.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{so much for his "cut."}
<P>__{(post chortle)}
<D>__{excuse my dry british humor.}
<C>__{cesar}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{lovely work, alfred, taking the concorde back?}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{indeed i am, mr. mario. i'm really racking up those frequent flyer points...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{i hate to interrrupt you two lovebirds...}
<C>__{antony}
<D>__{you know, i think gates promised hawk a cut, too....}
<A>__{the mario brothers cackle out. hawk tries to flail out of his chair. alfred turns to him and flicks up his arm. hawk sees his life pass before his eyes until he realizes alfred is merely pulling him up off the chair.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{ta ta, hudson hawk.}
<C>__{hawk}
<P>__{(breathless)}
<D>__{too do loo, babe.}
