<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior return vehicle}
<A>__{standing over the open panel, an anxious sam 1 and sam 2 stare down.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{who goes first?}
<A>__{sam 1 wordlessly takes the lead, crouching slightly to seize the ladder and twist his body down into the hole. he begins to descend. when he is roughly half way down sam 2 follows.}
<L>__{interior lower deck chamber continuous}
<A>__{sam 1 reaches the bottom of the ladder. he's in a dark room, a kind of chamber if nasa did crypts, it would look like this. the only light source right now is the coming from the return vehicle up above. sam 2 hops down beside sam 1, squints into the darkness.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{is there a light?}
<A>__{both sams fumble along opposing walls sam 1 eventually finding a switch, snaps it on. an array of overhead fluorescent bulbs begin to stutter and flash before illuminating the chamber completely the two sams can hardly believe their eyes: stretching back maybe fifty feet are rows and rows of pods like upright glass coffins and standing inside each pod, an as of yet unawakened clone. it's like an entire army of sam bells... spooky as hell. for a few moments sam 1 and 2 are too stunned to speak. they walk to the end of the chamber and back again, looking at each clone one at a time all the clones are bare chested and wear some kind of white cloth to cover their genitals, like a diaper. of course they all look the same, that's why they're clones, but this piece of scientific wizardry is mind boggling to sam 1 and 2 they marvel at how each of the clones is identical in every way, and down to the minutest of details same length of hair, same skin tone, same fingernails }
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{why are there so many of them?}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{the cryo pod in the return vehicle is an incinerator.}
<A>__{sam 2 reacts with appropriate shock.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{we don't go home. we're burned to death up there. then the company wakes up a new one. every three years. like clock work.}
<A>__{sam 2 absorbing this. then:}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{how do you know all this?}
<C>__{sam 1}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i hacked into the old man. actually, gerty did. i saw footage. you're right, there have been other clones before us.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{how many?}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{enough.}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{if that rescue unit finds the two of us awake at the same time, they'll kill us both for sure.}
<A>__{sam 1 doesn't respond, he's in his own world.}
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{what are we going to do?}
<A>__{all of a sudden sam 1 makes a beeline for the ladder, starts heading back up.}
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{where are you going?}
