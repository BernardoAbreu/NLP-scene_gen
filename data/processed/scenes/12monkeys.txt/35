<A>__{stepping through the door, cole finds himself in an ante room facing several elevators. a uniformed security man sitting at a near by desk doesn't even lock up from the magazine he's reading. barely daring to breathe, cole steps toward the elevators so his back is to the security man. but he doesn't know how to control this elevator. what should he do?}
