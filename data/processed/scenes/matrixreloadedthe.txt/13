<L>__{interior main deck, neb}
<A>__{the crew grips the bulkhead and fixtures as the swaying ship comes to a rest. outside, the sounds of hover engines fade away. tank unlocks the main hatch, then jumps as it drops, unpowered, slamming into the tarmac with a resounding smash.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior zion tarmac}
<A>__{the tarmac is a busy, crowded military airport, with hovercraft of different sizes spread across the lot. its housed poorly lit, houses in a cave so huge the ceiling is out of site. crewpersons run around, servicing battle damaged vehicles. munitions are carted across the tarmac on robot rolling racks. no one pays the neb and its battered crew any mind. nearby, the sephora and freedom are parked. their engines shut down, and their powered hatches are open. the crewmembers are spilling out. niobe hurries to morpheus' side, and he steps toward her, smiling, but their military manner is quickly restored, though they can barely contain their grins.}

<D>__{niobe... she shakes his hand, the shake slows down.}
<C>__{m.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{thanks for the rescue.}
<A>__{they close for a kiss, when the freedom's captain suddenly jumps}
<D>__{between them. it's choi the neo's supposed neighbor and hacking financier. exhuberant and oblivious, he joyfully gets in morpheus' face.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{brough, you us your asses! we saved you so hard core you don't even know!}
<A>__{niobe smiles at morpheus and fades back as booth shouts his own}
<D>__{praises. morpheus turns to his less mature peer.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{so, you think you finally found the one, huh? another one?}
<A>__{dujour, choi's lieutenant, pushes into their conversation, looking}
<D>__{offscreen.}
<C>__{dujour}
<D>__{idiot, we helped him find him. hello, morpheus.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{huh? he looks at what she's seeing. his gaze halts on neo. he's}
<A>__{concentrating on tank and his apparent girlfriend, who seems to be consoling him. he turns to see choi and dujour, does a double take,}
<D>__{and his jaw drops open.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{you? choi is quick to resume his cool.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{in the flesh, so to speak.}
<C>__{dujour}
<D>__{welcome to the real world, neo. i'm glad you're here.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{what do you think, dujour? should we take him with us?}
<C>__{dujour}
<D>__{definitely.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{morpheus?}
<A>__{morpheus turns from niobe and a zion officer. he addresses trinity, glancing at the others.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{go on ship's liberty. meet me in the dead duck at 21:00 hours, drunk or sober.}
