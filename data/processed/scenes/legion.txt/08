<A>__{jeep hanson (late teens) bolts awake. breathing hard. covered with sweat.}
<L>__{interior jeep's room just before dawn}
<A>__{jeep switches on a lamp, illuminating this incredibly cramped bedroom. not much larger than the bed itself. he's got shaggy hair, a sensitive face, clearly not big on sunlight.}
<L>__{exterior desert pre dawn}
<A>__{a couple of ancient silverstream trailers are bathed in the eerie blue light of night's final moments. it looks like the trailers haven't moved from this patch of barren ground in decades. a single strand of colored christmas lights dot the trailers roof lines, marking the season. one of the trailer doors creaks open and jeep steps wearily out into the cool western morning. home. nothing but desert for miles in all directions, save for a two lane highway and a weather beaten truck stop diner that jeep and his father will open for business in a few hours. jeep gazes up to the diner's slanted roof where a large sign glows like a beacon in the darkness: "paradise falls gas `n' grub" a beat as jeep contemplates the sign.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{you okay, jeep?}
<A>__{jeep turns to see charlie, a very pregnant girl of about twenty, standing in the trailer doorway, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. even with the trailer trash veneer, she's strikingly beautiful.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{sorry to wake you, charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(stepping out of the}
<D>__{trailer, hands on her}
<P>__{belly)}
<D>__{wasn't you. he's been kickin' up a storm all night. must know somethin' i don't.}
<A>__{she approaches jeep. sees the strain in his eyes.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{another bad dream?}
<A>__{he struggles for a moment, nods.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's just stress, jeep, that's all. you do too much worryin'. about this place. about your dad.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{about me...}
<A>__{a glimmer of a smile crosses jeep's face.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{you're the only thing i like worrying about.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{see what i mean? you're worried about a girl eight months pregnant and it isn't even your baby. now that's enough to give anybody nightmares.}
<A>__{jeep turns away, dejected.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{go ahead, make fun of me. everybody else does.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(turns him back around)}
<D>__{c'mon, i was only kiddin'. you know how much i appreciate everything you and bob are doing for me, but a month from now, this baby'll have a new family and i will have to start thinkin' about what the hell i'm doin' with my life.}
<A>__{this is not news jeep wants to hear.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{so you're still going through with it...?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{jeep, i'm not ready to be a mama. christ, i can barely take care of myself as it is.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{i could help you. we could do it together, you know? i want to.}
<A>__{charlie smiles sadly at him, touched by his sweetness, but this just isn't where she's at.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you gotta stop carryin' the weight of the world on your shoulders.}
<A>__{jeep nods, tries to hide the fact that he's dying inside.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(rubbing her arms)}
<D>__{now can we go back in? i'm freezing my ass off out here.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{go on. i will be right there.}
<A>__{charlie kisses him on the cheek and heads back to the trailer. he watches her, longing in his eyes. with the clank of the door, she's gone. and over jeep's troubled look, the perennial holiday cheer of frank capra's "it's a wonderful life" mixes up.}
<C>__{jimmy stewart }
<D>__{i don't know whether i like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.}
