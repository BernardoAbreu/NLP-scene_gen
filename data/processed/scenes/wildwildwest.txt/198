<L>__{interior belly of the beast day}
<A>__{west plunges down into the metal chamber. oiled pistons, thrusting. steam, billowing. struggles to his feet. there, out of the shadows, steps...}
<B>__{knife guy}
<A>__{he's a mess... no hands, just brass collars where they used to be. they lock eyes.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{so, i guess you're the one who's gonna give me my whoopin'.}
<A>__{they square off. a beat. then, a long steely blade shoots out from where his left hand used to be.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{pfft. i got one a' those.}
<A>__{west reveals the less impressive four inch stiletto in his boot. knife guy responds by producing another blade from his other cuff.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{but you've got two of those.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{okay, lemme talk to gordon, i will see if he can...}
<A>__{no time for talk. knife guy does a bad ass series of moves. the blades criss crossing one another at blinding speed. west, unimpressed, retorts with a lame shake of his stiletto and boot. and the fight begins... knife guy attacks! west narrowly escapes each thrust of the knife, and attempts a kick to the groin... but comes up short the stiletto collides with one of the blades and snaps like a carrot. his only weapon... gone.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{damn.}
<A>__{west rolls onto the railing to avoid the attack. sparks fly as the knife guy tries to slice and dice west but misses each time, hitting the metal railing instead. west rolls to the floor, sucking air. knife guy lands a kick to west's ribs. and to make matters worse...}
<B>__{wrench guy}
<A>__{just showed up. he swings his wrench at west's head. west ducks but gets kicked in the back. he sails across the room, lands flat on his back. now...}
<B>__{shovel guy}
<A>__{makes an appearance. he hammers his shovel at west's groin, over and over. (west is in a crab position and backs up to avoid this.) west finally gets a kick in it does a moderate amount of damage. wrench guy appears and swings his huge wrench at west's head. west escapes it, barely... knife guy thrusts a side kick at west's chest, but west catches his foot, holds on for dear life. wrench guy is inbound, with wrench in hand. he swings on west, but west blocks it with knife guy's leg... ouch! west punches both of them. wrench guy tumbles out of}
<B>__{frame.}
<A>__{west stands. looking for a way out, but... no luck... shovel guy attacks. west ducks and the shovel connects squarely with knife guy's blades. west crouches and throws two simultaneous punches, each connecting with a set of jewels. west stands, follows it up with a right cross and left hook and these two jokers wind up out of frame. now... the wrench guy is on his feet and he's pissed! he attacks west, lands a solid kick to the chest and west flies backward toward a...}
<B>__{hanging chain}
<A>__{which he grabs. he scales the gears, gets a solid grip, then swings, a huge arc across the room, gaining momentum, and kicks shovel guy and wrench guy at the same time! off their feet they go, slamming onto the metal floor. west lands. knife guy attacks. west uses the chain to block the blades which are flying at him, left and right. sparks fly. west manages to wrap the chain around one of the knives, locks it down, and heaves it into the gears... the blade snaps.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{no more mister knife guy!}
<A>__{west drops a stiff right cross on the chin of the knife guy... wobbles his legs a bit. but before west can follow up...}
<B>__{another blade shoots out}
<A>__{to replace the broken one. it stops about a half an inch from west's nose. a struggle ensues, but west manages to wrap the chain around knife guy's neck and string him up. west throws a kick to his back... knife guy, hanging by his neck, flies through the belly... (the chain is on a track)... and out of the mouth of the beast, down into the abyss, chain and all. shovel guy springs to his feet and swings on west. west grabs the shovel and they struggle for possession... wrench guy comes out of nowhere and wants a piece of the action. but west uses the shovel to deflect the swing ing wrench... sparks fly. west gains sole possession of the shovel and mule kicks shovel guy out of frame. west spins just in time to land a crippling blow to wrench guy's back. shovel guy grabs the shovel. he and west tug o' war again. west ducks under the shovel and moves back to front with him. west elbows him in the ribs. he responds by putting west in a choke hold. west swings the shovel wildly but hits his target shovel guy's head! west steps back, gets his footing and, for good measure, whacks him in the back. wrench guy attacks. west defends himself with the shovel and lands a stiff kick to his stomach. wrench guy goes down... west turns, hits shovel guy in the chest with the shovel and he goes down... wrench guy sneaks up on west from behind and swings at his head. west, on instinct, lifts the shovel and blocks the deadly blow at the last second. west has now found his rhythm... he swings and shovel and connects with... first, the foot, then the chin, and last but not least, the head boink! west drops the shovel and, world wrestling federation style, picks him up and hurls him into the space between the gears. we won't see him anymore! west pivots and whack!... shovel guy plants a neat little roundhouse kick squarely on west's jaw. west backs up and catches another in the stomach. then... shovel guy really shows what he's made of... he does a series of jump kicks, round houses and fan kicks into the air. all perfectly timed, all deadly.}
<C>__{shovel guy}
<D>__{i learned that from a chinaman.}
<A>__{west, without missing a beat, steps on the shovel, which flips into his hand and whack! lands a clean one right on the top of shovel guy's melon.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{i just made that up.}
<A>__{shovel guy reels back and tumbles over the railing, through the hole and he's gone...}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{don't forget your shovel!}
<A>__{west casts the shovel out into the abyss.}

<P>__{(upward)}
<D>__{is that all you got for me, loveless?!}
<A>__{west, exhausted, turns and sees...}
<B>__{metal head}
<A>__{all seven feet of him. the top of his head is a metal plate. extending downward, encircling his eyes. west soaks him in, sighs.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{uh, i just threw my shovel out. so this really isn't fair. if you don't mind, i'd like to...}
<A>__{west, at lightning speed, throws a sucker punch spin ning back fist to metal head's jaw... ping! that one really hurt... west's hand, that is. metal head isn't fazed a bit. west throws another shot, this time to the gut... ping! then a kick to the groin... ping!!!}
<C>__{west}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{noooo.}
<A>__{metal head has had enough. he effortlessly picks west up by his lapels and flings him across the room. west tumbles, and lands right next to...}
<B>__{wrench}
<A>__{he picks it up and starts swinging! a shot to the body ... ping! then another... ping! then another... pingggg! metal head lurches forward, absorbing each blow with not so much as a twitch of the eye. west furries... ping! ping! ping! ping!... nothing! he goes for the head... pinnnnnngggg!... nothing! west is out of time. he's been backed up as far as he can go. his heels are dangling over the mouth of the beast, a thousand feet above the rocky cliff.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{metal head grunts, grimaces and pitches forward, toward west, slowly but menacingly... west braces himself.}
