<L>__{interior jergens' office day}
<A>__{apollo creed and his lawyer and trainer are seated in the offices of miles jergens. jergens, a successful promoter looks unhappy as he looks into the scowling face of apollo creed.}

<C>__{jergens}
<D>__{definitely }
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{ it says here, mac lee green has suffered a seriously cracked third metacarpal in his left hand.}
<C>__{apollo}
<D>__{damn.}
<C>__{jergens}
<D>__{i suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting green.}
<C>__{trainer}
<D>__{it ain't just green, what about the time apollo's invested }
<C>__{jergens}
<D>__{i believe we can find a solution.}
<C>__{apollo}
<D>__{solution, nothin' what about the bicentennial fight.}
<C>__{lawyer}
<D>__{jergens, don't play games with my client! apollo has already done nearly a million dollars worth of publicity }
<C>__{trainer}
<D>__{ten million's worth!}
<C>__{lawyer}
<D>__{ and has made contractual obligations with over twenty different organizations he doesn't want to be embarrassed.}
<C>__{apollo}
<D>__{you best find me another ranked contender an' i mean in a flash, man!}
<C>__{jergens}
<P>__{(holding up some notes)}
<D>__{i contacted ernie roman's manager, he's fighting in france the same week.}
<C>__{apollo}
<D>__{then gimme buddy shaw he's ranked fifth.}
<C>__{jergens}
<D>__{shaw's fighting in south america why not postpone the bout until july fourth?}

<D>__{hell with fourth of july, man! ten thousand things'll be goin' down on the fourth of july! apollo wants to be first!}
<C>__{jergens}
<D>__{that may not be possible, jimmy.}
<C>__{trainer}
<D>__{this man here is the star, dig don't cause him to breathe heavy now what 'bout that sucker, billy dukes?}
<C>__{jergens}
<D>__{went to california and gained fifty pounds and i called every worthwhile contender, but they say five weeks isn't enough time to get in shape.}
<A>__{apollo stands beneath a new fight poster and points to it.}
<C>__{apollo}
<D>__{shape, nothin' they're afraid. they know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!}
<C>__{jergens}
<D>__{apollo, i'm sure there's a way to salvage this.}
<C>__{trainer}
<D>__{nobody wants to be dissected on the country's birthday.}
<C>__{jergens}
<D>__{all i can counter with is that i'm a goddamn good promoter i've promoted in every country in the world and i've tried to the best of my abilities. perhaps you're right, and no one wants to be beat on the country's birthday... i don't know what else to say }
<C>__{apollo}
<D>__{i do maybe what this fight needs is something new a novelty.}
<C>__{trainer}
<D>__{you's the novelty, champ!}
<C>__{apollo}
<D>__{give my main man a raise!!}
<A>__{everyone laughs.}
<C>__{apollo}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{now here's what's goin' down. listen, 'cause i'm gonna say this but one time. on january first, the first day of the bicentennial i'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? a snow white underdog. an' i'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? an' i will tell you why, 'cause i'm sentimental an' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, apollo creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. now that's the way i see it an' that's the way i want it!!}
<C>__{jergens}
<D>__{... it's very american.}
