<L>__{interior mini mart night}
<A>__{the crime scene team is checking for prints, digging slugs out of the wall, photographing everything. several uniformed cops mill around. sykes moves aimlessly around the room like a stranger at a party. the proprietor's wife stands near the body in a strange rigid posture, a thin, mournful keening sound coming from her lips. a harried female uniformed cop is trying to get her away from the body, but can't get her to budge. minkler, a ballistics guy, is tagging the pump shotgun the raincoat alien dropped here. natuzzi, a mean looking veteran uniform cop is with him.}
<C>__{natuzzi}
<D>__{looks like a standard combat pump action.}
<C>__{minkler}
<D>__{it is.}
<C>__{natuzzi}
<D>__{so what punched holes clear through that car out there?}
<A>__{minkler pulls an evidence baggie from his work box. inside are four unfired twelve gauge shells.}
<C>__{minkler}
<D>__{bri sabot slugs. these puppies are nasty. two plastic sabots fall away in flight leaving a fifty caliber slug going two thousand feet per second. tug might as well've been hiding behind a rosebush.}
<A>__{minkler senses somebody has just stepped up beside him. he looks. it's sykes.}
<C>__{natuzzi}
<D>__{pretty heavy artillery for knocking over a liquor store.}
<A>__{a new voice enters the conversation.}
<C>__{jetson }
<D>__{an identical round was used in the shooting of a newcomer named hubley, two days ago.}
<A>__{sykes turns surprised, and not especially pleased to see the voice is jetson's.}
<C>__{minkler}
<D>__{yeah? so why the extra fire power?}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{perhaps because even the larger caliber handguns aren't always effective against my people.}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(mulls this, then)}
<D>__{you saying there's some connection to this other homicide?}
<A>__{before jetson can say, the female cop who was talking to the proprietor's wife steps up.}
<C>__{female cop}
<D>__{hey, give me a hand with this woman, will ya jetson? we've got to get her to division for her statement and she won't budge.}
<C>__{jetson}
<P>__{(to sykes)}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{and he moves off with his partner. sykes calls after him, but jetson is already approaching the woman and doesn't turn.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{so, you think there's a connection, or what? hey!}
