<D>__{not used to visitors.}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{sit.}
<A>__{old tim points to a ragged, overstuffed easy chair next to the "kitchen" area a sink, dishes and utensils, a tiny icebox. luke sits in the chair, and old tim sits on the cot, facing him. silence. luke glances up at a photo atop the bureau.}
<B>__{on the photo}
<A>__{it's a much younger old tim, looking quite serious and handsome in his great war doughboy's uniform. the cat jumps down from old tim's arms and moves to luke. he rubs against his legs, purring. luke leans down to pet him.}

<A>__{old tim puffs on his pipe, strangely detached.}
<C>__{old tim}
<D>__{t t thank you. thank you. i... i always... i always wanted to wear my uniform from the great war, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u u uniform, that's an army uniform and the bijou, she's not the army. they give me a medal, but i lost it in the h h hospital. i forget things sometimes. since the w w war.}
