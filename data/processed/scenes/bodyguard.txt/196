<L>__{interior backstage area night}
<A>__{frank moves down the hall from the green room toward the stage. stagehands, technicians, performers speak in hushed tones. tv monitors are mounted throughout the area. on screen a distinguished looking actor named reardon is serving as temporary master of ceremonies. frank walks along, checking the route, looking up into the flies. he rounds a corner and is face to face with portman.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{portman. what are you doing here?}
<C>__{portman}
<D>__{i'm on the job.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{portman}
<D>__{him.}
<A>__{portman points at a nearby tv monitor. on screen, reardon is introducing the next song.}
<C>__{reardon }
<P>__{(on tv screen)}
<D>__{my mother has always thought i was the star of every movie i've been in. you remember 'night of the stranger'?}
<A>__{applause.}
<C>__{reardon }
<D>__{you probably don't remember me in that. my mother can tell you about it. to this day, she thinks it's about a desk clerk at the hotel where what's his name is hiding out from the cops.}
<A>__{laughter.}
<C>__{reardon }
<D>__{now it's time to hear the final nominated song, from the film 'queen of the night' 'i have nothing.' and here to sing it for us, the multi talented miss sandra castle!}
<C>__{portman }
<P>__{(during the above)}
<D>__{short term gig... but quite profitable... listen, frank, i'm sorry about miami. you know, nothing really happened... i felt bad for you... i wanted to say something, but you disappeared...}
<A>__{(note: "i have nothing" fanfare. dancers onto stage. first section of song, commencing with shortened chorus then first verse (total 1 minute) reardon walks off the stage ten feet from where frank and portman are standing, glances at them and moves off down the hall.}
<C>__{portman}
<D>__{back to work. i will probably see you at the governor's ball.}
<A>__{portman walks off after reardon. frank watches him, thoughtful. on tv monitor sandra castle sings "i have nothing" with great feeling. the lyrics recall the text of the death threat. frank's face suddenly wary. no rational cause. something in the air. the clock 7:58}
