<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{but outside, it's living human tissue. flesh, skin, hair...blood. grown for the cyborgs.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{look, reese, i know you want to help, but...}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(cutting her off)}
<D>__{pay attention. the 600 series had rubber skin. we spotted them easy. but these are new. they look human. sweat, bad breath, everything. very hard to spot. i had to wait 'til he moved on you before i could zero him.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{hey, i'm not stupid, y'know. they can't build anything like that yet.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{no. not yet. not for about forty years.}
<A>__{reese is driving sedately for a low profile, but his eyes rove constantly, searching for a place to ditch the car. sarah's eyes are alert as well, and her tone becomes a bit too cool.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{so, it's from the future, is that right?}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{one possible future. four your point of view. i don't know the tech stuff.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{and you're from the future too?}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{they come to a red light and reese stops.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(patronizingly)}
<D>__{right...}
<A>__{like a shot she unlatches the seatbelt, pulls the door lock and has the door half open before reese can react. he catches her arm and hauls her struggling back into the car. sarah sinks her teeth into his hand with all her strength. his grip doesn't slacken. slowly, without releasing her, he reaches across with his other hand and shuts the door. his face shows no reaction. sarah draws back and stares at the blood running down his arm from the bite, that at his grim, scarred face. the light turns green and reese drives on. sarah tastes blood and wipes her mouth.}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{cyborgs don't feel pain. i do. don't...do that...again.}
<A>__{he wipes his hand on his pants.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(weakly, plead ing)}
<D>__{just let me go.}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(slow, but intense)}
<D>__{listen. understand. that terminator is out there. it can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. ever. until you are dead.}
<A>__{sarah slump in utter resignation.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{can you stop it?}
<A>__{reese doesn't look at her.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{maybe. with these weapons... i don't know.}
