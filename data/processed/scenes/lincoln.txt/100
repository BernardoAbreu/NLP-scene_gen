<D>__{"congress shall have power to enforce this amendment by appropriate legislation."}
<A>__{thaddeus stevens grins, nods, thinking, eyes sparkling.}
<L>__{interior exterior the dock at fortress monroe, hampton roads,}
<A>__{virginia late afternoon sailors cheer lincoln's arrival. lincoln walks across the gangway. seward greets him amidst the cheers.}
<L>__{interior the saloon on board the river queen, hampton roads,}
<A>__{virginia day lincoln, seward and the commissioners are seated. seward looks concerned at lincoln's fatigue.}
<C>__{alexander stephens}
<D>__{let me be blunt. will the southern states resume their former position in the union speedily enough to enable us to block ratification of the thirteenth amendment?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i'd like peace immediately.}
<C>__{alexander stephens}
<D>__{yes, and...?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i'd like your states restored to their practical relations to the union immediately.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{alexander stephens}
<D>__{if this could be given me in writing, as vice president of the confederacy, i'd bring that document with celerity to jefferson davis.}
<C>__{seward}
<D>__{surrender and we can discuss reconstruction.}
<C>__{alexander stephens}
<D>__{surrender won't be thought of unless you've assured us, in writing, that we'll be readmitted in time to block this amendment.}
<C>__{r.m.t. hunter}
<D>__{this is the arrogant demand of a conqueror for a humiliating, abject }
<C>__{seward}
<D>__{you'll not be conquered people, mr. hunter. you will be citizens, returned to the laws and the guarantees of rights of the constitution.}
<C>__{alexander stephens}
<D>__{which now extinguishes slavery. and with it our economy. all our laws will be determined by a congress of vengeful yankees, all our rights'll be subject to a supreme court benched by black republican radicals. all our traditions will be obliterated. we won't know ourselves anymore.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<P>__{(a nod, then:)}
<D>__{we ain't here to discuss reconstruction, we have no legal basis for that discussion. but i don't want to deal falsely. the northern states'll ratify, most of `em. as i figure, it remains for two of the southern states to do the same, even after all are readmitted. and i been working on that.}
<C>__{alexander stephens}
<D>__{tennessee and louisiana.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{arkansas too, most likely. it'll be ratified. slavery, sir, it's done.}
<A>__{hunter storms out of the cabin.}
<C>__{lincoln }
<D>__{if we submit ourselves to law, alex, even submit to losing freedoms the freedom to oppress, for instance we may discover other freedoms previously unknown to us. had you kept faith with democratic process, as frustrating as that can be }
<C>__{john a. campbell}
<D>__{come sir, spare us at least these pieties. did you defeat us with ballots?}
<C>__{alexander stephens}
<D>__{how've you held your union together? through democracy? how many hundreds of thousands have died during your administration? your union, sir, is bonded in cannonfire and death.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{it may be you're right. but say all we done is show the world that democracy isn't chaos, that there is a great invisible strength in a people's union? say we've shown that a people can endure awful sacrifice and yet cohere? mightn't that save at least the idea of democracy, to aspire to? eventually, to become worthy of? at all rates, whatever may be proven by blood and sacrifice must've been proved by now. shall we stop this bleeding?}
