<L>__{exterior lenny's house day}
<A>__{evan, exhausted, finally pulls into lenny's driveway. very little has changed in the past seven years.}
<L>__{interior lenny's room continuous}
<B>__{angle on lenny}
<A>__{now 20, making a model airplane. he's still overweight and looks like his mother dresses him.}
<B>__{pull back to reveal}
<A>__{the room is filled with model airplanes. hundreds of them. a knock on lenny's bedroom door. mrs. kagan, grayer, fatter, opens the door and escorts evan inside. she glares at evan while pretending to be cheerful.}
<C>__{mrs. kagan}
<D>__{i've got a surprise for you, lenny. you'll never guess who's here.}
<A>__{lenny looks up to see evan, his jaw drops.}
<B>__{angle on evan}
<A>__{looking around, shocked to see:}
<B>__{pan all the way around the room.}
<A>__{nothing has changed in the past seven years. the same kids' toys, posters and comic books.}
<B>__{as we pan all the way around to lenny}
<A>__{we see he's working on the model again, in his own world. the window of opportunity for conversation has closed.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{hey, uh, it's me. evan.}
<A>__{silence. lenny frowns.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{what's that you're working on? a model?}
<A>__{nothing.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{well, you look busy, so maybe i should make this quick. i'd totally understand if you didn't want to get into this right now, but that day at the junkyard, could you help me remember what happened? any details?}
<A>__{no response. evan picks up a model airplane from the desk.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i couldn't cut the rope.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(containing excitement)}
<D>__{yeah, good, what else do you remember?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{drop it or i will slit your mother's throat in her sleep.}
<A>__{evan, startled, drops the model on the desk. an epiphany.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{jesus christ. it really happened.}
<A>__{lenny stares out the window.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{what if i can get back all my lost memories with my journals.}
<A>__{with lightning speed, lenny jumps from his desk and unexpectedly shoves evan in to the wall. squadrons of hanging planes crash to the floor. lenny digs his fingers into evan's shoulder.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{make one peep and i swear it'll be your last, motherfucker.}
<A>__{evan is terrified. then lenny suddenly moves back and begins working on the model again, his eyes a million miles away. evan is speechless. the door bursts open. mrs. kagan looks at the smashed model airplanes by evan's feet. evan ignores her accusing stare.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{well, thanks for seeing me, man. i shouldn't have waited so long.}
<A>__{when lenny doesn't respond, mrs. kagan hustles evan back into the hallway.}
