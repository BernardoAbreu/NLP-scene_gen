<A>__{weir opens his eyes, waking from dream. sweat beads his ascetic, etched face. many years a scientist. he turns on the bedside lamp, revealing a couple's apartment. decorated by a woman, but weir is alone, unless you count photographs. his nightstand looks like a shrine to a beautiful woman. weir reaches to the stand. picks up... recent, unframed photo the woman appears thin and haggard and wears a small brave smile. weir lies back on the bed. looks at the photo. presses it to his forehead and closes his eyes. trying to be with her, just one more time.}
