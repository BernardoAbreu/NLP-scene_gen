<L>__{interior larch's office night}
<A>__{homer looks at his fake diplomas; they are now framed and hanging on the office wall. homer surveys the office, as if for the first time; he sits down in the desk chair, as if slowly getting used to his new position.}
<L>__{interior boys' division night}
<A>__{homer reads to the boys from "david copperfield". while his voice is strong positive, optimistic, certainly reassuring to the boys there is in the conclusion of the chapter something that distracts him. he seems to hesitate; he misses a line or two, and perhaps he purposely skips one or two others. (possibly homer's eyes wander ahead, to the title of the next chapter: "i make another beginning.")}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{"thus i began my new life, in a new name, and with everything new about me... i felt... like one in a dream... the remembrance of that life is fraught with so much... want of hope... whether it lasted for a year, or more, or less, i do not know. i only know that it was, and ceased to be; and... there i leave it."}
<A>__{homer stops and looks at the boys' faces.}
<C>__{curly}
<D>__{what happens next?}
<A>__{homer smiles.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{that's tomorrow, curly. let's mot give the story away.}
<A>__{homer puts out the lights and leaves the boys in the familiar semi darkness. seconds, later, the closed door to the hall is flung open, flooding the room with light from the hall, and homer, dressed in his long white laboratory coat and looking every inch the doctor, delivers his best imitation of larch's popular blessing.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{good night, you princes of maine! you kings of new england!}
<A>__{on copperfield and steerforth and curly as the door to the hall is closed and semi darkness prevails in the room again. copperfield, smiling, shuts his eyes. after a second, the wide eyed steerforth shuts his eyes, too. then curly. the last to close his eyes is buster.}
