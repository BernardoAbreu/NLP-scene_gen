<B>__{a massive space battle}
<A>__{involving dozens of starfleet and borg vessels, engaged in a fierce firefight as far as the eye can see. ships turning, twisting, firing, exploding. lots of movement. it's a spectacular sight. the borg sphere is moving away from the battle, heading off in another direction.}
