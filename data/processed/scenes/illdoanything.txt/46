<C>__{matt}
<D>__{there's no way we can get the dress it's impossible.}
<A>__{jeannie's feet start kicking in front of her the person in that seat turning sharply around.}

<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{noooooo. let go of me. noooo. the yellow dress... let go... let go.}
<A>__{she breaks away from him. he moves after her.}
<B>__{camera moving}
<A>__{at breakneck speed, jeannie dashes through the plane with her father in pursuit... flashes of disapproving faces. the seat belt sign goes on. a flight attendant blocks his path.}
<C>__{flight attendant}
<D>__{you'll have to sit down.}
<A>__{jeannie takes advantage of matt's being stopped and moves into the toilet, locking the door behind her.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{jeannie, we have to sit down. please.}
<C>__{captain's voice}
<D>__{we'll be having some turbulence for the next twenty minutes or so. will the cabin attendants please take their seats?}
<C>__{flight attendant}
<D>__{sir.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(simply and utterly)}

<C>__{matt}
<D>__{jeannie, you okay?}
<C>__{flight attendant}
<D>__{go back to your seat. i will get her.}
<A>__{as matt makes his way back, the flight attendant uses a hidden latch to open the door. music building then calming, the worst is over. matt makes his way back to his seat, shell shocked. the attendant leans over him.}
<C>__{flight attendant}
<D>__{she wants to be alone. so we're upgrading her.}
<A>__{he just nods.}
<B>__{full shot}
<A>__{down the aisle jeannie lets an attendant lead her as she peers back at her dad.}
