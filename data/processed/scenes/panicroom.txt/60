<A>__{junior turns from the open doorway of the master bedroom and races back down the hall, toward the elevator. he reaches the door, peers through the window. he sees the bare feet of meg and sarah, dropping toward him. he grabs the door handle, pulls as hard as he can, but it stays locked, with the elevator moving beyond. he bangs on the button, hoping the elevator will stop. as meg and sarah drop fully into view, he stands there, eye to moving eye with her for a moment. but the elevator doesn't stop, it keeps going down.}
