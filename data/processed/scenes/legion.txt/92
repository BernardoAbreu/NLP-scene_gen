<A>__{gabriel flies into a wall in an attempt to crush michael. he fails that but succeeds in leaving a massive dent. gabriel runs flies for the opposite wall. this one doesn't hold and the two enemies crash through it into the bathroom. unbelievably michael is still holding on. gabriel is up. he thrusts himself back into the bathroom mirror. it shatters painfully behind michael. gabriel rages out of the bathroom and into the diner. michael continues to ride him like a wild bull. gabriel slams michael into a wall once more. it's a brutal struggle. gabriel spots his mace sticking out of the wall within arms reach. he grabs it, holding it futilely in front of him. from this angle he'd never be able to hit michael with it. gabriel's strength is giving way. michael is winning. gabriel lets out a tremendous roar and plunges one of the mace's long spikes into his own stomach. michael's eyes go wide with surprise, his grip loosens. gabriel has run them both through. gabriel rips the mace from his body and stumbles forward. blood pours from a huge hole in michael's chest. right through his heart. gabriel looks down at the hole in his own belly. not nearly as bad as michael's. apparently there's not a lot of blood left in this guy. michael falls to his knees. weakening. gabriel looms over michael. michael looks up at him, blood leaking from his mouth.}
