<L>__{interior night. thornfield the library.}
<A>__{jane enters. rochester is in front of a superb fire one foot bandaged and supported on a stool. pilot is at his feet and so is adele, gazing adoringly at him. rochester is looking through jane's portfolio of sketches and watercolours. jane feels utterly exposed as if her diary is being read. mrs fairfax timidly interrupts.}

<D>__{adele has brought me these; are they yours?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{yes sir.}

<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{where did you get your copies?}
<C>__{jane}

<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{that head i now see on your shoulders?}
