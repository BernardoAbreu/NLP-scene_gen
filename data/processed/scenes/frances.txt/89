<L>__{exterior house night}
<A>__{frances rushes out, followed by barnes and a few curious partygoers. she is very upset. tight. holding it in. barnes pleads with her, tries to stop her, but she leaps in the car and speeds off, spewing gravel over him. the partygoers salute her with their drinks.}
<L>__{exterior a cliffside cocktail lounge night}
<A>__{in the pale moonlight we see the dim outline of a poster tacked to the outside wall. the highway disappears down to the sea glittering dully in the distance. we hear the rising sound of an approaching car. its headlights crest the hill, illuminating the poster, showing a woman driving an open car, seated beside the outline of a familiar mustached figure. the poster reads, "when you're riding alone, you're riding with hitler." the lights grow brighter, almost blinding. the car, accelerating furiously, flashes by. then we hear a motorcycle start up. it emerges from the blackness and speeds off in pursuit. a roadsign reads: "dimout zone." frances drives fast, tears running her face. the motorcycle cop pulls up alongside and shouts, "pull over!" she hesitates. he waves insistently. gradually she slows. he gets off his bike and walks over, preparing the usual lecture.}

<P>__{(switching off her lights)}
<D>__{there's a war on, you know?}

<P>__{(testy)}
<D>__{i didn't make the law, lady. i just enforce it.}
<A>__{she switches her headlights back on.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{god, you bore me.}
<A>__{she starts the car. the cop, angry now, lunges in and grabs the keys.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{don't touch me!}
<A>__{she leaps out of the car. the cop turns off the car lights. as frances passes his motorcycle, she switches on its lights.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{he runs after her, turning off the motorcycle lights on the way. when he catches her, he grabs her arm. she struggles, grabs the flashlight from his belt. she switches it on and holds it high, its beam spearing wildly out to sea. he lunges for it, knocks her down. they struggle. he rolls on top of her, pinning both her arms with one hand... trying to handcuff her. she writhes, knees him in the balls. she crawls away, desperately clawing at loose stones. the cop, angry now, hurls her down again and manages to get the cuffs on. as they dig into her wrists, she tries to bite him. the cop, winded from the battle, yanks her to her feet and drags her, kicking and screaming, to his motorcycle. he pulls out his radio mike.}
