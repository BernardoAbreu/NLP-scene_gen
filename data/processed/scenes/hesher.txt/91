<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{boys please, i'm not feeling well.}
<A>__{grandma heads back to the kitchen to grab more food. there is silence at the table.}
<C>__{dad}
<P>__{(to hesher)}

<C>__{dad}
<D>__{i don't care. if i hear it again, you're going to your room.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{my room!? you gonna start punishing me now?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{maybe i need to. if it's not the language, then it's your lack of responsibility... or i'm having to escort you down to the police station.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{shit, dad. i'm really sorry you had your ass dragged off the couch. i'm sorry you had to put some fucking underpants on for the first time in months.}

<C>__{tj}
<D>__{oh, what, soon as i'm right, that's enough?!}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{tj! i don't want to hear one more word from you!}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{fine. fuck this.}
<A>__{tj sweeps his plate off the table. it goes crashing onto the kitchen floor, food everywhere. grandma walks back into the room, looking worried. hesher seems riveted, like he's watching the tennis. and then dad sweeps his plate off the table. crash, food, mess. he glares back at tj.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{that make you feel better?}
<A>__{tj wrenches his chair back and storms off. dad sits a moment. with tj gone, his reproach turns to shame. grandma and hesher make eye contact with each other. dad gets up and leaves the kitchen. hesher shovels some more food into his mouth. grandma looks concerned.}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{did i miss something?}
<C>__{hesher}
<P>__{(mouth full)}
<D>__{not really. paul came in and said some dumb shit which tj got angry about and so tj smashed his plate and then paul smashed his plate too but i got a feeling he smashed his one cuz he couldn't actually think of anything to say cuz he kinda knew tj had a point and so now he feels bad about it and so he's gone somewhere.}
<P>__{(takes another mouthful)}
<D>__{i don't know where.}
<A>__{grandma contemplates this.}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{those boys have been through a lot.}
<A>__{this makes grandma very sad.}
<C>__{grandma }
<D>__{sometimes i wonder if they're ever gonna smile again}
<A>__{tears well in grandma's eyes. grandma is quietly crying.}
<C>__{grandma }
<D>__{i just wish there was something more i could do.}
<A>__{a long beat passes. hesher doesn't know what to say. he pours applesauce on his food. grandma looks around the kitchen at the mess. she shakes her head, takes a deep breath and starts cleaning up. she picks up bits of broken plate and takes them to the sink. hesher watches her.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{this is delicious.}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{thank you, dear.}
<A>__{hesher holds up a piece of bacon covered in applesauce and licks off the sauce.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{what's green and slimy and smells like bacon?}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{i don't know, dear.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{what's green and slimy and smells like bacon?}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{a worm? i don't know. i'm going to lie down. i'm not feeling well. i'm very nauseated.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{oh, ok.}
<A>__{grandma exits. hesher finishes the last few bites of his dinner. he notices dad's pill bottle. he reaches for them. he unscrews the lid and empties a few into his hand. he swallows the pills.}
