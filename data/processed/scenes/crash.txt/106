<A>__{momentum has carried james past the point where catherine has left the road. james stands on the brakes until the lincoln shudders to a halt. he jams the shift lever into reverse and backs up, tires squealing and smoking in protest, to where he saw her go over the edge.}
<L>__{exterior utility road sunset}
<A>__{james jumps out of the car and stands for a beat at the edge of the road on the wet grass, savoring the tableau below him. catherine lies sprawled, half out of the car, her tight black dress hiked up over her hips, one arm across her face as though shielding her eyes from the sight of her ruined, lightly smoking sports car. james eagerly makes his way down the wet grass of the hill toward catherine. as he approaches her, she begins to move, stretching her arms behind her head, as though awakening from a deep sleep. he can now see that her dress is wet, soaked by the dirty water trickling out of the culvert and now dammed up by her torso. james kneels close to catherine.}

<D>__{catherine. are you all right? are you hurt?}
<A>__{catherine's eyes flutter open. her mascara is smeared, as though she has been crying, and there is wetness at the corners of her eyes. her upper lip is bruised and beginning to purple, and there is blood on her forehead and at the corner of her mouth.}

<D>__{james, i... i don't know... i think i'm all right...}
<A>__{james slips her panties down her legs, leaving them around her left ankle when they snag on the one high heeled shoe she still has on. he gently rotates her on to her right hip, undoes his fly, then lies down on the concrete with her, ignoring the light, muddy stream which now begins to soak the thigh of his trousers. kissing the back of her neck, he enters her from behind.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{maybe the next one, darling... maybe the next one...}
<A>__{we pull up and away from the couple on the ground until we lose them behind the overturned sports car, then rise and pivot until we are once again watching the frantic lanes of traffic hurtling by obliviously only a few meters away.}
