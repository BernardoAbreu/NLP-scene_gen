<L>__{interior sports bar night}
<A>__{most of the patrons are fixated on an orioles game blaring from a large flat screen tv. at a booth in back, dwayne and jay are in deep conversation.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i don't wanna stick my nose into a family matter...but killing your old man? that's pretty messed up...i mean, unless you think it isn't.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{what we have here is a classic "lesser of two evils" debate. you got one evil: me shaving a few years off the major's shitty life. then you got the other evil: the major ruining my entire awesome life by blowing through my inheritance. maybe i'm biased, but mine sure as shit seems like the lesser.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i guess i...sorta see where you're coming from. and you have been waiting around forever for that money. you deserve it, dwayne.}
<A>__{dwayne nods, seriously.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{you know, there's a reason i sleep 'til noon everyday. and it ain't 'cause i'm lazy. it's on account of me having so many goddamn dreams. big ones. and once that money's mine, they're all gonna come true.}
<A>__{dwayne takes a long sip of beer, contemplative.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{like i had this one dream last night. i was cruising through town in a lamborghini diablo. the wind was blowing through my hair, ruffling my open shirt. there was a hot little piece of ass sitting next to me. and in the back seat, jay...was you. strapped. wearing a pair of oakleys.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{wow. i didn't know you dreamt about me, dwayne.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{it was only this once, jay. to be honest, i didn't know what to make of it. so i consulted my dream book, and found out it means this: you're my road dog. you got my back.}
<C>__{dwayne }
<D>__{that's why i want to make you my partner.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{in what?}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{in crime. and business. you see, it ain't just about the inheritance money. it's about what i'm gonna do with it.}
<A>__{dwayne leans across the table.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i'm about to clue you in on something. and then you'll understand the true magnitude of what's at stake here. are you ready?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{yes. i'm totally ready.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{then answer me this...what's this town missing? i will give you a hinterior it's a cash business, crawling with sexy bitches.}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{a chinese food restaurant?}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{no. a tanning salon.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{think about it. all that green. all that brown flesh.}
<A>__{jay nods, thinking about. he smiles.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{it's also the perfect front for a prostitution ring.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{yeah, of course. because of the booths.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{yes. and because of the bitches.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it can all be ours. 30 percent for you, 70 percent for me. you just gotta help me out here.}
<A>__{jay looks conflicted. dwayne goes dark, like a spurned lover.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i'm starting to wonder if my dream book was wrong about you. maybe you sitting behind me doesn't mean you're my road dog. maybe it means you're plotting to stab me in the back, like some snake in the grass.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{that's crazy. i'd never do something like that. the dream book was right!}
<A>__{jay looks dwayne in the eyes, knows it's all or nothing...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{ok. i will do it. but i'm not shooting him or anything. i will hold him while you shoot him. that's it.}
<A>__{dwayne chuckles.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{here's a fact: they don't build prisons for criminals, they build them for idiots. shit, they got three different types of csi on tv, just laying out how the police do their business...and still, idiots like you think you can just go out and do a murder yourself.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{if you wanna be a millionaire, you gotta think like one. and millionaires don't kill people. they hire assassins. which i did. we gotta pay him on tuesday.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what? why would you do that?}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i was presented with an opportunity. i took it. 100 thousand bucks for a highly trained assassin is a steal.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{but we don't have that kinda money.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{now we're addressing the real problem: how do we get the 100 grand? 'cause once we get that, we get the million.}
<C>__{dwayne }
<D>__{and once we get the million, we will literally own this town and every single thing in it.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i guess we could just...rob a bank. one of these local banks with nothing but a dipshit security guard.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{again, not quite thinking like a millionaire.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{okay, then let's hire someone to rob a bank.}
<A>__{dwayne thinks about this for a second.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{fuck hiring them, we could just force someone to rob a bank for us. like with blackmail, or death threats, or }
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(almost involuntarily)}
<D>__{a bomb. everyone's scared of a bomb.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i was gonna say hypnotism...but i like that. it's out of the fucking box. we just strap one to some motherfucker's chest, like we did to those watermelons. think you can you build some kinda bomb vest?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{yeah, i mean...camel jockeys do it in caves. i got a garage workshop.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i'm pretty sure this is exactly how a millionaire would do it. and the beauty of it is: we don't lose any sleep, 'cause no one gets hurt.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{except the major.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{yeah. the major dies. but no one gets hurt.}
<A>__{dwayne smiles. but a nagging thought interrupts him }
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{there's just one problem. where do we get our guy? 'cause if we do a kidnapping, then we're right back where we started...doing shit that's gonna get us caught.}
<P>__{(mind working)}
<D>__{what we need is someone to come to us...to a place where we can control the situation. someone without any connection to us.}
<A>__{the guys stare at each other, stumped. until something catches dwayne's attention...a local commercial playing on the flat screen. a pizza chef slides a pizza into a box }
<C>__{pizza chef}
<P>__{(on tv)}
<D>__{we'll deliver anywhere in 30 minutes or less! or your pizza is free! giorgio's trattoria, where the customer gets what they want...pronto!}
<A>__{the guys look at each other.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{sometimes fate just takes out its cock and slaps you in the face with it.}
