<A>__{evelyn sits at a glass topped table. gittes joins her.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{my husband's at the office.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{actually he's not. and he's moved from his apartment at the el macando.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{that's not his apartment.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{anyway... i... the point is, mrs. mulwray. i'm not in business to be loved, but i am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. l.a.'s a small town, people talk.}
<A>__{he waits for a response. then:}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(continuing; uneasily)}
<D>__{i'm just trying to make a living, and i don't want to become a local joke.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{mr. gittes, you've talked me into it. i will drop the lawsuit.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i said i will drop it.}
<A>__{the iced tea comes on a tray which ramon sets down between them.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(continuing; pleasantly)}
<D>__{so let's just drop the whole thing. sugar? lemon?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{mrs. mulwray?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(as she's mixing one of the drinks)}
<D>__{yes, mr. gittes?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i don't want to drop it.}
<A>__{evelyn looks up. gittes smiles a little sheepishly.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i should talk this over with your husband.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(a little concerned)}
<D>__{why?... what on earth for? look, hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{well, i've been accused of many things, mrs. mulwray, but never that.}
<A>__{again he laughs a little nervously. again no reaction.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and i want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. i'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so i'd like to see your husband. unless that's a problem.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(with a slight edge)}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{may i speak frankly, mrs. mulwray?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{you may if you can, mr. gittes.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(determined to be polite)}
<D>__{well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course. she's disappeared. maybe they disappeared together somewhere.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(with rising anger)}
<D>__{suppose they did. how does it concern you?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{nothing personal, mrs. mulwray, i just }
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{it's very personal. it couldn't be more personal. is this a business or an obsession with you?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{look at it this way. now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. they were out to get your husband. now if i see him, i can help him. did you talk this morning?}
<A>__{evelyn brushes lightly at the horsehair on her jeans.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{no. i went riding rather early.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{looks like you went quite a distance.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{no, just riding bareback, that's all. anyway, you might try the oak pass or stone canyon reservoirs. sometimes at lunch hollis takes walks around them. otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i will stop by.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{please call first.}
<A>__{gittes nods.}
