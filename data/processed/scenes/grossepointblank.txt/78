<C>__{martin}
<D>__{how are you? how's business?}
<C>__{mr. newberry}
<D>__{martin, i don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and i don't care. it was good that you left, and i'm glad you did. so what do you want to talk about? you've grown up a bit. maybe i had you figured wrong.}

<D>__{how's that?}
<C>__{mr. newberry}
<D>__{i visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel wearing, coffeehouse misanthropes i've been seeing in newsweek.}
<C>__{martin}

<C>__{mr. newberry}
<D>__{oh, you know me, martin. i'm the same old sell out baby boomer, exploiting the oppressed i got shot for at kent state. but why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?}
