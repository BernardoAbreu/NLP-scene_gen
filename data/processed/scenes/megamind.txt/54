<A>__{hal enters, grabs a bottle of vodka from atop of the fridge and takes a long pull from it.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{a man will usually find that if he drinks from a bottle, eventually, the bottle drinks from him.}
<A>__{hal does a spit take. in the corner a darkened figure stands.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{who are you!?}
<C>__{voice}

<A>__{pat morita steps out from the shadows. hal passes out again.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{we are close on hal's face as his eyes flutter open. he appears to be lying on the couch. he hunches up on his elbows, looks around, but everything is as it seems. he lays his head back down.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{thank god. it was a dream. man, i must be losing it.}
<A>__{a voice sounds right next to his ear.}
<P>__{"pat morita" (o.s.)}
<D>__{you know you're out of orange juice?}
<A>__{hal leaps up to find he's been resting his head on pat's lap.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{jesus! this isn't happening, this isn't happening.}
<A>__{hal backs away and trips over a box.}
<D>__{"pat morita" calm. all things must be filtered through calmness.}

<C>__{hal}
<D>__{look i'm gonna call the cops in about two seconds if you don't get out of here.}
<A>__{pat rises and walks to hal. he's so calm it makes hal calm.}
<D>__{"pat morita" are you calm now?}

<C>__{hal}
<D>__{what the hell was that for? "pat morita" rule number one: expect the unexpected.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{can you just tell me what this is all about? "pat morita" the heavens are not in the habit of bestowing a gift such as this to just anyone. you are being rewarded for being a man of great moral fortitude with an unwavering belief in humanity.}
<C>__{hal}
