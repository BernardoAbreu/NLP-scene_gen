<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior carnival day}
<A>__{a loudspeaker playing percy sledge's "when a man loves a woman," as we see a carnival in the distance with a ferris wheel turning round and round. a black man is by a stall. on his arm is an irish girl with blond hair. the black man is drunk, and is tossing rings around a bowling pin.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{and that's cricket, hon.}
<A>__{an attendant hands him the teddy bear. it looks ridiculous in his huge hands. he gives it to the girl.}

<C>__{jody}
<D>__{don't run off, jude.}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{you don't know me, do you?}
<A>__{jody walks inside the canvas flap and vanishes from sight. we can still see his hand, holding jude's. she leans against the canvas, looking bored.}
<C>__{jody}
<P>__{(inside)}
<D>__{what if i did?}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{you'd know i wouldn't run off.}
<A>__{she stands there, listening to the sound of him urinate. her eyes flick around the carnival. they settle on a tall dark haired man in a dark jacket. he nods.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{never pissed holding a girl's hand, jude.}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{you didn't?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{and you know what?}

<D>__{i never know nothing.}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{people. they could be looking.}
<A>__{jody follows her, as she walks backward, drawing him on. he moves his hips to a song as jude leads him over the beach, under a train trestle.}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{come and get me, soldier }
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{whatever you say, jude...}
<A>__{he sinks down on his knees toward her. she wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him. jody writhes on top of her, fumbling with his belt. jude cocks one eye upward. a shadow falls across them. close on jody, kissing her. a gun is put to his head. he turns around, drunkenly.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{what the fuck }
<A>__{the gun whacks him across the cheek and he falls sideways. jude scrambles to her feet and darts like an animal through a field. jody feels his cheek. he can see her blond head vanishing among the fields. he looks up and sees a group of men around him. the tallest of them, fergus, cocks the gun.}
