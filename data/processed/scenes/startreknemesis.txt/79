<L>__{exterior enterprise space}
<A>__{the enterprise zooms through space. completely unaware of the predator directly above it.}
<L>__{interior enterprise astrometrics night}
<A>__{data is at work in astrometry. cartographic projections of star systems ebb and flow on a large screen before him. picard enters.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{show me our current position.}
<A>__{the images before them quickly change to show another sector and a blip representing the enterprise.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{how long until we reach the fleet?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{at our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.}
<A>__{the images before them change to show sector 3274. we see blips denoting starfleet ships moving into position. picard gazes at the projection of stars before them for a moment.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{"for now we see but through a glass darkly..." he said he's a mirror.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{of you?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{i do not agree. although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{but so much is the same. on a biological level he is... and i will not accept the idea that there is nothing i can do. i have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{he would deny a "human" connection is possible. he considers himself entirely reman.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{he may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{no, sir, it is not possible. the b 9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. but even if they were, he would not be me.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{how can you be sure?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{i aspire, sir. to be better than i am. the b 9 does not. nor does shinzon.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{we'll never know what shinzon might have been. had he stood where i did as a child? and looked up at the stars.}
<A>__{picard's words linger in the air for a moment. then the projections before them sputter with static for a moment. flickering.}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(working controls)}
<D>__{we are passing through the bassen rift. the projections will return when we have cleared it.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{it's interfering with our uplink from starfleet cartography?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{yes, sir. the rift effects all long range communications }
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(urgent, to comm)}
<D>__{commander riker, evasive maneuvers!}
<A>__{too late. the ship quakes a photon torpedo blast the enterprise is under attack!}
