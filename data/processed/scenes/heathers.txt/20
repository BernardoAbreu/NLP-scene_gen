<L>__{exterior the sawyer backyard late night}
<A>__{the viewer's viewpoint glides through the grass of veronica's backyard uncovering combinations of wickets and articles of clothing. a pair of girls shoes and a pair of guys shoes rest together by the first wicket.}
<C>__{j.d. }
<D>__{goddamn, no wonder you looked so mangled when i came through the window.}
<A>__{feminine socks and masculine socks lay crumpled by the next wicket.}
<C>__{veronica }
<D>__{i've always treated heather's teen queen power plays as bullshit.....}
<A>__{as veronica quiveringly pauses, a stylish blouse and a rugged shirt are revealed mingling by another wicket.}
<C>__{veronica }
<D>__{but i'm really scared. who am i going to eat lunch with on monday? i sound like an afterschool special.}
<A>__{the viewer's viewpoint moves to a dress and a pair of jeans resting side by side at another wicket.}
<C>__{j.d. }
<D>__{that was my first game of strip croquet, you know. i thank you.}
<C>__{veronica }
<D>__{you're welcome. it's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.}
<A>__{veronica's blue mallet has been staked into the ground. her panties hang on one end, j.d.'s underwear hangs on the other.}
<C>__{j.d. }
<D>__{well, i don't know. there's something to be said for...ouch!}
<A>__{veronica and j.d. are finally revealed, entangled in an artful pose upon j.d.'s gunslinger coat. they warmly kiss. veronica breaks off to uneasily giggle.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{what a night.}
<A>__{j.d. gently bites in to veronica's neck. veronica grooves on it, closing her eyes tightly.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{what a life. i almost moved into high school out of sixth grade because i was some genius. we all decided to chuck the idea because i'd have trouble making friends, blah blah blah.}
<A>__{veronica slides her head down against j.d.'s chest and gracefully rests on his lap. gently fighting slumber, she murmurs up to j.d., who showers her face with slow kisses.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{now blah blah blah is all i do. i use my grand i.q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. some genius.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{heather chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{killing her won't solve anything.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{a well timed lightning bolt through her window and monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{well then, i will pray for rain.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{see the condoms in the grass over there. we killed tonight, veronica. we murdered our baby.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{hey, it was good for me too, sparky.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{just saying it's not hard to end a life.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{there's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm.}
<A>__{they laugh. veronica maneuvers herself into a sitting position.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{i guess i don't know what the hell i'm talking about.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. let's just grow up, be adults, and die.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{good plan.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{but before that, i'd like to see heather chandler puke her guts out.}
