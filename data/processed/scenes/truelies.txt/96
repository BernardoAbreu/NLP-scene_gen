<L>__{interior scenic elevator night}
<A>__{harry canters the horse into the next elevator, which has just been boarded by an older couple. he has to practically lie down on the horse to fit through the door. the animal barely fits, nose to tail, in what turns out to be a glass elevator with a view of the whole atrium of the hotel as it rises, right to the top of the building. harry looks through the glass at the elevator car next to him, fifteen feet away. malik is inside, punching a button. he glances up and sees harry. there eyes meet for a moment, just before malik's car ascends rapidly. malik's malevolent glare is etched on harry's retinas. the older couple is jammed against the side wall by harry's panting, snorting horse. it clomps around the tight elevator. the woman is trying to crawl between her husband and the wall.}
