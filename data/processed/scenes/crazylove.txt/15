<A>__{letty lies in bed. the alarm clock blasts opera. letty fumbles for the switch. she can't turn it off. she yanks out the cord.}
<B>__{l}
<A>__{letty gets out of bed, walks to the dresser and turns off the second clock before it rings. she goes to the kitchen and snaps off the alarm, then heads down the hallway and shuts that alarm off, as well. letty hurries back to her bedroom and crawls into bed. paul, toweling his hair dry, walks in.}
<C>__{paul}

<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i don't feel like going to work today.}
