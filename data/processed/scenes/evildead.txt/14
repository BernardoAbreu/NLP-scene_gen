<A>__{shelly cooly drinks from the scotch and passes the bottle back to ashly and linda. ashly pours linda a drink in the bottle cap and keeps the bottle. they raise their drinks.}
<D>__{ashly and linda ...with good friends.}
<A>__{they toast, drink and react to the strong liquor. ashly tries to hide his reaction to the scotch in front of linda, since shelly had reacted so calmly. ashly passes the bottle to cheryl who stops him with a polite "no, thank you," then back up front to scott.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{hey scotty, what's this place like anyway?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{well, the guy that's renting it says it's an old place, little run down, but it's right up in the mountains totally secluded. (he takes a drink from the bottle) best part is, we get it so cheap.}

<D>__{why are we getting it so cheap?}
<C>__{scott}
