<L>__{interior tunnel "a" chamber day}
<A>__{hellboy and manning come into a vast chamber: slavic motifs crown the rugged stone pillars and archways. water runs down the walls. across a small stone bridge, light pours from a hexagonal structure. they step onto the bridge. klanggg!!! two gears release a steel door from above, forcing them to forge ahead. somewhere, a massive clockwork is ticking.}
<C>__{manning}
<D>__{what's that }
<A>__{hellboy motions for silence. the corpse mutters: "it's something big" they stare into the darkness.}
<C>__{manning}
<D>__{we should go back you you could tear that door apart }
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{don't move. we }
<C>__{manning}
<D>__{ should go back. now!}
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{no. don't }
<C>__{manning}
<D>__{i'm in charge. we go back!}
<A>__{hellboy yanks manning just in time. bammm!!!! a gigantic metal pendulum swings past and demolishes one third of the bridge a few feet from their feet. it takes lime and the corpse with it. another door on the far end of the bridge shudders downward.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{son of a }
<A>__{whoosh! the pendulum swings back. it destroys more of the bridge. manning sprints for all he's worth and crawls under the door. hellboy runs, but chunks of stone disintegrate under his feet. the pendulum swings back taking out the final piece of the bridge just as hellboy rolls under the door and makes it into the hexagonal building.}
