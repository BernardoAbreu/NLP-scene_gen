<L>__{interior juhu slum. day.}
<A>__{the lanes in between the corrugated iron shacks are three feet wide, with an open drain running down the middle. many of the precarious upper floors of the shacks have been built right over the paths, turning them into black tunnels. tunnels shot through with slivers of light. if you didn't live here, you would be lost and frightened in minutes. but these children are natives and with the practice of many years, jamal and salim zig zag down the warren of lanes. they dodge past people cooking in the doorways, sleeping, washing clothes or in the case of vinod, a naked four year old, pissing into the drain. salim shouts a warning.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{vinod! musketeers coming through!}
<A>__{without breaking step, they both jump expertly over the stream of piss. not so the security guard who gets it all over his trousers, but doesn't stop the pursuit. the two children charge past a shack filled to the roof with chickens in cages who all start squawking. they break out into the sunlight of the `main road' of the slum lined with shops. it is packed: with people, stalls, bicycles and cows. all modern india is here, drinking tea, shouting at each other, selling food, playing carom, video games. leaving a trail of shouting and wreckage behind them, the pair approach a brand new mercedes almost blocking the lane. beside it stands javed, an impressive man in a beautiful suit and his two minders. jamal and salim skid to a stop, put their hands together in respectful greeting and edge ever so carefully past the immaculate paintwork of the car. still in pursuit, the security guard also slides carefully past the car with deprecating bows and smiles. on past the chi stall where a crowd has gathered to watch a hindi film blaring from the tv rigged up overhead. the irate security guard gets tangled up in a bicycle. jamal and salim stop to give him a taunting, hip gyrating parody of the dance on the tv before scooting down another tunnel. they break out into sunlight again.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{jamal!}
<A>__{jamal skids to a halt, bumping into salim who is already frozen.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{shit. mummy ji.}
<C>__{jamal's mother}
<D>__{don't you move a muscle.}
<A>__{the security guard arrives and he too skids to a halt at the sight of jamal's mother.}
<C>__{jamal's mother }
<D>__{thank you, mister gupta. i will deal with these two.}
<A>__{the guard puts his hands together in grudging respect as jamal's mother lifts each skinny kid off the floor by their t shirt and marches them down the road.}
