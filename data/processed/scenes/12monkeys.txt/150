<A>__{close on a gorilla, by moonlight, angry, a true nightmare vision. urgent whispers off screen, rustling sounds. then, metal on metal. only now are we aware that the gorilla is in an outdoor zoo pen with phony rocks. stalking back and forth. huge. upset. clank. clank. metal on metal. grunts of effort, then, dr. mason's voice, plaintive, frightened.}
<C>__{dr. mason's voice }
<D>__{what are you doing to me? where are we? jeffrey, please...}
<C>__{sandy's voice }
<D>__{for god's sake, put the tape back on his mouth!}
