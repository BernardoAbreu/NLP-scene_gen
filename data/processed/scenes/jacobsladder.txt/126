<A>__{'s face as it registers terror and disbelief. he stares at the dancers. they are perverse, corrupt aspects of their normal selves. he is mesmerized by jezzie. her flesh has grown hard and wrinkled and has the markings of a snake. her tongue, long and curled, darts in and out of her mouth repeatedly. her eyes are thin and domineering. they lock jacob in their gaze. he wants to stop, to run, but jezzie won't release him. jacob grabs his eyes as though trying to pull the vision from them but it won't go away. the music throbs. his actions become spastic, almost delirious. his hysteria attracts the attention of the other dancers. a circle forms around jacob and jezzie as their frenzy transcends the boundaries of dance and erupts into an almost orgiastic display. jacob is out of control. his fury becomes a kind of exorcism, a desperate attempt to free himself from his body and his mind.}
