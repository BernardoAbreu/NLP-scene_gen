<A>__{klute gasps deeply entering orgasm. as soon as she hears it, judges it, she drops her hands from his shoulders, stills her own movements, lies utterly passive, smiling calmly, letting him finish for himself. he can't stop cries out cries out again, burying his face against her is done. then he slowly raises up, shuddering, looking down at her. he knows what she's done to him, is helpless to do anything back. he rolls slowly out of the embrace of her legs and lies silently looking upward, very much as we saw him at start of scene.}
