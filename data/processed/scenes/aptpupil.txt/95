<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{two orderlies push a gurney through the door. a man in his late thirties, david krauss, walks with them. a nurse, following behind, addresses him.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{he needs to rest now. you can come back tomorrow after ten.}
<A>__{david approaches the gurney. lying prone is ben krauss, 70. david kisses him on the forehead.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i will be back in the morning with the girls.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i can't wait to see them.}
<A>__{the orderlies lift ben onto his bed.}
<C>__{nurse}
<P>__{(to ben)}
<D>__{the doctor will be in to see you in a few minutes.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{the orderlies, the nurse and david leave the room. ben notices his roommate in the next bed. it is dussander, who has been watching all of this quietly.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{my nephew, david.}
<A>__{dussander smiles politely.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{his parents died when he was very young. he is like a son to me. i have no children of my own.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{david is very protective of me. of course, i don't mind. i enjoy his company. a few years ago he started working with me at the university. i teach chemistry. my name is ben, by the way.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{arthur.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{a pleasure, arthur. what do you do?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i'm retired.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{these tubes in my arm. no one said they would itch like this.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{you will find, in time, you don't notice.}
<A>__{ben looks oddly at dussander. the wheels of his memory slowly, very slowly, begin to turn.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well, we'll see. looks like i will be here for a while. i didn't want to alarm my nephew just yet, but this break in my leg... well, we'll see what the doctor says.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{yes, of course. but for now, you must forgive me, my medication has made me drowsy. do not be offended if i fall asleep.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{don't be offended if i keep talking anyway. it beats wondering if i'm ever going to walk again. i tell you, my friend, the ways of god are not meant to be understood.}
<A>__{but ben's words are lost on a sleeping man. he continues to stare at dussander.}
