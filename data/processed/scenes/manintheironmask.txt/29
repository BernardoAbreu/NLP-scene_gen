<L>__{interior palace michelle's new room day}
<A>__{michelle stands before the mirror, staring at herself, breaktakingly gorgeous in her new dress. she stares for a long time, surprised at her own beauty. she reaches to a vase of roses and pulls one out, blotting it around her neck, perfuming herself with its fragrance. she looks into the mirror, at her eyes... in guilt for what she is already feeling, she lifts raoul's letter to read it again. then she gasps the king stands right before her.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{sire! i how did you }
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{how did i get in? you're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. what is that?}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{... nothing.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{a letter. may i see?}
<A>__{he takes the letter; she has no resistance against him. the king reads, his eyes hardening suddenly; but then he smiles.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{from raoul. he urges you to guard your honor as if it could be in any danger... from your king.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{raoul... is in love...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{enough of this, our dinner waits.}
<A>__{tossing the letter aside, he offers her his arm. she takes it and allows him to escort her from the room.}
