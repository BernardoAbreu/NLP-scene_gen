<L>__{exterior train yard night}
<A>__{a woman's feet moving along the steel rail of a train track at night. the woman has no shoes, her feet bare. iris stumbles along the track, clutching one shoe pointlessly to her chest. she is swearing and crying, runny mascara leaving two tragic streaks down her pale face. despite this we see that she is attractive, though her dress and make up seem designed to convey overt sexiness. her white skin is complemented by a wild mane of curly red hair. she is in her early twenties, and the harshness of her life has just begun to harden her features. she looks lost and without hope, in fear of her life. her breath comes in hitching sobs, and her eyes are wild. she runs between cold steel walls of freight cars, looking behind her frequently. a police helicopter is circling. its xenon beam plays over the train yard, sweeping over the cars. she hunches into the shadows of a freight car as the beam passes over. looking under the cars she sees an lapd patrol car cruising down a street adjoining the yard, its searchlight sweeping toward her. it moves on. she continues her run, moving away from the direction of the patrol car. she reaches a chain link fence. crying, she scrambles over it, cutting her hands and ripping her dress. another patrol car passes two blocks away. she crouches in the tall grass until it rounds a corner out of sight.}
