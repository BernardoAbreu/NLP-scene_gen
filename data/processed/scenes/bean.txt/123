<A>__{the ancient g.p.o. phone starts to ring on a small table. (the following takes place in a matter of seconds). on the table are two, large, shiny, hard backed books, wedged up at one end and sloping away at right angles to one another. each book has a pair of rulers set, parallel to one another, in play doh. they each form a canal. between one pair of rulers sits a small box of salt. between the other pair is a miniature bust of beethoven. as the phone continues to ring and vibrate the table, these items judder along the canal, an inch at a time. the box of salt teaches the bottom of the book and topples over the edge of the table. ( the beethoven bust' teeters on the edge of its book). the salt lands in a plastic funnel, taped to the top of a bamboo stick. the bottom of the stick sits on the bbc 2 button of a t.v. remote control. close up of its infrared l.e.d. as it flashes once. the phone stops ringing.}
