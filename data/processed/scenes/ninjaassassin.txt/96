<A>__{the screams of dying men and gunfire shudder down the gullet of the old concrete building.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{fuck me...}
<A>__{she watches as the men position themselves, pressing into the black of the corridor. thumbs flick safeties to hot. a shriek pierces the silence, one of the agents suddenly jerked from his feet like a puppet on a string. they watch in ir as the agent falls to the ground in several pieces.}
<D>__{europol #2 what the fu }
<A>__{#2's exclamation gets caught in the oozing slit that opens in his throat. the man guarding raizo's cell door screams.}
<C>__{europol guard}
<D>__{they're not showing up on ir!}
<A>__{he clicks his flashlight the beam glinting against a hail of shuriken that pound into him, wounds flowering in ribbons of red. mika watches as he lands wetly at her feet. more screams and gunfire shake the shock from her. she dives for the guard, frantic fingers clawing at the key chain clipped to his belt. the remaining europol agents cluster together, flashlights strobing spastically, while mika slams through raizo's cell door. she instantly goes to work on his leg irons.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{come on come on }
<A>__{raizo's eyes narrow, the last of the europol agents butchered by shadows.}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{mika?}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{shh!}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{i don't want to sound critical }
<A>__{he can feel the rush of darkness.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{got it!}
<A>__{the leg irons click open and raizo springs forward the chain of his handcuffs catching a falling blade. he twists and the ring of metal on metal is followed by the dry snap of bone as raizo breaks the ninja's neck. she releases his handcuffs and they move quickly through the glistening remains of the bodies, raizo shielding her from the darkness.}
