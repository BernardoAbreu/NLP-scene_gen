<A>__{the mid afternoon sun shines down on the open air roman theater. the theater itself is almost two thousand year old. a semi circle of seats surrounds a huge stage wall, a massive structure which is one of the best preserved of its kind in the world. the gunmen enter at the bottom of the theater, holding ticket stubs. they are with a tour group led by an ancient geezer who speaks in rapid fire french. as the tour moves off to see the stage wall, the gunmen hang back and then separate from the crowd.}
