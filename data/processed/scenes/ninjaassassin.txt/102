<A>__{she twists the ignition and as the motor turns over the car's headlights explode, shattered by projectiles that seem to materialize from the void. mika screams throwing the car into gear peeling out toward the down ramp. the car fishtails down level after level through the oscillating light dark of the dimly lit exit ramp. her eyes twitch from mirror to mirror when she sees up ahead a shadow hanging in the corner of the tunnel like a spider. she ducks just as the front of the sedan is shredded by a squall of stars. the sedan rebounds into the light. its hood and windscreen looking as though it was gnawed on by a great white. mika cranks the wheel tearing around a dark bend as toom! something lands on the roof of the car. above her she sees the distinct tips of the tiger claws that have punctured the metal exterior of the car just as she passes under a light revealing a crouching ninja staring right at her, through the sun roof. his blade whips from its sheath but before he can strike she jams the barrel of the glock between the two tips of one set of claws, right where his foot should be and fires. a scream is followed by a gout of blood that washes over the sunroof the ninja's body tumbling off the back of the car. maslow's gnarled sedan bottoms out in a starburst of sparks as it corners into traffic. mika breathing heavy digs into her bag for her cell phone.}
