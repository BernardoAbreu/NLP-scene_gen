<A>__{watanabe bliss night she speaks emotionally, hoping to solicit sympathy:}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{he never says, 'honey i love you, you're doing a great job.' i don't feel he respects me as a person and i'm just not that happy with the stature of our relationship.}
<C>__{therapist }
<D>__{uhm hmm. i hear you.}
<A>__{on post graduate mfcc therapist seated behind a desk in a large deserted classroom:}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{now i want you to look at harry and tell him how you feel.}
<A>__{she turns her gaze to eugene earl axline, alias harry bliss. he sits in an adjacent chair, an abject hostage. discomforted by her flinty stare, he glances away, to the window where the faint sounds of the choral rehearsal can be heard.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{i feel like he's not plugged into my needs, and i'm not getting enough positive feedback...}
<A>__{harry shakes his head, shifting about uncomfortably.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{see, look at him shaking his head.}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{well, let's see what he wants to say here. harry, how do you feel when she brings out this material?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{how do i feel? i feel she just overheats on every little side issue, and when i go to try and communicate with the woman, for some unknown reason she doesn't believe a damn thing i say.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{oh that's a lie.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{see what i mean?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{no, you know what this whole thing hinges from? he came to rent a building from me which is now his place of business...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{so what, he's not interested in that, that's not what he's asking.}
<P>__{(to therapist)}
<D>__{see what she does? she wants to dig up and haul out miscellaneous things that's got nothing to do with this. i mean, i agreed to come here, okay, but i have to tell you, iwo jima's got a lot of faulty notions in her head about me that....}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{alright, there. right now. that's another thing i want to interject...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{pardon me, i was making a statement here.}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{yes, let's try and hear each other out if we can. go on, harry.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well, i forgot the upshot of what i was saying, but...}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{okay, this syndrome where i've asked him to address me by my given name and he just goes on ignoring my wishes.}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{alright. look at him and really tell him how you feel about that.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{i don't want you to ever call me iwo jima again!}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{that's a legitimate request, isn't it?}
<A>__{harry begrudges a slight nod.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{if you can't call me adele, don't call me anything at all.}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{so? can you look at iwo jima, harry, and tell her...}
<A>__{she darts a confused frown at the therapist.}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{better yet, can you take her by the hand and say, 'i hear what you're saying'?}
<A>__{reluctantly, he reaches over and takes her hand, mumbling something which though indistinct, causes adele's features to pucker with emotion and brings her to the edge of tears.}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{good. that's good... because there's a lot of love here, isn't there. (stealing a quick look}
<P>__{at his watch)}
