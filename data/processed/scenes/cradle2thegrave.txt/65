<A>__{he's about to punch it. when... a cop car turns a corner and falls in beside him. fait throttles back. keeps driving. until, finally... the cops turn off. and now... fait hits it. until... traffic ahead forces fait to turn into an alley in a semi industrial area. behind him, the escalade tries to follow, but is cut off by the on coming cars. we stay with fait. he guns down the alley. reaches an intersecting alley. turns. guns it out of sight.}
