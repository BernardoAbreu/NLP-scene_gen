<A>__{angle on pi, the raft and boat from above, lost on an endless ocean, the bright colors of morning light dancing on the surface of the water. pi has taken out his pencil and now writes on the back page of his survival manual, his voice heard over:}

<D>__{"my name is pi patel. i have been in a shipwreck. i am on a lifeboat alone with a tiger. please send help."}
<A>__{he tears the page out and stuffs it into an empty water can, sealing the opening with a plastic lid. he tosses it as far as possible; the can splashes down, rippling the water, then bobs, going nowhere. pi stares at the bobbing can, crushed as he sees the futility of this plan. a defeated pause, and then pi looks up and sees the majesty of his surroundings. the cloud cover breaks; dawn light glows down on pi. a grunt from the lifeboat. pi turns, surprised. he grabs the tow line and reels into the lifeboat. he lifts the tarp; richard parker's eyes glow out at him from the shadows, greeting pi with a low snarl. pi gingerly lowers the tarp and casts the raft back from the bow. he looks up.}

<P>__{(in awe, shuddering:)}
<D>__{god... i give myself to you. i am your vessel. whatever comes... i want to know. show me.}
