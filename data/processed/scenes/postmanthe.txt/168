<L>__{exterior edge of rubble day}
<A>__{ponytail, chubby, and draw watching from afar. chubby has the telescope.}
<C>__{chubby}
<D>__{you think that's president starkey?}
<A>__{ponytail takes the telescope from chubby for a look.}
<C>__{ponytail}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{chubby}
<D>__{what makes you so sure?}
<C>__{ponytail}
<D>__{president lives in a white house. that guy's place is gray.}
<A>__{drew and chubby exchange a look. that makes sense.}
<L>__{exterior sky day}
<A>__{a lightning bolt shreds the sky. it's day, but the sky is black with rain.}
<L>__{exterior high tension towers day}
<A>__{the useless towers cutting across a valley. rain beats down, as the postman and abby trudge along. up ahead, a rail road tunnel promises shelter from the storm.}
<C>__{the postman}
<P>__{(re: the tunnel)}
<D>__{we can rest in there.}
<A>__{abby is quick to agree. out of the corner of his eye, the postman catches a blur of movement. he turns his head quickly, but he's barely in time to see a wooden basket, attached to one of the high wires, swing from a distant tower. there's a sentry inside it. the basketed sentry whistles away at 40 mph, heading straight for an adjacent tower. in a matter of seconds, he's lost from view. the postman looks back at abby. she's shivering.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{did you see that?}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{i'm hungry, postman.}
<A>__{the postman guides her toward the train tunnel.}
