<L>__{interior laboratory day}
<A>__{a bevy of activity below us as the scientists prepare. matt slides the antigen cocktail into the centrifuge and starts it spinning. a sheet drapes over a sebastian's frame, straps across his limbs. he is fully wired. linda looks up to the observation booth.}

<A>__{matt removes the glowing vial of orange liquid from a centrifuge nearby. carter hands matt a hypo. matt jabs it into the vial, drawing up the colored liquid. linda sprays sebastian's arm with dye.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{ready?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{not really. i was just starting to enjoy myself.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{tough.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{okay, man. here we go.}
<A>__{matt inserts the hypo into the vein and presses down on the plunger. the liquid begins to react. small flashes of light blip up and down the strand of color outlining the vein. ba bump.. ba bump... the heartbeat starts to speed up.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{wait... something... something doesn't feel right.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{heartbeat elevated.}
