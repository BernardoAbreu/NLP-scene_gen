<L>__{interior westminster abbey day}
<A>__{a massive cavern of stone statuary and stained glass. the center piece of this particular section is the throne of edward the confessor. scaffolding is in the process of being erected to supply lighting for the coronation. archbishop lang and churchill inspect it with satisfaction.}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{only the vulgar ones.}
<A>__{churchill pours two nips of whiskey into metal cups nested in a hip flask.}
<C>__{winston churchill }
<D>__{to our new king.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{let's sincerely hope.}
<A>__{they look at each other in silence.}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{is this a `slightly pregnant pause'?}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{they say he is dim.}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{demonstrably untrue.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{they say he has epilepsy.}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{patently erroneous.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{fragile, prone to illness...}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{some correctness in that.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{...and will die prematurely. they predict he'll be unable to complete the coronation.}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{what do you propose? shorten the ceremony? or no ceremony at all?}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{my idea exactly!}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{i believed so. but what we need is a pageant of pomp and pomposity to impress the world.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{what we need, and what we'll get, may be two rather different things. did you hear his pathetic attempt at the accession council? he'll never be able to speak in public.}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{so, we plonk a tinsel crown on his head and lock him in a closet? who then will spiritually lead this great nation into war? who will address the far flung corners of the empire, rallying all to our defense?}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{the head of our church? is that what you have in mind?}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{would it be such a calamity?}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{best ask our new king.}
<A>__{bertie has entered with logue. lang spins around.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{your majesty.}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{excuse me, sir, duty calls.}
<A>__{he exits quickly. cosmo continues nervously as they walk through the abbey, the archbishop pointing out the preparations in progress, particularly a booth for broadcasters.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{is this the scene of the crime?}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{what a peculiar thing to say.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{referring to my assault upon the ears of the listeners.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{ah, yes, wireless is indeed a pandora's box. i have, however, categorically said no to the bbc's new "radio with pictures" gadget. imagine, the unwashed viewing us as we blow our noses or scratch our bottoms.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{radio with pictures?!}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{it is called..."television". happily, with a transmission range of only fifteen miles this "tv" thing has no future. we shall, however, be forced to permit cinema; the product of which i shall personally edit.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{that'll keep you busy, removing all my stops and starts.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{unless of course you'd prefer a quiet ceremony?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{what exactly do you mean?}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{something...discreet...private. we could pre record an edited version to be broadcast to the world. or even find an actor with a similar voice.}
<A>__{logue has arrived and comes out of the shadows.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{a king based upon deception?}
<A>__{cosmo takes bertie aside.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{if your gentleman from security would give us space, we could discuss this in private.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{you mean my bodyguard,"crusher?"}
<A>__{giving lionel a scathing look, lang continues speaking to bertie confidentially.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{fret not. as i assured our nation in my recent broadcast: "when his people listen to their new monarch they will note an occasional momentary hesitation in his speech. but to those who hear it, it need cause no sort of embarrassment, for it causes none to him who speaks." you see, i've paved the way. but should you wish to avoid further stress...}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{why not paint him pink and cover him with sequins?}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{pardon?!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{if you wish to call attention to his anxiety.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{does your bodyguard know to whom he's speaking? he certainly doesn't know his place!}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{doctor lionel logue, my speech therapist.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{therapist?! i'd no idea! had i known your majesty was seeking assistance i would've made my own recommendation.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{dr. logue is to be present at the coronation.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{impossibly to find room. even for a doctor.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{just lionel.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{behind the chair of edward the confessor.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{the royal box!? your family will be seated there.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{which makes it most suitable.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{perhaps i might be able to add a very small stool.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{two comfortable chairs. one for madam logue. she's a close friend of my wife. the queen.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{i will have someone attend to it.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{and now, if you don't mind, we need the premises.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{my dear fellow, this is westminster abbey! the church must make preparations.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{so must bertie.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{bertie?! we do not call the king: "bertie"!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i do. during waking hours we'll need the facilities. it'll be a closed set. no observers.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{those are my wishes, your grace.}
<A>__{lang nods curtly and exits.}
<C>__{bertie }
<D>__{you've made a dangerous enemy.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{wouldn't want him as a friend.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{and don't ever call me bertie in public.}
<A>__{a moment of confrontation. lionel knows he's overstepped.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{tell me...}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i sense one of your dreadful questions on the horizon.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{do you really want to be king?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{knew it! i haven't any choice.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{you can be a wounded king who stumbles through his coronation. or, as the arch of c so archly suggests, no coronation at all. always a choice.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{what's this, you wait til westminster abbey, then ambush me?}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i'm simply asking questions... which you seem unable to answer.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i'm a sacrificial lamb being led to slaughter! damn you!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{quite possibly. but at least i know what i want. you haven't the foggiest.}
<C>__{bertie}
<P>__{(explodes)}
<D>__{i want to be heard!}
<A>__{his words reverberate through the empty abbey.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{that's quite different. let's get down to work then, shall we?}
<A>__{bertie glares at him.}
<C>__{lionel }
<D>__{as soon as you and elizabeth enter the west door, you'll be greeted with the hymn "i was glad when they said unto me." you won't actually be that glad, because they sing it for a great long time.}
<A>__{bertie follows logue deep into the bowels of the `abbey'.}
<C>__{lionel }
<D>__{you'll then show yourself to the various sides of the abbey as the archbishop announces four times in a loud voice, "sirs, i here present unto you..." have you decided your name for when you become king? for when you become a different person?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{george.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{like your father?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{like my father.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{not albert?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{given the current situation...too germanic.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{"sirs, i here present unto you, george, your undoubted king!"}
<A>__{"george, your undoubted king!" echoes through the abby.}
