<L>__{interior martin's suite night}
<A>__{martin hunches over his briefcase that lays open on the bed.}
<B>__{martin pulls}
<A>__{the dossier from the briefcase. it's seal is broken, but the contents remain enclosed... he withdraws the package and dumps the contents on the bed. his face registers muted shock.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{dumb fucking luck...}
<B>__{the contents}
<A>__{include various photos of mr. newberry, mr. newberry with debi, and the house. the photos are mingled with official looking papers including credit reports, medical records, etc... newberry's life. he cocks his head toward the door anticipating a... knock. he freezes, then plucks a gun tapped under a desk, and moves toward the door, pointing. halfway to the door, his face and body slacken. he lobs the gun onto the bed. with everything gone wrong, there is nothing left to defend. he goes to the door and opens it, body relaxed, expecting a bullet... debi moves past him into the room. she is completely calm.}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{he was trying to kill you, right!}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{not the other way around...?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{is it something you've done?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{it's something i do...}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{...professionally...}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{...about five years now.}
<C>__{debi}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{get the fuck outta here.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{seriously, when i left, i joined the army and took the service exam. they found my psych results fit a certain profile. a certain "moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... i was loaned out to a cia sponsored program. it's called "mechanical operations." we sort of found each other...}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{you're a government spook?}
<A>__{martin says nothing.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i was, but no... yes... i was before, but now i'm not. it's irrelevant, really. the idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. but i will tell you something, until about five months ago, i really enjoyed my work.}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{jesus christ!}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{then i started losing my taste for it. which usually means your time is up. but then i realized it was something entirely different... i started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{okay. great, martin, that's just great. meaning to life... mmm....}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{like, that there's a point? an organic connection between all living things.}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{let me help you along, martin. you're a sociopath!}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{a sociopath kills for no reason. i kill for money.}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{you never could have kept this from me.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i was leaving.}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{that's probably a good idea.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{will you come with me?}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{i'm staying here.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{what if i come back?}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{i will hide.}
<A>__{she goes for the door.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{don't go.}
<A>__{she stops at the door. slowly, she turns.}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{you don't get to have me. you are a monster, i'm a human being. we're not going to mate.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{you don't understand...}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{that's because i speak human, and you speak monster.}
<A>__{debi bolts out of the room. martin is left alone. martin looks over at his gear on the bed. after a beat, he walks slowly over and surveys his tools. he picks up a cleaning rag and begins to go over the weapons, absently singing to himself...}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{"what's up doc? what's cookin'? what's up doc, are you lookin'...?}
