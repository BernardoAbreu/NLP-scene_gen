<L>__{interior courtroom day moments later}
<A>__{chutney takes her hand off of the bible and sits.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{ms. woods, begin your questioning.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{first, your honor, i ' d like to point out that not only is there no proof in this case, but there's a complete lack of mens rea, which by definition tells us that there is no crime without a vicious will.}
<A>__{the da rolls her eyes, as do the lawyers present.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i am aware of the meaning of mens rea. what i am unaware of is why you're giving me a vocabulary lesson instead of questioning your witness.}
<A>__{flustered, elle turns to chutney.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{okay ms. windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? was your father there?}
<C>__{chutney}
<D>__{not that i saw. but like i said, i went straight upstairs to take a shower.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{and when you came downstairs, what happened?}
<C>__{chutney}
<D>__{i saw brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{but mrs. windham didn't have a gun?}
<C>__{chutney}
<D>__{no, she'd stashed it by then.}
<A>__{brooke rolls her eyes.}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{move to strike that from the record, your honor. speculation.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{stricken.}
<A>__{elle mentally kicks herself for not doing this herself. eirimett gives her a reassuring nod. she takes a deep breath, then continues on.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{did you hear a shot fired?}
<C>__{chutney}
<D>__{no. i was in the shower.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{so at some point in the — twenty minutes? — you were in the shower, your father was shot?}
<C>__{chutney}
<D>__{i guess.}
<A>__{elle paces a bit. underdog watches from her purse on the table, intrigued by her line of questioning.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{your father was shot while you were in the shower?}
<A>__{gerard looks at emmett.}
<C>__{gerard}
<D>__{where's she going with this?}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{have a little faith.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{but you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.}
<C>__{chutney}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{yes. i was washing my hair.}
<A>__{elle's onto something, but not sure what.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{miss windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?}
<C>__{chutney}
<D>__{i got up, went to starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{where you got in the shower.}
<C>__{chutney}
<P>__{(impatient)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i believe the witness has made it clear that she was in the shower.}
<A>__{people start to murmur. donovan snickers. sarah looks worried.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{yes, your honor. had you ever gotten a perm before, miss windham?}
<C>__{chutney}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{the beginnings of a smile start to spread across elle's face.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{how many, would you say?}
<C>__{chutney}
<D>__{two a year since i was twelve. you do the math.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{you know, a girl in my sorority, tracy marcinko, got a perm once. even though we all told her not to curls really weren't the right look for her —}
<P>__{(chummy)}
<D>__{she didn't have your bone structure.}
<A>__{chutney almost smiles.}
<C>__{elle }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{but, thankfully, that same day, she entered the pi kap wet t shirt contest where she was completely hosed down from head to toe.}
<A>__{donovan shakes his head at her incompetence.}
<C>__{da joyce rafferty}
<D>__{objection. why is this relevant?}
<A>__{emmett clears his throat, worried. elle turns around, giving him a "trust me" look. then turns back to the judge.}
<C>__{elle}
<P>__{(to the judge)}
<D>__{i have a pointerior i promise.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{then make it.}
<A>__{elle looks at chutney.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{chutney, why is it that tracy marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?}
<C>__{chutney}
<D>__{because they got wet.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{that's right. because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de activating the ammonium thiglycolate?}
<A>__{chutney pales.}
<C>__{chutney}
<D>__{yes —}
<A>__{elle continues.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{and wouldn't someone who's had — thirty perms? — throughout her lifetime, be well aware of this rule?}
<A>__{chutney doesn't answer. she just glares at brooke.}
<C>__{elle }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and if you, in fact, were not washing your hair, as i suspect you were not, since your curls are still intact, wouldn't you have heard the gunshot?}
<A>__{chutney continues to glare.}
<C>__{elle }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then brooke windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. which would mean that you would've had to have found mrs. windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. isn't that right?}
<C>__{chutney}
<D>__{she's younger than i am. did she tell you that? how would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{you, however, had time to hide the gun, didn't you, chutney? after you shot your father?}
<A>__{brooke looks at chutney in horror, realizing.}
<C>__{chutney}
<D>__{i didn't mean to shoot him —}
<P>__{(to brooke)}
<D>__{i meant to shoot you!}
<A>__{pandemonium erupts. the gavel pounds.}
<C>__{brooke}
<D>__{i knew it!}
<A>__{elle looks at emmet t., elated at what's just happened.}
<C>__{elle}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{oh, my god!}
<C>__{emmett}
<P>__{(even more shocked)}
<D>__{oh, my g^d.! !}
