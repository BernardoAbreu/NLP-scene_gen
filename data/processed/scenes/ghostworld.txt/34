<L>__{interior enid's bedroom bathroom evening}
<A>__{enid dejectedly enters and heads straight for the bathroom. she rummages through a cabinet until she finds the right box (black hair dye). she wets her hair, then goes into the bedroom and mechanically turns on her boom box. the punk rock song we heard earlier plays. she yanks out the tape and flings it away. she skims through her records and cds, dismissing them all. she notices seymour's bag in the corner. she takes out the record and puts it on. the first tune is an upbeat instrumental number. she returns to the bathroom. several minutes pass. track two begins on the lp. she (and we) slowly begin to take notice. it's a strange, haunting old blues record. we see that the tune has struck a nerve.}
