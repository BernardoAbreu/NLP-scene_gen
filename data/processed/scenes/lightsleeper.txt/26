<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{lexington avenue}
<A>__{letour walks from his sedan around the corner to the lexington avenue entrance to grace towers, a pre war apartment building. in the lobby, he gives his name to the security guard, is directed to the express elevator. he exits on the thirtieth floor; footsteps muted by thick carpet. victorian prints on dark blue walls. he looks about, approaches a door, presses the buzzer. thomas opens the door; john enters tis' opulent apartment. salle and clemente hang on the walls; new york twinkles outside panoramic windows. a pipe and syringe lie atop art books. tis, in jogging sweats, comes from the bedroom to greet him.}
<C>__{tis}
<D>__{tour, just in time. we were out. nineteen, right?}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{thirty eight hundred got any hundreds?}
<C>__{tis}
<D>__{some, not the whole thing.}
<P>__{(to thomas)}
<D>__{you got hundreds?}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{letour hands him a plastic bag of gram envelopes. tis opens a packet, pours the contents on the coffee table.}
<C>__{tis}
<D>__{i like that about ann. always takes the time to grind it. if you do it, do it right.}
<A>__{john hears footsteps, turns to see marianne stumble out of the bedroom! she looks terrible: shoeless, blouse out, hair undone, bruise on her forehead perhaps she fell against something hands trembling.}
<C>__{tis}
<P>__{(to marianne)}
<D>__{looks like you could use some help.}
<P>__{(marianne looks up, sees john, goes pale)}
<D>__{mari, this is tour. you got any hundreds?}
<A>__{john stares speechless: the girl who won't talk to him because he's a dealer. marianne bolts back into the bedroom, slams the door!}
<C>__{tis}
<D>__{not the talkative type. haven't seen her in years. you know her, don't you?}
<P>__{(no answer. tis counts}
<D>__{the money, offers}
<P>__{it. letour is frozen)}
<D>__{why they call me? what a nightmare.}
<P>__{(extending money)}
<D>__{you want it or not?}
<C>__{letour}
<P>__{(vacant)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{letour pockets the cash. tis, his arm on john's elbow, "walks" him to the door:}
<C>__{tis}
<D>__{see you later.}
<A>__{tis nudges john to the corridor, closes the door behind him. john looks toward the elevator; tis, behind the door, calls "marianne!" time cut: letour stands in the elevator, red floor numbers flashing past, blank eyes mirrored in dark glass.}
