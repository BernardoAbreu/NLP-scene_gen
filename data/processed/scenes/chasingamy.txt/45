<L>__{int hockey rink night}
<A>__{on the ice, two teams clash, chasing the puck up and back, checking galore. in the bleachers, amidst a slew of fans, alyssa watches the game with a large degree of enjoyment. sitting beside her, holden doesn't seem to share her enthusiasm.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{since most of these people are rooting for the home team, i'm going to cheer for the visitors. i'm a big visitors fan especially the kind that make coffee for you in the morning before they go.}
<P>__{(smiles at holden; no response)}
<D>__{that was a joke. a little wacky wordplay?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{what do you mean, 'visitors'?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{was i being too obscure? the kind that until recently had no dicks and would spend the night.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{so that was until recently!}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{oh, yeah.}
<P>__{(shouting; to ice)}
<D>__{hey foul! foul! he was traveling or something!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{so nobody bur me has stayed the night at your place since we got together?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{something on your mind, holden?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{no, i was just wondering,}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{if i've been 'faithful' or something?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{look, i was just asking.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(toucher his face)}
<D>__{oh, sweetie. i only have eyes for you.}
<P>__{(to ice)}
<D>__{call that fucking shit, ref!! the guy on the skates totally shoved one of my guys!!}
<P>__{(to holden)}
<D>__{i told you i was great at sporting events. imagine what a bitch i could be if i knew what was going on?}
<A>__{on the ice things heat up between two opposing players. one snatches the puck away from the other and skates off. the other player gives chase. alyssa's very into the game. holden shakes his head}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{that'd make banky half right.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{he said all the girls from north were bitches and sluts.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{really. i'm sorry you two left high school behind how many years ago?}
<P>__{(grabs his face and kisses his cheek)}
<D>__{can i put some of my books in your locker?}
<P>__{(goes back to watching game)}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{how about your yearbook.}
<A>__{on the ice the player giving chase slashes the player with the puck. alyssa jumps to her feet.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(to ice)}
<D>__{if you don't start using that whistle i'm gonna jam it straight up your ass!!}
<P>__{(to guy next to her)}
<D>__{right?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{what's with 'finger cuffs'?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(sitting back down)}
<D>__{'finger cuffs'?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{yeah. in your senior yearbook your nickname was 'finger cuffs'. what is that?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{it was? shit, damned if i can remember. i'd look it up, but i threw all that shit our years ago?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{where'd you see a north yearbook?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{do you know rick derris?}
<A>__{on the ice the players skid into the corner where player one checks player two into the boards, hard. player two scrambles to his feet and throws down his gloves. the crowd around alyssa and holden go wild.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{rick? sure. we used to hang out in high school.}
<P>__{(to ice)}
<D>__{punch him in the fucking neck, number twelve!!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{did you go out with him or something?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(eyes on the ice)}
<D>__{date rick derris? no. we just hung out a lot.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{just... you and him?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{no. me, rick, and... um... what was that guy's name...?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{cohee?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{yeah! cohee lundin. god, i haven't thought about that name in years.}
<A>__{on the ice the players square off. player two pulls player one's helmet off and punches him in the face. holden looks as if he'd like to do the same to his companion. alyssa's into the game.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i remember those guys'd come over almost everyday after school. they'd bug my sisters, look for porno tapes in my dad's closet, raid our fridge. they really took advantage of my parents never being home.}
<A>__{on the ice player two yanks at player one's jersey and gut punches him. alyssa seems oblivious to holden's anger, so enthralled with the action is she.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(starts laughing)}
<D>__{this one day... rick pulled out his dick and chased me around the house with it! right in front of cohee! i couldn't believe it! guys are weird i thought the whole size hang up made you all terrified to show your dicks to each other?}
<A>__{on the ice player one staggers a bit, then quickly rights his jersey and lunges at player two, landing a barrage of his own punches. blood sprays across the ice. holden's face is reeeeeaaaally sour looking. alyssa's still in the game.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{rick pulled his dick out? really? what'd you do?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(looks him dead in the eye)}
<D>__{i blew him while cohee fucked me.}
<A>__{on the ice player one delivers the kill shot, slamming his fist into player two's nose. the blood shoots out like a geyser, and two goes down hard. holden stares at alyssa, flabbergasted. the crowd around them stares not at the fight on the ice, but the fight in their midst, shocked. alyssa fumes.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{excuse me!?!}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{that's what you wanted to hear, isn't it? isn't that what this little cross examination of your's is about? well try not to be so obvious about it next time, there are subtler ways of badgering a witness.}
<P>__{(to bystander)}
<D>__{am i right?}
<C>__{bystander}
<P>__{(to holden)}
<D>__{jeez, even i knew what you were getting at.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(gathering her stuff)}
<D>__{if you wanted some background information on me, all you had to do was ask i'd have gladly volunteered it. you didn't have to play hercules fucking poirot!}
<A>__{she storms away. holden chases after her. the bystander watches them go.}
<C>__{bystander}
<P>__{(to companion)}
<D>__{i told you these were good seats.}
