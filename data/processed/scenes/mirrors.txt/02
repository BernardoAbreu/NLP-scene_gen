<L>__{interior night subway public restroom}
<A>__{the place is deserted as well. one of the mirrors is smashed while the others are covered by graffiti and dirt the neon lights are flickering, bringing the place in and out of the dark. the man checks each stall one at a time. his face lights up as he looks inside the last one }
<B>__{a small window above the toilet is just big enough for him to crawl through.}
<A>__{he steps onto the toilet seat but the window is shut too tight. after a brief struggle, he swings it open, only to discover a wall of bricks. panic returns to his eyes. he slowly opens the stall door, fearful of what could be waiting outside. a faint sound of shattering glass is heard. he quickly shuts the door, holding his breath. frozen. silence. his heart racing, he exits the stall in the direction of the sound. the place is empty. the room is revealed by flashes of flickering neon lights. he moves closer to the sinks and the spiderweb cracked mirror. his image is fragmented and deformed. it resembles a cubist portrait.}

<D>__{i'm sorry... i... i... i wasn't trying to get away...}
<A>__{he talks to his own reflection in the mirror }
<C>__{man }
<D>__{no, please don't...}
<A>__{he approaches and starts crying like a child. his head resting against the mirror, he pleads for his life. then, seeing the dirt and grime on the mirror, his behaving shifts to another extreme. he starts cleaning it frantically with his hands. too frantically a piece of the spiderweb cracked mirror falls on the ground. immediately, he bends down to pick it up but his reflection in the mirror remains standing in silence,}
<B>__{watching him.}
<A>__{looking up, the man realizes his reflection has become independent. a separate being... terrified, he slowly stands staring at his stationary double. the pointy and sharp piece of broken mirror in his hand reflects the neon lights just like a knife blade. his eyes turn cold with fear when his double in the mirror stabs itself deep in its throat! in reality, the man has not moved an inch, yet his throat rips open, releasing a river of blood. void of any facial expression, the man's reflection slices his jugular from end to end. in reality, the man chokes on his own blood which splatters on the mirror turning the image to a dark deep red.}
