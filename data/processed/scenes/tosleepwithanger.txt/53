<L>__{exterior mrs. baker's backyard day}
<A>__{rodney walks around in the yard blowing his trumpet as loud as he can. the sound of the trumpet frightens skip's birds.}
<L>__{interior bathroom day}
<A>__{gideon is repairing the pipes under the face bowl. harry is leaning against the door.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{how often is your wife called to help delivery?}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{it was slow. now it seems like everyone is having births at home.}
<A>__{gideon takes the pipe off. it has rotted. gideon cannot believe it.}
<C>__{gideon }
<D>__{what could have caused this? i just changed this damn thing.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{everything these days is made overseas.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{you and babe brother hit it off so well.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{course, it is your business, but i feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{i tried to teach him right from wrong just like i did his junior.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{everyone has to follow his own plough. a man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. city people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. you don't plant old ways...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. you sell it to a stranger. you worked your whole life, for what?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. all what we've experienced has no meaning.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{you're suppose to teach your children what you know. junior, i don't have to worry about. babe brother is a different story.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you still call him boy. you call babe brother boy in front of his wife and son.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{my daddy called me boy up to the time he died. i was always boy to him.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{'course, you could be right. your sons are alive. all my sons are dead.}
<A>__{off screen, rodney starts to practice on his horn.}
