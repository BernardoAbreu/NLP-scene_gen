<L>__{interior ballroom night}
<A>__{brad and janet find themselves on a balcony of a huge black and silver ballroom. at the furthest end is a throne like chair and, surrounding it, a theatre proscenium. in the body of the room are guests. they are the people brad and janet passed on the road. they are the transylvanian secret agents assembled on this special occasion from all over the earth. it is the annual transylvanian convention announced by an official banner suspended over the ballroom. they are all dressed in strange but elegant evening wear. they are a distorted version of the guests from the denton wedding. a party spirit prevails, they throw their arms out in a plea to riff raff on the balcony.}
