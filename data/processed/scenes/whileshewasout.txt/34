<L>__{exterior mall parking lot evening}
<A>__{steps down from the ford right into a puddle. the dirty water splashes up onto her pants.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{great!}
<A>__{she shakes the boot off and looks over at the mall. it's at least a half mile away, glimmering in the distance. she sets off marching across the lot, taking what seems to be the most direct route. maybe she can shake off this mood by the time she gets inside. she passes the plymouth, turns, stares back at it. the car is dirty gold and riddled with rust holes with a vinyl roof that's almost peeled away. she walks up close, tries to decipher the plate, but it's caked with mud. annoyance rises like bile in her throat. she finds herself reaching into her purse, rummaging for a small notebook, then a sharpie. she leans on the car as she writes. dear jerk, it's great you could use up two parking spaces on a night like this. ever hear of the joy of sharing? signed,}
<B>__{a concerned friend.}
<A>__{she scans her words. pretty good! della rips the piece of paper from the notebook, folds the note several times and slides it under the plymouth's windshield wipers. the driver can't miss it. she smiles. that felt good! head held high she marches on towards the mall. the camera pulls up so we can see the mall, see della marching across the lot, see the crowds of shoppers entering and exiting the mall, and get the feeling that maybe somebody just saw her.}
