<L>__{interior doug's bathroom night}
<A>__{doug opens the medicine cabinet and grabs a q tip. wiggles it around in his ear and when he takes it out there's a hornet sitting on the cottony tip, scissoring its wings. doug stares in disbelief. mouth gaping. he throws the q tip in the toilet. hits the flush lever. watches the hornet spiral away. gone. stares at the empty bowl. did i just imagine that? shaken, he turns to the sink. wedges his head under the tap and runs water into his ear. straightens and looks at himself in the mirror, toweling his face, trying to impose rational thought on the situation. but as the water spills from his ear, down his neck, onto his shirt, it brings with it two more live hornets, half drowned. with a yelp doug swipes them from his shirt. crushes them underfoot. terrified, but clinging to rational thought a moment longer, he turns his head sideways to the mirror, parts his hair, and sees another hornet crawl from the ear canal, followed by six or seven more!}

<D>__{fuck!}
<A>__{rationality goes out the window. he flails at them with the towel. swats them dead. picks them up and drops them in the toilet. studies the last one for a moment. its little legs twitching. drops it in. flushes. a false respite. and a brief one. because as the flushing noise fades he can hear an ominous deep buzzing sound rising. it's coming from behind him. he turns to have a look. nothing there. bare wall. but it's strange: the buzzing is still behind him. with dawning horror doug turns and checks his back in the mirror, sees his entire shirt back is crawling with hornets! whimpering like a child, he undoes the buttons of his shirt, taking it off as delicately as possible. slipping his arms gently from the sleeves. holding it by the collar, he takes two quick steps and tosses it in the shower. slams the glass door, seals the crack with towels. and watches the hornets fly around in the glass enclosure, buzzing furiously, bouncing off the glass. but as he backpedals he realizes the furious buzzing is too close, too loud and too deep, to be coming from the shower over there. a sharp pain in his head confirms it. he groans and brings a hand to his ear as something awful happens inside. the buzzing in his right ear spreads to his left louder, angrier, its sources multiplying. disoriented, he stumbles backwards with an agonizing scream. catches sight of himself in the mirror, the terror of the moment on his face. this can't be happening. and now the nightmare takes a devilish turn. looking at himself in the mirror, he sees }

<A>__{entire swarm raging inside his skull, fighting its way out! doug grabs his head in both hands and starts shaking it, trying to shake away the madness inside. but the hornets keep coming, coughed up in clumps as he gasps for air. they're all over him, stinging his tongue, his eyes. he goes berserk and starts smashing his head against the wall, the door, the edge of the sink, anything he can find, opening a deep gash in his forehead, smashing it harder and harder because the buzzing won't stop, cracking his skull, screaming hysterically, pitching his head violently forwards and backwards like some demon possessed heavy metal fanatic. it's a grotesque display that ends on a sickening note when, with one particularly violent head jerk, he snaps his own neck crack!!! he sinks to the floor, head askew, astonished look on his face. and there he sits, paralyzed, eyes locked on the tv in the living room where football highlights play in silence. fully conscious as the hornets fight their way back into his ears, nose, and mouth a pilgrimage back to the mind that bore them.}
