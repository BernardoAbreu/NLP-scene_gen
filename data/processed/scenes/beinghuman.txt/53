<L>__{exterior wagon day}
<A>__{hector catches up with the moving wagon and jumps onto it, happily back in the security of his fellow travellers. he smiles at beatrice.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{a bit cold... walking...}
<A>__{she smiles at him. he sits opposite her in the wagon, and allows his foot to touch hers. she doesn't move away. hector calls to the driver.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{how long to get there?}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{when it gets dark, we'll be there.}
<A>__{hector looks at beatrice.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i thought i heard fighting... back there...}
<A>__{beatrice replies, but in a language that hector doesn't understand.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{i don't know what you're saying... i haven't understood anything you've said all day...}
<A>__{hector talks back to her.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i don't know what you're saying...}
<A>__{they both smile. it doesn't seem to disturb them too much that they don't share a language. they repeat their incomprehensible statements, just for the fun of it.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{i don't know what you're saying.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<A>__{beside hector the girl has stopped sobbing but she is still troubled. she turns to him and speaks quietly but with determination.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i want to go home to my mother.}
<A>__{hector doesn't know how to respond. he can do nothing to help her, and anyway, is more interested in beatrice.}
