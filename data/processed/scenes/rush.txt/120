<L>__{exterior nurburgring day}
<A>__{james arrives at the race track, to find alastair caldwell waiting for him, a concerned look on his face...}
<C>__{caldwell}
<D>__{we've just been told, a driver's meeting has been called.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{who by?}
<C>__{caldwell}
<D>__{niki.}
<A>__{james's face. instantly suspicious.}
<L>__{interior meeting room nurburgring race track day}
<A>__{about sixty people, (26 drivers and all the different team representatives), are assembled in the room, where a blazered fia official and a member of the drivers safety committee are sitting behind a table... a buzz of anticipation and curiosity. what's going on? what is all this about? niki gets to his feet, raises his hands calling for silence...}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{thank you. i called this meeting because as all drivers know the nurburgring is a race track from the stone ages. the most stupid, barbaric, outdated, dangerous, track in the world. you've all seen the rain which has been falling this morning. those of you with experience know the ring needs perfect conditions to be even remotely acceptable in terms of risk. as you can see today is anything but perfect, so i called this meeting to take a vote to cancel the race.}
<A>__{a ripple of astonished reactions among the drivers..}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{there would be no change to the situation as far as points is concerned. the race would simply be cancelled.}
<A>__{teddy mayer looks over at ferrari representatives....}
<C>__{mayer}
<D>__{this is bullshit...}
<A>__{another driver (guy edwards) gets to his feet...}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{if the race is cancelled, none of us get our race fees...}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{it's true. you leave without your fee, but you might leave with your life.}
<A>__{another voice pierces the controversy...}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{it also means you would effectively win the championship.}
<A>__{it's james hunt, who is standing up...}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{so i can see why this suits you just fine.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{why? there would be no points for me either...}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{but there would be one race less where i, or anyone else, could catch you.}
<A>__{uproar in the room...}
<C>__{brett lunger}
<D>__{james is right! this is just tactics!}
<C>__{arturo merzario}
<D>__{ferrari's dirty tricks! we've seen it before!}
<C>__{harald ertl}
<D>__{maybe it's just that he's frightened?}
<A>__{laughter among the drivers...}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{which asshole said this?}
<A>__{silence. no hand goes up. no one has the courage to own up.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{yes, i am frightened. always a little bit when i race. i accept every time i get in my car there is 20% chance that i could die. but not one per cent more. and today, with the rain the risk is more. how dare you accuse me of lack of courage? let me remind you. i have the track record here. i am the only person in history to do the ring in under 7 minutes. so actually it's to my advantage to race here today. because i'm quicker than all of you.}
<A>__{a stunned silence. one voice pierces the room...}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{fine. then let's race!}
<A>__{it's james who stares at niki: a ripple of excitement and enthusiasm among the other drivers...}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{there's a hundred thousand fans out there who would never forgive us if we didn't.}
<C>__{merzario}
<D>__{and some of us need our race fees!!}
<C>__{fia official}
<D>__{all those in favour of cancelling the race?}
<A>__{niki puts his hand up. one or two other racers, too...}
<C>__{fia official}
<D>__{all those in favour of racing?}
<A>__{james puts his hand up. clearly the more popular, charismatic figure among the drivers, everyone else follows.}
<C>__{fia official}
<D>__{gentlemen, start your engines!!}
<A>__{a clear victory for james. he has swung the room. everyone leaves the room. james and teddy mayer give one another a discreet hi five... but we rack focus through the crowd to see niki staring at james accusingly...holding his gaze.}
