<L>__{exterior cider house morning}
<A>__{as the men sit at the picnic table eating their cornbread, rose rose pours coffee. a jeep comes down the orchard road toward them. it's olive. mr. rose leads the "good mornin', mrs. worthin'ton!" greeting. olive has an armful of clothing and a fairly sizable package; she brings the latter over to homer.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{some mail for you, homer.}
<A>__{homer shakes the package; he puts the package beside the table, unopened. olive turns to rose rose.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{and some clothes for you, dear }
<P>__{(nodding to the cider house)}
<D>__{let's go see if they fit.}
<A>__{mr. rose watches rose rose and olive disappear into the cider house. the other men view homer's package with curiosity, especially peaches.}
<C>__{peaches}
<D>__{ain't you gonna see what it is, homer?}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{mind your own business, peaches.}
<C>__{peaches}
<D>__{sorry, homer...}
