<A>__{railly takes a travel book on key west from a rack, considers it, includes it with several magazines she's holding. she doesn't notice mr. ponytazl enter the gift shop behind her! the p.a. system drones flight info as railly checks her watch and frowns. it's getting late and where's cole? she turns, heads for the cash register to make her purchases. mr. ponytail, seen from behind, is at the cash register already. he sets a newspaper on the counter and searches for change. the paper features a banner headline..."animals set free" and a sub head..."prominent scientist found locked in gorilla cage" over a photo of dr. mason being released from the cage and another photo of a gorilla perched atop a parked car. stepping in line behind mr. ponytail, railly checks her watch again. then, mr. ponytail, having paid, turns to go and railly looks up and sees his face. though it is not visible to us. startled, railly frowns. does she know this man? mr. ponytail pauses for a moment, considering the babe in the shades, gaudy earrings, the tight skirt, and high heels. railly doesn't recognize the man, but we do! he's dr. mason's assistant, dr. peters...the man who attended railly's lecture! smiling, dr. peters steps around railly and exits the gift shop. still puzzled, railly puts her purchases on the counter and the clerk starts ringing them up as a delivery man comes in and drops a bundle of newspapers at her feet. railly's pov: the front page shows a photo of three frightened giraffes in freeway gridlock under a headline proclaiming, "terrorists create chaos". further down are two more photos...dr. mason in the gorilla cage and a file photo of dr. mason in his lab. close on the shot of dr. mason in his lab. there's someone else in the picture. it's a man wearing a lab coat and a ponytail! angle on railly, reacting, suddenly remembering! memory flashback! interior reception room breitrose hall night railly looks up from the book she's signing and sees dr. peters.}
