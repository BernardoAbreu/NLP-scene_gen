<L>__{ext oak grove sunset}
<A>__{a clearing by a creek with a cluster of small oaks. ringo leans against a tree, sipping from a hip flask, smoking a slim cheroot. we hear the chiming spurs approach. ringo looks up as the tall silhouette of his enemy emerges from the shadows of the thicket.}
<C>__{ringo}
<D>__{well, didn't think you had it in you.}
<P>__{(smiles, sets himself)}
<D>__{shall we?}
<C>__{dark silhouette}
<D>__{i'm your huckleberry.}
<A>__{ringo stiffens as the silhouette steps into the waning light. it's doc, pale and drawn, looking like death itself, but awake and ready just the same:}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{why johnny ringo, you look like somebody just walked over your grave.}
<P>__{(sees his shock)}
<D>__{oh, i wasn't quite as sick as i made out.}
<C>__{ringo}
<D>__{my fight's not with you, holliday.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i beg to differ. we started a fight we never got to finish. play for blood, remember?}
<C>__{ringo}
<D>__{i was kidding about that.}
<A>__{for the last time, that cheshire cat smile comes over doc's face:}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i wasn't.}
<P>__{(pins on wyatt's badge)}
<D>__{and this time it's legal.}
<A>__{ringo nods, his hock replaced by a growing malice. as they set themselves, once again their eyes begin to blaze, boring into each other, their concentrated rage focusing on each other, about to reach critical mass....}
<C>__{ringo}
<D>__{all right, lunger. let's do it.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{say when.}
<A>__{a long tense moment then both grunt in unison. blurred movement, the flash of a gunshot. doc slaps his gun back in it's holster as ringo stumbles, a bullet hole in the side of his head....}
