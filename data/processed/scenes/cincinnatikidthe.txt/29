<A>__{featuring one bathing suit displayed among others in an end of season sale with some such advertising message as "all bathing suits reduced 1 3 for clearance!" the particular suit is a two piece one, exposing two or three inches of bare midriff the first modest forerunner of the trend that led eventually to the bikini.}
<C>__{christian's voice }
<D>__{would you wear it in public?}
<A>__{camera pulls back to include christian and melba looking at the display.}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{wouldn't be much point wearing it in private. sure, why not, as long as you don't have a bulge to hide?}
<A>__{they start walking.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{i don't know, melba.}
<C>__{melba}
<P>__{(looking her over)}
<D>__{my guess is there isn't anything about you needs hiding. but i will give you a more definitive opinion at the bath.}
<C>__{christian}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{at the what?}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{turkish bath. after we're through shopping. i'm treating you, christian.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{i never been. i'm not even sure what you do.}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{you don't do anything. that's what's so marvelous. they do it to you.}
