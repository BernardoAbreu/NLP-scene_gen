<A>__{the shelter is dark. lednov strikes a match and looks around. the place is empty. there is a bunk, made up. on the left hand wall a curtain of gunny sacks covers the clothes hanging there. the match burns down to lednov's fingers. there is a sound of a scuffle outside a blow, and a groan. lednov drops the match and hurries out.}
