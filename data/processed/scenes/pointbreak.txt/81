<A>__{looking up from the bottom, we see the silhouettes of two boards surrounded by pulsing shafts of moonlight. camera tilts down to show the bottom. the dreamlike blue light shimmering on the sand and rocks. a big shark browses gracefully, ignoring the lovers. their moment of harmony with the sea will be honored.}

<A>__{tyler's porsche stands alone in an empty lot. her surfboard sticks up in back, next to utah's "stealth fighter". rosie's fire is burning low. tyler, half wrapped in a blanket from the car, straddles johnny on the sand like she straddles her board. the blanket slips down. naked silhouettes in the firelight. she arches her back as they move together in prefect sync. grips his shoulders and stares into his face, her teeth bared in a grimace of pleasure that looks like pain. she makes love like she does everything... with honesty and intensity. utah, surprisingly, is gentle and slow. he strokes her hair after she collapses onto him.}
