<L>__{interior queenshithe slaughterhouse factory floor}
<A>__{a massive space with a maze of machinery full of deadly gears and blades and saws, lifeless and silent for now. an automated butchery on a grand scale. this is the killing floor. huge hooks hang from chain belts on an i beam, the ceiling, swaying softly, whispering in the wind. on the high walls, a huge number has been scrawled:}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{one eighteen. it's a date, a time?}
<A>__{holmes shakes his head, his eyes narrow, ticking.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it's chapter and verse. revelation 1:18. `i am he that liveth, and was dead.'}
<A>__{another voice completes the passage, echoing from above:}
<C>__{blackwood }
<D>__{`and behold, i am alive forevermore, and have the keys of hell and of death. amen.'}
<A>__{holmes and watson follow the voice to see: blackwood in the rafters. shadows hang heavy around him. holmes and watson react: this is the first time they've seen him in the flesh.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{i cautioned you to accept that this is beyond your control. now you see the truth for yourself.}
<A>__{the hooks in the ceiling are shivering softly, strangely. holmes tightens. blackwood continues, his voice echoes, as the hooks move through the air, gliding on a track.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{i want you to bear witness. at noon tomorrow, the world as you know it ends.}
<A>__{watson pulls his gun, draws a bead on blackwood, pulls the trigger. click. misfire.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{and because i appreciate your help, holmes, i have a gift for you.}
<A>__{holmes starts climbing up towards blackwood.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<P>__{(voice moving away)}
<D>__{she followed you. you led your little lamb straight to slaughter.}
<A>__{suddenly the whole machine starts up. industrial strength loud, movement everywhere, empty hooks jerking towards the processing line. blades and gears and grinders churn. watson's eyes go from blackwood to a pig carcass as it comes swinging out of the killing area, towards the scorcher (which scorches the carcasses with live flame). then next carcass emerges not a carcass, irene. she is alive, for now. she hangs from two hooks on a track line, her wrists shackled above her, her mouth gagged. her eyes show terror until she sees them, then immense relief for a moment, then determination. holmes looks up to see blackwood's shadow retreating. decision time.}
