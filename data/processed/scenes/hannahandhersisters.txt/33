<A>__{upbeat jazz begins to play and the film cuts to: the facade of mount sinai hospital. it is day. a few cars whiz by as the film moves inside, to various scenes depicting mickey's comprehensive exam. first is a hearing test, and the movie cuts to a darkened hearing test room. a light goes on, revealing a slouched over mickey sitting in a glass booth. he is wearing a set of headphones. the camera moves back, revealing a technician at the console on the other side of the booth. mickey signals with his finger when he hears a sound on his headset. the jazz continues. next is an electronystagmography (eng). graph paper rolls out of a machine, and after a brief glimpse of the rolling paper, the camera moves over to show mickey lying terrified, without his glasses, on a couch, with electrodes stuck all over his head. the film then cuts to a bser test room, where mickey, sitting in a corner chair, wears another set of headphones. an electrode is attached to his forehead; a nearby technician sits at a computer video screen, looking at a monitoring graph. last but not least is the tomography. over the shoulders of a technician in a booth, a large window displays a huge, white rotating machine. it makes a whooshing noise as it turns. the camera moves down the giant cranelike device to reveal mickey, once again lying down, this time on a table, his eyes closed, underneath it.}
