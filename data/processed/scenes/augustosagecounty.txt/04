<D>__{the reasons why we partake are anymore inconsequential. the hallway, walls lined with photos of long dead pioneer ancestors and faded school photographs of three daughters.}
<C>__{beverly }
<D>__{the facts are: my wife takes pills and i drink. that's the bargain we've struck, just one paragraph of our marriage contract... cruel covenant. and these facts have over time made burdensome the maintenance of traditional american routine. she makes her way to the stairs starts down.}

<D>__{rather than once more vow abstinence with my fingers crossed in the queasy hope of righting our ship, i've chosen to turn my life over to a higher power and join the ranks of the hiring class. the light from the study slices across the living room.}
<C>__{beverly }
<D>__{it's not a decision with which i'm entirely comfortable. i know how to launder my dirty undies. done it all my life, but i'm finding it's getting in the way of my drinking. she can see a portion of beverly's desk, a woman's legs.}
<C>__{beverly }
<D>__{sorry about the heat in here. my wife is cold blooded and not just in the metaphorical sense. she does not believe in air conditioning... as if it is a thing to be disbelieved. i knew your father, you know. bought many a watermelon from mr youngblood's fruit stand. he did pass, didn't he??}

<D>__{am i looking through window? a window?}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{can you come here? she steps into the study, emerging from the darkness into light to reveal: violet weston. dissipated, dishevelled, late sixties. she wears pajamas and a much slept in robe.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{oh. hello. she's staring at a woman sitting in front of beverly's desk: johnna. thirty, native american, simply dressed.}

<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{i myself require very little attention, thrive without it, sort of a human cactus. my wife has been diagnosed with a touch of cancer, so she'll need to be driven to tulsa for her final chemotherapy treatments. you're welcome to use that american made behemoth parked out in the drive. welcome to make use of anything, everything, all this garbage we've acquired, our life's work. do you have any questions?}
