<L>__{interior clementine's apartment night}
<A>__{candles are lit. joel and clementine are under a blanket on the living room rug listening to music.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{joely...}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{yeah, tangerine?}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{do you know the velveteen rabbit?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{it's my favorite book. since i was a kid. it's about these toys. there's this part where the skin horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{i can't believe i'm crying already. he says, "it takes a long time. that's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. generally by the time you are real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. but these things don't matter at all, because once you are real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."}
<A>__{she's weeping. joel is stroking her hair. they kiss and begin to make love under the blanket. it's sweet and gentle and then it starts to fade.}
<C>__{joel}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{no! jesus, no!}
<A>__{he looks down and clementine's tear streaked face is fading. she continues as if she's still being made love to, even though joel is completely beside himself. he jumps up naked and yells at the ceiling.}
<C>__{joel }
<D>__{please! please! i've changed my mind!}
<P>__{(looks down at fading clementine, then at ceiling)}
<D>__{i don't want this. wake me up! stop the procedure! plea }
