<L>__{exterior endicott mountains later that day}
<A>__{the endicott range is full of jagged peaks, icy streams and gnarled tundra valleys. squinting in the glare of the snow, eric and corbett trek through the grandiose gates of the arctic area. the smoldering plane wreckage is a hard won, snow covered mile behind them. intricate patterns of fragmented rock, strips of scruffy tundra and bedrock outcrops produce lonely, foreboding mosaics upon the landscape. the air is still. the silence is itself a disconcerting presence. ten miles ahead and two thousand feet lower, the forest begins. but here, on the rock face of the mountains, eric and corbett might as well be in a desert.}

<D>__{it'll be interesting, trying to build a fire without any wood.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{welcome to the environment, mr. ecology. out here, one mistake is all you get.}
<A>__{determined and dour, eric pushes on.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i don't plan on dying.}
<A>__{it's all academic. the sheer magnitude of the surroundings makes them feel they're the only people in the world.}
