<L>__{interior conference room day}
<A>__{smoky, coffee cups and food. three lawyers, two investment bankers, three commercial bankers, sleeves rolled up, ties askew. a blackboard with bluestar's assets diagrammed. a combat mood in the room. bud walking in, feels vaguely worried, something is not quite right.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{you guys know the new chief of bluestar... bud fox.}
<A>__{they nod vaguely respectful but bud's obviously a figure head to them, takes a seat off to the side. the bull like investment banker, vietnam vet, in shirt and suspenders, is on the attack against the stuffier commercial bankers.}
<C>__{investment banker}
<D>__{look guys, what's the problem, let's for the kill...gekko's got 12% and climbing plus the unions are in his pocket for now, everybody on the street knows the stock's in play}
<P>__{(overlapping voice: up 2 1 4 since the open)}
<D>__{by next week the street's gonna own bluestar and management won't be able to do anything but poison their own pill. why are you guys dicking around? is the bank financing in place or are we gonna have more and more meetings? our firm's gonna guarantee 25% of the total debt structure in long term junk bonds, now you guys either sign this piece of paper right now or we're gonna pull and head for another bank for the 75...}
<C>__{commercial banker}
<P>__{(older man, appeasing)}
<D>__{...look, we have 30 banks ready to participate in a 4 year revolving credit line but we have to have your assurance to pay back most of the loan in the first 6 months, and the only way...}
<C>__{investment banker}
<P>__{(intermittently interrupting)}
<D>__{... 30 banks, isn't that wonderful...you got it, no problem.}
<C>__{commercial banker}
<P>__{(insistent)}
<D>__{...and the only way we can see this happening is liquidating the hangars and the planes. can you people guarantee that?}
<A>__{bud freezes where he sits...it all comes crashing down in a milli second on that word "liquidate" shock now spreading on bud's face...}
<C>__{investment banker}
<D>__{guaranteed! no sweat...we already got the bleezburg brothers lined up to build condos where the hangars are, we can lay off the planes with mexicana, who are dumb enough to buy 'em and texas air is drooling at my kneecaps to get the slots and the routes. what's the problem? it's done..}
<C>__{roger}
<P>__{(passing a paper to the commercial banker)}
<D>__{this is the pricetag on the 737s, the gates, the hangars, the routes, we got it all nailed right down to the typewriters...}
<A>__{bud sits there numbly, a sickening feeling taking hold of him as the camera and music track and trap him tighter and tighter. the lawyers' voices distorting in the background.}
<C>__{investment banker}
<D>__{...'course the beauty of it is the overfunded pension fund. gekko gets the 75 million in there. fifty million buys him the minimum annuities for 6,000 employees and he walks away with the rest. all in, he'll net 60 to 70 million. not bad for a month's work.}
<P>__{(to bud)}
<D>__{your man did his homework, fox, you're gonna have the shortest executive career since the pope who got poisoned...now he'll really start believing he's "gekko the great."}
