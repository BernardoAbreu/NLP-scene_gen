<L>__{interior hunter's ship night}
<A>__{a force field that permeates the jungle, becoming one with the trees and foliage. the hunter walks down a corridor of solid light, leading to an opening to the jungle. as the hunter reaches the doorway he changes from visible to invisible, moving on into the night.}
<L>__{exterior encampment night}
<A>__{the mist has thickened, the night alive with a million jungle sounds. the team members sleep uneasily, if at all. mac, although weary, stares hard into the night, waiting, each small sound a potential enemy. a lull spreads over the jungle, animals and insects quieting. mac tightens his grip on the mini gun. billy awakens, peering into the night. nothing. suddenly, a metallic click, a pop, the sound of a warning flare rocketing into the canopy. a moment later a brilliant flash as the flare burns, illuminating the camp. an echoing eerie scream fills the night as a dark shape in the mist rockets through the undergrowth towards mac. mac spins, hauling the heavy gun around, just as something crashes into his upper body, driving the huge man into the foxhole. a desperate battle for life ensues, illuminated with the strobing light of the descending flare. mac's enraged shouts and roars mingled with horrific screams fill the night. mac's razor edged knife slashes in the light; blood spatters his face as he attacks fiercely. schaefer and ramirez rush at a crouching run towards the foxhole, their weapons ready. a tremendous climatic scream from the foxhole and then, silence. schaefer and ramirez approach, cautiously. mac stands, his face and clothes drenched in blood, some of it his, his breath coming in rapid gasps. he looks at schaefer, whispering hoarsely.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{got the motherfucker...}
<A>__{as the flare breaks through the canopy, dying out in great flickering bursts, the man stare down into the foxhole. a huge, jungle boar lies mutilated in a pool of blood, still quivering in the final throes of death. the flare dies out. mac, shaking from adrenalin, breathing heavily, looks down at the dying animal.}
<C>__{mac}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{a pig...just a fucking pig...}
<A>__{schaefer shines his tekna light onto the boar, playing the light along its massive hulk, its razor edges tusks gleaming in the light. ramirez appears by his side, looking down at the huge carcass.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{holy shit, mac.}
<A>__{nearby, unnoticed by the men, anna stoops, her hands still bound, picking up an mp 5 from the ground. she turns, looking for an avenue of escape, running for the jungle. but the forest looks foreboding and sinister. she stops, staring at the jungle, the moonlight reflected off leaves like a thousand eyes. for a brief second she imagines she can see the hunter's eyes, crashing towards her, the shifting patterns of light and dark making the jungle seem to strobe, like it is about to rush in at her. she freezes, paralyzed by fear, by her memories of the attack. she drops the mp 5 to the ground. back at the foxhole, schaefer and ramirez help the still shaken mac from the hole. schaefer looks at mac, at the huge gash across his chest.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{get a field dressing on that right away.}
<A>__{suddenly he remembers, anna.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{where's the girl?}
<A>__{they all turn, ready to move and then stop. coming forth from the shadows anna appears, still frightened, seeking the security of the soldiers. from the darkness nearby, billy's voice in a hoarse}
<B>__{whisper.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(o.s.; urgently)}
<D>__{major, over here.}
<A>__{schaefer turns, apprehensive, something in billy's voice... he walks over to billy, standing with a flashlight pointing to the ground. they see blain's body bag slashed open, covered in blood. ramirez appears.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{the body...it's gone.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{came in through the trip wires, took it right out from under our noses...}
<A>__{anna appears between schaefer and ramirez, staring down at the empty, blood soaked body bag. she looks up, into schaefer's eyes.}
