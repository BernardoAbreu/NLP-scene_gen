<A>__{landy enters without knocking.}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{since when do you have authorization for lethal action against daniels?}
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{since he cleaned out a blackbriar safe and fled to morocco!}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{so grab him }
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{i don't have the people on the ground to do that and i'm not going to risk that file falling into the wrong hands.}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{what's going on? what's daniels got?}
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{what's he got? he ran all of blackbriar's operations in southern europe and north africa.}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{i think the world's well aware we have a rendition and lethal action capability at this point, noah.}
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{for christ's sake, pam, he's got our entire playbook. names, dates, ghost sites, how we train our assets.....}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{you still don't have the authority to kill him.}
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{oh, yes i do, pam.}
<A>__{vosen holds up the file we saw him pull out of his safe. it is labeled "blackbriar: lethal action protocol."}
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{that's what makes us special. no red tape. no more getting badguys in our sights and then watching them escape while we wait for some bureaucrat to issue the order.}
<A>__{landy opens up the file. sees the words "instantaneous lethal action is authorized when..."}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{you just decide? no oversight. no checks and balances.}
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{come on, pam, you've seen the raw intel. you know how real the threat is. we can't afford to have our hands tied like that anymore.}
