<A>__{vicki has made it to the wall phone. she can't seem to get a dial tone }
<C>__{voice from behind}
<D>__{do you really think we're that stupid?}
<A>__{vicki turns, and realizes to her horror that the voice is selina's.}
<C>__{selina }
<D>__{i tawt i taw a puddy tat...!!}
<A>__{with that she raises a hand and her claws pop out. vicki turns, grabs a carving knife from a wooden block but before she can do anything with it, a whip cracks and wraps around her wrist, jerking the knife loose. selina tugs on the other end, reeling her closer.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{you know, i've got a great recipe for sliced bitch }
<A>__{vicki lunges forward suddenly, causing the whip to slacken and throwing selina off balance into the center island. while they're tangled up, vicki grabs a meat cleaver and tries to bring it down on selina, but selina rolls effortlessly out of the way and returns the favor, swiping at vicki with her claws. vicki brings a calphalon skillet up just in time to block the blow: clang. vicki sweeps her arm across the countertop, showering selina with knives and appliances. it buys her enough time to make for the door but selina comes flying after her. another downswipe with the claws but vicki shoves a butcher's block into selina's path, and her talons wedge a half inch deep in the wood. vicki rushes out while she's trying to pry herself loose.}
