<A>__{fabulous moorish gardens: ponds filled with golden carp; exotic bird cages hang from lemon trees... the distant sounds of victory. santangel and columbus walk through the gardens, escorted by halberdiers. soldiers pass by, carrying coffers or piles of documents. as they approach the inner sanctum, however, there are fewer people. they stop by the lion's fountain, where several dignitaries are waiting patiently for an audience. sanchez appears. they bow. santangel approaches to murmur a compliment.}
