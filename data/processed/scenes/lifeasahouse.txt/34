<L>__{interior hospital room evening}
<A>__{george tries to sit up, but falls back as he closes his eyes, opens his eyes, closes his eyes.}
<C>__{female voice }
<D>__{that took care of the pain?}
<A>__{george opens his eyes again as an attractive nurse enters with a tray of food.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i could kiss you.}
<A>__{the nurse smiles as she lifts the cover off the dinner.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{no food. i'm painless.}
<A>__{she raises george's bed.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{what would you do if you had three or four months to live?}
<A>__{the nurse glances over at the other patient in the room, who's sleeping, before answering in a soft voice.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{i'd eat a lot of red meat.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{good for you.}
<A>__{the nurse smiles as she sits down beside the bed. she fills a spoon with corn and aims it for george's mouth; he accepts the good will, chews and swallows.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{what would you do?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i'd build a house.}
<A>__{george takes another spoonful of food.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{what kind of house?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you know what mortise and tenon is?}
<A>__{the nurse shakes her head "no".}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{i've got every part of it ready. it's like a jig saw puzzle...all in pieces now, just waiting to make sense. i've been through design and review...the planning commission, city council.}
<A>__{she feeds george another small spoonful of food.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{no one's really said four months is all you have, have they?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{stage four pancreatic cancer. they haven't even pretended to offer treatment. you tell me, when would you start eating red meat?}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{can you build a house in four months?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i can die trying.}
<A>__{the nurse rests her hand for a moment on george's cheek.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{good for you.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i haven't been touched in years.}
<A>__{suddenly alarmed by her emotion, the nurse removes her hand and stands back away from george.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i don't know what that was.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{a handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. doctors, people who have to touch you. but not by people who want to.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{no. a friend... your mother? everybody gets touched by someone they love.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{isn't that weird? i mean, i dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years. six years. i know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.}
<A>__{george suddenly stops to catch his emotion. the nurse checks the door before walking back to george; she brushes back his hair with both hands, then fingers the curves of his ears, finally resting her thumbs on his lips.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{oh god, i'm married.}
<A>__{feeling guilty, she flees the room, waking the other patient.}
<C>__{patient}
<D>__{i'm hungry.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i'm touched.}
