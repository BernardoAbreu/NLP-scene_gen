<L>__{exterior gibbons' farm day}
<A>__{brian gibbons jumps off the tractor and sprints down the hill toward the accident. at the edge of the property is a common farm fence made from wooden posts bridged by two thick wires. brian skillfully climbs between the wires and runs past a dead oak tree ten feet inside the fence. in the bg, mr. gibbons darts inside a double wide construction trailer.}
<C>__{mr. gibbons }
<D>__{call 9 1 1!}
<B>__{we follow brian}
<A>__{to the crash site. brian's jaw drops as he absorbs the chilling sight of a guy and a girl dragging a blood soaked man from the back seat to perform cpr on him. around brian, voices mesh in a surreal haze.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{stop it, don't move him!}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{he can't breathe damn it. i think his lung's collapsed!}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{someone call for help!}
<A>__{we steadicam around brian to reveal a woman screaming from the driver's seat. the sound is surreal.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{i can't move my fucking leg! please get me out of here before it explodes!}
<A>__{the color drains from brian's face as the dying man on the ground coughs blood and the girl performing cpr recoils. the moment is still surreal as brian steps back, further away from the horrors he can't face. into the street and rory yanks him back from imminent death as an ambulance speeds onto the property.}
<C>__{rory}
<D>__{watch it, dude!}
<A>__{that snaps brian back to reality. sounds become normal again. brian collects himself and sniffs the air. he then drops to ground level, looking under the expedition for something.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{help us, we need help over here!}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(to kat, reassuringly)}
<D>__{i don't smell any gas. and none's dripping, either.}
<A>__{brian sticks his head in kat's window and peers down at her trapped leg. he swipes the broken glass away from the window with this thick flannel sleeve, reaches in, and tries to yank the door open with all his might. no good, kat screams in pain.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{stop that! i still need this foot, thank you.}
<A>__{brian steps back as the emergency vehicle speeds over.}
