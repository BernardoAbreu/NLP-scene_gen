<L>__{interior the kid's house master bedroom night}
<A>__{facing the camera, willie's in his underpants and santa hat lying on the floor on top of sue. he's gripping her panties with his teeth stretching the elastic while he starts pulling them down. sue's giggling. the bedroom door opens behind them and the kid walks in. he comes up and stands over them, a few steps behind willie. willie freezes, panty elastic waistband still stretched out in his teeth. he senses something, and his eyes look up from under his santa hat, his wolfish smile fades. the kid stands there, hands behind his back.}

<D>__{so i thought i'd give you your present now.}
<A>__{the kid takes his hands from behind his back and extends a small present in crudely taped up wrapping paper. this forces willie to let go of the panties. they snap back. he sits up. he takes the gift and opens it. inside is a roughly whittled crescent of brown wood.}
