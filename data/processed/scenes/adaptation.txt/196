<A>__{the van pulls into the driveway of a neat, middle class house. kaufman and donald drive by, in time to see orlean and laroche emerge from the van. orlean seems different now: more exotic. she's wearing some kind of sexy sarong. donald drives up the street, parks, gets out of the car, and watches as laroche lugs orlean's suitcase into the house.}

<A>__{kaufman gets out of the car. donald gets in, peruses kaufman's script. kaufman walks past the house, trying to peer in windows. he sees nothing. he slinks around back. in the yard, kaufman finds a greenhouse. it's filled with row upon row of ghost orchids.}
