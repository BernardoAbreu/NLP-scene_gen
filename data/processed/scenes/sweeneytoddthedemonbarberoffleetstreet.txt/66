<L>__{interior bakehouse steps dusk}
<A>__{...music continues as mrs. lovett descends a long and very claustrophobic series of steps down to the bakehouse. she unbolts and pulls aside a heavy iron door and enters. we remain outside. a fiery red glow spills out the roar of the oven within is thundering.}
<L>__{exterior fleet street dusk}
<A>__{...the beggar woman stands on fleet street. the hellish metropolis glows, the smoke from a thousand chimneys creating a great pall over the city.}
<C>__{beggar woman}
<P>__{(in a demented rage)}
<D>__{smoke! smoke! sign of the devil! sign of the devil! city on fire!}
<P>__{(to disgusted passers by)}
<D>__{witch! witch! smell it, sir! an evil smell! every night at the vespers bell smoke that comes from the mouth of hell city on fire! city on fire...}
<P>__{(she begins to scuttle off)}
<D>__{mischief! mischief! mischief...}
