<A>__{alex glides to a stop even as her wrist display starts to beep. this time a wooden doorway is standing directly in front of her, the golden key sticking out of the lock. as alex reaches for it, the screamer enters level four. alex slowly opens the door.}
<C>__{albert's voice }
<D>__{you can get a free life on level four, but you have to wait for the last possible instant...}
<A>__{alex turns and waits calmly for the screamer.}
<B>__{the screamer}
<A>__{is a black speck on the horizon, then a bullet, then a nightmarish face bearing down on her... it's jaws flare open to engulf her. alex doesn't flinch at all. and at the last possible second before impact... blink! a stylized figure appears on her wrist display next to the "time elapsed" meter. beneath the figure it says "free life". alex feels the breath of the screamer on her face and falls back through the doorway... "level six shock corridor"}
