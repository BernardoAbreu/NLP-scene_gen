<L>__{exterior airstrip day}
<A>__{the corvette, pulling behind the still lowered rear ramp of the transport plane! clay, onto the corvette's hood... roque, rising to meet him. waiting for him... clay jumps! landing on the ramp! in the cargo hold roque smiles. pulls a wicked looking knife. the two men stand there. sizing one another up...}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{gotta admit, i always wondered how this would play out.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{aisha thinks you kill me.}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{it's a distinct possibility...}
<A>__{they begin circling one another. clay, still weaponless.}
<C>__{roque }
<D>__{you don't have a knife?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{don't need one.}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{bit of as longshot for you...}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{no. it's not.}
<A>__{roque lunges at him... but clay does have a knife. he pulls it and slams it into roque's belly! roque, stunned! staggers back... for most men, that would be the end of the fight. but not these two. roque gives clay a bloody grin.}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{now i really am gonna cut your head off...}
<A>__{he lunges again! and now it is fully on... the blades whip up and down almost too fast to see roque gets clay with a left cross, then buries his knife in clay's shoulder. clay twists free, slashes at roque. ten seconds in, the men separate again. breathing hard... clay sees roque doesn't have his knife. looks realizing it's still embedded in his own shoulder. pulls it out, tosses it back to roque. they stand there, both panting... then run at each other full tilt! here's how it ends. and pay attention, it happens fast: clay goes low coming up to grab roque's knife hand, which is arcing downwards towards clay's throat clay manages to halt the hand, blade inches from his adam's apple and there's a moment where roque could overpower him and actually cut his head off... but clay throws his weight forward and breaks roque's right arm! and for the first time, roque screams. which seems to make clay happy. so he breaks roque's left arm too. roque falls to his knees, broken, bloody, and beaten... to reveal the pilot. leaning out of the cockpit, desert eagle levelled at clay.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{shit }
<A>__{the pilot pulls the trigger. the bullet slams into clay's abdomen and blows him off his feet backwards flying out of the plane and landing on hood of}
<C>__{the corvette}
<A>__{clay smashes down on the windshield cougar pumps the brakes and spins the wheel desperately trying to keep clay from rolling off the hood...}
<C>__{the plane}
<A>__{turning around at the end of the runway. beginning it's final run to get up to speed...}
<C>__{the corvette}
<A>__{now driving towards it on a chicken like collision course when whoosh! wade flies past on his motorcycle! clay turns to cougar through the spiderwebbed windshield:}
<C>__{clay }
<D>__{rifle...}
<A>__{cougar passes clay his sniper rifle and floors it... visualize this at one end of the runway, the plane starting to take off. at the opposite end, wade's motorcycle heading full speed at the approaching plane. cougar and clay, chasing wade. and then aisha steps out into the middle of the runway. the rocket launcher clutched in her hands. she takes a knee. aims at the plane, which is almost at lift speed. roque sees her from the cockpit. she locks eyes with him and grins firing into the landing gear of the plane as...}
<C>__{the corvette}
<A>__{pulls even with wade. instead of shooting, clay throws cougar's rifle between the spokes of wade's front tire, causing the bike to catapult wade off and forward... ...through the air and into the right number two jet engine of the now flying cargo plane. the engine explodes. aisha, somehow safe on the ground, looking up at the escaping plane. clay looking up. all of them watching... ...as roque dies very badly. whoomp! the big plane explodes in a monster fireball va dooom! burning gas and iron and cash. fire rules.}
<B>__{on the ground}
<A>__{our guys. bloody, eyes bitterly triumphant. clay stares at the sight before him. only one word for it.}
<C>__{clay }
<D>__{outstanding.}
<A>__{jensen approaches, supporting pooch.}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{not to rain on everyone's we killed all the bad guys parade, but we should probably get gone legless pooch has a learjet all gassed up for us in the hangar.}
<P>__{(off pooch's look)}
<D>__{it's a cool name }
<A>__{from the smashed up bike wade was driving, wade's cell phone rings. clay gets off the hood of the vette and cougar and aisha help him hobble over. answering it:}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{hello?}
