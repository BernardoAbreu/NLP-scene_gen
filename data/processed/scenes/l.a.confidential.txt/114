<L>__{interior 1736 nottingham (lynn bracken's) bedroom night}
<A>__{spent, bud and lynn lie in bed. she traces a finger over his bicep as he muses on the ceiling.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{who was that guy who was here earlier?}
<A>__{lynn's tracing finger stops on bud's shoulder a small white scar.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{it doesn't matter. all they get is veronica lake. you got the real lynn margaret bracken...}
<P>__{(re: scar)}
<D>__{where'd this come from?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{when i was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother. i guess i got in the way.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{so you saved her.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{yeah. but not for long.}
<A>__{bud looks away. lynn sees he doesn't want to talk about it.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{do you like being a cop, bud?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i used to. what i do now is strong arm. sitting duck stuff... no, i don't like it. if i could work homicide like a real detective...}
<A>__{lynn listens sympathetically. bud's opening up.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{there's something wrong with the nite owl. that prick exley shot the wrong guys. but they made him a hero and whoever killed my partner is still out there.}
<A>__{frustrated, bud pokes at his own chest.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{in here i know it. but i can't prove it. i'm not a detective. i'm not smart enough. i'm just the guy they bring in to scare the other guy shitless.}
<A>__{bud looks away, embarrassed to have shown so much of himself. lynn reaches over, turns his face back to her.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{you found patchett. you found me. you're smart enough. be a detective if that's what you want.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{that simple, huh?}
<A>__{lynn nods. that simple.}
