<D>__{neither of us did.}
<A>__{ali looks at her a moment. then he leaves. silence. belinda sits on the bed. she looks up. then she comes apart. she rips open a closet. she finds veronica's clothes, rips them, shreds peignoirs, overturns a night table, strips the bed, smashes more furniture, throws veronica's suitcase at the mirror. it does not break. she looks around the wrecked room. bingham is standing there.}
