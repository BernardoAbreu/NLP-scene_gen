<L>__{interior a sleepy diner late afternoon}
<A>__{located across the street from hooker's apartment building. hooker sits down alone in a booth, with a plate of ham and eggs he's hardly touched. the two cuts on his face have pretty much stopped bleeding. a big fan above the counter area drones away lethargically, it's air stream insufficient to either cool the place or drive out the smell of onions and grease. a waitress, loretta, emerges from the kitchen and ambles slowly over to hooker's table. slim and raven haired, she manifests an indifference bred from years spent delivering things to people who are rarely grateful for what she brings. only a light scar on her left cheek hints at another side.}
