<A>__{we hear deafening applause as we hold on andre and jamal williams, two huge bodyguards, dressed in identical black suits. suddenly, the artist formerly known as prince comes off stage, grabs a towel from an assistant and starts walking with jamal in front and andre in the rear. as they walk, a cell phone rings. andre pulls it from his pocket and answers it, quietly. jamal runs interference with the techies and groupies backstage.}

<D>__{don't look at him! he don't like being looked at, god damn it! no eye contact!}
<A>__{as they walk, andre is still talking on the phone. finally, they get to the backstage door and stop. the rock star prepares to run the gauntlet of adoring fans behind his trusty bodyguards. but his bodyguards are conversing quietly but urgently with each other. one of the assistants throws open the door. a big mob waits outside. the anointed one turns to his bodyguards to lead the way, but... they're gone! the mob surges. the artist formerly known as prince screams as he's trampled to death by his fans.}
