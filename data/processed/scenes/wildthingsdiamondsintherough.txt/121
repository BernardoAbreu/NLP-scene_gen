<A>__{stands in the shattered doorway, surveys the expansive, unfinished floor. is about to unleash a hail of bullets when... the work lights flicker out, replaced by the eerie ultra violet lights scattered around the unfinished floor...bathed in the florescent blue glow of the lights, elena scrambles to safety behind a pillar. her shirt glows, her eyes like beacons...}

<B>__{morrison}
<A>__{runs up the fire escape stairs when a final deafening gun shot rings out. followed by screams. he rips open the fourth floor fire door, tearing through the building, pushing through thick plastic sheeting until he finds himself under the uv glow. thick plumes of blood, black under the uv light, stain the walls and floor. he sees elena, in a fetal ball, trembling uncontrollably. beside her, marie lies dead, her chest a gaping crimson mess, jay's gun still clutched tightly in her cold, dead hands. kristen looks up at him, almost too shocked to speak. morrison's shotgun is still smoking in her hands.}
