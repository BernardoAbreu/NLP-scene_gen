<D>__{susan lies on the floor with her neck shoddily stitched and a splint on her shoulder made out of a few sticks and some dirty bandages. she moans in pain and mumbles curses.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i hate you... i hate you... she tries to stand, but the doctor impedes it.}
<C>__{doctor}
<P>__{(to anwar in arabic)}
<D>__{tell her not to move; the bullet's still inside.}
<C>__{anwar}
<P>__{(to susan)}
<D>__{don't move, miss. the bullet is still inside you.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i don't give a shit...}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{my love, don't move.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i want to call the kids.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{you can't move, calm down.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i want to talk to them.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{you can't; there's only one phone in town. i will call them later. she seems obsessed by the idea.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i want to talk to them... she tries to stand again. as they struggle, the grandmother takes out a hash pipe form a drawer and lights it. she gives it two drags and squats next to susan. she shows her how to smoke it and hands it over. the old woman's serenity is such that susan acquiesces. she takes four drags and slowly starts to relax. susan smokes another three times, relaxes and closes her eyes. the old woman goes to get the clump of mud and starts to spread it on susan's neck. susan does not protest. richard watches the scene in awe.}
