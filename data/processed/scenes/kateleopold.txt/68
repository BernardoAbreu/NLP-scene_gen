<A>__{leopold asleep on the sofa still clutching the remote control. kate comes in with a blanket and settles it over leopold. she glances around the room, then slowly bends down close to capture a better look at his face. after a moment she catches herself, takes herself in hand and sits down at her computer. she opens her notes and types. her fingers slow down to a crawl and come to a stop. she looks up at leopold lost in thought. she smiles. reaching for a soda, she accidentally knocks a picture to the floor. in a smashed frame, kate and carlson drunkenly mug for the camera. kate pales noticeably. she looks from the picture to leopold. slowly, she begins pecking away at the keys. she does not look up again.}
