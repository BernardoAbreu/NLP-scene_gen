<L>__{exterior union station parking lot bus stop day 12:19pm}
<A>__{...a large crowd of tourists, that have just exited an arriving mini bus. gene is caught up in the crowd and carried along like a leaf in a stream. amid the chattering crowd, gene is pushed along as if in a trance. he touches the pocket with the gun. he looks at the bullets in his hand, then at the people around him. it's like a splash of cold water. he quickly pockets the bullets, turns and pushes against the tide of tourists. they resist him, pushing him along until he breaks free and can see... the van is gone! angle on gene 12:19pm he stands there, a lost man. fear sweeps over him. he looks desperately around. he is within himself, oblivious to his surroundings, his mind racing, his face a tangle of emotions. he is a man alone in a crowd. he takes a step. a little latino girl, chased by her brother, runs into gene's legs. he instinctively grabs her before she can fall, finds himself, crouched down, holding her by the arms. his heart plunges she isn't lynn. his intensity scares her.}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{mama!}
<A>__{she pulls away, flees to her mother, who hoists her up, reprimanding her in spanish. gene stays crouched, watching the little girl staring at him over her mother's shoulder. until a cop crosses his line of sight. a los angeles transit policeman, foot patrolling the station. it's like a gift from above. relief floods gene's face. he is saved. he stands, hurries toward the cop, each step more confident. then, just beyond the cop, mr. smith casually slides into view, pointedly holding the walkie talkie. gene walks right past the cop heading towards a cab stand. mr. smith falls in behind him speaking in his ear.}
