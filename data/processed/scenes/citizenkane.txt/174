<A>__{the camera is just inside the curtain, angling upstage. we see the set for "thais" the principals in place stage managers, stage hands, etc., and in the center of all this, in an elaborate costume, looking very small and very lost, is susan. she is almost hysterical with fright. maids, singing teacher, and the rest are in attendance. her throat is sprayed. applause is heard at the opening of the shot, and now the orchestra starts thunderously. the curtain starts to rise the camera with it the blinding glare of the foots moves up susan's body and hits her face. she squints and starts to sing. camera continues on up with the curtain, up past susan, up the full height of the proscenium arch and then on up into the gridiron into a world of ropes, brick walls and hanging canvas susan's voice still heard but faintly. the camera stops at the top of the gridiron as the curtain stops. two typical stage hands fill the frame. they are looking down on the stage below. some of the reflected light gleams on their faces. they look at each other. one of them puts his hand to his nose.}
