<T>__{the szpilmans:}
<A>__{szpilman turns away and leads the others to another space. later: glaring sun. the szpilmans have settled down on the kerb of a pavement and are waiting. szpilman stands, observing the scene. mother sits on a bundle of things, staring vacantly, her hair hanging down in strands. regina, beside her, has her hands over her face and is weeping, the tears running through her fingers. father walks nervously up and down, hands behind his back, four steps one way, four steps back. near them, a young woman begins to wail.}
<C>__{the young woman}
<D>__{why did i do it? why did i do it?}
<A>__{a young man, beside her, whispers to her, but she does not seem to take in what he's saying. her cries continue at intervals.}
<C>__{the young woman}
<D>__{why did i do it? why did i do it?}
<A>__{the sound of trucks. everyone looks towards the gates. more jews are being unloaded from trucks and are marched through the gates. mothers, children, old people, begging, most of them holding papers. pandemonium. later: the sun high, blazing. szpilman is wandering around, occasionally greeting people. the place is crowded now, packed. trucks bring more and more jews at intervals. old people lying down, exhausted, impossible to tell whether some of them are alive or dead. women carrying dehydrated children drag themselves from group to group. one woman approaches szpilman.}
<C>__{woman with child}
<D>__{he's dying, don't you have a drop of water? my child's dying of thirst, he's dying, he's dying, i beg you!}
<A>__{szpilman shakes his head sadly. the woman with child wanders off to another group.}
<C>__{a man's voice}
<D>__{i'm telling you, it's a disgrace.}
<A>__{szpilman turns to see a man, dr. ehrlich, haranguing father.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{i can hear you.}
<A>__{szpilman goes to them.}
<C>__{dr. ehrlich}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{we're letting them take us to our death like sheep to the slaughter!}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{dr. ehrlich, not so loud!}
<C>__{dr. ehrlich}
<D>__{why don't we attack them? there's half a million of us, we could break out of the ghetto. at least we could die honourably, not as a stain on the face of history!}
<A>__{another man, grun, joins in.}
<C>__{grun}
<D>__{why you so sure they're sending us to our death?}
<C>__{dr. ehrlich}
<D>__{i'm not sure. you know why i'm not sure? because they didn't tell me. but i'm telling you they plan to wipe us all out!}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{dr. ehrlich, what do you want me to do? you want me to fight?}
<C>__{grun}
<D>__{to fight you need organisation, plans, guns!}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{he's right. what d'you think i can do? fight them with my violin bow?}
<C>__{grun}
<D>__{the germans would never squander a huge labour force like this. they're sending us to a labour camp.}
<C>__{dr. ehrlich}
<D>__{oh, sure. look at that cripple, look at those old people, the children, they're going to work? look at mr szpilman here, he's going to carry iron girders on his back?}
<A>__{a loud cry from mother. szpilman and father spin round.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{henryk!}
<C>__{regina}
<P>__{(glancing up, shocked)}
<D>__{oh my god!}
<A>__{near the gates, among a large bunch of new arrivals, henryk and halina.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{halina! henryk!}
<A>__{regina and szpilman also call and wave. henryk and halina struggle through to them. halina falls into mother's arms and they hug.}
<C>__{halina}
<D>__{we heard you were here...we...didn't want...we...we wanted to be with you.}
<A>__{mother comforts her. and so does regina. father smiles sadly.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<P>__{(shakes his head,}
<D>__{almost to himself,}
<P>__{a forlorn smile)}
<D>__{stupid, stupid!}
<C>__{the young woman}
<D>__{why did i do it? why did i do it?}
<A>__{szpilman stands and stares at her. later: the sun lower but the heat still intense. the place is now packed to suffocation. people calling out names, trying to find each other. the wailing of women and the cries of children. a cordon of jewish policemen and ss guards are, almost surreptitiously, ringing the compound. the szpilmans sit in the same place, with henryk sitting a little apart and now reading a small book.}
<C>__{the young woman}
<D>__{why did i do it? why did i do it?}
<C>__{halina}
<D>__{she's getting on my nerves. what did she do, for god's sake?}
<A>__{grun leans across to her.}
<C>__{grun}
<P>__{(quietly, to halina)}
<D>__{she smothered her baby.}
<A>__{halina looks at him in disbelief.}
<C>__{grun}
<D>__{they'd prepared a hiding place and so, of course, they went there. but the baby cried just as the police came. she smothered the cries with her hands. the baby died. a policeman heard the death rattle. he found where they were hiding.}
<A>__{later: szpilman and henryk.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{what are you reading?}
<C>__{henryk}
<P>__{(a crooked, ironic smile)}
<D>__{'if you prick us, do we not bleed? if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'}
<A>__{szpilman takes the book and reads the title page:}
<B>__{the merchant of venice by william shakespeare.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{very appropriate.}
<C>__{henryk}
<P>__{(taking the book}
<D>__{back and resuming}
<P>__{his reading)}
<D>__{yes, that's why i brought it.}
<A>__{later: the szpilmans seated on the kerb. their attention is caught by a boy who has a box of sweets on a string round his neck. and he's setting the sweets, pocketing money.}
<C>__{henryk}
<D>__{idiot. what's he think he's going to do with the money?}
<A>__{father calls to the sweet boy and beckons him over.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{how much for a caramel?}
<C>__{the sweet boy}
<D>__{twenty zlotys.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{what? for one caramel? what d'you think you're going to do with the money?}
<C>__{the sweet boy}
<D>__{twenty zlotys.}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(turning to the family)}
<D>__{have we got twenty between us?}
<A>__{they search their pockets and handbags, hand over to father what change they can find. he, in turn, hands the money to the sweet boy, who hands over one caramel and goes on his way. father holds the caramel between thumb and forefinger and examines it carefully. then, carefully takes out his penknife and with great care divides the caramel into six pans. he hands a part to each of the family. they all exchange a look, an acknowledgement of each other, almost like a toast, and then they chew, slowly, deliberately. the whistle of a locomotive. sound of trucks rattling over the rails. at once, a sound of great agitation from the jews in the compound.}
