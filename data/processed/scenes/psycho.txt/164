<L>__{interior downstairs hallway of old house (day)}
<A>__{lila closes the door, remains by it for a moment, quiet, listening. her eyes scan the layout, the closed door which leads off the hallway, to the dining room on the right and the parlor on the left. down at the end of the hall is the kitchen, the door wide open, the room beyond dim and silent. she notices the stairs leading down to the basement, stares at them, then back to the stairs leading to the second floor. she starts forward, and seems about to investigate the parlor and dining room.}
