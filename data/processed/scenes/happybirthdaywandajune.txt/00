<A>__{silence. pitch blackness. animal eyes begin to glow in the darkness. sounds of the jungle climax in animals fighting. a singer is heard singing the first bars of "all god's chillun got shoes." harold, looseleaf, penelope, and woodly stand in a row in the darkness, facing the audience. they are motionless. a city skyline in the early evening materializes outside the windows. the lights come up on the living room of a rich man's apartment, which is densely furnished with trophies of hunts and wars. there is a front door, a door to the master bedroom suite, and a corridor leading to other bedrooms, the kitchen and so on.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{how do you do. my name is penelope ryan. this is a simple minded play about men who enjoy killing and those who don't.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{i am harold ryan, her husband. i have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts as a professional soldier. i have killed thousands of other animals as well for sport.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{i am dr. norbert woodly a physician, a healer. i find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society. gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.}

<P>__{(to looseleaf)}
<D>__{would you like to say something about killing, colonel?}
<C>__{looseleaf}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}

<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{colonel harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on nagasaki during the second world war, killing seventy four thousand people in a flash.}

<P>__{(hyena laughs)}
<D>__{my husband, who kills so much, has been missing for eight years. he disappeared in a light plane over the amazon rain forest, where he hoped to find diamonds as big as cantaloupes. his pilot was colonel looseleaf harper, who dropped the bomb on nagasaki.}
<P>__{(hyena laughs)}
<D>__{i should explain the doorbells in this apartment. they were built by abercrombie and fitch. they are actual recordings of animal cries. the back doorbell is a hyena, which you've just heard. the front doorbell is a lion's roar.}

<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{most men shunned me even when i nearly swooned for want of love. i might as well have been girdled in a chastity belt. my chastity belt was not made of iron and chains and chickenwire, but of harold's lethal reputation.}

<D>__{i keep having this nightmare that he catches us.}

<D>__{he'd assume we had.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{that's something i suppose.}
<C>__{shuttle}
<D>__{all through the day i'm so confident. that's why i'm such a good salesman, you know? i have confidence, and i look like i have confidence, and that gives other people confidence. people laugh sometimes when they find out i'm a vacuum cleaner salesman. they stop laughing, though, when they find out i made forty three thousand dollars last year. i've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence. that's what charges them up.}

<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{i'm touched.}
<C>__{shuttle}
<D>__{that's when i will get my confidence back.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{i see.}

<D>__{which we do. but we can stop doing that.}

<D>__{that harold ryan he says he spoke to me in perfect german? he talks german like my ass chews gum. i'm glad to hear the wonderful thing he said before he killed me. i sure didn't understand it the first time around. i figured he was a lithuanian or something, which will give you an idea of how wrong you can be. all i knew was he was very proud about something, and he had a machine pistol, and it was aimed at me. the woods were full of all kinds of nuts who were proud of some damn thing or other, and they all had guns. they were always looking for revenge. you find a way to bottle revenge that's the end of schnapps und coca cola.}

<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{it's complicated and i don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted. it's just the truth.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{i like the truth. i wouldn't be alive today if i weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{well part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{penelope}
<P>__{(blurting)}

<D>__{if what?}
<C>__{looseleaf}
<D>__{if i hadn't done it. if i'd said to myself, "screw it. i'm going to let all those people down there live."}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{they were enemies. we were at war.}
<C>__{looseleaf}
<D>__{yeah, jesus but wars would be a lot better, i think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "jesus i'm not going to do that to the enemy. that's too much." you could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up. i could have been the father of all those people in nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i sent 'em to heaven instead and i don't think there is one.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{goodbye, looseleaf.}
<A>__{looseleaf walks around and gathers his things.}
<C>__{looseleaf}
<D>__{so long, you guys.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{what will you do, colonel?}
<C>__{looseleaf}
<D>__{i dunno. marry the first whore who's nice to me, i guess. get a job in a motorcycle shop. so long, you guys.}
<A>__{penelope kisses looseleaf. everybody but harold acknowledges his departure is some way. harold turns his back. looseleaf exits, closes door. silence.}

<P>__{(blackly, tautly)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{shuttle}
<D>__{we got to get another pilot.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{shuttle}
<D>__{for africa.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{do you really think that harold ryan would go to africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?}
<C>__{shuttle}
<D>__{you invited me.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{to make an ass of yourself.}
<C>__{shuttle}
<D>__{what went wrong?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{we're ahead of schedule, that's all. you're finding out here what you would have found out in africa that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.}
<C>__{shuttle}
<D>__{gee whiz }
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{it would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.}
<C>__{shuttle}
<D>__{i wouldn't drop my gun.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{you're hollow, like a woman.}
<C>__{shuttle}
<D>__{i'm smarter than looseleaf.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{he can shoot! he can hold his ground! he can attack! you're in your proper profession right now sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.}
<C>__{shuttle}
<P>__{(close to tears)}

<C>__{harold}
<D>__{look how you're acting now! this is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying. slug me!}

<C>__{harold}
<D>__{thank god!}
<A>__{he propels shuttle out the door and slams it. he faces penelope and paul, speaks with malicious calm.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{well what have we here? a family.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{almost a christmas scene.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{just one favor.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{money? there's plenty of that. mildred got the brewery. you'll probably get the baseball team.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{i want you to tell me that you loved me once.}
<A>__{harold is about to dismiss this request majestically, but penelope cuts him off with a sharp, dangerous warning.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{i mean it! i must have that, and so must paul. tell him that he was conceived in love, even though you hate me now. tell both of us that somewhere is our lives was love.}
<A>__{harold experiments inwardly with responses of various kinds, obviously saying them to himself, directing himself with his hands. nothing quite satisfies him.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{testimonials of that sort are are beyond my range. i don't do them well.}
<P>__{(sincerely, not liking to fail in any way)}
<D>__{that's a failing, i know.}
<C>__{penelope}
<P>__{(accepting this ruefully)}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i don't care. i don't care if there was love or not. that's all right. i'm going to go to my room and close the door. i don't want to hear any more.}

<C>__{harold}
<D>__{see how you've upset him. he was so merry and hale before you came home.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{how unhappy he's going to be alone in his room.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{he'll play with his rifle, i expect. that will cheer him up.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{rifle?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{i bought him a twenty two yesterday on the way home from hamburger heaven. and where is the good doctor? have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{he's in east st. louis with his mother visiting an aunt.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{last i heard, his mother was going alone.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{he's afraid of you, harold. he knew you'd want to fight him. he doesn't know anything about fighting. he hates pain.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{and you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{it seems highly intelligent to me.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{what kind of a country has this become? the men wear beads and refuse to fight and the woman adore them. america's days of greatness are over. it has drunk the blue soup.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{blue soup?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{an indian narcotic we were forced to drink. it put us in a haze a honey colored haze which was lavender around the edge. we laughed, we sang, we snoozed. when a bird called, we answered back. every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried. we had a funeral that went on for five days for the cockroach! i sang "oh promise me." can you imagine? where the hell did i ever learn the words to "oh promise me"? looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a b 36. all the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup! never stopped drinking blue soup. blue soup all the time. we'd go out after food in that honey colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{sounds quite beautiful.}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(angered)}
<D>__{beautiful, you say? it wasn't life, it wasn't death it wasn't anything!}
<P>__{(anger still mounting)}
<D>__{beautiful? seven years gone }

<D>__{like that, like that! seven years of silliness and random dreams! seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(becoming dangerously}
<D>__{physical, seizing a}

<C>__{harold}
<D>__{what's this?}
<A>__{paul wilts instantly, attempts to make his rifle inconspicuous, harmless, meaningless.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{that's a rifle you have?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{of course it is. is it loaded?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{open the bolt!}
<A>__{paul obeys. a cartridge pops out.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{that's a cartridge, if i'm not mistaken. gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap all set to go.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i was cleaning it.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber where it belongs.}
<C>__{paul}

<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{you're begging him to kill you?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{if he thinks he's man enough.}
<C>__{penelope}
<P>__{(amazed by sudden insight)}
<D>__{that's really what you want. you become furious when people won't make you dead.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{i'm teaching my son to be a man.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{so he can kill you. you hate your own life that much. you beg for a hero to kill you.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{i plan to live one hundred years!}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{no you don't.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{if that's the case what's to prevent my killing myself?}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{honor, i suppose.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{what a handsome word.}
<C>__{penelope}
<P>__{(wonderingly)}
<D>__{but it's all balled up in your head with death. the highest honor is death. when you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them. you honored them with death. harold it is not honor to be killed.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{if you've lived a good life, fought well }
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{it's still just death, the absence of life no honor at all. it's worse than the blue soup by far that nothingness. to you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{may i continue with the rearing of my son?}
<P>__{(to paul)}
<D>__{load that gun!}

<P>__{(throwing up his hands)}

<P>__{(including the}
<D>__{audience, inviting it}
<P>__{to share his indignation)}
<D>__{there are guest issues to be fought out here or to be argued, at least. the enemy, the champion of all who oppose me, is in east st. louis with his mother and his aunt! i have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a violin.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{the old heroes are going to have to get used to this, harold the new heroes who refuse to fight. they're trying to save the planet. there's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{i feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. we don't have to fight with steel. i can fight with words. i'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary. call him up in east st. louis, penelope. tell him to come here.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(emptily, turning away)}
<D>__{no.}

<P>__{(indicating penelope)}
<D>__{you don't know her, either. i don't think you know anybody. you talk to everybody just the same.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{i'm talking to you gently now.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah. but it's going to get loud again.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{he's right, harold. to you, we're simply pieces in a game this one labeled "woman," that one labeled "son." there is no piece labeled "enemy" and you are confused.}
<A>__{lion doorbell roars. paul goes to answer it.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{there won't be anybody out there. that's the new style: nobody anywhere.}

<D>__{oh look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{it died for your sins.}

<P>__{(frighteningly)}
<D>__{don't!}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{i agree.}
<A>__{woodly closes the door. penelope backs away from the phone, drifts toward paul, who still holds his rifle.}

<D>__{this is man to man.}

<D>__{it's healer to killer. is that the same thing?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{what brought you back?}
<C>__{woodly}

<D>__{am i correct?}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{i can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers. but he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish harold ryan with words. the truth! correct?}

<D>__{correct.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{what an hallucination!}
<P>__{(laughs)}

<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{we'll find out now, won't we?}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{no, we won't. no matter how it begins, it will end in death. because it always does. isn't that always how it ends, harold in death?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{there has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort. these elements are lacking.}

<D>__{a living fossil! like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{we do survive, don't we? you're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. that's a matter of form not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard. no rush about that. just remember to apologize sometime soon.}
<A>__{penelope takes the rifle from paul.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{you're a son of a bitch.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{yes well uh that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology. whenever you feel like it. it's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. your apology turns off the alarm.}

<P>__{(leveling the gun)}
<D>__{i'm turning off the alarm. i'm turning off everything.}

<D>__{you can never take yourself seriously again! look at all the creatures you've protected us from! did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(blankly, as though in a dream)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{the magic root you gave me i had it analyzed. it was discovered by a harvard botanist in 1893! he explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(blankly)}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{you aren't going to hurt me. you aren't going to hurt anybody any more. any violent gesture will seem ridiculous to yourself!}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{don quixote.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{my violin is avenged!}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{something seems to have happened to my self respect.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{and the hell with it. it was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{the new hero is you.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{i hate crowds, and i have no charisma }
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{you're too modest.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{but the new hero will be a man of science and of peace like me. he'll disarm you, of course. no more guns, no more guns.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{was i ever of use?}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{never. for when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.}
<A>__{harold picks up the rifle, considers it, offers it to woodly.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{here. finish the job.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{i'm utterly satisfied.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{you're making a mistake. obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded. you've wounded me.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{more clowning! don't you see?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{we never quit fighting until we're dead.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{you'd be killing a friend. don't you know how much i like you?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{i'm going to shoot you now.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{my self respect is gone and my soldier's honor with it. it is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{new dignity can be yours as a merciful man. you can change!}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{like the saber toothed tiger.}
<C>__{woodly}
<P>__{(sickened)}
<D>__{oh god you're really going to kill me.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{it won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee. heaven is very much like paradise, they say. you'll like it there.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{can i beg for mercy on my knees?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{if you want to be found that way.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{what is this thing that kills me?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{man, as man was meant to be a vengeful ape who murders. he will soon be extinct. it's time, it's time.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{don't shoot.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{i've enjoyed being man.}
<A>__{he aims the rifle tentatively.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(goes down on his knees)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{get up.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{have it your way. we'd both be better off dead now.}
<A>__{harold begins to squeeze the trigger, falters, lowers the rifle.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{can't do it.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{thank god.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{crawl home.}
<A>__{he turns his back on woodly, who stands shakily.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{thank you for my life.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{it's trash now, like mine.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{new lives begin!}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{somewhere in this city. not here, not here. tell penelope i loved her in my clownish way. and paul. tell him to be a healer, by all means.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{what are you going to do?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{use the sanitary facilities, if i may.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{leave the rifle here.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{i will put it in paul's room, where it belongs.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{for what it's worth now, harold ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.}
<A>__{harold exits into corridor. woodly looks after him helplessly, apprehensively. silence.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{harold?}
<A>__{von konigswald, mildred, and wanda june enter from the side stealthily. von konigswald, pantomimes that his companions are to be quiet and to listen for something wonderful. all ghosts cup their hands to their ears.}
<C>__{woodly}
<D>__{harold?}
<A>__{there is a shot offstage. von konigswald is delighted. mildred is sickened. wanda june is dazed. woodly collapses in grief. harold enters from the corridor, shaking his head.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{i missed.}
<A>__{von konigswald expresses disappointment. mildred covers her face. wanda june sucks her thumb.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{the end.}
<A>__{curtain.}
