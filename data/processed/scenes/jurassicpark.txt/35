<L>__{ext park road night}
<A>__{nedry's red jeep flies down the park road. close on nedry's wheel as he turns it. his tires skid sideways, then regain traction. the jeep bolts up a smaller access road. he skids to a stop at the top of the hill. nedry jumps out and looks up. his high beams illuminate a huge electric fence prominently labeled: danger! 10,000 volts! two safety fences separate nedry from the electric fence. he races to the first one, pulls out a key chain. he tries one key, then another, and another. it f its. nedry unlocks the gate, swings open the door. nedry runs to the second gate. he slips in the mud. he slides to the ground, dropping keys in a muddy pool. close on nedry's hand frantically fishing for the key chain in the muddy water. got them! unlocks the second gate. he races to the electric fence. rain pelts him now. water beads on his face. lightning flashes on the 10,000 volts warning. he grabs the gate with his bare hand and swings it open. nedry heads back to his jeep, his fat body strobed by its high beams. he jumps in the jeep and drives through. behind him, the open gates move recklessly in the stormy night.}
