<P>__{(finishing up with a customer)}
<D>__{i remember you told me you were scottish, but do you really like haggis.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no. i think it's repellent in every way. in fact, i think most scottish cuisine is based on a dare.}

<C>__{harriet}
<P>__{(to the next customer)}

<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i will check.}

<C>__{customer}
<D>__{my parents are coming to town. you know how parents are. they'll drive you nuts.}
<A>__{the eskimo exits, there are no customers left.}

<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{trying to be a vegetarian?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah, the problem is i really love hot dogs.}
<C>__{harriet}

<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you could take me to a nice romantic dinner.}
