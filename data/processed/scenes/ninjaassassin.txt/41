<L>__{interior istanbul raizo's apartment day}
<A>__{raizo sits alone. crossed legged on the floor. utterly still. there's an ocean of sound swirling around him. the cacophony of instanbul evening rush hour. raizo starts to build a dam; auricular sandbags laid one by one, walling off the outside world. the traffic outside horns, engines, squealing tires, rattling trucks chassis all fade away. people shouting, singing. a couple next door making love. a baby wailing. jackhammers pounding... slowly, the world fades away, until there is only one sound. faint, familiar, but almost too quiet to hear... raizo's heartbeat. he listens to it. meditates on its simple rhythm... until a sound explodes in the room, it is a sound we haven't heard in his apartment a phone. he rises slowly as the phone continues to ring. he answers it silently waiting for something the line clicks and goes dead.}
