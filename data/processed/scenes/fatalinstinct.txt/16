<L>__{interior ned's law office late afternoon}
<A>__{ned turns the key... enters through the private door. he hears the plaintive sound of a saxophone playing lola's theme... his eyes drawn to the slightly opened door to the outer office. angle ned's pov thru opening a gorgeous pair of legs, sleek nylons, high heeled shoes. there are several candy wrappers, cigarette butts and other pieces of trash stuck to the bottom of one shoe.}
<B>__{ned}
<A>__{pushes the door open. it's lola. she wears a tight white dress, long white gloves and broad brimmed hat. the hat tips up slowly, revealing her eyes.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{i waited. you never came back.}
<A>__{ned reaches in his pocket, pulls out a wet paper towel.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i got busy. here's that paper towel i promised.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{thanks...}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{how'd you get in? the door was locked.}
<A>__{lola proudly holds up a tiny bobbie pin. she smiles.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{it's miraculous what a real woman can do... with a bobbie pin.}
<A>__{ned looks at the door. the frame and lock have been brutally chewed away, as if someone used a jackhammer on them! she pulls out a pack of cigarettes... black lung lites.}
<C>__{lola}
<P>__{(offering)}
<D>__{cigarette?}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{no... thanks. they're bad for ya.}
<A>__{he goes to the water cooler. she lights up, exhaling a soft cloud of smoke through a sleepy smile, her voice purring.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{yes, i know. i like things that are bad for me.}
<P>__{(touching lawbooks)}
<D>__{so... i hear you go both ways.}
<A>__{ned hesitates... about to drink from the paper cup.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{only once. it was a fraternity prank. i never saw him again.}
<A>__{he gulps the water down, crumbles the cup in his hand.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{no, i mean... you're a cop and a lawyer.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{oh. yeah. well, there's a lot of scum out there on the streets... but they all deserve a fair and costly trial.}
<A>__{ned turns, tries to casually "dunk" the crumpled cup in the waste basket. he misses. laura enters with a huge pile of lawbooks in her arms. she sees ned miss the basket and darts over as he bends down to pick it up.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i will get that.}
<A>__{she picks it up and tosses it into the waste basket.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{oh... laura... this is, uh...}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{lola cain.}
<A>__{laura sets the heavy load of books on the desk and steps toward lola, extending her hand. lola takes her time removing the long white glove... finally reaching out and shaking laura's hand with a condescending air.}
<C>__{lola}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{so lovely to meet you, laura.}
<A>__{ned grabs the books and turns to the bookshelf, replacing each lawbook in its proper slot. the "handshake" between lola and laura turns tense, then aggressive, eventually becoming a "standing indian wrestle" as they try to force each other off balance with sheer force. ned is oblivious to the battle behind him, chattering away.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{gotta keep these darn books in their right place or we'll never find the ones we need. let's see, q thru m... r thru b... w thru f...}
<A>__{laura suddenly whirls lola around, putting her in an arm lock. but lola elbows laura in the stomach! laura doubles over. lola feigns sympathy, taking her hand... then spins, twisting laura's arm, flipping her head over heels! laura lands on the couch... upside down... gasping. lola strikes a haughty pose, still holding her lit cigarette. she takes a drag. laura checks her watch, then tumbles off the couch, landing on her feet. she straightens her skirt.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{it's getting late. i will give you a ride home, ned.}
<A>__{finished with the books, ned turns... smiles.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i have my car.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i will tow you.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{not today. you don't need to wait. i will see you tomorrow.}
<A>__{lola looks at laura... icy, haughty, triumphant. laura moves reluctantly toward the door, sees the lock and door frame chewed to pieces... whirls around, heads back toward ned.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i should call someone to fix this...}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{tomorrow...}
<A>__{she instantly spins around, heads back toward the door...}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i will call from home.}
<A>__{...and exits. ned sits down on the corner of the desk. lola sits in the chair across from him.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{i think i should warn you, mr. ravine... i'm not wearing any underwear.}
<A>__{she crosses her legs suggestively... then slowly, enticingly, re crosses them in the other direction. unimpressed, ned opens laura's desk drawer... pulls a pair of sexy lace panties from a kleenex style dispenser box labeled "pandora's pop up panties"... which pulls another pair up into position. he tosses the panties to lola.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{try these on.}
<A>__{she does... very, very slowly and seductively... as they talk.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{so... what can i do for you?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{i've run across some... papers... and i thought you might be able to tell me what they are. you see, i'm not very experienced when it comes to... papers.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i will help you miss cain, if i'm able. do you have the... papers... here?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{no... they're at home. i thought you might stop by...}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i'm on duty tonight.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{don't they ever give you a night off?}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{yeah. tomorrow.}
<C>__{lola}
<P>__{(picks up cigarette)}
<D>__{why don't we meet tomorrow evening then?}
<A>__{she finishes pulling the panties on with a sultry smile... "snapping" the elastic waistband. she goes to the door, pauses... turns to him.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{i will let you know where.}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(steps over to her)}
<D>__{what's wrong with my office?}
<A>__{she looks around, exhaling another cloud of smoke.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{nothing a good interior decorator couldn't fix.}
<A>__{she opens the door. behind her, in the hall, we see dizzy, the saxophone player, wailing away on "lola's theme."}
<B>__{close on lola}
<A>__{she takes a final, long drag on her cigarette, then reaches o.s. with it... toward ned.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{take care of this for me, will ya?}
<A>__{with a sultry smile, she turns and leaves, closing the door.}
<B>__{angle on ned}
<A>__{the cigarette is stuck in his nose.}
