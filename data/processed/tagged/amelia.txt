<D>__{sure i can't talk you inta somethin' more adventurous?}
<A>__{she turns. fred noonan is tall and lean, ruggedly handsome in a reckless way. his flight clothes as rumpled and dirt streaked as her own. he carries his bottle of tequila, and a coke which he sets down for her.}

<D>__{amelia (v.o.) (cont’d) i didn’t know whether to laugh or throw something at the jerk.}
<A>__{he gestures again, more commandingly. sit. she doesn't move, she doesn't smile. she doesn't take her steady gaze from him. he hangs up the phone. they stare at each other for a frozen beat. he breaks the moment with a charming smile...}

<D>__{always nice to know what the real attraction is.}

<C>__{george}
<D>__{the plane was bought from adm. byrd by amy guest, a socialite who wanted the record for herself. her family wouldn't tolerate the danger. she has asked for a replacement...}

<D>__{...who is american, educated, well spoken, a flyer, preferably physically attractive...}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{why would that matter?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{because she wants the world to pay attention. and pretty girls command more attention.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{was that your advice?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{sure. my role is selling this event to the public. there will be a contract for the girl's story with the new york times. also a book to be published over her name.}
<A>__{understood...?}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{but all the money from these will go to mrs. guest.}

<D>__{you said she wants a flyer.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{don't get your hopes up. the celebrated wilmer stultz will be the pilot. there'll be a male co pilot and navigator. the woman will be purely a passenger.}
<A>__{he waits for reaction. she keeps her mouth shut.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{that's good for your chances. because your level of flying experience wouldn't place you anywhere near the group that would be considered for this. if the woman were to do any flying at all.}
<A>__{no punches pulled. not his style.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{why would anyone want a book from a passenger?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{because the hook is that we're making the woman the commander. the pilot will sign a contract saying he is under her direction and control. it's her ship, her flight.}
<C>__{amelia}

<D>__{we.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{that's right. if you're not in there selling with me, it won't work.}

<D>__{you're the star. i'm no one at all.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{spoken like a gentleman.}

<C>__{amelia }

<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{i remember the first kiss.}
<A>__{it is only one step. her hand goes to his chest. her eyes close, as... she brings her mouth to his. tender and strong. and deep. it is an act of decision. a held look. no one smiles. we hear her name announced from the podium. but she keeps looking at him. and as the applause continues, she finally... ...turns. strides onto the stage, with one graceful wave, she brings the applause to a crescendo.}
<D>__{amelia (v.o.) (cont’d) of course, i knew all the stories that dorothy had been having a torrid affair with fred upton. everyone did.}

<C>__{george }
<D>__{i will tell you why it's a front page story. because amelia pulled every woman out of the race. so the organizers had to roll over and give in, or they'd have lost their shirts. you want me to write your headline?}

<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{i think it would be huge for women flyers if amelia won the derby. the publicity would put the race, and all of you, up there with the boys.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{i'm not sure she has much of a chance, mr. putnam.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well, the one shot would be putting her in a far more powerful plane than anything she's flown. we're thinking the lockheed vega.}
<A>__{the girl's shock. he really means this.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{sir, i've test piloted the vega. it's way more than she could ever handle. it wouldn't be safe, let alone successful.}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{that's why i'm thinking of you flying with her. you could handle the cross country flying, the more difficult bits, and i'd pay you $75 a week.}

<D>__{well, i think that's the most generous opportunity i've ever been offered.}
<A>__{he stares at her.}
