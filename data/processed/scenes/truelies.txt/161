<L>__{exterior street vette day}
<A>__{they are cruising along, with harry driving this time.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you working on someone right now?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i always have a couple on the hook. you know. there's one right now, i've got her panting like a dog. it's great.}
<A>__{unconsciously, harry's hands clench the wheel tighter.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what does she do?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{some kinda legal secretary of something. married to some boring jerk.}
<A>__{harry takes a corner too fast. the tires squealing.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{and she could be so hot, if she wanted to be. she's like a dying plant that just needs a little water.}
<A>__{when simon is looking, harry is open and encouraging... they laugh together... then when he looks away harry goes snake eyed. he could kill simon with one punch. he's visualizing his wife getting porked by this guy.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{but with you, she gets to be hot, right?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{red hot. her thighs steam.}
<A>__{they laugh together. harry's laugh is getting a bit brittle. he speeds up, his knuckles white on the wheel. now for the big question: have they or haven't they?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(yelling suddenly)}
<D>__{hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!}
