<A>__{kirk with mccoy and spock, who although somewhat shaky, is clearly more alert. they are just assuming their stations.}
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{we're now locked into starfleet's transceivers; admiral nogura has received your reports, sir.}
<A>__{angle including viewer (o) kirk pausing halfway to his chair to study the viewer on which is appearing an image of v'ger looming omi nously in orbit over earth .}
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{the visual is a lunar monitor relay, sir.}
<A>__{as they begin to study it, the image suddenly distorts and is replaced by signal interference signal static lines}
<B>__{running across the viewer screen.}
<A>__{(somewhat resembling the kind of high voltage interference some times seen on the television screen.)}
<C>__{uhura}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{heavy interference, sir it's coming from here, inside the intruder itself...}
<A>__{uhura hits buttons and immediately from the speakers we hear a series of carrier wave beeps. spock looks up from his console, listens to it.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{puzzling! the interference appears to be a rather simple carrier wave code signal...}
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{on an old style radio frequency, sir...}
<B>__{past kirk to the elevator}
<A>__{as the doors snap open and decker and "ilia" appear. all eyes go to them as:}
<D>__{"ilia"}
<P>__{(to decker; interrupting)}
<D>__{as i stated, v'ger calls to the creator.}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(nods; turns to kirk)}
<D>__{v'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect... "ilia" 'to learn all that is learnable.'}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(to kirk)}
<D>__{it expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the creator.}
<C>__{uhura}
<P>__{(whirling)}
<D>__{sir! v'ger's signals have stopped... "ilia"}
<P>__{(as if frightened)}
<D>__{decker... the creator has not responded.}
<A>__{kirk hears this, turning inquiringly toward her, but uhura interrupts:}
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{picking up starfleet again; a lunar monitor relay...}
<A>__{angle including viewer (o) as, indeed, the interference is fading and a new main viewer image is appearing it shows v'ger in earth orbit with a strange looking object moving away from v'ger. it is an ominous looking, huge swirling green mass it resembles the same green plasma energy bolts that destroyed the klingons and epsilon 9 and very nearly the enterprise. it is not a bolt now the mass is much larger and appears much more deadly . a second object has now formed and moves off, a third one begins to appear. (meanwhile, the first and second plasma energy objects are moving off into the distance in different direction.)}
<D>__{mccoy my god! they're the same kind of things that destroyed the klingons, epsilon nine...}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(interrupting; from science console)}
<D>__{these read as identical composition...}
<P>__{(turns to kirk)}
<D>__{... however, captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{high mag, mr. sulu!}
<A>__{sulu adjusts the viewer through several image magni fications until we see the huge ominous green devices more clearly.}
<C>__{sulu}
<D>__{the third one is moving off too a fourth one is forming...}
<C>__{uhura}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{urgent signal from starfleet, captain!}
<P>__{(turns, shaken)}
<D>__{all earth defense systems have gone dead.}
<A>__{kirk reacts hard at this. uhura gets another message.}
<C>__{uhura}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{sir, starfleet computes their trajectories as moving toward equidistant positions over earth.}
<A>__{another angle kirk and spock exchanging significant glances.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{from four equidistant positions, captain, a detonation would blanket the entire surface of the planet.}
<C>__{difalco}
<D>__{i plot them as reaching equidistant positions in... twenty nine minutes, sir... mark!}
<A>__{across kirk to decker and "ilia" as kirk vaults from his chair, strides to a handrail to confront the "ilia" probe.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{why ...?! "ilia" the carbon units infection will now be removed from the creator's planet.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{why ?! "ilia" the creator has not answered.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{the carbon units are not responsible for that. "ilia" you infest and control enterprise. v'ger believes carbon units interfere with the creator in the same manner.}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(to kirk)}
<D>__{then v'ger believes the creator to be a machine too.}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{it seems we all imagine god in our own image.}
<A>__{angle on main viewer including chekov (o) three of the four ominous swirling green objects have all moved away from v'ger now, in different directions, growing smaller in the distance. the fourth object is holding position nearby, seeming to grow in size and intensity.}
<B>__{angle emphasizing kirk}
<A>__{as he throws a look toward spock who is now in deep meditation. kirk turns and takes "ilia's" shoulders and carefully turns her to face him.}
<D>__{mccoy '... similar life forms...?' jim, v'ger's saying the creator is a machine ...!}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(grimly amused)}
<D>__{of course: we all create god in our own image.}
<A>__{kirk peers at decker a moment, ingesting this thought. then he addresses "ilia" again, this time with emotion: after all, he is pleading for the survival of the entire planet:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{v'ger! if we are lesser beings, we are still, like you, living. and because we are alive, we like you wish to survive. you must not destroy }
<A>__{kirk pauses abruptly: "ilia" is regarding him blandly, stonily not the slightest reaction or response; clearly kirk's plea is being ignored. kirk draws in his breath to continue, realizes the futility, turns helplessly to spock.}
<B>__{across kirk to spock}
<A>__{who has been listening intently, with near fascination an idea forming in his mind. quickly, he steps down to kirk:}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(quiet, terse)}
<D>__{captain...}
<P>__{(reaches kirk)}
<D>__{treat v'ger as you would... a child .}
<B>__{favoring kirk}
<A>__{startled at this, not sure he's heard correctly.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{child...!?}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{yes, captain, a child: evolving into adulthood learning, searching instinctively needing.}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(intrigued)}
<D>__{needing what ...? mccoy spock, this 'child' is about to eliminate all life on earth; how do we teach it that that's 'wrong'? with a spanking ...!?}
<A>__{spock peers at mccoy almost sadly, then replies to decker.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{it doesn't know what it needs, comm ander...}
<P>__{(to kirk)}
<D>__{it does not know.}
<A>__{kirk says nothing, looks at spock who is awaiting a reaction; then kirk glances at "ilia" his brain is racing, struggling to reach a decision. and then:}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(abruptly to "ilia")}
<D>__{the carbon units know why the creator has not responded. mccoy}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{jim...!}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(to "ilia," urgingly)}
<D>__{ilia... we can help v'ger find what it needs }
<A>__{"ilia" studies decker just a bland beat, then turns to kirk:}
<D>__{"ilia"}
<P>__{(to kirk, hard)}
<D>__{disclose the information.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(cool, calm)}
<D>__{not until v'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet. "ilia" kirk unit! disclose the information!}
<A>__{kirk studies her a moment, then decides to press his bet:}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(to "ilia," almost pleasant)}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(then to crew commandingly)}
<D>__{secure all stations. clear the bridge.}
<A>__{a moment where all are startled at this order but no time for questions as just then the ship is rocked by a furious powerful eruption nearby within v'ger.}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(amplified)}
<D>__{bridge to all decks,secure your stations. mccoy your child is having a tantrum, spock.}
<C>__{sulu}
<D>__{clear the bridge, captain...?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{that was the order, mr. sulu: clear the bridge.}
<A>__{just then another eruption the ship is rocked again.}
