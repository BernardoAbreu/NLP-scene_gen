<A>__{all we can see are the lights of the heart of gold's entry ramp cutting through a dense fog. or is it fog? zaphod's 2nd head is up as he comes down the ramp ahead of the other three.}

<A>__{back a few steps with arthur, trillian and ford...}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{why does he keep saying that?}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{i don't know. i'm not used to seeing him this way.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you mean fully clothed?}
<A>__{she stops, fires him a look.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{sorry, but i can't for the life of me figure out why you, the most brilliant woman i have ever met, have ended up with that half witted, self obsessed, vapid politician! i mean, look at him!}
<A>__{they squint through the fog at zaphod, head 2 out. his hands keep trying to get it down but the 3rd arm keeps whacking them away. he disappears into the fog.}

<C>__{ford }
<D>__{i wouldn't tell her if i were you.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{she deserves to know.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{but if you tell her and she ends up with you because you're literally the last guy on earth you'll always doubt her intentions.}

<D>__{got your towel?}
<C>__{arthur}

<A>__{zaphod continues several steps ahead of them.}
<C>__{guide voice }
<D>__{many races believe that it was created by some sort of god, though the jatravartid people of viltvodle 6 firmly believe that the entire universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the great green arkleseizure. the jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear}
