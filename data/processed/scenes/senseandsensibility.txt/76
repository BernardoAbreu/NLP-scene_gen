<L>__{exterior meadow near barton cottage day}
<A>__{having been denied their trip, the dashwoods and willoughby have set out an impromptu picnic. willoughby is wandering restlessly about. the weather is sublime.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{frailty, thy name is brandon!}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{there are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure. i think he wrote the letter himself as a trick for getting out of it.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<P>__{(indulgently)}
<D>__{you are a very wicked pair, colonel brandon will be sadly missed.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{why? when he is the kind of man that everyone speaks well of and no one wants to talk to.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{exactly!}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{nonsense.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{colonel brandon is very highly esteemed at the park.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{which is enough censure in itself.}
<C>__{elinor}
<P>__{(half laughing)}
<D>__{really, willoughby!}
<C>__{willoughby}
<P>__{(imitating mrs jennings perfectly)}
<D>__{come, come, mr impudence i know you and your wicked ways oh!}
<A>__{he gives a little shriek and waddles about the garden doing her walk. he comes up to elinor and puts his head on her shoulder.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{come, miss dashwood, reveal your beau, reveal him, i say! let's have no secrets between friends! let me winkle them out of you!}
<A>__{elinor hits him on the nose with her teaspoon and he waddles off to marianne.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<P>__{(as mrs jennings)}
<D>__{i declare, miss marianne, if i do not have you married to the colonel by teatime, i shall swallow my own bonnet.}
<A>__{marianne laughs. willoughby drops the parody suddenly.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{as if you could marry such a character.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{why should you dislike him?}
<A>__{there is indeed an edge to willoughby's raillery. he flicks elinor an almost alarmed glance and then sweeps marianne to her feet and starts to dance around the garden with her.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{because he has threatened me with rain when i wanted it fine, he has found fault with the balance of my curricle and i cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare. if it will be of any satisfaction to you, however, to be told i believe his character to be in all other respects irreproachable, i am ready to confess it. and in return for an acknowledgement that must give me some pain.}
<P>__{(he is slowing down)}
<D>__{you cannot deny me the privilege...}
<P>__{(slower still)}
<D>__{of disliking him...}
<P>__{(and stopping)}
<D>__{as much as i adore...}
<A>__{he and marianne are standing looking at each other. the expression on willoughby's face is heart stopping. margaret has stopped eating and is staring with her mouth open. elinor glances at mrs dashwood but she is gazing up at them with almost as many stars in her eyes as marianne. suddenly willoughby breaks the mood by swinging away from marianne and gesturing to the house.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{ this cottage!}
<A>__{the tension is broken. margaret starts to chew again.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{i have great plans for improvements to it, you know, mr willoughby.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{now that i will never consent to. not a stone must be added to its walls. were i rich enough, i would instantly pull down combe magna and build it up again in the exact image of that cottage!}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{with dark, narrow stairs, a poky hall and a fire that smokes?}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{especially the fire that smokes! then i might be as happy at combe magna as i have been at barton.}
<A>__{he looks at marianne, who has gone to sit at her mother's feet.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{but this place has one claim on my affection which no other can possibly share.}
<A>__{marianne is so irradiated with happiness that she looks like an angel.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{promise me you will never change it.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{i do not have the heart.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{or the money.}
