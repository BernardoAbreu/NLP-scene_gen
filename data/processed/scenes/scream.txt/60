<L>__{exterior tatum's house afternoon later}
<A>__{the late afternoon sun is quickly disappearing. tatum and sidney rock on the front porch looking out into the small town neighborhood. dewey's patrol jeep is parked in the driveway. despite loud music, blaring from an inside stereo, this is a quiet moment.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{maybe cotton weary is telling the truth. maybe he was having an affair with your mom.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{so you think my mom was a slut too?}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{i didn't say that, sid. but you know there were rumors. your dad was always out of town on business. maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{if they were having an affair how come that cotton couldn't prove it in court?}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{you can't prove a rumor. that's why it's a rumor.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{created by that little tabloid twit gale weathers.}
<C>__{tatum}
<P>__{(delicately)}
<D>__{it goes further back, sid. there's been talk about other men.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{and you believe it?}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{well...you can only hear that richard gere gerbil story so many times before}
<A>__{you have to start believing it. a long silence as sidney agonizes over all of this. she stands up and moves to the edge of the porch and stares out onto the neighborhood.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{if i was wrong cotton, then he's still out there.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{don't go there, sid. you're starting to sound like some wes carpenter flick. don't freak yourself out we've got a long night ahead of us.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you're right. i'm cracking up. ignore me.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{come on, let's rock.}
<A>__{sid follows tatum inside the house never seeing the ghost masked figure that stands across the street, under a tree. his presence so subtle and unobtrusive you'd have to see this movie a second time to know he was there all along.}
