<L>__{interior lower landing night}
<A>__{julia walks along the landing, while the laughter muted by distance wafts up from below. from the floor above, she hears something more. she stops, puzzled, then starts up the second flight of stairs towards the torture room.}
<L>__{interior upper landing night}
<A>__{she approaches the torture room, and steps inside.}
<L>__{interior torture room night}
<A>__{the sound of laughter is considerably dimmed in here; it's barely audible. but there is another sound, a shifting sound in the corner of the room. she reaches for the light switch, and turns it on. the bulb's been broken however. she stares around the room, trying to make sense of the shadows. nervously, she approaches the wall, on which four streaks of light from the window fall. now she looks towards the window and realizes that the newspaper has been torn, as if by four fingers. her breath catches. suddenly, she's afraid. she stands absolutely still, eyes wide in the gloom.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{who's there?}
<A>__{on the far side of the room, a movement in the shadows. julia almost retreats, but something keeps her staring into the murk, as something the remnants of a human form made of twisted, blistered strands of flesh, raises its head. it's squatting against the wall, unable to lift itself into a standing position. its eyes, however, have life in them: and hunger. this, though he's unrecognizable, is frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(a pained whisper)}
<D>__{julia.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{don't look at me.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i said: don't look.}
<A>__{she looks away.}
<D>__{help me.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{tell me who you are.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{frank.}
<A>__{julia's face registers horror and disbelief.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{no. god no.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{believe me. it's me. it's really me.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{what happened to you?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{his blood ... on the floor ... it brought me back.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{back from where?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{just help, will you? please god, help me }
<A>__{from downstairs, dimly, laughter.}
