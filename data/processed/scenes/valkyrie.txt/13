<L>__{exterior desert day}
<A>__{titles: tunisia, north africa the retreating 10th panzer division. 7 april 1943. moving rapidly through an olive grove in the otherwise wasted desert. a column of tanks, trucks and heavy equipment flow by with a sense of barely contained chaos. men dismantle tents from around others dumping documents into burning oil drums. in the middle of it we find a tall, handsome young officer (age 35). he wears an afrika korps uniform complete with colonel's badges, staying cooler than the other side of your pillow. he directs men this way and that, holding back panic. titles: colonel claus von stauffenberg staff officer, 10th panzer division. a jeep speeds up to him from the distance, driven by a young lieutenant.}
<C>__{young lieutenant}
<D>__{colonel stauffenberg, sir. a new headquarters has been established at mezzouna. i'm to take you there.}
<A>__{stauffenberg looks over the scene, expressionless.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{now they tell us to disengage a day late. no matter how many times we tell command the reality, they always manage to leave us }
<A>__{but he stops himself, containing his rage.}
<C>__{young lieutenant}
<D>__{colonel, the enemy is less than five kilometers from here. you've done all you can.}
<A>__{stauffenberg glances at his right hand, contemplating a ring on his finger. after a beat:}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{i wonder... was there even a point in our coming to tunis?}
<C>__{young lieutenant}
<D>__{to get taken prisoner, it seems.}
<A>__{stauffenberg smiles bitterly and gets in the jeep as: boom. the first bomb explodes before we even see the tight formation of british fire bombers overhead. fighter planes strafe with machine guns. artillery blasts strike in front and behind the retreating column. the 10th panzer division is trapped. panic hits the column like a tidal wave. stauffenberg taps the young lieutenant who drives into the melee. soldiers abandon their vehicles but cover is in short supply and many are left in the open. so they run. dozens are gunned down by the assailing fighters. the survivors watch in horror as the fighters slowly turn to make another run. in a panic, the soldiers run the other direction, halted by a jeep blocking the way. stauffenberg stands in the passenger seat.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{stop. wait until they commit.}
<A>__{the men calm when they see the colonel, trusting him. they turn and watch the formation of planes complete their turn and bear down, gaining speed. knees tense, some jerking from the natural inclination to flee.}
<C>__{stauffenberg }
<D>__{stand fast, i said.}
<A>__{they do, despite the menace of the planes' engines growing louder, meaner...}
