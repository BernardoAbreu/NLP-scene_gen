<T>__{cut on laughter to:}
<A>__{the reception area (interior night): a domino's pizza delivery man, waiting for clearance from a security guard, on andrew's dim and quiet floor, watches as... seidman, kenton and andrew follow charles wheeler up a wide, carpeted staircase. wheeler finishes a story and everyone}
<B>__{laughs...}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{a box of cigars being handed around (interior night) ...}
<C>__{seidman}
<D>__{andy's expressed a keen interest in the kronos inc. situation, charles. is that correct, andy?}
<A>__{the lawyers have gathered in wheeler's spacious office, with its floor to ceiling view of the philadelphia skyline.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{the fate of the participants interests me, yes sir.}
<A>__{wheeler, kenton and seidman proceed with the male ritual of preparing cigars to be smoked: snipping the ends with a brass clip, rolling them over their tongues to wet them, sliding the cigars in and out of their rounded mouths. andrew, holding a cigar but not preparing to light it, watches with a not completely concealed twinkle in his eye. wheeler leans back in his chair, swirling a brandy snifter. he exhales cigar smoke with a great deal of pleasure.}
<C>__{kenton}
<D>__{it's good to be king, hey charles?}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{kings are out of fashion. i'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.}
<P>__{(prompting andrew)}
<D>__{it's an anti trust action.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{it is, and it isn't, charles. macrosystem's new software copies all the best known elements of kronos' spreadsheet program. if they're allowed to sell it, kronos will get undersold right out of business. for me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{bearing in mind that bill wright, the chairman of macrosystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would you desire to be on, andy? and don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with bill to influence your answer in any way.}
<A>__{andrew knows this is a test. and he loves it.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{sorry, charles, but...}
<A>__{andrew is distracted by a light falling across his face.}
<C>__{andrew }
<D>__{i'd like to see kronos win.}
<A>__{walter kenton has shifted a lamp, so that its light falls across andrew's face, revealing: a faint purple blotch about the size of a quarter, much like the blotches we saw on the hispanic patient in andrew's doctor's office.}
<C>__{kenton}
<D>__{why, beckett?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{because they deserve to, walter.}
<A>__{andrew lifts his hand, finding that his hair has been pushed back, revealing the blotch. he stands, nonchalantly running a hand through his hair to cover the blotch.}
<C>__{andrew }
<D>__{if macrosystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand americans will be out of work. moreover, the laws of copyright and anti trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit macrosystems is trying to pull.}
<C>__{seidman}
<D>__{andy, do you know who reps kronos inc.?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{bailey, brackman.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{get with the program, andy. as of this evening, about 8:05 this evening, right after the soup course... kronos incorporated is represented by wyant wheeler hellerman tetlow and brown. or, more specifically, senior associate andrew beckett.}
<A>__{a moment before it sinks in, then: andrew clenches his fist in a victory salute.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{seidman}
<D>__{you'll have to get right on it, andy, we're up against the statute of limitations.}
<A>__{an associate lawyer in shirtsleeves taps on the office door.}
<C>__{associate lawyer}
<D>__{tokyo on four, bob.}
<C>__{seidman}
<D>__{great. excuse me, fellas.}
<P>__{(picking up a phone, speaking japanese)}
<D>__{connichiwa. itsumo osewa ni nari mashita. arigato gozaimasu.}
<A>__{andrew offers his hand to walter kenton.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{thanks, walter.}
<C>__{kenton}
<D>__{what's that on your forehead, pal?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{whacked with a racquetball.}
<P>__{(taking wheeler's hand)}
<D>__{i appreciate your faith in my abilities.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{faith, andy, is the belief in something for which we have no evidence. it doesn't apply to this situation.}
<P>__{(slapping his shoulder)}
<D>__{go home. i mean, get back to work.}
<A>__{andrew and wheeler are eye to eye, an intimate moment.}
<C>__{andrew}
<P>__{(warmly, softly)}
<D>__{thanks, charles.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<P>__{(with a father's affection)}
<D>__{no sweat, buddy.}
<A>__{smiling, andrew exits the office. close on walter kenton, thinking...}
