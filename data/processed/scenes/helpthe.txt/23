<L>__{exterior constantine's house day}
<A>__{skeeter's car pulls into the overgrown yard of an old shack with a rusted out tin roof. two clapboard rooms are separated by an open breezeway. the front door is cracked opened. skeeter gets out and walks toward constantine's home.}
<L>__{interior constantine's house moments later}
<A>__{skeeter enters to find only a small bed, dresser, table, rocking chair and a wood burning stove. past intruders have long since taken anything of value. as skeeter approaches constantine's bed, an opossum scurries out from underneath. skeeter screams as the opossum runs out the door. her eyes suddenly catch something. lying on the bed is an old corn pipe. skeeter picks it up and brings it to her face. her eyes begin to well up.}
