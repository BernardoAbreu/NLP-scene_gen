<L>__{interior penthouse bedroom morning}
<A>__{vivian is asleep. she turns over, slowly waking. her hand goes out to touch edward and encounters nothing but empty bed. vivian comes awake with a sudden start. she look around momentarily frightened, not sure where she is. sighing with relief, she lies back down. she sees edward's american express card on the pillow next to her.}
<C>__{edward }
<D>__{wake up, vivian. time to shop.}
<A>__{edward comes out of the bathroom and moves toward the bed. he is tying his tie. vivian sits up and ties it for him. he smiles at her.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i still don't understand why you only bought one dress.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{i wasn't as much fun as i thought it was going to be.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you? it works.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{was someone rude to you?}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{i had a little problem in one store. i wasn't dressed right. i don't know what to say. i don't belong there. maybe i will just go back to bridget. she was cool.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{vivian, you belong wherever you are. i don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.}
<A>__{edward sits on the bed.}
<C>__{edward }
<D>__{people aren't going to respect you unless you respect yourself.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{the next time someone is rude to you, you stare at them right here.}

<C>__{edward }
