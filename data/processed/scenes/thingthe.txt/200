<A>__{macready charges up the stairs from the plant room. he zooms down the twisting corridors, opening and closing doors. he rounds a bend and crashes into nauls coming the other way.}

<L>__{interior rec room close on sanchez}
<A>__{pouring gasoline into empty bottles, preparing molotov cocktails. garry is connecting an electrical device: wires attached to two portable generators. macready appears to be injecting something into empty contact capsules. the men work feverishly. nauls rushes in with another box of dynamite.}
<C>__{nauls}
<D>__{what about childs?}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{forget about childs. he's over.}
<A>__{nauls begins cutting the wicks off the dynamite.}
<C>__{garry}
<D>__{make 'em short. they'll go off quicker if we need to use them.}
<A>__{the wind belts into the roofing overhead. garry sets the wiring to the main doorway. macready begins blocking off one of the other entrances with a large computer.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{what if it doesn't come?}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{it'll come. it needs us. we're the only thing left to imitate...}
<P>__{(to sanchez)}
<D>__{give me a hand.}
<A>__{they block off a door with two heavy electrical games.}
<C>__{macready}
<P>__{(to sanchez)}
<D>__{you and nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.}
<C>__{nauls}
<P>__{(protest)}
<D>__{you crazy? he might be inside already?}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{chance we got to take. we got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged.}
<A>__{nauls starts lacing his skates.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{he might just wait us out.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{i'm going to blow the generator when you get back. he'll have to come for us or freeze.}
<A>__{macready further barricades the door with small couch.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{we've got portable heaters we'll last longer.}
<A>__{sanchez and nauls start to leave.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{...hold it.}
<A>__{he dispenses the capsules.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{sodium cyanide. we place them between our cheeks and gums... this thing can't imitate anything that's dead.}
<A>__{a grim silence.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{if it gets a hold of you bite down... they're supposed to be fast and painless... now move.}
