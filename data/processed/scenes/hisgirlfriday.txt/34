<D>__{"but the state has a production for use plan, too. it has a gallows and at seven a.m., unless a miracle occurs, that gallows will be used to separate the soul of earl williams from his body. and out of molly malloy's life will go the one kindly soul she ever knew "}
<P>__{(he stops)}
<D>__{that's as far as hildy got. but, i ask you, can that girl write an interview?}

<D>__{don't give us that ethics stuff. you'll be the only one who'll swipe any of it.}
<C>__{schwartz}

<D>__{oh, is that you, walter dear? oh, i didn't mean "dear." that was just habit, i guess. oh, be yourself, walter. i've got some news for you... yes, i got the interview, but i've got some news that's more important.}
<A>__{the others are listening, suspecting a scoop.}
<C>__{hildy}

<D>__{hear that? that's the interview i wrote... yes, i know we made a bargain. i just said i'd write it i didn't say i wouldn't tear it up. yes, it's all in little pieces now, walter, and i hope to do the same for you some time!}
<A>__{she hangs up.}
<B>__{med. shot featuring hildy}
<A>__{she reaches under her desk, pulls up bag, talking all the time. the others are too startled to do anything but listen.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{and that's my farewell to the newspaper game. i'm going to live a normal life and have a home.}
<A>__{she reaches into the drawer of desk and gets some stuff which she puts into bag.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{i'm going to be a woman, not a newsgetting machine. i'm going to have babies and nurse them and love them and give 'em cod liver oil and worry about their new teeth and the minute i catch one of them even looking at a newspaper, i'm going to brain him! where's my hat?}
<A>__{someone points to her hat. she rises and goes toward it. her bag is still open. her phone rings. schwartz answers it.}
<C>__{schwartz}
<P>__{(subdued tones)}
