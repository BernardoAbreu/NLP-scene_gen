<D>__{milt, your new book is called the end of the world. isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease. yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{well, i think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?}

<D>__{i predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on new year's eve.}

<D>__{this year? that's cutting it a little close, isn't it? i mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right? so you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year. and it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie of the week or mini series potential. you would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.}
<C>__{milton}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{this is not just some money making scheme! i didn't just make up the date. i have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on new year's eve.}

<D>__{valentine's day. that's got to be a bummer. where did you get that date, elaine?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i received this information from an alien. i was at the paramus holiday inn, i was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking. then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{your alien had a room in the holiday inn?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{it may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the holiday inn. i can't be sure, peter.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(humoring her)}
<D>__{no, you can't, and i think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. you may get some nice ones occasionally like starman or e.t., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard. anyway, we're just about out of time.}

<P>__{(staring at it)}
<D>__{there's something very familiar about this painting.}
<L>__{interior museum new painting night}
<A>__{it's a beautiful painting in the high renaissance style depicting four archangels hovering protectively over a cherubic baby. one holds a harp, one, an olive branch, the third, a book, and the last, a sword. most remarkably, their faces bear an uncanny resemblance to venkman, stantz, spengler and winston.}
