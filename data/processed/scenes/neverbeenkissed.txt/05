<L>__{interior josie's office continuous}
<A>__{josie enters, reads the messsage still gingerly held in two fingers, and drops it into the trash can. she hangs her coat squarely on the back of her door, takes five pencils from her pencil pot, one by one sharpens them in her pencil sharpener, and then lays them out neatly in a row. she smiles, satisfied, ready for another day. anita brandt, late 20's, pretty in a semi unprofessional way, bursts in, smiling.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{guess who i did it with last night...}
<C>__{josie}
<P>__{(duh)}
<D>__{roger in op ed.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{who told!}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{you did. yesterday you said, and i quote, "i have a date with roger from op ed tonight and i'm going to do it with him."}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.}
<A>__{josie just stares at her.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{once it didn't happen for sure.}
<A>__{gus strauss, late 30's, would probably clean up well, enters. he tosses some copy onto josie's desk.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{computer's down. septuplets story. i need it back by five. hopefully the copy's not a mess.}
<C>__{josie}
<P>__{(emphasizing)}
<D>__{it is hoped that it's not a mess. "hopefully" is an adverb. it means "with hope". you have it defining the copy, and i'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.}
<A>__{gus and anita just stare at josie.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{well, excuse me for caring about words.}
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(to anita)}
<D>__{so. you and roger in op ed.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{oh, man! who told?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{roger in op ed. don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter office dating.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{intra office. and they're not dating. they're having sex.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{and what is your policy? that if you're not getting any, no one can?}
<A>__{anita flounces off.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{how many times have i fired her?}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{five six }
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(shrugging, giving up)}
<D>__{eh.}
<A>__{gus turns to exit.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{hey gus did you see the story idea i left on your desk?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{yeah the blind foster home mother. it was good. i got cahoon on it.}
<C>__{josie}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{oh. cahoon. yeah, he's good.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{geller, we've been over this. you're a great copy editor. maybe my best copy editor. you're not a reporter.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{you've done five of my ideas.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{you know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{they don't have to be in the office christmas show?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{a flack jacket.}
<C>__{josie}
<P>__{(not getting it)}
<D>__{a flack jacket.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{every tom, dick, and harry thinks he can write. but a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. he's aggressive. grabs the bull by the balls.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{you don't think i can grab bulls' balls?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{geller, you don't want a reporter's life. they're very messy. you're all about order. control. and getting me my copy by five.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{hey i can be out of control.}
<A>__{gus smiles. on his way out he re adjusts josie's nameplate so it hangs at an angle. tormented, josie waits a beat. she can't take it, and runs to the door and straightens it.}
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(over his shoulder)}
<D>__{copy by five.}
