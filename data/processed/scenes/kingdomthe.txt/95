<L>__{interior prince bin khaled's palace later}
<A>__{the prince sits on a sea of pillows. there are several small flat screens playing business reports, cnn and al jazeera. seen from behind the prince: everyone but leavitt standing next to faces we've never seen. the table holds six gold serving platters. enough food to kill a famine, tended by a frenzy of servants. sykes puts a hand over his cup to stop the constant tea re fill. leavitt stands to the prince's left, thick leather glove on his hand, a falcon perched on it. leavitt holds it away from the rest of his body like he's already made peace with losing the arm. servants hold three others close by.}
<C>__{prince bin khaled}
<D>__{his talons slice bone.}
<C>__{adam leavitt}
<D>__{super.}
<C>__{prince bin khaled}
<D>__{that's my most prolific hunter. i'm trying to teach his friends there by example, but i fear it's something you're born with or not. do you agree, mr. ronald? innate or not at all?}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{prince bin khaled}
<P>__{(nodding: i could tell)}
<D>__{what have you seen so far of our kingdom? and know i can arrange tours anywhere within our borders.}
<A>__{when i bull rush our hosts you'll know it: in his quiet, calm amidst the bullets tone:}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{i've seen that the man who planned the worst crime in your kingdom's history is without a doubt saudi...}
<A>__{pin drop silence in response to fleury murdering the prince's "lite subjects," his attempt to extend the gilded circle jerk by offering tours. bin khaled's face sinks to gray again after the excited pink of talking about his falcons. his hand slowly moves back over his stomach: napoleon's ulcers. as fleury speaks, people unconsciously put their tea cups down, look up at him with wide eyes.}
<C>__{ronald fleury }
<D>__{..and that if you walk 300 kilometers from the compound, you will find a rooftop where the attacks were planned. i've seen that the person in this room "born with it" is right there...}
<P>__{(points at a gawking al ghazi)}
<D>__{everything i just said came from colonel al ghazi: his observations of the scene while he was protecting us. and i think you're absolutely right sir: that kind of instinct can't be taught: not to falcons. definitely not to sang generals. innate or not at all.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you want the murder to stop as much as i do. let us help.}
<A>__{the prince stares at fleury, cataloguing everything fleury just said. stands. in arabic:}
<C>__{prince bin khaled}
<D>__{colonel al ghazi, a word.}
<A>__{as the prince walks out with al ghazi, he signals another corps of servants to serve another round of cups: coffee. dinner over. a servant takes the falcon from leavitt just as he was starting to smile at it. fleury sips his coffee. schmidt and sykes approach.}
<C>__{grant sykes}
<D>__{that was impressive.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{think it will work?}
<C>__{grant sykes}
<D>__{yeah. maybe. i mean, you can only play the "i'm going to the press card" like three more times. so, maybe.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{they're paranoid and overly self protective.}
<C>__{damon schmidt}
<D>__{they aren't protecting anyone. there's no conspiracy. they're just terrified. finally. the saudis have finally seen the monsters they helped create, because those monsters have come home. and if saudis don't catch saudi monsters, that's the end.}
<A>__{fleury opens his mouth to interrupt.}
<C>__{damon schmidt }
<P>__{(right through fleury's attempt to speak)}
<D>__{and that end could come double quick if they let the us "shaytan" catch those monsters for them.}
<P>__{(fleury silent, gets it)}
<D>__{because that's what the saudi on the street suspects: the only thing keeping the royal family upright is american evil.}
<C>__{grant sykes}
<D>__{that's dead on accurate. very impressive. that's why they're making it hard on us, and that's why he wants to help `em turn the screws.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{they can have every shred of credit }
<C>__{damon schmidt}
<D>__{ you see the slums on the way in?}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{damon schmidt}
<D>__{see that even though their homes are falling down, they had satellite dishes bolted on?}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{damon schmidt}
<D>__{everyone already knows you're here. credit? if the saudis cracked this cell while these servants were pouring coffee, al jazeera still leads the story with your team.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{have you been to the crime scene?}
<C>__{damon schmidt}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{ if you had, you'd see the evil work of real talent. the kind that doesn't stop until it's forced.}
<C>__{damon schmidt}
<D>__{and the path to hell is paved with good intentions.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{you having fun?}
<C>__{damon schmidt}
<P>__{(genuine smile)}
<D>__{beats hell outta visa stamping.}
<P>__{(smile vanishing)}
<C>__{damon schmidt }
<D>__{you're on an island. i hope you know how to get off.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{by catching abu hamza.}
<A>__{raising his coffee, toasting fleury's cup:}
<C>__{damon schmidt}
<D>__{then here's to you. let's bet: when this colonel al ghazi comes out, he's in charge of the investigation if so, you set me up on a date with janet mayes.}
