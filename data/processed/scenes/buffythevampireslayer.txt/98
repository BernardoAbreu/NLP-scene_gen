<A>__{buffy stands under a tree, blindfolded. merrick stands a ways apart, watching. buffy stands very still, neck craned, waiting. silently, a leaf falls. it wafts gently down. buffy hurls a knife at it with easy precision. angle another tree the knife stick deep into the trunk, the leaf perfectly pinned. merrick looks at it. buffy smiles, knowing she has hit the target. blindfold still on, she turns toward merrick and walks into a branch, falls heavily backwards.}
