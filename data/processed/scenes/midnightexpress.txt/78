<A>__{billy bound in a thick leather belt (a kiyis) which screws tightly around the waist and cinches the hands together, is being hauled in continuing slow motion through a huge door somewhere in one of the cavernous corridors of the prison.the door is approximately nine feet by six feet, strong and wooden with a circular iron handle which one of the guards now pulls open; a glimpse of darkness within. the door closes. superimpose:}

<A>__{max, barely recognizable in a torn sheet and with a blackened face, comes rushing into a crowded room, screaming louder than any other inmate. marks on his face, he is enraged, blood dripping from scratch attendants in white smocks chase him over the beds. max is yelling in turkish.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{please, will you listen to me? will someone please listen to me? just listen to me!}
<C>__{attendants}
<D>__{hamidou! get hamidou! get the kiyisl!}
<A>__{the attendants wrestle with him, but he throws them off, tearing around the room mindlessly. in the process we see that not much attention is paid him because everybody else is crazy! there are 50 other lunatics yelling at each other in fights over sheets, blankets, beds, cigarettes, jumping: screaming, pushing, shoving; some babbling to themselves, rocking, crying, chanting, singing. several of them (the craziest) are stark naked. some, wrapped in torn blackened sheets, patrol the room like quick ferrets, sharp eyes open for anything they can steal. others move in meaningless, blank eyed silence. the walls are filthy black and join the ceilings in arches rather than angles, giving the look of an old dungeon. fifty beds are lined up right next to each other so that you walk right into your bed. a constant nerve racking noise. hamidou bursts into the room, the angry look in his eyes spelling real trouble for max. move with him as he sweep sin on max and picks him up with one move and smashes him against the wall. max hardly notices. another angle hamidou takes the leather kiyis from an attendant, moves in on max and starts clamping it around him. an attendant walks through the room with an apron containing several large pockets bulging with red, green, blue, white pills, which he distributes by the handful.}

<D>__{hop! hop! hop! full moon. hop! hop! hop!}
<A>__{the lunatics gobble them up as if they were candy. in some of the clustered areas, nine lunatics occupy as little as three beds. max is tightly bound now by hamidou, but his body arches against the bindings, his neck straining, his teeth snapping at the air. hamidou grabs him with one hand by the leather waist, hauls him high up in the air and throws max half ways across the room, max smashing heavily against some beds, continuing to scream off as: the attendant with the pills now bypasses billy on one of the beds.}
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{hop! hop! full moon take your pills!}
<A>__{billy gobbles them up. he has changed. lines in his face. no smile, no sense of humor; a brooding silence about him, a straight ahead look. he pays no attention to max off; he is in grubby white pyjamas and shower sandals. rolls back onto hi& bed with its filthy torn sheet, totally ignoring the surrounding commotion, and another angle turning onto his shoulder, billy suddenly finds himself face to face with a dark saddened visage. the man is very young and stark naked but for an old black rag wrapped around his head and clutched under his chin. his eyes are yellow, the voice pleading.}

<D>__{will you listen to me? please listen to me!}
<A>__{several lunatics are gathered around tormenting him, one of them yanking on his penis as if it were made of rubber; another is playing with his ass. a third one, also in a leather kiyis, is leaning over max jabbering and drooling into his face. max, more enraged by this than the other bodily offences, lunges up sharply and bites the man's face. screams, etc. billy, paying no attention except for a brief disinterested glance, keeps going into: a second room. more lunatics. a screaming old man is chasing after another old man who has stolen his tespe beads, waving them back at the first old man who howls with rage, frantic to have his beads back. the second old man throws the beads to a third old man who hops across the beds with the first old man chasing him. billy intersects.}

<D>__{allah! allah! yok! yok! yok! brack!}
<A>__{a little nervous man stares into a broken pocket mirror fingering the large round carbuncle under his eye, trying to rub it away with little grimaces and flurries of nervous motion. two attendants in smocks indifferently finish eating on a newspaper spread across one of the beds; they shake out the paper. chicken bones, orange peels hitting the floor. a flurry of movement, as the lunatics scuffle like rats over the left overs. ad lib curses, yells. an old man obscenely gestures to billy from his bed.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{hey american. fik! fick! come. fik! fik!}
<A>__{his blackened teeth leer. billy, seemingly immune to all of this in some private island of his own madness, walks in his determined way past a partition to: a circular stone staircase leading downwards, the stones damp, dark, slippery. billy continues with the same straight ahead determination to: a loner level. at last billy's expression changes to almost childish relief, for here at last is the refuge he seeks the relative comfort and silence of the wheel. it is a grim, squat pillar dominating the room and bearing the weight of the ceiling. and around it some sixty lunatics trudge slowly, near silently, in counter clockwise flow. it is a hypnotic shuffle and billy blends right in, sliding easily into the sluggish, mindless river, his eyes hanging loosely on the floor, watching: the soothing rhythm of feet shuffling at a comforting pace. these are the spokes of the wheel.}
