<L>__{interior locker room day}
<A>__{cynthia, in her bathrobe, wanders out of the shower in between the dark, steamy rows of lockers. she passes lana and miriam. miriam is dressing, and lana is putting on a swimsuit.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{nothing like a hot shower, huh?}
<A>__{cynthia doesn't hear or see them. she settles on the far end of the bench. she sits there blankly. lana nears, with great trepidation.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{cynthia? cynthia? are you okay?}
<A>__{cynthia looks up.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{are you all right? after that session today, i }
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<A>__{cynthia starts to dress, ignoring lana. lana stands there for a moment, very awkwardly.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{i think... you're a decent person... not a... mean spirited witch like some people...}
<A>__{she thrown a look at miriam, who just smiles pleasantly.}
<C>__{lana }
<D>__{ and, well, if you need a friend here...}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(distant tone)}
<D>__{all my friends are dead.}
<A>__{rattled, lana backs off, on the verge of tears, rushing past miriam, who has observed all this.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{lana, wait a minute, she didn't mean it shit.}
<A>__{miriam closes her locker and comes over to cynthia.}
<C>__{miriam }
<D>__{i know lana's a mealy mouthed little prude, but she means well. i probably pull her chain too much... she's reaching out, like all of us. try and help her.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i can't even help myself.}
<A>__{miriam looks at her, puzzled, then exits the locker room, heading back to the ward. beyond the lockers, through a doorway, we see lana lowering herself into the pool. blue ripples line the wall beyond.}
<C>__{distant voices}
<P>__{(echo affect)}
<D>__{be cleansed!}
<A>__{the sound of the voices unnerves cynthia. she presses her hands against her forehand in pain. we are tight on cynthia. we hear splashing.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{cleanse the heart of your mind.}
<A>__{a bright white light melts across cynthia's face. she looks up. something draws her forward. cynthia side angle she begins walking, passing behind clothes racks and lockers. then, somehow, the shadows of these things become the shadows of trees, and then cynthia is}
<B>__{on a broad field}
<A>__{which leads down to a pond. twenty or so people are gathered at the edge of the water. we see the unity house in the distance. cynthia moves behind a tree to watch. harris stands waist deep in the pond. the unity house members all sit or stand on the shore. harris holds his hands out in a gesture. a girl comes forward through the group out into the water. it is cynthia, the younger cynthia, with long hair in a braid. she smiles at harris as she nears him. he clutches her hands. behind the tree, cynthia watches "herself," absorbed. harris looks into cynthia's eyes. he touches her face.}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{cynthia. you are part of the whole.}
<A>__{he grabs her by the back of the head and plunges her violently under water.}
<C>__{harris }
<D>__{cleanse the heart of the mind!}
<A>__{he yanks her up. she smiles exultantly. he dunks her back down.}
<C>__{harris }
<D>__{cleanse the soul of the self!}
<A>__{he yanks her up again, but it's not cynthia. it's lana. before she can catch her breath, she's plunged back down. lana closer she's yanked up, but this time she's not in the pond, she's in that gasoline filled cistern!}
<C>__{harris }
<D>__{cleanse the spirit of the body!}
<A>__{he holds her under. she starts to move her arms around to grab hold of something to pull herself up, but harris is too strong. she flails around desperately.}
<B>__{cynthia}
<A>__{alarmed, she moves forward with lana under water}
<C>__{harris }
<P>__{(distant)}
<D>__{cleanse the spirit.}
<A>__{lana's gasping, inhaling water, turning blue. harris is possessed.}
<C>__{harris }
<D>__{cleanse.}
<A>__{her movements slow. her eyes close. she is completely still. harris close he looks directly at cynthia.}
<C>__{harris }
<D>__{i warned you, cynthia. i warned you someone else would take your place.}
<B>__{under water again}
<A>__{his hand withdraws from lana. her eyes open. no life there.}
<B>__{she floats upwards. the camera breaks the surface of the water with her.}
<A>__{we're in the clinic's swimming pool! on the edge of the pool, cynthia screams, drops to her knees in horror.}
<B>__{other end of building}
<A>__{the clinic custodian and some staff run into the room. swimming pool high angle someone wades out to lana's body, drags it to the concrete deck, tries futilely to pump life back into it. across the pool, cynthia flails at the people trying to help her.}
