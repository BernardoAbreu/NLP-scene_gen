<L>__{interior therapy room day}
<A>__{camera pans past a row of pillows. we widen, see that each member of the group has a big pillow in front of them.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{okay. first off, we're all going to feel a little silly and maybe look a little silly...}
<C>__{ralph}
<P>__{(a la groucho)}
<D>__{especially in that shirt you're wearing, goldman...}
<A>__{new angle favoring cynthia she sits, looking very distracted. as alan continues speaking, he occasionally looks at her, but to her relief deliberately doesn't single her out.}
<C>__{alan}
<P>__{(amused, but pushing on)}
<D>__{ but this technique works, and we're going to release some of our hidden aggression. who's going to go first? lana?}
<C>__{lana}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{how many helpless goose had to die to fill those stupid pillows?}
<C>__{alan}
<P>__{(as everyone groans)}
<D>__{none, lana. they're polyester. ed? want to start?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{nah. let's talk about the geese again. nice fat ones, with all the trimmings }
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{all right, how about if we all start together and eliminate the wimp factor. come on.}
<A>__{he starts pounding his pillow with a steady beat. gradually, self consciously, the others join in except for cynthia.}
<C>__{alan }
<P>__{(standing, walking around the circle)}
<D>__{okay. what are we feeling?}
<C>__{connie}
<P>__{(as she pounds)}
<D>__{we used to do something like this in the royal palace in atlantis. but we used bags of dried kelp.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{your brain is a bag of dried kelp }
<C>__{alan}
<P>__{(chiding)}
<D>__{ralph. miriam?}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(pounding)}
<D>__{i'm pretending this is my first husband... no, maybe my third...}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{can i have a baseball bat?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{please, people, let's work at being serious.}
<A>__{he moves behind cynthia, who's still unmoving. leans close, whispers.}
<C>__{alan }
<D>__{i know you had a rough night. but you have to participate.}
<A>__{she sighs, starts to pound the pillow. at first she's very distracted, but then she gets into an unconscious rhythm... group quick shots all of them are finally and legitimately exorcising personal demons.}
<C>__{alan }
<D>__{okay, that's better. now let's hear some emotion. let it out. yell! scream!}
<A>__{miriam gives a very theatrical scream. there's some laughter, but others try, too. gilda begins to give little angry yelps. ralph is really punching some ancient enemy. connie does a respectable if modest scream. ed snarls with more anger than we'd expect.}
<B>__{cynthia}
<A>__{begins hitting the pillow with growing strength. her eyes are far away. she begins to breathe heavily. camera tightens on her. she closes her eyes. when she opens them, she reacts to }
