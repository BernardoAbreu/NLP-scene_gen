<D>__{present company included.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{so i'm a fanatic.}
<C>__{elise}

<C>__{hub}
<D>__{is that right?}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{so why're are you a fed?}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{that's what my nephew keeps asking me. "why you with the man, unc?"}

<C>__{hub}
<D>__{you believe in anything, elise ?}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{like what, for instance?}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{how about right and wrong?}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{it's easy to choose between right and wrong. what's hard is choosing the wrong that's more right. i just want to make it all... a little... better.}
<P>__{(finishes her drink)}
<D>__{ignore me. i'm shitfaced.}
<A>__{frank appears to lean over their table.}

<A>__{she laughs and stands up to dance:}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{what do you say, hub...? peace?}
<A>__{but as he grudgingly stands up, a ballad comes on. they stand there awkwardly. finally, he takes her into his arms.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{this feels like high school.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{ only my prom date wasn't packing a gun.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{mine's a 9 mm. how big is yours?}
<C>__{hub}

<D>__{so what's the latest from samir. i want a list of every visa he sponsored.}
<C>__{elise}

<C>__{hub}
<D>__{i once knew this undercover guy, started to care so much about his source }
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{ samir's a source. period.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{have you considered that he might also be in bed with the other side?}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{samir in bed with them? that would too much to wish for.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{you're so confident.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{only in bed.}
<A>__{tina watches them. she rolls her eyes at frank. and then:}
<B>__{the ground shakes}
<A>__{a low rumble as the light flickers and the chandelier sways.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{whoa... what do they put in these drinks ?}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{they got earthquakes in manhattan?}
<A>__{but elise is not too drunk to make her way to the door. hub joins her. already, in the distance, the wailing of sirens. in the town car speeding uptown on madison ave blue light flashing. hub, elise and frank sit grimly silent.}
<B>__{traffic}
<A>__{is snarled and gridlocked at 40th. finally, they can take it no longer and step out into a chorus of honking horns.}
<B>__{they begin to run}
<A>__{past the frustrated drivers. turning the corner at 41st where:}
<B>__{smoke billows}
<A>__{from the new victory theatre where a gala benefit is taking place.}
<B>__{girl in a prada gown}
<A>__{walks toward camera. she's stunning. from the jeweled clutchbag to the tasteful necklace, everything is perfect, except:}
<B>__{her right arm is missing}
<A>__{and now we see: the black and whites haphazardly pulled up over the steps and the firetrucks already unspooling their hoses. cops, firemen, emt's. everybody's screaming. hub and elise race past.}
<B>__{man in black tie}
<A>__{sits, weeping quietly beneath the once proud stone lions.}
<B>__{the few survivors}
<A>__{their faces cut and bleeding, stumble around, disoriented. as hub and elise continue toward a sound we have never heard before in this country. a kind of keening. a nypd sergeant is the senior officer on the scene. hub shows his shield to the man who appears a bit shell shocked.}
<C>__{nypd sergeant}
<D>__{ fucking bastards waited 'til intermission. everybody standing around... oh, jesus...}
<A>__{glass crunching underfoot, they can only watch as horribly disfigured bodies are carried out. a news reporter shoves a microphone in hub's face.}
<C>__{news reporter}
<D>__{is it true the governor was attending tonight's benefit ?}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{news reporter}
<D>__{who it is i'm speaking to ?}
<A>__{hub ignores the reporter. he sees that elise is already tearing off part of her skirt to bandage a society matron. he takes off his coat and goes to work beside her.}
