<A>__{the sound has drawn the attention of barry (10) lying in bed. he moves up and stares out the window sees the broken glass in the courtyard. he scans up the building and spots a figure standing on the roof. rooftop wider chilling april air flutters angela's gown, vaporizes her breath. tears stream down her cheeks as she contemplates the unthinkable. cityscape of lights are spread out below but angela is seeing something else. reflected in her eyes is a city engulfed in red flames. follow that tear with the same reflection of fire inside as it traces her cheek and slips into her mouth. angela shudders, rubs her wrist where we see the skin has swelled and reddened just like the prisoner's. and there's that same circular symbol in the flesh. she wipes her tears tries to be strong. takes a few breaths for courage, them simply steps off.}
