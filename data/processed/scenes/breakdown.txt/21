<A>__{a modest apartment in the back bay neighborhood. not much furniture, but lots of books and cd's. on the walls, blow ups of arty photographs amy in modeling poses, plus many black and white scenery stills. jeff's bag is unopened on the floor. we see two nearly full wine glasses on a table. the camera tracks down a hallway to the open bedroom door.}
