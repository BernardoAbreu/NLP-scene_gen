<L>__{ext north road sunset}
<A>__{from a lookout position above, a cowboy calls down to the others:}
<D>__{4th cowboy riders comin'.}
<A>__{behan heaves a sigh of relief, glancing around at the others.}
<C>__{behan}
<D>__{well i guess ringo did it.}
<A>__{but suddenly ringo's seconds gallop up from the flank:}
<D>__{3rd cowboy ringo's dead}
<C>__{behan}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{straining to see in the falling light, the cowboy on the rock shouts excitedly:}
<D>__{4th cowboy that's wyatt earp's bunch!}
<A>__{the word starts to spread, the crowd of horsemen buzzing. suddenly, off in the distance, the 4 horsemen come into view, coming straight at them at a lope.}
<D>__{3rd cowboy they're comin' right at us!}
<A>__{down the road, wyatt asnd his men pull their shotguns, holding them at the ready as they break into a gallop. the cowboy on the rock jumps down, mounting his horse.}
<D>__{4th cowboy here they come! get ready...}
<A>__{the cowboys line up on a rise, blocking the road. they draw their guns. wyatt and his men keep coming, now 200 yards away. behan groans, panic sinking sour and heavy, churning his bowels:}
<C>__{behan}
<D>__{oh, no...}
<A>__{now wyatt's men break into a dead run, hurtling toward them at top speed, their thoroughbreds eating up the distance, now only 100 yards away. the cowboys tense up more and more, biting lips, grinding teeth. the 4th cowboy turns to the nearby 3rd cowboy:}
<D>__{4th cowboy what d'you think? 3rd cowboy i think it's time to start workin' for a livin'.}
<C>__{behan}
<D>__{me too!}
<A>__{they break and run. so does another. suddenly the whole mass of them explodes in panic with horsemen riding in all directions, scurrying away like cockroaches from a light. ike looks around, screaming at them, beside himself as the 4th cowboy rides by:}
<C>__{ike}
<D>__{kill 'em! kill 'em! it's only four men! why don't you kill 'em? 4th cowboy why don't you?}
<A>__{the others keep going, leaving him behind. but seeing wyatt bearing down on him, ike finally bolts himself, pounding off hell for leather into the hills. wyatt and his men keep coming at a full gallop and as they crest the rise, suddenly, as before, the ground seems to fall out from under them and for another burning moment they once again appear airborne, grim faced avenging angels on winged horses, now even more majestic in the twilight, like a myth made flesh, awesome, superb, and unutterably beautiful. as they approach, only breakenridge remains, giving them a tentative wave. wyatt points a finger at him as they ride by in a flash, cresting another rise and passing into legend....}
