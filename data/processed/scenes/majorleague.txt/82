<L>__{exterior lynn's apartment night}
<A>__{lynn comes up the stairs, unlocks the apartment door and steps inside. there's no particular urgency. she feels sure she's shaken taylor. the apartment is full of packing boxes. tired from the chase, lynn drops her bag on a box and slumps down on the couch. it's obvious she's not all that happy to have lost taylor. she goes to the window and looks down to the street for some sign of him. seeing nothing, she turns away from the window disappointed, and starts back to the couch, when something stops her. it's taylor, standing in the doorway.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{whose place are we at this time?}
<C>__{lynn}
<P>__{(flustered)}
<D>__{mine. you follow me again?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{yeh. when i saw you at the game, i figured you wanted to see me about something.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i just wanted to see you play.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{how was i?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{you looked good, but you oughta open your stance a little. they're pitchin' you inside.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i will try that.}
<A>__{taylor gives a perfunctory nod. they look at each other a second. there's still plenty there. taylor begins to come toward her. we hear his cleats on the floor. she backs off, but not with real conviction.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i think i oughta tell you that i'm moving in with tom.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{goin' uptown, huh?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i'm not goin' uptown, i just want to lead a regular life. you know, like an adult maybe. with a house and a garden and normal hours.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{you think i can't lead a regular life?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{you like the life you've had, jake. you like hangin' out with the boys, livin' in hotels, eatin' dinner at midnight, having girls send you their underwear in the mail. remember the surprise party i threw for you when you made the all star team? you never showed up, but the doorbell rang once and we all got quiet and hid behind the furniture. it was a guy to serve you with a paternity suit.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{that was a hoax. the girl was just trying to get some publicity.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{yes, but you had obviously been with her. and it happened in front of all our friends.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i was drownin', lynn. the endorsements were dryin' up, my knees were goin', they were talkin' about sendin' me down. i was just trying to hold on to somethin', prove to myself i was still an all star. i don't care about that anymore. i know i don't have much time left in baseball. i'm just a guy trying to put his life back together. thinkin' about you was the only thing that kept me goin' in mexico.}
<A>__{lynn looks at him a long beat.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i've come back to you too many times, jake. i can't afford to believe you anymore.}
<A>__{lynn is backed up against a desk now. she could move out but doesn't.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i guess this is our last hurrah then.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i guess so. did you really read "moby dick?"}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{cover to cover.}
<A>__{taylor comes forward to kiss her, tentatively at first. their conversation is interwoven with the slowly deepening intensity of their kissing.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{when's the wedding?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{october third.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{your mom and dad like this guy?}
<C>__{lynn}

<A>__{they're unbuttoning each other's shirts now.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{gonna be a big wedding?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{tom doesn't like big weddings. you coulda read plot outlines of 101 great novels.}

<C>__{taylor}

<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{the zipper on your skirt is stuck.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{use your imagination.}
<A>__{taylor's spikes come down across her skirt, catching in the material, ripping it from her body and pinning it to the wood floor. taylor steps out of the shoe and whisks lynn out of frame. we hold on the skirt, nailed to the floor by the cleats.}
