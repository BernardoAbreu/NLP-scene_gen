<A>__{a tapestry rug is pulled away, and pedro's head appears. he climbs out and soon all the party is in the church. a priest leads them quickly through an immense, nearly. european interior of ornate altars and burning candles. the small party is led to a small corner of the sanctuary where a long, rickety ladder leads up to the roof. the sandinistas scramble up the ladder as it sways. pedro follows with his sack of contact bombs. then price goes up as the priest holds the ladder. the american is much larger than the nicaraguans the ladder squeaks and sways, and when he is nearly at the top: the ladder cracks as price reaches the top and is helped to safety. the priest steadies the ladder now made unsafe and clearly claire wants to go onto the roof.}
