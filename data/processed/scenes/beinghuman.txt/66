<A>__{the priest makes his way upstairs in the darkness. he yawns, a long, contented yawn. he has completed the hardest day's work that he has undertaken as a priest, if he really is a priest. if he is not, then the pre tence has been just as exhausting. he wants to sleep.}

<A>__{in the room sleeping forms lie here and there in the darkness. some officers have moved in and the place is more crowded than before. the priest makes his way to his corner, but on the way he pauses by beatrice. she snores lightly. the priest bends over and takes a long sniff at her, then he sighs out his admiration. he steps over her and settles into his own space by the window. he suddenly misses the presence of hector. he looks again at beatrice, still and sleeping. what the priest doesn't see is the extra pair of hands massaging her neck and head. she moans softly in her pretence of sleep. the priest is troubled, suspicious, but he doesn't know why. he sniffs again, in the general direction of beatrice. the mingled smells that his sensitive nose detects perplex him, but he settles down, pulling his cloak over his head. across the room, hector's head emerges from the covering beside beatrice. they make love quietly in the dark, also enjoying the thrill of confounding the priest.}
