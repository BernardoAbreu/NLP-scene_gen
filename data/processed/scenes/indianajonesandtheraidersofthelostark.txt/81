<A>__{sallah, sweating profusely, has finished serving the line of breakfasting germans and now heads back to replace the kettle and get away.}

<A>__{indy is on his knees at the miniature city, a special tape measure in his hand. indy has the tape strung from belloq's mistaken spot to his own correct spot. he gets his reading, leaps up and crosses to the erect staff. he pulls the headpiece off the staff and hides it in his robes. he quickly breaks the wooden staff in two and throws the pieces behind a pile of debris. then he moves quickly to beneath the skylight.}

<D>__{sallah.}
<P>__{(he waits, then louder)}
<D>__{sallah!}
<A>__{more waiting. nothing. indy looks around for some alternative means of escape. the room doesn't offer any. he looks up at the skylight again.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(loudest)}
<D>__{sallah!}
<A>__{a long pause. then something comes down. a makeshift rope. really just a bunch of clothing tied together tunics, robes, pants. but what we see first and most prominently, the first section of indy's escape rope, is a bright nazi flag. indy beams and climbs.}
