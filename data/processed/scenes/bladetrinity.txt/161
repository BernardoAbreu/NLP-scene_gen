<C>__{asher}
<D>__{his name's beau. we've been experimenting with porting the vampire gene over into other species.}

<D>__{poor little king. you look so distraught.}

<C>__{grinwood}
<D>__{spit it out, you fucking fruitcake!}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{okay, here's the deal with the weapon }
<P>__{(coughing)}
<D>__{it's a new flavor crystal formula. twice the chocolaty goodness, half the calories. plus, it helps prevent tooth decay }
