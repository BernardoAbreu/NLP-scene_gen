<L>__{exterior ray's trailer yard, massena new york day}
<A>__{ray eddy, 38, a bit worn for her years, with a long red ponytail, wearing an old bathrobe, sits in the passenger seat of her red plymouth horizon with the door open, smoking a cigarette, thinking. her breath is visible in the cold morning air. her bare feet rest on the cold ground. her 1970's rusted out trailer home sits in front of her on cinder blocks at a slight tilt. beside it, a small shed and behind it the concrete foundation for a house. around her, the yard is littered with junk: a rusted ski lift chair, the front end of a plymouth duster and a smiling duck kiddie ride. beyond the yard, flat, winterbare land. after a moment, a lanky boy of 15, her son, troy, jr., leans out the trailer door.}
<C>__{t.j.}

<A>__{t.j. looks in at the open and empty glove compartment.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{that was stupid.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah, i see that now, but the trucks were coming before the bank opened.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{did you tell him you had it?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{duh? no, i guess he just sniffed it out.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{jesus christ! the glove compartment!? that's the stupidest place you could have put it.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{he hasn't bought a scratch card in almost thirty two months. i thought it would be okay!}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{did he leave anything?}
<A>__{she shakes her head.}
<C>__{t.j. }
<D>__{what are you gonna do?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{you could look for him?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{he could be anywhere.}

<C>__{ray}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{t.j.}

<D>__{so let's go, let's find him before he blows it all.}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i just can't do it anymore.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{but he'll lose it all.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{t.j., we can't make him stop.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{he stole our money. call the troopers.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{it's not stealing if you take it from your family. anyway, he made some of it, too.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{so you're just gonna sit there?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{in the distance the rumble of trucks. ray hears it. it gets louder.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{another christmas in the tin crapper.}
<A>__{t.j. goes into the shed and slams the door. ray throws down her cigarette and goes into the trailer.}
