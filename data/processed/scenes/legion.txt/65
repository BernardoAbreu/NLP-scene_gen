<L>__{exterior paradise falls gas 'n' grub roof late afternoon}
<A>__{sand and wind. the invisible sun is sinking. kyle and audrey are bundled together on the roof, keeping watch. kyle is showing her how to hold the mp5.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{...then you just flip this }
<A>__{audrey flips the safety.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{yeah, i got it. all the way down. two clicks.}
<A>__{she points the gun out into the haze like she's been holding one all her life. off kyle's surprised look:}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{dated this guy last summer. a marine. had a thing for guns. parents hated him.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{i bet they did.}
<A>__{after a moment, audrey switches the safety back on. hands the gun over to kyle. audrey stares into the red nothingness surrounding them. her expression growing distant. she seems to have aged years overnight.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{my parents hate everything i do. that's why we were moving.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{they thought a more "wholesome" environment would help me "change my ways." so fucked up. only reason they care at all is cuz they don't want to be embarrassed in front of their friends at the country club.}
<A>__{kyle considers her thoughtfully.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{the only time my old man ever paid attention to me was when i was doing somethin' bad. so you know what i did?}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{i got really good at being bad.}
<A>__{she smiles at this confession. can obviously relate. he wipes a tear from her cheek. she leans in. kisses him. passionately. desperately. his hands trace over her body. she claws at him. her passion growing out of control. she's practically devouring him. kyle can barely keep up. it's like something else beyond sensual need has taken over. she moves down his chest. further. kyle leans his head back. further. just then the spot lights that illuminate the roof sign come to life. the young couple stops to look up at the brilliant red word "paradise" illuminated above them. down below, the gas pumps light up. the station's fluorescents flicker on.}
