<A>__{follow davies as he runs up to the gun deck with the shot under his arms past the powder monkeys addison and swift, canisters of gun powder slung over their shoulders, then he sees mr. lamb, the carpenter.}
<C>__{davies}
<D>__{orlop! we're holed!}
<A>__{as lamb dives for the ladder.}
<L>__{46. on the gun deck}
<A>__{davies arrives to find a gaping hole opposite where his own gun once stood. its crew lie scattered, horribly wounded or dead. the dismounted gun and twelve pound shot are rolling around dangerously. hollom, the sole survivor, is backed against the bulkhead, cradling an injured arm. calamy emerges from the smoke, meets davies's horror struck gaze and takes command.}
<C>__{calamy}
<D>__{davies! get those bodies overboard!}
<P>__{(to hollom)}
<D>__{mr. hollom sir!}
<A>__{hollom sits immobilized by fear. calamy grabs the poulterer, jemmy ducks, who has been rescuing the ship's goat, aspasia.}
<C>__{calamy }
<D>__{jemmy leave the damned goat and take mr. hollom below.}
<C>__{jemmy ducks}
<D>__{aye, sir!}
<A>__{the ship heels as she turns. midshipman blakeney, calamy's rival in the game of marbles, turns to see the dismounted gun rolling free. he throws a hammock net under it, stopping its roll before it crushes calamy against the bulkhead. calamy shoots him a brief look of gratitude and runs aft. blakeney carries on shouting to the powder monkeys }
<C>__{blakeney}
<D>__{more shot! more cartridge!}
