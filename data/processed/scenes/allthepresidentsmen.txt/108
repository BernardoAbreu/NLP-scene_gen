<B>__{the hunt for dahlberg.}
<A>__{this is a compressed montage sequence in which we cut : from one reporter to the other, both of them desperately trying to locate a man names dahlberg. woodward is maybe in the reference room of the post, sweating, surrounded by who's who and dictionary of american biographies and phone books from dozens and dozens of cities bernstein is maybe in the phone booth of the justice building, sweating, with a pile of dimes as he dials away. this took them hours, and that effort should be visible to us. they tire, grow punchy, but they keep on, checking phone book and dialing numbers and god knows what else. the point is, we want to get to dahlberg in a reasonably short amount of time, but we also want people to know there was effort involved.}
