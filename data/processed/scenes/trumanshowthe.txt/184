<L>__{exterior soundstage. dusk.}
<A>__{truman finds himself on the roof of the soundstage. outside. really outside for the first time in his life. he looks frantically around him. nowhere to hide. the soundstage stretches for miles in both directions as far as the eye can see, an interminable expanse of roof. facing him, a colossal burbank. several other soundstages almost as gigantic as his own. the palm trees lining the streets, dwarfed by the mammoth barns. the hollywood freeway in the distance, carrying its ribbons of traffic, twenty lanes wide. gargantuan office buildings eclipse any skyscraper truman has ever known. directly below him, a dizzying drop to the studio lot and its arched entranceway. above him, a large yellow moon in the twilight sky. the real moon, not the planetarium projection he has been contemplating for the last thirty four years. truman wheels around, suddenly realizing he is not alone. a group has emerged on the rooftop, standing still and silent in a semi circle, cutting off any escape. along with the studio guards, keeping their distance in the background, are chloe, simeon, and the two studio executives, moses and roman. in front of them, the co stars in his life marlon, meryl, sister raquel, mother audrey and supposedly dead father kirk. no one moves or speaks as truman scans the familiar faces. marlon, in particular, cannot look him in the eye. truman's gaze finally falls on the white haired old man standing at the head of the group. christof. he approaches truman alone, carrying a white envelope, calling his name the way a father calls to a son.}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{truman...}
<A>__{truman seems to sense the significance christof has had in his life, drawn to and repelled by him at the same time. as they stand together looking into each other's eyes for the first time, they seem to be the only two figures on the roof. for a moment truman averts his gaze to the night sky.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(quietly, half to himself, half to christof)}
<D>__{even the stars i wished on...}
<A>__{as truman turns his attention back to christof, he suddenly lunges at him, catching him off guard, the envelope slipping from christof's hand. with a strength he never knew he possessed, truman forces christof to the edge of the soundstage roof, threatening to throw them both off his counterfeit world. christof clings desperately to truman to save himself. the studio guards dare not move.}
<C>__{christof}
<P>__{(staring into the chasm, remaining eerily calm)}
<D>__{you won't do it, truman. i've watched you your whole life.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(meeting christof's gaze)}
<D>__{you never had a camera in my head.}
<A>__{suddenly the doubts flood into christof's eyes, fearing he has misjudged truman, fearing for his life.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(incensed)}
<D>__{something was real!}
<P>__{(a terrifying anguish)}
<D>__{something had to be real!}
<A>__{it takes all of truman's will not to hurl the old man into the abyss. christof, petrified, looks to the pristine, white envelope that lies half over the edge of the roof, glinting in the moonlight. truman follows christof's gaze. contemptuously tossing christof aside, he retrieves the envelope. christof crawls to safety, thankful to still be alive, suddenly appearing very small and insignificant. but christof and the other figures on the rooftop no longer exist in truman's mind. truman gazes at his name for a long moment, handwritten on the envelope in blue ink, then carefully breaks the seal. truman allows the sole item in the envelope to be slowly revealed. a photograph. a close up of sylvia's face including her eyes, mouth and that perfect, ever elusive nose. a serenity comes over truman. he lifts up his eyes to the mountains on the far horizon. as he stands on the very edge of the soundstage roof without fear, clutching the photograph, we commence a long, slow pull back. truman is unaware that directly beneath his feet on the wall of the enormous soundstage is a billboard acrrying a gigantic picture of his face and proclaiming, "truman total record of a human life. 34th great year!" we continue to pull back until truman is nothing but a speck on top of the soundstage so large it never completely clears frame.}
<B>__{a montage of various locations}
<A>__{the two old women in the living room, the nightwatchmen, the two young men with the watchman tv, the patrons in the bar, passers by outside an electronics store are all captivated by their television sets. we focus on the screen of a television. a small female baby sucks a toy on a blanket in the backyard of truman's old suburban home in queens, the lawn he mowed for ten years of his life. the infant's doting parents, marlon and the new actress vivien, enter frame and begin to fuss over the child. a border around the action on the screen announces, "zoe total record of a human life". suddenly we see a child's hand on top of the television screen. a baby stands unsteadily, supporting herself against the television set in sylvia's house. truman bends down and picks up his baby, tossing her into the air, much to the child's delight. truman dwells for a moment on the mirror image scene on the television before very deliberately shutting it off. sylvia joins truman and their daughter. together, they exit the beach house. we follow them as they make their way onto the deserted sand and down towards the sea.}
