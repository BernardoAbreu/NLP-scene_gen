<L>__{interior infirmary later}
<A>__{sam 1's eyes pop open, he is awake, staring directly at gerty.}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{hello sam.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{how are you feeling?}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{where am i?}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{the infirmary. you had an accident out by one of the harvesters. do you remember?}
<A>__{for a second this is playing out like the other infirmary scene. a case of deja vu. sam 1's eyes twitch as he catalogues through his memory. yes he remembers the crash. he remembers something else, too.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{i saw someone out there, gerty.}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{who did you see, sam?}
<A>__{just then sam 1 notices the other sam the more current, clean shaven sam who we will now refer to as sam 2. he is standing against the wall watching sam 1.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{i saw a girl.}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{you saw a girl out by the harvester? how is that possible?}
<A>__{sam 1 continues to stare at sam 2, hardly believing his eyes.}
<C>__{gerty }
<D>__{sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries, but all in all the prognosis is good. i'm happy to see you again.}
<A>__{as he says this sam 2 crosses slowly from one side of the room to the other, never taking his eyes off sam 1. it's like sam 2 is purposefully keeping his distance, reluctant, afraid even, to approach any closer. meanwhile sam 1 is beginning to look spooked.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{gerty?}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{yes, sam?}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{is there someone in the room with us?}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{who is he?}
<A>__{but sam 1 knows exactly who it is. he's seen that face every morning of his life in the bathroom mirror.}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{sam, get some sleep. you're very tired.}
<A>__{sam 2 wordlessly walks out of the room. sam 1's eyes shift to gerty, the spooked expression yet to leave his face.}
