<L>__{ext back roads, park morning}
<A>__{muldoon and workers drive rapidly in the jeep. suddenly, muldoon slams on the brakes. muldoon's pov about twenty procompsognathids (compys), small chicken sized scavenging dinosaurs, scramble across the road.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{where the hell are they going?}
<A>__{muldoon watches them cross. he thinks it over. spins the wheel and follows them off the road.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{let's see what's up.}
<L>__{ext below the tree, park morning}
<A>__{timmy bravely jumps from a very low branch. he smiles and looks at grant, who's already on the ground. grant looks off in the distance.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{tim, i think there's a motion sensor across the field and down there.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{where's lex?}
<A>__{alone in the bushes lex kneels. she holds a big fruit and calls:}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{c'mere boy, c'mere.}
<A>__{she tosses the fruit. close on the fruit rolling away. lex gets up and follows the rolling fruit. she picks it up.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{it's very, very good.}
<A>__{she tosses it again.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{c'mere boy, c'mere.}
<A>__{lex's eyes scan the bushes, then stop. she smiles. lex's pov hidden in the brush, a baby triceratops' eye peeks at lex. lex pushes the fruit closer. the baby triceratops comes out of the brush, squeaking as it goes. it nibbles the fruit. lex rolls another. back on grant and tim they look around. timmy stops, mouth open, yells:}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{dr. grant, dr. grant, look.}
<A>__{grant turns, looks offscreen. he's astonished by when he sees. his pov a row of shrubs, which lex seems to soar above. as a break in the shrubs, it's clear that she's riding the baby triceratops. loving it.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{whoa!}
<A>__{with a whoop, grant and timmy chase after lex on her triceratops. lex rides through low brush, ducking down as she goes. then beneath the tall trees as she enters the forest. she crosses a stream on a log b ridge. light showers down through the branches. the water shimmers. lex in is paradise. behind her, grant and timmy shout for her to stop. she waves, kicks the triceratops like it's a horse and yells:}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{giddyup!}
<A>__{the trike takes off, in a rush. it trips over a fallen tree, downed by the storm. the trike takes a spill and lex goes flying.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{whoa!! take is easy!}
<A>__{she passes over the trike's head, in the air, and screams as she flies:}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i can't swim!}
<A>__{she splashes into the stream. timmy, first to arrive on the scene, dives in heroically. he comes up sheepish and muddy and sees lex standing in a foot of water. the baby dinosaur rolls to a stop, mowing down a patch of saplings as she goes. it stands up, dizzy and out of breath. timmy wipes mud off himself. grant helps the kids out of the water. the baby triceratops follows them. grant yells to the baby trike.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{go home now. home to freda!}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{oh, let him stay. he likes me to ride him. he could carry me instead of you, dr. grant. please, let him stay,}
<A>__{grant shakes his head,}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{go! go away. go! get out of here!}
<A>__{the trike whimpers and watches the three of them walk on. lex is heartbroken.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{will i ever play with him again?}
<A>__{grant looks across the field, abundantly beautiful in the early morning. he has to keep them going. he points across the field.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{we gotta get to that motion detector. it's still a ways.}
<A>__{lex looks behind her. in the distance, more hadrosaurs join the herd eating from the tall trees. some cool off in a shallow lagoon. they drink, lowering their flat heads, meeting their own reflections in the still water. when they look up again, their heads swivel. at the water's edge, a baby hadrosaur ventures out, squeaks, and scrambles back while the adults watch indulgently.}
