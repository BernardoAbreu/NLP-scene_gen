<A>__{ecu of grace's eyes as her head is pulled back into frame. her eyes are wide with fear. the camera pulls back to reveal a gag in her mouth and a knife pressed against her throat. she's back at the night of the murder. mickey's wearing a black leather jacket over a white t shirt, which is covered with blood. blood is smeared on his face, and he's holding a knife pressed to his lips, also covered with blood. but he's walking and talking with the same manner and poise as in the courtroom.}
