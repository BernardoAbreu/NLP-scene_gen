<L>__{interior asakawas apartment living room night}
<A>__{asakawa walks slowly, dreamily forward. she drops the videotape loudly onto the coffee table and slouches into a chair. her eyes fall to the framed photographs of yoichi on one of the shelves. this snaps asakawa out of her daze and she begins whispering intently to herself, thinking.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{i was the only one to break sadakos curse. ryuji... why...? something i did that you didnt... something i did that you didnt...}
<A>__{asakawa gives up, lowers her face into her hands. when she looks up again, she happens to glance at the television screen and its glare reveals that there is someone else in the room with her. it is the figure from the videotape, the silent accuser with the cloth draped over its face. with a start, asakawa realizes that the figure is wearing ryujis clothes.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{ryuji?!}
<A>__{she spins around, but the room is empty. asakawas mind races. the figure had been pointing towards her bag. she stands, rummages in her bag to produce her copy of the cursed videotape. she takes ryujis copy in her other hand, her eyes darting between the two tapes.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{something i did that you didnt...}
<A>__{it suddenly clicks home as asakawa looks full on at ryujis version of the tape, plainly marked copy.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{what broke the curse was that i copied the tape and showed it to someone else!}
