<A>__{blackness. we hear:}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{ready?}
<C>__{second voice }
<D>__{yeah. boot it.}
<A>__{a burst of bright white static exploding across the darkness. a high whine on the audio track gives way to street sounds and rapid breathing. an image wavers and stabilizes: a nervous pov. we're in a car, sitting in the backseat, and we're nervous, the view swinging around, showing the street rolling by outside the windows, then whipping back to the two guys in the front seat. our pov looks down at a small recording device in "our" hands. a red led is flashing. we slip the recorder into a coat pocket.}
<C>__{our voice}
<D>__{okay. it's goin'. i'm recording.}
<A>__{the guy riding shotgun, lane, is just pulling a pantyhose over his head, smearing his features into a pig like mask. he turns, directly to the lens, pissed off.}
<C>__{lane}
<D>__{good one, dickhead. thanks for waitin' till i get this fuckin thing on. you tryin' ta i.d. me, or what?}
<A>__{he tosses another pantyhose right at us and we catch it. our pov looks down, into the pantyhose, which comes up over our field of view. we realize: this is not some ride along verite video. we are one of these guys. real honest to god point of view, with no cuts, no music. this is not film, it is human experience. the driver is a hispanic guy named "spaz" diaz. lane is a white guy who looks very strung out. couple of crackheads. the car is a mid seventies barge, piebald with primer.}
<C>__{lane}
<D>__{next alley... just pull in slow.}
<P>__{(turning to us)}
<D>__{hurry up will ya. here.}
<A>__{he hands us a big stainless steel revolver. the pov looks down as our shaky hands snap open the cylinder, check the rounds, snap it closed. diaz pulls the barge into an alley. the headlights illuminate overflowing dumpsters. a chicano busboy is making trash runs out the back door of a restaurant, which he has chocked open. the busboy goes back inside.}
<C>__{lane}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{out of the car, quickly, our own breathing loud in our ears. we even hear our own heartbeat, racing now. through the door, after lane, moving fast. into the kitchen. fluorescent glare. the busboy turning, surprised, lane putting the shotgun in his face. freezing him. lane puts a finger to his lips: "quiet" in any language. our hand puts the magnum in the thai cook's face. we get them down on the greasy floor, lane controlling them with the shotgun. he looks at us, snaps his eyes toward the front room. we hear voices as we approach the swing door. go through. whip pan left, then right. scoping the layout. low rent thai place. red wallpaper. closing time. middle aged thai owner, by the cash register, counting money. young thai waitress, cleaning up. they look up, stunned, as we put the gun on them.}
<C>__{our voice}
<P>__{(shouting, edgy)}
<D>__{don't move, don't talk, don't do nothing.}
<A>__{our pov is whipping around, from the front door to the owner to the kitchen where lane is standing in the doorway covering the cook and busboy, back to the owner as he steps back from the cash register. we scoop up the big wad of bills: seven, eight hundred bucks in tens and fives. now yelling, herding the owner and the waitress into the kitchen, the owner trying to calm the girl in singsongy thai, lane shouting at him to shut up. into the walk in cooler. the steel door closes on four scared pair of eyes. pov looking around, seeing... a dish rack. our hand pulls out a spoon, drops the spoon handle through the hole in the cooler door latch. locking them in. lane heading out the back door. laughing, as he looks at the wad of cash our hand is waving in front of him. we follow lane to the car. snap a look down the alley one way, then the other. shit! cop black and white pulling into the far end of the alley. heartbeat goes triple time. scrambling into the car. door not even closed and spaz has it in reverse, burning rubber as he launches back down the alley. scrunch! the car grinds along one wall as spaz steers wildly backward. sparks right next to us. then kboom! as we slam into a dumpster and push it right out into the street. the cop has his lights and siren on, and is roaring at us as spaz cranks the wheel and punches it down the street. he curses in english and spanish as he weaves between cars. we pull off the stocking to see better. the cop car surges onto the street behind us. looking ahead. a red light. cars stopped, blocking the way. cutting to the right, onto the sidewalk, around the cars, into the intersection. a near miss with cross traffic, then accelerating. another red light ahead.}
<C>__{lane}
<D>__{don't stop!}
<A>__{truck entering the intersection. everyone yelling. spaz cuts the wheel but too late... clipping the truck and spinning. the street outside smearing past like the view from a tilt a whirl. then kblam! hitting something, god knows what, and launching up and over, and krunch! crushing metal and an explosion of broken glass. it gets quiet and still. tinkling glass as lane moves. then spaz is screaming. the car is upside down. crawling out of the side window. a frenzy now. whip pan to see the cops pulling up. then whipping back to the wreck. the engine is burning. flames spreading rapidly. spaz inside, pinned, upside down, blood pumping across his face. our hands pulling lane out. he comes up running. we run after him, sprinting toward the welcoming darkness of an alley. panting breath and heartbeats and sirens and somebody yelling. gunshots. looking back. cops next to their car, firing. ahead, lane running into shadow. then a door opening, a man coming out of a metal firedoor. lane grabbing him, throwing him out of the way, holding the door open as we dive through into a stairwell. lane sprinting up, two steps at a time. trying the door at the second floor landing. locked. shit. running up. dizzying whirl as we run, up and up. the pov is finally broken by a...}
