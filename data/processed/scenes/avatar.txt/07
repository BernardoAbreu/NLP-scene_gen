<L>__{exterior alley behind bar night}
<A>__{the bouncer hurls jake out the door, sending him sprawling on the pavement. a moment later, his chair crashes down on him, banging across the alley, landing in the trash. jake struggles to rise on one elbow. he's bleeding and bruised, but still crazed and ready to fight.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i hope you realize you've just lost a customer!}
<A>__{he collapses onto his back, panting.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{candy ass bitch.}
<A>__{he stares upwards at the levels of the city. magtrains roar overhead. it starts to rain. he just lies there, blinking then shouts jauntily to no one in particular }
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{if it ain't rainin' we ain't trainin'!}
<A>__{camera pulls back high and wide, as jake lies spread eagled amongst the trash, getting drenched. two long shadows enter frame, coming to rest across him. jake sees two pairs of shiny shoes stop next to him. he squints up at two men. matching suits. their features unremarkable and blandly threatening in the way of fbi agents and auditors.}
<C>__{agent 1}
<D>__{are you jake sully?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{step off. you're ruinin' my good mood.}
<C>__{agent 2}
<D>__{it's about your brother.}
