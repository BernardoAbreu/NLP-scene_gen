<A>__{mom stands on the back stoop holding the door ajar with her hip. she holds the phone receiver up in her left hand and the gun directly next to it, in her right. she squeezes off a loud shot toward the heavens.}

<A>__{as soon as the deafening sound pierces through the receiver, connor instinctively jumps up to a standing position. the bag of ice bursts as it hits the floor and spreads across it. he throws the receiver and covers his ears with both hands. the phone then falls to the ground, skipping through the cubes as the boys dive for it screaming. the two naked, hysterical boys fumble for the phone, flailing on their stomachs in the field of ice. they finally catch it and both put their ears to the receiver in panic. as they scream ma intermittently, the pauses get longer and longer.}
