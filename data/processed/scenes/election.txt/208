<L>__{exterior millard parking lot day}
<A>__{tracy walks outside hugging her yearbook and sees paul at his truck, surrounded by supplicants. tracy stops for a moment and watches. she gathers her courage and heads toward him. paul doesn't even notice her, so occupied is he with his friends and admirers.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{paul, will you sign my yearbook?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{sure, tracy.}
<A>__{paul takes the book, efficiently finds the page with his picture, and goes to work.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{can i sign yours too?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{oh, yeah, sure.}
<P>__{(to a friend)}
<D>__{hey nolan, give my book to tracy when you're done}
<A>__{nolan finishes and hands the book over. tracy turns to the front pages and finds them completely filled, as are the end pages. now she looks for her picture. when she finds it, it's almost completely obscured by part of some asswipe 's long, illegible, exclamation point filled message. finally, she locates an available space and begins to write.}
<C>__{tracy }
<D>__{i thought very carefully about what to write. because despite everything that had happened with the election, i really wished him well. i even signed it...}
<A>__{close on tracy writing: "love, tracy" beneath her inscription tracy takes paul's book back to him. he's already working on another annual and barely looks up when he swaps with her.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{thanks, tracy.}
<A>__{tracy starts to walk away and paul stops her}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{hey, tracy i..}
<A>__{she turns around expectantly}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{yes, paul?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{have a great summer. and good luck at college.}
<C>__{tracy}
<P>__{(genuinely moved)}
<D>__{thanks. you too. it was great working with you.}
<A>__{tracy opens the book as she walks and stops when she finds an almost blank page with paul's puny inscription at the bottom: have a great summer! good luck at college paul metzier'}
