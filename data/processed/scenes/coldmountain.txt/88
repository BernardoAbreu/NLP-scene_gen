<P>__{(frustrated with ruby and with herself)}
<D>__{i can't! i can't! all right? i can talk about farming in latin. will that do? i can read french. i know harmony and counterpointerior i know my bible. i can name the principal rivers of europe, but don't ask me to name one stream in this county. i can embroider, but i can't darn, i can arrange cut flowers, but i can't grow them. if a thing has a function, if i might do something with it, it wasn't considered suitable.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{ruby, you could ask why? about pretty much everything to do with me.}
<A>__{they manage to get the first line of rail set down.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{this fence is about the first thing i've ever done that'll produce an actual result.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{so you never wrapped your legs around this inman?}
