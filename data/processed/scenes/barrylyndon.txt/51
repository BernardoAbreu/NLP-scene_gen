<L>__{interior grogan's quarters day}
<A>__{roderick and grogan.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which i wanted, of my family.}
<C>__{captain grogan}
<D>__{i had news of you in dublin. faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but i think you could not do better than as you have done. but why did you not write home to your poor mother? she has sent half a dozen letters to you in dublin.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{i suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which i never thought to ask for them at the post office.}
<C>__{captain grogan}
<D>__{we must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "brown bess."}
<A>__{roderick sighs when grogan says the word "married," on which grogan says with a laugh:}
<C>__{captain grogan}
<D>__{i see you are thinking of a certain young lady at duganstown.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{is miss dugan well?}
<C>__{captain grogan}
<D>__{there's only six miss dugans now... poor dorothy.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{good heavens! whatever? has she died of grief?}
<C>__{captain grogan}
<D>__{she took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband. she is now mrs. john best.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{mrs. john best! was there another mr. john best?!}
<C>__{captain grogan}
<D>__{no, the very same one, my boy. he recovered from his wound. the ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him. it was only made of tow. do you think the dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a year out of the family? the plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you. but hit him you certainly did, roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. we told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{the coward!}
<C>__{captain grogan}
<D>__{he has paid off your uncle's mortgage. he gave dorothy a coach and six. that coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family. faith, the business was well done. your cousins, michael and harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to england, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to dublin. are you in want of cash, my boy? you may draw upon me, for i got a couple of hundred out of master best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.}
