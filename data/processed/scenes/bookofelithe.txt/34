<L>__{interior palladium guest bedroom night}
<A>__{dark outside, but the room is brightly lit by the glow of the oil lamp. eli sits up on his bed, quietly reading the old leather bound book from his backpack. another knock at the door. eli jumps up and hurriedly hides the book inside his shirt.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{the door opens to reveal solara. looking very different than she did before. cleaned up and wearing a flowery summer dress, blonde hair let down over her shoulders. stunning. unlike everyone else we have met, she seems physically, at least totally unscarred by the horrors of the times. far too beautiful a thing to belong in a world like this.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{hi. can i come in?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{someone was already here with food and water. i got everything i need.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{you sure about that?}
<A>__{she glides into the room, closing the door. she's good. very seductive. eli is totally disarmed in her presence.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{it's too bright in here. mind if i turn it down a little?}
<A>__{she doesn't wait for an answer. moves to the table and turns down the oil lamp. a darker, more seductive lighting scheme.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{that's better. i'm solara. you're walker, right?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{no. my name's eli.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{that short for something? elias?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{elijah.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{elijah. i never heard that one before. it's kinda cute.}
<A>__{she sits on the bed, kicks her legs playfully. her light cotton dress revealing in all the right places. the silhouette of her body bathed in the seductive glow of the oil lamp. no red blooded man on earth could resist her.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{look, i don't mean to be rude. but i'm really not interested.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{you sure about that? it gets mighty lonely out there on the road.}
<A>__{she leans over on the bed, resting on her elbow. her hair cascades down. god damn, she looks good.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{if you're worried about money, this is all paid for. the whole night.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's not that. you're a very nice girl. but i'm not that kind of man.}
<A>__{she slides off the bed, approaches him. begins to work the buttons of his shirt.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{they're all that kind of man.}
<A>__{he moves her hand away. gently pushes her back a step.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm not.}
<A>__{she is stunned. no man has ever turned her down before. and then she seems a little insulted.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{they told me you were crazy. maybe they were right.}
<A>__{eli opens the door for her.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm sorry. good night.}
<A>__{suddenly all her other emotions give way to fear. she moves to the door and slams it shut again. looks eli in the eye.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{please don't make me leave. i have to stay the night. if i don't...}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{if you don't, what?}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{he'll hurt my mom.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{who will? carnegie?}
<A>__{she nods, fighting back a tear. this angers eli.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{maybe he and i oughta have words.}
<A>__{he goes for the door handle, but she stops him.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{no! please, don't!}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{he's hurting you. he's hurting your mother. he's }
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{he's my dad.}
<A>__{beat. eli moves his hand away from the door.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{look, if you want to help me, just let me stay here tonight. we don't have to do anything. i will sleep on the floor. tomorrow you can tell my dad that we had a good time. i will be no trouble, i swear.}
<A>__{she looks up at eli imploringly. transformed. no longer the teenage sex kitten. now she's just a frightened little girl.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you want to have a conversation?}
<A>__{she smiles, wiping the tear from her cheek.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{eli and solara sit together on the bed. a silent beat. at first, it appears as though they have nothing to say.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you know, you don't have to be afraid of me. what happened down there in the bar...}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{i'm not afraid of you. i know you didn't start that trouble. when i first saw you, i knew you weren't the type to go looking for it.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{how'd you know that?}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{my mom says i'm a good judge of character. she says i can read people. that i know a good man when i see one.}
<A>__{she smiles. eli is surprised to find himself smiling back.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{so... you're pretty old, right?}
<A>__{eli smiles, amused by the bluntness of the question.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i just mean, i haven't seen too many people your age. how old are you exactly?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you know, i don't rightly remember.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{but you're old enough. i mean, you remember what it was like? in the world before?}
<A>__{eli nods.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what was it like?}
<A>__{eli thinks about this. dredging through old, old memories.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{better than this.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{people lived longer back then. longer than me. some were more than a hundred years old.}
<A>__{solara smiles like she's having her leg pulled.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{come on.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i swear, it's true. nowadays it's not the same. if you're sick or you're weak or you're old you won't last long out on the road.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{so how come you have?}
<A>__{beat. eli thinks. should he or shouldn't he?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{can i read you something?}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{wait. you can read?}
<A>__{eli pulls the book from his shirt. solara's eyes widen.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{and you have a book?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{not just any book.}
<A>__{for the first time we see that it's a king james bible. an embossed gold cross on its old leather cover. eli opens it up, scans the page with his finger until he finds the passage he's looking for.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{the lord is my shepherd. i shall not want. he makes me lie down in green pastures. he leads me beside still waters. he restores my soul. he leads me in the paths of righteousness.}
<A>__{on solara as she listens to eli read. transfixed.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death, i will fear no evil. for you are with me. your rod and your staff, they comfort me. you prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. you anoint my head with oil. my cup runs over. surely goodness and mercy shall follow me, all the days of my life. and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{that's beautiful. did you write that?}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what book is it from? is it poetry?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i guess you could think of it that way. it's from the holy bible.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{i never heard of it. what's it about?}
<A>__{beat as eli thinks. how on earth to answer that?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's about love, and forgiveness, and life and death, and mercy, and revenge, and the beginning and the end of the world. i guess it's about a little bit of everything.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{can i see?}
<A>__{she reaches out for the book but he snatches it away.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what? i'm not going to do anything.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm charged to protect this book. i can't trust it with anyone. not even for a while.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what's so special about that book?}
<A>__{beat. eli runs his fingers across the embossed gold cross on the beat up leather cover.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's the last one. there are no other books like this. all the others are gone destroyed by the war or in the burnings that came after. this is the only one that survived until now. the last one anywhere.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{how can you know that?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i just know.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{for a long while after it happened, i just wandered on the road like most everybody else. there were still a lot of people around back then, in the beginning. i didn't really know what i should do or where i was going. i was just moving from place to place, trying to stay alive. and then one day i heard this voice. i don't know how to explain it, it's like it was coming from inside me. but i could hear it, clear as day. clear as i can hear you talking to me now.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what did it say?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it led me to this place, i don't really know where. and i found this book buried deep under some rubble. no way no one was ever going to find it if they didn't know exactly where to look.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{but you knew because the voice told you?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{that's right. and that voice told me to carry the book west.}
<C>__{eli }
<D>__{it told me that a path would be laid out before me, that i'd be led to a place where this book would be safe. it told me i'd be protected against anyone or anything that tried to stand in my way. if only i would have faith.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that was twenty five years ago. and i've been walking ever since.}
<C>__{solara}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{because a voice you heard in your head told you to.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm not crazy. i didn't imagine it. i know what i heard.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{so who was it? the voice?}
<A>__{beat as eli considers his answer.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{a very important, very powerful man.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{more powerful than my dad?}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i should say so, yes.}
<A>__{beat. the two of them sit in silence for a moment.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{would you teach me to read?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{i never learned. no one around here knows how. only my dad, and he won't teach me. i think he likes being the only one who can read. i think it makes him feel powerful.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i think you're probably right.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{so would you teach me?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm leaving tomorrow. and i won't be back this way, ever.}
<A>__{she looks down, sad. she likes this guy. she doesn't want him to leave. eli can sense her sadness.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{are you hungry?}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{i guess a little.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{there's some food on the table over there. let's eat.}
<A>__{she walks over to where the dinner tray is covered by a small cloth. she whips it away to reveal eli's rat nibbling on a piece of cheese. solara shrieks and backs away. the rat scurries down the table leg and leaps up onto eli's shoulder, just as afraid of her as she is of it.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's okay, it's okay. he's with me.}
<P>__{(to the rat)}
<D>__{don't be afraid, pal. this is solara. she's our friend.}
<A>__{solara approaches warily. reaches out and strokes him. the rat scurries up her arm. she almost shrieks again.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's okay. it means he likes you.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{it does?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{trust me, if he didn't like you, you'd know about it.}
<A>__{solara pets the rat on her shoulder. then:}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{did you really mean that?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{mean what?}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{that i'm your friend.}
<A>__{beat. eli finds himself surprised that he admitted such a thing. when is the last time he had someone he could call a friend? he can't even remember.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{she smiles. giggles as the rat's whiskers tickle her ear. eli breaks the cheese in two and gives half to solara. she's about to eat but stops as eli clasp his hands in prayer.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{our father, we thank you for this meal which you have been so gracious to place before us.}
<A>__{unsure of what to do, solara mimics eli, putting her hands together and bowing her head.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{we thank you for a warm bed and a roof over our heads on a cold night such as this.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and we thank you for the gift of friendship in these hard times.}
<A>__{solara looks at him, touched by that.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{amen.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you say that last part too.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{amen. and now we eat?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{and now we eat.}
<A>__{they sit and eat together, sharing the simple meal. pull out from the window as they eat, away from the theater. away from the town and its flickering points of torchlight. moving farther and farther away until the entire town is consumed by the darkness of the world.}
