<A>__{the chief jerks jordan up, whirls her around like a dead dance partner, slams her face first into the pen to give the guys a good look at what's happening to that pretty face.}
<C>__{the chief}

<C>__{the chief}
<P>__{(for her ears only)}
<D>__{i am saving your life, o'neil. you may not know it, but i do. you're an inferior soldier, a bad officer, and i don't want you learning that inconvenient truth when you're stuck in a muddy bomb crater behind enemy lines and don't know how the fuck to get out. you get out now, o'neil. seek life elsewhere. and if you can't do it in front of me, do it behind my back.}

<A>__{beaten, he walks right out of camp. wordless, instructors open the pens, unlock the boxes. wickwire rises like a vampire in daylight. but this time he made it. a medic tries to help jordan, but she pushes him away, walking drunkenly for... flea. she begins wiping the makeup from his face.}
