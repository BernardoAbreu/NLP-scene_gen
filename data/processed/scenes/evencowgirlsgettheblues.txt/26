<A>__{inside howard mixes scotch and sodas, rupert fills a syringe from a vial of aminophylline he has taken from its place behind a gelatin salad mold in the refrigerator. he gives julian an injection.}

<D>__{i was a medic in the army. i really should have become a doctor. sometimes, though, i feel that pushing books is a whole lot like pushing medicine. think of books as pills. i have pills that cure ignorance and pills that cure boredom. i have pills to elevate moods and pills to open people's eyes to the awful truth...}

<D>__{too bad you don't have a pill for bullshit.}
<A>__{carla smiles as if she were joking, but she'd said it tartly. rupert glares and takes a big bite of scotch.}

<C>__{carla}
<D>__{rupert, before you get too engrossed in your research on scotch as a cure for aging, don't you think you'd better phone elaine's and cancel our dinner reservations?}
<A>__{sissy leaves her chair and wanders about the apartment. which is full of books and shelves.}
<C>__{rupert }
<D>__{what would we do without you, carla? without our little efficiency expert, carla, everything would just go to hell. carla is thinking about running for mayor next year, aren't you, carla?}
<C>__{carla }
<D>__{up yours, herr doktor book salesman. will the demands of your medical practice allow you to call elaine's or shall i?}
