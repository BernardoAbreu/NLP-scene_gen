<A>__{a man is leading duncan to the bathroom. duncan enters slowly and goes to one of the wash basins where there is an old razor blade and a can of shaving cream. duncan picks up the razor for a moment and looks at it. he is lost in thought. then he sets it down and turns on the tap water. he glances at himself in the mirror and is suddenly transfixed by his own image. he looks deeply into the mirror for several seconds. then he starts to cry, and having begun, a flood of emotions comes pouring out of him. he drops to his knees. the man comes running back into the bathroom. he holds duncan and helps pull him back to his feet.}
