<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior dining room day}
<A>__{brutal, harry, and dean are seated at the table with paul and jan. serving plates are being passes, everybody digging in:}
<C>__{the men}
<P>__{(various, ad lib)}
<D>__{ma'am, you sure know how to fry up some fine chicken...brutal, don't hog the taters now...try that corn yet? it's something special...}
<A>__{paul softly interjects:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you saw what he did with the mouse.}
<A>__{this stops everybody cold. dean puts his chicken down, wipes his hands. looks are traded in the silence.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{i could'a gone the rest of the day without you bringing that up.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{i could'a gone the rest of the year.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{he did it to me too. he put his hands on me and took my bladder infection away.}
<A>__{the men absorb this. brutal glances to jan.}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{when he came home, he was...all better.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{you're talking about an authentic healing. a praise jesus miracle.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{if you say it, i accept it. but what's it got to do with us?}
<A>__{jan looks to paul, realization starting to dawn:}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{melinda? oh, paul...}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{melinda? melinda moores?}
<A>__{paul nods that's who we're talking about.}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{you really think you can help her?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it's not a bladder infection, or even a busted up mouse. but there might be a chance.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{hold on now. you're talking about our jobs. sneak a sick woman onto a cellblock?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hal would never allow that. you know him, he wouldn't believe something unless it fell on him.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{so you're talking about taking john coffey to her. that's more than just our jobs, paul.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{damn right. that's prison time if we get caught.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{let's not discuss this like it's even an option. brutal, help me out here...}
<A>__{brutal lets out a deep breath, considering. he looks to paul.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{i'm sure she's a fine woman...}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{the finest.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what's happening to her is an offense, brutal. to the eyes and the ears and the heart.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{i have no doubt. but we don't know her like you and jan do...do we?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's why it's a lot to ask.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it is. let's not forget coffey's a murderer. what if he escapes? i'd hate losing my job or going to prison, but i'd hate having a dead child on my conscience even more.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i don't think that'll happen...}
<P>__{(beat, softly)}
<D>__{...in fact, i don't think he did it at all.}
<A>__{the men are stunned by this. off their looks:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i just can't see god putting a gift like that in the hands of a man who would kill a child.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{well, that's a tender notion, but the man's on death row for the crime. plus, he's huge. if he tried to get away, it'd take a lot of bullets to stop him.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{we'd all have shotguns in addition to sidearms. i'd insist on that.}
<P>__{(to paul)}
<D>__{he tried anything, we'd have to take him down. you understand.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{brutal}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so. tell us what you had in mind.}
