<A>__{the dragon lies half submerged. out of the water fg, a shape rises a ampsuit. inside miles quaritch, his face bloody, his eyes burning. he slogs out of the water, covered with mud, then strides into the forest. quaritch's ampsuit thuds relentlessly through the jungle. he sees something through the foliage ahead the shack. inside the shack jake is oblivious under the link. through a window we see quaritch's ampsuit step into the clearing. quaritch levels his gau 90 at the shack. his finger goes to the firing button wham!! a six legged black demon tackles him. quaritch pivots as he falls, firing the cannon. it misses neytiri by inches. he grapples with the thanator as its razor claws screech over his metal armor. the titans twist and struggle. quaritch unleashes a long burst from the cannon. rounds tear into the creature, which shrieks but neytiri wills it to smash the cannon hard against a rock, tearing it loose from the `suit's hand but quaritch slams the thanator back against a tree trunk, almost crushing neytiri. close on one hydraulic hand, as it draws the `suit's knife and quaritch twists violently, ramming the knife up under the thanator's chest armor. the creature roars and quaritch flips on top of it, stabbing. quaritch stabs down again. the thanator slumps, pinning neytiri's legs under its great bulk. she is trapped. quaritch looks down at neytiri. she glares back at him, panting, scared but defiant.}

<A>__{quaritch surges forward. jake closes fast, snatching up the broken cannon as quaritch slashes down with the knife and jake parries, blocking it with the cannon. he closes faster than the suit can move and k crack! slams the end of the cannon into the canopy, crazing it with a web of cracks as quaritch slices air with the huge knife. jake ducks, coming up to meet the next slash and smashes the knife hand with the cannon once twice again in a furious attack knocking the knife flying. quaritch catches him with the other arm, hurling him away. jake rolls just before thuddd! the massive foot stomps down where he just was. he scrambles up as quaritch charges and jake ducks another round house, leaping forward to smash the canopy again then again until it is white with cracks. quaritch manages to grab the cannon barrel but inside the cockpit, he sees nothing but the sun on the shattered glass. he hurls the cannon blindly, but jake ducks. the massive cylinder cartwheels toward the shack and from inside we see it crash against pressure window, crazing it but not penetrating. jake's link sits just inside. inside the cockpit, quaritch yanks a yellow handle and p foom! the canopy blows off, flying through the air. quaritch can see again. he dons his breathing mask. bends to pick up his knife. nearby neytiri struggles furiously, trying to get her legs free from underneath three tons of thanator. quaritch, panting, glowers at jake.}

<A>__{then, inexplicably, he turns. walks away. from inside the shack, we see him charge straight toward us and crash! he puts his hydraulic fist right through the window. he is reaching inside for the link when jake hits in a flying tackle with every ounce of force he has, knocking the ampsuit sideways and jake reaches around the suit, grabbing quaritch's shoulder and, yanks him forward hard, smashing his face into the edge of the cockpit but quaritch flings him off with a sweep of his arm, and jake slams to the ground. inside the link jake is holding his breath as the toxic pandoran air swirls in. gas alarms shriek. neytiri shoves with one free leg, desperately trying to pull her other leg out. the ampsuit charges, the knife flashing down and jake just manages to catch it in both hands, but the force of the attack drives him to his knees as quaritch pushes the knife down inexorably, until jake is pinned against a rock, the blade now inches from his throat. inside the link jake is straining to stay conscious, to stay connected as the knife reaches his throat as thwap! an arrow appears in quaritch's chest. he looks up. neytiri stands a fury released. a classic archer figure, she nocks another arrow. then draws and releases smoothly. th whap! the machine topples off jake and lies still. quaritch stares at the two arrows in his chest. he touches the feathers of the ancient weapon, then with an ironic laugh he dies. neytiri runs up, another arrow nocked, bow drawn. seeing quaritch, she lowers her father's bow. jake sees her, then goes limp, his eyes rolling back, and }
