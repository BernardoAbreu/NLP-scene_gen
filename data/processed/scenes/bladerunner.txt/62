<A>__{onstage four mexican acrobats, in matching metallic jumpsuits roll head over heels in their rendition of a human wheel. from the p.a. system the announcer's voice blares through the cavernous theatre.}

<D>__{let's hear it for the hermano brothers.}
<A>__{scattered applause. hand in hand, the hermano brothers bow deeply, spring up and trot offstage.}
<C>__{announcer's voice}
<D>__{next we're gonna see a little charmer who keeps her dancing partner in a basket! she comes to us all the way from exotic casablanca. 'salome.'}
<A>__{the old boys in the pit strike up a tinny version of "in a persian market" as salome dances onstage. she's a black haired beauty in a scant belly dancer costume, a couple of pounds overweight but all in the right places. she kneels ceremoniously center stage and sets the basket down before her. carefully removing the lid, she reaches in and lifts out a four foot harlequin patterned python. grinding her hips to the music, she rises, holding the coiling snake out like an offering. sounds of approval from the audience. the gold coins covering her breasts jingle and shimmer, as she weaves sensuously around the floor.}
