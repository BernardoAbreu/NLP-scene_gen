<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{sandro's apartment is extremely small. although it contains many books, it has the atmosphere of a place that is very seldom lived in. sandro has just finished knotting his tie. he closes his suitcase and heads toward the door. he turns back, however, to pick up a towel fallen from the bed. he takes the towel into the bathroom. then he goes to the door again, opens it, and sees anna. she appears a little anxious. without giving sandro a chance to say a word, she enters the apartment, closing the door behind her. sandro puts down his suitcase and is about to embrace her, but anna steps aside and begins staring at him with an intense look upon her face. taking him all in with her eyes, she examines his suit, his hands, his legs, his shoes. then her gaze moves back up to his face which she proceeds to scrutinize. sandro is unable to understand her behavior, so he shrugs and jokingly exclaims:}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{would you like to see my profile?}
<A>__{he snaps himself into profile, then turns, slowly, in the manner of a store window mannequin. anna continues to stare at him. this time she peers directly into his eyes. sandro is no longer amused.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{well, what is it?}
<A>__{finally, anna puts an end to her staring, and taking sandro by the hand she leads him around the room. she stops in front of a mirror and looks at herself. the expression on her face becomes taut, determined. she starts unbuttoning her dress as she continues looking at herself in the mirror. sandro comes up close to her shoulders, caresses her hair, and whispers softly into her ear.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{but your friend is waiting downstairs.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{she'll wait.}
<A>__{anna turns around and presses herself up against him with such a violent passion that sandro is somewhat dismayed. but only for an instant. soon they are feverishly kissing each other, and it is almost with a sense of sheer animal pleasure that sandro abandons himself.}
