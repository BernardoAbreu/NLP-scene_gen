<A>__{we are now on a drum solo. ernie the elephant of the smoochyland band works it. the animal band plays a sloppy version of "pop goes the weasel." end on spinner dunn the newest and by far largest member of the band. spinner holds s cowbell and seems to be concentrating intently on the proper moment to hit it. unfortunately, his rhythm is off, which throws the rest of the band off as well. we widen out to see smoochy and the rhinettes attempting to dance to the off kilter rhythm. the song finally ends. the rhinettes glare at spinner. smoochy addresses the camera.}

<D>__{boy, wasn't that fun? in an awkward kind of way? anyhoo, how 'bout a big round of applause for the newest member of the smoochyland band... former heavyweight contender, spinner dunn!}
<A>__{spinner stands up to take a bow and almost knocks the entire bandstand over. there is a smattering of confused applause from the kids in the bleachers. spinner drops the cowbell and it clangs on the studio floor.}
