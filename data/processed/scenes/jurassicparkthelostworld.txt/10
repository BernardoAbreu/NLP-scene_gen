<L>__{interior hammond's bedroom night}
<A>__{malcolm enters a darkened bedroom. john hammond lies in the bed we saw earlier, on the other side of the room; medical equipment has been disguised as well as possible among the furniture and flowers, but the sheer abundance of it tells us that whatever has stricken him is going to win this battle.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{ian! don't linger in the doorway like an ingenue, come in, come in!}
<A>__{malcolm steps further into the room.}
<C>__{hammond }
<D>__{it's good to see you. it really is. how's the leg?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{resentful.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{when you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember. it's the people who challenged you. it is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning. i never told you how sorry i was about what happened after we returned.}
<A>__{noticing hammond's deteriorated condition, malcolm finds it hard to sustain anger.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i didn't know you weren't well.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{it's the lawyers. the lawyers are finally killing me.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{they do have motives. why did you want to see me? your message said it was urgent.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{you were right and i was wrong. there! did you ever think you'd hear me say that? spectacularly wrong. instead of observing those animals, i tried to control them. i squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives. not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild. behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist. i could have had it, but i let it slip away.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{thank god for site b.}
<A>__{malcolm just looks at him for a long moment.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{hammond}
<P>__{(a spark in his eye)}
<D>__{well? didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{the hatchery, in particular? you know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth. genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory i showed you.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i don't believe you.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{isla nublar was just a showroom, ian, something for the tourists, site b was the factory floor. we built it first, on isla sorna, eight some miles from nublar.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{no, no, no, no, no, no . . .}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{after the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on site b. we had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. and they did. for four years i've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now i want you to go there and document them.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{are you out of your mind? i still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot you think i need more of that?}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{it would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{so what?}
<A>__{hammonnd picks up a thick file folder from the night table near to him and open it on his lap. inside, there are memos, charts, maps and photographs.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{i've been putting this together for over a year. i have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people. they won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them. just use my checkbook to get them there. i will fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately. if we hesitate, all will be lost.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{john . . .}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{you'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials. i believe you already know sarah harding. she's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter scavengers i bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this. if you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup. when she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously.}
<A>__{malcolm just shakes his head, flipping through the file sadly.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{your documentation, you should use forensic photographic methods, hasselbladt still cameras, high definition video. when the trick photography analysts take your evidence apart, make it impossible for them to say there was enhancement or computer graphic imaging. oh, this is very important avoid the island interior at all costs. stick to the outer rim. everything you need to know can be found there. vindication lies on the outer rim.}
<A>__{malcolm gently closes the file and pushes it back to hammond.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i'm not going, john.}
<C>__{hammond}
<P>__{(fatigue returning)}
<D>__{ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. i can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it. i will not be known only for my failures. and you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic. you're too smart. you'e too proud. dr. malcolm. please. this is a chance at redemption. for both of us. there's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before }
<A>__{he stops, staring over malcom's shoulder. malcom turns. peter ludlow, still in his overcoat, is standing in the doorway to the bedroom. he looks back and forth from hammond to malcolm suspiciously.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{hello, uncle john. dr. malcolm.}
<A>__{malcolm doesn't answer. he seems to know ludlow, and dislikes him.}
<C>__{ludlow }
<D>__{did i interrupt something?}
<A>__{malcolm turns back to hammond.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{find someone else.}
