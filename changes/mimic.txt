<ACTION>__{Stygean darkness. Wet CLICKING SOUNDS. A BEAM of purplish ULTRA-VIOLET LIGHT reveals a mosaic of moving forms... COCKROACHES. They skitter restlessly under the beam's intensity. SERIES OF SHOTS -- the UV Beam passing over various parts of the space. Pipe webs, walls, girders -- all covered with the insects. Thousands of them.}

<ACTION>__{Innards of steel. A vast maze of tunnels. A GROUP OF FIGURES advances through the tunnels with handheld UV lamps. The figures are dressed in gray air-tight NEOPRENE SUITS, their faces hidden by skin tight MASKS and bug-like NIGHT VISION GOGGLES. In the dense silence, respirator valves HISS- CLICK at the corner of their lips in mechanical rhythm. The scene has a dream-like, choreographed quality. NIGHT-VISION POV Eerie, aquatic green.  The horde of insects appear to be some kind of sea-life, crawling over the floor of a dead ocean.}

<ACTION>__{MIDTOWN MANHATTAN.  A cacophony of SOUND and LIGHT. Dirty snow drifts over Bryant Park. Emergency lights blink everywhere. A wall of cars sits on Sixth Avenue, stopped dead. Exhaust fumes hang in the air. Jaded TRAFFIC COPS send the cars on crosstown detours. Mounted policemen patrol a line of yellow sawhorses near dozens of Department of Public Health vehicles, angle-parked in a military phalanx. A monumental ribcage-like scaffolding has been erected in the middle of the street, "sealing" the area with amber plastic. Inside, UNIFORMED WORKERS take the disposal drum of roaches and toss it into one of a number of huge DUMPSTERS. The Team Leader watches from nearby, exhauster.  Her mask is off. We see her face: Enthomologist SUSAN WYETH, 28. An ARM gently drapes over her shoulder.}

<ACTION>__{Empty warehouses. Closed businesses. Traffic lights blinking on empty streets. Everything seems doomed under the heavy layer of rain. SUPERIMPOSE:  TWO YEARS LATER A DILAPIDATED BUILDING before us. A blazing NEON CROSS made of the words 'JESUS SAVES' hangs askew from its facade. CRANE to see the ROOFTOP. WHAM! The door to the interior stairs FLIES OPEN and a tall, thin CHINESE PREACHER in his sixties lurches out, eyes wild with terror. He looks back down the steps. Something's climbing up fast, casting ominous, complex shadows on the wall. Too many FOOTSTEPS for it to be just one person. The man hurriedly shuts the door and slides a bolt home. Trembling, he backs away as a booming THUD makes the door shudder. Raw, frenzied pounding and scratching follows... something inhuman, determined to break through. The metal surface suddenly buckles and bulges. On the man's white undershirt, a blotch of blood starts to grow.  Needles of rain stab his flesh. He searches wildly for a possible escape. He reaches the edge of the roof: it's five floors down to the sidewalk. Two of the hinges on the door come loose, pulverizing the surrounding concrete. WHAM!  The door to the stairs bulges outward as something SMASHES against it again and again.  Frenzied SCRATCHING. The man sprints to the other end of the roof. There, on the adjoining building... THE CHINESE PREACHER'S POV Just one floor below on the building across the alley is a suspended PAINTERS' PLATFORM, crowded with paint cans under a tarp.  A two-story old EYEWEAR ADVERTISEMENT from the 40's is being painted over.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{THE DOOR EXPLODES OUTWARD AND SKIDS ACROSS THE SLIPPERY ROOF.}
<ACTION>__{Light from inside projects the shadow of wild, busy things onto the curtain of rain. Weeping with fear, the man desperately tries to hurl himself to the catwalk. It's too far. He FALLS...CRASH!  he hits the platform, knocking boards loose and sending paint cans onto their sides, rolling.  He bounces, slides off the edge, barely able to grab onto a loose board to save himself from falling. The RAIN blasts down.  The scaffold CREAKS.  He hits the edge, upsetting the cans of paint there. He holds onto the planks with all his might, trying to push with his feet, but they slide on the wet wall.}

The Mimic CRUSHES the machine instantly, then chomps up all the candy bars with a single move of its mandibles. Susan watches in terror as the creature steps away. A SOUND from an adjacent tunnel.  Susan looks... ...and sees ANOTHER MIMIC pulling the REMAINS OF A MAN into the darkness. Susan gropes around her in the soggy debris, looking for some weapon. SUSAN'S HAND Her fingers close around a three-foot piece of RUSTY PIPE. Something dark drips on her hand.}
