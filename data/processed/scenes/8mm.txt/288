<A>__{welles waits in line with his cart. it's a long line. he takes out his wallet, opens it. in the fold of the wallet, there's a photo folded into quarters. welles unfolds it and looks at it dolefully. it's the photo of mary anne mathews, the image welles printed from early in the snuff film. sad girl. welles folds in back up, puts it in another pocket. he looks forward in the line to see if it's moving.}
