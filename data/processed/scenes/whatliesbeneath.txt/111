<L>__{interior norman and claire's room night}
<A>__{claire glances over at the soundly sleeping norman. she gingerly slides out of bed.}
<L>__{interior basement night}
<A>__{claire sits among the boxes, leafing through the photo album, tracking the years of their life. her hands tremble. finally she reaches the picture of their wedding, reaches behind the photo and produces...the key.}
<L>__{exterior dock night}
<A>__{claire in her nightgown and a jacket, walks slowly down the dock. an expensive looking flashlight illuminates her path. she stops and stares out at the moonlit lake. she holds out a fist. her fingers unfold and in her palm lies the key. she holds the key out over the water and stands there, frozen. the lighthouse beam sweeps past her once...then again. claire pulls her hand back and holds the key to her chest, then carefully places it on the dock. she very deliberately takes off her jacket and slippers, steps to the edge of the dock, shines the flashlight on the dark water...then steps off the dock.}
