<D>__{you know a friend of mine broke his hand a while back. put in a cast. very next day he takes a fall, protects his bad hand, falls on his good one, breaks that too. so now he's got two busted flippers and i say to him "creighton, i hope your wife loves you.

<C>__{marty}
<D>__{it's not strictly legal.}
<A>__{visser shrugs, lights up another cigarette with his fraternally inscribed lighter and drops the lighter onto the dashboard.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{if the pay's right i will do it.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{it's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. the more i think about it the more irritated i get.}

<D>__{...gee, i'm sorry to hear that. can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{listen, i'm not this isn't a joke here.}
<A>__{visser eyes him, still smiling. finally he shrugs.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{you want me to kill 'em.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{i didn't say that.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{well?}

<C>__{marty}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{you're an idiot.}
<A>__{marty's shoulders slump. he seems less tense, almost relieved.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{so, uh... this wouldn't interest you.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{i didn't say that. all i said was you're an idiot. hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.}
<A>__{they are staring at each other.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{ten thousand dollars i will give you.}
<A>__{visser laughs again.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{i'm supposed to do a murder two murders and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. i mean real stupid. now why should i trust you?}
<C>__{marty}

<P>__{(sobering)}
<D>__{the money. yeah. that's a right smart of money...}
<A>__{he turns and gazes out the window.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{...in russia they make only fifty cents a day.}
<A>__{he falls silent again, still staring out the window in the closeness of the car marty is starting to sweat.}

<D>__{go down to corpus for a few days. get yourself noticed. i will give you a call when it's done... you just find a way to cover that money.}
<A>__{marty is slumped in his seat, not responding to the fact that visser has just ended the conversation. finally he rouses himself and gets out of the car, leaving visser staring at the door he has left open behind him. after a moment we hear marty's footsteps approaching again, and he leans back into the open door with an afterthought.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{i will take care of the money, you just make sure those bodies aren't found... there's a...}
<A>__{these words are difficult to say.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{...if you want, there's a big incinerator behind my place...}
<A>__{the two men look at each other. marty leaves. after a moment, visser leans over to grab the handle of the still open door.}
