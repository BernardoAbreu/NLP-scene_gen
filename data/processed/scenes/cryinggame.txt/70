<C>__{jude}
<D>__{aye, i was sick of being blond. needed a tougher look, if you know what i mean.}
<A>__{she lies down on the bed beside him, takes off a black leather glove, and puts her hand on his crotch.}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{fuck me, fergus.}
<A>__{he takes her hand away.}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{am i to take it that's a no?}

<C>__{jude}
<D>__{we had a court martial in your absence. they wanted to put a bullet in your head. i pleaded for clemency. said we should find out what happened first. so what did happen?}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{he ran. i couldn't shoot him in the back. i tried to catch him. he made it to the road and got hit by a saracen.}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{so you did fuck up.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{but you know what the thing is, fergus?}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{no, what is the thing?}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{you vanished quite effectively. became mister nobody. and you've no idea how useful that could be.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{we've got some plans here. and we'll need a mister nobody to execute them.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{no way, jude. i'm out.}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{you're never out, fergus.}
<A>__{she looks at him hard. he looks away.}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{maybe you don't care whether you die or not. but consider the girl, fergus. the wee black chick.}
<A>__{he leaps up from the bed.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{leave her out of this.}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{jesus, fergus, you're a walking cliche. you know we won't leave her out of this. but i'm glad to see you care.}
<A>__{she brings her lips close to his so they touch.}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{and i must admit i'm curious.}
<A>__{he grabs her hair and pulls her head back.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{what the fuck do you know, jude?}
<A>__{she pulls a gun and sticks it between his teeth.}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{you fucking tell me, boy }
<A>__{fergus stares at her. then says quietly:}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{she's nobody. she likes me.}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{so i suppose a fuck is out of the question. keep your head down, fergus. no sudden moves. and not a whisper to her. you'll be hearing from us.}
<A>__{she kisses him briefly, with the gun at his temple.}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{keep the faith.}
<A>__{she goes. fergus stands in the darkness.}
