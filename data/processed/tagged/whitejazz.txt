<D>__{i'm old. and all i have left is the will to remember...}
<A>__{i reach into a dresser drawer, pull out a yellowed black & white picture of her: this beatific blonde, sleeping. below me is a week old l.a. times with the headline: matriarch of television series, empire ridge, retires. the matriarch's picture in the middle.}
<D>__{me (v.o.) (cont'd) ...and the fear i will forget...}
<A>__{slide her over the matriarch's picture: the matriarch 30 years younger now. lift my eyes back to my reflection.}
<D>__{me (v.o.) (cont'd) i killed innocent men. i betrayed sacred oaths. i reaped profit from horror. the names are dead or too guilty to tell. the events so brutal they beg to be re told...}

<C>__{me }
<D>__{lieutenant dave klein, vice division. lapd. that's what my face looked like before.}

<D>__{me (v.o.) (cont'd) junior stemmons. a partner i never asked for. the scowl meant to hide a shit scared kid who'd been teaching evidence classes three months ago. his old man was an lapd lifer who never got past sergeant.}

<D>__{we should make our move now.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{mid fight? look at the crowd: you wanna be at the center of a riot?}

<C>__{me}
<D>__{we let sanderline finish this beating, we get his gratitude.}
<A>__{junior eyes the exits clockwise, nervous, waiting for `untouchables' to break the doors down. i hate the way panic smells when i stand this close to it.}

<D>__{we gonna let rock a bye fight too }
<C>__{me}
<D>__{ relax junior.}
<L>__{interior locker room moments later}

<D>__{sanderline, i'm lieutenant klein of the lapd and a real big fan }
<C>__{junior stemmons}

<D>__{ lieutenant dave why you arrest }
<C>__{me}
<D>__{ for being a ranked fighter who still steals hubcaps. shut up.}

<D>__{ladies and gentleman...due to circumstances beyond our control, rock a bye ruiz will not fight this }
<A>__{ boos drown the pa. beer and lit cigars shell the announcer. fights erupt in the stands. i can't stifle a chuckle. three exits down: day late dollar short feds. welles noonan, elbows out, surveying the scene like a half assed rommel.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{welles noonan, us attorney. ivy league crimefighter. launching a big boxing probe as a way to begin prying into everything else crooked and corrupt in la.}
<A>__{move faster.}
<D>__{me (v.o.) (cont'd) unaware the lapd was walking away with his two big witnesses.}
<A>__{as we near the side exit i stop. junior pauses, less than a foot from my face, pointing up at noonan, pure panic.}
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<D>__{c'mon jesus he's right there!}
<A>__{my p.o.v.: second row, washed up gangster mickey cohen with a blonde far too beautiful for his world, a woman you've seen before, but only in a yellowed b&w picture 30 years in the future. i can't take my eyes away...five seconds }
<C>__{junior stemmons }
<D>__{ he sees us!}
<A>__{noonan's gaze strafes us. i see him squinterior}

<C>__{me}
<D>__{you live in la, asshole. you do not live in `federal government.'}
<A>__{ruiz turns `caught me' pink...i nod to junior: split `em. playing adjoining hotel rooms like sweat boxes.}
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<D>__{we get to spend time alone now.}
<C>__{reuben ruiz}
<D>__{want some perfume?}
<A>__{junior shoves ruiz through the inner door connecting the rooms. sanderline giggles. close the door behind them. sit down inches from sanderline, change my tone:}

<C>__{me }
<D>__{what were you gonna tell welles noonan?}
<P>__{(watch as he flinches)}
<D>__{he has a subpoena with your name on it, sanderline. why would someone like you need to talk to the u.s. attorney?}
<A>__{sanderline staying silent...}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{you're a legbreaker for the mob. i know the men that pay you for that will murder you if they hear you're about to talk to the u.s. }

<D>__{ yer gonna have to make a minute for him. now. see, we think the spade might testify that sam owns him and how we was grooming him for a title shot he was gonna tank. a fight everybody woulda' got flush off of, including the spade.}
<P>__{(beat, quieter)}
<D>__{have him look out the window klein.}
<A>__{click. a breath. drop the phone on the cradle...step to the window...open it...then i chuckle genuine:}
<C>__{me}

<A>__{trusting puppy sanderline steps to the window:}
<C>__{sanderline johnson}
<D>__{what'm i }
<A>__{ smash his head against the frame using his forward motion. he loses muscle control for the split second it takes me to pitch his legs up and out. my face a quick change evil mask. feature sanderline's nine story fall. that ambassador hotel robe billows behind him like a cape. he detonates an overhead streetlight with a bomb sound, then hits the driveway. unzip my fly, hustle into the bathroom, screams from outside now. flush the toilet as junior and ruiz pile through the door. step out, play it baffled: look at the bed where sanderline sat, then the open window, screams floating up...}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{did that mutt just jump?}
<A>__{lunge to the window: sanderline post mortem. head shattered. valets sprinting. junior on the phone. ruiz steps up next to me: horrified. i keep staring at the smashed body...whisper:}

<D>__{remember where you live.}
<A>__{reuben has to use both hands to steady himself.}
<L>__{interior police headquarters bradley's office morning}

<C>__{muffled protest amalgam }
<D>__{mexican brothers si! imperial dodgers no!}
<A>__{four of us at the table glued to the t.v, watching u.s. attorney welles noonan lambasting the lapd.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{la's version of the young turks, only meaner. me (v.o.) (cont'd) boyce bradley, chief of detectives. smartest man in town. and one of the richest: dad was a real estate developer who owned a strip of land that's now known as the santa monica freeway. on either side, bradley's book ends: d.a. bob gallaudet, not the smartest man in town: `gas chamber' bob cribbed my notes at usc law. and tom bethune, running for a city council seat that'll decide if this mexican slum called chavez ravine gets bulldozed and renamed `dodger stadium.'}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{turn it off.}
<A>__{bethune leaps like a lapdog, hits the power.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{i was pissing. he was jumping.}
<A>__{bradley picks up a newspaper:}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{`us attorney noonan is accusing the los angeles police department in general, and lt. david klein in particular, of murder at worst, gross incompetence at best...'}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{noonan had sanderline scared. after he sang to me he panicked & jumped.}
<C>__{tom bethune}
<D>__{he did spend a month in camarillo mental hospital last year }
<C>__{gas chamber bob}
<D>__{ and wearing that hotel robe over his clothes makes him look even more looney bin.}
<C>__{tom bethune}
<D>__{plus, reuben ruiz recanted. so noonan's boxing probe is dead. he's got nothing }
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{ but time, a mandate and new targets...i need to speak to the lieutenant alone.}
<A>__{bob and tom nod, pat my back on the way out: proud uncles lending support before dad drops the hammer. door closes. i stand, step to the window, big pro mex protest below: geeks and placards: `baseball is as american as the trail of tears!}
<C>__{bradley }
<D>__{describe to me your duty, as you understood it, regarding sanderline johnson and reuben ruiz.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{take both men into custody before noonan and the feds could, and find out what they were going to tell }
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{ and why did i choose you for this?}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{because i'm a cop with a law degree, and you thought my legal }
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{ because your a thug with a law degree. because i thought by now you'd be so indebted to this department for not indicting and or imprisoning you, that diligent, honest discharge of duty would be assured.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and i made a horrible misjudgment.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{bethune and gallaudet don't think so.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{bob's happy because he wants to be state attorney general and his most likely opponent will be welles noonan. tom's happy because morton diskant, who's leading their city council race, is endorsed by noonan. thus, they're not seeing the larger play.}
<P>__{(with calculated emphasis)}
<D>__{noonan's new target will likely be the lapd itself.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{how do you know that?}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{because that's where i would aim: a subpoenaed federal witness plummets to his death in the company of two lapd detectives?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{this screams police corruption. this offers noonan the possibility of payback in the form of national headlines.}
<A>__{i wave it all off:}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{johnson did that stint at the nut house leak his file to your friends at the times }
<A>__{ and bradley drops his bomb: coroner's file. i stare...guess the contents...try to keep my heart rate in check...}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{my friends would be more interested in this.}
<P>__{(beat, flipping file open)}
<D>__{coroner's preliminary: white paint chips found embedded in sanderline johnson's scalp. a matching dent on the white window sill. i checked with the hotel switchboard and found a call was patched to your room at about the same time johnson flew out of it.}
<P>__{(beat, proclamation:)}
<D>__{it shocks and sickens me that your allegiance to the chicago mob would take precedence over the lapd.}
<C>__{me}
<P>__{(fuck drawing this out)}
<D>__{alright. where's this going?}
<P>__{(pull my badge, table it)}
<D>__{gun? shield? what?}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{the appearance of disciplinary measures taken against you are mandated post sanderline johnson, so your suspension will be recorded but sealed...and kept quiet for now }
<C>__{me}
<D>__{so if the papers or noonan come sniffing around }
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{ we can provide adequate proof of your dismissal.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{but you're not dismissing me.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{just on paper.}
<P>__{(closes the file)}
<D>__{since i misjudged the cop i thought you were, i'm going to leverage the cop that you are.}

<C>__{bradley }
<D>__{morton diskant is to be removed from the city council race. the means and methods implemented to that end i will entrust to you.}

<P>__{(throw a thumb at bethune)}
<D>__{you want me to torpedo diskant so your buddy bethune can win a city council seat uncontested }
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{ or spend the next month in lock up before being arraigned on charges of gross misconduct and dereliction of duty. the preamble before you face life in prison for murder.}
