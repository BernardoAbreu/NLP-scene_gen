<A>__{a car pulls out, straight ahead. utah swerves wildly, mostly gets around him. the guy's bumper and front grille are removed. utah does a smoking skid recovery. doesn't even slow down. the late model t bird is weaving manically. it makes a sliding turn onto a cross street half a block ahead of the fbi agents. utah cuts the wheel into a huge ralph's parking lot. pedestrians scatter. utah center punches a week's supply of groceries in a cart.}
