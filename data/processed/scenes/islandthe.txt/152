<L>__{interior. apartment day}
<A>__{lincoln enters, wary, scanning around. a living room. framed pictures. a sofa, chairs. a coffee table, empty bottles, cigarette packs, a full ashtray. a bureau, some paperwork. silence, stillness. no sign of life, no sense of danger. lincoln moves across to the bureau and starts leafing through the papers. ester ventures in through the door, curious }
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{what are you looking for?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i don't know. something. just wait there and make sure nobody's coming.}
<A>__{as he leafs the papers, ester waits dutifully by the door. her eyes wander across the framed pictures. then narrow onto a 3d p h o t o g r a p h . a college boxing team photo, grinning cup winners.}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{l o o k at this...}
<A>__{lincoln returns to her. ester points to the photo. a face in the row, blurred but eerily familiar. lincoln seems not to react. ester, curiosity piqued, scans the other pictures. she alights on a framed certificate "thomas r. lincoln, attorney at law".}
<C>__{a man's voice }
<D>__{what the hell are you doing?}
<A>__{lincoln turns to confront a man in a robe. disheveled from sleep, grey from a hangover... the man's face is unmistakably his own. this is tom lincoln, sponsor of lincoln six echo, his bleary eyes now widening in disbelief as he recognizes his agnate }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{oh, jesus...}
<A>__{lincoln is better prepared for this encounter but still stunned by the sight of his double in the flesh. sponsor and agnate stand frozen. the only movement is ester, her eyes flicking between the same men, fraught, confused. lincoln breaks the silence }
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{lincoln steps closer, eyes piercing. tom takes a step back.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{the y said... i'd never have to see you.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{who?}
<A>__{lincoln takes another step closer. tom takes another step back.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{the people...}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{what people?}
<A>__{lincoln takes another step closer. tom stiffens, gathers himself }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{look, if you don't get out of here right now, i'm calling security...}
<A>__{lincoln examines him, assimilating. his double seems to be as belligerent as he is. reasoning now, threat response kicking in. lincoln draws the hunting knife. unused to it, he points it like a gun. but it's enough of a threat for tom, who swallows dryly }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{why are you here? what do you want?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i want to know...}
<A>__{tom grimaces at the ambiguity. that face. his f a c e . if not for the pounding headache this would be a bad dream. he lowers onto the sofa. finds a cigarette and lights up. a drag, mind kicking in. the knife cautioning him. with a slow exhale, he confesses }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{one of the partners at my firm... he told me about it. gave me a referral. i thought he was joking at first. i went out there, took the sales tour. even before that i knew it wasn't a joke. there was this discretion agree ment. i never saw anything like it and i've seen a lot. ironclad... breathe a word and they've got you by the balls. i don't know... there's cancer in my family. maybe it was just to keep up. all the partners were on the policy.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{the policy?}
<A>__{he looks at his agnate. then realizes the level of ignorance.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{christ, you have no idea, do you?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{about what?}
<A>__{tom drags his cigarette, fingers trembling. he shakes his head }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i can't fucking do this...}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<A>__{lincoln moves closer, pointing the knife. tom flinches, then }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{insurance. you're an insurance policy.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{health insurance... medical...}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{if i get sick... if part of me gets sick... i take a healthy part from you.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{how do you expect me to answer that? it's just how it works, that's all.}
<A>__{tom looks at his agnate. the insistent stare. the knife, pointing at him like a finger. his fear yields to a flicker of anger }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what do you want? a fucking apology?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{why do i look like you?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{because you are me . . .}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{because they made you from my cells...}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{made me?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{( a flare of anger)}
<D>__{that's right. you were made. cooked up in a centrifuge like a fucking boiled egg. every thought running through your head, every word coming out of your mouth, all of it, manufactured, made...}
<A>__{lincoln frowns, trying to assimilate. too much to process.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{you . . . you're the one who made me?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{who made me?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i signed a contract. i can show you.}
<A>__{he gestures to a mirror on the wall. lincoln steps back but his eyes are unremitting. tom rises, cautious, crossing to the wall. he opens the mirror to reveal a wall safe. his trembling fingers tap the keypad and the safe hisses open. he draws out a contract folder embossed with a crosshatch. then offers it to his agnate }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{it's all right there. who, why...}
<A>__{lincoln takes the contract folder and starts flipping the pages, reading. a pendulous silence falls. tom stands watching, smoking nervously. ester stands by the door, trying to take all this in.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{look you've got what you wanted. now why don't you just get out of here?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<P>__{(pause, looks at him)}
<D>__{there are men out there, looking for us. i want you to make them stop.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i can't...}
<A>__{lincoln sets down the contract and brings up the knife again.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i can't. look, i'm a lawyer, i know how it works. the contract, everything, it's all laced with confidentiality clauses. it means they don't want this to get out. it means whatever i do, they're not going to stop. you understand?}
<A>__{lincoln pauses, assimilating. his double's expression indicates that he's telling the truth. maybe try a more practical request }
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{do you have transport?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{transport , yes... yes, parked downstairs... bay 53... take it...}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{and then you'll call security?}
<A>__{lincoln steps closer, pointing the knife. tom tries to stay dead pan. the lawyer kicking in. look them in the eye when you lie }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i'm not going to call security. i'm not going to call anybody, okay?}
<A>__{lincoln looks at his double, reason now yielding to anger. deep, roiling. tom looks at his agnate, fear welling, deadpan cracking }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{look, maybe there's something... maybe there's a way to cancel the contract...}
<A>__{lincoln presses the tip of the blade to his double's cheek.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{for christ's sake! it's not my fault!}
<A>__{lincoln inches the blade deeper into the trembling face, drawing blood. the anger urging, hungry for more blood. then suddenly }
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{lincoln ! no!}
<A>__{lincoln looks at her, the anger interrupted, the knife still in place. he pauses. then returns to his double. the dreading eyes, the trickle of blood down the face. his e y e s . his f a c e . a long, foreboding moment. then suddenly lincoln lashes out. his fist sends his double flying, falling in a flurry of contract pages. lincoln stands over him, looking down, like a dominant species. his double is unmoving, unconscious. lincoln abruptly spins away.}
