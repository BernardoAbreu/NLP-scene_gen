<C>__{cop}
<D>__{ok, so we're gonna have to let you go now. we may very well be calling on you again very soon, but in the meantime, let this be a warning to you. regardless of what evidence we do or don't find, you've come to our attention today. our attention isn't good.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{but i didn't do anything.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{you hearing me here? these are very serious crimes we've been presented with. let's just say someone had been in that car, and they'd burned to death. we'd be talking about manslaughter, possibly murder. have you thought about that? you'd be sitting here with detectives from homicide right now. these are felony offences we're talking about, son. serious jail time offences.}
<A>__{tj nods, his dad looks on.}
