<L>__{interior starbucks day}
<A>__{it's saturday. the place is buzzing. sam listlessly cleans the tables, without the usual energy and verve. a toddler marches around a table, playing under the adoring gaze of his parents.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{excuse me, my kid knocked over a coffee, could you clean this up?}
<A>__{sam sees a family at a table covered with spilled coffee.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{i said i need a refill and a towel over here.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(snapping)}
<D>__{you need a towel? a refill? a glass of water? you need more than you already have? you have everything }
<P>__{(all his fury and frustration)}
<D>__{everything. but it's not enough. take my daughter, too!}
<A>__{sam's out of control, the whole shop stares at him as he backs into a shelf of mugs he so carefully arranged. they crash onto the floor.}
