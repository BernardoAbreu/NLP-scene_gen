<A>__{spaulding swabs up the last remains of blood from the floor, he drops the mop into a bucket filled with water and blood. bill pays no attention, he is distracted by a strange object in a glass case over the counter. in the case is a shriveled up looking half human and half fish figure. it is the size of a small child. a banner above reads: aqualina the mermaid.}
