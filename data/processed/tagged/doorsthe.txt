<D>__{aw right. let's get some tacos!}
<A>__{he stands, sways, than moves out of view. the empty bottle of whiskey, its sands run out, is left behind. as we fade out: , a hardy, mischievous morrison laugh and a ripple of sensuous music carry us into the lilting, lamenting strains of an american prayer the end without lyrics for now as we cut to:}

<A>__{pamela is agitated in her sleep waking as she feels him watching. is that him? at the door? a shadow leaves. footsteps moving down the narrow parisian corridor with the creaky floor.}
<C>__{pam}
<D>__{jim... that you?}
<A>__{looks at the time. somewhere near dawn. the sounds of a bath being drawn. nightmare or sleep? she tries to fade back to sleep but the music and the whispering prod her, pull her awake... dissolve: same face an hour later. putting her robe on, the slippers, the light... moving. she is much more ravaged looking than before.}
<L>__{interior bathroom dawn}
<A>__{she finds him now... his face floating upwards, angelic eyes, the beard is now gone, a little smile on his face. he must be playing another joke. although she really knows as she says the words:}
<C>__{pam}
<D>__{jim! it was you. i always know when it's you.}

<D>__{jim morrison, now you stop joking you hear me, cut it out!}
<A>__{his face. at peace, as she sobs, the music cresting to jim's lyrics.}
<C>__{pam}
<D>__{...was it all right jim, did you enjoy it when it came my baby? just like you said it'd be?}
<C>__{jim}

<D>__{they are waiting to take us into the severed garden do you know how pale and wanton thrillful comes death at a strange hour? unannounced unplanned for like a scaring overfriendly guest you've brought to bed? death makes angels of us all? and gives us wings where we had shoulders smooth as raven's claws...}

<L>__{exterior pere lachaise cemetery paris day}
<A>__{his face etching into a perfect alexandrine bust of physical beauty. the camera moving to reveal, a wintry day, leaves blowing, the wild cats everywhere in the empty cemetery, the crumbling tombs, the flowers fresh and dead around jim's tomb, the graffiti, wine bottles, wilde, bizet, piaf, chopin, morrison...}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(over)}
<D>__{no more money, no more fancy dress this other kingdom seems by far the best until its other jaw reveals incest and loose obedience to a vegetable law. i will not go i prefer a feast of friends to the giant family...}
<A>__{the music rolling up on:}
<L>__{interior corridor & stage limbo}
<A>__{smoke. some lights. the distant cheers of a crowd. in slightly slow motion, a figure moves down a corridor into a blinding light of stage and smoke. three other shadows are there waiting as the ghost moves to the microphone in altered motion. the audience is out there somewhere in the dark we sense they too have become ghosts, as all of us will one day. the music continuing up to roll from american prayer the end snatches we annotate.}

<A>__{camera closing past the doors to jim alone, circling the mike with his dance the indian ghostman jigging, shaman like, off to the side now levitating above the stage, all crazy, gawky dancing.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{well, i will tell you a story of whiskey, mystics and men and about the believers and how the whole thing began first there were women and children obeying the moon then daylight brought wisdom and sickness too soon... the moon is a dry blood beast we have assembled inside this ancient and insane theatre to propagate our lust for life and flee the swarming wisdom of the streets we live we die and death not ends it}
