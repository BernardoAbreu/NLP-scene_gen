<L>__{interior it's raining men strip joint night}
<A>__{hawk's at a bar stool gulping sloppily and woozily from a rocks glass. four more empty rocks glasses sit in front of him. he stares at the sexy woman who smiles back, blowing him kisses from the other side of the bar. the emcee enters the stage.}
<C>__{emcee}
<P>__{(into microphone)}
<D>__{okay, ladies, hang onto your hormones. here comes our next amateur. let's have a big hand for hawk!}
<A>__{the beginning of a rockin' kiss tune comes over the p.a. and dicky approaches hawk.}
<C>__{emcee}
<D>__{you're up, hawk.}
<A>__{hawk wakes up fast. there's nothing more sobering than having to undress in public.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{oh, dicky, i c c can't...}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{you're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? we've got your kiss song playing and everything.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{i i c can't...}
<C>__{bartender}
<P>__{(leans in close)}
<D>__{look, people undress in public because, a, they're exhibitionists, b, they're nutcases, or c, they need the money. i can tell you're not a, and i hope to hell you're not b. so my suggestion is, think about why you're a c and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.}
<A>__{hawk thinks about it, then downs the rest of his drink. he grimaces at it's taste, then opens his eyes with new resolve.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{you're right, dicky. i gotta do it for kiss. gotta put a bag over its head and}
<P>__{(hiccup)}
<D>__{do it for kiss.}
<A>__{hawk swivels his bar stool to the right and gets off, forgetting to stand when his feet hit the floor. he proceeds to fall flat on his face. dicky looks down concerned, but hawk stands with a little difficulty and heads for the stage. the crowd of women parts down the middle for him and checks him out as he walks by. they seem to like what they see. hawk looks nervously at the carnivorous faces leering at his package first, his ass after. what the hell is he doing? hawk reluctantly climbs onto the stage and the gals start clapping to the song. he faces them and starts gyrating his drunken hips at them, feeling no confidence whatsoever, until... the cheers start to echo and the pulsing lights begin to hurt his eyes. hawk watches the world proceed to spin faster than the disco ball above his head. he stops gyrating and clutches his stomach. belching. uh oh. hawk spots an almost empty beer pitcher one of the cheering in slow motion women holds above her head. he runs up to the edge of the stage, grabs the pitcher, and pukes. the cheering and music come to a grinding halt. you can hear a pin drop as hawk yacks his guts out into the beer pitcher. it goes on for an excruciatingly long time, then finally stops. hawk looks up at the hundreds of astonished eyes staring at him. he wipes his mouth, then a look of ease washes over his face.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{wow. i feel a hundred times better!}
<A>__{he hands the vomit filled pitcher back to the shocked woman.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{thanks lady.}
<A>__{he looks over at the emcee, who gazes at hawk from the dj booth.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{maestro? as you were.}
<A>__{the emcee stands perfectly still, jaw agape.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{come on, dude, we got a bunch of frisky felines waiting for some entertainment! the show must go on!}
<A>__{hawk starts gyrating even though the music is still off. the emcee shrugs, re cuing the song. it starts again as hawk faces the crowd, dancing with new found bravado. the women come out of their dumbstruck comas and reluctantly start clapping again. hawk pulls off his jacket and twirls it over his head roger daltry style. then he pulls it back down and tosses it into the crowd. the women actually fight over it. encouraged, hawk then peels off his kiss army tee shirt and hurls it at the women, who squeal with delight. sure, he may be scrawny, but they don't mind. this lad's got personality. adrenaline pumping, confidence building, hawk starts playing the crowd of very responsive ladies. he unbuttons his jeans first. then, leaving them on, he does an "air guitar" medley: chuck berry, zz top, angus young from ac dc, and elvis costello in six easy steps. hawk finishes off with a pete townshend windmill, shaking his ass at his audience in mid strum, then licks his finger and touches one of his cheeks: "hot stuff" (he does this in a manly way of course). then hawk pauses to adjust what looks to be his underwear bunching up in his crack. the women whoo hoo. he segues into a mick jagger rooster strut and the ladies go ga ga. he makes the sign of the horns with each hand and wiggles a protruding tongue like gene simmons. the gals scream in orgastic joy. then, hawk goes for the gold. yes, he does the fonzie dance! the women are now overcome by sheer animal lust. hawk's whipped his audience into a frenzied pack of bitches in heat. amanda smirks and sucks from her little drink straw suggestively. at long last hawk figures he has to give them what they want. he puts his fingers to his fly, pauses, then unzips. his brittanias fall to his ankles, revealing a pair of bony legs sticking down from some kiss boxer shorts. the ladies go batty. unfortunately hawk has neglected a cardinal rule of disrobing. never pull your pants down without taking your shoes off first. he tries to kick off his shoes. the left one goes flying across the bar and thwack, beans a middle aged woman in the face. she flies backwards over a chair. trying to kick the other shoe off, hawk loses his balance and falls backwards, hitting his head on the edge of the bar.}
