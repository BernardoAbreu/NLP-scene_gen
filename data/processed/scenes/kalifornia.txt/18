<L>__{exterior lucky street grill}
<A>__{a relic from the fifties with large glass windows. the rain has stopped but the streets are still wet. early's piece of shit grand prix pulls into the lot. he gets out and walks into the diner.}
<L>__{interior diner night}
<A>__{the place is almost empty. early, still wet from the rain, walks to the counter and sits down. he calls out to the kitchen.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{coffee and a bowl of chili, please.}
<C>__{waitress }
<D>__{...be right there.}
<A>__{the only other customer is an old man, sitting at the counter nearby nursing a cup of coffee. his face half hidden under a rain soaked hat. early selects a tune from the countertop juke box. old man's pov out of the corner of his eye he sees a bug (from the concrete block) crawl out of early's sleeve and onto the counter.}
<C>__{old man}
<P>__{(from beneath his shadowy brim...)}
<D>__{the antichrist'll be a woman, in a man's body. seven heads and seven tails.}
<A>__{early gazes at the old man curiously, then calls out to the waitress...}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{make that to go.}
<A>__{early notices the small bug crawling across the counter. he leans closer to it and watches it. after a moment, he thwacks it off the counter with his thumb and finger. the bug lands on the hot iron griddle with a sizzle! early glances at the old man again... then scoots over one stool closer to him. early seems curious to want to get a glimpse under the brim of the old man's hat.}
<B>__{in the back kitchen area}
<A>__{the waitress is bagging early's order to go... when the front door slams shut!}
<B>__{front dining area}
<A>__{the waitress re enters the room. it's empty. neither the old man nor early are there. with early's food in hand, she makes her way along the rear of the counter toward the front door. she glances around curiously. on the griddle, the remains of something black and charred smoulders. closer to the entrance, she stares at the front door. the sign that hangs in its window has been turned... the backside which faces her reads "open."}
<B>__{at the front door}
<A>__{she wonders about the sign for a moment, then stares curiously out the window... not a soul in sight. she locks the door and begins closing up for the night. she turns to make her way to the rear of the diner then notices something. slowly she moves along the side wall, past a number of highbacked booths.}
<B>__{her pov}
<A>__{sitting on one of the funky old leather seats in a booth are a pair of red high heeled shoes (the same pair worn earlier by the pretty teenage girl). the waitress glances nervously about the interior. no one in sight.}
<B>__{at the booth}
<A>__{she reaches down slowly and picks up the pair of shoes. looks at them closely. stares at the inside lining. then suddenly out of the quiet... a voice.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{...size 6.}
<A>__{the waitress spins a startled look to the booth beyond hers! early leans out from behind the highback partition.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{that's right ain't it, size 6?}
<A>__{the waitress... smiles, nods shyly.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{happy birthday adele.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{early, you are so sweet.}
<A>__{this is adele corners. she's 17, pretty, uneducated and early's girlfriend. she steps over to him, gives him a kiss, then sits down on the seat across from him. she starts to try on her new shoes.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{i feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{well dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.}
<A>__{she passes the bag to early. he digs in. between bites, he glances over to adele who's enthusiastically pulling on the new shoes.}
