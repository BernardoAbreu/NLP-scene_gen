<A>__{she rushes to the bedroom, where she finds the coils of cut rope.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{corky!}
<A>__{she looks at the wall separating the apartment.}
<L>__{interior hall night}
<A>__{caesar half falls out of the stair door, drenched with sweat.}
<L>__{interior empty apartment}
<A>__{gun ready, caesar throws open the door. spread out like a pond of milk is the spilled paint, but the money is gone. leading away from the white pool are boot prints and the drip trail of the plastic bag. the tracks lead to the bathroom. caesar kicks open the bathroom door and finds the bag of money next to corky's empty boots. over his shoulder we see corky already swinging a massive pipe wrench. at the last second he is able to duck, falling to the ground as the doorjamb splinters with a terrible metal crunch. before he can recover and shoot, she brings the wrench down on his arm. he screams as the gun hits the floor. she kicks it, sending it skidding, hydroplaning across the paint pool to the other side, leaving a jet trail of white swirls and spirals on the wood floor. they fight, corky raining blows onto his back and flailing arm until he catches her foot, flipping her as he clambers up. scrambling across the paint, slipping, crawling for the gun when violet bursts in, pointing the gun from the freezer.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{caesar, on hands and knees, looks at her, then at his gun still out of reach.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{it's over, caesar. i called mickey. he's on his way.}
<A>__{violet stands for long time, the gun trained carefully on him as he rises from the floor. panting, caesar watches her like a mad dog.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{get out of here, caesar. if you want to live you had better start running.}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{all these years and you still don't know me, violet.}
<A>__{she glances down and sees the paint covered gun.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{but i know you.}
<A>__{he turns to the gun.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{caesar, don't.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{what are you going to do, v? shoot me? kill me in cold blood? i don't think so. i will tell you why. if you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago. if i was you, i would have killed me the minute i brought the money home. but you didn't and i know why, because you don't want to kill me. do you, v? do you? no, i know you don't.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{caesar, you don't know shit.}
<A>__{violet fires the bullet hits caesar in the shoulder, knocking him off balance. another doubles him over as blood speckles the pool of painterior she empties the gun into him. his body arcs back, falling, splashing into the painterior caesar's blood bubbles out bright red against the glistening white.}
