<A>__{ray hacks a rose bush down to the nub. from the garage comes the sound of an engine turning over. wilkins' 1973 lincoln continental convertible lurches down the drive with claude at the wheel. he screeches to a halt inches from ray's legs and climbs from the car.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{don't touch that car.}
<A>__{claude pulls out a hanky and buffs ray's finger print off the hood.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! where you taking him?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{greenville. we're picking up the new superintendent at the bus station.}
<A>__{ray scowls as claude straightens his chauffeur uniform and heads up the path to the mansion.}
