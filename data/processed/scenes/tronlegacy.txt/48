<L>__{exterior game portal outpost}
<A>__{obsolete, abandoned computer game entry portal, guarding entry to the old game grid beyond. an electro tech carnival zone gone dark. no life in sight... then: beam of data energy sling shots at ground level, solidifying to become: a slender, jumpy program called i beem. he wears the x net logo and a cracked disk on his back. he's highly unstable and way unplugged from the system (like one of those japanese soldiers still fighting alone in the hills 10 years after wwii was over). i beem sees something he panics, zapping away in characteristic streaks of airborne data. he reassembles in a hiding place, skittish, observing: rush, mega, krod and d rezz arrive. see giant pile of game vehicle parts blocking access to the grid. rush picks up an old light wand. krod finds one too.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{d rezz. cut a path.}
<A>__{d rezz hurls his romball, zaps into vehicle parts. a dent.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{that's good. keep doing it.}
<A>__{d rezz retrieves romball for another whack zap data energy beam snaps in front of them, becoming i beem. he grips his rickety disk, challenging them.}
<D>__{i beem violation! go away! access denied!}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{relax, buddy }
<A>__{mega scans i beem. he freaks, drops his disk, grabs for it.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{pound him to bits, d rezz.}
<A>__{d rezz raises his romball to pulverize i beem. i beem freaks, zaps away in his data beam as romball crashes down. i beem reforms further way, then beside them he snatches his pancake disk, the zaps away again, emerging then high on the pile of parts.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{he's wireless.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{freaky.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{searching data bank. "i beem". security specialist, damaged in service, rated unstable. i beem}
<P>__{(ranting from above)}
<D>__{"unstable"! like they aren't?! they booted me off x net! i will show them! i'm doing my subroutine out here! nobody gets through this portal!}
<A>__{he kicks parts avalanche fills the gap d rezz blasted.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{d rezz, take out this blip.}
<A>__{d rezz cocks romball. i beem freaks, sling shots all over the place via his data beam, tossing his wobbly disk. rush catches i beem's disk. holds off d rezz.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{hang on. i beem. we're from x net cpu. you're doing a great job out here. everybody knows it.}
<A>__{mega throws rush a look. i beem comes up, grateful.}
<D>__{i beem they do?!}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{that's right. now, have you seen a rogue program around here? he's red. super fast. known as "tron".}
<A>__{data zags to rush, forming into: i beem. wide eyed.}
<D>__{i beem the red one! that illegal function! he blasts through here and jumps over the top! i tell him access denied he jumps right over like i was never there!}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{when did he come through last? i beem right before you got here.}
<A>__{rush trades looks with mega, krod and d rezz. trail is hot.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{i beem, we've got a plan to shut down that red violator. you're going to help us. i beem let me at him!}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{first, you've got to let us onto the game grid.}
<A>__{i beem stiffens, reflexively vigilant. he scans the four of them again, finally softening. he zaps to a wall near his giant barrier, then proudly pushes aside a thin panel. beyond a corridor of game gear, view expanses to reveal:}
