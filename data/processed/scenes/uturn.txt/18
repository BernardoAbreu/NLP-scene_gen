<L>__{interior grace's living room day}
<A>__{grace is standing on a step ladder trying to hang the drapes. bobby notices a photo of grace with an older indian woman, her mother?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{hold me.}
<A>__{bobby stands behind her, gently places his hands on grace's waist.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{tighter. i won't break. you know girls are a lot tougher than men think.}
<A>__{bobby holds her tighter as she finished hanging the drapes. his eyes are transfixed on her ass.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{there. all done. lift me down.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{lift me down.}
<A>__{bobby lifts grace down from the ladder. he holds her, his hands around her waist.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you can let go of me now. i'm safe.(with a wicked smile) how do they look?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{like you.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{beautiful?}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{like they're made of polyester.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i like them. i was sick of looking at this room. i think they add a little life.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{nothing like a little liveliness.}
<A>__{with a sexy pout grace loads the next question.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{no more drapes to hang. now what should we do?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i have an idea.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{and what would that be?}
<A>__{bobby steps close to grace and takes her by the shoulders. he pulls her to him and presses his lips hard to hers. grace doesn't respond.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{all right, grace. no more games.}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{games?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you flirt with me, then you run cold. you lead me on, then slap me down. i don't go for being jerked around.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{really? and what game did you want to play? you carry my box for me, and i fall into bed with you?}
<A>__{bobby grabs up his pack.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i think i can find my own way back to into town.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{maybe i like to find out about a man first. maybe i like to know what he's made of.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i'm just flesh and blood, baby. that and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys. but you already know that. you read my mind, remember? thanks for the lemonade.}
<A>__{bobby turns to leave.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you never did answer my question.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{still playing?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{that's not an answer. what is it you want?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you know what i want.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{maybe i just want to hear you say it.}
<A>__{for a beat bobby stands and stares hard at grace. his pack slides from his shoulder and thuds on the floor. with great determination, like a beast closing for the kill, bobby moves for her. grace stands firm, ready for him; her head tilts back. her breath comes deep and hard. just as bobby is about to reach her, just as he is about to take her, he is stopped dead by the booming voice of jake mckenna.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{grace!}
<A>__{bobby turns to face jake: an older man, still large and formidable for his age.}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{jake. i thought you...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{who the hell is this!?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{who the hell are you?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i'm her husband.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{husband ...?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or god help me i will break you in half.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{easy, chief. i... i was helping your wife. i met her in town. she needed a hand with her drapes. that's all.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i swear to you that's all that happened. i haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{a lot that means.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{grace, tell him.}
<A>__{grace says nothing. she picks up a glass of lemonade and sips at it coolly.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{damn it, grace! tell him.}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{if he says that's what happened, jake, it must be true.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{oh yeah, and i suppose you didn't have anything to do with it grace, he just wandered up here by hisself. i got a mind to put you over my knee and paddle your ass raw !}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{you bitch! is this what it's all about? you sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you? you both... forget it! (heads for the}
<P>__{door)}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{where you going!}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{'scuse me, you want to take my head off, mister. i won't even try to stop you. i deserve it for being an idiot. but if you're not, i think i will be on my way... ow!}
<A>__{jake punches him in the nose.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! i'm gonna tear you a new asshole!}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you broke my nose!}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{it ain't broke.}
<A>__{it probably isn't, but it bleeds. bobby feels the blood and then sees it on his shirt.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{goddamn it! i'm... you're lucky i don't sue you.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{get goin' junior.}
<A>__{bobby glares back at grace who gives him a maddening little smile.}

<D>__{you people are crazy!}
<A>__{he storms out holding his nose.}
