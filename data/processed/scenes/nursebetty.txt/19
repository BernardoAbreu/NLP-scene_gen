<L>__{interior betty's house day}
<A>__{a low end ranch. a worn out sofa and loveseat form an 'l' that dominates the living room. romance novels line a small bookcase. six canaries in cages chatter away in the kitchen. del sits at the dining room table, agitated. he is presently attacking a pork chop, baked beans and a loaf of wonderbread. all we hear is a fork clicking and birds chirping. betty stands at the breakfast counter, barefoot, still in her uniform and quietly eating a salad.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{sure you don't want any salad?}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{no, i do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new buicks?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i told you. sue ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{she's not comfortable in a corsica? 's got air and leather...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i took the blue corsica, del. relax.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{all right, then. actually, i'm glad you're going out. i got something going on tonight. some serious clients, with real potential.}
<A>__{del belches, smiles, then clucks at the birds nearby.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{... like the water purifiers?}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{or the vitamins? or the...?}
<A>__{del almost comes out of his chair, pointing his finger at her.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{hey, the fda screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{anyway, 'least i try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i got you, del...}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{... well, then you ain't got much.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{oh, i know.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so, who're these clients?}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{couple 'a guys in from outta town. they want to see the new lesabres.}
<A>__{betty hides her reaction.}
<C>__{del }
<D>__{and i don't need sue ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{just knock it off, 'kay? anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{they're new to us...}
<A>__{truce for a moment. del plucks a copy of soap opera guide from betty's purse while absently taking a bite from betty's cupcake. he narrowly misses the candle.}
<C>__{del }
<D>__{jesus... you know these actors are mainly models, which are mainly fags. they've done studies. the rest're assholes. but you know what bugs me most about these soaps?}
<A>__{she silently mimics him as he says...}
<C>__{del }
<D>__{it's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{yeah, i guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, del?}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{that is a skill!}
<A>__{del lurches to his feet and crosses to the bird cages as the canaries chirp and sing excitedly at his approach.}
<C>__{del }
<D>__{daddy's here, babies... daddy's here.}
<P>__{(to betty)}
<D>__{be back later... clean up.}
<A>__{he exits. she collects his dirty dishes, puts them in the sink and starts to wash them. then she stops.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{what the hell am i doing?}
<A>__{she drops the dishes with a clatter, pours herself a glass of wine, lights the candle on her deflowered cupcake and opens the one card on the table.}
<B>__{close on}
<A>__{a traditional greeting from her grandparents. red hearts and lace. a color photo of them enclosed. betty smiles at this. after moment, she quietly sings a quick refrain of "happy birthday" to herself.}
