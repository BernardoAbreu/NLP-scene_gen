<P>__{(on telephone)}
<D>__{yes. i'm still holding. where are you again? new dehli? oh.}
<A>__{john stares at his book, shaking his head. waits for a few seconds. sigrid is in the background, doing light housekeeping, trying not to listen, but obviously can't avoid it.}
<C>__{john }
<P>__{(on telephone)}
<D>__{butzin. john k. butzin. right. that's me. roaring lion. yes. well, i have a copy of my book you sent, but there must be some mistake...well, you put a dog on the cover. not a lion like we agreed.}
<A>__{john holds the book up for the camera to catch the unmistakable dog barking on the front cover.}
<C>__{john }
<P>__{(on telephone)}
<D>__{plus the back cover is written in chinese. chinese...yes, i know chinese when i see it. one of those chinese assault rifles almost cost me an eye at hamburger hill...}
<A>__{john listens trying to remain calm.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{i seem to be missing pages 1 0 7 to 1 1 2...yes, i'm sure. and what in blazes is this chapter eight?}
<A>__{sigrid keeps cleaning. stoic expression.}
<C>__{john }
<P>__{(on telephone)}
<D>__{this chapter eight isn't mine. it's about hormone replacement for women. do you think john k. butzin would write that? must be from another goddamn book. so what the hell you going to do about this? you, sir, are dealing with a decorated veteran a combat veteran of the united states army.}
<A>__{john waits for an explanation.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{yes. i will hold.}
<A>__{john looks again at his book in disbelief. then he remembers the camera. forces a faint smile.}
<C>__{john }
<P>__{(to camera)}
<D>__{minor details. that's all. all that truly matters is that john k. butzin is finally a published author.}
<A>__{but catch sigrid's expression. she is quiet. more than a little concerned at what she is hearing.}
