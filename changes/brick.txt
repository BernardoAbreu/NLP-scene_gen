Brendan picks up a broken chunk of concrete from the ground, waddles over to the car and holds the chunk above his head, ready to drop it through the window. He stops. His eyes catch something in the distance. The lanky shaved-head kid, whose name is Tugger.   Coming towards him fast. Brendan stands there for a moment, then lets the chunk fall to the ground. He casually leans against the car, removes his glasses, puts them in a hard case and puts the hard case in his pocket. Tugger hits him like a train and throws him across the pavement. Tug turns back to the car and takes out his keys. Brendan gets up and comes towards Tug, his face stiff. Tug turns and pops him once squarely in the mouth. Brendan falls to his knees. While Tug unlocks the door Brendan stands up woozily. Grunting, Tug spins and grabs Brendan's jacket, pushing him back while he slaps him hard in the face, back and forth, three times. When Tug lets go Brendan drops like a stone, catching himself on his hands and knees. The car door slams. The mustang drives about a hundred yards out into the parking lot, spins around and stops, facing Brendan. Its motor purrs deeply. Brendan begins to limp towards it doggedly, head up, eyes fixed. A crackling roar and short squeal of tires spit the mustang forward. It comes straight at Brendan, rumbling like a tank. Brendan stops walking and stands very still, eyes steady. The gap between him and the car closes in no time at all. It speeds past him not six inches to his left, brushing the edge of his jacket. Brakes squeal behind him. Brendan turns and lopes towards the mustang, idling about fifty feet away. He stops at the window.   Tugger eyes him curiously, with some respect.}

Meanwhile maybe you're getting bored, maybe just greedy, so when the Pin scores big with the bricks you take your shot. You hook one, take half, and cut it back to size, but you cut it bad.
