<A>__{scotty lies in bed, surrounded by vintage sexploitation movie posters that decorate his walls ("garden of eden", "mud honey", "there she blows"), and watches on video the ridiculous 70's trash film "double agent '73" starring chesty morgan. in the credit sequence he sees miss morgan "photographing" men with her humongous breasts that supposedly have cameras implanted inside. scotty is getting turned on. he runs to lock bedroom door, closes curtain on window and then hops under a blanket to commit the sin of self abuse.}
