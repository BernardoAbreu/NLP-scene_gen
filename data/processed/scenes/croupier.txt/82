<D>__{jack had no idea where marion was staying, or with whom. he realised he knew little about her life. but then, he had never asked about it.}
<A>__{jack now sees marion. he is about to go up to her, moving through the flow of the crowd, then he stops. a man in his 30s, tall with a moustache, greets marion. he's been waiting for her. jack watches the two of them, unseen. the man and marion exchange a few words. she smiles, takes his arm. he leans forward to kiss her.}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{for the first time in a long while jack thought about his mother. she'd left when she couldn't take it any more. his father had said 'don't worry, jacko, she'll come back.' she didn't.}
<A>__{jack turns and walks away.}
