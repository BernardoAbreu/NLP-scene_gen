<A>__{frank steps into a tiled room that overlooks the pool area. one wall is all glass. on the opposite wall are shelves containing the trophies of rachel marron's career: a tony award, three grammy's, gold and platinum records, other statuettes and plaques. among the framed photo graphs of rachel accepting awards etc., is one of her and her small son, fletcher, dressed in a tuxedo. both are goofing off for the camera with obvious affection. frank looks down at the pool. frank's pov dwarfed by the pool, the only person in sight is seven year old fletcher, the little boy from the photograph, dark haired and fragile. he is crouched at the side of the pool with the remote control unit for a foot long speedboat which is cutting across the water. a nanny sits, some way off, embroidering. frank's attention is distracted. a heavier bass musical beat comes from somewhere nearby in the house, another rachel marron number, but this time up tempo and bouncy. frank follows the sound.}
