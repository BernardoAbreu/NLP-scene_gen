<A>__{ordell walks around the car, climbs into the plush interior of the olds and turns on the engine. it comes to life with a soft rumble. he puts a tape in the player inside the dash. the tape is labeled "ordell's jams." cool, old school r&b fills the cab. ordell cruises, moving his head to the rhythm and mouthing the words. he drives for awhile, just groovin' on the music... ... then stops. ordell switches the engine and the music off. the cab goes black. he leans over the passenger seat, opening the glovebox. a tiny light turns on when the glovebox is opened. it's the only light in the cab. ordell leaves it on. in silence he takes one glove out and puts it on his right hand. then with his gloved hand, reaches in the glovebox and pulls out a five shot .38 snubby. he closes the glovebox. the cab goes black.}
