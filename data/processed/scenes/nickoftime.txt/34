<D>__{her name? her name is lynn.}
<A>__{eleanor grant writes the autograph. mr. smith's eyes drill into him. gene looks over. mr. smith raises a hand to his face, pretends to scratch an itch. his other hand taps his wristwatch. gene's hand slides toward his jacket pocket. sweat beads on his forehead. he's barely aware of krista talking to him.}
<C>__{krista}
<D>__{it's funny. i don't even keep a pad of paper with me anymore, everything's gone so electronic.}

<C>__{krista}
<D>__{if it wasn't for double a batteries i'd be in big trouble.}
<A>__{he is slowly reaching into the pocket with the gun, but stops when he notices mr. smith's hand slide into his jacket, where his gun is. he looks at the other mr. smith, earphone, crewcut security. there is the hint of a gun on his hip. gene's eyes widen, dart to mr. smith's face, his hand sliding into his coat. his hand hovers over his gun, trembling. is the security man staring at him? eleanor grant hands over the autograph.}
<C>__{eleanor grant}
<D>__{are you all right? elevators make me queasy, too.}
<A>__{gene gives her a sick smile, abruptly turns away. he takes his hand out of his pocket. it's shaking. he clenches it to stop the shakes. the doors open, startling him.}
