<A>__{as they walk the great glowing dome is visible in the distance. the old man marvels at what he sees...they walk on. long, long angle logan jessica and the old man day walking up the beach toward the domed city. we get an idea of the scale. they appear as ants in front of redwood trees.}
<B>__{out}
<A>__{logan, jessica and the old man approaching. the wave power inlet in f.g. they hear: the roar of the water as they approach cautiously...they see:}
<B>__{wave power inlet}
<A>__{waves pounding over acres of strange stepped construction...}
<B>__{descending to a vortex.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{what does that water do?}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{it's part of the hydrogalvanic system. the ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{is it inside the city?}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{of course.}

<P>__{(after a beat; to the old man)}
<D>__{we're going to try and get in this way. i don't think you can make it.}
<C>__{old man}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{oh...i did so look forward to seeing all those people.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{old man}

<C>__{old man}
<D>__{oh, my...}
<A>__{the old man watches logan and jessica dive into the pool and disappear.}
<B>__{the old man}
<A>__{he bends and plays with the water in the pool for a moment...like a young child at a pond or lake.}
