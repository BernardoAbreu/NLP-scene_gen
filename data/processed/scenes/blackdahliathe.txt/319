<L>__{exterior the sprague mansion morning}
<A>__{bucky edges his way along the side of the house. a side window is open and he pulls himself inside.}
<L>__{interior the mansion continuous}
<A>__{moving boxes fill the front hallway. bucky hears voices coming from the main hall. madeleine and emmett. bucky unholsters his gun; from his pocket he pulls out a silencer and screws it on the muzzle.}
<C>__{emmett sprague }
<D>__{...besides, one of my foremen said the goddamn pipes are spewing gas...there'll be hell to pay. it's about time i showed the three of you good ol' scotland.}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{i don't wanna go to europe, daddy. you're always talking about how dreadful and provincial it is.}
<C>__{emmett sprague}
<D>__{...they've got what you need, lassie.}
<A>__{bucky steps into the main room, gun prominent at his side.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{and what is that, emmett? saps like me? direct line to the straight dope? or is that what you needed?}
<C>__{emmett sprague}
<D>__{aaah, laddie.}
<A>__{he eyes the gun.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{george tilden killed elizabeth short and the two of you covered it up.}
<A>__{on the spragues, trying to maintain their upper class cool.}
<C>__{bucky }
<P>__{(to madeleine)}
<D>__{you helped linda martin and betty make that stag film. where was the set? in one of daddy's old buildings?}
<A>__{he levels the gun at madeleine. rock steady. madeleine sits on a divan.}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{georgie was always...sneaking around daddy's properties. he saw them make it...he...got crazy about betty.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{of course. she looked like his daughter.}
<A>__{off emmett's shocked look:}
<C>__{bucky }
<D>__{he fucked your wife. but i don't think you cared about that. but he's her daddy. and that must have made you crazy. he was a handsome bastard, too. somehow i don't think he was disfigured in a car wreck.}
<C>__{emmett sprague}
<D>__{in the argonne, georgie used to bayonet the dead gerries. i saw it. thrilled him, it did. he was...hmm...disturbed. i think ramona found him...a good way to strike back at me.}
<A>__{bucky points the gun at madeleine again.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{how'd it all go down?}
<A>__{she hesitates. he shoots a ming vase next to her. she jumps.}
<C>__{bucky }
<D>__{so many pretty things here...}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{it was sunday i remember...betty called...short of cash as usual. i put daddy on, and he offered betty money to date a nice man he knew. georgie'd been driving daddy crazy, wanting to get with betty ever since the movie. threatening to tell people he was my father. but we thought georgie just wanted her for sex.}
<A>__{bucky blows away another objet d'art. the two spragues huddle on the couch.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{he was a sick fuck and you knew it!}
<A>__{emmett gestures vainly towards the stuffed dog balto.}
<C>__{emmett sprague}
<D>__{he was passive. he liked to touch dead things. his father was a surgeon, did you know that? famous in scotland.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{what did you tell betty? what did you tell her?}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{we said he was a war hero. because we didn't want her to feel like a whore.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{then?}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{you know the rest.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{pretend i'm stupid. for old time's sake.}
<A>__{madeleine exhales hate.}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{i went looking for linda martin, and i found her at a motel in the valley. i gave her money and told her to say the stag was filmed in tijuana with a mexican crew.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{and then what? i come along? daddy tell you to fuck me or was that your idea?}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{bucky }
<A>__{two more shots from the gun destroy another fifty grand worth of art. bucky reloads.}
<C>__{bucky }
<D>__{the whole family have a good laugh at dinner that night? pumping me for info about the case? throwing me georgie stories to see if i'd bite? a little hospitality and some cunt so i wouldn't check out your alibi }
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{bucky }
<C>__{emmett sprague}
<D>__{ramona didn't know a thing. martha }
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{what about sweet little martha?}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{martha knew i'd been with betty. but that was all. but she's a demon, you know. she even called the cops with a tip on la verne's just hoping i'd get smeared in the papers. i scratched her good for that.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{martha tell you this?}
<A>__{she nods yes.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{then she lied to get your goat, 'cuz no one ever called in a tip on laverne's.}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{figures.}
<A>__{emmett clears his throat.}
<C>__{emmett sprague}
<D>__{what are you gonna do?}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{passports. all four.}
<A>__{emmett walks to a small desk. he reaches into the drawer bucky puts his gun to emmett's head }
<C>__{emmett sprague}
<D>__{don't insult me, lad.}
<A>__{he pulls out the four passports (not a gun). bucky takes them.}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{we'll ruin you in court, you know. if you go after us, we'll ruin you. over what? some little slut }
<A>__{bucky blows a hole in a vase some six inches from her. he cocks his head at her, as if to say: the next one will be closer.}
<C>__{emmett sprague}
<D>__{you know, laddie. the rich don't necessarily own art just for themselves; we safekeep it for future generations.}
<A>__{the dig crosses through bucky's mind for a moment before he shooes it away. to emmett:}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{i need to see it.}
<C>__{emmett sprague}
<D>__{it?}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{just to be sure. i need to see it.}
<C>__{emmett sprague}
<D>__{i'm not sure i know...}
<A>__{bucky puts the silenced muzzled half an inch from sprague's brain.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{i need to see his grave, you tightass kiltwearing motherfucker. where'd you bury george tilden?}
