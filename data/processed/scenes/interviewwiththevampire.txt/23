<L>__{interior dining room night}
<A>__{louis and lestat sitting at a sumptuous table, piled with uneaten food. lestat is going through sheafs of documents.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{i awoke the next evening to a different world. and i realized there are as profound differences between vampires as between human beings...}
<A>__{lestat, totting up figures on a piece of paper.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{your wealth, dear louis, is inestimable. your income from cotton alone will keep us in comfort for a century.}
<A>__{louis just stares at him.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{i sat there staring at him with contempt. he had the soul of a shopkeeper, he was the sow's ear out of which nothing fine could be made. i felt sadly cheated in having him as a teacher...}
<A>__{lestat looks up at him and grins.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you'll get used to killing. just forget about that mortal coil. you'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{do you think so?}
<A>__{yvette enters, stands behind him, staring at lestat with loathing.}
<C>__{yvette}
<D>__{you are not hungry, sir...}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{au contraire, my dear. he could eat a horse...}
<A>__{lestat laughs loudly. louis turns and looks at yvette. her beautiful forehead in the candlelight, the veins pulsing on her neck and her hands.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{i looked at anything mortal and saw all life as precious, condemning all fruitless guilt and passion that would let it slip through the fingers like sand...}
<A>__{yvette returns his stare, troubled.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{it was only as a vampire that i could see yvette's beauty. her fear of me increased my desire.}
<A>__{yvette reaches for his uneaten plate. louis stops her hand. holds it for a beat too long, looking at the veins in her wrist.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i will finish it, yvette. now leave us.}
<A>__{she turns and runs from the table. lestat leans towards him.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{can't you pretend, you fool? don't give the game away. we're lucky to have such a home.}
<A>__{his hand snakes out under the table. it comes up holding a large grey rat.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{pretend to drink, at least.}
<A>__{he bares his fangs and slices the rat's throat. he pours the blood into a crystal glass.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{such fine crystal shouldn't go to waste...}
<A>__{he hands the glass to louis. louis drinks the blood and stares at it in surprise, then at the dead rat on the fine lace tablecloth.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{i know. it gets cold so fast.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{we can live like this? off the blood of animals?}
<A>__{lestat shrugs.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{i wouldn't call it living. i'd call it surviving. a useful trick if you're caught for a month on a ship at sea.}
<A>__{lestat strokes the belly of the dead rat, studying it sadly.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{there's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{fascination...}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{yes. and i'm bored with this prattle }
<A>__{he throws the rat away.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{but we can live without taking human life. it's possible.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{anything is possible. but just try it for a week. come into new orleans and let me show you some real sport!}
<A>__{he rises. louis follows.}
