<A>__{red is darning a sock in his open cell. he pauses, frowning, hearing strange thumping sounds. what the hell is that?}

<A>__{it's hadley and mert methodically and brutally pulping bogs with their batons, and kicking the shit out of him for good measure. he feebly tries to ward them off.}
<L>__{2nd tier}
<A>__{puzzled, red steps from his cell, following the sound. it dawns on him that it's coming from above. he moves to the railing and leans out, craning around to look up red's pov just as bogs flips over the railing and comes sailing directly toward us, eyes bugging out, screaming as he falls. red (slow motion) jumps back as bogs plummets past, missing him by inches, arms swimming and trying to grab the railing (but missing that too), screaming aaaaalll the way down }

<A>__{ and impacting on ernie's gassing mop cart in an enormous eruption of solvents and cleansers. the cart is squashed flat, shooting out from under bogs and skidding across the cellblock floor like a tiddly wink, kicking up sparks for thirty yards. ernie is left gaping in shock at bogs and all the bogs related wreckage at his feet.}
