<A>__{a sprawling glass and metal complex covering many city blocks. the entrance is a large plaza filled with people and}
<B>__{robots.}
<L>__{interior u.s. robotics metal corridor day}
<A>__{an elevator opens with a whoosh. spooner steps out into a featureless corridor. his footsteps, echoing. he stops at a set of opposing doors. looks over at one, when the other suddenly opens.}
<L>__{interior u.s. robotics plush conference room continuous}
<A>__{a warm, mahogany paneled room. in sharp contrast to the cold metal space outside. spooner steps inside. at the end of a long conference table sits an old man. sparkling blue eyes. old fashioned suit.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{hello, there. please come in.}
<A>__{spooner hesitates.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{it's alright. you can sit. sit.}
<A>__{spooner doesn't. looks around the room. the old man lifts up a coffee pot. pours some coffee into a single cup.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{coffee?}
<C>__{spooner}
<P>__{(interested)}
<D>__{you're offering me a cup of coffee?}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{yes. but you are to say, "no, thank you."}
<A>__{spooner nods a little. the old man raises the coffee to his lips, but doesn't take a sip.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{coffee?}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{no. thank you.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{as you wish.}
<A>__{the old man takes a sip. he doesn't move. there is no movement except for a whisper of steam rising from the coffee pot.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{you want to tell me something about dr. hogenmiller? about his death?}
<A>__{the old man smiles.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{i want to tell you that his death was not a suicide.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{and why do you say that?}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{why? because i want you to know it.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{i understand that. but what specifically leads you to believe that he didn't commit suicide?}
<C>__{old man}
<P>__{(considers)}
<D>__{nothing specifically.}
<A>__{spooner shifts his weight. agitated.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{under normal circumstances that wouldn't be enough to get you a homicide investigation.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{but this is not "normal circumstances," is it, detective spooner?}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{no. it isn't.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{then you will find out who killed dr. hogenmiller, yes? and then you will tell me.}
<A>__{spooner's losing his patience.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{if you were murdered, doctor, i will find out. and you'll be the first to know.....}
<A>__{just then the hologram of dr. hogenmiller vanishes in a burst of light, as does the table, the coffee pot, and the conference room. spooner, suddenly finds himself standing in front of a large view screen inside a small metal chamber.}
