<L>__{exterior webber's backyard late morning}
<A>__{ryan and adam are on their backs on rafts as robin swims laps between them. suddenly, like a ufo crashing to earth, sam's suitcase spirals downward straight into the pool, barely missing both adam and ryan.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no fucking way!!!}
<A>__{the boys are knocked off their rafts as robin takes off her goggles and focuses on sam up on his balcony.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{you liar! you stupid liar! i hate you!}
<A>__{george bursts out of the kitchen, onto the patio.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{no i'm not!}
<A>__{sam storms off the balcony, back into his room.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{what was i supposed to do? when you didn't show up saturday, i tried to call. your phone isn't working.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i don't have a phone.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i drove over and you were gone.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i can't leave the house?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{last time you were gone for a week!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{no. i was going to let you do that.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{he's not spending the summer in tahoe.}
<A>__{sam walks out of the kitchen to confront his father.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{who are you, anyway? i don't even know you.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you'll know me by the time we're through.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm not going!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i will get your bag.}
<A>__{george walks to the edge of the pool and scoops up the suitcase, holding it out as it drains.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{mom, tell him i'm not going. you already promised me!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you have everything?}
<A>__{robin is in an uncomfortable position as she glances at sam before focusing on george.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i did say he could go.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{let's go.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm not going!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you don't have a choice.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{mom...please.}
<A>__{sam's eyes well with tears as his voice cracks. robin is ready to concede.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{george }
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(adamant)}
<D>__{he's not spending the entire summer with another kid in tahoe. if he leaves, i will follow him up there and i will drag him home by his nose ring. he can hate me. you can hate me. he can try to kill me while i sleep. you can call the police. you can call your husband or your attorney, but sam is spending the summer with me. he's my son. he's sixteen. that's it.}
<A>__{sam is crying now snot's running down his nose. robin is shocked by george's forcefulness.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{can we hate you?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you can do anything you want.}
<A>__{george walks to sam and touches his arm.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{go get in the truck, sam.}
<A>__{sam jerks away from his dad as dramatically as he can manage.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{go fuck yourself!}
<A>__{george drops the suitcase and grabs sam by the arms. as much as sam tries to resist, he's clearly no match for his father.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{your nose ring comes out of your nose. if you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too. and there's no make up at my house. no glue sniffing. huffing. no pills, no grass.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{if you hit me, i will call the police.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you've worn out your welcome at this house, sam. i won't ever hit you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{this may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it. so, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck. now.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i will hate you forever.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you can't even begins to know how much i hate my father.}
<P>__{(upbeat)}
<D>__{think of it as a family tradition.}
<A>__{sam glares at his mother before grabbing his soggy suitcase and stomping out of the backyard. robin is stunned silent by george's decisiveness.}
