<L>__{int cadillac early evening}
<A>__{milo and cass are back on the highway, both looking a little worse for wear. milo's nose is swollen, cass' clothes are muddy. milo moves his weapons from the duffle into his own jacket while he drives. he smirks at cass.}
<C>__{cass}
<P>__{clever. (noting all the weapons)}
<D>__{wow. you were gonna use all that stuff on me?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{a guy can dream, can't he?}
<A>__{now his jacket is full of weapons. he turns his attention back to the road. cass studies his profile.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{ok, look, milo, let's just clear the air, ok? so maybe it was a mistake, thinking we could be involved while working on the same case...}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{hey, i know it was a mistake. don't think you're telling me something i don't know, cause you're not.}
<C>__{cass}
<P>__{(deep breath)}
<D>__{ok. fine. but can we just put aside our differences for two seconds? because back at the casino, i think i saw someone following me.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{sure that wasn't me?}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{i don't think so. this guy was lacking your trademark smell of booze and kfc.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{ha ha.}
<A>__{milo surreptitiously sniffs himself.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{anywho. if these dirty cops have my source hostage somewhere...}
<A>__{milo starts to laugh. cass flushes:}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{what's so funny?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{you think dirty cops are trying to kill you? look, i know you think you're hot shit and everything, but i'm pretty sure the only one around here who might want to kill you is me.}
<A>__{cass sees a dark chevy in the rearview mirror, gets a look at the driver and goes pale.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{oh no.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{behind us. it's him. the guy i saw back at the casino.}
<A>__{milo glances into the mirror, checking the guy out.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{yeah? he doesn't look like a cop to me.}
<C>__{cass}
<P>__{(freaking out)}
<D>__{speed up!}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{would you just calm down for a second and...}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{no!!}
<A>__{cass kicks a leg over and slams her foot onto the gas. the car leaps forward...}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{jesus christ...}
<A>__{milo tries to push her foot off the gas while they wrestle for the wheel. the car does a crazy zig zag back and forth...}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{listen, you maniac...}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{milo...}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{...let go...}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{milo...}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{...no one is trying to kill you...}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{milo!!!}
<A>__{she points past him. milo turns to see mahler driving beside them, gun pointed at milo's head.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{shit!!!}
<A>__{they both duck as mahler starts firing. glass shatters all around them. milo pulls out his gun and starts firing back...}
