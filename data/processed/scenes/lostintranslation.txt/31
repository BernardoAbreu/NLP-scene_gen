<D>__{oh, great. i will talk to you later, bye.}
<A>__{he hangs up. the make up artist dusts him with powder. the commercial people are crowding around. bob's chair is swivelled around and we see him in his tuxedo, wearing too much make up and some weird looking eyeliner. in front of a grey backdrop, moody lighting is being adjusted and bob is handed a bottle of suntory. small documentary crew moves in on bob with a video camera the camera man is tilting the camera at his face in arty dutch camera moves. the agency people crowd around. the photographer is excited and urges bob to do dumb poses, he won't do.}
