<A>__{in the procedure room, novak lies in a hastily rigged third apparatus suspension device. miriam connects him to the iv cylinder and tubes.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{i have done this, you know. been inside.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{miriam nods, knowing he won't accept an opposing argument.}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(instructs him)}
<D>__{deep breaths.}
<A>__{in the observation room, henry adjusts monitors showing novak's vital signs.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{pulse is rapid, pressure's a little high...}
<A>__{in the procedure room, miriam asks:}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{nervous?}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<A>__{she loads a microchip sensor into a high pressure injection gun and implants it in novak's hand. he winces from the brief pain as she loads the chemical cartridges.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{i have to ask you some things... are you taking any prescription drugs?}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{prevacid. for my stomach.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{any psychiatric medication?}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{what about narcotics?}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{i know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{i am. i'm a pretty boring guy.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{i doubt that.}
<A>__{henry checks the "maps," catherine's vitals and reports.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{we should hurry.}
<A>__{miriam walks novak through what's about to happen.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{the first five minutes will be disorienting. give yourself time. let the drugs do the work. if you can see, smell, feel, hear, taste things you're on the right track. once you've acclimated, try to get a feeling for catherine. instinct plays a huge role in this. trust it.}
<A>__{she gives him a supportive touch on the shoulder, exits and shuts the door. in the observation room, miriam continues via intercom.}
<C>__{miriam }
<D>__{you can control how you see yourself clothes, shoes, that kind of thing but the rest of it is up to him. use only what he provides. don't try to change anything. or introduce something of your own. it'll only upset him.}
<A>__{in the procedure room, novak flexes his fingers and sees the little bump beneath his flesh.}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{agent novak? press the sensor.}
<A>__{novak does and the red light comes on. as novak is lifted, he looks at catherine, then stargher. valentine yips and settles beneath novak. the suspension device clicks into place and the mask descends.}
<C>__{miriam }
<D>__{no matter what happens, peter, remember one thing: it's not real.}
<A>__{novak's eyes fix on the clear liquid contained in the iv like cylinder. a liquid cloud of his blood grows within. preparing the mixture for injection. the viscosity of the fluid starts to thicken and the camera moves into the mixture. as blood and chemical swirls take shape, we move fast. deeper into the fluid at a molecular level. we feel like we're soaring over some kind of liquid landscape. novak hyperventilates. he's having difficulty making the 98 transition. flying faster, faster, faster. through an entire universe. novak is in the procedure room. alone. his face contorted as if feeling the effects of tremendous g force.}
