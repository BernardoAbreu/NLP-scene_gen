<A>__{a door flies open. jesse, eyes darting, pushes long hair in. bandaged hand clamped to the collar. shotgun at the neck. they move down a dark hallway. speed metal throbs, growing louder... long hair, gash gushing, leg crunches with each step... they turn another hallway... light spills from under a door, shadows behind it... jesse edges long hair forward, reaches the doorway, creeps through...}
<L>__{interior bedroom}
<A>__{the door swings wide on the room, revealing: buzz, on the bed, furiously fucking a dark haired hooker, over a bureau. as long hair rounds the corner... buzz looks up, sees jesse. dives for a gun. chrome flashes. everything explodes at once. the wall detonates and buzz goes down. shocked. choking. blood juts from his side. he tries to get up. can't. the hooker screams and cowers terrified in the corner. jesse pumps, aims through the haze and fires again. stereo explodes. music cuts out, plunging us into silence. jesse tosses clothes to the hooker.}
