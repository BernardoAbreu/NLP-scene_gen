<L>__{interior ike's hotel room later that morning}
<A>__{ike is still in bed. he slowly blinks awake, stretches, and is about to throw off the covers when maggie's voice breaks the silence.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{freeze. hold on to those covers i didn't come here to see ike junior. maggie smiles cheerfully at ike from the foot of the bed. he narrows his eyes at her.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{i take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<A>__{how do i do it? i'm not that beautiful. ike notices maggie is holding two coffees.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{coffee. now. maggie hands it to him.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{you're welcome. your notes made interesting bedtime reading if you like trashy fiction. your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. you must be very proud.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{i'm not a boastful man. what's your point? ike puts a shirt on as maggie speaks.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{my point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong. that won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either. so, i'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{really. maggie turns away from him as he dresses.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i've decided to cooperate and let you interview me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<A>__{for a thousand bucks. ike clears his throat as he stands putting his pants on.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{i want a big wedding and a killer dress and for a grand i will answer all your questions and let you follow me around. ike takes his coffee with him as he picks up his glasses, puts them on and crosses to the window.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{my magazine doesn't pay because for stories. it's not what you call ethical.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical? actually, i meant you. you probably got severance or expenses or both. i will take your check. no credit cards.}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(to maggie)}
<A>__{you've seen the post its. i've already got more juicy material than i need. why should i pay you dollar one?}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{because i think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing. ike knows she's right.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{too much.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{seven fifty.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{five hundred.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{six fifty.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{done. scowling, he writes out the check and hands it to her. maggie looks at it and smile sweetly.}
