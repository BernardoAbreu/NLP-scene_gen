<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{mrs. alvarado, a middle aged californian ex hippie type reclines with her feet on her desk, munching on celery sticks and sunflower seed paste. her small desk radio plays alternative rock. sun beams into the empty classroom and alike squints as she yanks the headphones out of her ears and pulls up a chair next to her desk.}

<A>__{mrs. alvarado flips to the back of the book and her mouth moves silently as she reads.}
