<L>__{26 years old (referred to as young elizabeth in this}
<A>__{script). we hear the sound of other dialogue, but from the same play. we are:}
<L>__{interior hedingham castle great hall night}
<A>__{thirty eight years earlier. and young elizabeth watches an earlier, slightly less sophisticated staging of "a midsummer night's dream" (the costumes and sets are a bit more thrown together). all the actors are children from 7 12 years old or so.}
<B>__{from backstage}
<A>__{a boy watches in the exact same position as we just saw oxford. this is boy oxford now only 10 years old. but he is made up and wears a winged costume for the character of "puck".}
<P>__{"oberon" (o.s.)}
<D>__{...and the owner of it blest ever shall in safety rest. trip away; make no stay; meet me all by break of day.}
<A>__{and the characters of "oberon" and "titania" exit. boy oxford hurries }
<B>__{on stage}
<D>__{"puck" if we shadows have offended, think but this, and all is mended, that you have but slumber'd here while these visions did appear...}
<A>__{next to young elizabeth, john de vere, oxford's father, also watches, his face beaming with pride.}
<P>__{"puck" (cont'd)}
<D>__{...and this weak and idle theme, no more yielding but a dream, gentles, do not reprehend; if you pardon, we will mend.}
<B>__{a stern looking man}
<A>__{is watching a few seats away from young elizabeth. he is william cecil (40's, robert's father). he is a puritan, dressed all in black (with a white lace collar), and has a long beard. he is frowning, loathing the play.}
<B>__{on stage}
<P>__{"puck" (cont'd)}
<D>__{so, good night unto you all. give me your hands, if we be friends, and robin shall restore amends.}
<A>__{the play now over, young elizabeth applauds with delight, as do the small group of courtiers all around her.}
<C>__{young elizabeth}
<D>__{lovely. lovely!}
