<L>__{exterior a snowy street in vienna dusk 1790's}
<A>__{as the tutti of the d minor concerto continues, we see salieri, dressed in this menacing costume, dark against the snow, stalking through a street which is otherwise lively with people going to various festivities. some of them wear frivolous carnival clothes.}
<L>__{interior mozart's living room dusk 1790's}
<A>__{mozart sits writing at a table. he appears now to be really quite sick. his face expresses pain from his stomach cramps. there is a gentle knock at the door. he rises, goes to he door and opens it. immediately there is a shock cut: the dark, frowning mask stares at him and at us. the violent d minor chord which opens don giovanni is heard. salieri in costume stands in the doorway.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{herr mozart?}
<A>__{the second chord sounds and fades. mozart stares in panic.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{i have come to commission work from you.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{what work?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{a mass for the dead.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{what dead? who is dead?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{a man who deserved a requiem mass and never got one.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{i am only a messenger. do you accept? you will be paid well.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{how much?}
<A>__{salieri extends his hand. in it is a bag of money.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{fifty ducats. another fifty when i have the mass. do you accept?}
<A>__{almost against his will, mozart takes the money.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{how long will you give me?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{work fast. and be sure to tell no one what you do. you will see me again soon.}
<A>__{he turns away. mozart closes the front door. instantly we hear the opening of the requiem mass (also in d minor). mozart turns and looks up at the portrait of his father on the wall. the portrait stares back. constanze opens the door from the bedroom. she sees him staring up.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{wolfi? wolfi!}
<A>__{he looks at her with startled eyes. the music breaks off.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{who was that?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{no one.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{i heard voices.}
<A>__{he gives a strange little giggle.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<A>__{she sees the bag of money.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{what's that? oh!}
<P>__{(pouncing on it)}
<D>__{who gave you this? how much is it? wolfi, who gave you this?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{i'm not telling you.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{you'd think i was mad.}
<A>__{he stares at her. she stares at him.}
