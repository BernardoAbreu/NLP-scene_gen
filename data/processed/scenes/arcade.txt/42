<L>__{interior laurie's house, living room day}
<A>__{alex and nick enter and immediately sense that something is wrong. the light from the t.v. screen continues to flicker and a low pitched electric hum permeates the air...the sound a live wire might make. and the hum seems to be mobile too, coursing through the walls...up, down, and around alex and nick. nick's eyes try to track the hum as it races overhead.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(freaked)}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{and as nick speaks, his breath escapes his mouth in a frosty plume of mist. it's cold in here too. laurie, meanwhile, has failed to notice alex and nick's arrival. alex and nick step further in, to get a view of the t.v.}
<B>__{static}
<A>__{fills the screen. static and strange whisper voices. it's all indistinct.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(shaking laurie)}
<D>__{laurie...wake up...}
<A>__{laurie's face is a mess. tears are running down, but she's grinning all the same. it's frightening.}
<C>__{laurie}
<P>__{(voice distant)}
<D>__{i am awake.}
<P>__{(grins wider)}
<D>__{don't you see them?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{see what?}
<A>__{laurie points to the t.v. screen.}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{angels. there are angels inside.}
<A>__{but we see only static.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{we have to turn it off, laurie. i'm turning it off...}
<A>__{as alex reaches for the "off" knob, a face coalesces out of the static. it's greg again.}
<C>__{greg}
<P>__{(static laced)}
<D>__{alex. don't leave me here.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{jesus christ!}
<A>__{and on the screen, greg's face metamorphosizes into arcade's!}
<C>__{arcade}
<P>__{(mocking greg, electronic)}
<D>__{"don't leave me here".}
<A>__{and even as arcade speaks, the voice seems to come from all around them, from the humming coursing through the walls. nick backs away from the screen, petrified.}
<C>__{arcade}
<P>__{(seductive)}
<D>__{hi, nick. ready to kiss reality goodbye?}
<A>__{the humming around them has increased. laurie begins to shake.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{change the channel!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{alex snatches up the remote control and stabs the buttons.}
<B>__{on screen}
<A>__{every single channel portrays the fractals. recombining and growing. the screen flickers and arcade's face appear again, reestablishing control.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(angry, scared)}
<D>__{who are you?!}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{god.}
<A>__{the word reverberates through the room and humming has become a roar around them. an electrical storm.}
<B>__{outlets}
<A>__{around the room are crackling with energy, spitting out sparks.}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{come inside. i only want to play.}
<A>__{alex drops the remote, stunned.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{oh god... he's in the cable system! he's out of the game!}
<A>__{nick's eyes find the cable wire extending from the wall and into the t.v. sure enough, sparks are crackling down that wire and into the wall. arcade laughs and it's the most awful sound we've ever heard.}
<B>__{laurie}
<A>__{is convulsing now, and tiny sparks are racing around her eyes. alex sees her and screams, clutching her hands to her ears in an attempt to block out the deafening roar.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{moves without thinking, picking up a nearby chair and slamming it into the television. it explodes glass, sparks, and smoke. the humming stops altogether, quiet now. and then, from everywhere at once...}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{see you on the other side.}
<A>__{with a final roar, the energy behind the walls whips around and around, then rushes away. outside, nick catches a quick glimpse of sparks racing across the telephone wires suspended above the back yard. total silence for a moment. alex and nick are too stunned to speak. then alex looks at laurie.}
<B>__{laurie}
<A>__{lies on the ground, unconscious. glass scattered all around her.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{laurie...}
<A>__{alex drops to her side, trying to find a pulse...anything.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{is she breathing?}
<A>__{alex nods.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{then leave her.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{we can't...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{we'll call 911. look around alex. we broke in, smashed the t.v., no one's going to believe what happened here!}
<A>__{alex glances around. the room is a mess. all the outlet are singed. and now she notices that everything electronic...t.v., clock, thermostat...all of them have exploded open.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i believe you now. i don't know what the fuck just happened, but it did. now let's get the hell out of here.}
<A>__{alex slowly rises, reluctant to leave laurie's side.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{where do we go?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{my house. i want to try something.}
