<L>__{interior day. lowood the hall later.}
<A>__{the hall is empty but for the small figure of jane, high on her stool, feeling her isolation like pain. across the room is the slightly bigger figure of helen, hunched, the back of her dress still open, the skin on her neck raw. the sun is setting. at last jane starts to sob.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{come now, don't cry.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you're not allowed to speak to me. i must be shunned.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{mr brocklehurst is not a god. he's not liked or admired here }
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{he said i was a liar.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{jane }
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i am not a liar!}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{if your own conscience approves you, then so will i.}
<A>__{jane is deeply gratified.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{how do you bear it?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{bear what?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{being struck.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i'm a trial to miss scatcherd. she hits me to improve me.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{if she hit me i would get that birch from her hand and break it under her nose.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you'd just be punished even more. it's part of life here.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i have always been excluded and alone and hated. miss abbott used to call me an ugly little toad.}
<A>__{helen approaches jane.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you're not ugly. do you know what is inside you?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{the spark of your spirit, the principle of light and thought, pure and bright, as perfect as anything created.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{your soul. your soul is beautiful, your soul has value more value than anything on earth.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{is that true?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{yes. god sees your beauty. even as you stand on that stool, there is an invisible world around you, a kingdom of spirits. it is everywhere. angels see your pain. angels know your innocence.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{angels?}
<A>__{helen smiles a wide smile.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{do you not believe in angels?}
<A>__{they hear the door. helen runs back to her place; cowers. miss temple appears in a shaft of light at the door.}
<C>__{miss temple}
<D>__{come here, girls.}
<A>__{the girls approach, dreading more punishment.}
<C>__{miss temple }
<D>__{i shall investigate mr brocklehurst's claims against you, jane. and unless they are proved, you will be exonerated.}
<A>__{miss temple looks over her shoulder.}
<C>__{miss temple }
<D>__{also, i understand you girls have had no food today.}
<A>__{she quickly presses a slice of hard cake into each girl's hand and walks away. jane and helen look at one another, deeply moved by her kindness.}
