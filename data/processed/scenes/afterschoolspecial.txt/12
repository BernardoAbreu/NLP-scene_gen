<C>__{deacon }
<D>__{in the normal course of things, matt probably wouldn't even have been our friend, but fred likes having someone to boss around, and i think matt's actually pretty cool once you get to know him.}
<A>__{just then, the burly girls' swim team coach comes out of the girls' locker room. she walks by matt without noticing, and the door to the locker room closes slowly. matt's attention is drawn to it. the door stops with a creak, a sliver of daylight still visible. matt shakes his head and starts to walk away towards the boys' locker room. then, he stops. he's torn. he's still too immature to really be interested, but he thinks he should be. he looks around quickly, then slowly approaches the door. he turns his head sideways, and places it up against the crack. matt's pov the proverbial jackpot. teenage girls changing. bras. panties. towels...}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{matt's eyes widen. and then, they close tight. he quickly scurries away.}
<P>__{deacon (cont'd; v.o.)}
