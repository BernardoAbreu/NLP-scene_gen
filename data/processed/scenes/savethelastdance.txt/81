<L>__{interior patterson high girls' lavatory morning}
<A>__{dripping, out of order faucets, graffiti laced stalls, litter strewn floors are underscored by the spooky flicker of fluorescent lights. sara walks in. the bathroom appears to be empty. she's about to enter a stall when she hears the murmur of a voice. a guy's voice. then a girl's whimper. she eases forward a bit.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{i don't get paid 'til next week.}
<C>__{male }
<D>__{boo the fuck hoo. you can't put my bizness up your nose on no layaway plan. c'mon now. you know what you gotta do.}
<A>__{sara ventures carefully forward to the edge of the stall's open door. she cranes her neck trying to see without being sen. her pov stall a girl is seated on the toilet. a man straddles her, his crotch in her face. the girl sees sara. something in her face gives this away. the "man" glances out past his shoulder. he looks right down our throat straight into sara's eyes. malakai.}
<B>__{on sara}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{malakai backs up. the girl jumps up, runs out the lavatory. malakai zips up his pants. sara's frozen, staring at him.}
<C>__{malakai}
<D>__{you didn't see nothin', you don't say nothin'. not unless you want a taste for yourself. and that can be arranged.}
<A>__{he leaves. sara waits a moment. exits.}
<B>__{hallway}
<A>__{she sees mr. hill, starts to move for him. someone grabs her arm from behind. she turns, startled, a little afraid. it's the girl from the stall. she looks sara in the eye. shakes her head. don't. mr. hill walks by them unbeckoned.}
