<L>__{interior chet's apartment day}
<A>__{a hand grabs a beer from the fridge.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{you're not trying to draw a psycho pension...you really are crazy!}
<A>__{will heads into the living room with the beer. the voice belongs to danny glover. the guys are watching lethal weapon. murtaugh (danny glover) has just stopped riggs (mel gibson) from killing himself. riggs looks at him, crazily, before }
<C>__{riggs}
<P>__{(on tv)}
<D>__{i'm hungry. i'm gonna get something to eat.}
<A>__{chet looks over at will. he is drunk, and in a dark mood.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{maybe you should pace yourself. it's noon on a saturday.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{fridge is full, man. we're all good.}
<A>__{will drains half his beer.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{let me ask you a question. you remember tom small?}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{yeah, he used to kick our asses.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{turns out he was probably jerking off to it afterwards. he's gay.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{i hope he chokes on a dick. i never liked him.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{your sister did. she let him finger blast her. big time.}
<A>__{chet pauses the movie.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{what the fuck are you talking about? i don't want that shit in my head.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{sorry. kate told me about it last night. i thought you should know.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{you two were swapping stories about getting fingered? that's pretty cute.}
<A>__{chet chuckles. will ignores him, sips his beer.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{the point i'm trying to make is this: tom small was an asshole. he was totally wrong for your sister. just like every other guy she's ever dated. right through to that mark dude she's gonna get back together with. un be fuck me lievable...}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{whatever. why the fuck are we talking about who my sister goes out with?}
<A>__{at a loss, will shrugs. chet turns back to the tv, presses play. lethal weapon resumes. something blows up. chet pauses the movie and stares at will for a beat.}
<C>__{chet}
<A>__{you sneaky son of a bitch...you want to fuck my sister, don't you?}
<C>__{will}
<A>__{chet, i really don't...}
<C>__{chet}
<A>__{my twin sister!? which is basically like fucking me!}
<C>__{will}
<A>__{hey, if you guys had that twin esp shit this would be a completely different situation. there'd be logistical problems.}
<C>__{chet}
<A>__{we look exactly alike!}
<C>__{will}
<A>__{you look like a lot of people. you're a normal looking dude.}
<C>__{chet}
<A>__{this is so fucked up i can't even begin to process it. how long has this been going on?}
<C>__{will}
<A>__{if i had to put my finger on it...middle school ish.}
<C>__{chet}
<A>__{so all those sleepovers, they were just some kind of opportunity for you to peek in kate's bedroom?}
<C>__{will}
<A>__{it might have happened a few times. most of them were accidental.}
<C>__{chet}
<A>__{you're a peeping tom. you realize that, don't you? you're a sexual fucking deviant.}
<C>__{will}
<A>__{fuck you. i'm as normal as they come. your sister is attractive. she excites me, in a sexual way. fucking sue me. can't we just be adults about it?}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{you? an adult? sort of stretching the term.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{hey, let's not say shit we can't take back.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{take back? will, you got kicked out of junior college for punching a professor that made fun of some poem you wrote.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that poem was about your sister!}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{that is, literally, the saddest thing i have ever heard. like retards playing freeze tag sad. no wonder you deliver pizzas for a living.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{fuck you! maybe i was just hanging out with you for your sister. you were always a whiny little bitch. and you stuttered. all the kids used to call you "chutter."}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{whatever. i only started hanging out with you because you had a nintendo.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{did you see my nintendo naked? because i saw your sister changing into her swimsuit at your thirteenth birthday pool party. and it was the highlight of the whole shitty event.}
<A>__{chet bites his lip.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{okay. you wanna do this?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i think we already are.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{well, you know who i saw naked? jenny rifkin. while i was nailing her. the week after she dumped you.}
<C>__{chet }
<D>__{why do you think every time you wanna bet on whose cock's bigger i'm always willing to go in? 'cause i know mine's bigger. 'cause she told me!}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{wow...wow. you pulled a judas on jenny fucking rifkin. that is messed up. almost as messed up as how i sold your cal ripken signed ball for 200 bucks.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{my grandpa left me that ball in his will! you helped me look for it for a month!}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{now you know why we never found it.}

<C>__{chet}
<D>__{not quite yet. there's actually a mystery i wanna solve for you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i was the one who told john tanner about how your mom fucked that lifeguard. and i always felt awful about it, because even though he swore secrecy, he told everyone else in town. and then your parents wound up getting divorced. but now...i don't give a shit.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what!? you ruined...my fucking life!}
<A>__{will takes a swing at chet. he dodges it and puts will in some sort of choke hold.}
<C>__{chet}

<D>__{i'm gonna break this hold and then kick your skinny ass!}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{try it!}
<A>__{will flexes and tries to break the choke hold...no luck. he wrenches his back away from chet and screams }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what the fuck is that!?}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{my knuckle in your spine! no holds barred you backstabbing fuck!}

<A>__{chet lets will go. he drops to the floor, panting.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{let me tell you something. and it's the truest thing you'll ever hear, from the person who knows you best in the world...you're not good enough for my sister. and you never will be. you're the lowest common denominator, will. you're the square root of fucking zero.}
<A>__{will gets to his feet.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{fuck you...chutter!}
<P>__{(grabs dick)}
