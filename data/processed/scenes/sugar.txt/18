<L>__{exterior san pedro town morning 20}
<A>__{various sunday morning images establishing miguel's hometown: a dewey mist covers an empty baseball field, surrounded by acres of tall sugarcane. women hang laundry on the line to dry. a rooster walks alone through a graveyard. people spill out of church into the road. middle aged men drink beer in the dugout during a softball game.}
<L>__{exterior empty lot field day}
<A>__{a makeshift diamond is overrun with weeds, ditches, stones, and trash for bases. donkeys graze in the outfield, unphased by the little kids (10 14 years old) playing around them. a young pitcher fires in a fastball that beans the young hitter in the back. in the bleachers, two middle aged men drink beer and occasionally heckle the kids.}
<D>__{heckler #1 you're supposed to aim for the head!}
<A>__{nearby, miguel sits beside his old coach, frank (early 40s), watching the kids play. one of the local shoe shine boys cleans miguel's shoes with an old toothbrush as frank cracks open a beer. frank points out one of the kids on the field.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i like this one. good bat speed. only twelve years old, out here four, five hours everyday. his mom tells me he's missing school. i say, yeah, but... have you seen his swing?}
<A>__{they laugh.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i'm showing his older brother to the yankees on monday.}
<A>__{miguel nods, a hint of disappointment in his eyes.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(seeing this)}
<D>__{they don't know what they missed with you. it's cool though. they'll be knocking on your door, offering millions when you turn into a superstar. you'll see...}
<A>__{miguel nods, appreciating the vote of confidence.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{have you been to new york?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{nothing like playing for a crowd of new yorkers. they're even louder than dominicans.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{what's the city like?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's great. but you need to get to kansas city before you start thinking about new york. know what i mean?}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{you hear anything about spring training yet?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yep.}
<A>__{frank sips his beer.}

<D>__{miguel, luis! dinner is ready!}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{you'd tell me if you knew.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{maybe.}
<A>__{miguel shakes his head, gets up.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{wanna join us for dinner?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{not tonight. but give your mom a kiss for me, okay?}
<A>__{miguel gives a coin to the boy who's been cleaning his shoes before heading off with his little brother. frank sips his beer, calls out to the field }
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{c'mon, nelson! fire it in, baby!}
