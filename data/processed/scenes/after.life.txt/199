<L>__{interior paul's car moments later}
<A>__{through the windshield we see paul approach the car. he peers in nervously. then cautiously gets in. as he switches the interior light off, the camera moves slowly around him revealing... ... anna sitting in the passenger seat.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{are we going home?}
<A>__{paul turns sharply. stunned. anna moves towards him.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{or do you want to make love here?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{where did you go?}
<A>__{anna puts her fingers on paul's lips. clearly turned on. we hear the sound of something being unzipped.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{i've been waiting for you. i missed you so much.}
<A>__{a line of blood trickles from his nose. he touches his lips. looks blankly at the blood on his fingertips. a drop of blood falls on paul's white shirt. it unfurls like a flower. spreading out over the material.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i love you. i always did.}
<A>__{anna hungrily kisses him. he responds passionately. suddenly we hear a sharp metallic sound.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{what was that?}
<A>__{anna responds as if it was nothing strange.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's only the scissors...}
<A>__{we see the growing anxiety in paul's eyes. anna's just interested in his lips.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{scissors? what scissors?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{scissors. for your clothes. eliot just put them on the table.}
<A>__{paul pulls back. terrified.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you're safe now. we're finally together.}
<A>__{a strong bright light sweeps across paul's face. like the headlights of the car on the blind curve earlier.}
