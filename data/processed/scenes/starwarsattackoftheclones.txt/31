<L>__{exterior space, starship freighter}
<A>__{the massive, slow moving freighter suddenly zooms away into lightspeed.}
<L>__{interior starfreighter, storage hold day}
<A>__{the great, gloomy hold is crowded with emigrants and their belongings. to one side artoo is coming to the head of a food line, where servers are ladling out bowls of mush. artoo holds two bowls.}
<C>__{server}
<D>__{keep moving! keep moving!}
<A>__{artoo slips tube into a tub of mush and sucks up a large quantity. with one of his little claw arms, he grabs several chunks of something that looks like brown bread. a server sees him.}
<C>__{food server}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hey! no droids!}
<A>__{artoo takes one last big suck and heads away from the food line. the server shouts after him angrily. the little droid moves past groups of eating or sleeping emigrants and comes to where anakin is sound asleep. the young jedi seems to be having a nightmare. he is very restless.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{no, no, mom, no...}
<A>__{he is sweating. padme leans over to wipe some of the sweat from his forehead. he wakes up with a start, then realises where he is. padme simply looks at him. he stares back, somewhat confused. artoo fills up two bowls with mush.}
<C>__{anakin}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{you seemed to be having a nightmare.}
<A>__{anakin looks at padme a little more closely, trying to see if he has revealed any of his secrets. she hands him a bowl of mush and bread.}
<C>__{padme}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{are you hungry?}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{we went into lightspeed a while ago.}
<A>__{anakin looks into padme's eyes.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i look forward to seeing naboo again. i've thought about it every day since i left. it's by far the most beautiful place i've ever seen...}
<A>__{padme is a little unnerved by his intense stare.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{you were just a little boy then. it may not be as you remember it; time changes your perception.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{it must be difficult having sworn your life to the jedi... not being able to visit the places you like... or do the things you like...}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{or be with the people i love.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{are you allowed to love? i thought that was forbidden for a jedi.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{attachment is forbidden. possession is forbidden. compassion, which i would define as unconditional love, is central to a jedi's life, so you might say we're encouraged to love.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{you have changed so much}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{you haven't changed a bit. you're exactly the way i remember you in my dreams. i doubt if naboo has changed much either.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{it hasn't...}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i can't wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills. whenever i try to visualise the force, those hills are what i see.}
<A>__{anakin looks at padme when he says this.}
<C>__{anakin}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i love naboo.}
<A>__{there is an awkward moment.}
<C>__{padme}
<P>__{(changing the subject)}
<D>__{were you dreaming about you mother earlier, weren't you?}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{yes... i left tatooine so long ago, my memory of her is fading. i don't want to lose it. recently i've been seeing her in my dreams... vivid dreams... scary dreams. i worry about her.}
<A>__{padme gives anakin a sympathetic look.}
