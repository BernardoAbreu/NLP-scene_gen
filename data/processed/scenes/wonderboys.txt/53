<D>__{that's weird.}
<C>__{officer pupcik}

<C>__{officer pupcik}
<D>__{no, the dog.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{just kidding.}

<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{it's okay. ..i'm here when you want me.}
<A>__{grady stands frozen as hannah smiles sleepily, pushes through the swinging door into the kitchen. a thumping is heard as james, tangled in the sleeping bag, hitches down the last few steps of the stairway. he watches pete pupcik drive away in his big police car.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{what do we do now?}
<A>__{#####before grady can reply, .the telephone sitting on the table next to him #####rings.}

<C>__{grady}
<D>__{could you hold on a minute, honey?}
<A>__{with a look of wonderment, grady watches his hand ever so gently ...hang up the phone.}
<C>__{grady}
