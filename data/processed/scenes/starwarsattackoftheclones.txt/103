<A>__{obi wan climbs a steep, narrow trail. suddenly, a cry is heard close by. obi wan stumbles slightly. his foot slips on the edge, sending a stream of peblles skittering into the darkness. obi wan listens. silence. he draws his lightsaber but does not ignite it. he sets off again and works his way around a narrow corner, to confront a crouching massiff (a dog sized lizard) with slavering fangs! the beast leaps at him, and obi wan ignites his lightsaber as the massiff knocks him on his back. its jaws open wide. obi wan stabs the creature, throws it off of him, and jumps up. a second massiff jumps from behind. obi wan swings around and cuts it in half. the massiff flies over the cliff, howling. it plummets to its death hundreds of feet below.}
