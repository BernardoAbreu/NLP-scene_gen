<L>__{interior lange's office day}
<C>__{lange}
<D>__{mr. gooding? you still in there?}
<A>__{trevor blinks and looks around him. lange is sitting just where they were when he saw him last. only now there's a very wary look on his face. whoa.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{uhh. yes detective, sorry. just trying to recollect, you know?}
<A>__{lange nods.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{okay. from what i remember now, maybe my wife was thrown from the car when it hit the water. maybe she wasn't trapped inside.}
<A>__{lange checks the report again. he believes trevor...or does he?}
<C>__{lange's voice}
<D>__{that's a start. i will tell the people trawling the river maybe it makes a difference maybe not. thanks for your help trevor. if we have any more questions you'll get a call from myself or my partner detective givens.}
<A>__{lange stands up and backs up awkwardly to a file behind his desk. trevor stares at him suspiciously.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{you guys know something i don't?}
<C>__{lange}
<D>__{all things considered we probably know a lot less than you do. have a good afternoon, mr. gooding.}
<A>__{trevor exits, both men maintain eye contact as the door closes between him.}
