<A>__{at the tea shop, a group relive the day's events. the children sleep. aloka sits outside, worried about hasari. max comes out, meets aloka's eyes and looks away. she's heard the conversation. hasari, drunk, comes down the slope. face to face with max.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{they took away my rickshaw.}
<A>__{aloka's hand flies to her mouth. hasari peers at max with his drunken gaze. it's a terrible moment for max, but...}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{so what do you want me to do about it get it back for you?}
<A>__{max takes away a step. stops.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm going home. because this isn't my fight. i got one person to look after me.}
<A>__{hasari stares at max. on the roof, the children listen. at the tea shop, the late night talkers listen.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{all right, i'm running out, okay? because i'm a coward, this is me, this is what i do, i get in over my head, i let people down, i run.}
<C>__{hasari}
