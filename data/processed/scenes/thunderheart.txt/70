<A>__{he keeps knocking. nothing. he hurries back down the steps, starts around the back of the house and something attacks him, leaps at him from the dark, knocking him off his feet, into the grass. hits him again. but as quickly as he falls, he rolls, throwing up his hands and blocking a savage kick aimed for his face. he traps the boot, twists it and drops the attacker onto his back. in a matter of seconds, he is on top of the man, sticking his gun in his throat. he grabs a flashlight from his jacket and shines it in the man's face. crow horse. breathing like a wild animal.}
