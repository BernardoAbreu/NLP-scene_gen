<L>__{interior movie house. wide across audience at screen.}
<A>__{the opening musical sequence of "golddiggers" is on the screen. ginger rogers sings "we're in the money." among the audience we cannot make out our three people. it is a small audience and thinly dispersed. tight shot at audience. camera pans the audience while on the track we hear the music of the song. first of our group who becomes visible is c.w. he is staring at the screen and eating bites from a candy bar in each hand. camera pans further and we see that clyde is in the row behind c.w. and a few seats to one side. clyde is nervous and keeps watching the entrance doors. he is in a rage. he shifts in his seat.}
