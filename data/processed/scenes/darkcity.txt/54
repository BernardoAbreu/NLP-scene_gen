<L>__{interior hall way (doctor's residence)}
<A>__{schreber's office is an annex of his living quarters a maze like series of rooms and halls. white is led down a dark hall by schreber, clutching a candle.}

<A>__{they've stopped outside a flaking door.}
<L>__{interior kitchen}

<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{i don't blame you for getting angry. you are in a frustrating situation. you must be patient though. trust me completely. i'm here to help.}

<D>__{i have to talk to you.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{it can't wait?}
<A>__{she shakes her head, with a serious expression, then darts out again.}
<C>__{schreber }
<D>__{excuse me. ah, make yourself at home.}
<A>__{he leaves. alone, white looks around the bleak room. he takes off his coat and sits down again. he removes the fish. the eye opens. the creature looks up at him. it breaths painfully.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{still kicking, huh?}
<A>__{he puts it back in his pocket. the other fish is spattering oil everywhere. smoke starts to fill the room. white, steps over and looks at the frying pan. the fish is turning black. he turns the heat down. he notices a small hole in the wall. at eye height. he steps across, looks through. tight on white's eye through the hole.}
<B>__{his p.o.v.}
<A>__{a dark room. shadows on the wall. something wet, some kind of animal, moving in the darkness. he can hear breathing and whispering voices. white's eyes start to blur, he rubs them.}
<C>__{schreber o.s.}
<D>__{how are things in here?}
<A>__{white spins, like he's caught doing something wrong. the doctor walks across to the stove, prods the frying fish with a fork.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{ah, nearly done. so tell me about your dreams. i'm very interested.}
<A>__{white is having a hard time focusing.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{just the typical fabrications of a distorted mind. you know, chased by mysterious men in black, that kind of thing...}
<A>__{white's p.o.v. angle on schreber with his back turned, at the stove. the image is blurring.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{ah, our friends in black... they are not just a figment of your imagination you know, in fact none of what you are experiencing is anything but real.}
<A>__{smoke rises thickly around the doctor.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{i know everything about you. you have no choice but to trust me.}
<A>__{flames are shooting up around schreber from the frying pan. his arms catch fire, and he suddenly spins around clutching flaming daggers in both hands, his whole body engulfed in fire, his face charred, black flesh hanging off his skull.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{scarey, isn't it?}
<A>__{white startles awake. schreber stands at the stove looking at white. everything is normal.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{are you feeling alright?}
<A>__{white stands awkwardly, pulls his coat on.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{i have to go...}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{you can't go yet. we've got so much to talk about...}
<A>__{suddenly white feels feint leans against the wall to steady himself.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{you're tired. you need to lie down.}
<A>__{on white swaying.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{those pills...}
<B>__{his p.o.v.}
<A>__{the scene is distorted like looking through water. things start spinning.}
<C>__{schreber }
<D>__{yes. a little something to help you relax. harmless...}
<A>__{a tile floor rises rapidly towards camera.}
