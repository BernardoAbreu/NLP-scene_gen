<L>__{interior curtis' truck day}
<A>__{curtis slams the door to his truck, sealing him off from the torrential rainfall outside. he shakes water off, wipes his face. the windows are smeared by thick, dark rain. it's hard to see out. he looks over to hannah sitting in her car seat. it looks odd on the front bench of the truck. he signs to her.}
<C>__{curtis}
<P>__{(signing and speaking)}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{she nods. he cranks the truck and turns on the wipers. the liquid on the windshield streaks into long smudges. curtis leans forward to get a better view of the street. he checks his blind spot and pulls away. moving fast on a main road, stop lights blur into hazy red and green spheres. curtis checks the rearview, but the back window is covered by the rain. he tries rolling down his window, but water blows in. he rolls it back up and the smudging gets worse. the truck shimmies from left to right, pushed by the wind. a thunder strike rattles. suddenly,}
<B>__{the shape of a person standing in the road.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{curtis stomps on the brakes and turns the wheel. the truck hydroplanes. crash! curtis' head busts against the steering column. the front windshield cracks as the truck jerks to a stop. the hiss of a broken radiator. curtis winces from the blow to his head. hannah is crying. he reaches over to her.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{are you okay?}
<A>__{hannah physically looks all right, but she continues crying. curtis reaches out and places a hand on her head. he's dazed, mumbling.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{you're okay.}
<A>__{the truck is angled up slightly like the front end has inched up a pole. a cut on his forehead has begun to bleed. he sees movement. a person passes by the hazy side window. a shape moves past the driver's window. the truck shifts as weight is added to the bed. the sound of someone pulling things from the back of the truck. a moment. whack! curtis flinches as a 2x4 pounds the windshield. the truck jostles from the weight of someone jumping on the hood. bump. bump. the roof caves in with two footsteps. curtis looks around frantically. he reaches over to hannah and begins to unstrap her from the car seat. smash! a board breaks through the passenger window. a woman, pale and aggressive, stands in the rain storm staring through the broken glass. she reaches for the lock. curtis pulls hannah from the child seat and recoils against his door but is jolted as another board crashes through the driver's window. a hand yanks curtis by his collar. he's pulled against the door. a pasty forearm wraps around his neck, choking him. he strains against the arm. sucks air. needing to breath. the woman at the passenger door grabs for hannah. curtis kicks at her. a man's boot kicks out the back window. the man in the bed of the truck reaches for curtis' face. he flails and kicks, unable to break free from the forearm at his door. the woman gets hold of hannah. the child is yanked from curtis' arms. he screams.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{hannah! hannah!}
<A>__{hands claw at curtis' face. scratching. blood streaks. the woman has disappeared into the storm with hannah. curtis screams. fingers swoop into his open mouth, grabbing hold of his cheek. they pull the cheek back. tearing. he yells in pain.}
