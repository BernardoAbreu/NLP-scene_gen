<L>__{exterior the warehouse sunset}
<A>__{a desolate urban landscape sam and vincent walking away from the warehouse, which is housed in what looks to be the toughest neighborhood in the city, filled with cheap concrete public housing and industrial buildings. the setting sun throws a red glow on the street, giving the raw concrete buildings a blood colored tint, as sam and vincent approach a fiat, a car neither too old nor too new. before they can reach the car, the two men are intercepted by four toughs, young guys in their early twenties. the leader of the toughs apporaches vincent.}
<C>__{leader}
<P>__{(subtitled french)}
<D>__{who gave you permission to park here?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(to vincent)}
<D>__{what's he saying?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{pretty much what you'd expect.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(with a sigh)}
<D>__{that's what i thought.}
<C>__{leader}
<P>__{(in french)}
<D>__{there's a charge for parking on our block.}
<A>__{the other toughs add lib a few tough guy remarks (in french, of course).}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{he says this is their block.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{as in, they own it?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{something like that...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and i suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i didn't know that you spoke french.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i don't. but the language he's speaking is universal.}
<A>__{angle on the leader who's smirking at vincent and sam. sam's words make a great deal of sense: the leader is speaking the universal language of "give me some money or i will kick your ass."}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{i guess we oughta give them something...}
