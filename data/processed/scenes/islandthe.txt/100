<A>__{a mass of technology and furniture from recent and distant past. lincoln lowers ester onto a threadbare sofa. ozzie, excited to have visitors, bustles up with a water gallon, pouring a glass. lincoln takes it and tips it to ester's lips. she coughs it out at first. then takes the glass and starts drinking with vigor. ozzie sets down the water gallon in front of his visitors. then settles in an armchair and cracks open a beer. it lends the mood, albeit strained, of a social visit. lonely old ozzie wanting to make it so. despite which, both men have an eye on each other.}
