<L>__{exterior heart of gold. bridge. continuous}
<A>__{zaphod hits eject. the blue cube rises.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{that's it?}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{that's it.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{you're looking for the ultimate question?}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{yep.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{you.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{me.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{no, i tried that. "why?" "forty two." doesn't work.}
<P>__{(to trillian)}
<D>__{let's get her ready, babe.}
<A>__{he moves to a different rack of instruments, consults a check list, starts flipping some switches.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{i mean, why do you want to know the ultimate question?}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{oh. well partly the curiosity, partly a sense of adventure, but mostly i think it's for the fame and the money.}
<A>__{he continues preparing the ship. trillian consults the huge manual, turning dials, flipping switches...}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{but you're president of the galaxy, aren't you?}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{yes, arman.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{arthur.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{whatever. presidential fame is temporary, i find the question, that's permanent. it sticks. plus everyone thinks you're deep. win win.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{but you don't know the name of the computer that other computer was talking about.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{which is why i'm going there.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{there. to find deep thought. on magrathea.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{magrathea!? magrathea is a myth, a legend...}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{no, it isn't. it's real, cousin. and this is the only ship in the universe that can get you there.}
<C>__{ford}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{you mean to tell me you carved up your brain so you could become president so you would get invited to the launching ceremony of this ship...so you could steal it... so you could go to magrathea which, according to most sane people, doesn't even exist?}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{yep.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{beautiful.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{why this ship? what's so special about it?}
<A>__{zaphod thinks again hard.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{i don't seem to be letting myself in on any of my secrets.}
<C>__{trillian }
<D>__{because of this, obviously.}
<A>__{they turn to see trillian flipping open a glass lid revealing a big red button. ford reads the glowing letters above the button...}
<C>__{ford}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{infinite improbability drive? so they finally built one that works. and that's how we got picked up.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{exactly. and i'm guessing if we hit that button we go to magrathea.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you're guessing?}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{hey, anyone who's not up for that, there's the door. now who's in?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{for a trip to a place that doesn't exist? i'm in. my editor will think i'm crazy, but what the hell he already thinks i'm dead.}
<A>__{he takes out the guide. zaphod looks to trillian.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{definitely. i'm in.}
<A>__{they're all standing together. they turn to arthur. arthur looks to trillian. she stares back waiting.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{do i even have a choice?}
<A>__{zaphod smiles, all bright and cheery.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{arthur looks at the button.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what exactly does an infinite improbability drive do?}
<A>__{suddenly, zaphod's head 2 shoots up!}
<C>__{zaphod head 2}
<D>__{this!!}
<A>__{zaphod's third arm shoots out and smacks the button.}
