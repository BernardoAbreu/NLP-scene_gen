<L>__{interior condominium incinerator. night.}
<A>__{the naked jerome scrapes away at his skin with even greater ferocity than usual. after exiting the incinerator, he deposits all the incriminating trash he has collected during the day into the furnace and ignites the gas.}
<L>__{interior eugene's condominium. night.}
<A>__{from outside, a car horn sounds. jerome, in a formal suit and spectacles, abruptly enters the condominium. he goes to a closet and starts searching through eugene's clothes.}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{mind if i borrow a tie?}
<A>__{eugene is more interested in the car parked outside the condominium. irene sits in a convertible citroen ds, dressed in a classic but provocative black suit. unaware that she is being observed she touches up her lipstick in the rearview mirror.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{so it's not just the hoovers who've got you rattled.}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{you're the one who said not to change anything. she's my ear to the investigation.}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{is that all?}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{i've got enough on my mind without that.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{if you say so.}
<P>__{(referring to the ties in jerome's hand)}
<D>__{the stripe.}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(agreeing with the selection)}
<D>__{good choice.}
<A>__{jerome fumbles with the knot. from his chair, eugene knots jerome's tie for him. jerome is intrigued that for once eugene is abstaining he has not touched his drink.}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{not thirsty?}
<P>__{(referring to the fridge)}
<D>__{we've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{i don't feel too good. i think i'm still drunk from last night.}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{never stopped you before.}
<P>__{(regarding eugene's head)}
<D>__{and for god's sake stop plucking your hair. someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{if i were you i'd worry about myself.}
<P>__{(nodding to jerome's spectacles)}
<D>__{haven't you forgotten something?}
<A>__{jerome pockets the spectacles and enters the bathroom for his contact lenses. the horn sounds outside the window a second time and jerome hastily exits. we stay with eugene. irene catches a glimpse of him before he moves away from the window. jerome emerges from the building. as the couple drive away, eugene wheels himself to the full length mirror. he regards his own reflection for a moment and opens the mirror a disguised door opening into the adjacent apartment. a cloud of condensed water vapor billows out. german, the dna broker, emerges with an engineer. he sends the engineer on his way and joins eugene at his desk. eugene hands german a credit card that he wipes through his computer.}
<C>__{german}
<D>__{we still need to overhaul the back up generator.}
<P>__{(fixing eugene with a penetrating stare)}
<D>__{what's going on, eugene, i thought he was going away, not you you going on vacation?}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(looking away)}
<D>__{you got it, german.}
<C>__{german}
<P>__{(nodding thoughtfully)}
<D>__{you deserve it.}
