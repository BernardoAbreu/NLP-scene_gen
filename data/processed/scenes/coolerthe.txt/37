<L>__{interior casino midway night}
<A>__{bernie and natalie wander around the midway. a middle aged worker at the ring toss booth gets her attention.}
<C>__{ring toss worker}
<D>__{over here, young lady! c'mon, give it a try. eight for a dollar.}
<A>__{natalie drags bernie over. she pays her money and the worker hands her the rings. natalie throws, and misses all eight. the man pats her on the shoulder.}
<C>__{ring toss worker}
<D>__{sorry there, sweetheart. better luck next time. wanna try again?}
<A>__{natalie is about to take him up on it, when she catches bernie's eye. his look suggests she's being played for a sucker. she decides against it. they walk off down the midway. bernie chuckles to himself.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{nothing. you're just an easy mark, is all.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{an easy mark?}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{yeah. easy mark. you never heard that term?}
<A>__{natalie shakes her head.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{when we were kids, shelly and me, we used to work coney island during the summer. when a guy would walk up and seemed eager to open his wallet, we would always mark him with chalk. we'd pat him on the back or arm with the chalk. like, 'hey buddy, good job!'}
<P>__{(pats natalie)}
<D>__{meanwhile, he had no clue the other guys saw him coming a mile away. easy mark.}
<A>__{natalie looks down at her shoulder where the man patted her. she brushes it for effect. bernie smiles. they take a seat at the end of the midway. natalie locks onto a little toe headed boy being dragged around by his older brother and the brother's friend. the kid has a glazed look in his eyes. natalie fixates on the boy with a haunted expression. bernie picks up on it.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{you ok?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{you notice last night, that tattoo on my butt?}
<C>__{bernie}
<P>__{(are you kidding?!)}
<D>__{little joe.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{yeah, two twos. little joe.}
<A>__{natalie hides her face behind her soda cup. looks off in the distance.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i had a son. his name was joe. i was his mother for a year.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{you know, you don't have to tell me this.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i want to, bernie. better you know the worst of me up front. later, when i'm already invested in you, it'll be too hard to come clean. after i tell you this, you'll probably... i mean, i will understand.}
<A>__{she tears her eyes away from bernie. bernie can't believe what he's hearing. that she wants to be invested in him. what could be so bad?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i gave my son up for adoption. i just wanted my life back. i was seventeen going on eighteen and i was selfish. my family, they didn't want to have nothing to do with me after that. so i hitched a ride out here. figured i could make it as a showgirl. ten years later...}
<P>__{(shrugs; starts to break up)}
<D>__{i like to think that if it happened when i was older with some guy i cared about maybe things would have been different. i think about my little joe. and, i do know he's better off. i'm convinced of that.}
<A>__{she lowers her soda. turns to bernie. he studies her for a lengthy beat, stoic features. she wipes away her tears. oh well, that's that. bernie stands up. looks around... focuses on the arcade clock. it reads 1:40 a.m. he turns to her...}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{so, you wanna go try your hand at the dime pitch? it's early still.}
<A>__{off natalie's tear filled features. she breaks into a laugh cry...}
