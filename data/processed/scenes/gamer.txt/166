<L>__{interior angie's building, lobby continuous}
<A>__{kable grabs hackman with both hands, rips him out of the elevator and slams him into a wall. a brutal head butt to the face, smashing bone... another. hackman's face erupts with blood. hackman swings blind with the bowie knife, once, twice the blade misses kable, backpedaling, by fractions of inches; displacing some serious air... hackman lets it fly. the bowie whistles past kable's face and thunks into the wall behind him, four inches deep. hackman smears the blood from his eyes and brings up the shotgun, but kable is quick instead of trying to move away, he steps in, pushing the barrel straight down as hackman fires. the big hit puts a crater in the floor and takes out a set of hackman's toes. kable kicks the shotgun from hackman's hands and brings up his own weapon to close the deal... ... as the glass walls of the lobby explode. more slayers are moving in. kable releases a barrage of cover fire, grabs angie and breaks for the back exit.}
