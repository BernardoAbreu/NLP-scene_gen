<A>__{we are with a short order cook. he expertly flips a burger from a hotplate and adds it to a plate overflowing with bacon, sausage and fries. he slips this plate onto a tray on which there is a second plate containing two pieces of plain bread and some lettuce. he dings a bell and a waiter enters and picks up the tray. we move with the tray as he carries it from the kitchen and into the dining area. he stops at the bar to load three foaming glasses of beer and a glass of water onto the tray, and delivers it to phil and larry, who are sitting in a window booth. larry has his head resting on the table. he lifts it as soon as the food arrives.}
