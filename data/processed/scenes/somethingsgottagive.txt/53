<D>__{ look, i get that he has a right to get remarried, but he doesn't even know her and she's like my age. you know what that's like? it's like beyond creepy. and i know he's not replacing me so why does it feel like he is? this is crazy, right? crying like this...}
<P>__{( lights a cigarette)}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{honey, if he's replacing anyone, it's me. and all the statistics say divorced men almost always remarry. that's just the way they're built.}

<P>__{(slipping on her dress)}
<D>__{mom, you want to know the answer to the big mystery of my life? why i'm always with the wrong guy? this is why. because the wrong guy can't do this to you. you have some control with the wrong guy. this thing i'm feeling right now. this is my big fear...that some guy could get me unglued like this, like nothing's connected. and this is just my father! i'm just not strong enough to handle this kind of drama.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{the drama in life is what makes you strong.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{no, it's what makes you strong. you've never really understood this,but we're not all like you.}
