<L>__{interior mickey's apartment bedroom loft night}
<A>__{the dark bedroom is abruptly lit as mickey, lying in his bed, wakes up with a start and turns on his night table lamp.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{i'm dying! i'm dying! i know it! there's a spot on my lungs!}
<P>__{(sitting up, putting on his glasses)}
<D>__{all right now, take it easy, will you? it's not on your lungs. it's on your ear. no, it's the same thing, isn't it?}
<P>__{(pulling the sheets}
<D>__{off and sitting on}
<P>__{the edge of his bed)}
<D>__{oh, jeez, i can't sleep! oh, god, there's a tumor in my head the size of a basketball!}
<P>__{(putting on his slippers)}
<D>__{n now i keep thinking i can feel it every time i blink! oh, jesus! he he he wants me to do a brain scan to confirm what he already suspects.}
<A>__{mickey, still ruminating, stands up. fixing his pants, he walks out of his bedroom loft into a dark upper hallway.}
<C>__{mickey }
<P>__{(running his hand along a banister)}
<D>__{look...i will make a deal with god. let it just be my ear, okay? i will go deaf. i will go deaf and blind in one eye maybe. but i don't want a brain operation! once they go into my skull, i will i will wind up like the guy with the, with the wool cap who delivers for the florist!}
<A>__{he walks down a spiral staircase into the dark living room.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{oh, relax, will ya? your whole life you run to doctors. the news is always fine.}
<P>__{(pausing at the bottom of the stairs)}
<D>__{that's not true. what about years ago?}
<A>__{the film cuts to a flashback of mickey's past. dr. smith, sitting behind his desk, faces the camera. rows of periodicals line the wall behind him.}
<C>__{dr. smith}
<P>__{(gesturing with one hand)}
<D>__{i'm sorry to say, mr. sachs, that you cannot have children.}
<A>__{the camera moves to dr. smith's point of view: hannah and mickey, sitting on the opposite side of the desk. they look stunned.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(reacting, putting his hands across his chest)}
<D>__{gee.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(reacting)}
<D>__{is there no chance?}
<C>__{dr. smith}
<P>__{(getting up from his desk)}
<D>__{well, naturally, this doesn't mean that you can't have a normal sex life.}
<P>__{(walking over to the}
<D>__{opened office door}
<P>__{and closing it)}
<D>__{but mr. sachs's tests indicate that he is infertile. small sperm volume and infertile.}
<A>__{the camera moves back to the stunned mickey and hannah, following dr. smith with their eyes.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(gesturing, looking}
<D>__{up at an offscreen dr.}
<P>__{smith)}
<D>__{isn't there anything i can do? push ups or hormones?}
<C>__{dr. smith}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{i'm afraid not.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{well, i gotta get a second opinion.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(turning to mickey)}
<D>__{this is the second opinion.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{well, then a third opinion.}
<A>__{dr. smith walks back to his high backed leather chair behind the desk and sits down. as he talks, the camera moves closer and closer to his face.}
<C>__{dr. smith}
<D>__{i realize this is a blow. my experience is that many very fine marriages become unstable and are destroyed by an inability to deal with this sort of problem. i hope you won't make too much of it. one can adopt children, and there are various artificial methods of fertilization.}
