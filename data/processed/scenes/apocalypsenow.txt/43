<A>__{they wade through the water to the beach where they are met by a heavily armed group of men. overhead jets swoop by firing rockets, the noise drowning out willard's attempt at conversation with some of the men. we can't hear any of the talk, but we notice that the sergeant turns up to a particular huey, and points to it.}
<L>__{36 full shot helicopters}
<A>__{three hueys swoop in low they are heavily laden with machine guns rockets and loudspeakers. the two out side copters hover, while the center copter lands, raising a lot of dust. it cuts its rotors and the other copters pull up and off to the side. two armed soldiers jump from the doors and stand with guns ready. then a tall, strong looking man emerges. he wears a well cut and neatly stretched tiger suit. it is colonel william kilgore tough looking, well tanned, with a black mustache. he crouches over, holding his hat in the rotor wash. it is no ordinary hat but a l.a. dodgers baseball hat. he walks out, and then stards to his full immense height and with his hands on his hips he surveys the field of battle. his eyes are obscured by mirror fronted sunglasses.}
