<L>__{exterior housing tract night}
<A>__{the police car is parked in the middle of the dirt road. benny and the officers are intent on a light that reaches them only in strobes as it moves through the houses in the direction of the fire on the hill. the police searchlight swings onto the house.}
<C>__{officer}
<P>__{(over outside speakers)}
<D>__{this is the police. identify yourselves.}
<A>__{it is deathly silent. carrying a shotgun the officer motions benny and mike to fan out on either side of him and, guns drawn, they cut across the tract to where they last saw the bobbing light. the fog quickly isolates them, heightening their fear. each man becomes acutely aware of the loudness of his breathing and the crunch of his footsteps on the ground. they drift in and out of visual contact with each other. benny freezes as he hears a burst of the high pitched whistle sweep by on his left. he turns slowly to see, through the ribs of an unfinished house, a shaft of the white light pointing at a cement mixer.}
<C>__{benny}
<P>__{(to the officers, his voice cracking)}
<D>__{there's one over here...}
<A>__{the brilliant light swings toward him. benny, his hands trembling, raises the gun.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{stop!! police!!}
<A>__{the light fixes on benny and terrified he shakes off a couple shots. the light goes out immediately.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(in benny's direction)}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{i think i shot one.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{jesus, benny. what are you doing?}
