<A>__{bourne works to hotwire the car. a cri car gets to the roof. two agents come from the elevator lobby. the three car alarms distract them. they search for bourne, but can't find him at first... bourne gets the car engine on but, given the wonders of modern anti theft technology his steering wheel is still locked. a second cri car arrives. bourne slams the car into low gear and backs up at high speed. he smashes into the car across the aisle from him. with a sharp metallic snap the wheel in bourne's car is suddenly free, he jams the car into drive pulls out into lane and stops. three cri cars here now. two head straight for him. a third blocks the exit ramp. bourne checks the rearview and sees two more agents pour from the elevator lobby, one carrying the serious firepower of an m 4 (an m 16 variant whose bullets can penetrate metal and concrete). they move into position to get a bead on him. bourne assesses. but he doesn't move. the agents swarm toward him. what the hell is he doing? why is he waiting?}
