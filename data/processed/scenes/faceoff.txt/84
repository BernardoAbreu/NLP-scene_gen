<L>__{interior "clinic" night}
<A>__{archer is dumped on the floor. he sees he's lying in a puddle of something. he looks up and recoils. archer's pov dubov is strapped to a vertical gurney post procedure. his limbs are stiff, his eyes blank as a mako shark's. but his feet are bare bootless.}
<D>__{med tech where's the mop, he puked all over the place.}
<A>__{an assistant unstraps dubov and drops him on a gurney.}
<D>__{med tech}
<P>__{(mopping up)}
<D>__{ next time, bring them in before dinner...}
<A>__{archer cases the place: above is a catwalk... leading out.}

<A>__{walton muscles archer into the gurney. the med tech smirks.}
<D>__{med tech oh happy day castor troy.}
<A>__{the med tech wheels the ect head gear cart into place: twin needle like bolts ready to fit into archer's ears. a single blue static spark jumps from the bolts. walton roughly wedges archer's head into the head gear, shoving the chewed up bite strap into archer's mouth.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{bite hard, scumbag, 'cause you'll be gumming baby food from here on out. med tech get his boots, sergeant.}
<A>__{walton unlocks archer's first boot and pulls it off. as the med tech starts to fasten archer's arm walton unlocks and pulls off the second boot. archer's feet are free. crack! he yanks his foot up hard walton reels back, stunned. one arm still restrained, archer backrolls in the gurney and kicks the head gear cart away knocking it into the med tech who collapses onto it, hitting "test" zap! the head bolts fire, catching the med tech through the shoulder he drops to the floor, his synapses shot. seeing that archer is still restrained by the arm the assistant darts out of the room. as archer pulls free walton looms over him gun poised. then wham! dubov wallops walton using his boots as brass knuckles. the head guard collapses. dubov smiles dumbly at archer all trace of vendetta now obliterated. archer nods gratefully they're on the same team... at least for now. suddenly the alarm blares. archer sees guards charging the room. he tries closing the door but the guards arrive. dubov lumbers over and puts his massive weight into it and slams the door shut. o.s., guards pound at the now locked door. archer quickly frisks walton coming up with a cigarette lighter. he pockets it. scanning around archer leaps onto a mounted, hinged lamp. it swings against the wall. archer uses it to reach the catwalk above.}

<D>__{dubov come on!}
<A>__{dubov obeys and follows archer up onto the catwalk. a groggy walton muscles open the door from inside. guards pour in. walton grabs an auto rifle and opens}
