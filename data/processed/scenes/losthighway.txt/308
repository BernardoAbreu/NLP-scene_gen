<A>__{we see a street sign saying "deep dell place". pete walks up the street looking at numbers. he finds 2224 deep dell place andy's house. he stares at the house from the sidewalk. lights are on upstairs and down. the hot wind moves big shadows of trees over the front of the house. pete looks at his watch. it reads: 11:05 p.m. he walks down the driveway, crosses through some bushes and comes to a fence separating the front yard from the back. he stops and listens. he pulls himself up and over the fence, but crashes on something on the other side. he freezes listening. he hears the wind blowing through the trees, and distant music from inside a slow jazz piece. he hears echoing sounds of love making. he makes his way around back goes up the stairs and tries the back door. it opens.}
