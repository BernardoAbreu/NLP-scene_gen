<A>__{the alleyway and street. just regular traffic. suddenly lisa comes into the picture from the left. she is carrying a white envelope. she stops, waves her hands at jeff, smiles, and then hurries on. the lens slowly pans to the right and stops on miss torso's apartment. she is standing on a small stepladder, nailing curtains above her window. her legs are bare, though she wears high heel shoes. we do not see more than half way up her thighs. the lens takes this in for the briefest split second of hesitancy then moves on to await the arrival of lisa along thorwald's corridor. she does not appear yet. the lens moves back to get another glimpse of miss torso, who is now descending the ladder. she is wearing a leotard. over this, we hear stella's voice:}

<D>__{what are you going back for?}
<A>__{the lens quickly swings back to thorwald's corridor. lisa is seen turning the corner, and approaching thorwald's door on tiptoe.}
