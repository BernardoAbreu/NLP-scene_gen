<A>__{arthur at the head of a small force of knights, their armor shining beneath the moon, gallops through the land. where hooves thunder, the ground becomes alive with sprouts and tendrils, and bare trees start to bud, and grasses to blossom, the power of nature exploding into life.}
<L>__{interior convent dawn}
<A>__{an old nun approaches the doors, upon which someone is pounding loudly. she opens the peephole. it is arthur.}
<C>__{nun}
<D>__{go away. no man is allowed beyond these doors.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i am arthur.}
<A>__{the old nun is amazed and starts pushing open the many bolts, mumbling and agitated.}
