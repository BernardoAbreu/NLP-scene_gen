<L>__{36: exterior city dump. city of eureka. night.}
<A>__{gloom congeals around flashlights. a winter mist falling down. trimble and doberman watch as berlin goes at it with a shovel. a dozen graves already dug and he's halfway into another. des pite the cold he sweats in shirt sleeves. also breathless and rests to catch his wind. "don't you have to go to bed?" no he doesn't. he wants to see the victim. digging recommences with trimble supplying the light. berlin suddenly stops. "get that lamp down here." white lime. black fur. they've found the dog. berlin begins an examination holding a tiny flashlight in his teeth. eyes excitedly back to trimble and gesturing towards a bag. "that bag there. you find a knife and a paira long nosed pliers." trimble does it relishing the snap of a switch blade. berlin still busy with the light in his mouth. trimble pissed because he can't see what's happening. berlin removes a crump led bullet from the back of the labrador's skull. holds it up for scrutiny. small calibre. badly distorted. "looks like a 22?"}
