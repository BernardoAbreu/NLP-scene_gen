<D>__{why was the door chained up? why the bloody hell would they lock themselves in like that?}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{not sure, but tell you what: chrislams better not be diggin' another grave out there.}
<C>__{riddick }
<D>__{other buildings weren't secure...}

<C>__{shazza}
<D>__{so that's what come of me zeke. an' you saw it. you was right there.}
<A>__{riddick nods.}
<C>__{shazza }
