<L>__{interior arena night}
<A>__{it is the night of the bicentennial fight... the location is the philadelphia spectrum. the spectrum is filling to capacity... grandly dressed celebrities and wealthy fight fans lower themselves into their ringside seat. nearly everyone is holding a red, white, and blue sweater... the arena is decorated in tons of patriotic red, white and blue. high above the ring are huge posters of george washington abe lincoln dr. martin luther king, jr. ben franklin and apollo creed.}
