<L>__{interior pham van's store day}
<A>__{inside, the energetic vietnamese owner, pham van, presides over his all purpose establishment: part general store, part barber shop, part saloon. at the bar are burt gummer and his wife heather, two no nonsense survivalists who have settled in perfection to await the coming apocalypse a nice enough couple, but there's a hint of paranoia around the edges. burt is shoving a box of cartridges across to pham.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{no, pham, they're not hollow points. i ordered hollow points and that's what i want.}
<A>__{when val and earl enter, pham automatically pops the tops on two cold beers and has them in place before the cowboys reach the bar. everyone exchanged nods.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{hi, guys, what you been up to?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{ran into the new college student, rona.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{rhonda. rhonda lebeck. she's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the feds will be at our door. "sorry, time to move. eminent domain."}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{down, honey, down.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{yeah, burt. the way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive world war iii.}
<A>__{heather and pham laugh. burt smiles patiently. just then the compressor in pham's ice cream freezer comes on. it's a loud chug chug chug sound mixed with a high pitched squeal.}
<C>__{pham van}
<D>__{hey val, listen. bearing going out, you think?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{could be.}
<A>__{he starts toward the compressor, but earl heads him off.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{catch it later, pham. gotta get over to nestor's.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{right. we plan ahead. that way we don't do anything right now. earl explained it to me.}
<A>__{as they turn to go, val does a take, amazed, as he spots a decorative bleached out cattle skull displayed on the counter with a $29.95 price tag.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{hey, pham van, what the hell is this?}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{a beauty, isn't it? we bought three of them for the rec room.}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(whispers to pham van)}
<D>__{we sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!}
<C>__{pham van}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{and i appreciate it.}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(playfully)}
<D>__{you don't get it, pham. the idea was: we were ripping you off.}
<A>__{suddenly a car alarm blares from outside. burt's out the door in a flash. the others follow.}
