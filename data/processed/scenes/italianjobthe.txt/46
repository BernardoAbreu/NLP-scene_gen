<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hi, stella.}
<A>__{she steps inside.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{refresh my memory. after you came to see me and told me what happened to my father, i told you i never wanted to see you again, didn't i?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah. you did.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{so i'm a little confused.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i found him.}
<A>__{at first it seems that charlie's words have no effect on her, but then he notices that her hands are trembling.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i can tell you where he is.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{i don't want to know.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<A>__{she doesn't answer.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{he's in los angeles.}
<A>__{she doesn't respond. doesn't ask him to go on, doesn't ask him not to. so he goes on...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{the gold bricks he stole from us were minted in singapore and decorated with the face of a balinese girl. i've had my tentacles out and got a call from a friend of mine and your father's, philly steak.}
<A>__{stella remembers him.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{when i was little he would play poker at the house and drop quarters under the table for me to find.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{he got word from an l.a. connection named skinny pete that a gold dealer has been buying bricks with the balinese girl on them, three or four at a time.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{you ever heard the expression, cut to the chase?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i tracked steve down to an address in the hollywood hills. he's changed his last name to frezelli. and get this: he had a worthington 1000 installed in the house before he even moved in. we both know that you don't install a worthington 1000 unless you have something precious to guard.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{precious or not, i don't deal with ill gotten goods.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we boosted that gold from a terrorist group that was about to trade it for bio weapons. now that doesn't exactly make us robin hood, but maybe in our own little way we were doing a good deed. problem is, no one in my crew can handle that safe. and i need someone i can trust.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{and you think that's me? haven't you heard that i work for the other side?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what i heard is that you have your father's touch. and he was the only safecracker i knew who could open a worthington 1000.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{i'm not a safecracker. i'm a professional safe and vault technician.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you're john bridger's daughter. and this is our chance to set things right.}
<A>__{that sets her off.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{our chance? who do you think you are coming in here? stealing the gold isn't going to bring my father back to life.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no, it won't.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{then get out.}
