<C>__{welles}
<D>__{today a man from germany invaded greece. he has already swallowed poland and denmark and norway and belgium. he is bombing london as i speak. everywhere this man goes he crushes the life and the freedom of his subjects. he sews yellow stars onto their lapels. he takes their voices.}
<A>__{in this country we still have our voices. and we can sing with them. and we can argue with them. and we can be heard. because we are . . . for the moment . . . free. no one can tell us what to say or how to say it, can they? we have no brown shirt thugs here ruling our lives, do we? no one can take our voices, can they? because we are free. i am one voice and that is all. my picture is one voice. men are dying in europe now and americans soon will be so that we can surmount the tyrants and the dictators. will you send a message across this country that one man can take away our voices? so ... who is mr. hearst and who is mr. welles? mr. hearst built a palace of brick and mortar and starting little wars and corpses piled high. i built a palace of illusion. my castle xanadu is a matte painting and camera trick. it's nothing but . . . a dream. today you have a chance to let the dream triumph. for once. he gazes at them and then slowly walks out of the room}
