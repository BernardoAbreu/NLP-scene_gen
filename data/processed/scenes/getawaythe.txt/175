<C>__{carol}
<D>__{all right. you'll have to hold on a minute, my husband's in the shower...}
<A>__{doc breaks the lock and opens the door he quickly crosses the dark apartment, moves to the front door, slips out his automatic, then gingerly cracks the door. his eyes tighten in amazement as he sees: rudy standing slightly behind fran, his .44 held tightly up to the door jamb, ready for instantaneous use. rudy and fran are 15 feet down the hallway from doc's slightly opened door. they both have their backs turned to him in three quarter fashion. doc barefooted., bare chested; he decides on a course of action. the door swings quietly open. within the hallway, doc closes the distance between himself and rudy in two swift strides, rudy turns,, swinging his gun, too late, as doc's .45 crashes against his head. rudy drops. fran screams. rudy looks at doc, still smiling, eyes glazed. he falls abruptly. doc stands over the fallen body. fran continues to scream. doc finally turns away from rudy, looking now at the screaming woman. he flattens her with a left hook to the jaw. fran drops to the floor as if she had been shot. suddenly everything in the corridor is silent. rudy's head is bloodied. he lies without movement. doc now slams at the door of 318}

<D>__{who was it?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{just get your clothes on...}
<B>__{the fourth floor corridor}
<A>__{as doc and carol come back out of 318 they step over the fallen bodies and start toward the waiting elevator. carol stops as she recognizes rudy. doc pulls her along, forcing her to keep moving. carol again carries the brown suitcase, doc holds the shotgun. they go down the back (or front) stairs.}
