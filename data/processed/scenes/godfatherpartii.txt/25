<A>__{a large and very beautiful room overlooking the lake. it is dominated by an enormous bar, behind which stands albert neri, discreetly in the background. michael corleone sits on a large sofa, his back to us. standing to one side is a tired and somewhat uneasy tom hagen. standing before michael is sandra corleone, sonny's widow; her daughter, one of the twins, francesca corleone, and a handsome young man of twenty, gardner shaw.}

<D>__{michael, this is gardner shaw. francesca and he have been seeing each other for six months now. gardner, this is francie's uncle michael.}

<A>__{the couple sit themselves on the sofa opposite michael.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{they would like to set an engagement date, and...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{let them speak for themselves.}
<A>__{view on michael, calm, thoughtful. one can tell that he has special affection for his niece.}
<C>__{francesca}
<D>__{we love each other, uncle michael. and, we want to be married. i came to ask for your blessing.}
<A>__{there is a loud knocking on the door; then fredo's voice.}
<C>__{fredo }
<D>__{hey, mike...guess who's here?}

<C>__{fredo}
<D>__{tell mike frankie 'five angels' is here.}
<C>__{neri}
<D>__{not now...}
<A>__{neri closes the door, and michael looks at the nervous young man.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{francesca is my oldest brother's daughter. he died many years ago, and ever since i've felt much more of a father than an uncle. i love her very much. i'm pleased and impressed that you had the thought to come to me before going on with your plans. it shows me that you're a considerate man, and will be good to her. what are you studying in college?}
<C>__{gardner}
<D>__{my major is fine arts, sir.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{how will fine arts support your new wife?}

<D>__{it's embarrassing to say, sir, but i'm a major stockholder in the family corporation.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{never be embarrassed by your wealth. this recent contempt for money is still another trick of the rich to keep the poor without it.}
<P>__{(warmly)}
<D>__{of course i give you my blessing. let's set the wedding soon...it will be my pleasure to give the bride away.}
<A>__{they all smile, and rise.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...and take a few courses in business administration just to be on the safe side!}
<A>__{they laugh; michael moves toward them. francesca throws her arms around him, and kisses her favorite uncle. the flushed young man shakes his hand heartily.}
<C>__{francesca}
<D>__{thank you, uncle michael.}
<A>__{they all take their leave; michael turns to hagen.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{make her dowry impressive. he comes from a family who still thinks an italian bride goes barefoot.}
