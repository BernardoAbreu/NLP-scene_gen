<L>__{exterior main street}
<A>__{cates comes out of the doorway from which he's fired...and comes into the middle of the street, gun up ... he puts it down when he sees ganz with hammond in jeopardy. the hand that's around hammond's throat also holds the black bag. cates walks forward, his gun down at his side...}
<C>__{ganz}
<D>__{after i get outta this, cop...i'm gonna live forever...}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i don't think you're gonna make it.}
<C>__{ganz}
<D>__{whaddya mean...i got your gun ... i got his money... i got everything...}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{give up. he's crazy. he'll kill us both.}
<A>__{cates still walking...}
<C>__{ganz}
<D>__{he won't try it. he's a fucking chickenshit cop. they're all fucking wimps, right, cates?}
<A>__{they are now closer to each other. ganz holding hammond and the money...}
<C>__{ganz}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{okay, cop ... give me your gun and i will let him live. come on, cates, you're real good at giving up your gun.}
<A>__{cates keeps the same methodical pace...}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{sure...}
<A>__{suddenly, he crouches and fires twice. hammond twists as ganz also fires. ganz is hit in the collarbone and driven ten feet backward. his grip on hammond drops, hammond dives to the ground, looks at cates.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{jesus christ, i didn't think you'd really do it. you are crazy.}
<A>__{ganz' gun still in his hand, but his arm useless at his side. cates is frozen in the crouch, ready to fire again. ganz is in enormous pain holding his bleeding chest... a look of childish disbelief passes over his face.}
<C>__{ganz}
<D>__{i got hit. i can't believe it. i got shot.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{you're done. end of story.}
<C>__{ganz}
<D>__{i ain't gonna beg for my life. it ain't cool.}
<A>__{he runs at cates full speed, screaming, roaring, then is stopped by two more bullets that tear fist sized holes in his chest. cates rises from his crouch. takes his gun out of ganz' now lifeless hand. then goes over to hammond...}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{yours?}
<A>__{cates raises the pistol.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{mine...}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{cates}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{yeah. but i wasn't there for a second.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{you did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...}
<A>__{hammond smiles.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{just tryin' to get the money, jack. just tryin' to build up a few points on that merit system.}
<A>__{cates smiles back, picks up the black bag as they move off.}
