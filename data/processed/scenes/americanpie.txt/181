<L>__{interior east great falls high gym night}
<A>__{the gym is decorated in a clashingly festive manner. like a combination of mardi gras, new year's eve, and somebody's bar mitzvah. a crappy band plays crappy}
<B>__{imitation rock music.}
<A>__{most students mill about, talking, generally bored. the only people who are enjoying themselves are the obviously drunk students, slam dancing with the obviously drunk stifler in a corner. chaperone parents try to calm them down, futilely. the band breaks into a cheesy ballad. couples lock together and sway back and forth like zombies.}
<B>__{angle on jim and michelle}
<A>__{they're dancing at arm's length. jim is not enthused.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{you know, at band camp? we have dances like this. only they're way funner. don't you think prom is just highly overrated?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{highly, highly overrated.}
<B>__{angle on kevin and vicky}
<A>__{they dance. both looking a little nervous. anxious.}
<B>__{angle on oz and heather}
<A>__{dancing much slower than anyone else. tight embrace. heather's got her head on his shoulder, eyes closed.}
<B>__{angle on stifler}
<A>__{dancing with the girl holding out for finch.}
