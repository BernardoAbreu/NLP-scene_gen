<L>__{interior mrs. bruce's living room night}
<A>__{decorated in carol brady chic. when it's not gaudy, tacky, and loud, it's blander than toast. colors like lime green and sunshine orange should be reserved for popsicles only. mrs. bruce, late 30's, enters looking exhausted. she carries a glass of wine in one hand and a book in the other, erma bombeck's the grass is always greener over the septic tank. humming "we've only just begun," mrs. bruce crouches next to her wildly ancient entertainment center complete with 8 track. she flips the first record forward on her ronco record mate. album after album flaps forward. olivia newton john, neil diamond, the osmond brothers. she stops on the carpenters and sighs at the serene cover art. just what the doctor ordered. placing the vinyl on the turntable, she clicks the dustcover closed and flicks "play." reclining in her lazyboy, she sips her wine, opens the book and awaits the mellow tones of karen carpenter. suddenly, her eardrums are hammered by machine gun guitar. caustic rock 'n' roll assaults her senses. she jumps, spilling her wine all over herself. this isn't the carpenters... it's kiss! racing to the entertainment center, she turns the volume control knob so violently, it comes off in her hand. the music is even louder now. flustered by the awful noise, she tries lifting the dustcover. it's stuck. she screams and covers her ears. this is hell. running to the rear of the huge console, she stretches to reach the plug, but can't. fingertips millimeters away. as the cacophony pounds she shakes the entire stereo with all her frantic might. screeeeeech! the needle scrapes across the vinyl with a shrill, finally coming to a stop. whew, silence! then, pop, the dustcover opens unceremoniously. shaken, she grabs the record with trembling hands and reads the label...}

<L>__{exterior lex's house night}
<A>__{a small, two story house amid a suburban neighborhood of other two story houses. uninspired architecture. spindly trees. two car garage. a faint yellow glow emanates from a cellar window across which shadows frantically dart. over the crickets, we hear muffled, badly rendered rock 'n' roll. scratchy, guttural, inhuman. camera moves to the cellar window. inside we see four teenage boys who are to blame for the racket. band practice.}
<L>__{interior lex's basement bedroom night}
<A>__{an inner sanctum of kiss devotion. faux wood paneling is plastered with countless kiss posters, pictures, fold outs. the ceiling is wallpapered with more kiss posters. kiss dolls, magazines, records, comic books clutter the shag carpeted floor. fast food wrappers heap over the kiss garbage pail. the four high schoolers rock their hearts out as they blast a familiar tune offensively off key.}
<C>__{boys singing}
<D>__{"i wanna rock 'n' roll all night and party every day!"}
<A>__{they stink, but they sure are trying hard. meet the band "mystery." concert tee shirts, holey jeans, total burn outs. hawk, a scraggily haired, disenchanted youth, strains his vocal chords on the microphone as he scratches at his rhythm guitar. hawk is sort of the brains of this operation, but knowing the others, that doesn't say much. lex pounds a bass with earnest determination. lanky with bad posture, lex is already sporting worry lines. he takes everything way too seriously. trip strums lead guitar like he's hammering nails. all id, trip is slightly out of his mind. but, is it the chemicals or just his chemistry. he always wears a knit cap. jam, a sensitive kid (but no wuss), bashes on his drums like a madman making the bass drum pulsate like a spastic heart. the big drum bears the word "mystery" painted on its skin with a lightning "s" just like the kiss logo. they bring the classic tune to a shrieking conclusion and thrust their hands over their heads in the kiss symbol. hawk screams into the mike at their imaginary audience.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{thank you, cleveland! you're a great crowd. but after three and a half hours of kick ass rock and seven encores on top of that, i'm sorry to say that this time we really gotta get back to our hotel rooms and fuck some groupies.}
<A>__{behind him, trip grabs lex's bass and swings it by the neck at an amp pretending to bash it over and over again. lex quickly yanks it away from him.}

<C>__{all four boys}
<D>__{you got the best! the hottest band in the world... kiss!!}
<A>__{they all make that breath sound that mimics a screaming crowd. suddenly, headlights swing by in the window above them like a spotlight. lex hops onto the unmade bed and looks out the cellar window. lex's pov a baby shit green, ford station wagon with fake wood sides screeches into the driveway. mrs. bruce gets out and stomps toward the house. lex gasps at the sight.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{shit! it's jam's mom!}
<A>__{jam gulps as if he's just shat out an whole can of lincoln logs.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{my mom? oh, no! what's she doing here?}
<A>__{lex quickly throws a kiss towel over a tv tray hiding a bong, cigarettes, overloaded ashtray. trip kicks half empty beer bottles under the bed. hawk sprays lysol frantically around the room as jam shovels gum into his mouth. knock, knock, knock! mrs. bruce pounds on the cellar window crouching to see in. she looks like a crazed, underlit psycho.}

<A>__{she hauls jam across the lawn. hawk, lex, and trip step onto the porch looking on in sympathetic embarrassment. mrs. bruce stuffs the record in the trash can then throws jam in the front seat. screech, the station wagon pulls away.}

<D>__{jam has yet to do an overnight with us.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. i hope he doesn't get grounded again. if he misses peter criss's drum solo, i don't know if he'll be able to handle it.}

<B>__{opening title sequence}
<A>__{"rock 'n' roll all nite" blasts the way it's supposed to sound. the jammin' kiss classic is accompanied by a barrage of quick cuts depicting kiss mania. tv appearances. concert footage. magazine covers. comic books. posters. art work. kiss merchandise, dolls, lunch boxes, clothes, etc. we see the band do their thing in authentic clips from real shows. gene, paul, ace, and peter shouting it out loud. the montage is a colorful, kick ass kaleidoscope of the entire kiss phenomena. cut to : the beat of this seminal anthem. the final image is the kiss "destroyer" poster.}

<A>__{the sun's early morning rays beam through the kiss "destroyer" poster taped onto a window shade. the phone rings. jam bolts upright, his profile blocking the poster. he has just awakened under the only other decoration in his room: a crucifix. still dressed in last night's clothes, a plain black tee shirt and blue jeans, jam leaps out of bed unwittingly planting a foot in the handle of a bullworker (a piece of exercise equipment comprised of a powerful spring with two handles on either end) whose other handle is stuck under one of the bed's legs. jam runs to a phone on his dresser, drawing the bullworker's powerful springs out to maximum tension. no sooner does he pick up, when he is yanked to the floor and dragged across it as if tied to the bumper of a speeding car. despite the bullworker pulling him back toward his bed, jam does manage to get the phone to his ear.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{the phone's cord stretches taut causing its cradle to leap from the dresser and whack jam on the head.}

<A>__{jam gives the bullworker one final yank. this time it comes loose... not from his foot, but from under the bed. its handle lashes up slapping him across the face. ouch. fully awake now, jam throws on trip's denim jacket. he stuffs a drumstick into his left sock. we see "mystery" written on it. just as he's about to stick the other one in his right sock... without a second of warning, or even a knock, mrs. bruce suddenly enters. immediately jam stands.}

<D>__{jeremiah, what are you doing?}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{uhh... nothing.}
<A>__{she turns to his closet, the door blocking her view of the kiss poster. jam leaps to the window and yanks the "destroyer" shade. it shoots up, flapping around its rod. he's done this before. mrs. bruce peeks at jam from around his closet door. he stretches in front of the window.}

<C>__{mrs. bruce}
<D>__{besides, those jeans are so tight i can see your penis.}

<C>__{mrs. bruce}
<D>__{someday you'll see the futility in forging a musical career with those idiots.}
<A>__{she turns and rummages through the closet.}

<D>__{they're not idiots.}
<C>__{mrs. bruce}
<D>__{now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. i will be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic kiss music... well, need i remind you of the consequences?}

<A>__{the father has undergone a metamorphosis. he's redder than a boiling lobster, his eyes bulge and he's laughing the deepest laugh a man can without risking psychological evaluation. jam watches fascinated as the priest tries to finish the story. it's not every day you see a holy man tripping on shrooms.}

<A>__{and with that, kenny grabs himself a fistful of hawk's long hair and pulls him over to the trans am. he wipes the pizza off with hawk's hair, tugging hawk's head up and down, back and forth. hawk grunts with each wipe, but doesn't give kenny the satisfaction of hearing him scream. trip, lex, and jam watch helplessly, trapped under bobby's dull witted, but equally threatening gaze. kenny gets the last of the big chunks off his windshield and looks at his handiwork.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{there. nice and clean.}

<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{but this... is crap!}
<A>__{he flings it into the highway, where it is summarily smashed to bits under the wheels of a passing semi. follow a chunk of cartridge and a strand of mangled tape streaming from it as it sails back toward the side of the road, landing at jam's feet. tilt up to jam's face. he raises his eyes and turns to the camera, a single tear rolling down his cheek, just like the indian in that "keep america beautiful" litter ad. hawk rises and kenny comes face to face with him.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{so. all that having been said and done, i believe we are ready for the final topic of discussion. namely: have you learned your lesson yet, puke?}
<A>__{hawk pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights it. he blows some smoke in kenny's face.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{well, let's recap, shall we? you slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our love gun 8 track under the wheels of a passing semi.}
<P>__{(puffing on cig)}

<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{okay. ahem! you. are. a. dick. with. ears. and. a. really. bad. haircut.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{oh, yeah...?}
<A>__{out of original material, kenny goes for an old stand by.}

<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{it's not, huh? well, then, tell me...}
<A>__{hawk reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out his mostly empty can of hawaiian punch, holding it discreetly at his side.}

<D>__{...what exactly did my mother say last night?}

<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{you heard me, prick. what did my mother say last night?}
<A>__{kenny chuckles and looks at bobby. they have a good little laugh... the homo's got balls! then kenny turns back to hawk.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{okay, fagmo... i will tell you what your mother said last night.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{she said that i was the fuck of her life.}

<P>__{(very clint eastwood)}
<D>__{how would you like a nice hawaiian punch?}
<C>__{kenny}
<P>__{(smirking)}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{quick as a shot, hawk slams the bottom of the can into kenny's nose, crushing it flat against his face. hawaiian backwash spews from its tab hole like blood as kenny falls backwards from the impact. he hits his head on the ground. taking this as a cue... trip whips out his wallet on a chain... lex rips off his kiss belt... and jam yanks out his drumsticks. as if choreographed, trip swoops the wallet at bobby's feet, snagging him around the ankles tightly with the chain. lex thwams bobby in the face with his big kiss belt buckle leaving a reversed, red, kiss logo branded in his forehead. trip yanks the chain pulling bobby off his feet. when he hits the ground, jam's right there drumming his balls. bobby shrieks. meanwhile, hawk advances on kenny who tries to get the can off his face, but it's stuck on looking like a pig's nose with fruit punch for snot. hawk raises both his hands in kenny's face, then executes the final insult... hawk messes kenny's hair. kenny lets out a scream that comes from the bottom of his vanity. hawk grabs kenny by the ears and brings the guido's head swiftly against his kneecap. kenny falls to the ground, unconscious on top of bobby. their heads collide knocking bobby out cold. terrified, barbara leaps from the trans am and is cornered.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{not so fast, stella.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<B>__{moments later}
<A>__{kenny, bobby, and barbara are now tied to the guardrail with jam's white corduroy pants, geeky belt, and plaid shirt. kenny and bobby rest their unconscious heads on each of barbara's shoulders. hawk, trip, lex, and jam look down at the two guidos and the stella, snickering.}

<A>__{hawk puts the rock on the trans am's accelerator letting the engine whine in protest. (again we are cautious not to show the guidos' faces.)}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{by the way, when kenny wakes up could you give him a message for me. tell him, quote, kool and the gang bite my bag, motherfucker, unquote.}
<A>__{he throws the trans am into drive. all who are conscience listen to the brief screech, then watch the trans am as it barrels without a driver into the woods skirting the highway. it races into ditches, bounces off trees, and splashes through ponds, all smokey and the bandit like. the disco mobile ramps off the edge of an embankment, tumbles down a steep, rocky incline breaking apart along the way, and finally, boom! it explodes on final impact. the boys all look at each other and shrug. hawk walks back to the volvo and gets in. trip, lex, and jam follow suit and pile in as well. lex shouts back to barbara.}

<D>__{oh, thanks for letting us draw from your ample make up supply. you must have the entire revlon factory in your purse!}
<A>__{angle on kenny, bobby, and barbara. we now see them from the front. lo and behold, kenny has been made up like gene simmons, bobby like paul stanley. whoever finds them is gonna get the wrong idea about their musical taste... and kick their asses all over again.}

<C>__{jam}
<D>__{i'm gonna be spending the next two years of my life at st. bernard's boarding school, remember?! i'm gonna be outta your hair till i'm a legal adult, remember?! that way, all you have to do is go to church, light a candle, pray to a little statue for me, and voila! all is forgiven and forgotten, right mom?!! then, you can spend your days in guilt free pursuit of more constructive activities like telling everybody else how screwed up their lives are! that way you no longer need the patience and understanding required to communicate on some normal level with your own child!!! and that way you don't even have to think about how tough it was for you when you were growing up, and it's a good thing too. cause if you did, you'd realize what a lousy, goddamn, shitty ass, parent you are!!!}
<A>__{the crowd of kiss fans applaud jam's rant. mrs. bruce is utterly winded from the assault.}
<C>__{mrs. bruce}
<P>__{(timidly)}
<D>__{jeremiah... what's gotten into you?}
<C>__{jam}
<P>__{(into mr. microphone)}
<D>__{i just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! lord have mercy!!}
<A>__{the crowd cheers. jam jumps down and hands the mr. microphone back to the lead idiot. he turns to his mom.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{for the last time, mom. let me have my fucking drumsticks. please.}
<A>__{mrs. bruce reaches into the trash, finds the drumsticks and hands them to him. he spins them like pistols, then stuffs them into his socks and walks away.}
<C>__{simple plan}
<L>__{exterior it's raining men strip club night}
<A>__{hawk runs to the scalper across the street who's selling a ticket to another kiss fan.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{whoa! whoa! whoa! that better not be the last ticket! i hope you have another one for me!}
<A>__{the scalper sees hawk and bolts down the street disappearing around a corner. hawk stops. he's lost him. hawk sulks to the now familiar intersection where all four landmarks meet. he takes one more look up the block at cobo hall. nearly all the kiss fans are inside. the streets are almost deserted.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{fuck me!}
<A>__{he sees someone out of the corner of his eye across the street. it's jam. lex approaches the other corner. trip comes up to the forth corner. they all stop when they see each other. each standing on his own corner. they're all pissed. they meet in the middle of the street as last minute concert goers hurry by.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{any luck?}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{plenty, but it was all bad.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i found the volvo.}

<D>__{tickets?}
<A>__{they all shake no.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{well, dudes, the only way we're gonna see kiss this tour is by some fuckin' miracle.}
<A>__{suddenly, a commotion up the street. a surly mom yanks four}
<L>__{12 year old brats dressed like kiss by the scruffs of their}
<A>__{necks. she's furious, they're crying.}
<C>__{surly mom}
<D>__{how dare you sneak out of the house like that! you had me worried to death! don't you know this is detroit! and for a degenerate band like kiss! they're sick, sick, sick and oughta be in jail with their vile antics!}
<A>__{she throws a wad of paper to the pavement as they pass our four heroes. the dudes watch her pull the brats away.}
<C>__{surly mom}
<D>__{just wait until your father gets ahold of you!}
<A>__{jam, hawk, lex, and trip turn and look at the crumpled wad at their feet. it's an envelope. an angelic spotlight from above highlights it.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{no... you don't think...?}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{nah. couldn't be.}
<A>__{they all shake their heads in unison resolved that it isn't. then, unable to control themselves, they dive for the envelope. jam tears it open. his trembling hand reaches in. all their eyes focus like lasers on what's inside. jam pulls out four kiss tickets. their jaws drop. their eyes bug.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{it's a miracle! a miracle!}
<A>__{the boys are practically moved to tears. it's divine intervention at its finest. suddenly, a greasy hand juts out of nowhere and grabs the tickets. the boys look up shocked. they can't believe it.}
<C>__{all four boys}
<D>__{elvis?!!}
<A>__{yes, elvis. fire in his eyes. mania on his mind. and tickets in his hand.}
<C>__{elvis}
<P>__{(laughing hysterically)}
<D>__{whose laughing now?! whose laughing now, ya little shits?! i told ya... over my dead body! ha ha haaa!}
<C>__{hawk}
<P>__{(arms outstretched)}
<D>__{take it easy, elvis. don't do anything crazy. just give me the tickets before someone gets hurt.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{hey, wait a minute! this ain't school property! he's not the boss of us here!}
<C>__{elvis}
<P>__{(crazed)}
<D>__{that's right. this ain't school. it's not about school anymore. now it's personal.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{come on, elvis. we was only kiddin'. it's all in good fun. we run, you chase. cat and mouse. you know.}
<C>__{elvis}
<D>__{boys, this time... i win!}
<A>__{elvis stuffs all four tickets in his mouth and chews crazily. in seconds, gulp. elvis explodes into unhinged laughter as he runs away zigzagged down the street. our boys are left dumbstruck and speechless. after a really long pause...}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{well... i still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.}
<C>__{hawk}
<P>__{(beaten)}
<D>__{go ahead, jam.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{we all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. they gotta let us in then.}
<A>__{they stand and think for a moment. hawk's mouth curls into a devilish grin. then, he lets out a gigantic "aieee!!! and slugs jam. the four boys brutally pummel one another in the middle of the intersection. punching. kicking. headbutting.}
<L>__{exterior cobo hall night}
<A>__{two ticket takers are letting the last kiss fans in. they're about to close the doors when our four bloodied and bruised heroes come running up.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{dude, you gotta let us in! four muggers just stole our tickets!}
<C>__{ticket taker}
<P>__{(sceptical)}
<D>__{you expect us to believe that?}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{look at us!}
<A>__{trip points into the crowd of fans inside the auditorium foyer.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{it was those assholes! they even stole my wallet!}
<A>__{the ticket takers turn to see the little kid, chongo, and their two buds just going in. the ticket takers signal two security guards who proceed to stop the four stunned kids and confiscate their tickets. they find all the stolen dope and trip's wallet.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{inside that you'll find my kiss army picture i.d. and a hundred fifty bucks cash.}
<A>__{the security guards see he's right and break out the cuffs.}
<C>__{trip}
<P>__{(to little kid)}
<D>__{tsk. tsk. tsk. i was really hoping things would work out for you, my weasly, midget friend. you got spunk.}
<A>__{the little kid for once is speechless. then the ticket taker extends his arm in slow motion into cobo hall as if to say "entrez vous." the four friends pause.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{this is it!}
<A>__{they take a few slow steps almost as if they don't believe it, then run like the wind into the auditorium.}
<C>__{detroit rock city}
<L>__{interior cobo hall auditorium night}
<A>__{the lights are out. the lighters have been lit. the crowds' roar is deafening. jam, hawk, trip, and lex plow their way through the throngs and head straight for the front row just as simple simon takes the stage.}
<C>__{simple simon}
<D>__{you wanted the best! and you got the best! the hottest band in the world... kiss!!!}
<A>__{simple simon runs from the stage just as the opening chords to detroit rock city begin. on the beat, boom, fireworks shoot from the floor alighting the place. kiss takes the stage descending on hydraulic elevators. on jam, hawk, trip, and lex they're seeing god! the show is spectacular. the costumes. the make up. the blitzkrieg of pyrotechnics. the flashing kiss sign. ace's smoking guitar. gene's spewing fire. paul's rockin' vocals. peter's kick ass beat. then, something really weird happens. the crowd behind the boys heaves forward. jam is pushed like a twig in a flood and over the shoulders of those in front of him. purely by accident, he is thrown onto the stage landing on his stomach between paul and gene. just before peter's drum solo is about to start. gene, paul, and ace silence their instruments. peter throws his drumstick into the air intending to catch it when it comes down. but the sight of jam landing on the stage distracts him. all is mute as peter misses the drumstick. it hits the outside edge of one of the drums. thinking fast, jam grabs one of his drumsticks out of his sock and tosses it to peter. it tumbles through the air in slow motion with a low, whooping, helicopter sound. we see the word "mystery" clearly as it twirls. instantly, it's caught in peter criss's hand and he brings it down on his drum not missing a beat. the song resumes with all its fury as peter's drum kit ascends on a hydraulic platform. jam scrambles from the stage and leaps back into the audience barely missing the claws of some security guards. the four friends pound on each other with unbridled, teenage exuberance. will it ever get any better than this?}
