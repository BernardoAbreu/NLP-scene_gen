<L>__{int kitchen, visitor's center continuing action}
<A>__{the kids hurtle through this huge, industrial kitchen. the kitchen is a maze of turns, from the hot lamp pickup area to the rows of stainless steel burners to the chopping blocks to the potwashing area. the kids dart and duck from one area to the next, taking shortcuts under tables, crawling behind counters, scattering pots and pans behind. relentlessly, with a casual speed, the raptor stalks them. it avoids their obstacles with a casual grace and when it cannot fit through their shortcuts, it just continues around. timmy pulls open the large silvered door of the freezer. lex starts to hurry inside. timmy grabs her.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{we'll freeze to death in there.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{he's going to eat us!}
<A>__{timmy reaches into the freezer and grabs a pile of steaks. he tosses one toward the raptor. the raptor gobbles it in one bite. timmy shoves lex out of the way and begins to toss the steaks on the floor. one after the other, he tosses them, in a row, closer and closer to the open freezer. the raptor mechanically gobbles the steaks, following their path. he continues right into the freezer to grab the last of tim's bait. tim leaps and slams the heavy freezer door shut. lex comes running and throws her small weight alongside of timmy's.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{push!}
<A>__{the heave and the lock catches on the door. from inside, there is a strangled cry and the door is slammed repeatedly. the metal panels of the door buckle but they do not break. the door hinges bend and curve but they do not give. the kids collapse in relief on the kitchen floor. in just a moment, timmy is back on his feet.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{what is it, timmy?}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{i just remembered something. rapto}
<A>__{rs are}
<D>__{born in large litters. there's probably more coming. we gotta hide.}
<A>__{he grabs her hand and they run out of the back entrance of the kitchen. there's a stairway and they race up.}
