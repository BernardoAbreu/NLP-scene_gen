<A>__{rebels jumping out of the pickup truck and moving up the bridge as agnete approaches holding up her hands }
<C>__{agnete}
<D>__{it's ok we are a relief convoy }
<A>__{agnete and the lra leader meet in the middle of the bridge }
<C>__{agnete }
<D>__{we have only medical supplies non military }
<A>__{and suddenly the lra leader slams her in the gut with the butt of his rifle and she collapses. the other rebels swarm all over the convoy, pulling out aid workers and drivers, forcing them onto their knees in a group.}
<D>__{adult rebel #3 get on your knees!... get down!...}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{please don't kill us! adult rebel #4}
<P>__{(arabic)}

<A>__{everyone terrified some of them sobbing agnete looking up, trying to talk to the lra leader }
<C>__{agnete}
<D>__{we are only a relief convoy }
<C>__{lra leader}
<D>__{shut your mouth!}
<A>__{ and he slams her in the face with the butt of his rifle and she goes down hard... and he rests the barrel of his rifle on the back of her head... he's going to shoot her and kak! kak! kak! his chest explodes! three bursts from behind the other rebels spinning toward the gunshots as kratakratakratakrak!!! a firestorm of lead sam, deng, and the rest of his team coming onto the bridge shooting rebels scrambling for cover but it's too late dropping as they try and sprint away and in an instant it's all over. agnete sees sam, rushes toward him, but when he looks at her she freezes. he is completely unrecognizable to her in this moment a killer's thousand yard stare barely human more like a machine than a man. and he moves past her down the bridge, to the lra leader on the ground who is still alive. and he puts the barrel of his rifle against the rebel's head and... boooom! he's dead. just like that. and he continues walking up the bridge. and we see agnete, deng and the other soldiers having just witnessed this.}
