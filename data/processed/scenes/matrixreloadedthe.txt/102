<A>__{smith stands, facing neo, about two fighting distances away. neos concentration is broken. the metacortex building comes to a shuddering halt.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{youre back.}
<A>__{cu: smith}
<D>__{he nods.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{and you have a ponytail now.}
<A>__{as we concentrate on neo, and he concentrates on smith, we can see more black suits marching up behind him. neo attacks smith. smith backs away slowly, blocking against a losing battle and taking hits. meanwhile, the men in black converge on neo. just as neo lands a smashing blow on smiths chin, three voices at once shout:}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{neo turns, and smith pushes him hard in the opposite direction to face: three smiths! they attack at once, one going low and hard with a knee breaking sweep kick, the other punching neo in the face, and the third breaking to the side and putting his toe into neos stomach with a vicious side kick. they attack is in perfect synch, eight arms and eight legs working like clockwork, striking their target without getting in the way of each other. the attack slams neo back, right into the first, bloodied smith. neo slams into his shoving arms, and stops as though he backed into a brick wall. agent smith grabs him and holds him in a full nelson, exposing him to his three copies. the copies shift position and attack again. two stand together, left shoulder to right, and with their combined arms slam neo in the face, then step apart as the third comes in. the third grabs the shoulders of the other two and flips, walking his loafers up neos body, and kicking him from below, right up into the chin of his jaw! it snaps neos back with a spray of blood.}
