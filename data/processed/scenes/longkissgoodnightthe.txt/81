<L>__{interior casino bar evening}
<A>__{henessey watches, fascinated. all the little mannerisms, the differences. shaking out a match, running a hand through her hair... and never missing a thing, eyes constantly roving, scanning. guard never down. she plucks a drink from a nearby table, steals it outright.}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{see? sit next to the dance floor, every drink's free. people finish dancing, they think the waiter lifted 'em.}
<A>__{henessey grimaces. clears his throat, says:}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{i'm confused. gimme a minute.}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{take two, they're small.}
<A>__{she knocks back her drink. no hesitation. henessey shifts uncomfortably, lights a smoke.}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{okay. let's say i buy it. you're actually a trained killer, jesus, i can't even say it with a straight face.}
<P>__{(frowns)}
<D>__{so then... samantha, she...}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{never really existed. like nathan said, she was a total fabrication, i made her up.}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{fabrication. and now she's just... gone? forever and ever?}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{thank god. look at my inordinately large ass, look what she did to me.}
<A>__{henessey squirms, this one's gonna take some time to digest.}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{pretty convincing act.}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{guess so.}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{i mean, her personality, it had to come from somewhere }
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{change the subject. better yet, steal me another drink.}
<A>__{henessey sighs. next to him a couple get up to dance. he reaches over and lifts their beers.}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{drink up. what's next?}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{i called chapter. i'm trying to bring us in from the field alive...}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{chapter. can you trust them?}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{not sure. until i know, you might wanna stay away from curbs.}
<A>__{he looks at her, confused:}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{they like to push people in front of buses.}
<A>__{didn't need to know that. a dancing santa goes by:}
<C>__{santa claus}
<P>__{(bad caribbean accent)}
<D>__{hey, lady, santa want to dance the lambada wit'choo. come this way, everybody!}
<A>__{he shimmies away. charly grins at henessey:}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{if i could come that way i wouldn't need to dance the lambada. follow me, i need you to do something.}
