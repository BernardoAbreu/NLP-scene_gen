<A>__{we see a fairground, then a roller rink, and a wrestling ring, and finally a small portable stage in the center of a circular track. the grandstands are partially ruled and stock cars roar from another part or the field; around the stage we see a sign that says, "talent show tonight" and we see the contestants and the mc, and norman doing a routine with an accordion player. after norman finishes, the nc takes the mike.}
