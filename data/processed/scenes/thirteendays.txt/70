<L>__{interior reception hall sheraton blackstone night}
<A>__{a big 100 dollar a plate dinner is in full swing to a dinner band's tunes. the president and chicago mayor richard daly make the rounds among the fund raising crowd. kenny follows them at a respectful distance, greeting old cronies. suddenly a messenger hustles over to kenny, hands him a note. kenny makes eye contact with the president, nods and leaves.}
<L>__{interior hotel elevators night}
<A>__{kenny waits at the elevator. scotty saunters up behind him. he sizes kenny up, clears his throat. kenny turns around.}
<C>__{reston}
<D>__{there are major rail disruptions in the south, two airborne divisions are on alert. that exercise is an invasion.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{well, you know how bobby has it in for the state of mississippi.}
<C>__{reston}
<D>__{this is about cuba.}
<A>__{kenny freezes, then explodes.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{cuba? you're fucking crazy. we are not invading cuba. nobody gives a rat's ass about cuba. not now, not ever. if you print something like that, all you're going to do is inflame the situation. nobody talks to assholes who inflame situations. assholes like that can find themselves cut out of the loop.}
<A>__{reston is taken aback. stung silence for a beat. kenny's response is far louder than any "yes." now kenny realizes it.}
<C>__{reston}
<D>__{you've never threatened me before.}
<A>__{and kenny looks away, upset, but when he turns back to reston, all that's there is his poker face. the elevator arrives.}
<C>__{reston }
<D>__{all right. i'm not going to print anything until i have another source. but i promise you, i will get one.}
<A>__{kenny boards the elevator. the doors shut on scotty.}
