<A>__{two hours later. grace is in the same spot. smokey is gone, doing his work. annie has taken a different position, looking over several pages of faxes on her lap. tom is still standing in the pen trying to get pilgrim's eyes. joe has joined the proceedings, sitting on the pen rail. tom deftly throws a hoolihan, gently lassoing pilgrim around the neck. and pilgrim, at the touch of the rope, crazed, resists, pulling back, striking at the rope... the rope cutting into tom's hands. tom gives him some slack, giving his head, letting him relax... then gently heads him by the rope, walking him around the pen, getting his feet to moving. grace's eyes never leave tom.}
