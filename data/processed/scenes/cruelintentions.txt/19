<L>__{interior estate stable day}
<A>__{sebastian and annette put the riding gear away.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{so what year are you going into?}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{junior.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{got a boyfriend back home?}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{i don't know. relationships seem too distracting. i'd rather concentrate on my studies.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{you a lesbo?}
<C>__{annette}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she bends over to pick up the saddle.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{nice.}
<A>__{she sighs, disgusted, then turns toward him.}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{are you often this offensive on a first encounter?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i was just being honest. you happen to have a nice ass. sorry.}
<A>__{she shakes her head and continues with her chore.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i read your teen beat manifesto.}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{you did?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i must say i found it rather appalling.}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{that's a first. most people praised me for it.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{most people are morons. i mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{i wasn't knocking anything. it's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{oh really?}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{take yourself. you've slept with several women. are you happier because of it?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{how do you know i've been with several women?}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{a friend wrote me.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<P>__{(pissed)}
<D>__{well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.}
<A>__{an uncomfortable silence falls between them,}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{it's not really important.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{fine, forget it. it's obvious that we're not going to be friends.}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{why are you being so dramatic?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{look, i've got a lot of problems and i'm trying to deal with them and the last thing i need is people spreading shit about me.}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{alright, i said i was sorry.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{can we start over again? i think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.}
<A>__{she approaches him and they shake.}
<C>__{annette }
<D>__{annette harrison.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{sebastian valmont.}
<A>__{she smiles, but before he releases her hand:}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{so tell me, annette. i'm curious, since you've never had sex do you touch yourself?}
<A>__{she whisks her hand away and storms out of the stable.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{what did i say?}
