<A>__{jussac leads a regiment of the cardinal's gruards down paris' most colorful and notorious street. they react to shouting and violent noises coming from a tavern ahead. the one called... the dead rat. the tavern door flies open, and two of the cardinal's guards are flung into the street, bruised and bloody. just then: a window on the second floor bursts open, and a big musketeer dangles a struggling guard by his feet, threatening to drop him into the street. the musketeer, a man of enormous appetites wine, women, song is called porthos. jussac shouts:}

<D>__{release that man!!}
<A>__{happy to comply, porthos lets go of the guard who plunges to the street with a dull thud. then, with a wink and a piratical grin, porthos ducks inside. jussac darkens, signals his men, and they rush toward the tavern.}
