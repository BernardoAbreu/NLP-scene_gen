<D>__{sure. but that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i just wish it was that simple. we really were in love. you know how it is when you laugh all the time.}
