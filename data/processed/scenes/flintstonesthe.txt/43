<A>__{long matte shot slate quarry late afternoon fibrerock products are stacked up everywhere, stretching away like the inventory in charles foster kane's warehouse. we see everything from fibrerock bricks to fibrerock table lamps to fibrerock toilets. music out. closer quarry yard fred and barney, weary, approach each other, shake hands as they view the day's incredible output. other weary, but proud workers gather around them: mr. slate is about to address them from his office balcony.}
<C>__{slate}
<D>__{men, this is a proud day for slate construction. you have seen the first pieces of fibrerock roll off the assembly line and into history... a history you are all part of... thanks to your very own fellow worker, fred flintstone!}
<A>__{workers favoring fred and barney they cheer slate's remarks, pat fred on the back.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{slate}
<D>__{no longer will man and beast bend under the backbreaking load of stone and rock and timber... because fibrerock is so light that even a child can handle it.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{that's why on monday we're going to hire two dozen children from bedrock technical junior high. they'll be replacing the 36 heavy equipment operators, 15 shaft diggers and 22 laborers we're laying off today. your pink slips will be in your final pay envelopes along with a ticket to the grand opening of slate city. it's non transferable, so hang on to it. thank you, and have a nice weekend.}

<A>__{the workers stand slack jawed and stunned.}
<D>__{worker #1 laid off ? worker #2 pink slip ? worker #3 thanks to fred flintstone? worker #4 flintstone! what kinda shop steward are you?}
<A>__{all eyes swivel and bore into fred, who is as shocked as anyone.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{fred. you gotta do something about this!}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{i do?}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{i mean, i do, yeah!}
<A>__{he squares his shoulders, marches off.}
