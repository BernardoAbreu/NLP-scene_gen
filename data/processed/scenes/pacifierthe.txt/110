<A>__{there are toys everywhere like a tornado hit a toys r us. shane fends the ninjas off. he spots a baseball bat, and grabs it, facing them, fiercely. they step back...}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{okay who wants some?}
<A>__{shane swings the bat down on a ninja's head: it's a whiffle bat, it makes a silly thunk. shane and the ninja share a surprised look then the ninjas charge. shane fends them off with his whiffle bat. with his foot, he picks up a fisher price corn popper, and uses them both to fend off blows. it rattles and pops as he fights with both toys until a ninja breaks them with one blow. shane sees a farmer john talking game. he jumps up onto a shelf and grabs it. he pulls the string, and swings the plastic disk like a deadly bolo.}

<D>__{ow! ow!}
<A>__{shane sees: the ninjas are wearing only ninja socks no shoes. he grabs a barrel of legos, and flings them all over the floor. the ninjas move towards him the legos and jacks dig into their feet.}
<D>__{ninja furbies ow! ow ow! crap!}
<A>__{the ninjas fight as they hobble around, avoiding legos, shane runs to the changing table, then violently squeezes desitin at a ninja, blinding him. shane hangs in the doorway and swings at them, kicking a ninja in the chest. the ninja crashes through the window! he other ninja looks up, fearful. suddenly he grabs a bottle of baby powder. he sprays it in shane's face... poof! the room fills with a cloud of white. angle shane he squints, blinded. the cloud dissipates... and shane sees he's now alone. he runs to the broken window.}
