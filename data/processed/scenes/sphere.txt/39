<A>__{empty, sterile. we hear the repeating sound: thwap. almost like a dripping faucet. thwap... thwap...}

<A>__{harry on his bunk, staring at the wall, flicking his middle finger at his cheek: thwap... thwap.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you realize, norman, that we are all going to die.}
<A>__{norman is lying in his own bunk, below harry.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{don't be so optomistic, harry.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm completely serious. there is something very important missing from that spacecraft. you know what that is?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{not a clue.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{a sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i don't follow you.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{on that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "unknown entry event." they didn't know what a black hole was. fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{so what?}
<A>__{harry leans his head over his bunk.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{so, e know}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we know it went through a black hole. we saw it. norman when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we? it'd go in some report like some big discovery. so in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but they didn't the called it an unknown entry event.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.}
<A>__{norman gets out of his bed.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i can't believe that, harry.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{gimme another explanation.}
<A>__{norman pacing.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i can't. if i had a minute to think, maybe, but i know you're wrong.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{am i?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{look we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you mean, you think i'm cracking?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{no. i didn't say that.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{then what, norman?}
<A>__{norman stops pacing, a beat.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it's what's in that sphere, isn't it, harry? whatever you think is in that thing you think it's going to kill you.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{curious, isn't it? what's inside? before i die, i'd sure like to open it and see.}
