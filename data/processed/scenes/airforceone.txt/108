<D>__{okay. have it your way.}
<A>__{time for a deadly version of the shell game. serge fires several rounds into the first closed bathroom door. the bullets slice easily through the thin doors. he kicks the riddled door open. the stall is empty. serge moves to the next one. same procedure. it's empty. moves to the last bathroom, confident he's got him. he wails with his mp5, turning the hatch into swiss cheese. waits a beat, then... kicks it in. it's empty too. serge looks around. where the hell is this guy?}
