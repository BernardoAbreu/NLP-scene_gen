<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{you said you owed styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?}
<A>__{hardy whirls on her.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{west was a monster! fifteen years ago, i was here, i was section eight, i was pike. fuck being the knife dummy that thing he did, stripping pike down, making him stand outside all night? he did that every year, he did that to me. fifteen years ago, i wanted him dead, and now i'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? sorry, no can do. i tried.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{you did more than try. you cracked dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{phenomenal at taking bribes, right?}
<A>__{a beat. osborne shakes her head.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{i was starting to believe you, you know? that you weren't who everyone said. i guess i was wrong }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! this isn't my "great second chance", osborne. everyone thinks i'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. nobody will ever know what happens here }
<C>__{osborne}

<A>__{hardy stares at her.}
<C>__{hardy}

<A>__{hardy looks back up at her. speaking softly:}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i didn't shoot west...}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{dunbar... he said he didn't shoot west. west wasn't shot, kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and dunbar never saw the body.}
<A>__{they stare at each other for a moment...}
