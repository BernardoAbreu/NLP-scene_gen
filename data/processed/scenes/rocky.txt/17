<L>__{exterior interior gym day}
<A>__{mickey's gym is surrounded by bars and a couple of greasy spoons. out front a crowd of young blacks talk and jive among themselves. two winos lean against the entrance. rocky enters the gym... the place is nearly full. the measured beat of skip ropes and throbbing speed bags makes the room come alive, like it was a mindless piece of machinery. over the loudspeaker music by the isley brothers blares out... the music adds a background to the clang of the automatic timers, snorting sparring partners and the thudding of heavy bags. the room is divided fifty percent black thirty five percent latin ten percent white five percent other. as rocky walks through the gym many of the fighters pause to wave and yell greetings.}
