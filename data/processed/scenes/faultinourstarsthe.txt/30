<L>__{int gus's basement later}
<A>__{hazel descends the steps. she hears an ungodly moan before she sees anyone. what has she gotten herself into? gus appears at the base.}
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(calling to isaac)}
<D>__{isaac, hazel from support group is coming downstairs.}
<A>__{gus waits for a response. none comes. he gestures for her to follow him into the room. before he does:}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{a gentle reminder: isaac is in the midst of a psychotic episode.}
<P>__{(hazel nods)}
<D>__{you look nice, by the way.}
<A>__{hazel blushes, follows gus into the room to find isaac sitting upside down in a gaming chair. tears are flowing down his reddened cheeks. empty soda cans and bags of junk food lie around him.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{how ya doing isaac?}
<A>__{again, no response. hazel looks to gus for an explanation.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{seems isaac and monica are no longer a going concern.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{oh i'm sorry.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{do you want to talk about it?}
<A>__{isaac starts to sob again.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{he just wants to cry and play video games.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{fair enough.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{it doesn't hurt to talk to him, however. if you have any sage words of feminine advice...}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i actually think his response is appropriate.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{"pain demands to be felt."}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(lights up at that)}
<D>__{you're quoting my book!}
<A>__{gus winks at her. at which point, isaac lets out another howl. gus gestures for hazel to sit. the two of them flank isaac. he finally speaks.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{she didn't want to do it after the surgery. said she couldn't handle it. i'm about to lose my eyesight and she can't handle it.}
<A>__{hazel rubs his shoulder in sympathy.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{i kept saying "always" to her. always, always, always. and she just kept talking over me and not saying it back. it was like i was already gone, you know? "always" was a promise! you can't break promises.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{sometimes people don't understand the promises they're making when they make them.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{right, sure, but you keep the promise anyway. that's what love is. love is keeping the promise anyway.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{that could be an "encouragement."}
<A>__{it's silent for a beat. and then isaac stands up, a funny look on his face.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{isaac...?}
<A>__{suddenly isaac starts kicking his chair across the room.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{here we go...}
<A>__{the chair lands against the bed. gus hands isaac something else to throw, a pillow. isaac grabs the pillow and slams it against the wall. he dives on it and beings pummeling the pillow like a maniac.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{that's it! punch that thing.}
<A>__{and so he does. as he continues to, gus looks at hazel, cigarette dangling from his mouth.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i've been wanting to call you on a nearly minutely basis but i have been waiting until i could form a coherent thought in re: "an imperial affliction."}
<P>__{(she smiles)}
<D>__{i can't stop thinking about it.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i know, right?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{the only problem is the ending.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{it is rather abrupt.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{it's torture! i mean, i totally get that she died or whatever anna. but there is an unwritten contract between author and reader and i think ending your book in the middle of a sentence kind of violates that contract.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{but that's part of what i like about it. it portrays death truthfully. you die in the middle of your life, in the middle of a sentence. but i do god, i do want to know what happens to everyone else.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{yeah like her mom.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{the dutch tulip man...}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{sysiphus the hamster...}
<A>__{hazel beams. gus totally gets the book. a bond between them.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{have you tried contacting this... peter van houten?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i've written letters. he's never responded. apparently he moved to amsterdam, became a recluse. hasn't published anything. doesn't do interviews.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{sad.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{hang on.}
<P>__{(turns to isaac)}
<D>__{isaac!}
<A>__{gus stands and takes the pillow out of isaac's hand.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{pillows don't break.}
<A>__{gus hands isaac one of his basketball trophies.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{you need to break something.}
<A>__{isaac looks at it, then back to gus as if asking permission. gus nods. isaac holds it over his head and smash! the trophy breaks into a million pieces. isaac almost smiles. gus hands him another.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{go to town, my friend.}
<A>__{and isaac does. smashing them one by one. hazel looks at gus.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i've been looking for a way to tell my dad that i kinda hate basketball. think maybe we've found it.}
<A>__{isaac grabs more of the trophies, smashing them to pieces. gus and hazel enjoy the spectacle. when there are none left isaac is panting, standing over the bronze carnage.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{feel better?}
<A>__{isaac thinks about it. shakes his head no. gus puts his arm around him but looks at hazel.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{that's the thing about pain... it demands to be felt.}
<A>__{hazel smiles. and on her face, we cut to:}
