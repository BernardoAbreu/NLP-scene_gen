<A>__{betty has the car at 75 m.p.h., on the rural kansas roads, wheat fields for miles on both sides of her. the radio is blasting bonnie raitt and she's singing along. she sees her speed and punches the accelerator ... 80 m.p.h. ... 85 ... 90 m.p.h. she turns the radio up louder. when she approaches a sign saying "you are leaving kansas" betty suddenly becomes self conscious. she eases up on the gas ... slows down ... does a u turn and heads back toward fair oaks. she glances wistfully in her rear view mirror at the billboard that quickly fades into the distance.}
