<L>__{interior becky's toyota night}
<A>__{the car pulls into the driveway of todd's house. becky is smoking a joint and blowing the smoke out the window. they both look a little tipsy, as if they have been to a party. she holds the joint up to todd. he contemplates, then takes it. todd's first toke of marijuana isn't very small. becky looks on, surprised. she reaches out for the joint and todd waves her off. he pulls again, this time ingesting a huge hit. he holds it, then exhales. he gives the roach back to becky.}

<A>__{becky gets out. todd slides over and does the same. she crushes the joint out on the pavement and puts the rest in her purse.}
