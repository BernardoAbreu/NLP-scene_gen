<L>__{45.interior church night}
<A>__{lisa enters a church full of powerful religious imagery. on the right side of the entrance she notices a font. a drop of blood pierces the blessed water. as lisa walks down the aisle we realise that everything has slowed to a crawl and she is moving in slow motion. white feathers cover the aisle, bouncing around her bare feet. an open bible rests on the lectern, the pages fluttering as if there is a strong breeze blowing them. lisa looks up at a crucifix on the wall, the contorted face of a crucified jesus christ stares at her. blood seeps from the crown of thorns and runs down christ's face. as lisa gets closer to the altar she sees a female figure sat in the front pew. lisa ebbs closer. the figure turns. it's lisa's mother.}
<C>__{lisa's mother}
<D>__{don't you grieve for me?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{of course i do.}
<A>__{suddenly tears of blood run down lisa's cheeks. lisa's mother reaches out a hand. lisa stretches her arm out to grab her mother's hand. everything is in slow motion, it seems to take lisa forever to reach her mother's hand. suddenly a black gloved hand grabs her outstretched arm. she turns to see a hooded figure, face shrouded in darkness, standing next to her. a deep voice echoes around the church:}
