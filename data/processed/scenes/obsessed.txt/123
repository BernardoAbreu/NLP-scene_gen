<A>__{samantha is sprawled on the couch. the tv is going, she's listening to music on her i pod while texting a friend on her phone and paging through a teen magazine all at the same time, multi tasking. she doesn't hear the door bell ring the first time. or the second. then there's a loud knocking. samantha becomes aware, looks around, then sees a shadowy figure through the frosted window next to the door. with a sigh of annoyance, samantha gets up and goes to the door. she unlocks and opens it. lisa is standing on the threshold, looking fresh and pretty and smiling.}
