<L>__{ext allen street oriental night}
<A>__{curly bill steps out with ike and ringo. he looks around.}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{i feel like doin' somethin'. getting woolly.}
<P>__{(looks up)}
<D>__{hey, chinky! come here a minute...}
<A>__{an old chinaman minces by. curly bill dashes after him... back & forth int ext oriental allen street night later. doc is at the piano, drunk as a lord but playing chopin flawlessly. kate pours him another drink.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{that's my lovin' man. just can't get enough.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{enough? never.}
<A>__{now the high roller comes reeling up, loud and gratingly drunk.}
<C>__{high roller}
<D>__{hey, is that "old dog tray"? sounds like "old dog tray".}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{high roller}
<D>__{you know, stephen foster. "oh, susanna". "camptown races", stephen stinkin' foster!}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i see, well this happens to be a nocturne.}
<C>__{high roller}
<D>__{a which?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{you know, frederic fucking chopin.}
<A>__{doc plays on. josephine leaves with behan. morgan sighs:}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{now that wounds me. little tin swain walkin' off with that black beauty. i mean i'm a married man and all but still, it ain't right.}
<A>__{wyatt grunts and nods, perturbed. outside the others mount up but curly bill stands drugged up in the middle of the street, arms out, head back, eyes closed, luxuriating in the moonlight.}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{boy, i feel great! full of that hop i got from chinky. i feel just capitol! you boys go ahead. i'm gonna stick around awhile, howl at the moon.}
<A>__{the others shrug and ride off. curly bill pulls his pistol, spinning it. back inside the oriental it's late, few patrons remain. a few beats then suddenly everyone jumps as gunshots echo from outside. white goes to the window, looks outside:}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{curly bill. he's over across the street shootin' out the lights.}
<C>__{clum}
<D>__{this is great, this is just great.}
<A>__{just then behan dashes in, white as a sheet, josephine in tow:}
<C>__{behan}
<D>__{have you been out in the street? somebody's got to do something.}
<C>__{clum}
<D>__{you're the sheriff.}
<C>__{behan}
<D>__{it's not county business, it's a town matter.}
<A>__{outside curly bill starts taking potshots at a passerby's feet, making him dance down the street and scurry for cover. curly bill cackles. inside white turns uneasily to wyatt:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{why don't you just leave it alone?}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{no, i gotta do something. i don't suppose you'd card }
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{none of my business, fred.}
<A>__{wyatt keeps dealing, doc keeps playing. white draws himself up and exits. outside, curly bill reloads and keeps shooting. white steps out into the street. we feel a sense of inverted terror as he draws his gun and we see that his hand is trembling. he crosses the street, coming up behind curly bill:}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{hey, curly? come on now, boy...}
<A>__{curly bill spins around. white's gun stares him in the face.}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{well, howdy, fred!}
<A>__{back in the bar, wyatt puts his cards down, looks over at doc.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{maybe i ought to go out there.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{you will or you won't. don't look to me. i'm going to sleep.}
<A>__{doc lays his head down on the keys, passes out. wyatt frowns for a moment. finally he stands, turning to morgan:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{go wake up virgil.}
<P>__{(turns to joyce)}
<D>__{hey milt, lend me a sidearm, will you?}
<A>__{joyce hands him a colt from under the bar. outside white covers curly bill, trembling harder now. an adrenaline rush in a man white's age is hard to look at, he seems so frail, so vulnerable. even his voice has a quavering edge to it:}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{hand that over. come on now.}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{why sure, dad. i'm only in fun. here she is.}
<A>__{with a reassuring smile, curly bill holds his pistol out butt first. white reaches for it, visibly relieved. but quick as a snake's tongue curly bill spins it around and fires point blank into white's chest, blowing him over backward, the blast so close it sets his clothes on fire. curly bill turns just as wyatt flashes into frame and slams him over the head with his pistol barrel, laying him out in a groaning heap. wyatt glances at white lying semi conscious in the street, chest heaving, eyelids fluttering, making weak little bird like sounds, smoke rising from his smoldering shirt and vest. clum runs up:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{put his clothes out.}
<A>__{clum pats the embers out in white's clothes but as wyatt starts to haul curly bill up he suddenly finds himself surrounded by ike, billy clanton, and six other cowboys.}
<C>__{ike}
<D>__{turn loose of him.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{he just killed a man.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{he said to turn loose of him.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{well i'm not so go home.}
<C>__{ike}
<D>__{swear to god, mister, step aside or we'll tear you apart.}
<A>__{the cowboys tense up, ready for action. wyatt holds his ground, his hard, steady gaze zeroing in on ike:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{you. come here a second.}
<A>__{ike steps up, full of brass. without warning wyatt jabs the muzzle of his pistol into his forehead, snapping his head back. wyatt cocks the pistol. the other cowboys hush. ike freezes. wyatt's eyes bore into him.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{you die first, get it? the others might get me in a rush but before that i'm gonna make your head into a canoe. understand?}
<A>__{ike stands stock still. billy steps forward, undaunted:}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{he's bluffin'! let's rush him!}
<A>__{this is it. the cowboys poise themselves, ready to start, but:}
<C>__{o.s. voice}
<D>__{and you, you simpleton, you're nexterior}
<A>__{again a hush. doc stands behind wyatt, still drunk, but with his .38 trained on billy. billy sneers:}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{hell, he can't hit nothin'. he's so drunk he's probably seein' double.}
<A>__{doc pulls out his .45, training it, too, on billy:}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i have two guns. one for each of you.}
<A>__{billy pauses, chastened. suddenly there's another commotion as virgil and morgan bull their way through the crowd from behind with shotguns.}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{all right, look out! break it up. go home, all of you, go home now...}
<A>__{this breads the group's will and things suddenly calm down dramatically as the cowboys disperse. wyatt lowers his pistol, heaving a sigh of relief as he pulls the still groggy curly bill to his feet and hauls him reeling toward the jail.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{come on, you...}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{crack me back of the head like some stinkin' bull. hell, you ain't no fightin' man, you're just a cop.}
