<L>__{exterior the white lotus temple day}
<A>__{the bride sits in the jeep, by herself, parked in front of the priest pai mei's home located high up on top of white lotus mountain. for over 100 years, his home used to be the temple of the white lotus clan, and he was the temple's head priest. the temple served as a home to over 60 priests and disciples. but now the year 1990 the white lotus clan is no more. all the priests have died. all that remains, is a very old man, who once upon a time, some worshipped as a god and some feared as a devil...neither was wrong. a huge stone staircase of one hundred steps climb up a hill leading to pei mei's home. bill climbs down to the jeep.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{he'll accept you as his student.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{caught him in a good mood, aye?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{more like a sadistic one.}
<A>__{she climbs out, and gets her bag out of the back. bill casts a glance at the stone steps he just decended.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{just seeing those steps again makes me ache. you're gonna have plenty of fun carrying buckets of water up and down that fucker.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{why did he accept me?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{because he's a very very very old man. and like all rotten bastards, when they get old, they become lonely. not that that has any effect on their disposition. but they do learn the value of company.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{when will i see you again?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{that's the title of my favorite soul song of the seventies.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{nothing. when he tells me you're done.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{when do you think that might be?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{that my dearest, all depends on you. now remember, no backtalk, no sarcasm. least not for the first year. you're going to have to let him warm up for you. he hates caucasians, despises americans, and has nothing but contempt for women, so in your case, that may take a little while. adios.}
<B>__{zoom...}
<A>__{the jeep speeds off down the road...leaving the bride all alone, somewhere in the middle of china. she begins the journey before her by ascending the 100 steps to pai mei.}
