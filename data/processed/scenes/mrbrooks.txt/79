<D>__{i know you're upset, mr. smith, and i'm sorry.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{yeah, i am upset.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{maybe i was a little abrupt back there, but let me explain. finding someone you think would be fun to kill is a bit like falling in love. you meet a lot of candidates, and you like some of them and they're nice, but they're not right; and then that special one shows up and your heart beats faster and you know that's the one. the man in the pickup did not make my heart beat faster.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{okay, he did not make your heart beat faster. if not him, who?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i don't know, i think i have someone in mind.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{do you need me to do any work on it?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{no, let's see how it plays out.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{you see? that's my problem. that makes me feel like i'm being jerked around, mr. brooks. i thought it was happening last night, then it was happening tonight. and now it's "let's see how it plays out".}
<C>__{mr. smith }
<D>__{i feel like you're planning to back out on our deal and i don't like that feeling at all.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i promise you, it will happen.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{when? that's what i want to know, mr. brooks. when?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{tomorrow night, same time. when you come out of your building, turn right, go to the first street you can go west on, i will pick you up on that street.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{he gets out and with the door still open, turns back.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{i want to do this. but if it drags on too long, i could change my mind.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{don't you think i want to do this, mr. smith?}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{maybe you don't anymore.}
<A>__{he shuts the door. marshall and mr. brooks watch him walk away.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{even if that guy was charming and funny i still wouldn't like him.}
