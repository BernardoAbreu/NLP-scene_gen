<L>__{exterior tortuga dock later day}
<A>__{on the docks, a disheveled, motley and weatherbeaten group of about a dozen swabs stand in a ragged line up.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{feast your eyes, cap'n. all of 'em good sea faring men, faithful hands before the mast, every one worth his salt }
<P>__{(sotto, making his point)}
<D>__{ and crazy, to boot.}
<A>__{jack holds up a hand enough. he moves down the line, gibbs at his side. then he notices anamaria in line, dressed like a man, he raises an eyebrow.}
<C>__{anamaria}
<D>__{you owe me a boat.}
<A>__{jack nods, continues. one sailor is quite fat, another thin and sickly. jack is not happy with his choices. he stops in front of cotton, a short sailor with a large, colorful parrot on his shoulder. jack raises an eyebrow.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{cotton here is mute, sir. poor devil had his tongue cut out }
<A>__{cotton opens his mouth to show this jack grimaces.}
<C>__{gibbs }
<D>__{ so he went and trained the parrot to do the talking for him, nobody knows how. nobody knows the parrot's name, neither, so we just call it 'cotton's parrot.'}
<A>__{jack decides to test this.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{mr. cotton. do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders and stay true, in the face danger, and almost certain death?}
<A>__{cotton lifts the parrot off his shoulder, raises it }
<C>__{cotton's parrot}
<D>__{wind in your sails! wind in your sails!}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{mostly, that seem to mean 'yes.'}
<A>__{cotton nods vigorously, lowers the parrot, and it goes silent. jack shakes his head. steps back.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that goes for the rest of you! danger and near certain death.}
<P>__{(turns away)}
<D>__{for we are to sail for the isla de muerta, to rescue the daughter of governor swann. an equal share of the reward shall be }
<A>__{jack hears movement, looks back several potential crew members back away in fright; first one, then another, turn and run, followed by more. soon just a half dozen are left, including cotton (with parrot) and anamaria.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{shut up, before you lose them all!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{these are the only ones worth having.}
<P>__{(glances at the sky)}
<D>__{and we're going to need them }
