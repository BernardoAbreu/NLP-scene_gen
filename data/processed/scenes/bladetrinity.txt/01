<L>__{exterior iraqi desert dawn}
<A>__{harsh sunlight beats down over a bleak, unforgiving stretch of rocky desert. amidst this desolation rise the ruins of an ancient sumerian ziggurat, a massive stepped pyramid of mud brick that was once the center of the city known as ur. super title: southeastern iraq, dhi qar province}
<B>__{six months ago an emaciated sheep herder}
<A>__{kneels by the ziggurat, tending to a ragged band of sheep. he is conducting the first of his daily prayers, listening to a religious broadcast from baghdad on a tinny radio. presently, we hear helicopters. the sheepherder looks up two anerican rah 66 comanche helicopters approach from the east. they touch down near the base of the ziggurat, rotors stirring up clouds of dust.}
<B>__{four figures}
<A>__{disembark, their bodies covered in desert camo gear. they wear helmets with polarized face plates and are armed to the teeth. to the sheepherder they might as well be aliens. one of the figures turns to the east. we can see the rising sun reflected in the face plate of his helmet and a hint of a skull like under mask respirator beneath the face plate. he raises a gloved hand, gives the "finger" to the new day. another figure (a woman) waves a hand, urging them onward. they mount the central steps of the ziggurat.}
