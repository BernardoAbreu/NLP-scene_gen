<A>__{(scene 2000 stoick's sacrifice) with his tail impaired, cloudjumper struggles against a throng of oncoming dragons. valka is knocked off, but manages to cling to her dragon's neck. as she loses her grip and falls... stoick leaps from skullcrusher and catches valka. he sinks his axe into an icy column, and they slide to a safe landing. drago's bewilderbeast presses closer, sniffing them out. back to hiccup, spotting drago on the battlefield, commanding the bewilderbeast to finish the job.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{stop! stop!}
<A>__{hiccup lands toothless a few paces from drago and brazenly removes his helmet. drago eyes him, incredulous, then begins to chuckle.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{this... is the great dragon master? the son of stoick the vast? what shame he must feel.}
<A>__{toothless snarls, ready to blast, but hiccup calms him with a hand gesture.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{all of this loss, and for what? to become unstoppable? to rule the world?}
<A>__{drago smirks and turns away from hiccup.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{dragons are kind, amazing creatures that can bring people together.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{or tear them apart.}
<A>__{drago laughs mockingly, then removes his false arm, revealing a stump at his shoulder. hiccup is taken aback.}
<C>__{drago }
<D>__{you see, i know what it is to live in fear. to see my village burned, my family taken.}
<A>__{he reattaches the prosthesis, circling hiccup menacingly.}
<C>__{drago }
<D>__{but even as a boy, left with nothing, i vowed to rise above the fear of dragons and liberate the people of this world.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{then why a dragon army?}
<C>__{drago}
<P>__{(grinning, smug)}
<D>__{well, you need dragons to conquer other dragons.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{or maybe you need dragons to conquer people.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{to control those who follow you... and to get rid of those who won't.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{clever boy.}
<A>__{drago grabs his bullhook and re approaches hiccup. toothless readies himself.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{the world wants peace. and we have the answer, back on berk. just let me show you.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{no! let me show you.}
<A>__{drago shrieks madly, summoning the bewilderbeast. toothless circles hiccup, protectively. on the bewilderbeast, about to blast stoick and valka. it hears drago's distant wails, and approaches obediently.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{what...?}
<A>__{stoick follows its stare to the distant battlefield below. he spots hiccup and toothless a few paces from drago.}
<C>__{stoick }
<P>__{(panicked)}
<D>__{hiccup!}
<A>__{he rushes off. valka follows, racing past gobber as he finally joins them, winded from having run up the mountain.}
<C>__{stoick }
<D>__{come on, gobber!}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{okay, change of plans.}
<A>__{he hurries back down the mountain after them.}
<B>__{back to drago}
<A>__{jabbing his bullhook into the ground commandingly. the bewilderbeast flinches and stops, submissive.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{no dragon can resist the alpha's command. so he who controls the alpha, controls them all.}
<A>__{drago points to toothless. the bewilderbeast stares and hisses, forcing toothless to cower under a hypnotic ultrasonic broadcast. toothless struggles against the alpha's command, writhing and grinding his head against the ground.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{toothless? you okay, bud? what's going on?}
<A>__{toothless fights the command, shaking his head in protest. the bewilderbeast insists, with a mesmerizing glare and a low, throaty grumble... until toothless finally succumbs to its control. he raises his head, his stare vacant and robotic, as his pupils turn to slits. drago then points to hiccup. the bewilderbeast responds, hissing again at toothless.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{witness true strength. the strength of will over others. in the face of it, you are nothing.}
<A>__{toothless slowly turns to face hiccup. advancing.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{uh, what did he just tell you?}
<C>__{on stoick}
<A>__{bounding across the ice, pushing himself to make it to hiccup in time.}
<B>__{back on hiccup}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{toothless, what's the matter with you? what're you doing?}
<A>__{hiccup is backed against fallen ice, with toothless advancing mindlessly, and nowhere to run. toothless opens his yawning mouth. gas seeps from his throat.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{knock it off! stop! snap out of it!}
<A>__{stoick barrels through ice formations and over war machines, racing against time.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{toothless! no! toothless! don't!}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{hiccup!}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{stop!}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{son!}
<A>__{hiccup sees stoick about to run into the fray.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{dad! no!}
<A>__{toothless blasts. stoick leaps in front of it, shoving hiccup out of the way and absorbing the blast in the process. he's thrown against the ice with great impact. on valka, hearing the blast, horrified. drago glances back, seeing stoick laying lifeless in the aftermath, pleased by the sudden turn of events. he shuffles off, satisfied. stunned, hiccup comes to and sees stoick in the rubble. he rushes past the still entranced toothless, straining to scatter the ice boulders on top of stoick's body.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{dad!}
<A>__{valka arrives, winded and aghast.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{stoick...}
<A>__{she helps hiccup to turn stoick's body over. valka presses her ear to stoick's heart, confirming his death with a mere glance to hiccup. he tears up, overwhelmed.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{no... you...}
<A>__{gobber, astrid, eret, and the gang arrive, slack jawed. satisfied, the bewilderbeast turns away, releasing toothless of the trance like state. toothless blinks, coming to and confused. he approaches the group, sniffing stoick's hand. hiccup shoves him.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{no! get away from him!}
<A>__{toothless recoils, innocently.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{go on! get out of here! get away!}
<A>__{toothless retreats like a scolded dog, ear plates back and head hung low. valka watches, broken hearted, as hiccup falls upon stoick, inconsolable.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{it's not his fault. you know that.}
<A>__{on the battlefield, the alpha bellows, calling all of the dragons to gather. meatlug, stormfly, hookfang and the others all follow the command as the gang calls after them.}
<D>__{valka (o.s.) (cont'd) good dragons under the control of bad people do bad things.}
<A>__{drago notices toothless tumble down a snow bank, once again slit eyed and entranced, but unable to fly to the alpha without a rider. drago pins him down, eyeing the saddle, pedals, and prosthetic tail. on hiccup and valka in tears as toothless rises into view, with drago in the saddle.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{gather the men and meet at berk!}
<A>__{his soldiers cheer in the thousands.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{toothless!}
<A>__{hiccup tries to go after toothless, but valka holds him back.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{no, don't!}
<A>__{drago jabs his bull hook and points toward the horizon. the alpha bellows, commanding an exodus as it leads the way.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{move out!}
<A>__{hiccup watches, powerless as all dragons take wing and follow.}
