<L>__{17 moving shot on cameron}
<A>__{he slides down a slope on a carpet of fallen leaves, tumbling to the bottom and falls face forward into a running stream where he holds his head and drinks. camera moves across the terrain. there are no pursuers, the forest is silent.}
<L>__{18 close up handcuffs}
<A>__{the jaws of a wire cutter clamp down severing the chain connecting the cuffs around cameron's wrists. he lifts his knee from the cutter handle. his arms are now free. he wedges a chisel against one bracelet and swings a sledgehammer against it. we hear his sharp outcry.}
