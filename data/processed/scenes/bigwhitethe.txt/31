<C>__{gary}
<D>__{like the guy's not gonna end up in a land fill, anyway. you ever ask dave what he did?}
<C>__{jimbo}
<D>__{whatever it was, he told him if he did it again, he'd snap his neck.}
<C>__{gary}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{whoops, he did it again.}
<P>__{(off jimbo not getting it)}
<D>__{the song? from that girl?}
<A>__{no response. gary, humming now, keeps digging, finding nothing.}
<C>__{gary }
<D>__{so how'd it feel? i mean, not when you did it, but, like now?}
<C>__{jimbo}
<D>__{i don't want to talk about it.}

<C>__{jimbo}
<P>__{(walking away)}
<D>__{it was broken.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{i'm just saying... maybe it was like hypothermia and he just looked dead.}
<C>__{jimbo}
