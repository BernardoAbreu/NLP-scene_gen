<A>__{moving with both cars as the buick skids with rear tires locked. reese and terminator fire simultaneously. tight on reese as the doorpost next to his shoulder is torn out by the other's blast. on terminator, leaning to see around his shattered wind shield. too late. he hurtles into the intersection, past the skidding buick. clips the back of the semi. spins radically. vaults the curb in a screeching front end roll. whip panning with the cruiser as it crashes upside down through the counter area of an a & w. low angle as reese and sarah slide to a stop in a cloud of tire smoke. transmission fluid pours out of the car like blood. an instant later they are surrounded by an assortment of lapd, sheriff's dept., and chp cars. the helicopter hovers overhead. medium on sarah and reese, he raises his hands, through the side window, in plain sight. a phalanx of cops, guns drawn, approaches the car warily. sarah looks at reese. then at the cops. she opens the door and runs, staggering, toward them. vukovich steps forward and pulls her away to safety. c.u. reese watching her go as a cop eases his door open.}
