<A>__{nick is half way up the wall, still half asleep, staring at the pistol in disbelief. suddenly he springs, seizes the gun with one hand and slams vince to the floor. vince gets up. nick slugs him in the face, knees him in the stomach and begins pounding his head against the wall. albert lurches over, pulls nick away.}

<A>__{nick looks at him, then he empties the pistol into the floor. for a moment there is absolute silence. the wind moans in the trees, snow curls through the open door and john, who is still soundly sleeping, finds a new note on which to snore. nick looks down at the pistol, turns it over in his hands...}
