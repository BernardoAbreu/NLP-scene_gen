<A>__{a cacophony of birds and insects. swamp maples and willows form a canopy over moss covered mounds and pools of plant choked water. gabriel leads several men, riding along a dry path that snakes through the swamp. they cross a narrow land bridge onto a wooded island, joining a dozen and a half men, including marion who kneels at a campfire. close shot: several of thomas' brightly painted lead soldiers melt in a cast iron pan. the little men fall to their knees then lose form, turning into bubbling, molten metal. the new arrivals dismount and greet the others. gabriel steps up behind marion and watches as he pours the lead into a bullet mold, closes the lid and dips the mold into a bucket of water which hisses and steams.}
