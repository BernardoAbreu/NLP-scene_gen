<L>__{interior barnes and noble day}
<A>__{as she rings up his books, kaufman admires the cashier's flower tattoo. she catches him and smiles with red, wet, pierced lips. she unbuttons her blouse and shows him a breast with a heart tattoo. a sweet heartbeat turns to knocking.}
<L>__{interior empty bedroom night}
<A>__{kaufman, in bed masturbating, looks up at the closed door.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{the door opens. donald stands there for a moment in shadows.}
<C>__{donald}
<D>__{look, you wanna hear my pitch, or what?}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{go away. god damn it.}
<C>__{donald}
<P>__{(lost)}
<D>__{y'know, i'm just trying to do something.}
<A>__{kaufman squints at his brother, sits up, waits.}
<C>__{donald }
<D>__{hey, thanks a lot, man. cool.}
<P>__{(flicks on light, then in pitch mode:)}
<D>__{okay, there's this serial killer, right }
<A>__{kaufman groans, lies down, pulls the covers over his face.}
<C>__{donald }
<D>__{no, wait. see, he's being hunted by a cop. and he's taunting the cop, right? sending clues who his next victim is. he's already holding her hostage in his creepy basement. so the cop gets obsessed with figuring out her identity, and in the process he falls in love with her. even though he's never even met her. she becomes, like, the unattainable, like the holy grail.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<P>__{(through a blanket)}
<D>__{it's a little obvious, don't you think?}
<C>__{donald}
<D>__{okay, but there's a twist. see, we find out the killer suffers from multiple personality disorder. okay? see, he's really also the cop and the girl. all of them. it's all him! isn't that crazy?}
<A>__{donald waits, proud. kaufman pulls off the covers.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{look, the only idea more overused than serial killers, is multiple personality. on top of that you explore the notion that cop and criminal are really two aspects of the same person. see every cop movie ever made for other examples of this.}
<C>__{donald}
<D>__{mom called it psychologically taut.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{the other thing is, there's no way to write this. did you consider that? i mean, how exactly would you show a character holding himself hostage?}
<C>__{donald}
<D>__{trick photography?}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{okay, that's not what i'm asking. what i'm asking is in the reality of this movie, if there's only one character, right?... okay? how could you... what exactly would the scene... how...}
<A>__{donald waits blankly. kaufman gives up, gets out of bed, dresses.}
<C>__{kaufman }
<D>__{i agree with mom. very taut. sybil meets.. i dunno, something very taut.}
<A>__{kaufman exits.}
