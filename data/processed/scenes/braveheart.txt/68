<L>__{exterior the field below stirling castle day}
<A>__{the english army moves forward toward the bridge. it's so narrow that only a single file of riders can move across it at any one time. the english heavy cavalry, two hundred knights, cross uncontested, and form up on the other side.}
<B>__{with wallace and the scots}
<A>__{things look terrible. stephen turns to william.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{the lord tell me he can get me out of this mess. but he's pretty sure you're fooked.}
<B>__{on the english side}
<A>__{talmadge sees the scots doing nothing.}
<C>__{talmadge}
<D>__{amateurs! they do not even contest us! send across the infantry.}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{m'lord, the bridge is so narrow }
<C>__{talmadge}
<D>__{the scots just stand in their formations!}
<A>__{our cavalry will ride them down like grass. get the infantry across so they can finish the slaughter! the english leaders shout orders and keep their men moving across the bridge. talmadge gestures for the attack flag.}
<B>__{the cavalry on the other side of the bridge}
<A>__{the english knights see the signal banners, telling them to attack. they take the lances from their squires, and lower the visors of their helmets. proud, plumed, glimmering; they look invincible. their huge horses, themselves draped in scarlet and purple, look like tanks. the knights charge! their hooves thunder; the horses are so heavy the ground literally shakes with the charge. the scots stand and watch them come on. it's difficult to imagine the courage this takes; from the pov of the scottish lines we see the massive horses boring in... we feel the rising thunder of the charge, closer, closer... wallace moves to the front of the lead group of scots.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{steady! hold... hold... now!}
<A>__{the scots snap their 14 foot spears straight up in unison.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{form!}
<A>__{now the spearmen snap the spears forward in ranks, the first line of men bracing their spears at an angle three feet above the ground, the men behind them bracing theirs at a five foot level, the men behind that bracing at seven feet. the english knights have never seen such a formation. their lances are useless and it's too late to stop! the momentum that was to carry the horses smashing through the men on foot now becomes suicidal force; knights and horses impale themselves on the long spears like beef on skewers.}
<B>__{talmadge}
<A>__{can see it; but worse is the sound, the screams of dying men and horses, carried to him across the battlefield.}
<B>__{wallace and his men}
<A>__{are protected, behind a literal wall of fallen chargers and knights. wallace draws his broadsword and leads his swordsmen out onto the field, attacking the knights that are still alive. most are off their horses; a few have managed to pull up their mounts. wallace and his men are so much more mobile than the knights; the field runs with blood. wallace faces talmadge in the distance.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{here i am, english coward! come get me!!}
<A>__{talmadge is even more enraged and his judgment is gone.}
<C>__{talmadge}
<D>__{press the men across!}
<C>__{cheltham}
<D>__{but m'lord!}
<A>__{talmadge himself gallops forward.}
<C>__{talmadge}
<D>__{press them!}
<A>__{wallace smiles. he grabs hamish.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{tell mornay to ride to the flank and cross upstream. wait! tell him to be sure the english see him ride away!}
<A>__{hamish hurries off with the message. the english infantry keeps moving across the little bridge. the scottish nobles watch from their positions on horseback. they have a few dozen mounted riders, none heavily armored.}
<C>__{lochlan}
<D>__{if he waits much longer }
<A>__{hamish hurries up.}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{ride around and ford behind them!}
<C>__{mornay}
<D>__{we should not divide our forces!}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{wallace says do it! and he says for you to let the english see you!}
<C>__{mornay}
<P>__{(understanding)}
<D>__{they shall think we run away.}
<A>__{mornay leads his riders away.}
<B>__{lord talmadge}
<A>__{sees the scottish nobles ride off, and shouts to cheltham...}
<C>__{talmadge}
<D>__{see! every scot with a horse is fleeing! hurry! hurry!}
<A>__{he drives half his army across the river.}
<B>__{wallace}
<A>__{lifts his sword.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{for scotland!}
<A>__{he charges down the hill... the fight at stirling bridge various shots the scots follow wallace on foot, charging into the english. the english leaders are stunned by the ferocious attack.}
<C>__{talmadge}
<D>__{press reinforcements across!}
<A>__{the english leaders try to herd more of their footsoldiers onto the bridge, which only hams them up. meanwhile, on the other side of the bridge, wallace and his charging men slam into the english infantry with wild fury. the english fall back on each other, further blocking the bridge.}
<B>__{up on the hilltop}
<A>__{the nobles look back with grudging admiration.}
<C>__{mornay}
<D>__{he's taking the bloody bridge! the english can't get across! he's evened the odds at one stroke!}
<A>__{with rising desire to join the bandwagon, the nobles spur... down on the plain, wallace and the attacking men drive the english back, killing as they go. the scots reach the bridge itself. the waters below it run red with blood. talmadge has begun to panic.}
<C>__{talmadge}
<D>__{use the archers!}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{they're too close, we'll shoot out own men!}
<B>__{on the bridge}
<A>__{the scots are carving their way through the english soldiers; nothing can stop them. wallace is relentless; each time he swings, a head flies, or an arm. hamish and stephen fight beside him, swinging the broadsword with both hands. old campbell loses his shield in the grappling; an english swordsman whacks at him and takes off his left hand, but campbell batters him to the ground with his right, and stabs him. reaching the english side of the bridge, the scots begin to build a barrier with the dead bodies. the english are not without courage. cheltham leads a desperate counterattack. the scots make an impenetrable barrier of slashing blades. still cheltham keeps coming; wallace hits him with a vertical slash that parts his helmet, his hair, and his brain. talmadge has seen enough; he gallops away. the remaining english general tries to save the army.}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{we are still five thousand! rally!}
<A>__{the english try to form up; but the scottish horsemen, fording the river high upstream, come crashing into the english flank and ride over the surprised english infantry. at the bridge, wallace sees the scottish nobles attacking. the english soldiers are in utter panic, running and being cut down on all sides. and the scottish soldiers taste something scots have not tasted for a hundred years: victory. even while finishing off the last of the english soldiers, they begin their highlow chant... even the noblemen take up the chant! wallace looks around at the aftermath of the battle: bodies on the field; soldiers lying impaled; stacks of bodies on the bridge; the bridge slick with blood. before it can all sink in, william is lifted on the shoulders of his men.}
<C>__{scottish soldiers}
<D>__{wal lace! wal lace! wal lace!}
