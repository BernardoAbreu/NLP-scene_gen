<L>__{interior sanatorium, white room afternoon}
<A>__{a polaroid is on a white table. it is the photo wild bill gave to mills and somerset. it is a picture of a belt, made with extra leather straps so it can be worn securely around the groin. it is a strap on phallus, but there is no plastic protuberance. instead, there is a metal knife. it is a strap on butcher's knife. somerset is seated beside the white table in this white room. mills stands behind him. the crazed man from the lust murder is in a chair across the room. the crazed man is crying.}

<C>__{crazed man }
<D>__{the gun was in my throat.}
