<A>__{it's another beautiful fall afternoon and cars are entering the stadium parking lot. at one of the entrances, the striking redskins are picketing. jerome lindell (nfl players president) is still marching with them. a little boy stops one of the redskins and asks for an autograph on a program. the player gives it to him and the kid walks away. lindell runs after the kid, grabs the program and rips off the page the player signed.}
