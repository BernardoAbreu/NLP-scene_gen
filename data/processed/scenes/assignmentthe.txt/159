<A>__{a taxi pulls up in front of ramirez's house. ramirez steps out of the taxi dressed in his navy uniform and carrying his sea bag. he does not have a hat on and we see his head while not bald, is now in the shortest of buzz cuts, certainly much shorter than the way his wife last saw him. he stands outside the house looking at it like an adult who has come back to his boyhood home and finds it suddenly so small. just then the door opens. there is maura holding the baby and next to her, joey. ramirez runs toward them and they to him and we see them in tableaux, embracing. an idyllic family reunited.}
