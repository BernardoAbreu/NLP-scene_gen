<L>__{exterior bank various angles night}
<A>__{the restless crowd stirs, sensing something happening. turning to see something coming.}
<B>__{apartment fire escape}
<A>__{the cops gear up their weapons: radios crackle. something, a vehicle, is moving through the crowd, cops shoving people aside to let it through. the old lady pays no attention. she is down to one of the very last pieces of the puzzle and is searching for the spot for it.}
<B>__{low angle in clear place in front of bank}
<A>__{as the vehicle clears the crowd and slowly draws up in front. it is a long airport limousine of the type with many doors. it stops. everyone's attention is on it. a black driver gets out, a gay afro knit on his head, coke dealer's shades, for the cognoscenti, one very long little finger nail, a nifty van dyke style beard and one gold front tooth. he looks around, holding a sheet of paper. sheldon, others, approach. they are looking into the vehicles, opening doors, checking tires, etc.}
<B>__{door of bank}
<A>__{sonny appears. he strides to the limo.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{okay. get away from it.}
<A>__{after a moment the cops all move back. sonny opens the front door and begins to check it out. the driver starts to move away...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{these seats come out?}
