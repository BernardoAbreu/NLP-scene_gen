<A>__{screeech! gru's car pulls out of the driveway and speeds down the mountain, just as lucy's hang glider lands at eduardo's.}
<L>__{ext: eduardo's house day}
<A>__{lucy looks around, but doesn't see gru. she maneuvers her way through the crowd.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{oops, sorry!}
<A>__{she makes it through, but still no sign of gru. suddenly pollito appears and exchanges looks with lucy. he screeches and flies towards her. she strikes a martial arts pose ready to defend herself. as she does, her purse falls to the ground. the attack never comes and she looks down to see pollito pecking at her purse.}
<C>__{el macho }
<D>__{pollito! what's the matter?}
<A>__{el macho appears and picks up the chicken, petting it.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{oh, hey! eduardo!}
<C>__{el macho}
<D>__{lucia! i apologize. pollito, he's usually not like this. the same thing happened the other day with... with gru and...}
<A>__{el macho drops off, deep in thought. connecting the dots. lucy is oblivious.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{oh, speaking of gru...uh, have you seen him? i really need to talk to him.}
<C>__{el macho}
<D>__{yes, i think he's somewhere around here. you two are close, no?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{oh, i don't know. i mean close... i wouldn't say we were close. why, did he say we were close? did he say that?}
<C>__{el macho}
<D>__{it's more what he didn't say. for instance, he never mentioned...that you were both working for the anti villain league!!!}
<A>__{suddenly el macho turns pollito around revealing that he has her avl credentials in his beak. el macho grabs lucy.}
<C>__{el macho }
<P>__{(threateningly)}
<D>__{you're coming with me.}
<A>__{he leads her away.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{we see dr. nefario watching this, in shock. he's holding a drink and a mexican flag cupcake.}
