<L>__{exterior boat deck, starboard side}
<A>__{murdoch, at collapsible a, is no longer in control. the crowd is threatening to rush the boat. they push and jostle, yelling and shouting at the officers. the pressure from behind pushes them forward, and one guy falls off the edge of the deck into the water less than ten feet below.}
<C>__{tommy}
<A>__{give us a chance to live, you limey bastards! murdoch fires his webley twice in the air, then point it at the crowd.}
<C>__{murdoch}
<A>__{i will shoot any man who tries to get past me. cal steps up to him.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{we had a deal, damn you. murdoch pushes him back, pointing the pistol at cal.}
<C>__{murdoch}
<A>__{get back! a man next to tommy rushes forward, and tommy is shoved from behind. murdoch shoots the first man, and seeing tommy coming forward, puts a bullet into his chest. tommy collapses, and fabrizio grabs him, holding him in his arms as his life flows out over the deck. murdoch turns to his men and salutes smartly. then he puts the pistol to his temple and... blam! he drops like a puppet with the strings cut and topples over the edge of the boat deck into the water only a few feet below. cal stares in horror at murdoch's body bobbing in the black water. the money floats out of the pocket of his greatcoat, the bills spreading across the surface. the crew rush to get the last few women aboart the boat.}

<P>__{(calling above the confusion)}
<A>__{any more women or children?! the child crying in the alcove. cal scoops her up and runs forward, cradling her in his arms.}
<C>__{cal}
<P>__{(forcing his way through the crowd)}
<A>__{here's a child! i've got a child!}
<C>__{cal }
<P>__{(to mcelroy)}
<A>__{please... i'm all she has in the world. mcelroy nods curtly and pushes him into the boat. he spins with his gun, brandishing it in the air to keep the other men back. cal gets into the boat, holding the little girl. he takes a seat with the women.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{there, there.}
