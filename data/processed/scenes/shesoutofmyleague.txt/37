<A>__{he pours a glass of water. he's about to return when he sees his reflection in the window. the boner under his khakis is not subtle. he looks down and starts to panic.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{um... you want anything to eat?}
<C>__{molly }
<D>__{no thanks.}
<A>__{kirk opens the fridge and thrusts his pelvis in. he takes a few deep, calming breaths. he closes the fridge still at full alert. kirk searches the kitchen, his panic building. he grabs a time magazine. he flips through frantically. he turns to a bikini model in an ad, then a naked aboriginal women, then bare breasts in a breast cancer article.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh come on!}
<A>__{he is sweating like crazy.}
<C>__{molly }
<D>__{can i give you a hand?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no. i got it!}
<A>__{kirk finally flips to a picture of barbara bush. he stares at it hard. his boner begins to retreat.}
