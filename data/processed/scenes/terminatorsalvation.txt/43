<A>__{the aerostat zips past the carport. as soon as its gone }
<C>__{star}
<D>__{now!}
<A>__{the jeep is suddenly pushed from the carport, tires somewhat inflated. marcus is on one side of the rear, kyle on the other, star behind the wheel, the seat moved all the way up. they get the vehicle to a slight slope, it begins to roll on its own.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{pop the clutch! let your foot up!}
<B>__{angle in jeep}
<A>__{we see it's been hot wired. star has her foot all the way down on the clutch, now lets up the jeep bucks and sputters... but catches. as soon as it does, music blares from the tape deck raucous heavy metal, the aged cassette speeds and slows. marcus runs for the driver's side, but the jeep is pulling ahead fast.}
<B>__{angle in jeep}
<A>__{star is staring at the speaker, mesmerized at the sound of the music. when she looks out the windshield she's about to hit a wall, squeals in terror marcus vaults in and pushes her aside, squeezing behind the wheel, hitting the brakes and throwing the jeep into neutral.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{aerostat's coming!}
<A>__{kyle hops in back as marcus adjusts the seat and floors it. the kids are exhilarated as marcus zooms out of there, heading off road across the plains, lights off, music loud.}
<C>__{star}
<D>__{music...}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{sort of.}
<A>__{marcus turns the music down. he looks up to see the aerostat, right over their heads, keeping pace with the vehicle, red lights flashing. kyle rises in back, swings at it with the shotgun butt the aerostat deftly dodges the blows.}
<C>__{star}
<D>__{oh no! it's gonna call a harvester, we're dead }
<A>__{marcus slams on the brakes the aerostat stops a few feet ahead of them, hovering in the air. marcus picks up an x shaped lug wrench from behind his seat, rises, taking aim and hurls the wrench with amazing speed and power it flies like a throwing star and smashes the aerostat to bits in a shower of sparks and metal. the three of them stare breathlessly for a moment.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{wow. you're good.}
<A>__{marcus flexes his hand, startled at his own strength.}
