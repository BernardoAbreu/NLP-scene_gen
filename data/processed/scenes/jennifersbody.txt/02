<D>__{welcome to the mental olympics. they're big on recreation here. supposedly it helps us vent our aggressions. we've traded in our hatchets for rackets, our drain o bombs for double dutch.}

<D>__{even the cutters get in on the action when they're fully conscious.}
<A>__{we see a girl swinging a jump rope who has a ladder of fresh bandages on her arms and legs.}

<D>__{me? i'm just trying to stay invisible.}
