<L>__{interior horizon savings & loan day}
<A>__{the bank is busy with the lunch hour crowd. taking his place in line, edward fills out a deposit slip. as the line snakes around through the ropes, the man in front of him gets a look at edward.}
<C>__{the man}
<D>__{edward? edward bloom?}
<A>__{the man is none other than...}
<C>__{norther winslow}
<D>__{it's me. norther winslow.}
<C>__{edward }
<D>__{i was astonished to see the greatest poet of both ashton and spectre all the way out in texas.}
<A>__{the men shake, disbelieving this lucky coincidence.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i don't believe it!}
<C>__{norther winslow}
<D>__{i want you to know, when you left spectre it opened my eyes. there was a whole life out there that i was not living. so i travelled. i saw france, and africa, half of south america. every day a new adventure, that's my motto.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{that's great, norther. i'm happy for you. i can't believe i helped.}
<A>__{he's genuinely proud.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{so what are you up to now?}
<C>__{norther winslow}
<D>__{i'm robbing this place.}
<A>__{reaching the front of the line, norther pulls two pistols out of his coat, firing both into the ceiling. screams all around. the skinny security guard makes a halfhearted reach for his gun, but norther waves him off. the guard takes out his gun and slides it over.}
<C>__{norther winslow}
<P>__{(to edward)}
<D>__{would you mind grabbing that?}
<A>__{there's nothing threatening about his delivery he might as well be asking for a budweiser. still, edward senses it would be best to do as he says. he takes the guard's gun.}
<C>__{norther winslow}
<P>__{(to the crowd)}
<D>__{now, i want all of you to lie down. i'm gonna be cleaning out the cash drawers, and my associate here is going to handle the vault.}
<P>__{(pointing to a teller woman)}
<D>__{you help my friend, okay?}
<A>__{the teller woman nods. angle on edward, not sure what to do. he has a gun, but he truly doesn't want to shoot norther. the teller woman is already waving him to the back. he decides he better go.}
