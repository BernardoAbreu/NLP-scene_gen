<A>__{she's nodding off now, barely able to keep her eyes open in the warm, close boredom of the classroom.}
<C>__{surfer }
<D>__{in the most high and palmy state of rome, a little ere the mightiest julius fell...}
<P>__{(nancy's head pitches}
<D>__{forward; she jerks it}
<P>__{back up, barely awake)}
<D>__{the graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman street...}
<A>__{nancy's head has sunk again, eyelids drawn as if by enormous weight. by the time her cheek's against the desk, the surfer's voice is echoed and distant. but another voice, tina's, is very near, very much present. a sad, thin plainterior}
<C>__{tina }
<D>__{nancy.}
<A>__{nancy gives a start. her eyes lock onto something. reverse. tilted sideways, in her head's pov, we look straight out through the open doorway of the classroom into the hall. there, standing in a black pool of fluid, is a full sized rubber body bag. dark red and yellow. weaving slightly, the merest suggesting of movement within it. back on nancy, sitting upright, wiping the sleep from her eyes, shaking her head like a punchy prozefighter. she looks back out the door. reverse in 'normal' pov the hallway is empty. but there's a dark smear on its floor tiles. nancy looks nervously towards the rest of the class. no one else has noticed a thing outside the door. all are dumbly spellbound by the surfer, who now recites like a deep voiced robot, his face wreathed by white hair.}
<C>__{surfer}
<D>__{o god, i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that i have bad dreams...}
<A>__{angle back on nancy. she slips from her seat, eye warily on the teacher and class. but no one turns as she disappears through the doorway.}
