<L>__{interior leeds dressing room day (1974)}
<A>__{the leeds players trudge in, after the game. angry. heads hung low. begin to strip off. caption: "qpr 1, leeds 0." clough enters. visibly gutted by the result, but now's not the time to show it..}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{sorry, lads.}
<A>__{clough walks round the dressing room, shaking hands individually, patting players on the back...}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{you were robbed out there today. broad bloody daylight. that was never a penalty.}
<A>__{clough's tone is sensitive. tactful. considerate.}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{stan bowles? diving like that? man's a disgrace..}
<A>__{but several of the leeds players refuse his hand. or freeze at his touch. turn away from him..}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{i've spoken to the referee already. given him a piece of my mind. and come monday morning, mark my word, i shall be taking this further...}
<A>__{the leeds players stare at one another. shoot one another looks.}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{anyway, i want you all to know, i'm not in the slightest bit critical of your performance today. not a bit of it. you were terrific out there...}
<A>__{norman hunter spits in contempt. giles turns and walks out, into the showers.}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{i couldn't ask for more effort. commitment.}
<P>__{(tailing off)}
<D>__{passion.}
<A>__{the leeds players follow. finally o'hare and mcgovern, too. a deathly silence. clough is left alone in the dressing room. over this: the sound of a ringing telephone. a gruff voice answers..}
