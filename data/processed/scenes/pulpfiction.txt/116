<L>__{interior kitchen morning}
<A>__{jimmie hands the wolf a cup of coffee.}
<C>__{the wolf}
<D>__{thank you, jimmie.}
<A>__{he takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the three men the plan of action.}
<C>__{the wolf}
<D>__{okay first thing, you two.}
<P>__{(meaning jules and vincent)}
<D>__{take the body, stick it in the trunk. now jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house. that would lead me to believe that in the garage or under the sink, you got a bunch of cleansers and cleaners and shit like that, am i correct?}
<C>__{jimmie}
<D>__{yeah. exactly. under the sink.}
<C>__{the wolf}
<D>__{good. what i need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products and clean the inside of the car. and i'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. you need to go in the backseat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull. get it out of there. wipe down the upholstery now when it comes to upholstery, it don't need to be spic and span, you don't need to eat off it. give it a good once over. what you need to take care of are the really messy parts. the pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up. but the windows are a different story. them you really clean. get the windex, do a good job. now jimmie, we need to raid your linen closet. i need blankets, i need comforters, i need quilts, i need bedspreads. the thicker the better, the darker the better. no whites, can't use 'em. we need to camouflage the interior of the car. we're gonna line the front seat and the backseat and the floor boards with quilts and blankets. if a cop stops us and starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last. but at a glance, the car will appear to be normal. jimmie lead the way, boys get to work.}
<A>__{the wolf and jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving vincent and jules standing in the kitchen.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(calling after him)}
<D>__{a "please" would be nice.}
<A>__{the wolf stops and turns around.}
<C>__{the wolf}
<D>__{come again?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i said a "please" would be nice.}
<A>__{the wolf takes a step toward him.}
<C>__{the wolf}
<D>__{set is straight, buster. i'm not here to say "please."i'm here to tell you want to do. and if self preservation is an instinct you possess, you better fuckin' do it and do it quick. i'm here to help. if my help's not appreciated, lotsa luck gentlemen.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{it ain't that way, mr. wolf. your help is definitely appreciated.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i don't mean any disrespect. i just don't like people barkin' orders at me.}
<C>__{the wolf}
<D>__{if i'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor. i think fast, i talk fast, and i need you guys to act fast if you want to get out of this. so pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car.}
