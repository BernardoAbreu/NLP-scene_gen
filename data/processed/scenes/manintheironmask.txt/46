<L>__{exterior french coast night}
<A>__{lying just off the coast is the forbidden island, where the imposing fortress prison rises on the promontory off shore.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{the prison of belle sur.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{come, we have a boat waiting.}
<A>__{as hooded jesuits appear from the shadows to guide them, athos and porthos glance at each other; porthos shrugs.}
<L>__{exterior among rocks at the beach night}
<A>__{the guides lead the musketeers down a hilly path to a long boat, hidden among the large rocks that dot the coast. sitting next to the boat is a scrawny little man in priest's garb; at his feet is a long narrow bundle, about the size of a mummy, with a rope tied at either end. the guides drag the boat across the sand into the surf. aramis throws off his cape, and strips down almost naked. he's still fit and hard. with the guides helping him, he lifts the bundle by its ropes and ties it around his waist.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{a body.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{i see that is a body! but where did you get it?}
<A>__{aramis ignores the question, and the guides dress him in priest's garb. with the robes spreading over the big bundle added artfully to aramis' waist, it appears he is a very fat priest; the wig and false beard the assistants give him adds to the illusion of aramis as a wild, reclusive monk. the sun is beginning to come up over the mountains.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{he gets one day of confession each year. today is the day.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{who does?}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{best not to ask. shouldn't even talk about it.}
<A>__{aramis steps onto the boat. the little priest who first joined them gets in too, along with a couple of rowers.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{what do we do now?}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{i don't know about you, but i plan to wait here.}
<A>__{the rowers pull the boat toward the fortress prison.}
