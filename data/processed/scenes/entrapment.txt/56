<L>__{exterior freighter deck night}
<A>__{expansive barely lit deck under a canopy of stars. a silver haired couple in immaculate evening attire stroll alone, he is humming to barely audible dance music from a distant lounge. she clings to his arm, it is romantic. until they reach the railing where he turns, and says something quietly in german... she stiffens. pulls her arm away from his. she sneers coldly, calls him a name in german, and he unloads on her, a barrage of german language invective that would melt a tank. she absorbs the abuse without flinching, turns toward the rail, hawks and... ...spits over the side. strides away from him. he watches her go. then... ...spits over the side himself. and follows her. half a beat. mac's head appears above the rail. just where they spit. not a mark on him.}
