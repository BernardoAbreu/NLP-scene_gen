<C>__{kate}
<D>__{eyes shine when she talks about... science. raises her voice when she knows she's wrong. bossy, bossy, bossy. lose my train of thought when i see her smile. most beautiful when she's angry. honorable heart... peasant feet.}
<A>__{the front door is heard slamming. kate, alarmed, stuffs the notebook back in leopold's pocket. she races to the door; glances back at the notebook, turns off the light and scurries from the room.}
