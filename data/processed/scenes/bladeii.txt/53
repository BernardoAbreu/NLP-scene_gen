<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{whistler}
<A>__{hefting a heavy ordnance case on the table. blade and company sit on one side, the bloodpack on the other.}
<C>__{whistler}
<P>__{(opening a case of bullets)}
<D>__{glaser safety rounds in .38, .45, and 9mm caliber. foil capsules at the tip filled with silver nitrate grains. they pack a major kinetic energy dump. and since you suckheads don't like sunlight, we've modified the entry lights with uv filters }
<A>__{whistler flicks on the entry light. then notices that chupa isn't paying attention. the vampire is looking at snowman who is saying something in sign language. chupa snickers. whistler picks up a massive gun with a modified c mag (hundred round cylindrical mag). it has a strange electromag assembly barrel with shockwave ports running along it.}
<C>__{whistler }
<D>__{this puppy here? hyper velocity railgun. spits up silver tipped iron core needles at six thousand butt humping feet per second. like this }
<A>__{whistler fires ba bang! a sonic boom rocks the workshop, shattering a number of windows and computer monitor screens as a wad of needle rushes just millimeters past chupa's face, embedding in the wall behind him.}
<C>__{chupa}
<D>__{hey, hey! the fuck you doing?!}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{getting your attention, paco.}
<C>__{chupa}
<D>__{well you've got it, warmblood. now what the fuck are you gonna do with it?}
<A>__{blade clears his throat and stands.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{if you girls are finished flirting, i'd like to get started.}
<B>__{moments later}
<A>__{blade, whistler, and the bloodpack are silently suiting up for war strapping on body armor, securing stakes and knives, clicking ammo cartridges into their various weapons. we see them lacing up combat boots, checking rifle sights, entry lights. blade dons one of his edta pneumatic gauntlets. whistler loads custom rounds into a shotgun. then he reaches to clip on an ammo vest. but his hands are shaking slightly and he can't seem to clip the locking mechanism together. after a beat, blade reaches over and does it for whistler. like a son helping his father. a beat passes between them, whistler and blade looking at one another. then whistler nods, satisfied. as blade crosses towards asad and nyssa, he stops by verlaine, sizing her up.}
<C>__{blade }
<D>__{didn't i kill you already?}
<C>__{verlaine}
<P>__{(cold)}
<D>__{that was my sister.}
<A>__{beat. blade smiles coldly.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{this the part where you beat your chest and vow revenge?}
<C>__{verlaine}
<D>__{something like that.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{save it for the director's cut.}
<A>__{blade moves on, stopping before nyssa.}
<C>__{blade }
<D>__{where to first?}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{the house of pain.}
