<L>__{interior henry's apartment night}
<A>__{moments later. simon arrives with a six pack and finds henry sitting in front of the fire, staring into the flames, brooding darkly.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i was caught. yes, i was caught... once. i was caught in flagranti delicto screwing a thirteen year old girl named susan. she was an ugly and mean spirited kid, but she knew how to play upon my weaknesses which, i admit, are deep and many.}
<A>__{he drinks, then looks at simon and adds...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{you appear shocked.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(he is)}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{henry stands and leans over the fire.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{it was a pathetic little conspiracy. a transparently desperate attempt to discredit me and my ideas; to label me a mere pedophile. as if i'd be ashamed of such a thing. as if socrates himself hadn't been taken out of circulation for corrupting the youth of athens!}
<A>__{he comes over and takes a beer. he strides around the room, thinking, reflecting.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{seven years. seven years for one afternoon of blissful transgression. but what of it? who cares? prison's not so bad; particularly if one's a sex offender, free from the popular and conventional horror of sodomy.}
<A>__{stops, drinks declares...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{they were not 'lost years'.}
<A>__{he approaches the notebooks lined up on the mantelpiece.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i put them to good use. i began my major work. my opus.}
<A>__{he glances over at simon, who sits gripping his beer, watching, rapt.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{believe me, simon, this incident with the girl, prison... it pales to insignificance in the wider context of my career.}
<A>__{he pauses and swills back some beer. he brightens up, gets excited...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{nothing in comparison to the day my 'confession' is unleashed.}
<P>__{(beginning to pace)}
<D>__{what an orgy we'll have then, huh? what shouts of outrage from the offended populace, from the sanctimonious purveyors of culture and quality, the righteous defenders of what ever inane and haphazard notion of progress then in vogue. they'll be beside themselves with fiercely reasoned critical analysis. apoplectic with indignation!}
<A>__{drinks sloppily, burps, wipes his mouth with his arm.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{their feelings will be hurt.}
<A>__{he smashes the bottle in the fireplace.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{yes, like a mirror which reflects only the inside of the person before it, my 'confession' will lovingly render humanity's common monstrosity in all of its lurid wide screen glory.}
<A>__{he grabs a new beer and twists off its cap.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{why should i blush or feel shame before the common lot of humanity, anyway, for a few banal and, again i admit, inelegant transgressions?}
<A>__{he drinks, sighs and sits back down.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{after all, really, i'm doing civilization a favor.}
<A>__{simon sits back in awe. he waits a moment and thinks. finally he stands and approaches the 'confession'. he reaches out and drags his hand across the notebooks.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{when can i read it?}
<A>__{henry sits staring into the flames again. he pauses, then...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{soon.}
