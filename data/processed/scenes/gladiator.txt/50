<L>__{exterior provincial arena dugout day}
<A>__{in the cramped holding area of the arena, a dugout beneath the stands, maximus and the other gladiators are waiting. proximo walks before them, giving a final "pep talk." he gazes at them evenly, his eyes going from face to face.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{some of you say you can't fight, you won't fight... they all say that... but one day you will pick up a sword and thrust it into another man. and the crowd will cheer you and love you. and you will love them for it. on that day... you will be a gladiator.}
<A>__{he stops at maximus.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{in this life, we all die. all we can choose is how we die. and how we are remembered. be remembered proudly.}
<A>__{drums are heard from the arena. proximo nods to a waiting blacksmith. the blacksmith begins slamming shackles on the gladiator's wrists chaining them together in teams of two by a chain about four feet long. the blacksmith is about to chain maximus to the scribe.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{no...}
<P>__{(he points to juba)}
<D>__{... give the spaniard to him. give the scribe to vibius.}
<A>__{proximo nods to vibius, who, for reasons we shall soon see, makes no protest to being chained to the whimpering scribe. proximo watches the blacksmith shackle maximus and juba together and then strides off.}
<C>__{juba}
<P>__{(to maximus)}
<D>__{are we going to fight each other?}
