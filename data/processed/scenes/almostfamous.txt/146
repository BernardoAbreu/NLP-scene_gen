<L>__{exterior concord pavillion backstage early morning}
<A>__{william exits a backstage portosan. penny catches him by the grilling area where catering is preparing for the outdoor event. their laminated passes swing from around their necks. thuding in the distance, stillwater plays for a cheering outdoor crowd. the sound of summer insects in the air.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{so it wasn't a birthday party, it was a farewell.}
<A>__{william doesn't answer. he looks at her, blowing some hair out of her face.}
<C>__{penny }
<D>__{you think you can fool me. i read you. i know what you're thinking.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{penny}
<P>__{(touched)}
<D>__{you're worried about me and russell.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yeah. i gotta work on that.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{you're so sweet. god if there was more of you in him...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{don't tell me this stuff. i want to like him.}
<C>__{penny}
<P>__{(concerned for him)}
<D>__{did you miss your test or something?}
<A>__{he shakes his head. it's so beyond a test.}
<C>__{penny }
<D>__{i know i'm not on the plane, and i'm not going on some other band's bus.}
<C>__{i}
<D>__{mean, i could go with the sabbath road crew, but that would be pathetic. the girls are all going with humble pie. if you could find out from russell }
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{penny }
<C>__{penny}
<P>__{(a decision)}
<D>__{forget it. i'm flying to new york myself. i have a bunch of partial tickets. i know his ex wife, current girlfriend's going to be there }
<A>__{william's eyebrows rise. she examines his face for clues.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{ i'm not sure that's a good idea.}
<C>__{penny}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{what? what are you saying? what do you know? did russell say something?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i don't know anything.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{i know he wants me there. he gave me a cake. he wrote me that sweet poem.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(loud)}
<D>__{wake up! don't go to new york!}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{what are you telling me?}
<A>__{she looks so achingly beautiful to him.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{because you're not who you said you were! i thought you were retired!}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{you're right. i'm not who i said i was. i'm just like you. i love music, so this is my family. some people like tractors, and they hang out with tractor people.}
<A>__{what's the worst that}
<D>__{could happen if i go to new york?}
<P>__{(little girl)}
<D>__{"i get my little heart broken?"}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{oh no. never you!}
<A>__{you eat people alive! she tears some leaves off a tree. he looks at her, unable to formulate a response.}
<C>__{penny}
<P>__{(accusatory)}
<D>__{i'm sorry i told you so much. you have some way of making everybody tell you all their secrets.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{that's a good one. tell me too much and make it my fault.}
<A>__{he continues walking, she follows. they have ventured outside the backstage area, onto adjoining boston farmland. the show booms in the background.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{come on. you've seen what's happened. russell and i fell in love. how much, i don't know... but this is the first time i've fallen for someone, really fallen... since iggy, and i'm not happy about it.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you slept with iggy pop!?}
<A>__{she says nothing.}
<C>__{william }
<P>__{(sputtering)}
<D>__{why don't you just tell me now, who else so when i go to the record store, i know who to be jealous of. because right now, it's looking like the whole store!}
<A>__{he's upset. she stares at him.}
<C>__{penny}
<P>__{(teasing, defiant)}
<D>__{you'll remember me forever. i was there when you lost your virginity.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(upset at the memory)}
<D>__{so was steely dan! it was a crowded room.}
<A>__{she laughs, can't help it. then:}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{you make me laugh. i think i'm gonna cry.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i thought we were going to morocco! there's no morocco. there's never been a morocco. there's not even a penny lane. i don't even know your real name.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{if i ever met a guy in the real world, who looked at me the way you just looked at me...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{when and where does the real world occur? i am really... confused here. fuck! all these rules and all these sayings... and nicknames...}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{you know you're too sweet for rock and roll.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{where do you get off... where do you get "sweet?" i'm not sweet. i'm dark and mysterious and pissed off and i could be very dangerous to all of you... i'm not sweet, and you should know that about me! i am the enemy.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{you're not any of those things and that's what i love about you.}
<A>__{william stands there in disbelief, unable to look at her.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{you fall in love to keep from falling in love.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{i don't want to go home!}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{well, i have to go home. and you never helped me.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{yes i did.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{that disc jockey in arizona got a better interview than me... and he was asleep.}
<A>__{he starts walking back to the stage. she follows. they are two very young kids thrashed by the seas of rock and roll. his frustration increases. she just doesn't get it. applause in b.g. she grabs his shirt.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{look. you should be happy for me. you don't know what he says to me in private. maybe it is love. as much as it can be with someone who }
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(blurts)}
<D>__{ sold you to humble pie for fifty dollars and a case of beer? i was there!}
<A>__{he is instantly sorry. her world privately crumbles, but she tries to remain stoic and carefree.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{what kind of beer?}
