<L>__{interior small television studio night}
<A>__{buddy felton waits alone. a camera crew watches him. he is well dressed, exceedingly nervous. he summons the courage to ask a question.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{could i see how i photograph?}
<C>__{camerawoman}
<D>__{huh? sorry?}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{'cause for the interview they're going to use a screen and disguise me to protect my anonymity so could i see myself before that?}
<C>__{camerawoman}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{the camerawoman punches a button and immediately buddy's image comes up on a standing monitor on the studio floor. he's not happy with the image but works at concealing his reaction gasping a bit of air trying to touch it. aaron enters. tom smiles a friendly smile which flusters buddy momentarily. but again he almost manages to conceal his private rush. buddy's internal drama is such he invariably finds himself covering up, fearful roomfuls of people will simultaneously guess his thoughts. aaron directs him behind a screen and looks at his notes.}
