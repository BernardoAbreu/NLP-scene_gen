<L>__{int hazel's car later}
<A>__{gus is in the passenger's seat. isaac sits in the back. hazel returns to the car. with a carton of eggs.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{ok now what?}
<A>__{gus smiles. cut to:}
<L>__{ext suburban street moments later}
<A>__{hazel, gus, and isaac lean against hazel's car staring something down.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{is it there?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{oh it's there.}
<A>__{reveal they're looking at monica's green firebird.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{she's in the house?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{who cares where she is? this is not about her. this is about you.}
<P>__{(sticks out his hand)}
<D>__{hazel...}
<A>__{hazel nods, opens the egg carton, hands gus an egg. gus puts it in isaac's hands. positions isaac who, of course, can't see a thing towards the firebird. isaac winds up and tosses the egg. it misses the car by a mile. after a beat:}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{i didn't hear anything.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{a little to the left.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{my throw was to the left or i should aim to the left?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{aim left.}
<A>__{isaac turns his shoulders.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{lefter.}
<A>__{isaac turns some more.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{yes! excellent! and throw hard.}
<A>__{gus hands him a second egg. isaac winds up and hurls it missing the car again but hitting the house.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{bullseye!}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{no you missed it by like 20 feet.}
<P>__{(hands him a third)}
<D>__{try one more time.}
<A>__{isaac hurls it, this time smashing the car's taillight. isaac's face lights up.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{woo hoo!}
<A>__{isaac grabs for another egg. throws it. then another. he's a throwing machine. most of them miss but at least he's enjoying himself. finally there's a direct hit on the car door, triggering the alarm. isaac pauses.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{keep throwing, keep throwing!}
<A>__{isaac does. gus smiles, putting an unlit cigarette in his mouth. hazel watches him, enjoying this moment. eventually, monica's mom opens the front door and comes out.}
<C>__{monica's mom}
<D>__{what in god's name }
<A>__{seeing hazel, gus, and isaac, she stops in her tracks.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{are you monica's mom?}
<C>__{monica's mom}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{hello ma'am. your daughter has done an injustice and we've come here seeking revenge. we may not look like much. between the three of us, we have five legs, four eyes, and two and a half working lungs.}
<C>__{gus }
<D>__{but we also have two dozen eggs. so if i was you, i would go back inside.}
<A>__{monica's mom is very confused. a beat. without another word, she turns and goes back inside. the three of them celebrate. as isaac picks up where he left off, hazel gently kisses gus on the cheek. and over we hear:}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{a few days later, gus landed in the hospital with chest pains.}
