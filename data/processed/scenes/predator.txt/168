<L>__{interior schaefer night}
<A>__{creeping forward, carefully placing one foot in front of the other, suddenly stops, hearing the click scrape, click scrape, now on his right. starting to move in this new direction, he stops again, hearing the sound now directly across from him. listening, he hears the sound again from yet another direction, the sound echoing in the natural ampitheater of rock. schaefer, uncertain of where to turn, waits. suddenly he crouches and freezes, hearing the unbelievable sound of a human voice, softly echoing through the ampitheater.}
<C>__{anna's voice}
<P>__{(o.s.; filtered; in spanish)}
<D>__{look out, behind you!!!}
<A>__{schaefer spins, his breath catching at the sound of anna's voice. wide eyed, straining, he waits, hearing only the muted flowing of water, the hissing and popping of the dying fire above, the shadows growing longer, darker with each minute. and then again, anna's voice.}
<C>__{anna's voice}
<P>__{(o.s.; in spanish)}
<D>__{...look out, behind you!}
<C>__{schaefer}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{anna...?}
<A>__{tracelike he moves towards the sound.}
<B>__{the hunter}
<A>__{his head canted, throat distended, utters another mimicry.}
<B>__{schaefer}
<A>__{moving towards the space between two boulders from which the voice seems to emanate.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{anna...?}
<B>__{the hunter}
<A>__{his ears now directed towards the sound of schaefer's voice, his slowly approaching footsteps, raises his weapon.}
<B>__{schaefer}
<A>__{pauses before the opening of the passageway. all is silent. he hesitates to enter. listeneing. he starts to move and then hears a new voice:}
<C>__{hunter}
<P>__{(o.s.; mac's voice)}
<D>__{dillon, over here...}
<A>__{schaefer, horrified at the sound of the dead man's voice, backs quickly into the space between a boulder and the high rock wall of the ampitheater.}
