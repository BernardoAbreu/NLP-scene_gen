<L>__{interior bridge}
<A>__{standard, roby and hunter enter and drop into chairs. faust follows shortly. they all look blank, stunned.}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{what happened? where's sandy?}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{dead.}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{dead!}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{it's monstrous it grew, like some horrible tapeworm. we were completely unprepared.}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{it's still in the ship?}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{we'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there.}
<P>__{(throws a switch; circuitry lights up)}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{at least it can't get up here now.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{two down, four to go.}
<C>__{standard}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{that's right we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay and maybe drive it into the air lock.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{thing is, i'm about out of fuel.}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{there's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.}
<P>__{(rises)}
<D>__{i will go get it.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{no, i don't want us separated.}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{you just sealed it off; it can't get to that section.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{don't count on it.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{we sure need this flamethrower.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{all right... but do not}
<A>__{go below}
<D>__{decks.}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{right.}
<P>__{(heads for the door)}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{and be right back. faust exits.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{i think it's time we took a hard look at those heiroglyphs.}
<A>__{roby begins to punch buttons; the photographs of the heiroglyphics appear on some of the screens.}
<C>__{roby }
<D>__{can you make out any pattern in all that?}
<C>__{standard}
<P>__{(baffled)}
<D>__{well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{i know it looks like a senseless jumble, but if you look closely, there are recognizable forms.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{recognizable! in that?}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{in symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{well... i suppose that star shaped thing could be the parasite that got on broussard. is that what you mean?}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{and right next to it, that oval design with the markings it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{that next thing there six legs, tentacles that's the thing we saw in the food locker.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{so the next step should be }
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{ the big one. and there it is.}
<A>__{out of meaningless geometric symbols on a wall, it has become possible to recognize each stage in the alien's life cycle.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{this is all the same creature. we're seeing the different stages in its life cycle.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{... and broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{you will notice, though, that there are no more phases. only four forms are shown. after that the pattern repeats.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{which presumably means...}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{... more spores coming.}
