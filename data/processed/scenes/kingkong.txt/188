<L>__{exterior fallen tree glade day}
<A>__{angle on: ann's lungs are bursting, but the tyrannosaur is gaining on her ... she manages to scramble onto a fallen tree that juts out over a small cliff. ann clings onto the mossy log, and crawls towards the end ... the tyrannosaur cannot possibly follow her. she falls amongst the roots, lying as flat as possible, praying the tyrannosaur doesn't see her. it seems to work and it walks off. ann hesitantly sits up, thinking that she is at last free, only to turn and discover another is behind her! with an almost delicate movement, the tyrannosaur nudges the log with it's head ... causing it to lurch dramatically! the tyrannosaur pushes harder, sending ann over the side ... she just manages to grab hold of a branch as she falls. ann hangs on desperately ... she screams! ann is helpless ... the tyrannosaur positions it's head for the final lunge gaping jaws open impossibly wide ... at that moment: kong charges! kong meets the tyrannosaur head on at full speed! he swings, with his foot smashing the tyrannosaur against the fallen log ... ann loses her grasp and falls ... as the dinosaur sprawls onto the ground beside her ... in a flash, kong catches her mid fall ... rolling away as the tyrannosaur leaps up and tries to take another swipe.}
