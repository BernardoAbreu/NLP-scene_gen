<L>__{interior new york press conference day}
<C>__{don king}
<D>__{"rumble in the jungle!" that's the name i given it.}
<A>__{ali and don king hold court with the press. also there is george foreman and his trainer, dick sadler, and his manager, nilon.}
<C>__{don king }
<D>__{a historical happening. this event will show that the black man has arrived on the world stage. muhammad ali and george foreman in kinshasa, zaire.}
<T>__{press reactions:}
<A>__{where's zaire?}
<C>__{reporters}
<D>__{don. zaire? why not antarctica? what's wrong with new york city?}
<C>__{don king}
<D>__{because you miss the significance. i dream, as martin luther king once dreamt, that a man could be judged by the content of his mind. this is about black men helping black men, overcoming four hundred years of racial depression to the dawn of a new day of liberation...financial and otherwise.}
<A>__{king getting really evangelistic...}
<C>__{don king }
<D>__{it will raise up the spirit of our inner cities. it will rise up and fill with hope the souls, the unrequited needs of the black proletariat, that is, the discouraged, dispirited, denigrated, denizens of the demimonde, that is called...the ghetto.}
<A>__{ali's looking at him in amazement.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{man, you crazy.}
<A>__{don king laughs. as the press digs king...move onto foreman, and here's what's wrong with all of this...we see that foreman, eight years younger, two inches taller, almost as fast and seemingly twice as strong, is not beatable by muhammad ali. foreman just doesn't hurt you, foreman can kill you. how is ali not going to get killed by this man with death in his eyes and indifference on his face? meanwhile...}
<C>__{don king}
<D>__{ten million dollars. with one stroke of the pen, you split the world's biggest emolumation of the history of sports!}
<A>__{ali signs a contract; then foreman. flashbulbs.}
<C>__{don king }
<D>__{the "rumble in the jungle"!}
<A>__{don king bursts out laughing.}
