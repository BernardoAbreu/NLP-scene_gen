<L>__{exterior the open sea later}
<A>__{the bow of the albatross explodes through the top of a fifteen foot swell. the sky is clear but the wind is fierce. in spite of the seas the ship is trimmed and sailing well. the crew has never seen mountains of water like this. disaster seems imminent. bill has assembled them in front of the wheel house. they are all holding on for dear life. even john seems shaken. skipper magically stands effortlessly before them on the rolling deck. he remains perfectly dry.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{well... now that i have your undivided attention... i'd like to take this opportunity to make a few points...}
<C>__{terry}
<P>__{(aside)}
<D>__{this guy is certifiable...}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{suicidal...}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{the first thing is i don't like people talking when i'm talking so the two of you, shut up.}
<A>__{caught, terry and phil button up.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{second, the next one of you who doesn't jump like a bunny when mr. butler gives an order is gonna spend the rest of this trip scrubbing bilges. he's a better sailor today than any ten of you will be when this is all over.}
<A>__{skipper directs the next comment directly at john.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{and if i catch anybody, ever, jumping off a yard arm again i will personally break what bones are left and send you home in a wheel chair.}
<A>__{a wave explodes over the bow. a wall of water crashes over the deck knocking down several of the boys. terry can't take it anymore and explodes.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{we're gonna die!!! we're all gonna die!}
<A>__{he lunges at skipper but lawford one arms him.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{excellent pointerior as you might have noticed, being out here pretty much puts you in the moment. if you panic, if you lose your head, you die. maybe you take your mates with you. how'd you like to have to bet on terry here getting us home today? each one of you is responsible for the rest. "where we go one, we go all". if your buddy is asleep at the switch we're all fish food.}
<A>__{he's making his point which is lost on no one.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{the ship beneath you is not a toy and sailing is not a game. the albatross will take us far gentlemen, but she demands constant attention. respect her, and we'll do fine. oh, and one more thing. there is nothing that goes on, on this boat that i don't know about. she speaks to me in the night. so don't test me. not even a little.}
<A>__{skipper walks over and puts an arm around terry who is fighting sobs.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{nothing like experience to put things in perspective. huh son?}
<P>__{(to bill)}
<D>__{alright. let's go home.}
