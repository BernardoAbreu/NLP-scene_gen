<C>__{josie}
<D>__{wait a second }
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{no, not you bye }
<A>__{josie shuts the phone, looks around...retraces her steps ... bambi is gone. josie walks around the lot, getting visibly upset. in the corner of the lot, we see a group of denominators removing a big metal chain from around a group of tightly packed cars.}
<C>__{aldys }

<A>__{josie finds aldys standing next to her.}

<A>__{aldys motions up to a second floor window. guy and his group look down on them, laughing.}
<C>__{aldys}
<D>__{guy perkins and his amazing lemmings. they push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. we've taken to chaining ours together for safety. i'm aldys.}
<C>__{josie}

<C>__{aldys}
<D>__{they still would not know the difference between a synecdoche and a hyperbole.}

<A>__{aldys stares josie down.}
<C>__{josie}

<C>__{aldys}
<D>__{well, do you?}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "i could eat a horse."}
<C>__{aldys}
<D>__{nice.}
<A>__{they stop and look around.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{how long will they watch us for?}
