<L>__{exterior steep incline evening}
<A>__{the flashlight illuminates a set of prints descending down the incline.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{there more of her footprints.}
<A>__{tomas and vinh just stand like zombies. chuckie pushes vinh.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{what you waiting on? jackie chan?}
<A>__{vinh plods clumsily down the incline, followed by tomas. chuckie sweeps the flashlight across the gulch looking for a sign of della. chuckie shifts his focus to climb down the steep slope. as the light sweeps back across the gulch we catch a glimpse of della between some rocks at the far side. but the boys' eyes are elsewhere, focused on the steep incline ahead of them. della quickly ducks, draws her toolbox in tight and crouches low between the rocks. she watches the boys carefully as they climb down the gulch. there's the sound of a stumble followed by a splash.}
<C>__{vinh }
<D>__{shit!}
<C>__{tomas }
<D>__{what now, cabron?}
<C>__{vinh }
<D>__{fell in a frozen ass stream.}
<A>__{chuckie sweeps the flashlight towards them. della sees vinh trudging out of the stream, tomas descending the last few feet of the other side of the gulch and chuckie midway up. vinh jumps up and down trying to kick the water out of his sneakers.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{zipperhead!}
<C>__{vinh}
<D>__{kon'aro kusotare.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{you know we don't speak the chinky.}
<C>__{vinh}
<D>__{what's your game, chuckie? we left stumbling around in the dark while you hog the flashlight.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{i stole it. i get to use it. that's how it works. that right tomas?}
<C>__{tomas}
<D>__{right on, dog.}
<A>__{chuckie jumps down from the last rock and joins vinh and tomas at the edge of the stream.}
<C>__{vinh}
<D>__{what if i steal it from you?}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{there you go, bro.}
<A>__{he hands the flashlight over to vinh. vinh reaches for it. chuckie pulls it away.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{april fool. naw, wait a minute, it ain't april. must be christmas fool.}
<A>__{tomas smirks. vinh hangs his head down. they search for more prints, can't find any in the immediate area. chuckie shines the flashlight at the foot of a big rock.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{her footprints disappear at the big rock.}
<A>__{a beat. della clutches the lug wrench in her right hand. vinh shivers violently.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{head on up and search the slope. i will guide your way with the flashlight.}
<A>__{chuckie sweeps the flashlight across the gulch. della ducks. della needs to get out of there and fast. they begin to ascend the rocks. chuckie keeps the flashlight slightly ahead of them. della crawls stealthily between and behind the rocks, keeping as low as she can. dodging the approaching light. the boys crawl across and up and between the rocks with the dexterity of animals. della's so low she's scraping her knees and hands to shreds. she can see ahead where the rocks end and the trees begin. what was she thinking hiding here? it was too exposed.}
<C>__{tomas}
<D>__{we gonna put yo ass on ice, bitch!}
<A>__{god please help her make it back into the cover of the trees. della almost vomits. her hand grasps the last rock at the top of the gulch. she pushes the toolbox up on the ledge. her strength is ebbing but she tries to hoist herself up. the flashlight sweeps by. she lets go of the ledge and ducks. the flashlight sweeps by again. she huddles in behind a rock. waits a beat.}
<C>__{tomas }
<D>__{you going home in a casket tonight.}
<A>__{oh shit, they're approaching fast. she tries again to hoist herself up. she's almost up when the flashlight sweeps by again. this time, it catches her.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{there she is, top of the gulch!}
<A>__{she practically throws herself over the ledge. tomas scurries to the top faster than lightening, catches her leg as she crawls from the edge. thud. she kicks him in the face. della grabs the toolbox. makes a run for it.}
<C>__{tomas}
<D>__{ahhhhheeeeeehhhhh!}
<A>__{tomas falls back from the gulch side, loosening several rocks. the rocks tumble downhill, hit vinh.}
<C>__{vinh}
<D>__{ahhhhhhh!}
<A>__{chuckie scales the gulch behind them. vinh rubs his head. sees something between the trees. thinks it's huey.}
<C>__{vinh }
<D>__{huey?}
<A>__{he starts towards the brush.}
<C>__{vinh }
<D>__{is that you, homie?}
<A>__{chuckie catches up with vinh, breathless from climbing fast. vinh points into the brush.}
<C>__{vinh }
<D>__{i saw huey, there in the brush.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{chuckie looks around, hoping against hope that vinh may be right, that huey may just be alive. vinh becomes perplexed.}
<C>__{vinh}
<D>__{i saw him.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{sure you did, bro.}
<A>__{chuckie puts his arm around vinh and helps him up the rock side. vinh is shivering so hard he's almost sobbing. just ahead tomas pulls himself up and over the ledge.}
