<A>__{harvey walks towards the bus stop to send danielle to school. he holds her hand.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{ya know, you should write about things in your own life. like school and... ponies... i don't know, girl stuff...}
<C>__{danielle}
<P>__{(to harvey)}
<D>__{do you have to hold my hand?}
<C>__{harvey}
<P>__{(wounded)}
<D>__{what, are you embarrassed a' me? i know, i'm embarrassing. i felt the same way about my father.}
<A>__{danielle looks up at harvey like he's crazy.}
<C>__{danielle}
<D>__{no harvey. you're just squeezing it too hard.}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{joyce is right. you are obsessive compulsive.}
<A>__{danielle drops his hand and rushes onto the bus with other kids. harvey waves and watches as it pulls away. he turns and walks by himself down the busy cleveland street a familiar image from the opening. he's still hunched over. he's still harvey.}
<C>__{real harvey }
<D>__{yeah, so i guess comics brought me a lot. but don't think this is some sunny, happy ending. every day is still a major struggle. joyce an' i fight like crazy, an' she barely works. the kid's got a.d.d. and is a real handful. my expenses have gone up so much that i'm writin' freelance 'round the clock, just to make my bills. my life is total chaos.}
