<C>__{frances}
<D>__{i wondered a little why god was such a useless thing. it seemed a waste of time to have him. after that he became less and less, until he was... nothingness.}
<A>__{the audience consists of parents, students, and local dignitaries. we see several shocked faces. lillian is there also, smiling. seated next to her is a distinguished looking woman, alma styles. ernest sits on the other side of the auditorium, looking a little worried.}

<D>__{i felt rather proud that i had found the truth myself, without help from anyone. it puzzled me that other people hadn't found out, too. god was gone. we had reached past him. why couldn't they see it? it still puzzles me.}
<A>__{frances closes her notebook and looks up, waiting for some response. there is a deep shocked silence, then a smattering of applause. lillian claps enthusiastically, then rises to her feet. in the back a woman also stands.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you're going straight to hell, frances farmer!}
<A>__{a stately man sitting next to her, her husband judge benjamin hillier, puts a restraining hand on her arm. the woman continues to glare at frances. frances stares back, dumbfounded.}
