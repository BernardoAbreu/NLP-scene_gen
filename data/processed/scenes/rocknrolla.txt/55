<L>__{interior speeler night}
<A>__{all the boys are sitting around playing cards. the buzzer goes, buzzzzzzzzzzz, fred answers the intercom.}
<C>__{fred the head}
<D>__{yeah,...?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{come on up, but don't be wasting my time.}
<C>__{one two}
<D>__{is that archy?}
<C>__{fred the head}
<D>__{no, couple of oysters who got a little something to be viewed.}
<A>__{he presses the button and walks back to the group.}
<C>__{fred the head }
<D>__{how's your mum taking it handsome?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{she must be very unhappy, i mean a five stretch?}
<C>__{handsome bob}
<D>__{not again, please fred.}
<C>__{fred the head}
<D>__{sorry bob, i didn't mean to offend.}
<A>__{in the background we see the door open and in comes two thieving scotsmen, they are selling fur coats.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{who wants another cuppa?}
<C>__{one two}
<P>__{(raising his cup)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{mumbles}
<D>__{glass of milk for me, my love.}
<A>__{our thieves move over to the table. meet our cocky scotsmen malcolm and his partner in crime paul. malcolm drops his bags and starts to get busy. he's got a strong scottish accent that has been influenced by last nights crack for dinner and two large whisky's for breakfast.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{good afternoon gentlemen.}
<A>__{he coughs nervously as the boys look on dead pan. he sees dolly.}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{excuse me my love, any chance of a wee dram of water to oil the larynx?}
<C>__{fred the head}
<D>__{get on with it.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(cough)}
<D>__{ok gentlemen here we go. first, my colleague paul will be modeling the grey wolf.}
<A>__{we see paul who's obviously completely geared out of his nut, he's trying to squeeze in to the stolen grey wolf fur coat. it's far too small and the fur stops half way up his arms, it's not possible to do the buttons up.}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{i must apologize for my assistants handicaps. he has unusually long arms and an alarmingly small neck.}
<P>__{(beat, the crowd is unimpressed)}
<D>__{now, i do agree it doesn't seem like the right time to acquire a coat of such thermal efficiency. however, i have been informed that we are looking at a very white winter. plus gentlemen and fine lady,..}
<P>__{(he winks at dolly}
<D>__{who has got him a very large glass of}
<P>__{water)}
<D>__{christmas is always round the corner.}
<A>__{he downs the water without it touching the sides.}
<C>__{mumbles}
<D>__{where did you find these two junkies?}
<C>__{fred the head}
<D>__{what is this, a fuckin double act?}
<C>__{one two}
<D>__{shut up and tell us the price.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{all in good time gentlemen, all in good time.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{paul, why don't you sit down for a while.}
<A>__{if paul doesn't sit down, he's gonna fall down. he stumbles into the card table on his way to a seat, knocking drinks and cards everywhere. everyone protests.}
<D>__{malcolm (v.o.) (cont'd)}
<P>__{(from under the table)}
<D>__{next, we have a very much sought after affair seen in very, very glossy magazines,..}
<A>__{he jumps up wearing the most ridiculously oversized fur coat and matching hat you have ever seen.}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{the famous, but rare black bear from the dark mountains of siberian calcutta.}
<A>__{he starts to do a slow spin, at which point we see a large white stipe running down the furs back.}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{get an eye full of that stripe gentlemen.}
<C>__{mumbles}
<D>__{have a look at that, it's a six foot skunk.}
<A>__{everyone thinks its very fuckin funny. the laughter is interrupted only by the buzzer. buzzzzzzzzzz, fred goes to answers the buzzer.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{and all of this could be yours for a staggeringly low,...}
<A>__{cut to fred at the buzzer.}
<C>__{fred the head}
<D>__{all right arch.}
<A>__{back to the table, everyone's ears prick up at the name. malcolm pauses before he panics, he can tell something is up.}
<C>__{fred the head }
<D>__{yeah, come on up.}
<A>__{everyone starts tucking their money into their pockets. fred makes his way back to the table. he speaks to malcolm and paul.}
<C>__{fred the head }
<D>__{you two out, live o.}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{the back door.}
<A>__{malcolm knows this is a sign to go.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{come on paul, we'll be going now.}
<A>__{the two scotsmen race in their fur coats toward the back door. in walks archy with danny, the crew continue their card game.}
<C>__{fred the head}
<D>__{all right arch?}
<C>__{archy}
<D>__{fred,...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{the speelers very quiet today, everything all right?}
<C>__{fred the head}
<D>__{good as gold thanks.}
<C>__{archy}
<D>__{all right mumbles? one two? mumbles one two arch!}
<A>__{pause while the boys carry on playing cards.}
<C>__{archy}
<D>__{so where is it then?}
<C>__{one two}
<D>__{what, can't you smell it?}
<A>__{one two slowly kicks it out from under the table. archy leans over to take the bag and one two sticks a few notes in his pocket.}
<C>__{one two }
<D>__{and buy yourself a new pair of shoes.}
<A>__{archy turns and heads out he's smiling and mutters to himself.}
<C>__{archy}
<D>__{silly bastards.}
