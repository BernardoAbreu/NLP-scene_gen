<L>__{exterior trailer day}
<A>__{nicola anders, twenty something, a list actress, beautiful face scowling, is supervising her assistant ferrying clothes from a movie trailer to a limousine. viktor desperately follows after nicola.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{ nicola! how was your massage?}
<C>__{nicola}
<D>__{you're in breach.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{ is this about the new pages? i made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene }
<C>__{nicola}
<P>__{(wheeling on him)}
<D>__{it's not the size of the role, viktor.}
<P>__{(suddenly very cool)}
<D>__{am i or am i not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(regarding the enormous}
<D>__{silver fish behind them,}
<P>__{confused)}
<D>__{it's the biggest on earth! i swear! it's a 50 foot airstream they don't make them any longer than that.}
<C>__{nicola}
<D>__{taller, viktor.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{taller? what?}
<A>__{viktor looks up in horror. the trailer next to nicola's does indeed appear to be fractionally taller.}
<C>__{nicola}
<P>__{(walking away)}
<D>__{you've insulted me for the last time.}
<A>__{viktor looks to the tires. his face suddenly brightens.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{nicola, it's just the tires they're over inflated! i can fix it!}
<A>__{viktor grasps the air nozzle on a tire and begins desperately stabbing at it with a ballpoint pen. air hisses out.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{see, it's lower already.}
<A>__{nicola ignores viktor, marching towards her limo with her publicist. abandoning the trailer, viktor hurries after her.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{i beg you. you can't do this to me.}
<C>__{nicola}
<P>__{(looking back)}
<D>__{i had three other offers. i only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{then show some. they'll shut me down!}
<C>__{nicola}
<P>__{(opening the car door)}
<D>__{it wasn't working anyhow. the scene with the thousand geese i don't understand this film. i don't think anyone will understand it. i already put out a press release citing "creative differences".}
<A>__{viktor stops, nods resignedly suddenly very calm.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{you know what, nicola, you're right.}
<P>__{(picking up her last piece of luggage)}
<D>__{here, let me help you with that.}
<P>__{(holding the door for her)}
<D>__{you ought to go. the truth is i don't deserve you. this film doesn't deserve you. frankly, it deserves much, much better. the reason it's not working is because you're not about the work.}
<A>__{nicola is stunned.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(to the limo driver)}
<D>__{to hell, please.}
<A>__{the door slams and the limo roars away. viktor looks to the still hissing trailer tire. the crew regards viktor apprehensively.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(to the crew)}
<D>__{what are you looking at? get back to work.}
<A>__{the crew is uncertain what work there is to do.}
