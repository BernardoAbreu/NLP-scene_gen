<A>__{but she doesn't really have it in her to be ironic right now. leans back against the door. wilson remains silent. he's done the same to elaine now that he did to ed. almost magically induced her to a confessional verge. elaine, too, isn't sure she wants to be complicit in this revenge tragedy. but here goes:}

<D>__{she told you all about my details but not about his. lovely.}
