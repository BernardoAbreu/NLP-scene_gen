<L>__{exterior junkyard day 1995}
<A>__{evan is thirteen again. the scene begins exactly where evan's blackout occurred as a child. tommy has just knocked kayleigh unconscious with a wooden plank, lenny is frozen at the sight of crockett in the fluid soaked gunny sack. and evan, seething with rage, stands up with clenched fists and charges tommy at full speed. evan looks around, utterly confused by his surroundings.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{what the hell is going on?}
<A>__{before an answer comes, tommy smiles at his good fortune and swings the plank, hitting evan's head. evan is sent sprawling backwards, his forehead bleeding freely. tommy knocks evan hard in the ribs with his boots. evan writhes in agony, his face against the ground. lenny moves toward the gunny sack, lifts it and tugs desperately on the rope that traps crockett inside.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i can't undo the rope!}
<A>__{tommy spins around and flashes an evil smile.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{drop it or i will slit your mother's throat in her sleep.}
<A>__{as if on cue, lenny does exactly as he's told. his eyes begin to glaze over. evan, beaten and bloody, reaches out with his last bit of strength, grabs tommy's foot and holds on.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i got him, lenny. help crockett!}
<A>__{lenny remains frozen in place. tommy yanks his leg back, breaking evan's grip. evan groans on the ground in a writhing heap. tommy's voice hitches. his eyes water from pent up frustration.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{listen to me good, evan. there's a million other sisters in the world. you didn't have to fuck with mine.}
<A>__{tommy smiles viciously at lenny, traumatized to watch tommy pick up the lighter fluid and spray a liquid fuse from the campfire to the soaked gunny sack.}
<B>__{whoosh of flames}
<A>__{and evan passes out. flash!}
