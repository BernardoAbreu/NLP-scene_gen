<L>__{interior randy's trailer short time later}
<A>__{randy, standing in the middle of the trailer, does a jumping jack. he does another. a few more. he feels himself getting winded. a little woozy. he sits down. he sits still, trying to slow his heart. he starts to cry. angry, bitter, frightened tears roll down his cheeks.}
<L>__{interior cheetah's night}
<A>__{randy enters the club. it's crowded tonight. he looks around for cassidy. he spots her in a corner offering a customer a lapdance. the customer passes. she moves on. randy heads over. she gives him a friendly little cheek peck.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{hey, sweetie. you're back soon.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{ah, i was just in the neighborhood.}
<A>__{cassidy nods oh.}
<C>__{randy }
<P>__{("casual")}
<D>__{hey, feel like maybe grabbing a burger?}
<A>__{cassidy finds the offer a little odd. this isn't how they operate.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{i'm working.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{how `bout later, then?}
<A>__{she looks at him, puzzled. he seems off.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{can we talk for a sec?}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{sure. what's up?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{someplace more quiet.}
<A>__{randy glances toward the door. cassidy, catching his drift, looks at him, a little gravely.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{randy, i can't leave with a customer.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{i had a heart attack.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{shit. when?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{i needed to talk to somebody.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{you can't talk here?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{just a couple minutes.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{randy, i don't do that.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{cassidy looks at him, torn. she sees the need, the fear in his eyes.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{where are you parked?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{in back.}
<A>__{another pause of hesitation from cassidy. this is big.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{go to your car. i will meet you out there in 15 minutes.}
