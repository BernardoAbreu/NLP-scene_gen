<L>__{interior jake's dressing room madison square garden night}
<A>__{as a reporter and a photographer come through the door, we see and hear a commotion in the hall behind them. they rush in, look, and stop by the door. there is silence except for jake's uncontrollable sobbing. the atmosphere is like that of funeral. jake is seated behind the rubbing table. he is still in his leopard skin robe. his head hangs low as he sobs. the photographer snaps a picture. the handler motions to him to stop, and then goes and sits near the door. the reporter still stands near the doorway, seeming quite stunned by the scene he is witnessing, but nevertheless continuing to scribble away on his pad. joey, standing near jake, has his back to everyone; his shoulders are shaking, his lips are tightly drawn. he cries soundlessly. tony is pacing nearby.}
