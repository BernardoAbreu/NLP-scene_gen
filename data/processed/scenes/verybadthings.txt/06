<C>__{liz}

<C>__{liz}
<D>__{he's weird.}
<A>__{tight on charles moore late twenties, a chef in a very upscale, very busy kitchen. his name, "moore," is embroidered on his white chef's jacket. food orders fly all around as moore works with a mesmerizing focus, a poetic sense of purpose, fifteen things going on at once; he chops, sautes, braises, etc..., in a perfect mute silence.}
<B>__{fisher and liz still in line}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{he just doesn't talk a lot.}

<D>__{he's weird. and i expect more from you.}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{you expect more what?}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{you're going to be hungover for three days. like those guys on "oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{time out.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{it's vile!}
<A>__{people are staring.}
<C>__{fisher}

<D>__{i've seen it on television.}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{i'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.}
<C>__{liz}
