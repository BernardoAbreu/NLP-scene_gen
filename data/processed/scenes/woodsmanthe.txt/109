<A>__{vicki slowly drives by a series of parks, schools, malls searching. children abound, playing, running free, getting off of school buses, running to meet their parents. there is no sign of walter.}
<L>__{exterior park day}
<A>__{the girl walks into the clearing, wearing her binoculars around her neck. she stops when she sees walter sitting on the bench. walter continues staring at the trees. she walks over to him.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{see anything interesting?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{not yet.}
<A>__{the girl sits on the bench and pulls a small book from her backpack. she starts writing in it. walter watches her. w}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{what are you writing in that book?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{it's my bird book.}
<A>__{she shows it to him.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{i've identified sixty seven species of birds this year alone.}
<A>__{the girl writes in her book. walter watches.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{where are your friends?}
<A>__{she continues writing ignoring his question.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{don't you have friends?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i have friends.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{a pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i'm not pretty.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{well... not in the common way.}
<A>__{she looks at walter.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{it means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked. most people only notice birds with the brightest colors.}
<A>__{the girl sits silently.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{what's your name?}
<A>__{she picks up her binoculars and peers through them.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{linda... susan... jennifer... jackie..}
<A>__{she continues looking, but she smiles.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{you tell me your name, i will tell you mine.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{robin.}
<A>__{walter laughs.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{yeah, like the bird.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{can i ask how old you are?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i'm twelve.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{no you're not.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i will be in three months.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i can't wait. i hate being eleven. it has to be the stupidest age in the world.}
<A>__{she looks at walter.}
<C>__{robin }
<D>__{what's your name?}
<A>__{walter hesitates then shrugs.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{walter.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{do you have many friends?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{how come?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{a long time ago, i was sent far away. when they let me come back, all my friends were gone.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{it sounds like you were banished.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{banished... yeah.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{birds are my friends. that sounds egotistical, but they are. birds know i watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{robin?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{would you like to sit on my lap?}
<A>__{robin looks at him.}

<D>__{what?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{would you like to sit on my lap?}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{no thank you.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i'm sure. thank you all the same.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{that's okay... doesn't matter.}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{do you want me to sit on your lap?}
<A>__{walter looks at her.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{yes. i would enjoy that.}
<A>__{robin shivers.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{are you cold?}
<A>__{she shakes her head. walter slides closer and rubs her arms with his hands.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{you look cold.}
<A>__{robin is silent.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{i know a place in the park where only very small birds go. there are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. it's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. would you like me to take you there?}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{they sound like finches.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{they could be finches. i don't know. we should go before it gets dark.}
<A>__{he stands up.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{ready?}
<A>__{robin doesn't move.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{my daddy lets me sit on his lap.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{does he?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{do you like it when he asks you?}
<A>__{she looks at him.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{her answer has a strange effect on walter, as if for a moment he has lost his balance. carefully, he sits down and stares at his hands. w}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{why not?}
<A>__{she is quiet.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{are you two alone when he asks you?}
<A>__{still silent.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{does he touch you?}
<A>__{robin looks through her binoculars.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{does he say strange things?}
<A>__{she scans the trees.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{does he move his legs in a funny way?}
<A>__{robin drops her head and quietly sobs. walter looks at her but makes no effort to comfort her.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{have you told your mother?}
<A>__{she shakes her head.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{is there anyone at home you can talk to?}
<A>__{she is quiet.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{is there a teacher you like at school?}
<A>__{she nods.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{what's her name?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{ms. kramer.}
<C>__{walter}

<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{yes you can, robin.}
<A>__{robin in silent.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{you said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. but you did. beautifully. i heard you.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{what will happen if i do?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{someone will talk to your daddy. and then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like.}
<A>__{tears come to robin's eyes again.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{but will he... ?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{your daddy will always love you.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i know because... it's just something i know.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i don't want to hurt my daddy.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{robin, listen to me.}
<A>__{she looks at him. walter struggles to find the words.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{at first he'll be upset... very upset. it's because he'll realize he's been a bad daddy. then he'll try... he'll try very hard to be a good daddy... people will say stupid, ignorant things about your daddy. that will be hard for you... but one thing i know for sure, he'll always love you... always.}
<A>__{there is a long moment of silence.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{walter?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{do you still want me to sit on your lap?}

<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i don't mind.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you should go home.}

<D>__{can't i stay a little longer?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{it's getting dark. go home.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{will i see you again?}
<A>__{walter is silent.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{go home, robin.}
<A>__{robin gets up, goes over to walter, and hugs him. walter starts to put his arms around her but refrains.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{bye.}
<A>__{she runs off. walter looks out, numb.}
