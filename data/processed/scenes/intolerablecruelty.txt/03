<D>__{that's delusional.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{my client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.}
<C>__{ruth}

<D>__{why only fifty percent, ruth? why not ask for a hundred percent?}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{oh brother. here we go.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{why not a hundred and fifty percent?}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{yes. maybe you're right, miles. maybe we're being too conservative. seventy five percent.}
<A>__{rex winces. rubs his stomach. marylin leans forward and whispers to him.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{do you need a tagamet?}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{you have some?}
<A>__{she removes a pack of the tablets from her purse, along with several vials of prescription drugs.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{these are yours.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{not according to mrs. rabinow.}
<A>__{she hands the pills to a grateful rex. their hands touch for a moment.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{have you been taking your digestive enzymes?}
<C>__{rex}
<P>__{(contrite)}
<D>__{sometimes i forget.}
<A>__{she looks at him like a concerned parent. miles and ruth watch the interaction.}
<C>__{marylin}
<P>__{(to the attorneys)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. where were we?}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{we were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{are you familiar with kirshner?}

<D>__{please let me handle this. okay, ruth, forget kirshner what's your bottom line?}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{the primary residence and forty percent of the remaining assets. you're becoming tedious miles.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{aren't we going in the wrong direction?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{shhh. please. let me do my job.}
<P>__{(to ruth)}
<D>__{buy a clue, ruthie. have you forgotten about kirshner?}
<A>__{ruth stands and closes her attache case.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{see you at the preliminary.}
<A>__{miles calls to ruth's retreating back.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{fine. we'll eat all the pastry.}
<A>__{going through the door, ruth doesn't react, but marylin following, glances back bemused, but with a trace of a smile. rex swallows two more tablets. he sits, looking despondent.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i think that went as well as could be expected.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{she always looked out for me.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{and she had private investigators assisting her.}
<C>__{rex}
<P>__{(sentimental)}
<D>__{she brought my digestive enzymes.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{in anticipation of making you sick.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{maybe i should reconsider my...}
<A>__{miles looks at him. shakes his head, sadly.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{a superficial display of marital solicitude, and you lose your resolve? rex. i underestimated you. but i'm your attorney, and if you choose to reward her for that mediocre charade of spousal concern...}
<A>__{he shrugs, helplessly.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{you're right. screw her.}
