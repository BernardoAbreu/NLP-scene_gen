<L>__{interior bridge on sean}
<A>__{trying his best to keep it together. he glances at his dead father, still unable to believe it.}
<C>__{sean }
<D>__{god, i wish this was a joke, but it's not.}
<A>__{sean slowly puts down the phone. he's lost in a daze. suddenly the ship lurches, a huge swell splashing the bridge window. admiral robertson's body falls from the swivel chair.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{what is happening???}
<A>__{sean regains his balance, moving to the computer console, looking at the omega and loran like he's never seen them before.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i don't know...we've gone off course or something...}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{what do you mean???}
<A>__{another wave hammers the bow. she's in a state of awful panic.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i don't know what i mean! all's i know is that there's no one guiding this ship anymore...}
<A>__{sean is starting to lose it. the fear of the ocean guiding her, rennie rushes to him, gripping and shaking him.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{can't you call for help??}
<A>__{sean tries to get a grip and assess the situation, pacing frenetically.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i think so. but we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{where are they?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{the bow...front of the ship. there's a hoist on each side that lowers them}
<A>__{she starts to exit.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i didn't mean for you to go!}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{just radio for help, okay???}
<A>__{she hurries out the door, working on terror induced adrenaline. sean rushes to the radio console, depressing the keying button, speaking into the mike.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{mayday, mayday, mayday...}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{as julius arrives with the others from the locker room. they react to the dead bodies while sean continues at the radio.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{please...can anybody out there hear me??}
<A>__{no response. wayne and miles rush in.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{sean, what's going on?}
<A>__{then he sees the corpses. he needs no further answer.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{jesus christ...}
<A>__{he's too scared to even videotape it. sean is bombarded with questions as he tries to figure out the radio.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{who did this, man?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{is the radio even working??}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{isn't there some international s.o.s. thing you can do???}
<C>__{sean}
<P>__{(suddenly remembers)}
<D>__{channel 16...the distress frequency...}
<P>__{(dialing knob)}
<D>__{mayday, mayday, mayday...this is the princess ruby. please, somebody answer...}
