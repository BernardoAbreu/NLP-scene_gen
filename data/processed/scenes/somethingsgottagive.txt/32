<A>__{harry wanders in with the scrapbook tucked under his arm. he notices a bowl filled with white beach stones. harry's brown stone sits at the top of the pile.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(complimented)}
<D>__{top of the heap...}
<B>__{close on julian}
<A>__{staring at erica. he can't get enough of her. they're in a romantic seaside restaurant. and erica's blushing for the first time in twenty five years.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{ so, when the land came up, i snatched it and the house was built in record time and...}
<P>__{(blushing to death)}
<D>__{it's like a thousand degrees in here.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{you know, they say doctors fall for people who need rescuing, that we have a need to take care of someone.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{really? i never heard that one.}
<P>__{(starts fanning herself with the menu)}
<D>__{julian, how old are you, like...}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{ thirty three.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{thirty three. okay, so, i'm twenty years older than you. more than twenty years older than you.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{you look fabulous.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{thank you but you know, i'm not sure where you were headed with that thing you were just saying, but in terms of us, you just want to be friends, right?}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{honestly? no.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{well, then, what is it that you... want to be?}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{i think i'd embarrass you if i told you.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i was embarrassed just getting dressed to see you.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{this may surprise you but some women consider me quite the guy. i've never been married. i'm a doctor. you wouldn't believe what catnip that is for some women.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{oh yes i would. but, you don't like girls your own age?}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{i do very much. but i've never met one i've taken to quite like this and when something happens to you that's never happened to you before, don't you have to at least find out what it is?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i suppose but, see, i don't date all that much or all that well...}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{oh, come on, you must beat them away with a stick.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{now you're kidding, right? no, guys my age, the ones i've met...well, i'm not that regular a person and they really like regular.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{men your age may be really stupid, you ever think of that?}
<P>__{(takes her hand)}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{yes i have. many times.}
<C>__{julian}
<P>__{(looks from her hand to her eyes)}
<D>__{there's something radically wrong with the idea that no one loves you.}
<A>__{ow. right to the middle of her shoulder, then her neck. julian kisses her palm, then her.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{i knew you'd smell good.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{it's just...soap...}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{how much is soap that smells like this?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i don't know. i got it at the market.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{erica, you're incredibly sexy.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{no, swear to god, i'm not...}
<A>__{meanwhile, harry is sound asleep on erica's bed her scrapbook open against his chest. we hear the sound of acar pulling up to the house. harry wakes up. oh shit. he leaps out of bed, this is the fastest he's moved in days. a bit disoriented, he straightens the covers, looks around for other evidence then hightails it out of there.}
