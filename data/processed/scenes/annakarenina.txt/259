<A>__{it's nearly the last of the hay. the scythe is being swung by theodore, known from last year. he is one of a dozen mowers. levin is among them, wielding his scythe. they have almost reached the end of the field, where the last of the hay is being pitchforked up on to the last piled cart. theodore's daughter in law, now visibly pregnant, is still adept with a pitchfork. it's a lowering thundery day at the end of summer.}

<D>__{i will be buying in feed before winter's over.}
<C>__{theodore}
<P>__{(scything)}
<D>__{well, you don't press people hard, but you live rightly, for your soul, not your belly.}
<C>__{levin}
<D>__{my soul! what's that? i know what my belly is. how do we know what's rightly? i believe in reason.}
<C>__{theodore}
<D>__{reason? and was it reason that made you chose a wife?}
<C>__{levin}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{theodore}
<D>__{you're a great one for reasoning, konstantin dmitrich, but what's rightly is outside your mathematic that's what's rightly about it!}
<A>__{this stops levin's scythe. he is illumined. theodore swings the scythe again. levin walks away, gives his scythe to a labourer by the cart, and keeps walking. he quickens his pace.}
