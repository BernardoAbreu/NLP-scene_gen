<L>__{interior lecture room. heidelberg law school. day}
<A>__{michael comes into the room and sits down, smoking a cigarette. rohl waits.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{so?}
<A>__{michael looks at him.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i have a piece of information. concerning one of the defendants. something they're not admitting.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{what information?}
<A>__{michael stubs out his cigarette.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{you don't need me to tell you. it's perfectly clear you have a moral obligation to disclose it to the court.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it happens this information is favourable to the defendant. it can help her case. it may even affect the outcome, certainly the sentencing.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{there's a problem. the defendant herself is determined to keep this information secret.}
<A>__{two students come in for the seminar.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{a moment, please. please.}
<A>__{chastened, they leave.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{what are her reasons?}

<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{have you spoken to her?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{of course not.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{why of course not?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i can't. i can't do that. i can't talk to her.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{what we feel isn't important. it's utterly unimportant. the only question is what we do.}
<A>__{rohl gets up.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{if people like you don't learn from what happened to people like me, then what the hell is the point of anything?}
