<L>__{exterior race track day}
<A>__{james carries on driving. flat out. but on the flat, niki suddenly comes out of nowhere. as if his car has 50 bhp more. and overtakes james. niki begins to pull away. and has the englishman beaten.. james sees red mist...and in an act of do or die vengeful madness, james goes into a corner far too fast... ...yanks his steering wheel. and outrageously shunts niki's car. an unforgivable act of unsportsmanlike vindictiveness. niki and james's cars both veer off...go into wild, lethal spins..but luckily for james he ends up facing the right way... ...and despite being badly shaken, dizzy, james is able to change gears, and continue driving... niki's car, by contrast, has stalled...and now ends up facing the wrong way on the track... niki's eyes look up to see all the cars coming over a brow, like a herd of wildebeest, heading towards him...}

<A>__{niki rips open his seat belt, is about to get out of his car, when one car shoots straight over the nose of his car. niki ducks, then bravely leaps for cover, as.... "smash", one of the oncoming cars shunts into his car, (it would have killed him instantly). "wham", another car narrowly misses him... "crash", another car forces niki into an evasive dive... cars scream past him on all sides as the race continues... niki, battered, shaken, has had an unbelievably close escape. he rips off his helmet, furious... and now we see niki lauda's face for the first time. sharp featured. intelligent eyes. dark hair. protruding teeth. something unmistakably rat like about him.}
