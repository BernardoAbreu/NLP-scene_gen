<L>__{interior guest room day}
<A>__{edward bloom, 61, lies asleep on the bed. although he's not the vibrant man we've seen before, it's not as bad we feared. the illness has been quick, and left him largely intact. there are no i.v.'s, no monitors, nothing. coming up to the bed }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{dad?}
<A>__{edward cracks open an eye, a beat before he focuses. he tries to say something, but no words come out. he looks over at a pitcher on the nightstand. will pours him a glass of water, helping him hold it to his parched lips. finished, edward sets down the glass by himself. a very long, tense beat. will almost speaks again to fill the silence. finally...}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you }
<P>__{(he points)}
<D>__{ are in for a surprise.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{am i?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{having a kid changes everything. i mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{did you do any of that?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{no, but i hear it's terrible. then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you think i'm up for it?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you learned from the best.}
<A>__{will doesn't rise to the challenge. a beat, then he remembers the can of ensure. holds it up. edward recoils.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{just drink half the can. i will tell her you drank the whole thing. everyone wins.}
<A>__{a beat, then edward rolls his eyes. fine. will cracks open the can, finding a straw on the nightstand.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{people needn't worry so much. it's not my time yet. this isn't how i go.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{truly. i saw it in the eye.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{the old lady by the swamp.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{she was a witch.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{no, she was old and probably senile. maybe schizophrenic.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i saw my death in that eye. and this is not how it happens.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{so how does it happen?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{surprise ending. wouldn't want to ruin it for you.}
<A>__{edward slurps down as much of the ensure as he can stand, then pushes the can away. he swallows with difficulty.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{there was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when i came out of this coffee shop near the office.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{and every day i gave him a quarter. every day. then i got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. and when i went back there, you know what he said?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what did he say?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you owe me three fifty.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{true story.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{when did you ever work in an office?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{there's a lot you don't know about me.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you're right.}
<A>__{edward gives a wry smile. he walked into that.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{your mother was worried we wouldn't talk again. and look at us. we're talking fine. we're storytellers, both of us. i speak mine out, you write yours down. same thing.}
<A>__{will won't commit to edward's assessment.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{dad, i'm hoping we can talk about some things while i'm here.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you mean, while i'm here.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i'd just like to know the true versions of things. events. stories. you.}
<A>__{edward laughs a little, which becomes a cough. the hacking escalates until another drink of water gets it under control. it's not clear whether any of this was an act to keep from talking.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. if you wanted to you could...}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i will.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you know where the chemicals are?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i used to do it when you were gone, remember? i used to do it a lot.}
<A>__{he didn't mean for that to sound so pointed. taking the half empty ensure, will gets up to go. he's at the door when...}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i was never much for being at home, will. it's too confining. and this, here. being stuck in bed. dying is the worst thing that ever happened to me.}
<A>__{he smiles at his joke.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i thought you weren't dying.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i said this isn't how i go. the last part is much more unusual. trust me on that.}
