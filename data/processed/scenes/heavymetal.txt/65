<B>__{stepek}
<A>__{he is losing his grip with one hand, but still desperately clinging on to a bunch of cables with the other. suddenly an ugly pincer cuts the cables and stepek is gone ... out into the night.}

<B>__{the plane}
<A>__{suddenly the no. 2 engine begins to backfire, blasting back large gobs of orange flame. the oil, heat and manifold gauges are off the dial and red lights frantically flash. desperately the pilot looks out of the window. pieces begin flying off the engine. the cowling disintegrates revealing the bare engine beneath. small figures are frantically busy ripping the engine to pieces.}

<D>__{jesus h. christ!}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{hold 'em off. i'm taking her down.}
<A>__{he peers out at the incredible sight of the creatures ripping off the wing skin and tearing huge plates from the cowlings. the camera pans down to his feet as the hatch door handle twists and then bursts open. a dozen bat like creatures swarm in. the navigator panics and reaches up, grabbing the flare gun from its rack. he screams as the creatures attack and shoots right through the creatures, bathing the aircraft with a bright ruby glow.}
