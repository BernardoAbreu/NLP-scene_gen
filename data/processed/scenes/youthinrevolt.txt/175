<L>__{interior saunders' mobile home night}
<A>__{the saunders and extended family take their seats at the polished mahogany table crammed with turkey, yams, mashed potatoes, and cranberry sauce. they all lower their heads and lacey leads them in prayer.}
<C>__{lacey}
<D>__{dear lord...}
<A>__{mr. saunders emits a long, low, fog horn of a fart that ends badly. the others exchange glances but he and his wife still have their heads solemnly bowed.}
<C>__{lacey}
<D>__{dear lord, thank you for this bounty. help us to be tolerant of others especially the boyfriends and girlfriends of our immediate relations. amen.}
<C>__{everyone}
<D>__{amen.}
<A>__{they begin eating. a helicopter passes by outside, search light briefly coming through the windows. nick watches mr. saunders take a handful of mashed potatoes and apply it to his face like war painterior}
<C>__{mrs. saunders}
<D>__{paul? your father looks rather strange.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{well, mother, he is sitting in his own bowel movement.}
<C>__{mrs. saunders}
<D>__{that's no excuse.}
<A>__{another helicopter passes overhead.}
<C>__{taggarty}
<D>__{the food is delicious, paul.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sister, darling, how long has it been since we all observed the rituals of thanksgiving?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{not long enough, paul.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i hope it's the first of many such occasions for me.}
<A>__{sheeni narrows her eyes at him. a long beat as they all dine in silence. then mrs. saunders croaks out in song.}
<C>__{mrs. saunders}
<D>__{siiiilent night, hooooly night aaaall in calm, aaall is bright...}
<A>__{paul begins humming approvingly and one by one the others accompany her as mr. saunders pretends to conduct them with a drumstick.}
<C>__{everyone}
<D>__{round yon virgin mother and child holy infant so tender and mild sleep in heavenly peace... sle eep in heavenly pee eace.}
<A>__{and with that, the doorbell rings. taggarty gets up and opens the door.}
<C>__{taggarty}
<D>__{oh, trent, you made it.}
<A>__{nick glances up with a start as trent preston makes his entrance. he's not quite the deity nick's expected, but rather a fairly plain, blond with slightly androgenous features and a certain flamboyance. his black eye, courtesy of ed solomon, still remains.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{hello, taggarty. hello, everyone.}
<A>__{mr. saunders grunts his acknowledgement as he takes the pitcher and pours water into his own lap.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{trent, darling, this is nick.}
<A>__{trent swivels slowly around and they lock eyes.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{nick, at last we meet.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{hello, trent.}
<C>__{taggarty}
<D>__{have a seat, trent.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{i'm sorry, taggarty, i can't stay. i have bad news.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{bernice lynch has tried to commit suicide.}
<A>__{sheeni and taggarty gasp. nick swallows hard.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{she swallowed a number of sleeping pills, and is now in a coma.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{the poor girl.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{there's more. before i left school, i searched her room.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{did you obtain proper authorization from the officials?}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{no, nick, i acted on my own initiative. in bernice's closet, i found this letter.}
<A>__{he dramatically extracts the letter from his pocket.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{in the letter, the writer instructed bernice to begin sedating sheeni with drugs he himself supplied.}
<C>__{taggarty}
<D>__{nick, you didn't!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{well, you see...}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{nick! you could have killed me!}
<C>__{mr. saunders}
<D>__{who died?}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{no one yet, mr. saunders.}
<A>__{mrs. saunders points a liver spotted finger in his direction.}
<C>__{mrs. saunders}
<D>__{arrest him!}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{i can't arrest him. but i have called the santa cruz police. they are on their way here now.}
<A>__{nick places his napkin next to his plate and stands.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{well, i shall be going now. please continue without me.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{nick, i suggest you remain here and face the consequences like a man.}
<A>__{nick stops in front of trent.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{thank you for that unsolicited counsel, trent. and please, do drop dead.}
<A>__{the other guests murmur their shock. nick stops in the doorway.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{goodbye, sheeni. i did it all for you.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{you are completely contemptible, nick twisp. i never wish to see you again.}
<A>__{with the dreadful proclamation ringing in his ears, nick leaves.}
