<A>__{tom wears his metal bunny mask. sam wears her hooded sweatshirt and jeans, and her right hand is bandaged. the metal shard is embedded under the skin of her forehead... they move slowly and methodically until they reach the center of the empty lot. there are lights on in the closed department store, but the parking lot is mostly dark.}
