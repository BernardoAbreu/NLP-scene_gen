<L>__{exterior camp 8 yard day}
<A>__{abernathy holds his newborn grandson up next to ray's face. hmm. scowling, he moves a little further down the line, scrutinizing the features of each man. he pauses in front of claude, holds up the baby. maybe. abernathy stops in front goldmouth. holds up the baby. the possibility makes him shudder. he moves on to can't get right. his eyes narrow.}
<C>__{abernathy}
<D>__{i know it was somebody from this camp. i can feel it in my bones.}
<A>__{disgusted, abernathy hands the baby back to mae rose. then he turns, walks back to can't get right and places a revolver against his head.}
<C>__{abernathy}
<D>__{do you know who the father of that little chocolated baby is?}
<A>__{can't get right nods slowly. abernathy smiles.}
<C>__{abernathy}
<D>__{well, then, who is it?}
<A>__{up and down the line, the men brace themselves for the worst. can't get right just grins. enraged, abernathy cocks the revolver. that's when ray steps forward.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{the baby's mine, boss.}
<A>__{stunned, abernathy lowers the gun and approaches ray. then claude steps forward.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{he's lying, boss. i'm the father of that baby.}
<A>__{confused, abernathy looks back and forth between the two men. then willie steps forward.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{actually, it was me, boss. i know i may look old...}
<C>__{biscuit}
<D>__{any fool could see that baby's mine, boss.}
<C>__{cookie}
<D>__{i beg to differ. that cute little rascal belongs to me...}
<C>__{poker face}
<D>__{i'm the father...}
<C>__{radio}
<D>__{i'm the father, boss...}
<C>__{goldmouth}
<D>__{i'm the father...}
<C>__{jangle leg}
<D>__{i'm the father...}
<A>__{and so it goes down the line, until every last man of camp 8 has stepped forward to claim kinship with the superintendent. even hard ass dillard can't help cracking a smile. disgusted, confused and thoroughly fed up, abernathy jams the revolver into his belt and climbs into the car. as he guns the engine, mae rose gazes out the back window, smiling one last time at the father of her baby. can't get right smiles back.}
