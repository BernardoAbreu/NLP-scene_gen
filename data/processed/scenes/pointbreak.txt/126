<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{utah asleep, flopped in a spread eagled x. we hear the bedroom door opening, see a slash of light fall across the bed. johnny doesn't stir. a shadow appears on the wall, moving toward him. an outstretched arm holding a gun. utah snores softly, sleeping like a baby. camera tracks in on his peaceful face. a single eyelid flutters. total silence, until... kaboooommm! the pillow beside him explodes into a blizzard of goosedown. johnny rears up, eyes wide, mouth agape. tyler stands above him, recovering from the kick of the smoking 9mm beretta in her hand.}

<D>__{a lawyer!? you lied to me!}
<A>__{she throws his fbi gold star at his face.}

<D>__{look, tyler, i can }
<A>__{boom! tyler squeezes off another round. cascading goosefeathers falling like snow. utah flinches sideways.}

<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{fuck you, johnny utah. fuck you!! don't you have a soul? goddamn you to hell!}
<A>__{she goes limp as the sobs rack her body. the gun flops from her grip. utah sweeps it under the bed with his foot. he moves to gently comfort her. she bolts at his touch, running from the bedroom. utah is up and hopping into his pants to follow her. he stumbles.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{tyler! wait!!}
<A>__{from the living room we hear a rattling of keys, the front door opens and slams shut. he hobbles to the door, favoring his knee. opens it. we hear the porsche screeching away. utah sags, the breath coming out of him long and slow.}
