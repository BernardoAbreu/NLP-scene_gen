<L>__{interior forest night}
<A>__{starla keeps running, when she trips and falls. she looks down to see she stumbled over old barbed wire fencing, now long fallen and curling on the forest floor. starla forces herself up, as jack closes in. jack grabs onto her blouse, screeching furiously. when he hears something and looks over to see: bill's police car, cruising over the forest floor, directly toward him. jack, frightened, lets go of starla. he's about to get hit when the police car suddenly stops, jammed between two trees, inches from jack. jack smiles, and moves toward bill but starla rises behind him, holding a sharp rusty stake from the barbed wire fence. she thrusts it forward, hard; and it pops out the front of jack's neck. jack turns to look at starla, and topples over into the leaves. bill backs the car out from between the trees. he sees the older cop and redneck coming in toward them.}

<A>__{trevor and starla get into the car. the older cop watches them back away and yells:}
