<L>__{interior dellas's house evening}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{where the hell have you been?}
<A>__{kenneth's voice meets her as she steps into the house. nice welcome. she doesn't respond. closes the door behind her. walks into the house. there he is ahead, leaning against the office door. beer in one hand, remote in the other. the tv blaring behind him.}
<C>__{kenneth }
<D>__{i said....}
<A>__{he's about to begin shouting again when he notices something's not right about her.}
<C>__{kenneth }
<D>__{della?}
<A>__{he switches the tv volume down using the remote.}
<C>__{kenneth }
<D>__{della honey are you all right?}
<A>__{she stares back at him coldly.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{please don't call me that. don't ever call me that again.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{she steps slowly towards him. sees a violent adventure flick wrapping up behind him on tv. the end credits scroll down the screen.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{i just wanted to get home to my babies.}
<A>__{kenneth cannot understand her garbled words. he sees the dried blood on her chin, matted mud on her coat.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{what happened to you?}
<A>__{she just stares.}
<C>__{kenneth }
<D>__{was there an accident?}
<A>__{she keeps staring, looks at him with a cold odd expression. she needs to be held like a child but he doesn't even move towards her. just stands there like a jerk, unsure of what to do, so he takes a swig of beer.}
<C>__{kenneth }
<D>__{are you hurt?}
<A>__{that swig of beer turns what was left of her love for him to stone. a beat.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{are they okay?}
<A>__{without waiting for an answer.}
