<L>__{interior sharon's apartment night}
<A>__{she is just returning home after her shift, very tired, drained. she absently turns on the tv, the stereo. she notices a blinking light on her message machine and hits the button.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{i bet you feel real proud of yourself, shar, knocking me down in front of my family. you know what i've got in my hand? i've got a polaroid picture of my busted up face, and i'm thinking of sending it to your department, to your lieutenant. i'm going to turn you in to the police, shar, and see how you like it.}
<A>__{the message ends. she stands there a moment.}
<C>__{sharon}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{oh, god. oh, shit.}
<A>__{she sits on the edge of a chair, worried, deep in her thoughts, hitting bottom the darkness engulfing her. in a moment, she looks at her desk, walks there, opens a drawer, pulls out that piece of tape with catch's number on it but it is all stuck to itself. she hesitates, then starts to pick it apart when a knock at the door makes her jump. she wonders, then, somehow, she knows. she walks to the door.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{it's you, right?}
<A>__{she unlocks and opens the door, stares at catch, very vulnerable, on the very edge, her pain and fear over larry just under the surface. catch holds a box of cookies as an offering.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{can you just shut up? just shut up and listen.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i didn't say anything.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i don't want to talk. i don't care if you have to play some game and pretend you're a... 'angel of mercy' or... whatever. i don't care, but i don't want to hear about it. all right? i don't want to hear anything.}
<A>__{she steps back, allowing him in, and closes the door and turns to him.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{it's a bad night.}
<A>__{he sees her pain and puts his arms around her, pushes through his fear and holds her and she lays her head on his chest. he embraces her fully, and the effect on him goes deep, to his core, where there is both pain and longing, but he holds on to her, even rocks her a bit. she sighs. in a moment...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{this is good... but i'm too tired to stand up anymore.}
<A>__{he walks her to the couch and has her sit, and then slowly, gently, he "disarms" her. he lifts her leg, takes the ankle holster and gun off, puts it on the table. he turns her, takes the cuffs off her belt from the middle of her back. he reaches into her pants pocket and removes the mace. from her shirt pocket he takes her i.d. shield. he has her lie down on the couch now, their faces close, eyes locked. they linger...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{you want to kiss me?}
<A>__{he looks a little lost, but he nods, helpless. he comes toward her lips finally but just before they touch, she says, softly...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{kiss me someplace i've never been kissed.}
<A>__{he's not sure what to do. he begins to look her over as if hunting, and she gets a soft smile. he starts slowly toward her ear but she shakes her head. her shirt is out of her belt and her midriff bare, and he starts to move there, but checks her with a look. she shakes her head. he hunts. her smile deepens a bit. he takes her hand and turns it over, going for the soft flesh on the underside of her forearm, and she closes her eyes. he kisses her there softly, and then again, and then he lavishes kisses from her wrist to the underside of her elbow as she sighs with pleasure and draws up her knees in a kind of sensual glow that is leading them to... no. he stops. she looks at him, a deep look, soft voice.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{why do you stop? you always stop.}
<A>__{she has a glimpse of his mystery, the old sorrow, the deep pain. he hugs her drawn up knees, closing his eyes a moment. then he sits on the couch, puts a pillow on his lap and raises her slightly, lays her head on the pillow. he strokes her hair, her scalp as she closes her eyes and sighs, slowly moving toward sleep. our trumpet music slides in here, lush and dreamy as we linger a while, and then }
