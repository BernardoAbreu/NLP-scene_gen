<A>__{sits erectly in the brilliant scarlet coat of the first royal regiment of foot with gold braid, blue black facing and blue black breeches, cavalry boots, spurs, a tricorn, white wig (?) and a gorget (large medallion) around his neck. he's 28 30 and tough. he is self sure, principled reactionary. he believes human society is static & layered into hierarchies of class and they are absolutely impermeable. he opens a simple gold clasped case & contemplates its contents ... heyward's pov: case an enameled portrait of a dark haired young woman.}

<A>__{as a soldier is militarily first rate in his milieu: the open battlefields of europe. right now, however, he is about to enter the forests of north america. he closes his clasp and glances out the window as we enter albany and as a facade of buildings & people pass.}
