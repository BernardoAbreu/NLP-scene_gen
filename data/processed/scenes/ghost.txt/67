<L>__{interior kitchen that night}
<A>__{carl is pacing nervously. he seems very upset. after a moment he approaches molly. sam is behind her.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{molly, there's no one on earth who'd like it to be true more than me, but you've got to be rational about this. i understand your desire to hold on to him, but this... this is absurd.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{it was real, carl. she was real.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{listen to her, carl, goddamn it. she needs some support here.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{molly, you're a grown woman. how can you believe some fortune teller from brooklyn...?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{she was in touch with him.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i don't believe it, molly. not for a minute.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{come on, carl. open your mind.}
<A>__{carl sits down beside her.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{carl, she knew things.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{what kind of things?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i told you, the picture in reno, the starfish,... damn it, carl.}
<P>__{(with great difficulty)}
<D>__{she said sam knew who killed him. that he was set up... murdered.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{oh boy. this is getting deranged. we're going off the deep end here.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{give him the address, moll.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{she had a name, an address willie lopez, 321 prospect place. she said he had sam's wallet.}
<A>__{sam smiles. carl stands up. his voice begins to rise.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{this is sick. this is really sick. how can you swallow this crap? who knows if this guy exists? maybe she's just setting someone up.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{that's what i have to find out.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{find out? what are you talking about?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{sam wants me to go to the police.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{sam wants you to go to the police? molly! jesus! are you outta your mind? what are you gonna tell 'em? some storefront psychic's been getting messages from the dead? do you know how that sounds? you're talkin' ghosts here, for god's sake.}
<A>__{molly looks suddenly vulnerable.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. this stuff just really gets to me.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{you don't believe me. you don't believe any of this, do you?}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(half heartedly)}
<D>__{i'm trying to, but... look, if it'll make you sleep any better, i will check it out, okay? now why don't you go to bed. try and get some sleep.}
<A>__{molly looks at carl, annoyed. she doesn't believe him for a second.}
