<A>__{david watching bemusedly some way off. the mime is however delighted someone is taking an interest at last. he takes a handkerchief from bean's pocket, and gets bean to guess which hand the hanky's in. it's not in the left. not in the right. bean isn't the slightest bit impressed he just reaches round and takes the hank y from where it's tucked into the mime's trousers and heads away. as he moves off, the mime touches h' on the shoulder. bean turns and the mime starts a mocking gun duel. he draws his guns. bean is pretty unimpressed. the mime turns his back and walks the 10 paces to draw. 4 he turns .... but now bean decides to settles it once and for all. in a brilliant piece of big mime, he puts together the biggest gun ever seen outside an arnold schwarzenegger movie. he sets up a pedestal opens a case lifts out a hugely heavy gun then the 7 bits that click on that gun. then opens another case, and takes out the huge artillery shell to load it. the mime is getting very frightened. then bean pulls up an imaginary stool to sit behind his mega gatling gun. the mime begins to run away. bean twirls in his imaginary seat, and lines up his sights, following the terrified mime. finally, in a boom that almost knocks bean out of his imaginary seat, he fires. 10 seconds delay, and the mime falls in a very dramatic death, 50 yards away. bean is happy and heads back to the parking lot where david, arms folded, leans against his car. david gets into his car. bean opens the passenger door and thumps it loudly into the side of the expensive car next door (same as this morning).}
