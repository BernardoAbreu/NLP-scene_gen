<L>__{interior kirk's apartment}
<A>__{kirk and molly enter. the apartment is neat, clean and fairly sparse.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{it's not much, i know.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{no, i like it!}
<A>__{molly walks around and examines certain items. kirk quietly hides a framed picture of marnie. molly passes his computer desk where she coos at a screensaver of baby polar bears. just as she passes it, she bumps the mouse and the computer comes to life, revealing a "hot back door asians" website. molly didn't see it and kirk scrambles to turn off the monitor. she turns to see what he's doing. he smiles. she moves on to a rack of dvds.}
<C>__{molly }
<D>__{wow, we have a lot of the same dvds. life of brian, cool hand luke, family guy... beaches, kirk?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{what? it's a good movie.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i love that movie.}
<A>__{she spots a crate full of vinyl records.}
<C>__{molly }
<D>__{wow, records. no way! look at all this cheap trick!}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you like cheap trick?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{are you kidding? heaven tonight is the first album i ever owned! a hand me down from my big sister. she was the coolest person in the whole world.}
<A>__{she notices an upright piano in the corner.}
<C>__{molly }
<D>__{you play the piano?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{a little. my grandma taught me. it was kind of our thing. she was a great player. ragtime, show tunes, that kind of thing. i'm really not very good.}
<A>__{she plops down on the couch.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{oh, i will bet you're great. play something for me.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no, i can't really play in front of people.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{what, the stage fright thing? come on it's just me. please?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no, i really can't. trust me, you're not missing anything.}
<A>__{kirk decides to join her on the couch but then he balks into a little dance of almost sitting. he finally commits to sit.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{so you've never played in front of anyone?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{nope. almost did once. a talent show in high school. i just sat up there drenched in sweat. i really thought i could do it but then i made my big mistake.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{let me guess. you looked at the audience.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{yep. all these eyes on me. i'm shaking, my head is spinning, i'm trying to remember if i even play the piano... and then, i puked.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{right there on the stage?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{into the piano actually.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{shut up! you're lying! why would you do that?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{it was a reflex. i was trying not to barf on the floor. turns out it's a lot easier to clean puke off a stage than out of a baby grand.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{yeah, that has to be a real bitch. oh, i shouldn't be laughing. you poor thing.}
<A>__{molly brushes his hair back with her hand. kirk is frozen with fear. molly leans in. kirk also leans in but not too far. molly smiles, realizing that it's up to her to make this official. she takes him by the collar, reels him in and kisses him. they make out for a moment. kirk is near panic but he does his best to keep it together.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{sorry. i'm a little cotton mouthed. i'm going to get a glass of water. how 'bout for you? water? a nice glass of, you know...water?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{yeah. that sounds good.}
<A>__{kirk steps away from her and disappears into...}
