<A>__{moving with malik, who backs rapidly away from the restroom, reloading.}
<C>__{gib }
<D>__{freeze!!!}
<A>__{malik spins to see gib nearby, going into a firing stance behind a light standard. the terrorist doesn't hesitate. his beretta roars at 900 rounds per minute. gib tries to hide behind the light standard, which is about half as wide as he is. shots hit all around him, shattering window glass behind him. his stomach sticks out from behind the pole. he sucks it in. now his butt is sticking out on the other side. shots clang into the steel column, and riddle everything behind him.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{wrong! this is not good!}
<A>__{just when it looks like gib is going to get a 9mm tummy tuck, malik turns and sprints away, through shocked pedestrians. harry runs out of the restroom, trying for a shot, but there are too many people in the line of fire and malik knows it.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{get back to the car!}
<A>__{gib nods and heads the other way as harry takes off after malik. malik is fast and vicious. he hurls people out of the way, sending shoppers sprawling. harry is ruthless in his pursuit. they pound through the mall and out onto the street }
