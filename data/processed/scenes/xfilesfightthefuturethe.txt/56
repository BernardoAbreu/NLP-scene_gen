<L>__{exterior street outside downscale bar night}
<A>__{the street is empty, the hour is late. mulder moves to the curb.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{and what's that?}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{s.a.c. darius michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.}
<C>__{mulder}
<P>__{(rhetorical disbelief)}
<D>__{he just let it explode.}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{what's the question nobody's asking? why that building? why not the federal building?}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{the federal building was too well guarded.}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{no. they put the bomb in the building across the street because it did have federal offices. the federal emergency management agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. which is where the bodies were found. but that's the thing...}
<A>__{mulder's got his hand up for a taxi coming. it's pulling over as mulder steps from the curb, stepping away from kurtzweil.}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{...the thing you didn't know. that you'd never think to check.}
<A>__{mulder's got the taxi door open, turning to kurtzweil.}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{those people were already dead.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{before the bomb went off?}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{that's what i'm saying.}
<A>__{mulder stares at kurtzweil for a moment.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{michaud was a twenty two year veteran of the bureau }
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{michaud was a patriot. the men he's loyal to know their way around dallas. they blew that building to hide something. maybe something even they couldn't predict.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{you're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{and one little boy.}
<A>__{mulder gets in the cab, closes the door. rolls down the window.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{i think you're full of shit.}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{do you?}
<A>__{kurtzweil raps the top of the roof and steps away from the car. as the taxi takes off. we stay with kurtzweil, watching mulder's cab speed away. (note: this should also be covered from inside the cab with mulder, to play the scene out on him.)}
