<L>__{interior the grierson gallery. bernie's office day}
<A>__{bean at the computer. he's actually quite enjoying himself now. in fact, he's rather hogging the thing. this is, after all, an animated catalogue his area.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{i'm just gonna go see if annie needs me for anything. truth is, she smells kinda nice. okay? (grins).}
<A>__{bean smiles and gives kevin a thumbs up. kevin returns the gesture and exits.. back to the computer, bean clicks on an icon which takes him to the ground floor gallery. he clicks through various paintings and stops at the painting of the woman, in the castle, wearing the chastity belt. bean clicks and enlarges the painting to fill the screen. he happily hums the catchy tune from 'goblins 2' and homes in on the tiny padlock on the chastity belt. padlocks interest him. he clicks on the keyhole rapidly (as we have seen him do with the frog in goblins 2).}
<C>__{mr. bean}
<D>__{click! click! click! click! click!}
<A>__{.suddenly, to bean's surprise, the padlock starts to flash red...then the whole screen starts to flash ... before going dramatically back to black ... now flashing in the .centre of the monitor is an icon of a tiny key. beneath it, a row of six dashes appears (e.g ). a cursor is flashing over the first dash. bean is totally absorbed. he loves these kinds of puzzles. with one finger, he slowly types out letters on the keyboard (he has to search for some of them). as he does so, they appear over each dash in turn:}
<D>__{g o b l i n}
<A>__{a message pops up: "access denied" bean tries something 0 else.}
<D>__{g n o m e s}
<A>__{the message again: `access denied'. the room door suddenly opens! making bean jump! it's bernie. he cannot see the computer screen from the doorway.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{how goes it, bean? ready for the governor?}
<A>__{bean smiles and nods nervously. he knows he's probably up to something he shouldn't be.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{we need you downstairs in ten minutes and not a second more. period. oh, and put this on.}
<A>__{bernie throws bean a name badge with 'dr. bean' on it. bean nods. bernie exits. bean goes back to the code. he types in the first thing that comes into his head:}
<D>__{b e r n i e}
<A>__{that damned message again: `access denied'. then, as though something is dawning on him, he punches in:}
<D>__{p e r i 0 d}
<A>__{up comes a message: "code accepted". close on bean's face as light from the computer plays on it he reads it carefully and with interest. we cant quite read his expression but what he sees is a surprise and a puzzle. long meaningful pause as his eyes scan the screen.}
