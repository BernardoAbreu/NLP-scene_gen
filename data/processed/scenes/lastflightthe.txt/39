<L>__{interior nikki's suite later that day}
<A>__{phonograph music plays as an asian maid, the hotel's specialist in chinois pedicure, paints nikki's toenails. we pan up to discover nikki wearing a robe, sitting in a chair next to the phonograph, smoking a cigarette and checking on the progress of her paint job. a snappy knock at the door.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(wearily)}
<D>__{entrez!}
<B>__{the front door}
<A>__{opens and bill, looking dapper, enters.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{hi, nik!}
<A>__{then, shep enters, wearing his dark eyeglasses and carrying a bouquet of flowers.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{hello, nikki!}
<A>__{next, francis enters, sleepily.}
<C>__{francis}
<P>__{(in mid yawn)}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{finally, cary, who closes the door behind him.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{good morning, nikki.}
<A>__{the men are all: wearing suits and ties, pleased to see her, and stone sober. francis finds his way to the sofa, which has been returned to its proper spot in the room. he lies down and shuts his eyes.}
<C>__{nikki }
<D>__{hello, bill. hello, shep. hello, cary. hello, francis.}
<C>__{francis}
<P>__{(from the sofa)}
<D>__{morning, nikki.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i didn't expect to see you all so early.}
<A>__{shep puts the flowers in a vase.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{we camped on your doorsteps last night. and this morning we all moved in.}
<A>__{cary leans over her affectionately.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{despite your practically innumerable faults, we adore you. we've decided to adopt you.}
<A>__{bill and shep kneel next to nikki. bill notices the toenail painting.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well, for heaven's sakes! look at nikki! what are you having done to yourself, gal?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{whatcha having your toes painted for, nikki?}
<A>__{cary stands behind nikki as she looks down at her toes.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<P>__{(looks at bill and shep)}
<D>__{seemed like a good idea at the time.}
<A>__{cary smiles. nikki, bill and shep share a laugh. the asian woman goes right on painting as bill and shep study nikki's legs. during this, nikki hands her cigarette to cary who moves to put it in an ashtray by the window.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{why, look at nikki's legs, would you? that there is practically the loveliest pair of legs i ever saw in all my born days.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{like my legs?}
<A>__{cary stares out the window at a rainy day.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{look at those legs, cary. my, they nearly match.}
<A>__{cary turns from the window.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{did you ever see such a swell set of legs?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, what do you want me to do about it? burst into tears?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{would it embarrass you, nikki, if cary were to burst into tears?}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(looks at her legs)}
<D>__{on account of my legs? oh!}
<P>__{(turns to cary, heartfelt)}
<D>__{i think that would be sweet.}
<A>__{cary manages a slight grin. as he does, there's a knock at the door. everyone hollers, "entrez!" shep runs to the door and opens it.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{oh, boy! here come the drinks!}
<A>__{the others cheer happily. two hotel employees enter carrying trays loaded with already poured drinks. shep hands a glass to nikki.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{here, nikki, drink this.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{make you laugh and play.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{that's what i want to do, laugh and play.}
<A>__{shep hands bill a glass. francis sits groggily on the sofa, a drink in each hand. he polishes off one and then the other. he leans over and sets one empty glass on the floor but holds on to the other as he puts his head to the nearby pillow and dozes off. cary, bill and shep crowd around nikki who is still seated all have drinks. the tray carrying hotel employees have apparently exited. bill proposes a toast.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{here's to nikki's dainty legs. as smooth and hairless as an egg.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{wheee!}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{hurray!}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{'ray!}
<A>__{they drink. another knock at the door. they all yell, "entrez!" the door opens to reveal frink whose face falls when he sees the other men with nikki. the others are not happy to see him, either.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well! here comes that licentious old man. who invited him?}
<A>__{cary hands his glass to bill and moves to meet frink as he enters.}
<C>__{frink}
<P>__{(sneering)}
<D>__{still drinking?}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(shakes his head mockingly)}
<D>__{how can you tell?}
<A>__{cary watches frink approach nikki.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{morning, nikki.}
<A>__{after a pause, nikki looks up at him uncertainly as if she doesn't recognize him. then she peers at him through her lorgnette.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh, it's you.}
<P>__{(after a pause, reluctantly polite)}
<D>__{won't you sit down?}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{frink moves off to find a chair. shep sets down his drink and follows him. frink starts to move a chair but shep stops him.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{say, i don't think nikki likes you.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{oh, no?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{no. what do you wanna hang around for?}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{well, what do you hang around for?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{me? why, i came to bring nikki some posies. i will bet you didn't bring nikki any posies.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{i well }
<A>__{during the above dialogue, bill nudges cary mischievously and they glance down at the tray in front of them. they exchange knowing nods, pick up some drinks, bring them over, and offer one to frink.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{have a drink?}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{no, thanks.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{cure the shakes.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{i haven't got the shakes.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{let's see. hold out your hands.}
<A>__{bill and shep watch with interest as frink holds out his hands, palms up.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{no, turn them over.}
<A>__{frink turns them over, palms down. cary looks at frink's steady hands, impressed.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{say, that's pretty good.}
<A>__{cary looks down at the drink in his own hand.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{let's see if you can hold this.}
<A>__{cary sets the glass on top of frink's downturned hand. frink balances the full glass with ease.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{say, that's great.}
<A>__{cary places a second full glass on frink's other hand. frink balances both glasses with ease. cary expresses keen admiration.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{steady as a rock!}
<A>__{frink looks at the others, a little smugly. cary slowly backs away and walks off, as do the others. frink's face falls as he realizes he has been left standing in the middle of the room with two drinks balanced on top of his hands and no way to safely remove them. cary, shep and bill return to nikki and crowd around her.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, i guess that'll keep his hands out of mischief for a while.}
<A>__{frink, abandoned, reluctantly pleads with the others.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{hey. take these off.}
<A>__{but the others simply ignore him.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{now, let's see. where were we before we were so rudely interrupted?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{we were talkin' about nikki's legs.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{that's right. we were talkin' about nikki's legs. and havin' a fine time, too.}
<A>__{the asian maid who has been working on nikki's feet abruptly rises.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{finis.}
<A>__{the men cheer, "yay!" and nikki smiles at the woman as she exits with her tools. the men crowd closer to peer down at nikki's legs.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{let's inspect the job.}
<A>__{but nikki quickly covers her toes with a hand.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh, my poor toes. don't look too close.}
<A>__{nikki wraps her robe around her legs and stuffs them under body. since she's no longer using her footstool, cary commandeers it and sits on it.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, what's the matter with your toes?}
<A>__{nikki grows extremely somber and begins to tell a story very slowly. her eyes stare into space and her voice conveys terrible sadness.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{well... when i was a little girl...}
<A>__{a worried look crosses cary's face.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{... my mother bought me a new pair of shoes. ... and they were way too short. ...}
<A>__{shep and bill listen soberly.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{... and i had to walk all the way to sunday school and back. ... down the road. ... and it was hot and dusty.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(hand to his face)}
<D>__{oh, take her away! she's breakin' my heart!}
<P>__{(sobs)}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{and when i got home ... my toes were spoiled.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(on the verge of tears)}
<D>__{oh, dear, oh, dear.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{that's such a sad story. let's all have a drink, quick!}
<A>__{their eyes pop. the men jump up eagerly and run off. nikki, thoroughly nonplussed by this, takes a sip of her drink. shep, cary and bill crowd around a tray and start imbibing. meanwhile, frink looks around unsuccessfully for a way to lose the two glasses that are still balanced on his hands. for the first time in this scene, nikki is on her feet. she walks over to the drink tray and puts a friendly hand on the shoulders of shep and cary.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{and now would you all excuse me? on account of i'm gonna put on a dress.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, why not?}
<A>__{nikki walks off, exiting into her bedroom. the men continue to stand around the tray, drinking. in the background, francis sleeps on the sofa. over by the fireplace, a frustrated frink, still balancing the two drinks, casts a dirty look at the others. he angrily hurls the glasses into the fireplace, smashing them loudly. francis, startled awake by the noise, jumps off the sofa. the others stare at him.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{my, my. what's he getting so excited about?}
<A>__{frink, furious, rubs his hands with a handkerchief and stuffs it in his pocket.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{you guys think you're so darn smart.}
<A>__{shep, bill and cary laugh at this. cary consults his pocket watch.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, cheerio, fellas. i'm off.}
<A>__{bill waves goodbye. cary eats a last olive, tosses the toothpick and heads for the front door.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{see ya later.}
<A>__{cary exits as nikki's voice drifts in from:}
<B>__{the open bedroom doorway}
<C>__{nikki }
<D>__{what are the plans for the day?}
<A>__{shep, drink in hand, enters and leans on the wall outside the door.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{well, on account of it's raining and everything, we thought we'd go over to the cluny and play billiards and drink beer.}
<C>__{nikki }
<D>__{how about cary?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{went to get his hat and coat. he's going to pere lachaise.}
<C>__{nikki }
<D>__{pere lachaise? what's pere lachaise?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{a cemetery. how 'bout you coming with us?}
<C>__{nikki }
<D>__{no. i'm going with cary.}
<C>__{shep}
<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{you've been invited?}
<A>__{nikki appears in the doorway, dressed to go out.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{do you think cary might object?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{well, i have an idea he'd like to be alone.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{why alone?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{well, cary likes to be alone. he's as brittle as a breadstick. one silly crack from you and he might break up in sections.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(thinks about this)}
<D>__{well, then, i don't think he should be left alone.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{tell me, what's cary doing in paris?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{what are we all doing in paris?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i know. but why doesn't he go home?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{well, he's not ready to go home. what could he do if he went home? have people cry over his hands?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{well, it seems a pity to go on like this. he's such a sweet soul.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{one of the best.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{isn't he just sort of wasting himself?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{on the contrary. he's trying awfully hard to get hold of himself.}
<A>__{lost in thought, nikki moves off and a worried shep follows her to:}
<B>__{the front door}
<A>__{shep stops nikki from leaving. she's a little downcast as he admonishes her:}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{now, listen. if you tag along, for heaven's sake, be careful what you say. don't start getting sorry for him and don't cry over him.}
<P>__{(with a chuckle)}
<D>__{and, above all, don't make any unfortunate remarks, hear?}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(earnest)}
<D>__{oh, i won't. why, who ever heard of such a thing?}
<A>__{nikki opens the front door and exits into:}
<B>__{the hallway}
<A>__{where cary carrying coat, hat and cane emerges from a suite across the hall from nikki's and heads for the elevator. he stops when he hears nikki calling to him. she runs to join him.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{cary?! cary? i'm coming with you.}
<A>__{without waiting for a reply, she starts for the elevator, then stops to look down at her shoes.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oooh!}
<P>__{(to cary)}
<D>__{ooh, wait for nikki!}
<A>__{she leaves him and runs back to:}
<B>__{the front door}
<A>__{of her suite where shep still stands. he watches with surprise as nikki runs in.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(calls back to cary)}
<D>__{wait for nikki!}
<A>__{puzzled, shep follows nikki who rushes to:}
<B>__{her bedroom closet}
<A>__{nikki draws the curtain to reveal her enormous collection of dresses and shoes. shep, drink in hand, wanders in slowly and leans against the doorjamb as he watches nikki pull off one pair of shoes and put on a seemingly identical pair of red ones.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{what are you changing your shoes for?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{on account of i can walk faster in red shoes.}
<A>__{shep watches her hop and scurry off.}
