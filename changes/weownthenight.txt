Outmanned and outgunned, demoralized by cutbacks and scandal, the Police find themselves burying one of their own at the rate of twice a month... The WORDS TURN BLOOD RED, then DISAPPEAR.

ROSARIO is behind him, fixing herself and walking toward the front of the club. Bobby enters the PULSING, VITAL HEART of the place. As he appears, everyone approaches, happily shouting out his name. He is having a blast. Bobby is the master of this domain. An `80's version of Tony Manero from SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, but without kitsch. He is genuine cool. MUSIC: BLONDIE'S "HEART OF GLASS." Bobby waves hello to people, greets them ("Hey, baby!"), a pretty girl kisses him (the women love him). Moves with a swagger, a DANCE. As he sways, he re-buttons his shirt, claps his hands. He is the CLUB MANAGER, and HE LOVES every minute of it. He's GIDDY, ALIVE, a PERMANENT GRIN. WE WANT HIS LIFE. SENSUOUS, SEDUCTIVE, INCREDIBLE FUN. A MAN waves to BOBBY. Bobby SEES: seated at a table, surrounded by his gang: VADIM NEZHINSKI. Thirty-five, acne- scarred, huge black pompadour, big gut. One of his men, PAVEL LUBYARSKY, is next to him. Bobby nods back to them.}

<ACTION>__{Then he spots an area in which the SMOKE FLOWS UNNATURALLY, AGAINST THE BREEZE, as though it SURGES AROUND SOMETHING... SOMETHING COVERED IN SMOKE, STANDING... A GUST OF WIND PASSES--REVEALING--A SILHOUETTED FIGURE, WITH HIS ARM RAISED, POINTING, RIGHT AT BOBBY. VADIM NEZHINSKI, POISED TO SHOOT. Within what seems like a split second, Bobby raises his SHOTGUN and FIRES it. VADIM CRUMPLES TO THE GROUND. A DIRECT HIT to the chest. Bobby lifts his shotgun and approaches. The weeds separate, REVEALING NEZHINSKI, with a look on his face that registers a kind of shock, a shock that he's been hit. Nezhinski sees Bobby standing over him. With all the energy he has in the world:}
