<A>__{tiffany looks around the room generally and then turns her attention completely to the lament configuration. she picks it up and turns it around in her hands, studying each of its faces intently. she begins trying to move the interlinked pieces within it. at first she has no success; the box appears to be one solid construction with no internal movement possible. she stops her attempts and studies it again for a moment, her face still impassive. then she gives a tiny smile and begins again. her movements are faster now, less tentative. suddenly, there is a click and one of the panels on the box slides out slightly. the little music box tune begins to play. to tiffany this is a marvelous reward something the jigsaw never offered and she lets out a little sound in response, somewhere between a sigh and a delighted giggle. it tempts her to even greater skill and her delighted fingers fly over the box. another panel moves. then two more. the tune is prettier and fuller.}
