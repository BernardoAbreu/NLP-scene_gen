<L>__{interior mike's audi night}
<A>__{a somber mike drives alongside the los angeles river. an old song plays low on the radio... static... then... boom. thunder roars scaring mike and literally shaking the audi. splash. rain drops in buckets.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{jesus!}
<A>__{mike turns the wipers on high. not much help. he slows the car to a crawl, straining to see out the windshield. lightning flashes. we see the janitor leaning over the railing looking into the raging river. mike brakes, throws his door open, jumps out into the pouring rain.}
