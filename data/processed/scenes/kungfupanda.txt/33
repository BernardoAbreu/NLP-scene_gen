<L>__{interior training hall}
<A>__{the doors open, revealing po nursing his wounded finger. shifu steps out of the way and po's face goes into shock. the five are performing death defying kung fu moves in the training hall. tigress smashes a swinging, spiked ball of wood. angle on an awestruck po, as shards of wood blast into his face. po is intimidated and overwhelmed. shifu scowls at po.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{let's begin.}
<A>__{he gestures to the gauntlet. po's eyes go wide.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{wait wait wait...what? now?}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{yes...now. unless you think the great oogway was wrong, and you are not the dragon warrior.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{oh, okay. well i don't know if i can do all of those moves.}
<A>__{shifu walks away and po half heartedly follows.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{well, if we don't try, we'll never know will we?}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{uh, yeah. it's just, maybe we can find something more suited to my level.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{and what level is that?}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{well, ya know...i'm not a master, but uh, let's just start at zero, level zero.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{there is no such thing as level zero.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{hey! maybe i can start with that.}
<A>__{po points at a rather friendly looking dummy.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{that? we use that for training children. and for propping the door open when it's hot. but if you insist...}
<A>__{relieved, po turns to the dummy. the five gather around him.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{whoa. the furious five. you're so much bigger than your action figures except for you, mantis. you're about the same.}
<A>__{mantis gives him a look.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{go ahead, panda. show us what you can do.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{um, are they gonna watch? or should i just wait until they get back to work or something...}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{hit it.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{ok. i mean, i just ate. so i'm still digesting... so my kung fu might not be as good as later on.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{just hit it.}
<A>__{po psyches himself up, doing some jack fu.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{alright. whatcha got? you got nothing cause i got it right here. you picking on my friends? get ready to feel the thunder. i'm comin' at him with the crazy feet. whatcha gonna do about my crazy feet? i'm a blur. i'm a blur. you never seen bear style, you only seen praying mantis! or... i could come at you monkey style. or... i'm comin' at ya snikity snake.}
<A>__{shifu and the five stare at po, perplexed.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{would you hit it!}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{alright...alright.}
<A>__{po lightly hits the dummy and it rocks back into place.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{why don't you try again? a little harder...}
<A>__{po punches it again, knocking it all the way backwards. he turns to shifu, smug.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{how's tha }
<A>__{whap! the dummy rights itself and smacks po. totally dazed, po trips and stumbles his way through the obstacle course. the five instinctively step forward to help po, but shifu holds up his hand to stop them.}
<B>__{back on po}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{ow, that hurts.}
<A>__{a spiky tethered ball sends po flying into the jade turtle exercise, where it rattles him around.}
<C>__{shifu}
<P>__{(to the five)}
<D>__{this'll be easier than i thought.}
<A>__{back to po in the turtle bowl.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{feeling a little nauseous.}
<A>__{the turtle spills him out and he stumbles into the army of wooden dummies.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{ow, those are hard! ooh! i think}
<C>__{i...}
<A>__{the last dummy whaps him in the crotch and everything becomes still.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{oooohoohoo...my tenders.}
<A>__{he struggles to get on his feet, takes one step and reaches out to a dummy arm...and immediately gets pummeled all over again. po comes out the other side battered and bruised and finds he is standing on the floor that shoots out bursts of flame. we see reflections of fire on the five and shifu as po gets singed. he comes crawling into frame.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{how did i do?}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{there is now a level zero.}
