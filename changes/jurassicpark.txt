MOVING UP AND OVER this amber abstraction, the CAMERA FINDS unusual shapes and imperfections caught in the glassy stone:  flecks of dirt, hairs, cracks.  STILL MOVING.  STARBURSTS OF LIGHT ricochet off the different surfaces of the stones. CAMERA TURNS along a creamy stretch of amber.  IT TURNS IN DEEPER, abstracting the picture further only to find A TINY BLUR that suddenly RACKS INTO FOCUS - a bug, a mosquito lodged within an amber tomb.  It is folded on its back.}

<ACTION>__{as the tip of a fine-pointed drill bores into the amber toward the trapped bug.  Orange flecks fly.  The mosquito trembles.  The drill continues, stopping just before it touches the tiny body. A SHINY PAIR of thin needle-nose pliers reach in the borehole and extricate the mosquito remains.  These are dropped on a brightly lit glass slide.  A conveyor belt starts, and the slide moves along. arriving under a long-lensed microscope. IN MICROSCOPIC PERSPECTIVE, a thin needle pierces the bug and delicately removes a fragment of tissue. PINCERS snare the fragment, dropping it into a narrow tube.  The tube SPINS, faster and faster until it is a BLUR on the screen. THE SCREEN FLOODS with an INFRA-RED LIGHT.  Gray, oval shapes rock in a neutral mist.}

WIDEN OUT to a SWEEPING PANORAMA of a dinosaur dig, a major excavation filled with workers shoveling earth and stone, making measurements, taking photographs, scribbling notes, and conferring with each other. The center of all this activity is one man.  In a roped-off area that circumscribes the exposed bones of the raptor, is DR. ALAN GRANT, head paleontologist.  Good-looking, late 30's, with a think beard. Grant lies on his belly, completely absorbed in a small piece of bone. A GROUP OF TWELVE STUDENTS, notebooks in hand, await his next sentence. CLOSE ON - the tiny bone.  Grant's nose touches it. Grant brushes the bone with a toothbrush.  Then he decides on a quicker way to clean it.  He licks it.

Next to THE PILOT, Nedry chews a candy bar.  He offers candy to the back row. Grant loses himself, looking out the window. GRANT'S POV - the aquamarine blue of the ocean.  Below the waters there are the shadows of ample marine life.  Dolphins leap in the air. Suddenly the clear scene becomes obscured by clouds. There is turbulence.  Ellie wakes, glances at Grant, then out the window. There is mist and she absently traces her finger in it, shaping a dinosaur figure.

Grant leads them toward a rocky outcrop with a stand of big conifers. The animals continue to close. CLOSE ON - the running feet of the stampeding animals.  The ground VIBRATES every time it is struck by the huge feet. GRANT AND THE KIDS scramble onto the rocks.  They frantically tuck in between big boulders as the the herd reaches them.  Lex shields her dusty face with her hands as she wedges deeper between the rocks.  Grant pushes her down deeper and looks up from between the rocks. GRANT'S POV - the immense legs of the first hadrosaur to pass.  Another slams its big tail against the rocks, leaving a splash of hot blood. Stampeding legs send clods of dirt fl ying in the air.  Above, even the birds are running.  Disoriented, they fly frantically along. GRANT AND THE KIDS are enveloped in dust.  Just shadows of huge bodies with giant limbs.  BELLOWS of pain as animals wheel and circle. A boulder is dislodged and it rolls toward Timmy.  He dives out of his rocky hiding place.  The boulder continues on toward Grant and Lex. They dive after Timmy.  The group buries itself anew in a group of thick roots tangled amidst smaller rocks.  The boulder continues on, SMASHING the rocky enclave they have just left. Grant and the kids huddle and watch the last under-bellies oscillate above them.  The stampede goes past.  They lie there, unable to move. They watch the herd trample on. CLOSE ON - The Rex's foot as it crushes a motion sensor. Lex SCREAMS.  Grant and Timmy cover her mouth. The T-Rex hunts down the herd.  He targets his prey.  A young hadrosaur. As the hadrosaur gallops into the shadowy treeline, the Rex lunges fiercely.  The Rex and its victim are enveloped in dust. Grant holds Lex close.

<ACTION>__{With the raptor in hot pursuit, the kids and Grant come flying.  Tim and Lex jump over the railing, leaping onto the skeletal display.  Grant goes for the stairs, jumping down them three at a time. The raptor goes after the kids, scrambling over the balcony onto the display.  The kids scamper down the display, knocking paint cans and tools off the scaffolding as they go.  The raptor is just one beat behind, and his snar ling face is splashed with red paint as he chases. The kids burrow into the rib cage of the Rex.  They break off floating rubs and hurl them back at the raptor.  The raptor is undeterred, closing the gap on the kids. The kids are stuck at the end of the rib cage - it's closed off by the skeleton and they can't break through.  They're imprisoned.  The raptor is pushing through the rib cage, bones crackling as it goes. Grant leaps up the scaffolding, grabs a beam, swings his weight onto it, and slams it into the T-Rex's neck.  The neck shatters and the massive head of the T-Rex drops free. It falls directly onto the last raptor, squashing him flat.  Dead.}

With a huge bellow, the T-Rex comes charging at the helicopter.  THE PILOT screams for all to board as he starts to lift off. The Rex bites onto the copter skid as the copter tries to escape.  The copter angles dangerously as the Rex holds on. Ellie fires a fire-extinguisher into the furious face of the Rex and its jaws relax.  The copter escapes and starts to climb high into the sky. The Rex paws after it, then drops down to four legs and gives the copter a final swipe with its tail. The tail SWISHES through the air and CRACKS against the plexiglass windshield which fissures and pops.  The pilot struggles to maintain altitude and manages to keep the craft in the air. With a ROAR of its own, the copter breaks into the blue sky and soars. away, leaving an angry T-Rex alone.  Unnoticed by the frustrated Rex, Hammond slips away and walks into the jungle.
