<A>__{the curtain rises to reveal ping (27) at a microphone. she's as gorgeous a woman as you'll ever see. she stands with her hips turned in profile. her body is a knockout, dress cut to reveal skin. the soldiers are on their feet, whistling and hollering. up on the catwalk, edward is surprised by an enemy soldier. the two men begin to scuffle. music starts, a vampy torch song. ping sings melody while an off stage voice carries perfect harmony.}

<D>__{sometimes a girl can feel so alone without a lover to call her own. sometimes it's so bad, she wants to explode. wants to grab the first man she sees and tear off his clothes.}
<A>__{a roar from the soldiers. she knows what they want. still fighting, edward jumps for a pole on the far side of the catwalk, sliding down it to end up}
<B>__{backstage.}
<A>__{his determined opponent follows him down.}
<C>__{ping }
<D>__{but she won't. no, she can't. she needs a special special different unusual man. because that girl, who looks like me, she has wants, but she has needs.}
<C>__{ping}
<P>__{(speaking)}
<D>__{any of you got needs?}
<A>__{the soldiers roar louder, stomping on the bleachers. backstage, the two men are still fighting.}
<C>__{ping}
<P>__{(chorus)}
<D>__{i've had twice the adventure, cried double the tears. two times the bad times in half the years. i need a strong man, because i've got twice the love to give.}
<A>__{for the first time, ping turns, and now we see why she was standing in profile. ping is one half of}
<B>__{siamese twins.}
<A>__{her identical twin is jing, who's been singing harmony all this time. they are two separate women who join at the waist, one set of perfect legs beneath them. edward sees the twins from behind, does a double take. it costs him a punch to the jaw.}
<C>__{ping}
<D>__{say hello, jing.}
<C>__{jing}
<D>__{hello jing.}
<C>__{ping}
<P>__{(to the crowd)}
<D>__{i'm ping. she's jing. she's the good one.}
<P>__{(closer)}
<D>__{i'm the bad one.}
<A>__{as the music builds towards the climax, edward finishes the fight, knocking the guard out with a right hook. as ping and jing reach the last chorus, they strike a final pose in the shape of a heart, their arms forming the arches, their backs forming the curves. edward slips behind curtains, trying to get away. the soldiers are shouting for an encore, lighters waving. the curtain slowly lowers, revealing edward's parachute. the applause dies, replaced by a concerned rumble. the emcee yells for the guards to search.}

<A>__{ping has no idea what's happening. jing reaches into her cleavage to pull out her eyeglasses.}
