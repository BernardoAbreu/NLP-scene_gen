<L>__{interior county jail med. close shot}
<A>__{at the door of earl williams' cell. hildy sits on a stool at the door, pencil and copy paper in hand. earl williams sits at the edge of his cot, facing hildy. there is a bouquet of roses in a water pitcher by the cot. our first impression of williams is that he's a rational, well poised citizen. it is only under hildy's questioning that he gradually reveals himself.}
<C>__{williams}
<D>__{i couldn't plead insanity, because you see i'm just as sane as anybody else.}
<C>__{hildy}
<P>__{(puzzled and worried)}
<D>__{you didn't mean to kill that policeman?}
<C>__{williams}
<D>__{of course not. i couldn't kill anybody it's against everything i've ever stood for. they know it was an accident. they're not hanging me for that they're hanging me for my beliefs.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{what are your beliefs, earl?}
<C>__{williams}
<D>__{they're very simple. i believe in the golden rule. i'm not the first man to die for preaching it. but if they would only listen to it we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{how would you go about applying the golden rule, earl?}
<C>__{williams}
<D>__{i'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. there's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.}
<C>__{hildy}
<P>__{(writing)}
<D>__{"production for use only." well, maybe that's the answer.}
<C>__{williams}
<D>__{it's the only answer. everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. doesn't that make sense?}
<B>__{closeup hildy}
<C>__{hildy}
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{yes, that makes a lot of sense, earl.}
<C>__{william's voice}
<D>__{just use things for what they were meant, that's all.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{sure.}
<P>__{(she studies him a moment)}
<D>__{what's the purpose of a gun, earl?}
<B>__{closeup williams}
<C>__{williams}
<D>__{a gun?}
<P>__{(he thinks then a}
<D>__{revealing smile breaks}
<P>__{out)}
<D>__{why to shoot, of course.}
<B>__{med. close two shot}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{is that how you came to shoot the policeman?}
<C>__{williams}
<D>__{sure. you see, i'd never had a gun in my hand before and i didn't know what to do with it. well, when i get stuck, i know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. so it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? to shoot! so i shot. simple isn't it?}
<C>__{hildy}
<P>__{(writing)}
<D>__{very simple, earl.}
<C>__{williams}
<D>__{there's nothing crazy about that, is there?}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{no, earl, not at all.}
<P>__{(she indicates the flowers)}
<D>__{who sent you the flowers, earl?}
<C>__{williams}
<P>__{(reverently)}
<D>__{miss mollie malloy. she's a wonderful person.}
<C>__{hildy}
<P>__{(pointing to picture pinned on wall)}
<D>__{isn't that her picture?}
<C>__{williams}
<P>__{(turning toward it)}
<D>__{yes. isn't she beautiful?}
<A>__{insert: picture of mollie}
<C>__{hildy's voice}
<D>__{if you should be pardoned, are you figuring on marrying mollie?}
<C>__{earl's voice}
<D>__{oh, no, she's much too good for me.}
<C>__{hartman's voice}
<D>__{how'd you get in here?}
<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{sheriff hartman has come into the scene. hildy turns toward him.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{same way you did.}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{through that gate.}
<C>__{hartman}
<D>__{i gave strict orders that nobody was to interview williams without my permission.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{all right, then, i will just run the story that sheriff hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.}
<C>__{hartman}
<D>__{now, wait a minute! i'm not afraid of anything. what were you going to write about williams?}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{oh, nothing much. just that the state had proved he was sane and he admits it himself. if you don't want me to run it }
<C>__{hartman}
<P>__{(beaming)}
<D>__{oh, that'll be all right, hildy. go ahead, run it. and you can say i treated him well, too.}
<P>__{(turning toward williams)}
<D>__{'lo, earl. how are you feeling?}
<C>__{williams}
<D>__{fine, thanks, sheriff.}
<C>__{hartman}
<D>__{that's good, earl. oh, they've got another alienist to see you. he ought to be here any minute. don't go to sleep, will you?}
<C>__{williams}
<D>__{i won't.}
<C>__{hartman}
<P>__{(to hildy)}
<D>__{hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?}
<C>__{hildy}
<P>__{(in a low voice so}
<D>__{williams won't}
<P>__{overhear)}
<D>__{no, thanks sheriff. i'm leaving town tonight.}
<C>__{hartman}
<P>__{(just as loud as ever)}
<D>__{you ought to stay over. you always wrote a good hanging story, hildy.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{that's awful kind of you, sheriff. i've got to get started on my interview. see you later.}
<C>__{williams}
<D>__{don't forget about production for use.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{i won't, earl.}
<P>__{(she goes)}
