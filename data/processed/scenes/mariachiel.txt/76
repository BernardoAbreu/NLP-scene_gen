<L>__{interior domino's loft day}
<A>__{domino opens the door abruptly and finds mariachi taking a bath. he bolts upright, pulls a towel up from the floor and sits frozen waiting for domino's next move. she laughs and walks to the counter.}
<C>__{domino}
<P>__{(friendly)}
<D>__{i thought i told you not to touch anything.}
<C>__{mariachi}
<D>__{sorry. i needed to relax. i can...}
<C>__{domino}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{no, it's alright, finish up. do you want shampoo?}
<C>__{mariachi}
<P>__{(laying back, closed eyes)}
<D>__{yes, please.}
<A>__{domino turns to a counter and her smile fades. she looks like she wants to rip mariachi's throat out with her teeth. she puts the gun down on the counter. she finds an omnious looking knife and then grabs a bottle of shampoo. she walks over to him, then pulls the knife up to his throat with one hand while grabbing his hair with the other. he opens his eyes wide. the shampoo hits the floor and begins to roll.}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{who are you?!}
<C>__{mariachi}
<P>__{(choking)}
<D>__{i'm a musician!}
<A>__{the shampoo bottle rolls into the guitar case and stops. domino sees this, and with her foot reaches out and pulls the case toward her.}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{what do you have in here? guns? knives?}
<A>__{mariachi tries to catch his breath, pausing before answering her as if wondering if all this is really happening.}
<C>__{mariachi}
<D>__{no! my guitar!}
<A>__{domino slides her foot out of her shoe, and unsnaps one of the latches with her toe.}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{we'll see...}
<A>__{she unsnaps another. the latches snap loud and echo in the quiet room. mariachi gasps as she tightens her grip.}
<C>__{domino }
<D>__{you're very modest, mariachi...}
<A>__{she squeezes his hair and unsnaps another latch.}
<C>__{domino }
<P>__{(through gritted teeth)}
<D>__{you told me you killed four men, when you really killed seven. or were they still breathing even after you shot out their hearts?}
<A>__{another latch snaps.}
<C>__{mariachi}
<P>__{(groing dizzy)}
<D>__{i'm a mariachi...}
<A>__{snap!}
<C>__{mariachi}
<D>__{... not a murderer...}
<A>__{snap!}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{aren't you going to watch?}
<A>__{she lifts the lid with her foot. it seems an eternity before the case is fully open. domino is looking into the case, but mariachi is not. he knows what's in there.}
<C>__{mariachi}
<D>__{i told you... i am a musician.}
<A>__{slow dolly into the case, which contains a white, well kept classical guitar. domino is seeing it, and for a moment she almost believes he is telling the truth. she rushes to it, grabs the guitar and tosses it to mariachi. he catches it, choking after she releases the blade. she is on the other side of the tub, now. she jams the knife down between mariachi's legs. mariachi's eyes bug.}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{play it.}
<C>__{mariachi}
<P>__{(still choking)}
<D>__{w...w...what?}
<A>__{domino shoves the knife in deeper and mariachi grimaces horribly.}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{play it, damnit, play something sweet!!!}
<A>__{mariachi is sweating and his face is extremely red. he pauses for a long time before plucking an odd note. she squints as if she's caught him. but he eventually starts picking out a sweet little melody.}
<C>__{domino }
<P>__{(growing impatient)}
<A>__{sing! mariachi starts to sing but chokes on the words. he starts over, playing a "rancho grande" sounding song with his own made up words.}
<C>__{mariachi}
<P>__{(in a high sweet voice)}
<D>__{what is this place? that treats me like a murderer? they've all got their heads up their butts... even this beautiful girl, with a knife to my balls, should i kiss her or hit her... or both?}
<A>__{he finishes his song, bowing and thanking his imaginary audience. domino is smiling. she pulls the knife slowly out of the water and wipes it off on her apron.}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{you're a mariachi, all right. and a good one.}
<A>__{mariachi bows a solemn thank you.}
<C>__{mariachi}
<D>__{i think this is the best i've ever played. you... inspired me.}
<A>__{closeup of the knife. she laughs.}
<C>__{mariachi }
<D>__{hire me.}
<A>__{domino looks at him with a silent "what?".}
<C>__{mariachi }
<D>__{i'm good. hire me to play in your bar. i will work mostly from tips. but, i need steady work.}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{i couldn't pay you. i have no money.}
<C>__{mariachi}
<D>__{this fancy place and you have no money?}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{it's the truth.}
<C>__{mariachi}
<D>__{i will work for room and board, then. please, i'm desperate.}
<C>__{domino}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{will i have to keep a knife at your balls to get you to play like that?}
<C>__{mariachi}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{not if you're paying me room and board. please... until i find a permanent job.}
<C>__{domino}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{you won't find a permanent job in this town... but ok.}
<A>__{she gets up slowly, and turns to leave. mariachi settles back, smiling triumphantly. suddenly she darts around and slams the knife between his legs again with a furious look on her face. he bolts up out of this triumphant daze with a look of complete shock. she loosens up and laughs.}
<C>__{domino }
<D>__{you're going to need a better sense of humor than that, if you're gonna work for me, kid.}
<A>__{she flings her knife aside. it sticks into a wall. she shrugs, smiles a beautiful smile, turns, and goes downstairs. mariachi settles back down, closing his eyes. the knife slips out of the wall and clangs to the ground. mariachi jumps again, rolls his eyes, and sinks underwater as the picture fades.}
