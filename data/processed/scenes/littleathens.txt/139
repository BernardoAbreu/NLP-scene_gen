<A>__{pov on jimmy, bobby, sinjin and louie staring at the wall opposite the door. bobby is still holding what's left of louie's wheelchair. sinjin throws his hands up in disgust disbelief. we see what they're staring at kwon is climbing clumsily through the window. a large gun falls heavily to the floor and kwon falls in after it.}

<A>__{>from o.s. a chinese stress ball hits kwon in the forehead. dazed, kwon can only blink his eyes tries to gather his senses. bobby stares at kwon a moment before landing his large fist square on kwon's nose, knocking him empty handed and on his ass beside sinjin. sinjin stands up to get between bobby and kwon.}
<C>__{sinjin}
<D>__{alright everybody calm the fuck down! this shit's gettin' outta hand }
<A>__{bang! everybody freezes as the sound and smoke of a gunshot lingers, then checks to make sure they weren't hit. as doorknob starts rattling with increasing intensity, everyone checks to make sure they weren't hit, then turns to the source of the gunshot. louie is holding the gun as he lays on his side, having scrambled to grab the gun. the door bursts open it's rj, out of breath.}
