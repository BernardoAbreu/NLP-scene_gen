<T>__{we cut to:}
<A>__{the professor on the bang! and, after a sad shake of his head,}
<T>__{cut back to:}
<A>__{lump in time to see him finish toppling back over the rail. the scow horn ends.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{perhaps... it had to be thus.}
<A>__{he goes to the railing to look down. lump, face up on a pile of garbage, glides away. disturbed birds flap upward. the professor muses:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{"...lo, in yon brilliant window niche how statue like i see thee stand..."}
<A>__{his gaze rises with the ascending birds. among the white gulls is one black bird. the professor eyes it as it rises past him.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...hm. a raven?}
<B>__{from very high}
<A>__{we look down on the professor, the black bird rising to perch on the gargoyle on the suspension tower in the foreground. the bird settles on a loose, teetering piece of masonry.}
<B>__{back to the professor}
<A>__{looking at the receding red light on the bridge of the receding scow:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{"...the agate lamp within thy hand... "}
<B>__{back high}
<A>__{the teetering chunk of masonry tips away and the perchless bird flaps off.}
<B>__{back to the professor}
<A>__{very dreamy: he sees something in the distance, beyond time and space:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...ah, psyche! from the regions which are holy land!"}
<A>__{this is punctuated by the crunching impact of masonry scoring a direct hit on his head. he falls over the rail. his cape snags on the railing and he hangs limp and lifeless. directly below his dangling body the stern of lump's barge is slipping away to leave black waters and the clanking of chains. the fabric of the professor's cape begins to tear. his body drops in fits and starts as the fabric gives way. finally the body rips free. it falls away from us. as it does so the clanking chains are pulling into view the second banger a garbage barge being chain towed by the receding scow. dorr's body lands neatly on the barge. a gust of wind. the cape flaps free of the railing and is wind tossed away amidst the cawing birds. the cat, watching, blinks.}
