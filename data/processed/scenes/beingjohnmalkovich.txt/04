<A>__{the place is a mess. vivaldi blasts through cheap speakers. a small marionette stage stands in the back of the garage. the stage is lit and on it is a finely sculpted puppet version of craig. the "craig" puppet paces back and forth, wringing its hands with incredible subtlety. we see craig, above and behind the stage. he is manipulating the puppet. his fingers move fast and furious. the puppet breaks into a dance, a beautiful and intricate balletic piece. soon the puppet is leaping and tumbling through space, moves that one would think impossible for a marionette. sweat appears on the real craigs brow. his fingers move like lightning. the puppet moves faster and faster. sweat appears on the puppet's brow. we see that the sweat is being piped from a special device that the real craig controls. the craig puppet collapses on the floor of the stage. it puts its hands up to its face and weeps. craig hangs the puppet, and comes down around the front of the stage. he is heaving. he switches off the music, picks up a beer and takes a swig.}
