<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{that what you think?}
<A>__{monica shrugs.}
<C>__{quincy }
<D>__{little after you left, i told shawnee it was time to go and i drove her ass straight home. and after she told me i was the dumbest brother in the world, i took off.}
<C>__{monica}

<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{cause i don't just stick my dick in anything.}
<A>__{monica takes this in.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i was sitting in jason's ride with him kissing on me and feeling on me and it was really bugging me cause i couldn't remember how many offensive boards i had in the championship. and then i guess she got tired of me sort of accidentally kneeing him in the balls.}
<A>__{beat, then quincy cracks up. monica laughs with him.}
<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{four.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{you had four offensive rebounds.}
<A>__{monica stares at him, surprised. she thinks.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{hold up for a second.}
<A>__{monica disappears back inside. beat, then she re appears. she climbs out her window, drops down. quincy looks at her. she holds out the envelope from usc.}
<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{when'd you get this?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{it was on my bed when i came in.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{can you just...?}
<C>__{quincy}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you sure?}
<A>__{monica nods. quincy takes the envelope, sits down on the grass. monica sits down beside him. he tears open the envelope and pulls out the letter. monica stares at him as he reads, trying to see an answer in his face. quincy finally looks up. expressionless.}
<C>__{quincy }
<D>__{damn girl...}
<A>__{monica's face falls. and then, a slow smile spreads across quincy's face.}
<C>__{quincy }
<D>__{they want you.}
<A>__{monica grabs the letter, reads. her head just drops as a tidal wave of relief washes over her. quincy smiles.}
<C>__{quincy }
<D>__{congratulations.}
<A>__{monica looks up, cheesing.}
<C>__{quincy }
<D>__{i'm gonna be there, too. i'm announcing tomorrow.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i knew it.}
<A>__{monica can't contain her excitement. without thinking, she gives quincy a kiss. they pull away, then break into nervous laughter.}
<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{what was that about?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i know, right?}
<A>__{but they both want more. they lean in, kiss deeply. they fall back on the grass. and kiss. and kiss. suddenly, monica pulls away, sits up. quincy follows, instantly apologetic. monica stares at him, then to his surprise, she reaches over, gives his shirt a small tug with her finger. quincy stares at her, then slowly pulls off his tie. he nervously unbuttons his shirt. he fumbles with the last two buttons. monica slowly pulls down the straps of her dress, self conscious. quincy can't keep his eyes off her. he pulls off his pants. monica glances down and her eyes widen. she looks scared to death. quincy smiles softly, leans in and gently kisses her. she relaxes. they lay down. quincy reaches into his pants for a condom. his hands shake as he puts it on. they stare at each other as he moves on top of her. quincy pushes inside her. she flinches back in pain. quincy immediately stops as tears spring to her eyes.}
<C>__{quincy}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{you want to stop?}
<A>__{monica shakes her head. quincy pushes inside again. he looks down at her with tenderness, moves gently, kisses her tears...}
