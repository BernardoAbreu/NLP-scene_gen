<L>__{interior damaskino's lair night}
<A>__{a crescent shaped room filled with antiquities: quarry columns from middle kingdom egypt, stacks of arcane volumes, medieval frontispieces. a borgia esque renaissance portrait staring down at us with a severe gaze. towering over all of these is a massive greek cross carved from stone. music echoes around them boito's faust. standing in the midst of this is overlord eli damaskinos, wearing a robe of black silk.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{father }
<A>__{damaskinos holds up his hand. he waits for the music to crescendo, then turns, his face still hidden in shadow.}
<C>__{damaskinos}
<D>__{i hope you don't mind the cold. when one such as myself reaches an advanced age, certain precautions are needed in order to preserve the flesh.}
<C>__{asad}
<D>__{blade, this is overlord eli damaskinos.}
<C>__{damaskinos}
<P>__{(in vampire dialect; subtitled)}
<D>__{welcome, daywalker. i thank you for coming. i've been anxious to meet you for quite some time.}
<A>__{damaskinos draws closer now, stepping into the light. bright eyed with smile like moonlight gleaming off a knife blade. his skin is impossibly pale, almost marble like, with traceries of blue blood pulsing underneath.}
<C>__{damaskinos }
<D>__{and the late abraham whistler. i trust your time amongst our numbers was agreeable?}
<A>__{whistler glares at damaskinos. the two men stare at each other a moment, sizing one another up.}
<C>__{damaskinos }
<P>__{(smiling knowingly)}
<D>__{it has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise. be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too. in that regard, i should thank you.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{stevens }
<D>__{eliminating deacon frost.}
<A>__{carter stevens, an officious looking familiar who has been quietly watching from the wings now steps forward.}
<C>__{stevens }
<D>__{all that unseemly business with lamagra. you did us a favor.}
<P>__{(offering his hand to blade)}
<D>__{carter stevens.}
<A>__{as blade and stevens shake, blade notices a vampire glyph poking out from beneath the familiar's shirt cuff.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{you're human.}
<C>__{stevens}
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{barely. i'm a lawyer.}
<C>__{asad}
<D>__{mr. stevens works with the national institute of health.}
<P>__{(off blade's look)}
<D>__{given that they monitor the nation's blood supply, a strategic alliance seemed prudent.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{we also finance a number of humanitarian organizations the national institute of infectious diseases for one, the human genome project...}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{survival.}
<A>__{blade and the others turn to nyssa, who uses a complex mechanical key to activate a holo projector mounted above the table. as she focuses the image, a 3 d diorama of vampire viral nucleocapsids swirls into view. the nucelocapsids begin attacking human red blood cells.}
<C>__{nyssa }
<D>__{as you may know, vampirism is an arbovirus, one that's spread through the saliva of parasitic organisms }
<P>__{(motioning to the hologram)}
<D>__{in this case, vampires are the vector. the virus replicates within the human bloodstream, evolving its host into an entirely new life form.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{unfortunately, viruses evolve too }
<A>__{as nyssa talks, one of the viral nucleocapsids changes, mutating from its original, elegant design into a harsher, more menacing form. the mutated nucleocapsid begins feeding on the original vampire capsids, causing a chain reaction of mutation. in seconds, the holo image is filled with throbbing, microscopic horrors which then mutate into }
<C>__{nyssa }
<D>__{we've dubbed this new virus the reaper strain. and like any good pathogen, it appears to have found a carrier a "patient zero".}
<A>__{a rotating 3 d image of jared nomak's face. eyes red, his skin in full "blood mode" blush.}
<C>__{nyssa }
<D>__{his name is jared nomak.}
<C>__{damaskinos}
<D>__{thiavolos, as we used to say in greece. the devil. pure thirst. nothing more. he was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.}
<P>__{(to blade)}
<D>__{like you. unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{seems like he's doing me a favor, then.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{you're missing the pointerior their vampire victims don't die. they turn. they become carriers. if the reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over. do the math.}
<A>__{blade turns to damaskinos.}
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(vampire dialect; subtitled)}
<D>__{you want me to hunt them for you.}
<C>__{damaskinos}
<P>__{(vampire dialect; subtitled)}
<D>__{not alone.}
<C>__{asad}
<D>__{we've been training a small tactical unit the bloodpack. we want you to lead them.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{just how long has this little social club of yours been together?}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{two years.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{no. they've been training to hunt you.}
