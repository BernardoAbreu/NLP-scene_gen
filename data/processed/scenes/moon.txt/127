<C>__{overmeyers}
<D>__{we've managed to secure you a rescue unit ahead of schedule.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{rescue unit eliza.}
<A>__{a shot still photo of rescue unit eliza. a meaner group of sons of bitches you have never seen. these guys make the rescue team from apocalypse now look like the new kids on the block.}
<C>__{overmeyers}
<D>__{they've been stationed on goliath 19 for the last couple of months.}
<C>__{thompson }
<D>__{eliza's been in transit for the last day....we expect them to reach you in approximately 14 hours.}

<D>__{a hooker!}
<C>__{overmeyers}
<D>__{no not a hooker. what's wrong with you? it's a little something to drink, sam, that's all, our way of patting you on the back for all that you've been through.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{in the meantime, keep resting up, and hang in there.}
<C>__{overmeyers}
<D>__{yeah you hang in there, sam. over and out.}
<A>__{and the screen pops to black. a pause. for a moment there is silence, neither of the sams knowing how to react going by the message thompson and overmeyers don't know anything about there being two sams on the base now.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{they're sending a rescue unit? why?}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{to fix the stalled harvester. they didn't think i was up to it.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{then i'm going back.}
<A>__{sam 2 gives sam 1 a perplexed look.}
<C>__{sam 1 }
<D>__{i've done my three years. that's it for me }
<A>__{sam 2 is shaking his head slowly.}
<C>__{sam 1 }
<D>__{what?}

<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{i've got a contract }
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{you're a fucking clone! you don't have shit!}
<A>__{at once sam 1 and sam 2 rocket to their feet right in each others faces, on the brink of blows.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{i'm going home!}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{you're not going anywhere!}
<A>__{sam 1 turns around, heads out of the room. sam 2 storms after him, talking the whole time }
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{you've been up here too long, man! you've lost the plot!}
<A>__{gerty shuttles along after them.}
