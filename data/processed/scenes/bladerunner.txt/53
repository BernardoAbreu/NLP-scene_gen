<L>__{interior deckard's apartment night}
<A>__{he slips on the light and crosses the front room. deckard is a pack rat hard to tell if he just moved in or is just moving out. as he enters the kitchen, the sound of somebody behind him causes him to whirl around fast, hand snapped out in front of him, gun already in it. rachael almost got shot. but she's unruffled, a little pale maybe, but direct as ever. there's a long, chilly moment, then she almost smiles as her eyes move to the plate on the floor.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{was that your dinner?}
<A>__{deckard looks down at the over turned plate and nods.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i called and found out you were on your way home. these were already delivered to your department but i thought you should have copies as soon as possible.}
<A>__{she's holding out a cassette the size of a cigarette pack. but it's taking deckard's adrenalin time to recede.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{it's the nexus information you wanted.}
<A>__{he takes the cassette, but a man with so many locks must be wondering how they were gotten through so easily. he doesn't even want to ask.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{he realizes he's still got the gun aimed at her and sticks it back in his belt and they're left staring at each other. the situation makes awkward silence. at least for him. she's looking at him like she's got something to say but isn't saying it.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{is there anything else?}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{i know you think it complicates your work, but i'm here to help.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i've already got more help than i need.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{i think you need more help than you've got.}
<A>__{he doesn't, but she's not backing off.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{there's two reasons a man rejects help. either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{sounds like i'm an ass hole either way, but the answer is still no.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{two of us might be more effective than one.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i work alone.}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{no you don't.}
<A>__{she lets it sink in.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{you use your equipment, don't you?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{so, i'm a piece of equipment. use me.}
<A>__{it's a strong look that passes between them a long one. maybe if he were on firmer ground he might do something about such an offer but... deckard's eyes follow her down as rachael bends to the floor and starts picking the food off the rug, put ting it back on the plate.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{that's okay, i will get it...}
<A>__{he bends down to help, but she's already done it. their heads a few inches apart. something in her eyes diminishes the distance even more.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{do i make you nervous?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{and she is. and suddenly he is too. she hands him the plate and they stand. she's looking at the floor, almost shy, then she looks up and he's watching her. she says it plain and simple.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{it's strange to suddenly realize that what you thought was your life is actually someone else's fabrication.}
<A>__{deckard nods. he feels it, but doesn't know what to do about it.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i can imagine.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{can you? i couldn't.}
<A>__{these are not some of deckard's finer moments. but she doesn't seem to notice.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{a part of me is glad. i think i feel more. i don't like who i was before.}
<A>__{deckard nods, waits the respectable interval and is glad to have a plate to take into the kitchen. in the scrambled sanctuary of his kitchen deckard looks around for a place to put the plate, but things have piled up on him in here. he contemplates the refrig erator.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{so why do you think they were after their records.}
<A>__{he's a lot more comfortable talking shop.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{they probably want to find out when they were made.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{he dumps his dinner in the garbage and comes back out. she's writing something on a card.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{i guess the date of your birth is important if you know you're not made to last.}
<A>__{no way he can keep his foot out of it. she looks up and hands him the card.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{that's my number. if you need me.}
<A>__{she goes to the door, opens it but hesitates before going through.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{you better get better locks if you want to keep me out.}
<A>__{she looks back at him and smiles the smile says she's talking about all kinds of locks. deckard looks like he might ask her to stay, but...}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{and she's gone.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{night.}
<A>__{he looks down at the number. it's the back side of a snapshot. he turns it over. the picture of a man and a woman. the little girl between them looks like a six year old rachael.}
