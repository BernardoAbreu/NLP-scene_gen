<L>__{interior police interview room day}
<A>__{suzie, gloria and hunter sit at the conference table. ray operates the video cam.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{okay, suzie. we want you to tell us about the day mr. lombardo gave you and jimmy a ride.}
<A>__{suzie stares at the three cops around her, then at the camera.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{you didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{we need to tape the interview, suzie. no one will see it but us.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now when was this, that mr. lombardo gave you the ride?}
<A>__{suzie stares at the camera. she's lost the cockiness she had on her own turf. she looks small, white and frail in the sterile room, surrounded by the detectives.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{about a year ago.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{he dropped jimmy off first?}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{and when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{so you were alone.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{did he come in with you?}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{i guess.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{you guess? did he or didn't he?}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{yeah... okay... he did}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{and then what... he touched you? did you maybe flirt a little...}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{i wanna go home now.}
<A>__{gloria glares at hunter, shakes her head.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{suzie, look, i know you feel bad. i know it's harder to talk here than in your room, but we need to get it on tape.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{just tell us what you told us before. tell us the truth.}
<A>__{suzie huddles in her skinny arms, studying the detectives.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{i didn't say a thing to him. he just put his arm around me. told me i was pretty... i could be really pretty, he said.}
<A>__{another moment she looks at ray, then at hunter.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{what did you do then?}
<C>__{suzie}
<P>__{(a long beat)}
<D>__{shit, what difference does it make... nobody's gonna believe me anyway...}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{suzie! did this man rape you?}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{okay! he did. he pushed me to the floor and he did it to me. now, can i go home?}
<A>__{she stands up.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{at that point were you able to fight him off?}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{no. he stopped by himself. okay? that's all. let me go.}
<A>__{gloria gets to her feet as well; she tries to put an arm around suzie. the girl jumps back as if she has been shocked.}
<C>__{suzie }
<D>__{don't touch me.}
<A>__{gloria's hands fall to her sides. suzie heads for the door. the detectives exchange looks. at which point, suzie stops, turns to face the room.}
<C>__{suzie }
<D>__{he did say something.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{he said, "no little bitch can ever make me come."}
<B>__{the sliding bar door}
<A>__{of a jail slams shut on sam lombardo. he turns to... two menacing prisoners.}
<C>__{prisoner}
<D>__{so you're the new chicken licker.}
