<A>__{the brownstone looks a lot better than when we last saw it. graffiti's been removed, the stairs have been repaired, the windows have security bars, and there are flowers blooming in pots in front of the building. roberta steps into frame, walking allegra, now a 10 year old dog.}
<L>__{interior brownstone day}
<A>__{the house is transformed: the first floor is one long open room with oak floors, a living room in front with a beautiful fireplace and a grand piano, and a country kitchen in the rear, complete with pots hanging over a large butcher block. nick (17) practices cello and lexi (15) practices piano; they play haydn's "trio #13." now handsome young men, their blonde hair has darkened to brown. nick is huskier; lexi has a slighter build. both are passionate, talented musicians. on the couch, rachel (12), a mature, beautiful black girl, rosins her bow.}
