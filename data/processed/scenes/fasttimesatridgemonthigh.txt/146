<A>__{brad hamilton pushes both doors open, and makes his entrance into the last dance. there is a lot of activity going on, but all nearby eyes turn to brad as he walks into the dance. fifteen kids immediately gravitate towards him. they all want brad to sign their annuals, to talk about the 7 11 incident. onstage, the t birds play the beatles' "it won't be long". we see brad's old girlfriend lisa push up to him. her new jock boyfriend holds a protective arm around her.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i saw your picture in the paper. you had the greatest look on your face!}
<C>__{another student}
<D>__{front of the metro section. i'm telling my parents, 'i know this guy, i know this guy.'}
<A>__{lisa's boyfriend pulls his arm tighter around her.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{will you sign my annual, brad?}
<A>__{brad smiles, nods. he signs, and gives her his. we then see brad's three buddies from carl's jr. come up, pat him on the back and grab his shoulder. brad studies them warily.}
<D>__{buddy #1 fuckin' manager of 7 11! buddy #2 get us jobs over there, brad! you can do it!}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{since when do you guys want to work at 7 11? buddy #2 come on, brad! it would be great! all of us together!}

<A>__{brad leaves his old buddies. he grins and notices someone across the crowded dance floor.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{hey, thompson! wendell! get a job!}
<A>__{they laugh, flip him off. brad is back in his element at last. he moves into the main dancing area, works his way across the room, past the bleachers, when he hears a voice.}
<C>__{spicoli }
<D>__{hamilton!}
<A>__{brad turns around, seen spicoli sitting on the bottom rung of the bleachers. spicoli looks back with true respect.}
<C>__{spicoli }

<C>__{spicoli }

<B>__{angle on the bleachers}
<A>__{where several couples are passionately making out. four teachers clomp up into the stands from different angles. they pin the couples in flashlight beams, like the main tower pinning an escaping prisoner. angle on the t birds onstage, singing the rolling stones' "i'm free".}
