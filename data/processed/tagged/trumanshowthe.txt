<L>__{interior a womb. day.}
<A>__{a fiber optic camera observes a five month old male fetus as he gently floats, weightless, suspended in the amniotic fluid of his mother's womb. we focus on the unborn's hand, already a tiny, exquisite work of art, moving towards his newly formed lips. he sucks his thumb.}
<L>__{interior hospital delivery room. day.}
<A>__{a seconds old baby boy umbilical cord still attached, smeared with blood and protective skin grease is held up by an anonymous pair of latex gloves to the camera. shocked by the unaccustomed light and cool of the delivery room, the newborn fights for his first, arduous breath. following almost immediately, a cry. from another angle we see the crying infant on a television screen, the individual lines of the screen clearly visible.}
<T>__{match dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior car utopia, queens. morning.}
<A>__{the face of the baby thirty four years later, still crying. truman burbank, thinning hair, a body going soft around the edges, appearing older than his thirty four years sits at the wheel of his eight year old oldsmobile cutlass supreme. he cries without shame, making no attempt to wipe away the tears. pausing at an intersection in a quiet, working class suburban street, a spherical glass object suddenly falls from the sky and lands with a deafening crash on the roadway, several yards in front of his idling car. truman exits the oldsmobile to investigate. amidst a sea of shattered glass are the remains of a light mechanism. he looks around him but the street is deserted. he checks that all the surrounding streetlights are accounted for, even though the fallen fixture is far larger. he looks up into the sky but there is no plane in sight. with some effort, truman picks up what's left of the crumpled light, loads it into the trunk of his car and drives away.}
<L>__{interior car train station parking lot. morning.}
<A>__{truman sits behind the wheel of his car, unscrews the cap of a miniature bottle of jack daniels and empties the contents into his styrofoam cup of coffee. stirring it in with his finger, he burns himself.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{as truman drinks, he becomes aware of the delighted squeals of children coming from the gymnasium of utopia elementary school, adjacent to the parking lot. the sound of the children triggers a memory in his head.}
<L>__{exterior long, wide beach. day, twenty seven years earlier.}
<A>__{unlike a conventional flashback, the scene in his memory appears to be playing on a television screen. a sandy haired, seven year old truman, runs towards a bluff on the beach. the boy's father, kirk, late thirties, beer bottle in hand, flirts with two teenage girls at the shoreline. suddenly, the father remembers his son. he looks anxiously around. the sight of the boy at the far end of the beach causes him to drop his bottle in the sand and run to him. the boy is near the top of the cliff before his agitated father comes within earshot.}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(out of breath, clutching his side)}
<D>__{truman! truman! stop!}
<A>__{truman turns from his perch and waves happily down to his father. but the smile quickly vanishes when he registers the anger and distress on his father's face.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{come down now!}
<A>__{his father's unnatural anxiety makes the next bay even more tantalizing. the boy considers defying his father. he puts his hand on the rock above him to stretch up and sneak a peek at the other side. one good stretch would do it.}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(reading truman's mind, enraged)}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(sensing his father is keeping something from him)}
<D>__{why? what's there?}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(unconvincing)}
<D>__{nothing's there. it's the same as this.}
<P>__{(trace of desperation)}
<D>__{come down, please!}
<A>__{truman is suddenly aware that the hundreds of other beachgoers have stopped their activities to stare at him. reluctantly he starts to retrace his steps down the rocks. when he finally jumps to the sand, his father grabs him roughly by the arm and drags him away down the beach.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{i told you to stay close. don't ever leave my sight again. you gotta know your limitations. you could've been washed away by the tide.}
<L>__{exterior lower manhattan, financial district. morning.}
<A>__{truman emerges from a subway exit in lower manhattan and walks briskly down the bustling street. a snarl of taxis, buses and commuter traffic. a street vendor thrusts a pretzel under truman's nose, a career woman catches his eye. truman stops at a newspaper stand and plucks an issue of cosmopolitan from the rack, quickly flicking through the glossy pages. glancing in the direction of the newspaper vendor and finding him busy with another customer, truman deftly tears a portion of the open page and pockets the cutting. he guiltily replaces the magazine, startled to find the newspaper vendor standing close behind him.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(quickly recovering)}
<D>__{gimme a copy of "the sydney morning herald".}
<C>__{vendor}
<D>__{we ran out.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(hastily departing)}
<D>__{thanks anyway.}
<A>__{as truman hurries away, the vendor picks up the copy of cosmo and instantly turns to the torn page. it is a lancome advertisement with isabella rossellini's nose missing. truman is still in view but the vendor makes no effort to confront him, almost as if he were expecting it. passing one of the tall, black mirrored buildings that grow out of the pavement, truman glimpses himself in the reflective glass. he doesn't like what he sees and attempts to suck in his gut, but quickly concedes defeat. the image triggers another childhood memory.}
<L>__{interior schoolroom. day, twenty seven years earlier.}
<A>__{once again, the flashback appears to be playing on a television screen. the sandy haired seven year old truman sits in the middle row of a catholic elementary school classroom surrounded by thirty or so other well scrubbed, uniformed youngsters. douglas, the boy next to truman is on his feet under the scrutiny of a sixty year old nun with a face as wrinkled as her habit is starched.}
<C>__{douglas}
<D>__{i wanna be a chiropractor like my dad.}
<C>__{sister}
<P>__{(impressed)}

<C>__{sister}
<D>__{that's right, douglas.}
<P>__{(holding her back, hamming it up)}
<D>__{perhaps i will be your first patient.}
<A>__{the class titters. douglas sits down, pleased with himself, throwing a smirk to truman.}
<C>__{sister}
<D>__{what about you, truman?}
<A>__{truman rises to his feet.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{i want to be an explorer}
<P>__{(with reverence)}
<D>__{...like magellan.}
<A>__{the sister's face falls.}
<C>__{sister}
<D>__{no one's going to pay you to do that, truman.}
<P>__{(with scarcely disguised glee)}
<D>__{besides, you're too late. there's nothing left to explore.}
<A>__{the class roars with laughter and truman takes his seat.}
<L>__{exterior lower manhattan, financial district. morning.}
<A>__{from truman's pov we see that he is staring up at relief letters that proclaim, "american life & accident insurance, inc." above an office building's entrance. a police officer walking his beat, wanders in truman's direction. from another angle, we observe truman from the police officer's pov shaky, handheld camera on a television screen. truman enters the building.}
<L>__{interior insurance company twelfth floor. day.}
<A>__{in a cramped, cluttered, windowless cubicle, truman talks on the telephone.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(into receiver)}
<D>__{...okay, okay, let's call it what it is... i'm not gonna lie to you...life insurance is death insurance...you just gotta ask yourself two questions... one, in the event of your death, will anyone experience financial loss?...and two, do you care?}
<A>__{a clerk drops a large reference book on truman's desk. he checks the spine "mortality statistics, 1986 to present".}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(into receiver)}
<D>__{hold on will ya?}
<P>__{(to clerk, putting receiver to chest, referring to the book)}
<D>__{this's no good. lumps all drownings together. i need drownings broken down by category.}
<A>__{the clerk shrugs, returns the book to his trolley and continues his rounds.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(returning to his call)}
<D>__{...just think about what i've been saying and lemme...hello?...}
<A>__{the person on the other end has hung up. with an apathetic shrug, truman replaces the receiver. he looks over his shoulder and places another call.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(lowering his voice)}
<D>__{can you connect me with directory inquiries in sydney, australia?}
<P>__{(a long delay makes truman even more uncomfortable)}
<D>__{...er, yes. do you have a listing for a lauren powers...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{...nothing listed?...what about a sylvia powers...nothing? thanks...}
<A>__{truman replaces the receiver, disappointed.}
<L>__{interior local italian deli. lunchtime.}
<A>__{truman stands in line with a crush of other white collar workers. as he reaches the counter, the store owner, tyrone, has anticipated his order and ahs already begun preparing a meatball and mozzarella sandwich on italian roll. truman gazes at the sandwich skillfully under construction, pained by his own predictability.}
<C>__{tyrone}
<P>__{(nauseatngly cheerful)}

<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(deadpan)}

<D>__{tyrone, what if i said i didn't want meatball today?}
<C>__{tyrone}
<P>__{(not missing a beat)}
<D>__{i'd ask for identification.}
<A>__{truman forces a half smile. we focus on another male office worker in line at the cash register, watching truman out of the corner of his eye. about to depart with his sandwich, the man receives a guarded rebuke from the female cashier.}
<C>__{female cashier}
<P>__{(a whisper to prevent truman overhearing)}
<D>__{he's right there.}
<A>__{you're supposed to pay}
<D>__{when he's here.}
<C>__{male customer}
<P>__{(nonchalant shrug as he departs)}

<D>__{hold on, truman. i got somethin' to show ya.}
<A>__{tyrone holds up a front page of the new york post that features a photograph of a scaled down replica of columbus' santa maria, moored in front of the manhattan skyline. truman's eyes widen at the photograph.}

<C>__{tyrone}
<D>__{see ya tomorrow, truman.}
<L>__{exterior city park. day.}
<A>__{truman eats lunch alone on a concrete bench in a cement park. from his briefcase he pulls out an old hardcovered book, "to the ends of the earth the age of exploration". a transient in a wheelchair approaches, looking for a handout. truman gives the homeless man half of his sandwich, reconsiders and gives him it all, his appetite gone. as the transient wheels himself away, truman loses himself in his book.}
<L>__{interior a dimly lit room somewhere. day.}
<A>__{close up on an old man's face. christof. hair pure white, late sixties, a vitality in his eyes that belies his years. he stands beside a floor to ceiling window in a dimly lit room. outside the window, a single palm tree swaying against a deep blue californian sky. a news anchor style earpiece disappears down the neck of the unconventionally cut suit he wears. suspended from the ceiling above his head is a television monitor upon which a surveillance picture of truman, engrossed in his book, silently plays. chloe, twenty something, androgenous looking, similarly suited, joins christof at the window.}
<C>__{christof}
<P>__{(never taking his eyes from the monitor)}
<D>__{you ever pass a car wreck on the side of the road? they're pulling out a body. you know you shouldn't look, but you do.}

<A>__{a group of a dozen men and women of varying ages sit around a circular conference table in a sterile, windowless meeting room. all stare at a single telephone placed in the center of the table, anticipating a call. on cue, the phone rings and one of the men, after waiting for the second ring, picks up.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{hello?...i'm sorry, i got more than enough insurance.}
<A>__{he hangs up. after a moment the phone rings again.}
<L>__{interior insurance company. day.}
<A>__{truman sits at his desk, making a cold call.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(into receiver)}
<D>__{...this isn't about insurance, this is about the great variable when will death occur? could be a week, a month, a year. could happen today...a sunbather, minding his own business, gets stabbed in the heart by the tip of a runaway beach umbrella...no way you can guard against that kinda thing, no way at all...}
<A>__{the prospect on the other end, unimpressed with his pitch, hangs up. truman's supervisor, lawrence, younger than truman by several years, sharper suit, sharper haircut, appears around the corner of the cubicle.}

<L>__{interior municipal ferry terminal. day.}
<A>__{truman, briefcase in hand, ashen faced, stands in line for the staten island ferry. as the tourists and commuters impatiently brush past him onto the boat, truman remains frozen to the spot, mesmerized by the scummy water rising and falling beneath the dock, triggering a flashback in his head.}
<L>__{exterior long island sound. dusk, twenty seven years earlier.}
<A>__{the flashback once again appearing an a television screen, the seven year old truman sits alongside his father, kirk, in a small sailing dinghy.}

<A>__{truman turns and begins to fight his way back against the tide of passengers boarding the ferry, emerging back on the street into the bright sunlight, gasping for air. gathering himself, he makes for the entrance of whitehall street subway station. two commuters surrepticiously observe truman as he departs.}

<L>__{interior condominium. day.}
<A>__{a middle aged concierge behind a reception desk, is having his hair brushed by a younger man in his mid thirties. anticipating truman's arrival, the hairdresser fusses one more time and swiftly departs through a rear door. truman enters the lobby and approaches the concierge, trying to keep his arms tightly at his sides to hide the perspiration.}

<A>__{the woman picks up her bag from the floor in a reflex and holds it to her. she looks around the train for assistance, briefly catching truman's eye. the youths also look in truman's direction, staring him down, daring him to interfere. truman quickly averts his gaze.}

<P>__{(reaching for the book)}
<D>__{please...}
<A>__{the boy returns the book to the woman, but before doing so rips out the last page from the novel and stuffs it in his shirt pocket.}

<D>__{now you're gonna have to ask me how it ends.}
<A>__{the train pulls into a deserted station. feeling vulnerable, the woman jumps up from her seat and exits. the youths, sensing a chase, also exit. scanning the empty platform, the woman realizes she has made a serious error. truman watches through the train's open door as the boys corner the frightened woman but still he remains in his seat.}
<C>__{youth 1}
<D>__{we're gonna tell you how it ends, baby.}

<A>__{the woman's second scream is muffled as the train door closes. truman looks up to the emergency handle beside the door. there is still time to act. he stands up and half reaches for the handle but moves no further. the train abruptly pulls away, leaving truman time to see one of the youths covering the woman's mouth while the other reaches under her skirt before the train enters the tunnel. truman bows his head in shame as the train rattles on.}
<L>__{interior subway station. day.}
<A>__{the train safely out of sight, the youths promptly release the woman. she calmly hitches down her skirt, no longer afraid. the young men, no longer angry, help fix her hair and retrieve her shoulder bag.}

<A>__{truman appears to be losing his fight against the storm, each successive breaker taking its toll on his body, sapping his strength, his bindings the only thing holding him upright, his head slumps, the wheel goes loose in his grasp, spinning out of control. his will, draining away. as he is about to be overcome by the next wave, he thrusts his arm into the handles of the spinning wheel. he cries out in pain at the blow to his forearm but succeeds in halting the wheel. he braces for one last wave. but the wave does not come. a strange phenomenon is occurring in the ocean. a distinct division has appeared in the ocean swell. between the large rolling waves lies a corridor of calmer water, several hundred yards wide, a curious escape lane. the wind and the rain are also subsiding, the darkness lifting. truman steers his vessel down this "sea lane". after some time, several large, dark shapes emerge on the horizon. land? islands? as truman steers towards the nearest shape, he discovers what is behind the peculiar wave formations. it is certainly not the moon. the dark shape is a huge iron roller, only half of which is exposed above the surface of the sea. the ocean swell is being caused by the roller slowly turning, mechanically driven on either end by massive steel arms pumping from the sea bed. in fact there are rollers spaced four hundred yards apart in both directions along the horizon as far as the eye can see, the calm sea lanes formed by the gaps between the rollers. truman's boat is dwarfed by the gigantic machines. the exposed half of each roller, the height of a ten story building, its length equivalent to several football fields. the massive arms perpetually churn. truman's face is thrown into shadow as the boat slips quietly past the giant rotating drum. the water beyond the rollers is dead calm. truman stares ahead desperately trying to focus his eyes. but if the sight of the wave machines was difficult to comprehend, it pales in comparison with the next sight that greets him. his boat is drifting inexorably, on a slow collision course with the sky. that infinitely receding horizon line recedes no more. the sea really does meet the sky. the join is only too apparent. looming above him out of the sea is a cyclorama of colossal dimensions. the sky is nothing but a painted backdrop. truman looks upward, straining his eyes to see the top of the sky, but it curves away at a steep angle beyond his sight. the bow of the boat comes to rest against the sky, bumping gently into its latex surface. truman unties his bindings and stumbles across the deck to the side rail. clinging to the rail with one hand, he tentatively reaches out towards the painted cyclorama. he touches the sky. he feels the surface, puts both terrified hands against it. hie eyes well up with tears. he presses his distraught face into it. he screams at the top of his voice. no words. a primal scream. a pained, animal howl.}

<A>__{the two old women in the living room, the nightwatchmen, the two young men with the watchman tv, the patrons in the bar, passers by outside an electronics store are all captivated by their television sets. we focus on the screen of a television. a small female baby sucks a toy on a blanket in the backyard of truman's old suburban home in queens, the lawn he mowed for ten years of his life. the infant's doting parents, marlon and the new actress vivien, enter frame and begin to fuss over the child. a border around the action on the screen announces, "zoe total record of a human life". suddenly we see a child's hand on top of the television screen. a baby stands unsteadily, supporting herself against the television set in sylvia's house. truman bends down and picks up his baby, tossing her into the air, much to the child's delight. truman dwells for a moment on the mirror image scene on the television before very deliberately shutting it off. sylvia joins truman and their daughter. together, they exit the beach house. we follow them as they make their way onto the deserted sand and down towards the sea.}
