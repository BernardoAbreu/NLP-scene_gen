<A>__{the car stops. clyde keeps shooting. the door of the cabin flies open and bonnie and c.w. come charging out, guns blazing away. c.w. fires the thompson sub machine gun, bonnie fires two pistols with automatic clips. they run in a crouch, tryingto get inside the car in front of their door. they make it. camera pans across the motel to the other door. it opens, buck and blanche come out, holding a double bed mattress in front of them for protection. this makes their running awkward the mattress is heavy. blanche carries the front end, buck the back with one hand, the other firing his gun. they get halfway to the car and then buck is hit, shot in the head. he falls to the ground; blanche and the mattress fall too since she has lost balance. both are under the mattress. clyde dashes out of the car and drags buck into the back seat. blanche follows, hysterical. all guns on all sides are still firing. they fling themselves into the car and from a standing start, the car starts out at 60 mph down the driveway. one of the lawmen stands blocking the way with a double barrele rifle, but the car keeps coming, about to run him down. he jumps out of the way and fires at the side. the glass cracks and we see blanche fling a hand to her face, which is bloody. a piece of glass has lodged in her eye. we hear her scream. the horn is still blasting.}
