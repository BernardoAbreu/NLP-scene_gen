<L>__{interior tomb day}
<A>__{broussard is standing on a dusty stone floor, with a feeble column of sunlight shining down around him from the tunnel above. around is solid darkness. he flashes his datastick around. the beam reveals that he is in a stone room. strange heiroglyphics are carved into the walls. they have a primitive, religious appearance. row after row of pictograms stretch from floor to ceiling, some epic history in an unknown language. huge religious symbols dominate one wall. spaced at intervals are stylized stone statues, depicting grotesque monsters, half anthropoid, half octopus.}

<D>__{it's unbelievable! it's like some kind of tomb... some primitive religion! hey, is anybody there? do you read me? standard!}
<A>__{annoyed, broussard yanks off his breathing goggles, and leaves them hanging around his neck. he takes a deep breath of the wet air.}
