<A>__{chuck walks aimlessly down the beach, feeling the burden of starting over. the beach is littered with seaweed and flotsam, bits of rope, plastic bottles. he picks up a plastic bottle. that will come in handy. the chuck sees a soccer ball with "wilson" stamped on it in big black letters. he picks it up, holds it, tosses it up in the air. then he kicks it, then kicks it again, then runs down the beach, trying to kick it and keep it out of the water. feeling joy again, even here.}
