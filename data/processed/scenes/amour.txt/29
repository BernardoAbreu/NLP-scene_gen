<L>__{interior bathroom hallway annex day}
<A>__{bathroom. georges, in pajama pants, naked torso, brushes his teeth. the doorbell rings. georges spits out, wipes his mouth, goes into the hallway and over to the front door.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{yes? who's there?}
<A>__{no answer. georges is very irritated. o.s., anne calls to}
<T>__{him:}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{georges? what's going on? who is it?}
<A>__{georges opens the door. outside, however, instead of the usual landing, we see an empty room lit a giorno but without a window, about as large as the rooms in the apartment. it looks like an unpainted room in a new apartment. a couple of ladders are propped against the opposite wall. at the other end of the room, to the side, is a small door. georges is stunned, and doesn't understand what has happened. hesitating, he crosses the room toward the door. o.s., in the distance, anne's worried voice:}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{georges? what's going on?}
<A>__{georges opens the small door. behind it is a narrow, windowless corridor, as brightly lit as the room. at the end of the corridor, a door. georges heads toward this door and opens it too. behind it is a tiny windowless room, equally bright as the others. everything is very quiet. georges enters, turns round, then goes back along the corridor, crosses the room, comes through the apartment door into the hallway of the apartment. but it too is now empty and bright, with bare unpainted walls, no doors; only the door to the bedroom is open. behind that too, it appears to be empty and bright. georges goes toward it. at the same time, we hear georges' voice. at first he groans, but then begins inarticulately hollering, louder and louder. shortly after, we also hear:}
<D>__{anne's voice: georges, what's going on?}
