<L>__{exterior woods night}
<A>__{trees rise ominously around ray and claude as they push through dense underbrush.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i know these trees all look the same, but i'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. you sure you know where we're going?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{absolutely. the map is very clear.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{let me take a look at that map.}
<A>__{claude considers it from various angles.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{you call this a map? what was cookie smoking when he drew this?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{cookie didn't draw it. i did.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{you drew this?!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i knew you wouldn't come if i didn't have a map.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{that gripes my soul, man. we're out here in the middle of nowhere. there is shit nibbling at my balls! don't tell me you don't know where we're going!}
<A>__{ray shrugs and presses on. dumbfounded, claude considers the map again, then tears it to shreds. the braying of hounds echoes through the trees.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{hey, wait up!}
