<L>__{interior missile silo catwalk day}
<A>__{geordi and picard are walking down the catwalk ladders toward the missile's massive engines. now that the smoke has cleared and the place has been cleared up a bit, we get our first good look at the ship and the damage done in the borg attack.}
<C>__{geordi}
<P>__{(on the move)}
<D>__{cochrane was going to use this solid rocket booster to lift the ship into orbit. before the warp drive took over... everything would depend on these old chemical engines.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now here's the problem...}
<A>__{they arrive at a point on the fuselage where we can see a large section of the engines have been blasted away, leaving a deep, ugly scar broken conduit lines, wires that now lead to nothing. it's clear that a key piece of equipment has been destroyed.}
<C>__{geordi}
<P>__{(re: damage)}
<D>__{this used to be the throttle valve assembly.}
<P>__{(observing it)}
<D>__{it controls the thrust of the engines. it's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{can you reconstruct the throttle valve?}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{yeah... if i knew what it looked like. there's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{we need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there must be some design schematics... blueprints...}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{we're tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing.}
<A>__{they look at the damage in frustration.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{if it was just part of the warp drive, i'd know what to do. but this... it's like trying to rebuild orville wright's airplane with canvass and sticks.}
<A>__{picard thinks, remembers something.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{wait a minute...}
