<L>__{exterior front lawn day}
<A>__{william watches sadly. anita's good looking boyfriend darryl, a dead ringer for young stephen stills, loads her suitcases into a large turqouise chevy. the suitcases are adorned with plastic stick on flowers. all coolness is leaving william's life. mom watches nearby, worried and helpless. (their house is more austere, less "fun" than the other front lawns.)}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{take good care of her in san francisco, man.}
<A>__{darryl gives the kid a sub human look. he's invisible, too young to converse with.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{how can she leave such a loving family?}
<A>__{anita turns and heads towards them. she focuses on william, placing her hands on his young shoulders. her face is very close to him now, as she delivers this sage prediction of the future.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{one day you'll be cool.}
<A>__{he nods stoically, hopefully. he is utterly lost. she leans forward and whispers in his ear.}
<C>__{anita }
<D>__{look under your bed. it'll set you free.}
<A>__{anita shakes hands with mom, and exits. as the car takes off:}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{she'll be back.}
<A>__{in the distance we hear the whoop of her daughter.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{yeahhhhh hoooooooo.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{maybe not soon...}
<A>__{william watches wistfully. he moves away from his mother. she pulls him closer. shot moves in on his slightly fearful face.}
