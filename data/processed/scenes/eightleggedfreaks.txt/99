<A>__{bret speeds inside. he looks over his shoulder to check for his pursuers, they're gone. bret looks relieved. he faces forward as... whack! a support beam knocks him from his bike. the bike continues on into the tunnel alone. from the sound of things it travels pretty far before crashing. bret lies on the ground as dust settles onto his face. he looks up at a support beam which begins to crack. bret moves clear just as the ceiling caves in, sealing him in the mine.}
