<A>__{angle on alice: she whacks the hasp with the butt of the rifle. the hasp doesn't give. she gives it another butt stroke. it won't give. a shadow covers alice's back. she turns. another angle: mrs. voorhees is standing in the doorway, blocking the light. still carrying the machete, mrs. voorhees steps slowly toward alice. alice, with an almost useless .22 in her hands, does the only thing she can. she takes the weapon by the barrel and, swinging it like a baseball bat, whacks mrs. voorhees on the arm shoulder, knocking the killer off balance and into the wall. mrs. voorhees slams through a flimsy table, crushing it, and drops to the floor. alice runs out the door.}
