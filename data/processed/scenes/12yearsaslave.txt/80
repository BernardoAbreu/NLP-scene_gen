<L>__{interior ford planation great house night}
<A>__{as we come into the scene, solomon lays on a blanket on the floor. eventually, his eyes flutter, then open. he is in the foyer of the ford house. as he gets his bearings, he looks around the interior. the space is handsome, and well decorated. it is sharp contrast to the bleak surroundings, shacks and dungeons solomon has largely been accustom to during his time of slavery. it will be the "first and last time such a sumptuous resting place was granted" during his twelve years of bondage solomon doesn't have much chance to luxuriate in his surroundings. he hears a dog barking just outside, and is unnerved. has tibeats returned to finish what he started? from a study, master ford appears with a gun in hand. he goes to the door, opens it and looks outside. he can see nothing. satisfied, ford crosses back over to solomon. he is frank with solomon regarding the situation.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{i believe tibeats is skulkin' about the premises somewhere. he wants you dead, and he will attempt to have you so. it's no longer safe for you here. and i don't believe you will remain passive if tibeats attacks. i have transferred my debt to edwin epps. he will take charge of you.}

<P>__{(desperate, urgent)}
<D>__{master ford, you must know; i am not a slave.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{i cannot hear that.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{before i came to you i was a freeman.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{i am trying to save your life! and...i have a debt to be mindful of. that, now, is to edwin epps. he is a hard man. prides himself on being a "nigger breaker." but truthfully i could find no others who would have you. you've made a reputation of yourself. whatever your circumstances, you are an exceptional nigger, platt. i fear no good will come of it.}
