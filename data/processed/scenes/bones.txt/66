<A>__{jeremiah's mansion stands in the moonlight. its faux gerogian splendor in stark contrast to bones' building in the old neighborhood.}
<L>__{interior peet house continuous}
<A>__{the house is dark and quiet. all are asleep. the dog moves silently through the house sniffing at doors.}
<L>__{interior master bedroom continuous}
<A>__{the dog silently noses the door open and stealthily enters and pads softly over to jeremiah's side of the bed. where it stares intently at the sleeping jeremiah, who begins to toss and turn. he settles again on his back. his head tilted back, his soft, vulnerable throat exposed. the dog steps closer to the bed. we can almost feel the dog's hot fetid breath inches away from his throat. the dog stares at jeremiah. and for just a second the long doggy face wavers and changes: in shifting shades of black, a ragged red demonic face ripples beneath the black fur and looks for an instant as if it were about to lunge and rip out jeremiah's throat! but at the last second it freezes. head cocks and ear lifts as if hearing something in the wind. its master's voice, perhaps. and then the dog reverts to normal and pads out of the room as silently as it entered.}

<A>__{cinnabar stops outside the building. she's about to knock when she instinctively freezes. we can almost see the hairs standing up on her neck one by one. she looks around what is it? a sound, like a moan. is it her name? or just the wind. suddenly, with a creak, the door swings open. she takes a hesitant step into the building. suddenly she jumps, as a door to her left flies open. it's just patrick. she laughs in relief.}

<A>__{patrick too surprised and tongue tied to respond, so tia helps him out.}
<C>__{tia}
<D>__{good. we do need help. first you can help us eat lunch.}
<A>__{cinnabar follows patrick into the room, with a last tense look over her shoulder still the feeling something's there.}
