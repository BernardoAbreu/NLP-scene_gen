<L>__{ext: backyard later}
<A>__{a hand painted piece of cardboard reading "the magic show" is placed on an easel. agnes and all of the little kids sit in a semicircle on the grass. two minions dressed as magicians are doing a magic act with edith as their assistant. one minion blows up a balloon and puts it in edith's mouth. then the other whips out a chainsaw and fires it up, heading toward her. margo sees this and quickly intervenes.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{whoa! whoa! okay, okay, alright. that's enough of the magic show!}
<A>__{the minions don't hide their disappointment.}
<C>__{minions}
<D>__{awwww.}
<A>__{margo suddenly looks around as if she just heard something.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{wait, did you hear that? it sounded like the twinkling sounds of magical fairy dust.}
<C>__{agnes}
<P>__{(gasps)}
<D>__{it's the fairy princess! she's coming!}
<A>__{margo gasps and points up to the sky.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{look!}
<A>__{edith spits out her magic balloon in horror and we follow it up to reveal gru. dressed in a puffy pink dress, fairy wings, glittery eyelashes and tiara and magical wand. up on top of gru's house, the minions struggle to lower him down on a rope. edith's balloon floats by and distracts them. they let go of the rope and gru swings wildly, smashing into the wall of the house and crashing to the ground.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{aaaaaahh!}
<A>__{he stands up and tries to cover. agnes sighs happily, in awe of the fairy princess.}
<C>__{gru }
<P>__{(in falsetto)}
<D>__{it is i, gru...zinkerbell! the most magical fairy princess of all! and i am here to wish princess agnes a very happy birthday!}
<A>__{gru sprinkles the girls with glitter and they continue to stare, frozen. then a little girl raises her hand and speaks with a lisp.}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{how come you're tho fat?}
<A>__{gru grits his teeth, then forces a smile and speaks with a high pitched, dreamy voice.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{because my house is made of candy and sometimes i eat instead of facing my problems.}
<A>__{the girl starts to ask another question.}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{how come you have }
<A>__{gru cuts her off with a puff of fairy dust to the face. she}
<B>__{coughs.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{okay! time for cake!}
<A>__{as the kids run to the table, agnes approaches gru.}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{thank you, gru zinkerbell. you're the best fairy princess ever!}
<A>__{gru smiles.}
<C>__{gru}
<P>__{(in falsetto)}
<D>__{you are welcome, little girl.}
<A>__{she runs off, but quickly returns.}
<C>__{agnes}
<P>__{(whispers in his ear)}
<D>__{i know it's really you, gru. i'm just pretending for the other kids.}
<A>__{she runs off again to join her friends. gru watches her go. couldn't be happier. then he is approached by jillian, a heavily botoxed mom.}
<C>__{jillian}
<D>__{hey there, gru, mr. life of the party!}
<C>__{gru}
<P>__{(forcing a smile)}
<D>__{hello, jillian.}
<C>__{jillian}
<D>__{sooooo, i'm gonna go out on a limb here, but my friend natalie is recently single, and...}
<A>__{in the background, a homely natalie leans against a buffet table and seductively raises her eyebrows at gru. the table collapses to the ground beneath her.}
<C>__{gru}
<P>__{(realizes what's going on)}
<D>__{no, no, no, get off of the limb right now. no limb.}
<C>__{jillian}
<D>__{oh, come on...she's a riot. she sings karaoke, she has a lot of free time, looks aren't that important to her...}
<A>__{in the background, natalie inadvertently walks in front of a bottle pitch game, is struck by a ball, and falls to the ground.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{no, jill's, that is not happening. seriously. i'm fine.}
<C>__{jillian}
<P>__{(calling after gru)}
<D>__{okay, fine. forget natalie. how about my cousin linda?}
<A>__{gru walks off, passing by edith and margo.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jillian}
<D>__{oh, oh! i know someone whose husband just died!}
<A>__{splash! suddenly jillian is sprayed in the face with water. reveal gru holding a hose with a spray nozzle.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i did not see you there.}
<A>__{splash! he sprays her again. she falls down.}
<C>__{gru }
<D>__{or there.}
<A>__{he drops the hose and walks away, chuckling softly.}
