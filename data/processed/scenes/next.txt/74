<L>__{interior white room}
<A>__{the mp's surround cris, as foreseen. he remains in the center of them, crouched, motionless. for a long beat, they just stand there, rifles aimed at their frozen quarry.}
<P>__{wisdom (plasma screen)}
<D>__{cris, don't you feel some sense of obligation to the rest of us? your ability could save so many lives.}
<A>__{cris suddenly attacks...and with perfect economy of movement, like a diver executing thirteen twists in the second before he hits the water, cris executes the previous routine with a new "finale" and... elegantly slips past all the mp's into the hall and slams the door behind him, locking them in! the escape has the quality of magic. it takes a beat for the mp's to realize what has happened. observation booth wisdom and ferris are agog.}
<D>__{wisdom what happened? you idiots!}
<A>__{ferris draws her gun and charges down the stairs. outside white room cris is waiting for her and somehow he has her gun in his hand.}
<D>__{cris don't make me do what i can do.}
<A>__{cris spins and shoots wisdom in the shin as he starts down the stairs. wisdom collapses.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{don't get too attached to your arms and legs.}
<A>__{cris spins and gets the drop on baines.}
<D>__{cris don't.}
<A>__{baines sets down his gun. cris takes off.}
<C>__{wisdom}
<D>__{don't let him out of here alive.}
<A>__{baines opens the door to the white room. mp's stampede out in hot pursuit.}
<D>__{baines isolate the building. if there's one exit overlooked, he'll know it.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{if there's one soft heart, one slow shooter, he'll know it.}
<A>__{ferris attends to wisdom, bleeding on the stairs.}
<D>__{ferris don't worry. i caught him once; i will catch him again.}
<C>__{wisdom}
<D>__{be careful. i don't want anything to happen to you.}
<A>__{they care about each other more than they've let on. corridors cris. running. mp's and general security police close behind. no place to hide. soldiers open fire. cris dives for the floor, tumbles, gets to his feet, serpentines, and ends up behind a door that opens at the moment, as if by mental command, shielding him from gunfire. security police pour out from the other side. cris reaches around and grabs someone's gun. he opens fire, buying himself enough cover to get to a doorway. cris stops, thinks, then charges out shooting, fighting, running completing a condensed burst of four impossible tasks that get him to the next point of refuge. he waits, thinks, charges and, with another burst of choreographed action, makes it into an elevator whose doors conveniently open at that moment. he darts inside, keeps shooting, presses certain buttons starting several stories up, and waits for the doors to close.}
<D>__{sergeant you five, up. you five, down. the rest stay with me.}
