<A>__{carrie pushes her body up against his in response.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{...um, maybe... maybe not.}

<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{...and that body odor.}
<A>__{their reflection in the mirror intrigues her. intoxicates her. his aggression excites her. she pulls him into her. the metal bedframe bangs against the motel wall repeatedly as they make love. then slowly, the camera bisects the plaster and lumber divider and emerges in the next room...}
