<A>__{willis, a grossly overweight man in his late forties surrounded by a monolith of high tech, starts working his console.}
<C>__{willis}
<D>__{tracking... intercepting call... got it. ten seconds, mr. dean.}
<A>__{audio waveforms appear over willis' console. he implements digital filtering routines, cleaning up the sounds.}
<L>__{interior white house situation room day}
<A>__{the group listens intently. the call modulates, distorts, dissolves... then clarifies.}
<C>__{bazylev }
<D>__{hands... hands behind your head, mr.}
<A>__{president.}
<C>__{v.p. chandler}
<D>__{it's him. he is alive.}
<C>__{bazylev}
<D>__{i'm going to take your weapon now, and then i'm going to take you upstairs to join the others.}
<A>__{understand?}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{christ, they have him.}
<C>__{bazylev}
<D>__{and if you make any sudden moves, i will not hesitate to shoot.}
<C>__{general northwood}
<D>__{maybe they don't have him yet.}
<A>__{northwood stares up at the tactical board. air force one... surrounded by the f l5s.}
<C>__{general northwood}
<D>__{and maybe we aren't so helpless.}
<A>__{general northwood picks up a secure phone and dials.}
<C>__{general nortpnood}
<D>__{general greely, air force one has automatic countermeasures, right?}
<C>__{general greely}
<D>__{everything we own is in that plane.}
<C>__{general nortinood}
<D>__{so a single missile launched from a distance should be a mere distraction.}
<C>__{general greely}
<D>__{theoretically.}
<C>__{general northwood}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{ramutein tower control, please.}
<C>__{general greely}
<P>__{(getting it)}
<D>__{but the effect could be jarring.}
<C>__{general northwood}
<D>__{exactly. ramstein? general northwood... patch me through to your fighters. madame vice president... with your permission?}
<C>__{v.p. chandler}
<D>__{do it.}
