<A>__{oscar finds joe asleep on the lazy boy. he snores in that scary sleep apnea way holding his breath between snores. oscar notices a leather strap hanging down from the top shelf of a book case. he pulls up a chair to investigate. the strap leads to an old pair of binoculars. behind it, dusty books about birds. oscar grabs the binoculars and climbs down. oscar holds the binoculars to his face but the lenses are too far apart. oscar compensates by closing one eye and looking through only one lens. he focuses on his grandpa's nose hair. joe wakes.}
