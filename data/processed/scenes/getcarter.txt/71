<L>__{exterior the pantiles night}
<A>__{it's a large, new, ranch style house, set back from the road. the front garden is a landscape gardener's nightmare, with its phoney brick and wrought iron wishing well, porcelain dwarfs, lily pond, the lot. fairy lights hang over everything. there's a party going on. lights are on in every room and the rock music is loud. the drive is lined with sports cars. carter parks and gets out. out of a side door a young man stumbles towards the lily pond. there, he promptly throws up. carter watches from behind a tree. his attention shifts to the white bentley turning into the drive. it brakes sharply and the driver jumps out. cliff brumby has been to a police ball. he is impeccably dressed in tuxedo and white scarf. now he's hopping mad.}

<C>__{mrs brumby}
<D>__{cliff ...}
<A>__{brumby roars up to the front door, banging it furiously. a young woman in a party dress, expecting to greet a latecomer, is stunned to see who it is.}

<C>__{brumby}
<D>__{... spewing over my fucking goldfish.}
<A>__{he aims a kick at the young man's backside, sending him face down into the lily pond. mrs brumby gets out of the car and hovers for a moment. as she approaches the house, people pour out. brumby appears at the door with a boy pulling up his trousers.}

<C>__{brumby}
<D>__{sandra! unlock the door, you bitch.}
<A>__{carter pauses outside the front door and listens to the row going on upstairs. he opens the door and goes in.}
