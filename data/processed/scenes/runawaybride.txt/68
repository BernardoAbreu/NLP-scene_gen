<T>__{angle on:}
<A>__{cory as he runs for second base and with a slide beats the throw for the force out. the women jump and cheer maggie, again, the most boisterous.}
<T>__{angle on:}
<A>__{dennis recognizes ike as he walks up. dennis tells ike that he is going to marry maggie some day and shows ike where maggie is sitting.}
<T>__{angle on:}
<A>__{maggie spots ike as they sit back down. she groans.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{there he is. snoop doggy dogg.}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{where?}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{over there. ten o'clock. he's talking to our little dennis. dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{he looks better with that stuff out of his hair. he's an attractive man. ike finds maggie in the crowd and leaves dennis.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i'd say you've been in the sun too long. you handle him, okay? i could use five minutes off from that creep. before peggy can protest, maggie climbs down off the bleachers and goes and stands near the dugout near the rest of cory's team.}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{okay, that's fine. i can do that. ike comes up to peggy.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{hello, peggy phleming, "not the ice skater". ike indicates the seat next to peggy.}
<C>__{peggy}
<P>__{(protesting weakly)}
<A>__{that's maggie's seat... ike sits down comfortably.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{... and this is maggie's beer. he starts drinking it. on the field, cory is getting ready to steal third.}
<C>__{ike }
<A>__{that your husband out there? cory phleming, a local radio announcer.}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{have you listened to his morning show, "wake up with ballplayer"?}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{not yet. i had a phlemless morning. i hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{this game is pretty important to him. he made all stars in high school, you know.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{that must have made you proud. peggy takes a small sip off her soda.}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{he was going with maggie back then.}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<A>__{he was never one of her... i mean, they were never going to get... they just dated for a while. cory dives in for third and makes it. the crowd goes wild. peggy yells and jumps in.}
<C>__{peggy }
<A>__{good job, honey! but maggie's whoop sails out above it all. cory waves. but not at peggy. he directs his delight at maggie, who jumps up and down by the dugout. ike looks between cory, maggie and finally, peggy. peggy jerks her waving hand back down to her side and sits down. ike pretends not to have noticed. the two watch as maggie and cory smile at each other.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{it's nice that they're still friends.}
<C>__{peggy}
<P>__{(looking at maggie and cory)}
<A>__{oh, sure. that was a long time ago. see, she's not a man hater at all. she's very supportive of men... next batter hits one to deep left field and it lands in the grave yard. cory scores, greeted by maggie. ike and peggy watch as cory and maggie belly bump and high five each other in celebration of cory's play. no looks at peggy. ike keeps an empathetic silence, seeing that peggy is truly hurt.}
<C>__{peggy }
<A>__{i will be back in a second. suddenly, peggy stands, pushes past him and runs down the steps. maggie looks up just in time to catch peggy's exit. ike pulls his tape recorder out of his pocket and starts speaking into it. maggie shoots ike an accusing look, walks up to him in the bleachers and sits next to him.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{you've been here for three minutes. what did you do to her?}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{you can turn that finger around. ike does an on the button imitation of maggie jumping excitedly at cory. now maggie sees what he's getting at.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<A>__{you misinterpret everything. we've all been friends our whole lives. but that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{obviously, i'm not the only one who doesn't understand it. the uss maggie leaves quite a wake... excuse me. ike walks away. alone, maggie tries to seem enthused.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{see, i cheer good. what is he, a cheer critic?}
