<A>__{lana stands by the front door. she calls upstairs to ned.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{hurry up, darling. you'll be late!}
<A>__{frank slips in, wearing his greasy overalls. he wipes his hands on a rag... giving lana a sly wink.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{it's all taken care of. when do i knock on the door?}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{wait until i signal you. when i raise the blinds... you knock.}
<A>__{she steps over to the blinds and demonstrates. he knocks.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{not now!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{oh, later... right... okay.}
<A>__{she nods, patronizing. frank exits. lana picks up the skunk, cuddling him. ned comes down wearing his trademark gray suit. lana kisses him passionately... a final farewell.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{drive carefully, sweetheart. say bye bye to little ned. he loves his daddy... don't you stink pot?}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(pets the skunk)}
<D>__{see you tonight, junior.}
<A>__{as soon as ned closes the door, lana's smile vanishes and she casually tosses the skunk aside with a loud crash o.c.}
