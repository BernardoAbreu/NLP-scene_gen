<L>__{interior mozart's apartment living room dawn 1790's}
<A>__{it is as disordered as before, save that the table, previously littered with pages, is now completely bare. constanze looks at it with surprise and enters the bedroom.}
<L>__{interior mozart's apartment bedroom dawn 1790's}
<A>__{mozart is asleep in the bed. salieri is dozing on the nearby child's bed. the room is full of the trailing smoke from guttering and guttered candles. startled by constanze's entrance and her young son, salieri scrambles up. as he does so, he attempts to button his waistcoat, but does it ineptly, so that the vestment becomes bunched up, making him look absurd.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{your husband is ill, ma'am. he took sick. i brought him home.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{why you?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{i was at hand.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{well, thank you very much. you can go now.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{he needs me, ma'am.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{no, he doesn't. and i don't want you here. just go, please.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{he asked me to stay.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{and i'm asking you }
<A>__{she notices a movement from the bed. mozart wakes. he sees constanze and smiles with real joy. forgetting salieri, she goes to her husband.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{wolfi, i'm back. i'm still very angry with you, but i missed you so much.}
<A>__{she throws herself on the bed.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{i will never leave you again. if you'll just try a little harder to be nice to me. and i will try to do better, too. we must. we must! this was just silly and stupid.}
<A>__{she hugs her husband desperately. he stares at her with obvious relief, not able to speak. suddenly she sees the manuscript in his hand.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{what is this?}
<A>__{she looks at it and recognizes it.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{oh no, not this. not this, wolfi! you're not to work on this ever again! i've decided.}
<A>__{she takes it from his weak hand. at the same moment salieri reaches out his hand to take it and add it to the pile on the table. she stares at him, trying to understand suspicious and frightened and at the same time unable to make a sound. mozart makes a convulsive gesture to reclaim the pages. the coins brought by salieri fall on the floor. karl runs after them, laughing.}
<C>__{constanze}
<P>__{(to salieri)}
<D>__{this is not his handwriting.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{no. i was assisting him. he asked me.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{he's not going to work on this anymore. it is making him ill. please.}
<A>__{she extends her hand for the requiem, as she stands up. salieri hesitates.}
<C>__{constanze}
<P>__{(hard)}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{with extreme reluctance it costs him agony to do it salieri hands over the score of the requiem to her.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{she marches with the manuscript over to a large chest in the room, opens it, throws the manuscript inside, shuts the lid, locks it and pockets the key. involuntarily salieri stretches out his arms for the lost manuscript.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{but but but }
<A>__{she turns and faces him.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{he stares at her, stunned.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{i regret we have no servants to show you out, herr salieri. respect my wish and go.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{madame, i will respect his. he asked me to stay here.}
<A>__{they look at each other in mutual hatred. she turns to the bed. mozart appears to have gone to sleep again.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{wolfi?}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{wolfi?}
<A>__{she moves to the bed. the child is playing with the coins on the floor. faintly we hear the start of the lacrimosa from the requiem. salieri watches as she touches her husband's hand. as the music grows, we realize that mozart is dead. cu, constanze staring wide eyed in dawning apprehension. cu, salieri also comprehending hat he has been cheated. the music rises. cu, the child on the floor, playing with the money.}
