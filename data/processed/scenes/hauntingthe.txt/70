<L>__{interior theo's room night}
<A>__{the room is a lot less frightening now, especially with the lights on. nell sits on theo's bed. theo looks at the walls, silent, normal.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{i did just take a bath.}
<A>__{when nell doesn't respond for a moment, theo turns to her, sees her wrestling with herself.}

<D>__{mother always banged on the wall when she needed me. the night she died... i heard her, but i pretended i didn't. i was just so sick of it all. and then the banging stopped. and in the morning... she was dead. this is the first i've ever said this to anyone. that was the job i had, theo, it's the only job i've ever known, and i failed. i'm actually a bad person, theo. the world doesn't need me.}
<A>__{theo shakes her head, brushes at her eyes. the confession, on the top of the fright, has moved her deeply.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{oh, nell. eleven years. with all due respect to your mother who i'm sure was a saint, i'd have called doctor kevorkian, if not for her, for me.}
<A>__{it's such a horrible thought it makes nell smile, and they share a tearful laugh.}
