<L>__{exterior canyon road day}
<A>__{we see the utility truck still parked near the landslide blocking the road. reveal, on the far side, a telephone maintenance truck is now parked, emergency lights flashing and nearby, amid phoneworkers' climbing and repair gear, two more hard hats lying on blood soaked ground.}
<L>__{interior pham van's store day}
<A>__{the crowd is still jabbering away. rhonda speak over them:}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{no no no, they listen ! they can sense the slightest vibration through the ground. that's how they see! that's how they hunt !}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{so, like we don't vibrate, right? maybe they won't even come to here, huh? maybe they leave us alone.}
<A>__{val shakes his head, and marches over to the topographic map on the wall.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{they caught up with edgar here. they grabbed old fred here. they nailed the asshole dog here. and the doctor's place is here...}
<A>__{the spots he indicates describe a line leading along the valley straight toward town.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{this valley's just one long smorgasbord and if we don't haul ass outta here we're the next course.}
<A>__{we hear an a eerie shriek from outside. something shoots in through the window, striking earl in the chest!! earl flails frantically at it but it's only melvin's basketball. we glimpse melvin outside, doubled over with laughter. earl grabs the ball and hurls it viciously back, but melvin easily dodges it.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{you little ass wipe! you knock that off or you're gonna be shitting that basketball! pardon my french.}
<C>__{nestor}
<P>__{(to val)}
<D>__{now, val, let's assume they're as dangerous as you say. where are we going to go that's safer than right here?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{rhonda's got an idea about that.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{yes, see, they move very easily through the pleistocene alluvials...}
<P>__{(off their blank looks)}
<D>__{...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor. but they can't move through solid rock. i think we should travel west to the mountains.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{you know, up the jeep trail.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{the mountains are solid granite. we'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to bixby if we have to.}
