<A>__{denise cautiously makes her way to the bend at the end of the tunnel. as she approaches, the moaning sound gets louder. she turns the corner to see: two pale figures in filthy hospital gowns hunched over a shadowy object. denise gasps. they turn towards denise, revealing the partially devoured dead body of jerry. the two bone white ghouls are dripping with jerry's blood, they stare at denise, then return to their prey. denise screams in horror and runs, turning down another twist in the underground maze. she turns the corner and runs straight into several slow moving ghouls. the ghouls are of the same deathly white complexion, hair less with flaked, cracking skin. their yellow eyes shine in the darkness. they reach for her, but she breaks free and continues to run into the endless stretch of tunnels before her.}
