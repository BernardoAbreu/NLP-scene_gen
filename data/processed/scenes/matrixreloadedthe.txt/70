<L>__{exterior forest glade}
<A>__{smith and gregory fight in the glade. smith is always one step ahead. he is a cruel sensei, and doesnt pull punches. but with every blow gregory takes, he rebounds and attacks again. finally, just as he seems to be gaining on smith, he takes a rapid fire series of blows, and collapses to the ground, breathless and beaten.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{fuck. smith circles him.}
<C>__{smith}
<A>__{"pain is only weakness leaving your body. when you are sufficiently}
<D>__{strong, you will feel no pain."}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{tell me about what is happening. whats wrong with the world?}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{get up and fight.}
<A>__{gregory gets to his feet and takes a stance. smith stares at him from a relaxed poise. he slaps at gregory, who deflects the blow and takes a jab, nearly hitting smith on the chin. they circle.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{the world is not for you. he slaps, has it deflected, dodges a blow.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{smith}
<A>__{"youre not human, gregory. thats why you dont fit in. thats why}
<D>__{you have certain powers." gregory takes a swipe. they engage, then push off one another.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{what, am i from planet krypton?}
<C>__{smith}
<A>__{"not quite. but as humans continue to evolve, some are developing}
<D>__{capabilities beyond those of the average man. reality altering}
<A>__{abilities. i have them. others in the agency have them. and you have}
<D>__{them, too. were all that stands between law and order, and a terrorist dictatorship lead by the one called morpheus." they stop fighting for a moment.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{we need you to stop the terror. we need you to save our world. it sinks in. gregory is starting to believe.}
<C>__{smith}
<A>__{"we need you, because youre better than me. now push past your abilities. you can turn you imagination into reality. see your hands}
<D>__{striking me, see yourself overcoming me. fight, boy!"}
<A>__{smith comes at him, and gregory responds. their fists and kicks are a fast, then turn into a blur. gregory cant believe his own actions. smith misses a block, and gregory blows him backward with a chest punch. smith, recovering, looks up. gregory looks around. chandra is gone.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{where is she?}
<A>__{smith stands. from behind his back he produces a baseball sized glass ball. he tosses it to gregory.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{gregory looks in the ball. its a window to an apartment overlooking the city. chandra is in bed, waking up.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{she doesnt remember our encounter. shes fine. dont worry. the ball disappears. smith puts his hand to his earpiece.}
