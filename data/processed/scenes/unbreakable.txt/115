<D>__{come here i want to show you something.}
<A>__{elijah wheels over to one of the framed sketches on the wall. it's a charcoal drawing of a muscular figure shielding himself from a blow about to be delivered. a huge ominous shadow is covering him, as if something unspeakable and evil is just out of frame.}

<D>__{look at this. i just noticed this today.}

<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and i think you did it, of all things, for a women...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{not only do you have the physical traits of a hero, down somewhere in there, you have the moral code of one too. you were ready to sacrifice everything for what's right. where can you find that these days?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{only thing you didn't realize is that you were giving up a part of yourself when you gave up football. the physical part. and you need that part desperately to feel balance again...}

<D>__{i never said you couldn't be killed. i never said that.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you have a problem, elijah. my wife is right. somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it.}
