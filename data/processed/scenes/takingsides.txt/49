<L>__{exterior flea market day}
<A>__{bright summer's day. emmi pushing her way through the crowded market. she comes to the stall with gramophone records. david is with her, staying behind a little so as not to disturb her. she starts to look through the records, blowing her nose from time to time. then she finds a box of records, opens it, is delighted. she bargains with the stallholder, and she hands over money. she shows her purchase to david happily. they struggle on in the crowd. david suddenly stops. he has spotted a tandem. the bicycle with two seats is old and rusty but seems to be in working order. david steps up to it, touches it.}
