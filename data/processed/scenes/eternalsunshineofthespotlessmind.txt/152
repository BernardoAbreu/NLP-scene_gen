<A>__{she steps aside for stan to enter. he does, looks around, sees the tapes and the stuffed envelopes on the floor.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i know what it is.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{then why did you ask me?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i don't know. i just there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{they have a right to know. howard is a thief. he steals the truth.}
<P>__{(suddenly weeping)}
<D>__{i can't remember my baby! i can't remember my baby. it existed and i can't even remember. do you understand that?}
<A>__{stan doesn't know what to say. he stands there dumbly. mary slumps into a ball on a chair.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{mary, people come to him voluntarily.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i won't allow it. those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. what do you think of that? that's from my quote book.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{the office is filled with people who want their memories re erased.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(hysterically)}
<D>__{remember the alamo! remember the alamo!}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{mary... please. this is hurting people.}
<A>__{long pause, then:}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(small)}
<D>__{i don't want to hurt people.}
<P>__{(breaking down)}
<D>__{but these things happened! all these little sadnesses, the big ones. what if no one remembers? what does that do to the world?}
<P>__{(beat, quietly)}
<D>__{someone has to remember, stan.}
<A>__{they look at each other.}
