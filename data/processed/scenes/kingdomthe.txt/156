<T>__{tight on haytham:}
<A>__{taking this all in: the violence. the terror of this family, the defiance on the faces of these young souls. al ghazi, post game shakes, a tear running down his cheeks, spattered in blood, stares at fleury. the man haytham shot is not dead: ragged gasps. fleury and al ghazi lock eyes, then take in the tragedy of the room kids their children's age, never to be the same. al ghazi to the room, in arabic:}
<D>__{colonel al ghazi is everyone alright?}
<A>__{silent stares from the saudis. the little girl janet saw earlier, eyes still on janet, moves to her brother he holds her tight, his eyes down. janet kneels, heart breaking, holds her hand out: i can help you little one. the little girl holds a fist out to janet, tears in her eyes: okay. janet slowly crouches over to her, the older women's eyes on her, piercing.}
<P>__{colonel al ghazi (cont'd) (to the little girl, in arabic)}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<A>__{little one trembles. one of the women in the corner calls to her in arabic, sharp. janet just strokes the back of her little bloody fist. her little hand opens, shaking: this is a gift for you. janet's face ghost white: little one is trying to give her a marble... al ghazi steps closer, sees the marble. processes things. immediately looks over at the huddled mass: the grandfather staring right back at him. we now see the old man clearly. al ghazi shaking, slowly steps to him, hands out...}
<P>__{colonel al ghazi (cont'd) (in arabic)}
<D>__{let me help you up, old man...}
<A>__{the old man nods a `no.'}
<P>__{colonel al ghazi (cont'd) (in arabic)}
<D>__{give me your hands!}
<A>__{al ghazi rips grandfather up now. the family screams. al ghazi pulls the old man's hands from under his thobe: missing fingers. bends at the knees to look the old man right in his eyes, lifts his chin with his hand.}
<P>__{colonel al ghazi (cont'd) (dazed, starting to realize)}
<D>__{...hamza.}
<A>__{the old man looks up at al ghazi: rage and defiance.}

<D>__{you are a traitor to your country... a traitor to your god. colonel al ghazi i am no traitor to my god. you are.}
<A>__{al ghazi's chest explodes before we hear the booms: the 15 year old grandson, firing a cheap, nickel plated 9mm. everybody drops. the family huddles that much closer to the floor. al ghazi falls back to the floor, pulling grandfather with him. fleury's standing stock still, out of body now: he can only see a teenager built like a river reed, like his own son... not a murderer who just shot his friend. quiet sick:}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{...don't...}
<A>__{the 15 year old steps to the doorway, pulls the trigger again: the cheap 9mm jams. janet lifts up with her ak, aims it at the boy's chest.}
<C>__{ronald fleury }
<D>__{...drop it, son...please...}
<A>__{...the teenager wiping his tears: so he can see clear enough to clear his jammed weapon. half young boy, the other half something much more dangerous...expert movements from his hands, racking back the slide, thumbing the still smoking shell from the ejector, letting the slide go, racking another round into the chamber. then... fleury finally pulls his trigger. utter distortion as the old man reaches for the teenager's fallen hand gun. janet, screaming, raises her gun towards the old man as al ghazi shoots the old man in the chest. sobbing, the little boy runs to his fallen grandfather. janet, still screaming, covers the family. the grandfather whispers something we cannot hear in the little boy's ear. tight on haytham taking it all in: the bleeding, dying teenager; his hysterical sister; hamza choking, clutching for his grandson. chaos, confusion, conflict swirling in haytham's eyes. a platoon of saudi police slowly enter the room. janet goes to the shot 15 year old, starts trying to stop the bleeding... fleury reaching for the dying al ghazi, cradling him. tears spill as his eyes move from the dying boy to the old man, back down to al ghazi. fleury grasps al ghazi's hand, as a saudi man would.}
