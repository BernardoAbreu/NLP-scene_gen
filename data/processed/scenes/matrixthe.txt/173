<L>__{interior presidential suite (matrix) day}
<A>__{an enormous explosion thunders above them, shaking the building. the alarm sounds, emergency sprinklers begin showering the room. agent smith smashes a table.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{find them and destroy them!}
<A>__{agent jones nods and touches his ear piece.}
<L>__{exterior roof (matrix) day}
<A>__{the roof access tower is now engulfed in flames as neo and trinity lay waste to a dozen more marines. guns and knives, like extensions of their bodies used with the same deadly precision as their feet and their fists. across the roof, the pilot inside the army helicopter watches the ferocious onslaught.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{i repeat, we are under attack!}
<A>__{suddenly his face, his whole body dissolves, consumed by spreading locust like swarm, of static as agent jones emerges. just as she drops the last marine, trinity sees what's coming. neo sees her, the fear in her face, and he knows what is behind him. screaming, he whirls, guns filling his hands with thought speed. fingers pumping, shells ejecting, dancing up and away, we look through the sights and gun smoke at the agent blurred with motion until the hammers click against empty metal.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{trinity!}
<A>__{agent jones charges.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{... help.}
<A>__{his gun booms as we enter the liquid space of bullet time. the air sizzles with wads of lead like angry flies as neo twists, bends, ducks just between them. agent jones still running, narrows the gap, the bullets coming faster until neo bent impossibly back, one hand on the ground as a spiraling gray ball shears open his shoulder. he starts to scream as another digs a red groove across his thigh. he has only time to look up, to see the barrel when agent jones, standing over him, pulls the trigger the final time. click. empty. neo rolls, reaching for another gun when around house kick snaps his jaw. agent jones grabs the gun and levels it at neo.}
<C>__{agent jones}
<D>__{only human...}
<A>__{suddenly agent jones stops. something is wrong. he scans the roof. trinity is gone. immediately, he whirls around and turns straight into the muzzle of her .45 jammed right into his head.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{dodge this, motherfucker!}
<A>__{boom! boom! boom! the body flies back with a flash of mercurial light and when it hits the ground it is the pilot. trinity helps neo up.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{you're hit }
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<A>__{neo is already looking at the helicopter.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{can you fly that thing?}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{not yet.}
<A>__{she pulls out a cellular phone.}
