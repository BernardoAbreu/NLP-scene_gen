<A>__{later that evening, linda is seen in her bed, sleeping. ashly covers her with a blanket, kisses her, and walks to the door, closing it quietly behind him.}
<L>__{58 interior night m.r.}
<A>__{ashly joins scott and shelly who sit near the fire in the main room. from the cellar, strange moans, sobs and laughter emerge, then horrible rasping sounds from cheryl's breathing. through the next sequence of dialogue, her breathing becomes louder then somewhat quiet.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{she'll be okay ash, she just took a bad bump.}
<C>__{ashly}
<P>__{(quietly) yeah.}
<A>__{scott and shelly listen to the strange noises from below as ashly looks out the window to the woods beyond.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{we've still got a few hours before morning.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{i don't know if i can wait that long.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{you have to. we all have to. then, once it's light out, we'll try to find a way to get around that chasm.}
<C>__{shelly}
<P>__{(covering her ears) why does she keep}
<D>__{making those horrible noises?}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{and what about her eyes?}

<P>__{what about her eyes? (desperately)}
<D>__{for god's sake what happened to her eyes?!}
<A>__{cheryl patiently sits in the cellars darkness with a streak of light across her eyes from the crack in the trap door. her head is slightly tilted as she watches and listens to what is said above. from her point of view we hear scott speak to shelly.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{everything's gonna be all right.}
<A>__{cheryl's lips part slightly and a thick blackish yellow liquid drools out between her teeth. she grins.}
