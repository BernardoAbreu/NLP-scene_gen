<B>__{dancing couples}
<A>__{fill the screen; we glide among them and finally come to follow one couple: norville and mrs. mussburger, a large middle aged woman of the margaret dumont mold in an elaborately flowered and old fashioned evening gown, low cut in spite of her overly heavy figure. she wears a large flowered hat with a rolled up veil.}
<C>__{mrs. mussburger}
<D>__{ so we'd gone out to the hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{that must have been quite a disappointment, mrs. mussburger.}
<C>__{mrs. mussburger}
<D>__{disappointment? j'etais destroyee! i was in bed for a week! positively sick with fury! i called in the gardener and said, 'monsieur gonzalez, either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee!}
<A>__{she throws her head back and roars with laughter. angle their feet as the large woman leans back to laugh, her feet stay planted on the ground and norville's rise to be dragged with his toes scraping the floor through the continuing dance.}
<C>__{mrs. mussburger}
<D>__{i'm brushing up on my french with the most charming man, pierre of fifth avenue. do you know him?}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{i haven't had }

<A>__{mussburger has entered frame.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{sure, sure. i'm going to borrow norville for a while, if you don't mind, dear.}
<A>__{mixing down as they leave her:}
<C>__{mrs. mussburger}
<D>__{well, frankly, i...}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{you have a charming wife, mr. muss uh, sid.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{so they tell me. norville, let me shepherd you through some of the introductions here. try not to talk too much; some of our biggest stockholders are, uh scratch that: say whatever you want.}
<B>__{entryway}
<A>__{as amy enters in a simple yet stunning evening gown. she looks around the room, then starts across the crowded floor towards the punch bowl.}
<B>__{norville}
<A>__{as mussburger introduces him to a tall, imposing businessman in a tuxedo and a ten gallon hat.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{norville barnes, allow me to introduce mr. zebulon cardozo, one of hudsucker industries largest and most loyal stockholders.}
<A>__{ignoring norville's proffered hand:}
<C>__{cardozo }
<D>__{dammit boy, what's this i hear about you bein' an embecile? what the hell is ailin' ya?! a week ago my stock was worth twice what it is now! i'm considering dumping the whole shootin' match, unless i see some vast improvement! dammit, boy, it's a range war! either you pull our wagons into a circle or i'm pullin' out of the wagon train!}
<A>__{norville gives him a forced but hearty laugh of reassurance.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{no need for concern, sir; it's only natural in a period of transition for the more timid element to run for cover }
<C>__{cardozo}
<D>__{so i'm yella, am i?!!}
<A>__{he starts peeling off his tuxedo jacket:}
<C>__{cardozo}
<D>__{...we'll see who's yella!!}
<A>__{his wife, a small wiry woman, steps in as mussburger starts dragging norville away.}
<C>__{mrs. cardozo}
<D>__{zebulon, you mind now and quit bein' sech an ole grizzly.}
<A>__{as he reluctantly starts shrugging back into the jacket:}
<C>__{cardozo}
<D>__{aww, i wasn't gonna hurt the boy, lorelei...}
<B>__{mussburger and norville}
<A>__{as they make their way through the room norville is mopping at his brow with a handkerchief.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{i'm sorry, sid, i thought maybe if i showed him the long view we might }
<A>__{thump! dabbing at his brow, norville has walked square into the back of a debonaire man holding a martini. the drink sloshes and the man turns testily to face him.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{norville, this is thorstensen finlandsen, who heads a radical splinter group of disgruntled investors.}
<A>__{norville nervously pumps findlandsen's hand.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{hello, mr. finlandsen, so sorry to meet you uh, happy to walk into y uh, pleased to make your }
<A>__{findlandsen raises his hand to look quizzically at norville's handkerchief which he now holds himself, apparently having been given it during the handshake. he hands it back to norville.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{thank you, sir...}
<A>__{he stuffs it nervously into his outside breast pocket as findlandsen stares at him. mussburger stands watching in the executive at ease, hands dug into his pockets.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{...i understand your concern about the down ward, you know, but i think you'll find under our strong new leadership...}
<A>__{as norville's hand drops from his breast pocket the handkerchief, perhaps caught on his sleeve, whips out of the pocket and follows his hand down. findlandsen looks down and norville follows his look, and stoops below frame to retrieve the hanky. findlandsen leans quizzically forward and peers down at norville, who continues, o.s.}
<C>__{norville }
<D>__{we anticipate, in short order, an upward...}
<A>__{in rapid fire, norville straightens up into crunch findlandsen, whose head snaps back, eyes rolling, a hand pressed to his nose, drink sloshing; norville, one hand pressed to the back of his own head and the other wildly waving his hanky for balance, takes a staggering step forward onto the toe of an elegantly gowned mrs. findlandsen.}
<C>__{mrs. findlandsen}
<D>__{ahhh!}
<A>__{there is a drum roll and, as the lights dim:}
<B>__{emcee}
<A>__{grabs the large old fashioned microphone in front of the band and grins.}
<C>__{emcee}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, distinguished members of the hudsucker board. i give you the king of swing, the rajah of romance, the incredible, the unforgettable mister vic... tenetta!}
<A>__{vic tenetta takes the microphone from the emcee who backs away, applauding as tenetta starts to croon. he wears a white dinner jacket. his jet black hair sweeps out over his forehead in a roguishly pompadoured mat; one forelock droops and bounces across his forehead.}
