<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{what else could i do? there were kids everywhere. besides he's suspicious.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{he's paranoid. that's why i'm paying you the gdp of a small country to get close to him. you could have got him in the sack. you should have got him in the car park. now you're going to have to take him out long range!}
