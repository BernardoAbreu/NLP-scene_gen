<B>__{by}
<A>__{w.p. mayhew" a hand enters with pen to inscribe: "to barton may this little entertainment divert you in your sojourn among the philistines. bill" the book is closed and picked up.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{as thoomp! the heavy volume is deposited across the table, in front of barton, by mayhew. barton, mayhew, and audrey are seated around a picnic table. it is one of a few tables littering the lot of a small stucco open air hamburger stand. it is peaceful early evening. the last of the sunlight slopes down through palm trees. barton, mayhew, and audrey are the only customers at the stand. mayhew's black ford stands alone at the edge of the lot. mayhew leans back in his chair.}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{if i close m'eyes i can almost smell the live oak.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{that's hamburger grease, bill.}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{well, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish on me lyin' and deceitful...}
<A>__{his eyes still closed, he waves a limp hand gently in the breeze.}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{...still, i must say. i haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. don't you find it so, barton? ain't writin' peace?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{well... actually, no bill...}
<A>__{barton looks nervously at audrey before continuing.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{...no, i've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man to help somehow to ease his suffering. maybe it's a personal pain. at any rate, i don't believe good work is possible without it.}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{mmm. wal, me, i just enjoy maikn' things up. yessir. escape... it's when i can't write, can't escape m'self, that i want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. mm...}
<A>__{he sighs and reaches for a bottle of wild turkey.}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{...this'll sometimes help.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{that doesn't help anything, bill.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{that's true, bill. i've never found it to help my writing.}
<A>__{mayhew is becoming testy:}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{your writing? son, have you ever heard the story of soloman's mammy }
<A>__{audrey, anticipating, jumps hastily in. she taps the book on the table.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{you should read this, barton. i think it's bill's finest, or among his finest anyway.}
<A>__{mayhew looks at her narrowly.}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{so now i'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{bill}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{and what would that be, son?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{i don't know exactly. but i do know what you're doing with that drink. you're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{no son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. no, i'm usin' it to build somethin'.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{i'm buildin' a levee. gulp by gulp, brick by brick. raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{maybe you better too, barton. before you get buried under his manure.}
<A>__{mayhew chuckles.}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{m'honey pretends to be impatient with me, barton, but she'll put up with anything.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{not anything, bill. don't test me.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{you're lucky she puts up with as much as she does.}
<A>__{mayhew is getting to his feet.}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{am i? maybe to a schoolboy's eye. people who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity the basest coin there is.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{stop it, bill!}
<A>__{he wanders over to a corner of the lot between two palm trees, still clutching his bottle, his back to barton and audrey, and urinates into the grass. he is singing loudly "old black joe." audrey walks over to him.}
<B>__{barton}
<A>__{watching her go.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{audrey touches mayhew's elbow. he looks at her, stops singing, she murmurs something, and he bellows:}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{the truth, m'honey, is a tart that does not bear scrutiny.}
<A>__{she touches him again, murmuring, and he lashes out at her, knocking her to the ground.}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{breach my levee at your peril!}
<B>__{barton}
<A>__{he rises.}
<B>__{audrey}
<A>__{coming back to barton.}
<B>__{mayhew}
<A>__{stumbling off down the dusty road, muttering to himself and waving his bottle of wild turkey.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{let him go.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{that son of a bitch... don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.}
<A>__{he looks down the road. mayhew is a small lone figure, weaving in the dust.}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{i will jus' walk on down to the pacific, and from there i will... improvise.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{are you all right?}
<A>__{we hear distant bellowing:}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{silent upon a hill in darien!}
<A>__{audrey bursts into tears. barton puts his arms around her and she leans into him.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{audrey, you can't put up with this.}
<A>__{gradually, she collects herself, wiping her tears.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{...oh barton, i feel so... sorry for him!}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{what?! he's a son of a bitch!}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{no, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about estelle. his wife still lives in fayettesville. she's... disturbed.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{really?...}
<A>__{he considers this for a moment, but his anger returns.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{...well that doesn't excuse his behavior.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{he'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. he always does.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{okay, but that doesn't excuse his}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{barton. empathy requires... understanding.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{what. what don't i understand?}
<A>__{audrey gazes at him.}
<B>__{mayhew}
<A>__{he is very distant now, weaving but somehow dignified in his light summer suit. "old black joe" floats back to us in the twilight.}
