<L>__{interior camp mess hall insert bowl of slop day}
<A>__{we see wooden spoon doing exactly what ada was doing, just swirling the spoon around in what looks like dirty water with a carrot in it, the bowl is chopped and cracked, the spoon is old and almost white from use... the handle still retains its wooden look... as we pull back we see helmut is swirling the spoon in the slop... behind him is a guard just watching his actions... after a beat, the guard taps helmut on the shoulder...}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{tsk! tsk! tsk! shame on you, doork... shame... don't you want to grow big and strong like me?}
<A>__{helmut knows he's in trouble and just waits indifferently for the fireworks to start...}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{we must eat our food! do we want uncle to feed the little man?}
<A>__{the guard pulls the man next to helmut out of his seat and practically throws him to the floor to make room for himself to sit down next to helmut which he does... he half turns his body towards helmut and turns helmut around in the same fashion so they are almost facing one another. the guard takes the wooden spoon and fills it with the soup and proceeds to feed helmut... he stuffs the spoonful of soup into his mouth... and helmut takes and swallows... then the guard takes another spoonful and makes believe he is blowing it (like a mother blows the hot soup not to burn the baby's mouth)... and forces the spoonful into helmut's mouth.}
<C>__{guard}
<P>__{(continuing to feed}
<D>__{him as he puts the}
<P>__{spoon in his mouth)}
<D>__{and now one for aunt ada...}
<A>__{as the guard uses the name ada, helmut bites down on the spoon and won't let it go... but if looks could kill... he stares at the guard with hate...}
<C>__{guard}
<P>__{(pulling the spoon)}
<D>__{let go, doork, let go... it's the soup that makes us big and strong... not the spoon... let it go!}
<A>__{helmut still holds it clenched in his teeth, and the guard smacks his face full force. helmut lets it go... and holds his face, embarrassed and humiliated as any many would be...}
<C>__{guard}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{now let's try it again...}
<A>__{he fills the spoon and sticks it toward helmut's mouth, but helmut clenches his teeth keeping his mouth shut.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{i said let's try it again...}
<A>__{he shoves the spoon into his lips, as the soup drips all over the front of helmut's shirt. the guard uses the spoon to clean the front of his shirt and forces the liquid he took from the shirt front into helmut's mouth... some of the men at the table and surrounding tables feel for helmut, others think it's funny... they laugh quietly.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{oh, i know why you're unhappy... soup without bread is terrible...}
<A>__{the guard takes the large loaf of brown bread and rips a huge piece out of the center of the loaf and proceeds to stuff helmut's mouth with bread, until he looks like his cheeks are eight times their normal size.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{isn't that better? now take some soup...}
<A>__{he pushes a spoonful of soup into his mouth which is so full, nothing can get in... consequently the bread spills out, the soup spills out... and he is a mess... (we play this scene for plot value, but it will work comically as well.)}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{i've had enough, thank you... no more, please...}
<A>__{the guard just stares at him...}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{please!}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{i'm surprised at you, doork, you've been here two years now, you should have learned we, of the third reich, never acknowledge the weak, sniveling, begging of you swine... that's all you're good for... begging... pleading... praying... you're a disgrace to the human race. that's why we of the superior race must do away with all of you...}
<A>__{the guard turns to the other men at the table, and goes into one of his mentally unbalanced tirades...}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{and we will! we will! do away with all of you. you're worthless pigs... with no courage, no guts, why if anyone did to me what i just did to doork i would kill him!}
<P>__{(turning to helmut)}
<D>__{why don't you kill me, doork? go on... kill me... kill me... take the knife from the table and kill me...}
<A>__{helmut looks at the knife on the table, picks it up, holds it in stabbing style, thinks about it... and we know by his look, he would love to...}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(with knife in hand)}
<D>__{i would kill you... but i am getting my release any day now... and i won't do anything that would spoil my chances...}
<A>__{helmut digs the knife into the table top and buries his head in his hands... totally shook from the encounter...}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{your release?}
<A>__{he begins to laugh, but hysterically.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{release? they told me you were funny... but i never realized just how funny you are... release ????}
<A>__{and the hysterical laughter really echoes throughout the mess hall as the guard makes his way towards the exit. the men at the table slowly get up and exit the scene, as do the others at the surrounding tables... leaving helmut just sitting there... we pull back to reveal the empty mess hall, and the lonely sad body of helmut, as he looks around realizing he's alone, gets up and slowly creeps out of the hall like a puppy with his tail between his legs... as we}
