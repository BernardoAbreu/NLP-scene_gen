<L>__{exterior salisbury plain. day.}
<A>__{the whole regiment is gathered. everybody is in their ceremonial uniform. it all has the feeling of the changing of the guard rather than anything related to a real battle. the day is hot, the plains are quiet and beautiful, the gathering is huge, there is a real sense of pride and anticipation. captain nicholls, resplendent in full uniform rides joey out over the vast expanse of the plain. both nicholls and joey are dressed up like something from the last century, out of the boer war, even the charge of the light brigade. nicholls is proud and confident. they gather before hundreds of men and horses all lined up to be inspected. charlie joins them, looking pretty good on blenheim. finally, nicholls and charlie reach stewart and topthorn waiting in position.}

<A>__{nicholls and stewart and charlie prepare themselves for the charge. joey and topthorn size up to one another.}
<C>__{major stewart}
<D>__{over to you, captain nicholls.}
<A>__{topthorn bristles at joey. everyone is highly charged. the competition between stewart and nicholls seems to have been absorbed between the horses. topthorn and joey square up for the practice charge like two athletes before a race.}
<C>__{captain nicholls}
<D>__{draw...swords!}
<A>__{nicholls raises his sword. it glints in the summer air. it seems to hang there forever. every man follows suit. topthorn and joey glance at each other, ready to charge.}
<C>__{captain nicholls }
<D>__{give...point!}
<A>__{every sword is pointed directly ahead at arm's length.}
<C>__{captain nicholls }
<D>__{charge!!!!}
<A>__{a roar goes up from the men and a deafening pounding of hooves breaks the silence. the huge line of horses start running straight ahead of them. joey and topthorn run off at top speed. dust and earth rise up behind them. bugles, the deafening thunder of hooves. it is exhilarating. we see the scale of the operation, we enjoy the speed and the splendor of the mass of men and horses. the soldiers shout in glee and excitement. each man pushes his horse to out run those around him, nicholls and stewart seem locked in mortal combat. nicholls smiles at stewart, confidently. topthorn starts to pull away, ahead of all the other horses in the line. nicholls pushes joey on. topthorn seems too strong, joey will never catch them. nicholls is determined not to be beaten.}
<C>__{captain nicholls }
<D>__{come on, joey. i know you've got it. come on, boy! come on!}
<A>__{he pushes joey on. joey digs in and finds hidden strength and speed. he starts to catch up with topthorn and draws along side. nicholls and stewart exchange tense looks.}
<C>__{captain nicholls }
<D>__{come on, boy!}
<A>__{stewart is amazed and pushes topthorn harder. now both riders are going at their top speed. they are neck and neck they fight for every inch of advantage, every fibre of their being invested in the race. nicholls pushes joey on and joey pulls away. joey inches forward till he is almost a length ahead of topthorn. the effort is enormous. nicholls looks back at stewart, very happy. stewart's frustration shows. he knows he is beaten. then suddenly they race over the line. nicholls spears a ring decorated with a blue ribbon and pulls joey to a halt. they have crossed the enemy line. nicholls is ecstatic. topthorn comes to joey's side.}
<C>__{major stewart}
<D>__{whoa. whoa.}
<A>__{nicholls laughs, grinning.}
<C>__{captain nicholls}
<D>__{nice of you to turn up.}
<A>__{the horses are nose to nose, snorting, we sense the heat, the exertion. topthorn and joey are brought together by the effort. we sense topthorn's newly minted respect for joey. and joey is no soft touch he slightly holds his head up in victory, letting topthorn know that he knows he won. the other horses come charging in. there is a real sense of achievement and congratulation amongst the regiment.}
<C>__{major stewart}
<D>__{he's got speed...i will give him that. but has he got stamina?}
<C>__{captain nicholls}
<D>__{he has everything.}
<A>__{the two men enjoy the moment of rivalry and the exhilaration of it all. the two horses, face to face rub against each other for the first time. a bond has been formed...}
