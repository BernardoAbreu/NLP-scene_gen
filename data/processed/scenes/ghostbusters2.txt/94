<L>__{interior venkman's loft same night (later)}
<A>__{the big open loft space is a chaotic clutter of mismatched furniture, old magazines, books, tapes, and sports equipment. venkman is asleep on the floor, still wearing his coat, scarf, hat and gloves, having collapsed just short of the bedroom. the doorbell rings, he wakes up, lumbers to his feet and answers it. he opens the door and sees dana standing there. she is wearing only a nightgown under her coat and oscar is naked, wrapped in a baby blanket.}
<C>__{dana}
<P>__{(somewhat embarrassed to be there)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. were you on your way out?}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(surprised to see her)}
<D>__{no, i just got in a couple hours ago. come on in.}
<P>__{(noting her apparel)}
<D>__{are we having a pajama party?}
<C>__{dana}
<P>__{(upset)}
<D>__{peter, the bathtub tried to eat oscar.}
<A>__{venkman looks at her for a long moment.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{you know, if anyone else told me that, i'd have serious doubts. but coming from you, i can't honestly say i'm surprised.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{i must be losing my mind. at the museum today i could have sworn that terrible painting of vigo looked right at me.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{who could blame him? were you wearing this nightgown?}
<C>__{dana}
<P>__{(distraught)}
<D>__{i don't know what to do anymore.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{i will get ray and egon to check out the bathtub. you better stay here.}
<A>__{he exits to the bathroom. she looks around the loft, amazed at the disorder. venkman comes back immediately with an old sweatshirt and takes oscar from her.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{now this kid has a serious nudity problem.}
<A>__{he spreads the sweatshirt out on the sofa, lays the baby on it and starts tying it around him like a diaper.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(to the baby)}
<D>__{this is joe namath's old number, you know. you could get a lot of chicks with this. just don't pee in it.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{peter, what about the bathtub?}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(grabs the phone and dials)}
<D>__{we'll take care of that.}
<P>__{(on the phone)}
<D>__{ray, pete. listen, get over to dana's right away ... her bathtub pulled a fast one tried to eat the kid.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{it was full of this awful pink ooze.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(to ray)}
<D>__{sounds like another slime job ... no, they're all right. they're here now ... right ... let me know.}
<A>__{he hangs up.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{they're going over there right now. you might as well make yourself at home. let me show you around.}
<P>__{(he crosses to the kitchen area)}
<D>__{this is the cuisine de maison }
<A>__{it's an incredible mess. the sink is piled high with dirty dishes and the counters are littered with all sorts of food trash. he grabs a big open hefty bag on the floor and starts throwing garbage into it.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(looking at the sink)}
<D>__{we may have to wash some of these if you get hungry }
<P>__{(he looks in the fridge)}
<D>__{ but there's no food anyway so forget about it. i have all kinds of carry out menus if you feel like ordering.}
<A>__{he opens a drawer full of pizza, barbecue and chinese food menus, then crosses to the bathroom.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{bathroom's right here let me just tidy up a few things.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.}
<A>__{he goes into the bathroom and we hear water running, the toilet flushing and more items going into the hefty bag.}
<C>__{venkman }
<D>__{the shower works but it's a little tricky. they're both marked "hot." it takes a little practice, but at least this one won't try and eat you.}
<A>__{he comes out of the bathroom with the now loaded hefty bag over his shoulder.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{be careful on that sofa it's a butt biter. but the bed's good and i just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free. in fact, i think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{really? and how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{for me it's best if i sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me. if we go the other way i'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{how about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{or we could do that.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(she picks up oscar)}
<D>__{poor baby. i think i should put him down now.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{i will put him down for you.}
<P>__{(taking the baby)}
<D>__{you are way too short! and your belly button sticks out! you're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!}
<A>__{venkman carries the baby into the bedroom leaving dana in the living room, feeling more relaxed and a lot safer.}
