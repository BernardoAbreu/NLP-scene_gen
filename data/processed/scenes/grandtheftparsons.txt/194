<D>__{the hell you are, kaufman.}
<A>__{stanley picks up the phone and starts to dial.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{you know i can't let you do that?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{i know you have to.}
<A>__{stanley smashes the receiver down onto the table. everyone jumps.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{i don't have to do anything, mister kaufman. this is my loss! this was my son! how dare you try to take my grief away from me.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{it's too late to claim him now.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{what the hell does that mean?}
<A>__{they are almost nose to nose now.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{it means that you were never there when it mattered to gram. it means that you stopped being a father the moment he stopped doing your bidding. it means that you learned to care too late. that's what it means.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{i don't have to justify my relationship with gram to you.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{not to me, no.}
<A>__{stanley sits down.}

<D>__{he was a disappointment to me, because he wouldn't use his brain. he had so much to offer, but he let it trickle away.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{no he gave it his all, but in a way you could never understand. and all he ever wanted from you was approval. he wanted you to be proud of what he had achieved.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{i kept everything. every record, every article, every photo.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{it's no good telling me. you should have told him.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{i loved him.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{too late...}
<A>__{stanley looks up at phil.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{i understand that you were his right hand man, as well as his friend?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{i was both, yes.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{and that you weren't there when he died? when he needed you most?}
<A>__{a beat, then:}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{yes. that's right.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{so the guilt isn't all mine, then?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{i guess not.}
<A>__{susie walks over and takes phil's hand. stanley says nothing for a moment, but his eyes fill with tears. con tinue d: (3)}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{you boys took away my son. i lost him once in life, and now you're trying to take him from me again.}
<A>__{he starts to cry. larry shoots an imploring look at phil. barbara glances around the room.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{can we just cut through this?}
<A>__{she gestures at phil and larry.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{you two stole the body. theft.}
<A>__{indicates susie.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{sweetie, i'm sorry, but you seem to be in the whole thing up to your neck. accessory.}
<A>__{waves a hand at stanley.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{and you are an old fool who should have called the police, but hasn't. stupidity.}
<A>__{she walks over to the phone.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{now, let's just call the cops and get it done. the sooner we get us a death certificate and bury him, the sooner his soul will be properly laid to rest.}
<A>__{phil walks over to barbara, picks her up and carries her into the bathroom.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{hey! what the hell are you doing?}
<A>__{he emerges and slips the back of a chair under the handle, effectively locking the door.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{son, you had your chance to look after gram, and now he's dead.}
<A>__{there is a 'bang' from the bathroom, and the door shakes. con tinue d: (4)}
<C>__{barbara}
<P>__{(o.s)}
<D>__{bastard!}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{i only failed because i couldn't save him from himself. you failed him all his life. you never believed. i never doubted.}
<A>__{stanley pauses.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{okay. you tell me why i should let you take my boy.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{i was his road manager and his friend. we loved it out here in the desert, and we made a pact that whoever died first, the other would come down here and set them free. gram gave his word and i gave mine.}
<A>__{stanley thinks about this.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{you're a couple of druggies. why should i believe you?}
<A>__{phil doesn't like the inference.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{i don't take drugs.}
<A>__{another 'bang' from the bathroom. stanley turns to larry.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{what about you? are you a druggie?}
<A>__{there is a long pause. then:}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{yes. yes i am.}
<A>__{phil closes his eyes. stanley picks up the receiver and starts to dial. then phil jumps up off the bed and walks out of the room. after a moment, larry and susie follow.}
