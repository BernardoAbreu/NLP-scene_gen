<A>__{jim's car has not moved from its spot on the driveway. its windows are now fogged. a loud garbage truck rumbles by.}
<L>__{interior jim's car continuous}
<A>__{reclined in his car seat, mouth open as he sleeps, jim is awakened by the truck. his breath steams. his eye has turned bluish. he tries to wipe the condensation from the windshield, but it's on the outside.}

<A>__{jim opens the door and looks around no sign of sherry's car. he stiffly walks to the side of the garage and unzips his pants to pee. now cradling his head on the roof of his car, jim gathers what little strength he has, gets in, and tries to start the cold engine.}
