<D>__{eighteen months later. swelling orchestral music. close on jenny cycling, absorbed, happy, the cello strapped to her precariously. the camera pulls back to show her cycling through the streets of oxford. she's done it. we follow her for a little while. she dismounts outside a church and leans the bike against a wall. just as she's about to leave it, she sees something and freezes. we follow her gaze: it's the red bristol, parked a little way down the road just in front of her. she scans the street to see if she can find david. she can he's coming round a corner, a littler further down the street, unwrapping a packet of cigarettes. jenny moves into his eye line. he sees her, stops, then walks towards her.}

<D>__{i can see my behaviour must have been... confusing. but we've never sat down and had a proper chat about it all. about the whys and wherefores. they can wait. the important thing is that you're still my minnie mouse, and i love you, and you had fun. you know you had fun.}

<D>__{look, david. i'm in oxford. every day i wake up and pinch myself. and when i think how close i came...}
<A>__{she looks at him and shakes her head, as if awaking from a dream. a young man stops behind her on his bike, dismounts, leans his bike against the wall next to hers, waits for her to finish. she turns her back on david, and the young man offers her his arm. they walk away together, and david stares longingly after them.}
