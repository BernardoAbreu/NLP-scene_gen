<A>__{he turns to close door, comes face to face with roy batty. sebastian drops his bowl of eggs. batty's hand flashes out and catches it.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{whoops.}
<A>__{smiling, batty hands them back to sebastian, who is too startled to speak. pris runs up and gives batty and mary a big hug, steps back effusing and smiling, everybody's favorite teen ager.}
<C>__{pris}
<D>__{this is my uncle roy, sebastian.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{hello, glad to meet you.}

<C>__{pris}
<D>__{and this is my savior, j.f. sebastian, everybody.}
<A>__{sebastian stands there with his eggs, bashful and ex cited, the hero of this little family's warm attention.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{can't thank you enough, mr. sebastian. if you hadn't come along...}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{we were worried to death. it's awfully kind of you.}
<A>__{sebastian is nodding and smiling.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{we're not used to the big city. where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you certainly have a nice place here.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{well stocked.}
<A>__{batty looks around admiringly. sebastian mumbles some thing that sounds like "thank you."}
<C>__{pris}
<D>__{sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i keep a lot of provisions right here.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{i like a man who stays put. an admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. you live here all by yourself, do you?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{well, no, not really. there's mr. deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.}
<A>__{everybody nods. a long pause.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{we haven't found it easy, mr. sebastian.}
<A>__{they glance around the room, waiting for sebastian to pick up the ball.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{how about breakfast, i was just going to make some.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{if it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{oh, no bother, i'd be glad to.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{well, actually}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{we're famished.}
<A>__{sebastian is truly happy.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{okay, then. you make yourselves comfortable and i will bring the food right out.}
<A>__{he disappears into the kitchen. batty looks happy with the way things are going.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{charming.}
<A>__{pris comes up close. her tone muted but demanding.}
<C>__{pris}
<D>__{well?}
<A>__{batty finds her attitude amusing, which makes her even more pugnacious.}
<C>__{pris}
<D>__{i want to know what's going on.}
<A>__{there's a punitive edge to batty's response.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{there's only three of us left.}
<A>__{pris is shocked. her whisper comes out a hiss.}
<C>__{pris}
<D>__{then we're stupid and we'll die.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{not if everybody is doing their job here at home. how are things at home?}
<A>__{a little spotted pig on the table sits up.}
<C>__{pig}
<D>__{home again, jiggidy jig.}
<A>__{they all turn and stare at the pig. batty is delighted.}
<C>__{pris}
<D>__{i don't trust him. i don't think he knows what he's doing.}
<A>__{the bell tone from the microwave goes off in the kitchen.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{he knows what he's doing.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{if he won't cooperate?}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{mr. sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated. we'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate.}
