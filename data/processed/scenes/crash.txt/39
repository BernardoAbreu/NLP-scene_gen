<A>__{seagrave, a coarse and burly man, wriggles his way behind the wheel of the delicate little race car without acknowledging the cheers of the crowd. he wears james dean clothes a red windbreaker, a white t shirt, jeans, loafers, prescription glasses with clip on sunshades. as he talks, vaughan tours the phalanx of tripod mounted cameras to check their placement, and chats off mike with the pair of cameramen with hand held cameras. he seems to be more the director of the event, possibly the ringmaster, than an actor in it.}

<D>__{i myself shall play the role of james dean's racing mechanic, rolf wutherich, sent over from the porsche factory in zuffenhausen, germany. this mechanic was himself fated to die in a car crash in germany twenty six years later. and the third and in some ways most important party, the college student donald turnupseed, played by movie stuntman brett trask.}
<A>__{trask, slim and wiry, wearing loafers and a blazer, waves his hand and gets into a replica of turnupseed's two tone, black and white 1950 ford sedan. he starts up the ford, which smokes badly, and drives it up the hill about 100 yards.}

<D>__{turnupseed was on his way back to his home in fresno for the weekend. james dean was on his way to an automobile race in salinas, a dusty town in northern california. the two would only meet for one moment, but it was a moment that would create a hollywood legend.}
