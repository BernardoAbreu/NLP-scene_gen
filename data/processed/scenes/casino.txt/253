<A>__{aerial shot of nicky driving.}
<C>__{ace }
<D>__{normally, my prospects of comin' back alive from a meeting with nicky were ninety nine out of a hundred. but this time, when i heard him say, 'a couple a hundred yards down the road', i gave myself fifty fifty.}
<L>__{exterior desert day}
<A>__{ace still standing in the desert. nicky's car suddenly appears as a reflection in ace's sunglasses, shaking ace out of his desert induced reverie. nicky's car pulls up by ace. he gets out and storms up to him.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? goin' over my head?}
<C>__{ace}

<C>__{ace}
<D>__{i didn't do anything. i mean, i didn't order you or anybody... i only told andy stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{you want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{yeah, i said i let the bullshit blow over for a while so i can run the casino. anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. it's not yours, it's my ass.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{oh, i don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because i made that possible!}

<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{your fuckin' ass! you could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television! you wanted to go on tv.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{yeah, i did want to go on tv. that way i have a forum. i can fight back. i'm known. people see me. they know they can't fuck around with me like they could if i was an unknown. that's right.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{you're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{me?! i wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. you brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. i mean, every time i meet somebody here, the big question is do i know you.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{oh, sure. now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{no, it it nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did i tell you? i mean, you asked me, and i knew you were going to come out no matter what i said, but what did i tell you? do you remember what i told...}

<C>__{ace}
<D>__{...you? do you remember what i told you?}
<C>__{nicky}

<D>__{you never ?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{get this through your head, you jew motherfucker, you. you only exist out here because of me! that's the only reason! without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [skell: the lowest form of wiseguy a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' jew ass! then where you gonna go?! you're fuckin' warned! don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! you motherfucker, you!}
<A>__{nicky drives off, leaving an angry and frustrated ace to ponder the desert and the holes.}
