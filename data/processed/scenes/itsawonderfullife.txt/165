<L>__{interior toll house on bridge night}
<A>__{medium shot george, clarence, and the tollkeeper george is seated before a wood burning stove before which his clothes are drying on a line. he is in his long winter underwear. he is sipping a mug of hot coffee, staring at the stove, cold, gloomy and drunk, ignoring clarence and the tollkeeper, preoccupied by his near suicide and his unsolved problems. clarence is standing on the other side of the stove, putting on his undershirt. this is a ludicrous seventeenth century garment which looks like a baby's night shirt with embroidered cuffs and collar, and gathered at the neck with a drawstring. it falls below his knees. the tollkeeper is seated against the wall eyeing them suspiciously. throughout the scene he attempts to spit, but each time is stopped by some amazing thing clarence does or says. clarence becomes aware that his garment is amazing the tollkeeper.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{i didn't have time to get some stylish underwear. my wife gave me this on my last birthday. i passed away in it.}
<A>__{the tollkeeper, about to spit, is stopped in the middle of it by this remark. clarence, secretly trying to get george's attention, now picks up a copy of "tom sawyer" which is hanging on the line, drying. he shakes the book.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{oh, tom sawyer's drying out, too. you should read the new book mark twain's writing now.}
<A>__{the tollkeeper stares at him incredulously.}
<C>__{tollkeeper}
<D>__{how'd you happen to fall in?}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{i didn't fall in. i jumped in to save george.}
<A>__{george looks up, surprised.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you what? to save me?}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{well, i did, didn't i? you didn't go through with it, did you?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{go through with what?}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{suicide.}
<A>__{george and the tollkeeper react to this.}
<C>__{tollkeeper}
<D>__{it's against the law to commit suicide around here.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{yeah, it's against the law where i come from, too.}
<C>__{tollkeeper}
<D>__{where do you come from?}
<A>__{he leans forward to spit, but is stopped by clarence's next statement.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{heaven.}
<P>__{(to george)}
<D>__{i had to act quickly; that's why i jumped in. i knew if i were drowning you'd try to save me. and you see, you did, and that's how i saved you.}
<A>__{the tollkeeper becomes increasingly nervous. george casually looks at the strange smiling little man a second time.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(offhand)}
<D>__{very funny.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{your lip's bleeding, george.}
<A>__{george's hand goes to his mouth.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yeah, i got a bust in the jaw in answer to a prayer a little bit ago.}
<C>__{clarence}
<P>__{(comes around to george)}
<D>__{oh, no no no. i'm the answer to your prayer. that's why i was sent down here.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(casually interested)}
<D>__{how do you know my name?}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{oh, i know all about you. i've watched you grow up from a little boy.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what are you, a mind reader or something?}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{oh, no.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well, who are you, then?}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{clarence odbody, a s 2.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{odbody... a s 2. what's that a s 2?}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{angel, second class.}
<A>__{the tollkeeper's chair slips out from under him with a crash. he has been leaning against the wall on it, tipped back on two legs. tollkeeper rises and makes his way warily out the door. from his expression he looks like he'll call the nearest cop.}
<C>__{clarence}
<P>__{(to tollkeeper)}
<D>__{cheerio, my good man.}
<A>__{george rubs his head with his hand, to clear his mind.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh, brother. i wonder what martini put in those drinks?}
<A>__{he looks up at clarence standing beside him.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{hey, what's with you? what did you say just a minute ago? why'd you want to save me?}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{that's what i was sent down for. i'm your guardian angel.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i wouldn't be a bit surprised.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. eight thousand dollars.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(bewildered)}
<D>__{yeah... just things like that. now how'd you know that?}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{i told you i'm your guardian angel. i know everything about you.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well, you look about like the kind of an angel i'd get. sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? what happened to your wings?}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{i haven't won my wings yet. that's why i'm an angel second class.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i don't know whether i like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{oh, i've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(humoring him)}
<D>__{sure, sure. how?}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{by letting me help you.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{only one way you can help me. you don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{oh, no, no. we don't use money in heaven.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh, that's right, i keep forgetting. comes in pretty handy down here, bub.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{oh, tut, tut, tut.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i found it out a little late. i'm worth more dead than alive.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{now look, you mustn't talk like that. i won't get my wings with that attitude. you just don't know all that you've done. if it hadn't been for you...}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(interrupts)}
<D>__{yeah, if it hadn't been for me, everybody'd be a lot better off. my wife, and my kids and my friends.}
<P>__{(annoyed with clarence)}
<D>__{look, little fellow, go off and haunt somebody else, will you?}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{no, you don't understand. i've got my job...}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(savagely)}
<D>__{aw, shut up, will you.}
<A>__{clarence is not getting far with george. he glances up, paces across the room, thoughtfully.}
<C>__{clarence}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{hmmm, this isn't going to be so easy.}
<P>__{(to george)}
<D>__{so you still think killing yourself would make everyone feel happier, eh?}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(dejectedly)}
<D>__{oh, i don't know. i guess you're right. i suppose it would have been better if i'd never been born at all.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{what'd you say?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i said i wish i'd never been born.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{oh, you mustn't say things like that. you...}
<P>__{(gets an idea)}
<D>__{...wait a minute. wait a minute. that's an idea.}
<P>__{(glances up toward heaven)}
<D>__{what do you think? yeah, that'll do it. all right.}
<P>__{(to george)}
<D>__{you've got your wish. you've never been born.}
<A>__{as clarence speaks this line, the snow stops falling outside the building, a strong wind springs up which blows open the door to the shack. clarence runs to close the door.}
<C>__{clarence}
<P>__{(looking upward)}
<D>__{you don't have to make all that fuss about it.}
<A>__{as clarence speaks, george cocks his head curiously, favoring his deaf ear, more interested in his hearing than in what clarence has said.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{you've never been born. you don't exist. you haven't a care in the world.}
<A>__{george feels his ear as clarence talks.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{no worries no obligations no eight thousand dollars to get no potter looking for you with the sheriff.}
<B>__{closeup george and clarence}
<A>__{george indicates his bad ear.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{say something else in that ear.}
<C>__{clarence}
<P>__{(bending down)}
<D>__{sure. you can hear out of it.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well, that's the doggonedest thing... i haven't heard anything out of that ear since i was a kid. must have been that jump in the cold water.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{your lip's stopped bleeding, too, george.}
<A>__{george feels his lip, which shows no sign of the recent cut he received from welch. he is now thoroughly confused.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what do you know about that... what's happened?}
<C>__{medium close shot}
<D>__{george looks around, as though to get his bearings.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? what's happened here?}
<P>__{(standing up)}
<D>__{come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry...}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{our clothes are dry.}
<A>__{george feels the clothes on the line.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what do you know about that? stove's hotter than i thought. now, come on, get your clothes on, and we'll stroll up to my car and get...}
<A>__{they start dressing. george interrupts himself.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry. i will stroll. you fly.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{i can't fly. i haven't got any wings.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you haven't got your wings. yeah, that's right.}
