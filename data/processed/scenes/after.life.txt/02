<L>__{interior paul's apartment. bathroom moments later}
<A>__{through the fogged shower partition we see the blurred ghostly figure of anna. paul walks in.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{anna. i'm sorry. that was a stupid thing to say. but you know sometimes... sometimes it's like you're not here anymore. like you're somewhere else.}
<A>__{anna doesn't reply.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{is this about us?}
<B>__{on anna}
<A>__{her head bowed as she lets the water wash over her.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's not about us.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{then what is it?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{i just want us to be happy.}
<A>__{anna doesn't move. we sense the emptiness inside her.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{are you happy?}
<A>__{she closes her eyes. forces herself to reply.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i'm happy.}
<B>__{a drop of blood}
<A>__{falls into the water. then another drop.}
<B>__{on anna}
<A>__{her nose is bleeding. she touches her lips. looks impassively at the blood on her fingertips. the sound of water carries into the next scene...}
