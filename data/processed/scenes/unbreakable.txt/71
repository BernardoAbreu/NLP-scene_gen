<A>__{elijah's walking stick makes rhythmic clicks on the concrete parking lot. the figure in the army jacket seems to move farther away with every step. elijah starts breathing harder. he pushes himself to move faster. he avoids the hard chrome bumpers and tailpipes that jut out from the cars as he quickens his pace through the lot. he gains on the army jacket.}

<D>__{hold up for a second!}
<A>__{the man in the army jacket turns as he reaches a subway entrance that marks the end of the parking lot. he looks back at elijah for a beat. doesn't like what he sees. he disappears into the subway entrance. elijah quickens into a jog now. he hasn't done this in a while and it's painful. he makes it with great strain to the subway. he looks into the entrance... a steep flight of stairs leads to the subway floor. the tail of the army jacket is glimpsed before it disappears. elijah breathes hard as he takes hold of the railing.}

<D>__{i just want to ask you something!}
<A>__{elijah's voice echoes down the stairs. no response. elijah starts his descent.}
<B>__{the sound of a subway pulling in roars up the stairs.}
<A>__{elijah has to move fast. he takes the steps with less and less hesitation. he's moving with great agility... and then his foot catches on a step. his hand slips away from the railing... he falls down the remaining part of the stairs. the first sickening crack is heard when his hand reaches out to stop his fall. the second crack is more like a crunch as his leg lands awkwardly on the metal}

<A>__{he comes to a stop in a pile on the dirty gum stained floor of the subway landing. his jaw is locked in a horrific scream that gets eaten by the roar of}

<A>__{his contorted anguished face sees the turnstiles of the subway upside down. the green army jacketed man looks back at elijah with a blank expression pushing through the turnstile. the last thing elijah sees before he blacks out, is the tail of the man's coat riding up as he move through the turnstile. the silver handle of a gun peeks out from the belt of his pants.}
