<L>__{exterior ice field day}
<A>__{all three get cold cocked by an invisible wind. carrie steps away from the cat. pryce does too. her eyes scan the ice with cool appraisal. it's completely flat. desert like.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{you sure this is right?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{section 104. these are the coordinates.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{maybe you wrote them down wrong.}
<A>__{carrie ignores him. walks further away from the cat. ice crunches under her feet as she keeps looking then, she stops. something's not right. looks down. kneels to the ice. scoops some up. checks it out. perplexed. pryce approaches from behind.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{this is shaved ice.}
<A>__{she gets to her feet. walks further her eyes now paying close attention to the texture of the ice. after a dozen steps, texture changes. ice is now smooth like it's supposed to be. she turns around. tries to get the bigger picture. looks at the ground all around her. realizes a large area has been blanketed with shaved pieces of ice a few inches thick }
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{they were digging, pryce. and they tries to spread the ice to hide it.}
<A>__{she heads back across the area. scans the horizon. takes another step forward. whoosh! in an instant, carrie's gone! disappears below the ice. only a four foot wide hole remains, that was covered up with a white, iced over tarp. pryce and delfy move toward her each hesitating slightly, unsure of their own footing. pryce gets to the hole. looks down. carrie is precariously dangling in an ice shaft that slopes at a slight angle. she's managed to grasp a protruding piece of ice, but she's fighting the pain in her left hand to hold on. it slips off. below her nothing but darkness.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{grab me!}
<A>__{pryce lays flat. reaches his hand down six inches too short. delfy appears from behind.}
<C>__{pryce}
<P>__{(to delfy)}
<D>__{hold my legs!}
<A>__{delfy does. pryce inches closer.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i'm slipping!}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{almost got you.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i'm losing my grip.}
<A>__{he gets closer. closer. moves to within an inch from hers she slips. falls away. things become silent.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{carrie? can you hear me?}
<A>__{delfy peers over pryce's shoulder into the abyss.}
<C>__{delfy}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{marshal?}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{...i'm okay.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{saw a rope in the cat.}
<A>__{delfy springs to his feet.}
