<L>__{interior mary in shower}
<A>__{over the bar on which hangs the shower curtain, we can see the bathroom door, not entirely closed. for a moment we watch mary as she washes and soaps herself. there is still a small worry in her eyes, but generally she looks somewhat relieved. now we see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open. the noise of the shower drowns out any sound. the door is then slowly and carefully closed. and we see the shadow of a woman fall across the shower curtain. mary's back is turned to the curtain. the white brightness of the bathroom is almost blinding. suddenly we see the hand reach up, grasp the shower curtain, rip it aside.}
