<ACTION>__{Window, very small in the distance, illuminated. All around this is an almost totally black screen.  Now, as the camera moves slowly towards the window which is almost a postage stamp in the frame, other forms appear; barbed wire, cyclone fencing, and now, looming up against an early morning sky, enormous iron grille work.  Camera travels up what is now shown to be a gateway of gigantic proportions and holds on the top of it - a huge initial "K" showing darker and darker against the dawn sky.  Through this and beyond we see the fairy-tale mountaintop of Xanadu, the great castle a sillhouette as its summit, the little window a distant accent in the darkness.}

<ACTION>__{The literally incredible domain of CHARLES FOSTER KANE. Its right flank resting for nearly forty miles on the Gulf Coast, it truly extends in all directions farther than the eye can see.  Designed by nature to be almost completely bare and flat - it was, as will develop, practically all marshland when Kane acquired and changed its face - it is now pleasantly uneven, with its fair share of rolling hills and one very good- sized mountain, all man-made.  Almost all the land is improved, either through cultivation for farming purposes of through careful landscaping, in the shape of parks and lakes.  The castle dominates itself, an enormous pile, compounded of several genuine castles, of European origin, of varying architecture - dominates the scene, from the very peak of the mountain.}

<ACTION>__{GOLF LINKS (MINIATURE) Past which we move.  The greens are straggly and overgrown, the fairways wild with tropical weeds, the links unused and not seriously tended for a long time.}

<ACTION>__{WHAT WAS ONCE A GOOD-SIZED ZOO (MINIATURE) Of the Hagenbeck type.  All that now remains, with one exception, are the individual plots, surrounded by moats, on which the animals are kept, free and yet safe from each other and the landscape at large.  (Signs on several of the plots indicate that here there were once tigers, lions, girrafes.)}

<ACTION>__{THE MONKEY TERRACE (MINIATURE) In the foreground, a great obscene ape is outlined against the dawn murk.  He is scratching himself slowly, thoughtfully, looking out across the estates of Charles Foster Kane, to the distant light glowing in the castle on the hill.}

As it moves across the frame, it discloses again the reflection of the window in the castle, closer than before. THE GREAT SWIMMING POOL (MINIATURE) It is empty.  A newspaper blows across the cracked floor of the tank.}

<ACTION>__{A DRAWBRIDGE (MINIATURE) Over a wide moat, now stagnant and choked with weeds.  We move across it and through a huge solid gateway into a formal garden, perhaps thirty yards wide and one hundred yards deep, which extends right up to the very wall of the castle.  The landscaping surrounding it has been sloppy and causal for a long time, but this particular garden has been kept up in perfect shape.  As the camera makes its way through it, towards the lighted window of the castle, there are revealed rare and exotic blooms of all kinds.  The dominating note is one of almost exaggerated tropical lushness, hanging limp and despairing.  Moss, moss, moss.  Ankor Wat, the night the last King died.}

<ACTION>__{THE WINDOW (MINIATURE) Camera moves in until the frame of the window fills the frame of the screen.  Suddenly, the light within goes out.  This stops the action of the camera and cuts the music which has been accompanying the sequence.

<ACTION>__{The camera pulls back, showing the whole scene to be contained in one of those glass balls which are sold in novelty stores all over the world.  A hand - Kane's hand, which has been holding the ball, relaxes.  The ball falls out of his hand and bounds down two carpeted steps leading to the bed, the camera following.  The ball falls off the last step onto the marble floor where it breaks, the fragments glittering in the first rays of the morning sun.  This ray cuts an angular pattern across the floor, suddenly crossed with a thousand bars of light as the blinds are pulled across the window. The foot of Kane's bed.  The camera very close.  Outlined against the shuttered window, we can see a form - the form of a nurse, as she pulls the sheet up over his head.  The camera follows this action up the length of the bed and arrives at the face after the sheet has covered it.}

<CHAR>__{THOMPSON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{What's that?}
<CHAR>__{RAYMOND} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's a jigsaw puzzle.}
<CHAR>__{THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We got a lot of those.  There's a Burmese Temple and three Spanish ceilings down the hall.}

<DIAL>__{Yeah, all in crates.}

<CHAR>__{RAYMOND} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{PHOTOGRAPHER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(to the Third Newspaperman)}

<CHAR>__{THOMPSON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, I didn't.}
<ACTION>__{The music has stopped.  The dancers have come over to Thompson.}
<CHAR>__{SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Say, what did you find out about him, anyway, Jerry?}
<CHAR>__{THOMPSON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not much.}
<CHAR>__{SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, what have you been doing?}
<CHAR>__{THOMPSON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Playing with a jigsaw puzzle -   I talked to a lot of people who knew him.}
<CHAR>__{GIRL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What do they say?}
<CHAR>__{THOMPSON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well - it's become a very clear picture.  He was the most honest man who ever lived, with a streak of crookedness a yard wide.  He was a liberal and a reactionary; he was tolerant - "Live and Let Live" - that was his motto.  But he had no use for anybody who disagreed with him on any point, no matter how small it was.  He was a loving husband and a good father - and both his wives left him and his son got himself killed about as shabbily as you can do it.  He had a gift for friendship such as few men have - he broke his oldest friend's heart like you'd throw away a cigarette you were through with.  Outside of that -}
<CHAR>__{THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay, okay.}
<CHAR>__{GIRL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What about Rosebud?  Don't you think that explains anything?}
<CHAR>__{THOMPSON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, I don't.  Not much anway. Charles Foster Kane was a man who got everything he wanted, and then lost it.  Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get or lost. No, I don't think it explains anything.  I don't think any word explains a man's life.  No -  I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle - a missing piece.}
<ACTION>__{He drops the jigsaw pieces back into the box, looking at his watch.}
<CHAR>__{THOMPSON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We'd better get along.  We'll miss the train.}
<ACTION>__{He picks up his overcoat - it has been resting on a little sled - the little sled young Charles Foster Kane hit Thatcher with at the opening of the picture.  Camera doesn't close in on this.  It just registers the sled as the newspaper people, picking up their clothes and equipment, move out of the great hall.}

<CHAR>__{RAYMOND} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Throw that junk in, too.}
<ACTION>__{Camera travels to the pile that he has indicated.  It is mostly bits of broken packing cases, excelsior, etc.  The sled is on top of the pile.  As camera comes close, it shows the faded rosebud and, though the letters are faded, unmistakably the word "ROSEBUD" across it.  The laborer drops his shovel, takes the sled in his hand and throws it into the furnace.  The flames start to devour it.}
<LOC>__{EXT. XANADU - NIGHT -}
<ACTION>__{No lights are to be seen.  Smoke is coming from a chimney. Camera reverses the path it took at the beginning of the picture, perhaps omitting some of the stages.  It moves finally through the gates, which close behind it.  As camera pauses for a moment, the letter "K" is prominent in the moonlight. Just before we fade out, there comes again into the picture the pattern of barbed wire and cyclone fencing.  On the fence is a sign which reads: "PRIVATE - NO TRESPASSING"}
