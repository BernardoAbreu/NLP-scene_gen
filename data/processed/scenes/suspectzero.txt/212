<L>__{interior o'ryan room continuing}
<A>__{fran enters, feeling slightly dirty from that exchange. mackelway checks his watch as a few agents exit the suite.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{they going to denton?}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{mmm hmm.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{but not you?}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{sitting in on two autopsies.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{he rises. heads for the door, stiff. she looks at those o'ryan fbi documents now her first time seeing them...}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{yeah. why?}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{she leaves it at that. he's about to exit, when:}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{are they male or female?}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{the autopsies.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{females logan, utah; and decatur, alabama.}
<A>__{(neither city is represented with black pins on that map.) she slides over a packet of photos: two female victims, photographed in separate morgues face up, face down, waist and above, waist and below, etc. mackelway eyes them, then leaves the room. we stay with fran... taking in that o'ryan fbi file. it troubles her. mackelway returns, carrying the 9 by 12 envelope that katie gave to him.}
<C>__{fran }
<P>__{(re: o'ryan's file)}
<D>__{so is this what happens when an agent spins out? he gets deleted?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{sometimes. the lucky ones get sent to wichita falls.}
<A>__{she breathes out an ironic laugh. he hands over the envelope, opens it. inside: that photo of karen sumpter. mackelway didn't pay much attention to it before. fran eyes the photo, then the vitals.}
<C>__{mackelway }
<D>__{friend of the receptionist, missing for about a year now. i told her i'd let her know if the body ever turned up.}
<A>__{fran doesn't look up from the photo.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{the receptionist.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{her name's katie.}
<A>__{she half smiles: "you mean the one you've been fucking?" he shrugs, confirming nothing wishing fran weren't quite so smart. she puts the photo back into the envelope.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i see you got the blue pin out of greenville.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{yeah. last night. kid named simms.}

<D>__{no. i meant her. the girl.}
<A>__{that confused him.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{what're you talking about?}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{did ya look at her vitals?}
<A>__{she hands him the material on karen sumpter.}
