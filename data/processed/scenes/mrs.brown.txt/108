<L>__{exterior lochnager day}
<A>__{an hour later, brown leads disraeli up the hill. brown has his head down, on with the job. disraeli slows to a halt.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{princes and lords are but the breath of kings, an honest man's the noblest work of god.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you must miss such magnificent views.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i don't think about it.}
<A>__{they reach the top and continue along the high ground. disraeli glances at brown and notices the limp.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{forgive me, i've called you out and you should have been resting.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{you're injured.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{it's nothing.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{still, someone must attend you. your wife should not have let you out.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i'm not married.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{this is the top.}
<A>__{disraeli admires the view for a moment, then continues.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{i confess, i sometimes feel as if i am not married myself, i see my wife so little. but i'm forgetting the rewards.}
<A>__{he looks across. brown keeps staring ahead.}
<C>__{disraeli }
<D>__{the look on their faces when one walks into the room. still gives one a ridiculous thrill.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i wouldn't know.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{surely }
<C>__{brown}
<P>__{(interrupts)}
<D>__{what i do, i do for my queen.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{was there never ambition?}
<C>__{brown}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{maybe, once.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{then i envy yo.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{to have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i do what i do.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{for her majesty.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{aye.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{but yourself?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what about john brown?}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i said.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i serve the queen.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{no other aspiration?}
<A>__{brown stares for a long moment. finally he speaks.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{to see her safe.}
<A>__{disraeli steps a little closer.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{you will not be unaware of the threat now posed by republicanism.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{why do you think i keep her here?}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{ah, but therein lies the paradox. it is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents. the longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that? however many doors you lock, someone will always get in. even here.}
<A>__{brown watches him, eyes alert.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{so...?}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{the truth is, the queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public. john bull loves her and john bull is her best defense.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{her mind is set. she won't change now.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{she trusts you, john.}
<A>__{disraeli is right on his shoulder now, like his own voice.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{they don't see it.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{see what?}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{the threat.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i tell them, but they don't see it.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{they aren't as watchful as you.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{too busy looking after themselves.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{the greasy pole.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{no loyalty.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{no love.}
<A>__{silence. for a moment brown seems unaware that someone else has said that.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i promised to protect her from people like you.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{for once in my life, i am not the issue.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{she'll never understand it.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{in time, she will.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{she'll think i betrayed her.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{but others will know that you acted for the greater good.}
<A>__{brown stares off into the distance.}
