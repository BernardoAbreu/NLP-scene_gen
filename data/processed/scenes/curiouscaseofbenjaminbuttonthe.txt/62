<L>__{interior back stairwell, nolan house late night, 1930}
<A>__{the old house still. daisy, moving quietly down the stairs. benjamin, his cane softly thumping the steps, following her.}
<C>__{benjamin}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{where are we going?}
<A>__{she doesn't say anything. she leads him into the dining room... where we see the wash has been draped, sheets and pillowcases, like ghosts over the dining room table, and a smaller side table, and a buffet...to dry...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{under here...}
<A>__{and she ducks under a sheet, beneath the dining table... benjamin follows her into the "fort..."}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{nobody knows about this but us.}
<A>__{they sit... the little girl, and the old man with the maturity of a ten year old boy, enjoying their secret lair... she takes a candle out of the folds of her nightgown... she tries to light it, but doesn't really know how to use matches...}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{will you light it?}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{i'm not supposed to use matches...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{don't be chicken...}
<A>__{despite his caution, he lights the candle... the candlelight making it feel more secret...}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{i will tell you a secret then you tell me one...}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{i saw mommy kissing another man. her face was red from it.}
<A>__{benjamin doesn't know what to say.}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{your turn to tell.}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{i'm younger than i look.}
<C>__{daisy}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{you don't seem like an old person... like my grandma... are you sick?}
<C>__{benjamin}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{i heard tizzy and my mother whisper. they said i was going to die soon.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{but i fooled them so far.}
<A>__{daisy looks at him in the flickering candlelight.}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{you are different than anybody i have ever met. can i?}
<A>__{she innocently reaches to touch the skin on his cheek to see what it feels like... when suddenly a sheet is pulled back and daisy's grandmother is standing there.}
<C>__{grandma fuller}
<D>__{what are you doing under there? who's idea was this candle?}
<A>__{she angrily blows it out... and... to daisy... taking her by the arm...}
<C>__{grandma fuller }
<D>__{it's after midnight, you come right out here and get back up to bed...!}
<P>__{(and for benjamin,}
<D>__{but saying it to}
<P>__{daisy)}
<D>__{you are not to be playing together! play with people your own age...!}
<P>__{(moving her along)}
<D>__{now, you come back to bed, young lady...! you're too young to be wandering around in the night by yourself...}
<P>__{(and a last word to benjamin)}
<D>__{you should be ashamed of yourself!}
<A>__{and they're gone... benjamin left sitting along under the sheets. there's a slight sound and he sees queenie, in her nightgown, standing in the doorway...}
<C>__{queenie}
<D>__{you are a different child... a man child. people aren't going to understand how different you are.}
<C>__{benjamin}
<P>__{(forlorn)}
<D>__{what's wrong with me, mother?}
<C>__{queenie}
<D>__{god hasn't said yet. now, back to bed and behave yourself.}
<A>__{he crosses up the back stairs with the aid of his cane, and mr. oti, like a spectre, is sitting on one end of the back steps smoking a cigarette, drinking form his flask. he looks at benjamin as he goes by.}
<C>__{ngunda oti}
<P>__{(takes a drink)}
<D>__{you get used to it...}
<C>__{queenie }
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{you get back in that bed or i will cane your old ass!}
<A>__{benjamin turns down the hallway and slips into the bedroom }
