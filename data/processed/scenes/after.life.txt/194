<L>__{exterior road night}
<A>__{eliot's white van sits by the side of the road.}
<L>__{exterior cemetery. parking lot night}
<A>__{paul's car slams to a halt. he jumps out. in the distance the candles still burn on anna's grave.}
<L>__{exterior cemetery. anna's grave moments later}
<A>__{paul grabs a shovel by the grave. starts digging. then the shovel clunks against wood. he kneels down. scrapes away the earth from the coffin. then pulls open the lid. anna's eyes are wide open. her fingernails torn and bloody. paul grabs her shoulders. pulls her out of the grave. her body slumps limply like a rag doll.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{anna. i'm here. please god. anna.}
<A>__{he desperately tries to revive her. but there's no life left in her. he's about to give up when... anna's hand twitches. then after a moment she gasps. her eyes slowly focus on paul.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{paul?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{baby. thank god.}
<A>__{paul gently helps anna to her feet. she looks round. dazed. turns back to paul.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you came back for me.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i came back for you. you're safe now.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{promise?}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{promise.}
<A>__{just then paul hears a rustling sound behind him. he turns. nothing. he cocks his head slightly. there's something unnerving about the silence. suddenly a crow rises noisily into the air. paul starts. then watches, relieved, as the crow disappears into the dark sky. he turns back to anna... she's not there.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{anna?}
<A>__{paul looks round desperately. runs between the stone crosses and statues of grieving angels searching for her.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{anna!}
<A>__{just then he glimpses something move among the trees. runs over. nothing. the cemetery is empty. the trees appear to shimmer for a moment. paul shivers. pulls his jacket around him. he doesn't notice the candles on anna's grave behind him suddenly blow out.}
