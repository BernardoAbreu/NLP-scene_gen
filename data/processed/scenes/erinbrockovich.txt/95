<L>__{interior masry & vititoe, main room day}
<A>__{ed and erin come out and see david baum waiting at reception. forget law school, this kid looks like he's just out of twelfth grade. not a hair on his chin. his suit and shoes look brand new.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{not to question your judgment or anything, mr. masry, but that doesn't exactly look like sitting up and taking notice to me.}
<L>__{interior masry & vititoe, conference room day}
<A>__{ed and erin are seated across the table from baum. to say this kid lacks authority is a gross understatement. he doesn't talk; he squeaks.}
<C>__{baum}
<D>__{... in the interest of putting this whole thing to rest, pg&e is willing to offer the irvings 250,000 dollars for their home.}
<A>__{ed laughs a little in disbelief.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{250,000?}
<C>__{baum}
<D>__{in terms of land value out in hinkley, mr. masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{what about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.}
<C>__{baum}
<D>__{i understand they've had a bad run of luck, health wise, and they have my sympathies. but that's not pg&e's fault.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{you're kidding, right?}
<P>__{(baum doesn't answer)}
<D>__{look at these readings for christ's sake. pg&e's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells, on numerous occasions.}
<A>__{ed shoves them across the table. baum doesn't look at them.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{everything the irvings have had is a proven reaction to exposure to hexavalent chromium. they've had ...}
<A>__{he stalls a moment. erin jumps in.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{ breast cysts, uterine cancer, hodgkin's disease, immune deficiencies, asthma, chronic nosebleeds.}
<A>__{despite their persuasiveness, baum parrots what is obviously the party line:}
<C>__{baum}
<D>__{a million things could have caused those problems. poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle. our offer is final and more than fair.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{wait a minute i thought we were negotiating here.}
<C>__{baum}
<D>__{250,000 is all i'm authorized to offer.}
<A>__{ed looks across at this pissant little kid.}
<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{jesus christ.}
<P>__{(he stands, to leave)}
<D>__{i will present your offer to my clients. i doubt they'll accept it.}
<A>__{as ed starts out:}
<C>__{baum}
<D>__{mr. masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here. pg&e is a 28 billion dollar corporation.}
<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(containing his anger)}
<D>__{thanks. i will keep it in mind.}
<A>__{and ed leaves the conference room. erin follows him out.}
