<L>__{interior main doors night}
<A>__{st. luc has made his way to the main doors and stands talking to the rental agent, merrick, who is leaning against the intercom board with the doorman's pocketbook romance in one hand. the agent looks perfectly normal, though he keeps wiping his mouth unobtrusively with the back of his hand.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{...haven't seen anything that looks like trouble at all. just filling in for walter... the doorman. but if you want me to call the police, i will.}
<A>__{st. luc is cautious but he seems to believe merrick. he presses the button which buzzes the spergazzi apartment. nobody answers. a middle aged man walks in. worried, st. luc buzzes again.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{apartment 307? visiting my sister.}
<A>__{merrick smiles and opens the door for the man, who goes in and takes the stairway up, preferring to walk. the intercom squawks and spergazzi answers the buzzer.}
<C>__{mr. spergazzi}
<D>__{yes? who is there?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{it's dr. st. luc, mr spergazzi. let me speak to the nurse, please.}
<C>__{mr. spergazzi }
<D>__{oh, but the nurse, she went away. i think she must go to look for you.}
<A>__{st. luc curses under his breath and makes a move toward the door. merrick smiles and pulls it open for him. st. luc disappears down the stairs leading to the incinerator. as the stairway doors close, the elevators slide open and a young couple come out heading for the main doors, dressed to go out to a late party. before they reach the doors, merrick slips through them and meets the couple in the lobby. he smiles broadly as he approaches them.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{evening, mr. wolf, miss lewis. i wonder if i could talk to you for a second in my office?}
<C>__{miss lewis}
<D>__{why don't you do something about all that noise? we like parties, but this is ridiculous.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{well, there may be a connection. see, it's about your locker. 'fraid somebody busted into it tonight.}
<C>__{miss lewis and mr wolf}
<P>__{(together)}
<D>__{oh, no! what a drag!}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{'fraid so. i've got a few of the things they threw around in my office and if you could identify it...}
<A>__{the couple turn, grumbling, and walk toward merrick's office. merrick follows, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.}
