<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i got an idea what happened.}
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i think somewhere between roderick bledsoe's club and his house, wade ran into buddy deeds. i think buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the sheriff's car and drove him out by the army post, i think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back.}
