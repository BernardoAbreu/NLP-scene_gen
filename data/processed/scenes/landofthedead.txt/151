<A>__{footsteps echo as knipp, carrying one of the prada duffles, helps the wounded kaufman across an underground parking garage, a dark and spooky place, made more so by the sounds of distant screaming. kaufman disdainfully snaps off the shanks of the arrows in his leg and shoulder. the two men reach a stretch lincoln. knipp beeps the doors open and they get inside, knipp behind the wheel, kaufman in the luxurious back compartment, where he pours himself a scotch from the built in bar. knipp starts the engine. the sound echoes big time in the concrete tomb.}

<A>__{kaufman moans. knipp steers the car slowly, carefully through the shadows, pulling in beside a gasoline pump near the base of a ramp that leads up to the street. knipp pushes a button that pops open the gas tank. he shuts the engine off and gets out, taking the keys, which have a mag card attached to them.}

<A>__{e slides the mag card into a slot, activating the pump. an led scrolls "thank you, mr. kaufman". knipp pulls the nozzle. freezes when he hears... ...footsteps echoing. a dark figure is approaching through the shadows. nipp drops the nozzle. ducks into the car. slams the door. wham! a single hand smacks against the driver side window. a face leans in behind the hand. a face full of rage. big daddy's face.}

<A>__{big daddy moves to one of the rear windows. he can't see inside. the window is tinted. he returns to the clear windshield, looks back, at an angle, and sees kaufman in the rear compartment. big daddy recognizes him. from upstairs. it's the man who shot him. the dead thing looks up. sees the gasoline pump. his hand drops to the embroidery on its jump suit..."texaco". he moves deliberately toward the pump.}

<A>__{big daddy sees the nozzle on the cement. picks it up, feeling the familiarity of it. pulls the trigger. gasoline squirts. the rage in his face turns to a kind of satisfaction. using the nozzle as he did the pneumatic hammer, big daddy pounds on the windshield, three times, before the safety glass cobwebs. he pokes the nozzle through the flexible fabric and pulls the trigger until it locks. gasoline floods into the car.}
