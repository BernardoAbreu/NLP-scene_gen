<L>__{interior volleyball court day}
<D>__{in an indoor volleyball court with bleachers, several japanese girls play volleyball. they all compete intensely for the pointerior there is excitement, but everything occurs quietly. a player jumps and spikes the ball. chieko (16), tall, beautiful, with strands of hair painted purple, volleys the ball back up. it reaches one of her teammates who sets up another to spike it. chieko's team wins the pointerior the referee, instead of whistling, lifts up a red flag. the players congratulate each other silently, in sign language. the only sound we can here is the parents' clapping as they watch the game from the stands. chieko's team serves. again, the game is heated. a rival player spikes the ball, and it is barely out of bounds. however, the referee, with his red flag, calls the pointerior chieko is upset and goes to argue with him.}
