<A>__{the five tuxedo clad bodyguards hit the hallway, only to see....bill, with his hanzo sword unsheathed, standing at the end. this wasn't expected, they unsheath their swords. he charges at them. in the hotel's hallway, bill cuts through the five men. his mastery of the hanzo sword in his hand is peerless. he cuts through the first four rather quickly. the fifth one, alburt, is the most skilled, but he too falls under the master's blade.}
