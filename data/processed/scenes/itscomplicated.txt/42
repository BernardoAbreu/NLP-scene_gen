<L>__{interior jane's bathroom}
<A>__{jane takes a bubble bath. jake lies on the floor, leaning against the tub, his back to her, eating a bowl of ice cream.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{maybe we should be growing old together.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{hate to tell you, big guy, but we already grew old apart.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{what's with the `big guy'? is that because you think i'm fat or is it a term of endearment?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i have no idea why i keep saying that. i'm sorry. i will stop.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i love how quiet it is in your house. i have no quiet in my life. ever.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{yeah, well, you live with a five year old.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{yes...and don't forget pedro.}
<A>__{jane splashes him.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{so what does that mean exactly...? what's going on over there at your place?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{my marriage is... not turning out as i hoped. that's obvious.... agness started out really looking up to me... we never used to fight but now... with the kid....lately we're all about where he's gonna go to school and now she says we need a bigger house, more help. i was thinking of cutting back at work... now that's never gonna happen. and she wants another baby before pedro gets too old which i get but since we're always fighting... oh, god, listen to me.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{isn't a baby part of the deal when you marry a woman that age?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{is it? i guess so. she's got me booked at the fertility center every other day and she's so amped up on hormone injections i may need to find an exorcist if she doesn't calm down.}
<P>__{(jane laughs)}
<D>__{i wish it was funny.}
<P>__{(finishes his ice cream)}
<D>__{incredible ice cream. i'm turning around...}
<P>__{(as he turns, jane shrinks in the tub)}
<D>__{remember when we used to smoke pot and eat your ice cream in the hot tub?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{the "hot tub"... that feels like a billion years ago.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{how long has it been since you...}
<P>__{(indicates smoking a joint)}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{me? since before lauren was born.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{27 years?!!}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{at least.}
<A>__{jake slips a joint out of his shirt pocket, twirls it.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{are you kidding me? put that away! it's been too long...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{exactly.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i'm not going to....}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{okay, why don't i leave this with}
<P>__{you... (it's kind of amazing.)}
<D>__{maybe you'll take a few hits...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{get your sea legs, then we'll smoke the rest of it together.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{maybe....}
<A>__{jake places the joint in a drawer.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{so that nerdy architect likes you...you know that, right?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{he's not nerdy and he definitely doesn't. we're working together.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i was watching when you bent down to open the oven, his eyes were glued to your ass.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(changing the subject)}
<D>__{hey, will you do me a favor?}
