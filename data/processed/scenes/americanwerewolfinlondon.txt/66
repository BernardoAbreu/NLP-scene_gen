<L>__{interior alex's bathroom night}
<A>__{david lifts the toilet seat and pees. he winces, hoping the steady stream doesn't awaken alex. when he's finished peeing he goes to the sink. the medicine cabinet door over the sink is open. when david closes it he (and the audience) is terrified to see jack reflected standing behind him. (note: this is a big scare.) bloodied and horrible, jack has continued to rot and looks even worse than when we last saw him. david chokes out a strangled cry, closes his eyes tightly and then reopens them. jack is still there in the mirror. when david turns around jack is standing in the doorway.}
