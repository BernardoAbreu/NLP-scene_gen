<D>__{"...we'll meet again."}
<A>__{a small creek emptying into a stream runs parallel to the road. needy seems something glinting at the mouth of the creek and stoops to pick it up. it's nikolai's bowie knife, the one he threw into devil's kettle, never to be seen again. needy picks it up and tucks it into her waistband. a station wagon comes rattling up the road. needy sticks her thumb out again. the wagon pulls over to the side of the road. the driver, a grizzled older man, rolls down the window. he eyes needy lasciviously.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{where you looking to go, young lady?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{east, toward madison.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{east, huh? guess i'm headed that way. but i'm gonna need you to pay me in ass, gas or grass. got that? no free rides in this wagon.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{i don't have any money or drugs, so you'll have to settle for ass.}

<B>__{shoulder.}
<A>__{we hear the song on the radio end, segueing into the dj's bumper.}
<C>__{radio dj}
<D>__{what a song. thought we'd play that one in honor of soft shoulder. they're playing in madison tonight. should be a night to remember...}
