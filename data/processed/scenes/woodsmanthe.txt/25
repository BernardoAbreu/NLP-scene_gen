<L>__{interior walter's apartment night}
<A>__{walter opens the door to his apartment, carrying a grocery bag. as he flips on the lights, a metal object is thrown across the room. he catches it with one hand. it's a can of beer. a man laughs.}
<C>__{carlos }
<D>__{you still think fast.}
<A>__{carlos sits at the table with a six pack. walter sets the bag on the table and pops open the can.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{don't need to think fast to handle beer.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{ook some talking to convince your super i was a relative.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i told her all my relatives are good looking.}
<A>__{carlos laughs.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{jesus christ, man, it's good to see you!}
<A>__{carlos stands and they awkwardly embrace.}
<C>__{carlos }
<D>__{you look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{seems like the whole world's gotten younger.}
<A>__{there is silence. carlos sits back down at the table and opens another beer. walter starts unpacking the groceries.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{you doing okay?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{got a job at old frank's place. his son runs it now.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{yeah, you still with northland?}
<C>__{carlos}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{foreman now.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{no shit.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{five years.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{beautiful. how's business?}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{booming. lots of building going on. we can't keep up with all the work. in fact, i just hired a few new guys...}
<A>__{glancing at walter, he realizes his blunder.}
<C>__{carlos }
<D>__{just until we catch up.}
<A>__{there is a brief silence as both men drink. carlos looks at walter.}
<C>__{carlos }
<D>__{i will never forget you got me started there.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i just recommended you. you still had to prove yourself.}
<A>__{carlos gets up and walks over to the window. he gazes outside.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{hey, is that a school?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{k through sixth.}
<A>__{carlos glances at walter, then back outside.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{living across the street from a grade school. jesus.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{something wrong with that?}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{i was just thinking of... the noise.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i like the noise.}
<A>__{walter walks over to the window.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{one hundred and twenty feet.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{law says i can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. i figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. make a bet?}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{no way, man, you'd rob me blind!}
<A>__{the two men laugh, but the laughter quickly fades.}
<C>__{carlos }
<D>__{but maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(heated)}
<D>__{you find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and i will happily move out of this crap neighborhood.}
<A>__{carlos shrugs and tosses down the rest of his beer.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{i should go. your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{how is she?}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{annette? she's good... tense.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{when can i see her?}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{i'm working on it.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{is it because of anna?}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{i don't know. she won't talk about it.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you're the only one in the family who still talks to me.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{i remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor annette married." except her brother. you treated me with respect.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{look, you paid your dues. your slate is clean now.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{how old is anna?}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{she'll be twelve next week. we're throwing a big party on saturday. wish i could ask you to come...}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{only if it's no closer than a hundred feet.}
<A>__{carlos looks away.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{sorry, bad joke.}
<A>__{they stiffly embrace. then carlos exits leaving walter alone.}
