<A>__{needy runs into the park and scans the dark horizon. her bare feet are bloody from running and her face is shiny with sweat.}

<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{chip!}
<A>__{a terrified scream in the distance. needy whips around, hikes up her skirt and starts running toward murphy pool. she reaches the fence and starts climbing it. she slips and cuts her hand on a broken link. chip screams again on the other side of the fence.}
<C>__{needy }
<D>__{i'm coming!}
<A>__{she flings herself over the top of the fence, her body slamming against the concrete pool deck. her arm snaps. it's a compound fracture, the bone thrusting through the flesh of her arm as she screams.}
