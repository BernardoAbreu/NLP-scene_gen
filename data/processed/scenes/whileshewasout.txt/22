<A>__{the road spits her out in front of the mall entrance where revellers and shoppers are entering and exiting. della follows several cars down the first long row of parked cars. the asphalt is wet from the recent rainfall. puddles gather in its dents and hollows. she passes car after densely parked car. there isn't a space in sight. she reaches the end of the row and indicates left, turns down the next row, ploughs through a rain puddle which splashes up onto a mother who's walking her little girl and boy back to their car. the woman shouts at della.}

<D>__{watch where you're going!}
<A>__{della rolls down her window.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{sorry!}
<A>__{the mother's weighed down with shopping bags. she glares at della and drags her kids across the aisle in front of her. della sighs, drives down the second aisle. an escape midway down the row blocks traffic. it's waiting for a subaru to pull out so it can take the spot.}
