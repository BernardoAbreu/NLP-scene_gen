<C>__{winters}
<D>__{get up. i wanta talk to you.}
<A>__{joe looks resentful but makes an effort and sits up.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{don't sit up. stand up. if you can.}
<A>__{joe gets unsteadily to his feet. he feels sick. winters reaches out to shake hands. joe does not reciprocate. hides his right hand behind his body.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{what's the matter, joe? you won't shake hands with me.}
<P>__{(joe is silent)}
<D>__{you don't want me to see your hand, do you?}
<P>__{(more silence)}
<D>__{so i guess what i heard was true, huh? you been poundin' the walls with your passin' hand, right?}
<P>__{(silence)}
<D>__{i tell you what, joe, you want to hit somethin', hit me.}
<A>__{joe doesn't move.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{i said hit me. i'm the one who put you in here. don't hit the damn wall. it ain't the wall's fault. hit me! go on, hit me right now!}
<A>__{joe is angry but he doesn't want to do anything about it.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{who else you wanta hit, huh? you're daddy maybe? cause he's a no show prick? well, i'm a daddy, too, and not a very good one at that. so just hit me instead! i will take your daddy's beatin' for him. go on, you want to. hit me, damnit!}
<A>__{joe shakes his head.}
<C>__{winters}
<P>__{(pushes joe in the chest)}
<D>__{hit me! i'm not gonna leave you alone until you hit me.}
<P>__{(shakes joe by shoulders)}
<D>__{the guys'll thank you. they've always wanted to do it. so do it now, damnit! do it!}
<A>__{joe sinks to his knees. winters stares down at him, then kneels also, his own anger and frustration draining away.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{o.k., joe, it's o.k. i guess i need it more than you do.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you gotta quit beatin' up on yourself. let me see that hand.}
<A>__{joe reveals his hand. it's barked and cut, but not badly swollen.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{it's o.k.}
<P>__{(playfully)}
<D>__{you can still throw with it, you fuckin' mook.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{look, the nurses say this is the toughest time for you right now. i thought i'd stick around a little, case you wanta play some cards, pick a fight with the wall again, whatever...}
