<L>__{exterior nightmare springwood main street night}
<A>__{jacob is standing motionless in the middle of the road. he stares down into the darkness, a wooden expression on his face. karen and scott are running up behind him.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{jacob! thank god!}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{so this is the place, huh?}
<A>__{jacob's eyes are steady. he hasn't yet acknowledged the other's presence. he eyes are fixed on the gloominess in front of him. a look of vengeance beginning to grow as our shot moves in on him.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i'm home.}
<A>__{karen and scott are next to him now. they stand silently with jacob for a few seconds. then:}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what now?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{scott, are you with us?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{a deal's a deal.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{then we wait.}
<A>__{and not for long. flash! in three bursts the dream police appear directly across from the teenagers. scott and karen jump back. jacob hold his ground.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{whoa!}
<A>__{the threesomes stand face to face in two parallel rows.}
<C>__{scott }
<D>__{nice outfits.}
<C>__{power cop}
<D>__{is this all?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{all that's left.}
<C>__{sound cop}
<D>__{it'll have to do.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{we can always come back later. like when it's daytime.}
<C>__{power cop}
<D>__{it's always night here.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what's the plan?}
<C>__{blade cop}
<D>__{we need you to draw him out.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{terrific. we're supposed to be bait.}
<C>__{sound cop}
<D>__{essentially.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{then let's do it.}
<A>__{kaboooooooom! a huge brick wall, ten feet high and spreading out across the street and through the houses, blasts up from the asphalt. right between the police and the kids.}
<B>__{on the dream police side}
<A>__{the three cops crouch into battle positions. on the teenager's side the three of them have hardly any time to react before three perfectly round holes open up underneath each of them. and scott, jacob and karen fall into darkness.}
<B>__{on the dream police side}
<A>__{sound cop stands up and his body begins to vibrate. a new noise emits from his mouth: a high pitched squeal. and like the walls of jericho, the bricks in front of them fall apart and tumble to the ground. dust settles and the police walk over the rubble to the other side. the kids are gone.}
<C>__{blade cop}
<D>__{fan out.}
<A>__{the dream police break formation and scatter.}
