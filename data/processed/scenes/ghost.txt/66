<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{ah ah, baby. that does it. i don't talk to anybody who takes the lord's name in vain.}
<A>__{she stands up, as if to leave. molly watches with growing discomfort as oda mae seems to be talking to herself.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{relax, oda mae.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{you relax. you're the dead one. you want my help, then you apologize. nobody talks to me like that, understand?}

<D>__{i don't believe i'm watching this.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{damn it. all right. i apologize.}
<A>__{oda mae stops, pauses a moment, and walks back to the couch. sam, relieved, paces back and forth. oda mae's eyes follow his voice as molly watches her curiously.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{please, oda mae, i need you to tell molly what i'm saying. you gotta tell her word for word.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{monsieur has a message for you.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{molly, you're in danger.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{you can't tell her like that. and would you stop movin' all over the place? you're makin' me sick.}
<A>__{molly looks concerned. sam leans into oda mae.}

<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{he says he knows the man who killed him, willie lopez. he's puerto rican.}
<A>__{molly grows pale as she listens. her forehead tightens.}
<C>__{sam}

<D>__{write it down.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you do it!}
<C>__{oda mae}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{molly, he's got my wallet and my key. he was in here.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{he's got his wallet and key. he was in here.}

<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{he says he was set up, that he was murdered. he wants you to go to the police.}
<A>__{molly stands up, afraid. oda mae stands up, too.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i don't want nothin' to do with this.}
<A>__{oda mae heads for the door as molly watches in a daze.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{where you going?}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{don't follow me! i've done all i'm gonna do.}
