<D>__{long speechs are antithetical to the nature of cinema. the greeks called it stykomythia the rapid exchange of ideas. a long speech in a script, say a page long, requires that the camera hold on the actor's face for a minute. look at the second hand on your watch as it makes one complete rotation around the clock face and you'll get an idea of how intolerable that would be for an audience. the ontology of the screen is that it's always now and it's always action and it's always vivid. life is rarely vivid. and that's an important pointerior we are not recreating life on the screen. writers are not tape recorders. have you ever eavesdropped on people talking in a coffee shop? then you know how dull and tedious real conversation is. real people are not interesting. there's not a person in this world and i include myself in this who would be interesting enough to take as is and put in a movie as a character.}
