<L>__{ext van houten's house same}
<A>__{gus and hazel come out of the house, practically shaking. as they get to the street, van houten has one more thing to say.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{have you ever stopped to ask why you care so much about your silly questions?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{go fuck yourself.}
<A>__{van houten doesn't have a response to that. he just shuts the door. and when he does, that's when hazel gets emotional.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{hey. it's ok. it's ok...}
<P>__{(beat, an idea)}
<D>__{i will write you a sequel.}
<P>__{(she cries harder)}
<D>__{i will. better than any shit that drunk could write. with blood and guts and sacrifice. you'll love it.}
<A>__{hazel nods, then wipes away tears. she fakes a smile and gus gives her a hug. afterwards:}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i spent your wish on that asshole.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{you did not spend it on him. you spent it on us.}
<A>__{they embrace once more.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i wanted...}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i know... i know. apparently the world is not a wish granting factory.}
<A>__{this gets a real smile from hazel. that's when lidewij comes outside. clearly she's been crying too.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{i'm so sorry. circumstance has made him cruel. i thought meeting you would help him, if he would see that his work has shaped real lives, but... i'm very sorry.}
<A>__{hazel says nothing. gus holds her in a very protective way.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{perhaps we can do some sightseeing. have you seen the anne frank house?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i'm not going anywhere with that monster.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{he is not invited.}
