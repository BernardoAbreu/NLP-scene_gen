<L>__{interior hospital room continuous}
<A>__{a mass of mummy like bandages with only small openings around the mouth and one eye. the arms and hands are also wrapped in heavy dressing. no movement but for the rise and fall of the patient's chest. berthold cannot look. holding back her anguish, nina bravely turns to the doctor. "well?"}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{he's been constant with fever but he refuses any pain killers. the right hand has been amputated above the wrist. he's lost the fourth and fifth fingers on the left. we... couldn't save the left eye.}
<A>__{berthold covers his face. nina is a rock.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{his ring.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i don't }
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{he had a ring on his right hand. where is it?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i'm sorry... his hand was amputated in the field... i'm afraid }
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{as in: "that will be all." the doctor leaves. nina sits beside her husband. she shows him a photo of four beautiful children three boys and a girl. stauffenberg tries to speak but can't. his eye begins to tear. nina removes a ring from her finger, placing it on a chain with a cross she takes from around her neck. it is identical to the ring stauffenberg wore in africa. close on: the engraving inside the band finis initium [end beginning]. nina places the ring and chain on her husband's chest, her hand lingering. she cannot hold the tears back any longer. she stands and turns away, not wanting her husband to see. berthold takes her place. stauffenberg struggles to speak. berthold puts an ear to the hole where stauffenberg's mouth is making out his question, even if we can't. berthold debates answering, then:}
<C>__{berthold}
<D>__{we've lost north africa.}
<A>__{close on: that one eye staring at us closes.}
