<A>__{walter looks at the hawk still circling above and hollers }
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{how about that!?}
<A>__{slowly the sound of children fades in and a red ball bounces to walter's feet. he looks in the direction the ball came from. nothing is there. walter looks back down at his feet. the ball is gone. the sound of children fades back away and is replaced by a rhythmic squeak. walter looks towards the playground where an empty swing sways back and forth in the wind, the chain squeaking in its hinges. the hawk's cry pierces the silence. walter looks up to see the hawk being chased by two smaller birds.}
