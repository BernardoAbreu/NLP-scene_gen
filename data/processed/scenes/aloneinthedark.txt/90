<A>__{fischer and carnby stand in front of an open armory cabinet. sleek 713 assault rifles are lined up on a rack beside them. they stand on either side of a counter. a large monitor is on the wall behind them.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{i'm not much for coincidences. these organisms must be connected to those things from the museum.}
<C>__{fischer}
<D>__{we call them xenomorphs.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{catchy. when did they first appear?}
<A>__{with a remote control, fischer clicks through images on the monitor as he talks. he brings up a series of anatomical schematics of the xenomorph creatures.}
<C>__{fischer}
<D>__{two years ago. they've been 713's top priority ever since. but it's been almost exclusively in rural areas. this kind of urban infiltration is unprecedented.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{have you isolated any weaknesses?}
<A>__{fischer brings up an image of the periodic table.}
<C>__{fischer}
<D>__{most metals pass right through them. so normal bullets and blades are useless. but they're vulnerable to elements 76 to 79. osmium, iridium, platinum, and gold. negates their ability to disrupt electricity.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{if they disrupt electricity, why did my flashlight still work?}
<C>__{fischer}
<D>__{the closer the current to its power source, the less disruption.}
<A>__{fischer takes a hand held para meter scanning device off a rack. it is a sleek, updated version of carnby's para meter, similar to the agents' rifle mounted scanners.}
<C>__{fischer }
<D>__{this is calibrated to track their disruption field. it won't help you see them, but you'll know when they're nearby.}
<A>__{fischer brings up a computer simulations of the creatures' disruption field, displaying how it works.}
<C>__{fischer }
<D>__{they live almost exclusively in darkness. sunlight's lethal in large doses. but only certain light frequencies hurt them.}
<A>__{fischer takes a rifle off the rack and lays it down on the counter in front of them. off another rack, fischer picks up a lamp. he flips it on and off, shining the bright blue beam around. fischer snaps the lamp into place at the top of the rifle.}
<C>__{ischer }
<D>__{these lamps are set to an effective frequency.}
<A>__{fischer takes out several magazines of ammo out of the cabinet. he discharges a bullet. it glows yellow in his hand.}
<C>__{fischer }
<D>__{but for maximum damage, we use bullets coated in a photon accelerated luminescent resin. cuts right through them.}
<A>__{fischer hands the rifle and a magazine to carnby. carnby loads the magazine and checks the rifle like a pro.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{i'm going to need a lot of those.}
