<A>__{a fork digs into a large strawberry. pull back as we follow the strawberry into sharon's mouth. dulaney sits across from sharon. his eyes are on the strawberries. his mind is someplace else and it isn't hard to guess where.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{ he said it might be too expensive to add another room. he suggested we might convert the garage into a guest room. he's going to check with the contractor and let me know. i will let you know how much and we can decide. alright?}
<A>__{dulaney looks up slowly. it is not so much that he has heard the question it is more that he is aware that sharon has stopped talking. a beat. sharon isn't sure he has heard her.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{is that alright, frank?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{yeah fine. excuse me. i will be right back.}
<A>__{he stands and leaves the table.}
