<A>__{we see sam and lucy crammed into the booth, wearing birthday hats, taking her first birthday picture. we see the photo strip as it comes out of the slot. sam's shoulder with lucy's ear lucy's nose with sam's elbow, their faces never made it into the picture.}

<A>__{sam turns and we see lucy attached to him in a handmade snugly, crocheted by annie. she faces outward, all hands, all 16 months of her; too big for the snugly. she grabs a croissant from a customer. george looks confused. then makes a swipe for a customer's coffee, knocking it to the ground. it splatters all over an anorexic, on her fourth double latte woman in a designer exercise outfit. she begins shrieking. george looks at sam, this can't go on.}
