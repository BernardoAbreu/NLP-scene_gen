<L>__{interior day morgue}
<A>__{the refrigerated compartment bays, containing the corpses, are aligned along the basement walls. a young doctor escorts ben and amy down the corridors of the morgue. as he is walking, the doctor flips through the register, in search of a name.}
<C>__{young doctor}
<D>__{gary lewis... gary lewis... oh, there he is, 58b... he slashed his throat...}
<C>__{amy}
<P>__{(to ben)}
<D>__{there you go... there's your answer. your man committed suicide.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you know a lot of people who cut their own throats?}
<C>__{young doctor}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{well, all i know is that the cops are still investigating this one. that's why we still have the body. people can be very creative when it comes to suicide. i'm sure it's not the craziest thing you've seen.}
<A>__{the young doctor stops in front of the number 58b. he opens the door to the refrigerated compartment bay and pulls out the tray carrying the corpse, wrapped in a white sheet }
<C>__{young doctor }
<D>__{gary lewis...}
<A>__{he lifts the sheet, revealing gary lewis' upper body gary's eyes are rolled upwards and his throat is wide open. his skin has become translucent, almost purple. his contorted corpse is frozen in a deadly expression of profound suffering... his flesh has started to decompose and putrefy. ben stares at the body, in search of a hint, a clue, any useful information... amy becomes impatient.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i've got to get back to work, ben. they're waiting for me upstairs.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{how... what did he slit his throat with?}
<A>__{the doctor checks the report.}
<C>__{young doctor}
<D>__{with... with a piece of mirror.}
<A>__{ben looks up.}
<C>__{young doctor }
<D>__{...he must have smashed it into pieces to have something to slash it with...}
<A>__{the doctor, has a smirk on his face }
<C>__{young doctor }
<D>__{...seven years of bad luck.}
<A>__{suddenly, reflected in the stainless steel door of the compartment bay, ben sees gary's face turn slowly towards him. gary stares directly at him. with a voice from beyond, he delivers a message to ben }
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{...esssekerrr...}
<A>__{ben jumps out of his skin and backs away, terrified. neither amy nor the doctor saw anything, of course. they gaze at him with a puzzled look }
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{are you ok, ben? what's going on?}
<A>__{ben looks at the corpse and its reflection again gary is frozen in the same contorted position, as if nothing ever happened.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(coming to his senses)}
<D>__{i need to see his files...}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{ben raises his voice.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i need to see his files!}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{come on, ben, what is it you're after? i am not supposed to show you any file... you're not even allowed to be here. i could get fired for this.}
<A>__{the doctor senses that the conversation is taking on a more personal turn.}
<C>__{young doctor}
<D>__{well, i will be off. amy, you know where to find me if you need me.}
<A>__{amy is left alone with ben.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what is happening to you? what is all this supposed to mean? what is going on, ben?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i won't leave until i see that file.}
