<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{seven minutes to twelve...}
<A>__{they nod. shoulder to shoulder, they move down the tunnel, faster and faster. irene trails them closely. watson slides his sword stick into a loop on his belt. it's there when he needs it, out of the way otherwise. they draw their guns. they burst into the area, completely surprising the three thugs. watson pistol whips the nearest. holmes front kicks the nexterior the third thug looks down the barrels of both their guns before he has a chance to fight or flee.}

<D>__{over there.}
<A>__{sullen, but without much resistance, they move away (two dragging the pistol whipped one, who is out). watson turns so that he can watch the action at the device which puts his back to another tunnel. holmes joins irene at the device. she grips her knife, looking for a way to detach the cylinder from the cradle (where electric coils and circuits pulse).}

<A>__{she reaches out with her knife and... zap! her blade hits a coil, sparks flashing. electrocuted, she drops the knife, which falls into the cradle, surrounded by humming, sparking coils. irene recoils, sees something past holmes rack past holmes to watson where dredger looms out of the dark behind him, both hands held high to grab the guns and smash watson. before irene can alert him, watson's wrists are crushed from behind. dredger jerks watson's arms sideways, sending both guns spinning away holmes's gun splashes into the sewer. dredger spins watson around, head butts him with a teeth rattling blow, flings watson away like a discarded paper cup. now unguarded, the two conscious thugs charge holmes and irene. irene shoots one point blank with her derringer, holmes crushes the other's larynx.}
