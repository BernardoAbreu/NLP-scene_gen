<L>__{interior kphx control room day}
<A>__{abby and the control room crew watch the proceedings. cliff mans the bank of monitors.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{take marriage for instance. it's about mutual benefits, social pressure, and taxes. it's not about love and we should stop pretending it is.}
<A>__{we intercut : with georgia, larry, and mike on set.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{c'mon georgia, let him have it.}
<C>__{georgia}
<D>__{sounds to me like no one's ever loved you and you're taking it out on the female population.}
<A>__{in the control room, abby smirks.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{ooh, good one.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{well, while we're making observations, you two project this image of the perfect couple, when clearly, it's a lie.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<A>__{abby nervously gnaws on the straw from her kombucha drink.}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{cliff, let's go to commercial.}
<C>__{cliff}
<D>__{stuart told me to keep rolling, no matter what.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{what? when?}
<A>__{cliff shrugs. abby is pissed.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{this is my show.}
<C>__{cliff}
<D>__{not right now it isn't.}
<A>__{on the set, mike continues his vivisection of larry and georgia.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i mean, come on larry, i grew up watching you on tv. you used to be this cool confident cat. georgia's no dumb bunny. she knew the only way she was getting off the weekend shift was by hooking up with you. but then lo and behold, she became more popular than you and ended up with twice your salary.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{c'mon, larry. take him down.}
<A>__{she starts twisting her straw into shapes, as }
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i'm proud of my wife's success.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{bullllloney you are. you hate her success. you feel emasculated by her and that screws with your head which inevitably screws with your manhood.}
<C>__{georgia}
<D>__{what's your point, mr. alexander?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{good girl, georgia. take control.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{my point? my point is that your husband hasn't had sex with you in...i'm gonna say. . .three months?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{that's not my fault!}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i know, it's her fault!}
<C>__{georgia}
<D>__{why is it my fault?!}
<A>__{in the control room, abby looks like she's going to pass out.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{oh, dear god.}
<C>__{georgia}
<D>__{well, what am i supposed to do, give up the money, so he can get an erection?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i agree. you've economically emasculated your husband to such a point that he's afraid to desire you. sure, you can dump his ass, but honey, have you seen the eligible men in albuquerque? it's slim pickings out there for a woman in her forties. you're not going to do any better than larry. you just have to let him be a man. let him be a man, georgia!}
<C>__{mike }
<P>__{(to larry)}
<D>__{and you, frowny mcflacid, give it to her. now!}
<A>__{larry grabs georgia and kisses her hard. after a moment of resistance, she melts into his arms. the crew goes crazy. larry throws georgia over his back and hauls her off the set. abby sinks down into a chair.}
<C>__{cliff}
<D>__{and we're out.}
<A>__{he cuts to black.}
