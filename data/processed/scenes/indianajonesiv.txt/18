<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{close up: an ancient painting. the watercolor features an upright, wrinkled face sun wu kung, the stone monkey king. but the monkey is not made of stone. he appears to be half human... half monkey. his face is wise. his coal black eyes are penetrating. he wears a lion skin robe, and holds a tall, golden hooped staff. sun wu kung stands amidst a garden of luscious, ripe peace trees. he is surrounded by a heavenly glow, a bright ray of light that emanates from an opening in the clouds.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{...look familiar?}
<A>__{camera pulls back. we are inside of the museum board room. marcus holds the tattered painting before indiana, who sits at a desk, still feverishly grading the wet term papers. after he finishes each paper, indy pins it to a nearby bulletin board for drying. he glances to the painting of sun wu kung.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{"sun wu kung, the stone monkey king". big deal. that was ten years ago, marcus.}
<P>__{(going back to papers,}
<D>__{wanting to change}
<P>__{subject)}
<D>__{geez! this heller kid's got the worst grammar.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{ten years or fifty years. it will always be in your blood.}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(ignoring marcus)}
<D>__{don't believe this... he spells "repeat" with two "e's".}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{think back, indiana. remember your desire? your passion?}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(still ignores marcus)}
<D>__{kid gets an "a" on content...a "d" on form.}
<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(angry, slams his fist on the desk)}
<D>__{damn it, man! you can't bury those feelings forever!}
<A>__{indiana finally looks up from the papers. he glances at marcus, then looks at the painting. camera dollies into indiana's face. he becomes very serious. somber. his eyes are empty. memories of failure fill his head.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{two years. nearly two years of my life...looking for the remains of that monkey...a piece of his legendary golden hooped rod...or some sign of the lost city.}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{nine men perished on the journey. rest of us nearly died from starvation or one of the many horrible deseases we discovered...}
<P>__{(looks back to papers, in a near whisper)}
<D>__{we still came back empty handed.}
<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(threading the projector)}
<D>__{one mustn't give up so easily, indiana.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{give up?!?... marcus, we spent thirteen months in china!...another seven in india!...}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{but none in africa.}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(puzzled expression)}
<D>__{there was no proof...archeological or anthropological...to indicate that sun wu kung ever visited africa...}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{until now.}
<A>__{marcus turns off the room lights.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{hey... my papers...}
<A>__{marcus starts the projector. a black and white image flickers on the far wall. we see a pygmy, standing in what appears to be a grassy area. the pygmy's name is tyki. he is adorable. a little over four feet tall, his body is taut, muscular. his long black hair is shaggy, his eyes are wide and bright. almost childlike. his face is cute. impish. covered with a very inquisitive expression. tyki's energy is boundless. he cannot stop moving. standing beside tyki, is dr. clare clarke. 32 years old. a tall, strikingly beautiful woman. she is communicating with tyki in sign language.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{the woman is dr. clare clarke. the famous zoologist. she works in africa, studying animals in their natural habitat.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{very interesting, marcus. now if you'll turn the lights back on }
<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{three weeks ago, dr. clarke discovered that cute little fellow... "tyki"...a pygmy of an unusual race...unrelated to any known african tribe...}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(bored)}
<D>__{marcus. the lights.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{dr. clarke believes that tyki comes from the lost civilization of sun wu kung.}
<A>__{indiana pauses. he stands, walking closer to the flickering image. suddenly interested.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{what?... but how did miss }
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{"doctor".}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{"doctor" clake. how did she arrive at such a preposterous hypothesis?}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{the pygmy speaks in a language that has no african origins...but bears a strong resemblance to chinese.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{means nothing. the rivers of africa have been plagued by various oriental pirates and scavengers since the 16th century.}
<P>__{(turns from screen)}
<D>__{not much evidence, marcus.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{there's more. the pygmy was found wearing an ornamental peach stone around his neck...believed to come from sun wu kung's legendary garden of immortal peaches.}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{marcus, there are countless undiscovered african tribes...all with various obscure beliefs and practices...}
<P>__{(smirks)}
<D>__{one tribe may wear peach stones... another may wear banana peels...}
<A>__{indiana walks back to his papers. marcus pauses.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{there is one final bit of evidence...}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{enlighten me.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{the pygmy is over 200 years old.}
<A>__{indiana adjusts his spectacles. he stares at the black and white image. the cute pygmy appears to be in his mid twenties. he walks to the camera, staring into the lens. tyki examines the camera with}
<B>__{curiosity.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{that's impossible.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{dr. clarke has done a considerable amount of testing on the pygmy's clothing...his sandals...everything was over 200 years old.}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{he's probably wearing his great grandfather's stuff.}
<A>__{camera pans back to the projected image. tyki begins to unscrew the camera lens. the picture goes out of focus. the film runs out. marcus turns off the projector and flips on the overhead room lights. indiana gives marcus a puzzled look.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{what does all of this have to do with me?}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{dr. clarke wants to mount an expedition to find the lost city of sun wu kung. she is quite familiar with your reputation...she'd like you to come along.}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(gathering his papers)}
<D>__{no chance.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{there will be money involved... the museum is willing to fund the expedition...}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{sorry, marcus. i've burned this bridge.}
<A>__{indiana turns and begins to walk out of the room. marcus calls him.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{indiana...}
<A>__{indy turns. he waves the papers at marcus.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{marcus. please. i've got to finish these...}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you've got to finish something much more important. you crossed the threshold over a decade ago...and it's been tearing at your insides ever since.}
<P>__{(passionate)}
<D>__{my friend, if there is even one iota of truth in dr. clarke's findings... then you can lift the veil of mystery that has surrounded this chinese legend for centuries. you may uncover the secrets to a lost civilization...and possibly, to man's never ending search for immortality.}
<A>__{indiana stares at the painting of sun wu kung.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{indiana... can you afford to pass up the single most important adventure of your life?}
<A>__{indiana has no answer for marcus. indy picks up the painting. a thrilling expression slowly covers indiana's face. his eyes glimmer. filled with a long, lost excitement. the sound track music soars!}
