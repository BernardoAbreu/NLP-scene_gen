<D>__{don't you see, the island was carnivorous.}
<C>__{writer}
<D>__{carnivorous? like... a venus flytrap?}
<C>__{adult pi}
<D>__{yes, the whole island the plants, the water in those pools, the very ground itself. during the day, those pools held fresh water, but at night, some chemical process turned the water in those pools into acid acid that dissolved those fish, that sent the meerkats scurrying into the trees and richard parker running to the boat.}

<D>__{but where did the tooth come from?}
<C>__{adult pi}
<D>__{years ago, some poor fellow just like me must have found himself stranded on that island.... and like me he thought he might stay there forever. but all that the island gave him by day, it took away again by night. to think how many hours spent with only meerkats for company? how much loneliness taken on?}
<C>__{adult pi }
<D>__{all i know is that eventually he died, and the island digested him, leaving behind only his teeth. i saw how my life would end if i stayed on that island. alone and forgotten. i had to go back to the world, or die trying.}
