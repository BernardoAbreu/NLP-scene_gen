<A>__{decorated in carol brady chic. when it's not gaudy, tacky, and loud, it's blander than toast. colors like lime green and sunshine orange should be reserved for popsicles only. mrs. bruce, late 30's, enters looking exhausted. she carries a glass of wine in one hand and a book in the other, erma bombeck's the grass is always greener over the septic tank. humming "we've only just begun," mrs. bruce crouches next to her wildly ancient entertainment center complete with 8 track. she flips the first record forward on her ronco record mate. album after album flaps forward. olivia newton john, neil diamond, the osmond brothers. she stops on the carpenters and sighs at the serene cover art. just what the doctor ordered. placing the vinyl on the turntable, she clicks the dustcover closed and flicks "play." reclining in her lazyboy, she sips her wine, opens the book and awaits the mellow tones of karen carpenter. suddenly, her eardrums are hammered by machine gun guitar. caustic rock 'n' roll assaults her senses. she jumps, spilling her wine all over herself. this isn't the carpenters... it's kiss! racing to the entertainment center, she turns the volume control knob so violently, it comes off in her hand. the music is even louder now. flustered by the awful noise, she tries lifting the dustcover. it's stuck. she screams and covers her ears. this is hell. running to the rear of the huge console, she stretches to reach the plug, but can't. fingertips millimeters away. as the cacophony pounds she shakes the entire stereo with all her frantic might. screeeeeech! the needle scrapes across the vinyl with a shrill, finally coming to a stop. whew, silence! then, pop, the dustcover opens unceremoniously. shaken, she grabs the record with trembling hands and reads the label...}
