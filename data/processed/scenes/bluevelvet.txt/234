<A>__{frank gets out and presses his face against the rear window. his distorted face is hideous. he opens the back door. raymond and paul grab jeffrey and pull him out of the car. the greasy girl laughs nervously.}

<D>__{shut up. gimme your lipstick.}
<P>__{(takes gas)}
<D>__{. hey, pretty, pretty.}
<A>__{dorothy doesn't move fast enough so frank dumps her whole purse out on the front seat and grabs the lipstick and a flashlight. he puts lipstick heavy onto his lips. while raymond and paul hold jeffrey. frank kisses jeffrey all over the mouth. jeffrey tries to hit frank and pull away, but raymond and paul have a hold of him. jeffrey looks very strange with these big blotches of red lipstick on his face and mouth.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{leave him alone!! frank!!}
<A>__{frank slams the front door shut to muffle dorothy. he grabs jeffrey and presses his frightened face against the front window. then, the back window. then, he flops jeffrey up on the hood with paul's help and presses jeffrey's face against the rear window. inside the car, this show is crazy and scary. then, frank takes jeffrey over to the side of the car again.}
