<L>__{exterior sydney, australia. day.}
<A>__{christof stands with a production manager, mid thirties, on the forecourt of the sydney opera house, its sail like roofs soaring above them. framing the background, the coathanger shaped sydney harbor bridge.}
<C>__{prod. manager}
<P>__{(unable to conceal his pride)}
<D>__{happy?}
<A>__{christof gives a grudgingly complimentary nod.}
<C>__{christof}
<P>__{(staring out at the pleasure craft littering the harbor)}
<D>__{can we contain him long enough?}
<C>__{prod. manager}
<D>__{i think so.}
<A>__{christof looks skyward at the cottonwool clouds above the harbor.}
<C>__{prod. manager}
<P>__{(anticipating his next question)}
<D>__{he flies at night. thick cloud cover to disorient him. hopefully we'll knock him out with complimentary cocktails, pull the shades down during the movies. he'll never know.}
<A>__{christof gives another grudging nod of approval. the production manager is beckoned by a group of construction workers who are putting the finishing touches to a corner of the opera house. chloe drifts to christof's side, a watchman tv in her hand.}
<C>__{chloe}
<P>__{(referring to the surrounding scene)}
<D>__{why go to all the trouble?}
<A>__{christof glances at the tv screen in her hand, showing truman sitting in his office gazing at his composite picture of sylvia.}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{he believes she has the answer.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{why not just tell him she's dead?}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{it's too late for that. that won't satisfy him. he's going to have to find out for himself. see it with his own eyes. right now he needs something genuine.}
<P>__{(rueful, all too aware of the contradiction)}
<D>__{even if we have to fake it.}
