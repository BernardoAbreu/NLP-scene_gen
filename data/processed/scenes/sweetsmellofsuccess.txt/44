<D>__{sure, i will wait...}
<A>__{while doing so, he glances back with disinterest at evans and temple. the comedian and the agent exchange looks. evans is uneasy; he comes up the steps into the corridor to address sidney with a deflated manner.}

<D>__{j.j...sidney!...how are you, sweetheart?}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{yeah...}
<P>__{(then seriously)}
<D>__{listen, i know it's late, j.j., but is it too late to add something important to the column?}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{no, not a relative, but important...}
<A>__{resume gloria in interior of sidney's apartment shaking her head, gloria places the phone down on the desk, looks at it as it chatters away. she considers returning to her typing, but, worried, picks the phone up again. sidney's chattering voice is barely audible: "you know herbie temple, the comic...? what about him? he's at the palace and he's great. that's what about him. and you'd do me a big bunny basket of a favor if you would say it in tomorrow's column.}

<P>__{(to phone, continuing)}
<D>__{if there's a funnier man in the world than herbie temple at the palace...uh...pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing. no, make that 'screaming'.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{it's sweet of you, j.j., thanks. probably see you at twenty one tonight. no, for supper, late. right. 'bye...}

<D>__{speak to this lad, al, ... to mr. falco.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{see me in my office.}
<A>__{he turns and walks away down the corridor. as he vanishes, temple starts after him.}
<B>__{corridor}
<A>__{sidney walks off in the direction of the exit (not so fast that he can't be overtaken). temple hurries into the corridor and comes after him. evans also follows, though not so eagerly.}
<C>__{temple}
<D>__{wait a minute.}
<P>__{(turning back to encourage evans)}
<D>__{speak to him, al.}
<P>__{(to sidney, apologetically)}

<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(coolly, looking toward evans)}
<D>__{i don't like a guy that's quick with the hands.}
<P>__{(to temple)}
<D>__{temple, you've been three passes behind for twenty years. this could start you off big t.v. and anywhere.}
<A>__{evans, not as wholly convinced as the comedian, comes up to join them. temple looks at the agent.}
<C>__{temple}
<D>__{and it would cost a pretty penny, huh?}

<P>__{(to evans)}
<D>__{you tell him, i stutter!}
<C>__{evans}
<P>__{(shrewdly)}
<D>__{uh...why don't we wait till tomorrow?}
<A>__{sidney, shrugging, makes a negligent exit.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(as he goes)}
<D>__{wait as long as you like you know where my office is.}
<A>__{they look after him. evans face is cold and suspecting, but temple's face contains fresh warmth.}
