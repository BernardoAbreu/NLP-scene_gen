<T>__{cut :}
<A>__{across his palm.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{my hand... something stuck it.}
<A>__{sheryl quickly examines the cut. mike quickly becomes flustered, woozy. he turns away from the wound.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{it's okay. it's not too deep. let me get the first aid kit.}
<A>__{sheryl rummages through her bag. mike, in more psychological discomfort than physical, looks away wincing. sheryl returns, wipes the blood away best she can. she applies some peroxide...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{fuck. that stung.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{gotta clean the wound, baby.}
<A>__{obscured pov through trees from a distance... a sickle blade enters frame, pulls a branch aside. sheryl attends to mike's wound. the pov narrows... solely on sheryl. timber falls, trail #1 mike looks at sheryl, a twinge of embarrassment in his eyes.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you know me and blood... we don't do so well.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{i know.}
<P>__{(she finishes)}
<D>__{all done.}
<A>__{off screen: crunch of something stepping on a thicket. sheryl glances toward the sound. mike admires the dressing of the wound.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{not bad, nightingale. not bad at all.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{did you hear something?}
<A>__{mike follows her eye line. there's a softer crunch.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{it's probably the deer.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{the deer went in the other direction.}
<A>__{mike's demeanor suddenly becomes cold, creepy.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{maybe it's someone, or something, stalking us.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{quit it.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{something inhuman watching our every move.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{i said, knock it off.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{something coming for you, sheryl.}
<A>__{sheryl straps on her backpack.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{just when i think there's hope for you.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{you're an asshole.}
<A>__{sheryl walks away.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{this is a joke. you're not really mad, are you? sheryl...?}
<A>__{she turns the corner and is out of sight.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i'm sorry!}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{unbelievable.}
<A>__{mike's in disbelief. he grabs his backpack, heads after her.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{sheryl!}
<A>__{he turns the corner, looks up, but doesn't see her. the path winds like a snake.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{sheryl, wait up!}
<A>__{mike moves up the winding path. he stops, eyes searching. something's wrong. the path opens up. mike can now see a hundred yards ahead, but... no sign of sheryl.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(calls out)}
<D>__{sheryl?! this isn't funny.}
<A>__{silence. two birds scream and fly from their perch overhead. mike eyes the birds, then takes off. mike's heart rate increases. he moves quickly up the path, a steep incline. he brushes past a bush and stops. lying just off the path... sheryl's blue hiker's towel. he picks it up.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{sheryl?!}
<A>__{no reply. his heart now pounding. mike moving faster. up ahead, he stops again, finds... sheryl's red bandana.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{sheryl!}
<A>__{silence. mike picks up the bandana. he's flying. he cuts through some tiny evergreens, off the path...}
