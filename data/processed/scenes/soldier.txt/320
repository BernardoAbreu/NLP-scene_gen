<P>__{(suddenly, urgently)}
<D>__{shhhhhhh!}
<A>__{sandra is reacting to vague movement in the shadows beyond the door...and sounds. she puts her hand over the mouth of a whimpering child, hushes another. a timber falls outside the door and sandra sees a shadowy shape enter the meeting room, looming in the darkness. frightened children hold their breath, peer out fearfully. crack! smash! the huge shape hurls aside the debris in his way, switches on a flashlight, probes the darkness. the light wipes the damaged room. suddenly, sandra gasps.}
