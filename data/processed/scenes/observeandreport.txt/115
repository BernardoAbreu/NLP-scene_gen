<L>__{interior mall manager's office day}
<A>__{mark sits across the desk from ronnie and charles.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{how fucking stupid do you have to be?! i mean dennis. what the fuck, ronnie? how could you not have known it was dennis? then, how the fuck could you be so stupid as to let him get away. observe and report. those are the only two things you have to do and you can't do those worth a shit.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{can i speak now?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{just start talking, ronnie!}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{it seems only natural that 'some people' would want to blame me and truth be told i do put a lot of that blame on myself. but some people might say that the cops are to blame for not catching them. some people might say that the reason this happened was the undeniable fact that i was under equipped and quite frankly, lacking a sufficient firearm. but not me. i carry this loss alone deep inside my heart.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{good. because you're fired.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(playful)}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm serious, ronnie. i've always liked you, but there's just no excuse for this. somebody is going down and i will be damned if it's going to be me. now, don't make a big thing out of this. just pack your shit and get out by the end of the day.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{wait a minute. i thought i could trust you, mark, and now you're telling me that you're going to be the one to put the knife in my back. fair weather friend you are.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm not your friend, i'm your boss.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you think you're so smart, mark. you don't know everything. if you're firing me, then you can say goodbye to your entire security staff. because there is no fucking way my team is going to work here if you fire me. isn't that right, charles?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{ronnie, i got to talk to you about this. mark asked me down here to escort you out.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{and you told him to fuck off, right? charles? right?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{what the fuck do you want from me, ronnie?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{this isn't happening! everybody is fucking me over?! i hate you all.}
<A>__{charles stands up.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{i'm sorry, ronnie, but it's time to go.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{wait a minute. i will work for free, mark.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no, ronnie.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i will pay you.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i love you.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{ronnie, jesus have a little self respect.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you don't love me, mark?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{ronnie, it's over.}
<A>__{ronnie takes a deep breath. he stands up to leave. ronnie starts to walk out, but stops.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{hey, charles. mark asked you down here in case i got out of hand? well, get ready to earn your money.}
<A>__{ronnie cracks. he grabs a calendar and throws it on the ground in a violent baby like outburst.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{stop him!}
<A>__{charles tries to grab ronnie, but ronnie pushes him off. ronnie knocks the framed pictures off of the wall. he then opens the door and slams it into the wall over and over again. that does nothing. ronnie tries to rip the cushion on the chair. he looks ridiculous.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{alright, ronnie, that's enough.}
<A>__{ronnie stops and begins to cry. then he runs out of the office in tears.}
