<A>__{the cabin is seen from the outside. twilight has come.}
<L>__{25 interior twilight m.r.}
<A>__{cheryl sits alone in the living room near the window. she is drawing sketches of the old clock. as she works, the ticking stops unexpectedly. cheryl puts down her pencil and looks up to the clock. it stands silently in the cor ner with its hands frozen in position. there is a rust ling from the woods. cheryl looks out the window but can see only the trees. something is moving outside, yet re mains hidden within the forest. a gust of wind fills the room. cheryl glances down at her hand. it turns a pale white and begins to shake and jerk about uncontrollably. she stares on incredulously as her hand, guided by some unseen force picks up the pencil and begins to sketch a figure upon her pad. the wind gales through the open window but dies down slowly as her hand completes the drawing. whatever was at the edge of the woods has now retreated further into them. her hand loses the pale cast and is now under control once more. cheryl picks up her pad of paper. the likeness of a book with some form of ancient writing on its cover has been sketched. she looks to the woods which are now silent. a snapping of wood is heard from the cellar. cheryl quickly turns to the trap door still nailed shut in the floor. pos sibly just a mouse, but she fixes her gaze upon it. another sound, almost like faint breathing comes from the cellar.}
