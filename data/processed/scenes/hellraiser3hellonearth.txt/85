<L>__{interior main room, joey's apt. night}
<A>__{.. she's back in her room. alone. window intact. normal view. joey stares around, her face a mix of sadness and relief. the mood now is very down, post cataclysmic, post adventure. joey takes a deep slow breath and crosses the room toward the kitchen door. she crosses the floor without glancing down at it. why should she? everything's over. but we notice, even if she doesn't, that the box is no longer there. but we hardly have time to register this before ... joey opens the kitchen door.}
<C>__{joey}
<P>__{(screams!!!!)}
<A>__{pinhead is framed in the doorway. behind him, instead of her kitchen, is the black space of hell like the torture rooms in hellraiser and hellbound, it is full of shadowy pillars and chains.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{oh, no kiss of welcome after 70 years?}
<A>__{joey backs away, shaking her head in shocked denial. pinhead moves forward, very leisurely.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{this will be so good, joey. you loved him, didn't you? i can feel him inside, weeping for you. he can watch through the centuries as we discover the things that make you whimper.}
<A>__{joey's mood breaks and she turns and rushes for her front door. she reaches it, throws it open ... and screams. jp monroe is in the doorway but he's only just recognizable. he's now a cenobite blue skinned, scarred, mutilated, and decorated with metal and leather.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{you never met, did you? this was jp monroe.}
<C>__{jp cenobite}
<D>__{have you seen what they did to me? have you seen what they did? you interfering little whore!}
<A>__{the jp cenobite moves into the room. joey, now near hysteria, rushes across the room again to the one remaining door her bedroom. she throws that one open ... and terri, the new female cenobite, walks out at her. she has the open box in her hand and several cigarette protruding from different holes in her cheek and face.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{terri? oh no! no!! terri!!}
<C>__{terri cenobite}
<D>__{oh, go on. have one. fuck it. you think you're going to live forever?}
<A>__{pinhead and jp are advancing across the room toward joey and terri. joey only has seconds to act ...}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{wanna light, you bitch?!}
<A>__{joey pulls her father's zippo from her pocket and sparks it up as she swings it through the air close to terri's face. a huge flame shoots out of the zippo (as in the earlier scene) and scours across terri's face. terri howls in terror, throws her hands to her face ... and the box flies from her hands. joey catches it, spins it, closes it! an arc of blue light zaps across to terri and she's gone ... still in one movement, swinging on her heels, joey twists the box again ... and another arc of light zaps jp away ... joey completes her turn. she's facing pinhead. she holds the box before her like a weapon ... and she's got the monster in her sights ...}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{his hands are raised palms out. he's stopped advancing. joey holds the box ready, breathing heavy, waiting ...}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{you can send me back. but why? i can help you, joey. i can give you what you want.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{you'll never know what i want ...}
<A>__{(despite what she's said, we see joey's face register every word of pinhead's reply, every nuance, every promise ... )}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{respect. power. you and i can put your name on the world's lips, your face on it's screens ...}
<A>__{camera tracks closer to the box in joey's hands as pinhead speaks. closer and closer until it's side fills the screen. cross fade}
