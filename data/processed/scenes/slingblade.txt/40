<L>__{interior hamburger establishment day}
<A>__{vaughan is carrying a tray of food as karl follows him to a table and they sit and immediately start to eat. after a few bites, vaughan starts to speak in an official manner.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{okay, karl, the reason i brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind.}
<P>__{(pauses for a response,}
<D>__{instead karl eats french fries and stares at the}
<P>__{table)}
<D>__{i guess i will put it right out on the table. where do i start. linda and frank are very important to me. they're like family. my own family was never like family. they're horrible people. as a matter of fact i prayed every night for years that my father would die. i finally realized through a lot of therapy that i was wasting my energy on hating him. now i just don't care.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you see, you and i are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. i mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. we're different. people see us as being different anyway. you're well you have your affliction or whatever and i, well mine's not as easy to see. i'm just going to say it. i'm gay.}
<P>__{(watts)}
<D>__{does that surprise you?}
<P>__{(watts)}
<D>__{that i'm gay. you know what being gay is, don't you?}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{i reckon not.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{homosexual. i like men. sexually.}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{well that's a very offensive way to put it. you shouldn't say that. you were taught that, weren't you?}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{i've heard it said that way.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. i've wanted to leave many times, but my love for linda and frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. anyway, i'm rambling. if you're going to live in the wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. doyle is a monster. not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. a dangerous person. i've told linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. maybe even kill one of them. i see it in his eyes. i'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. doyle will make your life hell. you're a perfect target. when i first saw you i was afraid of you. not really afraid, i guess, just taken aback. but also, i felt a real sensitive feeling from you. and for some reason, frank has adopted you. much like a stray animal. i'm sorry, i didn't mean it like that. in a good way. anyway, i just want you to know what you're in for. i have a good feeling about you. you're good for frank. maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. i'm sorry, i didn't mean it in a bad way.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{there's one more thing. it's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something terrible. but what i see before me is a gentle, simple man. all i want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around linda and frank. you know. you would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{i wouldn't never hurt them.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{that's what i thought. i hope i haven't offended you in any way. you seem like a thinker. you seem to always be in deep thought. tell me something. what are you thinking right now?}
<A>__{karl looks up and stares for a moment.}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{i was thinkin' i could use me another helpin' of these potaters.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{oh. how about before that?}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{before that i was thinkin' it'd be good if i could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry.}
