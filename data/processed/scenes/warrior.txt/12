<L>__{interior colt's pittsburgh fight club day}
<A>__{fenroy sits at the front desk and looks at his computer. watches "mma live" and another feature on the big upcoming sparta tournament. tommy, wearing a wife beater and old gray sweats, works a bag and eyeballs an entourage that surrounds a ring. inside, a heavily muscled fighter with a mohawk, mad dog grimes (30s), is putting a beating on his sparring partner. the obsequious nature of the entourage makes it clear that mad dog is somebody important. in the ring, the sparring partner takes a vicious spinning back fist to the chin, goes down in a heap, and doesn't get up. colt boyd (40s), clearly in charge, throws up his hands as mad dog laughs.}

<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{sure, no problem.}
<C>__{colt boyd}
<D>__{come on in.}
<A>__{colt boyd waves tommy into the ring. mad dog's entourage starts whispering amongst themselves. snickering at what lays in wait for tommy as the fallen sparring partner is helped out of the ring. a trainer tapes tommy's hands and gives him some mma gloves. he slips them on, then at the sound of a buzzer he starts moving toward mad dog, who smirks at tommy's aggression and then starts circling him. tommy nails him with a front kick to the chest. grimes staggers back and shakes it off.}
<C>__{mad dog}
<D>__{gonna be a hero? alright.}
<A>__{he crouches down, gets serious. he throws a right. blocked. a leg kick. blocked. tommy snaps his head with a jab. then he does it again. and again. then he decks him with a hard right, sending mad dog to the canvas to the shock of his entourage and colt boyd. fenroy looks up from his post and walks over to the ring. within moments everyone in the gym stops what they're doing and watches as tommy grabs the back of mad dog's head, hauls it down, and launches knee after knee into his face. tommy starts throwing mad dog around like a rag doll, striking him with vicious punches and kicks, as fenroy pulls out his cell phone and starts filming the action. as colt boyd screams at mad dog to cover up, tommy shoves him against the ropes and blasts away. tommy continues to pound. it's a full fledged beating going on in there. finally, he crushes mad dog with a vicious left hook and sends him sprawling through the ropes, unconscious. silence in the gym. what the hell just happened here? the entourage rushes to mad dog's aid, but he's out cold. colt boyd looks on in disbelief as tommy walks across the ring and approaches him.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{you owe me two hundred bucks.}
