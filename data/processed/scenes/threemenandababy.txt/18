<L>__{interior safeway day}
<A>__{now peter is surrounded by three women arguing: the store clerk standing with her arms crossed and haughtily looking down on everyone; an efficient, practical sort of young woman (woman #1); and another thin, pale woman whose baby is lying in a baby carrier in her shopping cart and who seems very nervous (woman #2).}
<D>__{woman #1 does she have any teeth yet or not? that would give us a clue as to how old she is.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i haven't looked.}
<C>__{store clerk}
<P>__{(coolly disagree ing; to woman #1)}
<D>__{my grandson's only five months old and he already has two teeth. but my daughter didn't have a single one at seven months so, y'know, how many teeth they have... doesn't mean a thing. woman #2 but didn't those friends of yours tell you what formula they usually give the baby?}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{no, actually they had to leave unexpectedly. they had to catch a plane... woman #1}
<P>__{(to peter)}
<D>__{is she teething?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{teething? woman #1 does she drool? does she cry all night long? does she chew on her fists? does she put everything into her mouth?}
<A>__{she acts out her words.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i know she can't talk. woman #2 but didn't those friends of yours tell you how old she was?}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(as woman #2 is}
<D>__{starting to get on}
<P>__{his nerves)}
<D>__{i told you they had to leave unexpectedly. woman #1 or else you could weigh her; that would tell you how old she is.}
<C>__{store clerk}
<D>__{see, my five month old grandson weighs more than my neighbor's grandson and he's nine months old. so, y'know, how much they weigh... doesn't mean a thing.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{so what about me? what should i buy? woman #2 didn't they even tell you the pediatrician's name?}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(still calm)}
<D>__{no. they didn't. woman #2 you sure have weird friends.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you have no idea how weird. woman #1 or else her hair. does she have lots of hair?}
<C>__{store clerk}
<D>__{my grandson, y'know, he has so much hair you can make a ponytail with it! and i know some kids who are totally bald at a year and a half. so, y'know, how much hair they have... doesn't mean a thing... woman #1}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{gee, he's really something, your grandson is he good at math too?}
<A>__{peter starts to pick cans off the shelf.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{look, ladies, thanks for all the advice. but i think i will just take one of each. to be on the safe side.}
<C>__{stock clerk}
<P>__{(to peter)}
<D>__{don't forget if the baby's less than three months old, you have to be sure to sterilize the bottles.}
<A>__{peter stops and turns back.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what bottles? woman #2 you know what? this must be a kidnapping.}
