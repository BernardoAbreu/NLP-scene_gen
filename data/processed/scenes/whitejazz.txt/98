<L>__{interior police headquarters morning}
<A>__{barrel down the hallway toward bradley's office. a habitual eye toward junior's desk: koenig going through his drawers. stop. veer toward him...}
<C>__{koenig}
<P>__{(formal frosty)}
<D>__{your young partner called me at my home, early this morning.}
<A>__{teeth grit. hide it. let koenig talk.}
<C>__{koenig }
<D>__{heavily inebriated. speaking inarticulately of `betrayal,' & how the lapd was set to be `blitzed by justice.' is this the `bind' of which we spoke earlier?}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{and his apartment there was some type of disturbance? a fire?}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{that's why i needed his address. i was trying to help him before something like this happened. the kid snapped in half fritz. he's literally lost it.}
<P>__{(beat, deadpan)}
<D>__{he say anything else to you?}
<A>__{koenig looks back at me. give nothing away...one gesture that doesn't read right and he'll know. he lets more seconds pass than he should. trying to shake me.}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{only that he was in possession of materials that might deeply damage chief bradley...and yourself.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{like i said fritz, he's flipped his lid. i don't want to go to internal affairs but i'm afraid junior might've forced just that.}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{let me try to locate the lad first dave. be a shame to ruin such a young career so soon.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{be careful fritz. he's dangerous.}
<A>__{spin, press on toward bradley's office.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{fritz koenig, the best inspector in the lapd, digging. he'll find junior and when he does he'll find ainge...then glenda...}
<A>__{reach bradley's office, burst in. empty. to his secretary:}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{where is he?}
<C>__{secretary}

<D>__{out at the ravine lieutenant.}
