<D>__{mrs. mulwray, may i present mr. gittes?}
<A>__{gittes walks over to her and again flashes a warm, sympathetic smile.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{how do you do, mrs. mulwray?}
<C>__{mrs. mulwray}
<D>__{mr. gittes...}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{now, mrs. mulwray, what seems to be the problem?}
<A>__{she holds her breath. the revelation isn't easy for her.}
<C>__{mrs. mulwray}
<D>__{my husband, i believe, is seeing another woman.}
<A>__{gittes looks mildly shocked. he turns for confirmation to his two partners.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(gravely)}
<D>__{no, really?}
<C>__{mrs. mulwray}
<D>__{i'm afraid so.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i am sorry.}
<A>__{gittes pulls up a chair sitting next to mrs. mulwray between duffy and walsh. duffy cracks his gum. gittes gives him an irritated glance. duffy stops chewing.}
<C>__{mrs. mulwray}
<D>__{can't we talk about this alone, mr. gittes?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i'm afraid not, mrs. mulwray. these men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. i can't do everything myself.}
<C>__{mrs. mulwray}
<D>__{of course not.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?}
<A>__{mrs. mulwray hesitates. she seems uncommonly nervous at the question.}
<C>__{mrs. mulwray}
<D>__{a wife can tell.}
<A>__{gittes sighs.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{mrs. mulwray, do you love your husband?}
<C>__{mrs. mulwray}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{...yes of course.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(deliberately)}
<D>__{then go home and forget about it.}
<C>__{mrs. mulwray}
<D>__{but...}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(staring intently at her)}
<D>__{i'm sure he loves you, too. you know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? you're better off not knowing.}
<C>__{mrs. mulwray}
<P>__{(with some real anxiety)}
<D>__{but i have to know.}
<A>__{her intensity is genuine. gittes looks to his two partners.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{all right, what's your husband's first name?}
<C>__{mrs. mulwray}
<D>__{hollis. hollis mulwray.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(visibly surprised)}
<D>__{water and power?}
<A>__{mrs. mulwray nods, almost shyly. gittes is now casually but carefully checking out the detailing of mrs. mulwray's dress her handbag, shoes, etc.}
<C>__{mrs. mulwray}
<D>__{he's the chief engineer.}
<C>__{duffy}
<P>__{(a little eagerly)}
<D>__{chief engineer?}
<A>__{gittes' glance tells duffy gittes wants to do the questioning. mrs. mulwray nods.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(confidentially)}
<D>__{this type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, mrs. mulwray. it takes time.}
<C>__{mrs. mulwray}
<D>__{money doesn't matter to me, mr. gittes.}
<A>__{gittes sighs.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{very well. we'll see what we can do.}
