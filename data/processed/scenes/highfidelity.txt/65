<A>__{rob shuts the door behind him and does a crazy charleston cabbage patch boxstep touchdown dance of pure elation, then bounces down the stairs.}

<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{rob bounces along, a smile wider than we have seen yet. maybe even jumping to touch an awning. he lands and tells us:}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i feel good! i feel great! i feel like a new man. i feel so much better, in fact }
<L>__{interior weeds bar night}
<A>__{rob moves through the room, still grinning a bit like a proud new father, toward the table where barry, dick, marie and t bone sit, listening to a story t bone is telling. marie turns to him.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{hi, marie.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{everything go alright?}
<A>__{rob glances at barry, who averts his gaze.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{she just wanted to pick up some stuff. no big thing. a relief, actually.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{god, i hate that time. that pick up stuff time. i just went through that before i came here. you know that song "patsy cline times two" i play? that's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{it's a great song.}
<C>__{marie}

<A>__{rob glances at t bone, his mind calculating the new info.}

<C>__{marie}
<D>__{yup.}
<A>__{marie slides closer, turning her back on the others. the loop is closed.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you share a place with t bone?}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{no way! i'd cramp his style. and i wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall. i'm way to unattached for that.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i understand completely.}
<A>__{series of cuts elapsed time rob and marie lean in to each other, everyone else out of focus.}
<C>__{rob }

<C>__{rob}
<D>__{what do you mean, the crumblers? you know the crumblers? nobody's heard the crumblers. except me.}

<A>__{rob glows }
<C>__{rob }
<D>__{books, records, films these things matter. call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure i was having one of the best dates of my life.}

<C>__{rob}
<D>__{yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?}
