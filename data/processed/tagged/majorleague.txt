<A>__{it's the cleveland indians' conference room. three men are seated around the table; charlie donovan. the manager, phil butler, public relations head, jerry simmons, operations director and lyle matthews director of player personnel donovan taps his pencil impatiently, obviously waiting for somebody.}

<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{good morning, gentlemen. welcome to another season of indians' baseball.}
<A>__{the men applaud, but their hearts are barely in it. the secretary bodyguard pulls out a chair at the head of the table and rachel sits.}

<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{obviously, donald didn't feel that way or he wouldn't have left the team to me. and i was more than showgirl. i was a dancer. now, i know some of you have doubts about my ability to run this franchise. god help you if i ever find out about it.}

<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i could sit here and tell you what a great year we're gonna have, but the facts are we lost the two best players we had to free agency. we haven't won a pennant in 30 years. we haven't even finished in the first division for 15. obviously it's time to make some changes. what do ya think?}

<D>__{i know you will, charlie. that's why i'm movin' you up to general manager. congratulations.}

<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{he's managed the toledo mud hens of the international league for the last 30 years.}

<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{what exactly is our team concept?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{that's what i wanted to talk to you about. i want to put together a team that will help us relocate to miami.}

<D>__{what do you mean?}
<P>__{(referring to the roster)}
<D>__{some of these guys are furniture movers?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i'm serious about this, charlie. it's no secret i've never liked cleveland much. the weather's lousy, downtown is a pit, the stadium's falling apart, and we can't draw dick. another couple of years of this and i'm gonna have to start feeding cha cha dog food.}
<A>__{rachel bends down to give her dog, cha cha, a little love pat, while donovan tries to contain his disgust.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{mrs. phelps, you can't just up and move a team on a whim...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{it's hardly a whim. miami's offered to build us a new stadium 62,000 capacity, 45 v.i.p. boxes, and no rent for the first million at the gate. plus a 12 million dollar media guarantee; 45 percent of the concession gross, all of the parking and they pick up the stadium operations costs. no other franchise in baseball can match that deal.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{even so, the league'll never let us leave cleveland. we got a lease with the city.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{the lease says we have the right to move if our attendance falls below 800,000 for the year.}

<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{what are you saying? you want us to lose?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{no, we've been losing. what i want us to do is finish dead last.}

<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{mister phelps would never have approved of this.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{he knew it had to be done. he just didn't have the courage to do it.}
<P>__{(with veiled menace)}
<D>__{hopefully, you will come to see the wisdom of it.}

<D>__{if we ever lost the indians, cleveland would die.}

<D>__{hello, everybody, harry doyle here, welcoming all you friends of the feather to another season of indians baseball.}
<P>__{(pouring some jack daniels in his coke)}
<D>__{a lotta new faces for the tribe this year, as they take on the defending american league champs, the new york yankees. and listen to the roar of the crowd as the indians takes the field!}

<D>__{yes, sir, they love this club here in cleveland.}

<B>__{hayes}
<A>__{going through his warmup routine at the plate.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{a lotta people say you can tell how a season's gonna go by the first hitter of the year. in the last fifteen years, the indians have never had the season lead off hitter reach base.}
<A>__{hayes is in the batter's box now. the yankee pitcher winds and fires. hayes swings and hits a little dribbler toward the second baseman, who races in and scoops it up bare handed.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{hot shot toward the hole. rudia knocks it down, gets up, fires to first. too late! hayes beats it!}
<A>__{doyle leans out the window again trying to pick up some cheering.}

<C>__{first baseman}
<D>__{you look real sharp, but you'll never steal second with your shoe untied.}
<A>__{hayes looks down at his shoe. it's not untied. he notices too late that the pitcher is throwing over to pick him off.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{brewster, quick move to first...}
<A>__{hayes dives back for the bag, but never gets there; his face smashing up against the first baseman's glove, which is already holding the ball.}

<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{well, so much for that.}
<A>__{doyle takes a long pull on his coke and we go into a montage depicting the indians' progressive disintegration in this game. we see: a) three fielders converging on a short pop fly into left field. they all collide and go down in a heap as the ball drops untouched. b) dorn playing a grounder off his hip. he fumbles it, picks it up, fumbles it again. no play. c) taylor crouched behind the plate, but up off his haunches, ready to throw. we hear the voice of his thoughts.}
<C>__{taylor's voice}
<D>__{guy's goin'. gotta be goin'... get the throw up. don't bounce the damn ball.}
<A>__{the runner on first takes off as the pitch comes in. taylor catches the ball and fires down to second. the ball sails three feet over the second baseman's head and on into center field. taylor stands there, disgusted.}
<C>__{taylor's voice}
<D>__{nice throw, dickhead.}
<A>__{d) cerrano striking out on a curve ball. he bawls his bat out on the way to the dugout. e) the three fielders we saw before, converging on another pop fly into short left. this time all three dive off at the last instant to avoid a collision. once again the ball drops untouched.}

<D>__{don't worry if you're off the plate on a few pitches. doesn't hurt to put the fear of god in a hitter.}
<A>__{vaughn nods and continues to grind the ball as pepper and taylor leave. the yankee hitter steps in. vaughn winds and fires a screamer. taylor has to leap high to come down with it.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{first pitch is a little high...}
<A>__{the yankee hitter is slightly unnerved by this pitch.}
<C>__{yankee hitter}
<D>__{this guy kinda wild?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i figure you got a 30% chance to survive this at bat.}
<A>__{another pitch to the yankee hitter. it's outside.}

<A>__{another pitch to a second yankee hitter. it's low.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{ball eight.}
<A>__{another pitch to a third yankee hitter. he has to jump over it.}
<C>__{doyle }

<C>__{pepper}
<D>__{just relax, and keep the arm up on top. gotta throw strikes. no place at the inn for this guy.}
<A>__{he gives vaughn a pat on the butt, and goes back to the dugout. the yankee hitter, haywood, stands in. he's the first baseman who tagged hayes out.}

<D>__{hey, taylor, what you doin' back up here?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{couldn't cut it in the mexican league.}
<A>__{vaughn, determined to throw a strike, winds and delivers. the ball is a perfect strike, right down the middle. haywood crushes it to deep left field. vaughn drops his head, not even bothering to look.}

<D>__{oh, shit...}
<A>__{the ball lands in the second deck; a grand slam home run.}

<C>__{brown}
<D>__{no, let's see how he reacts.}
<A>__{vaughn paces around on the mound, rubbing up the ball. the next hitter, coleman, steps in. vaughn gets up on the rubber, his face set. he winds up and fires one right into coleman's back. coleman goes down in a hurry.}

<D>__{interesting.}
<C>__{pepper}
<D>__{at least he hit what he was aimin' at.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i think you can go get him now.}
<A>__{both benches are up on the dugout steps ready to come out. the only thing holding them back is that coleman is being tended to by the trainer. the home plate umpire thumbs vaughn out of the game. vaughn comes down to protest, but pepper quickly grabs him and hurries him off the field.}
<C>__{pepper}
<D>__{c'mon, kid. as soon as coleman gets up, he's gonna be lookin' for you.}
<A>__{coleman finally gets to his feet, still a little shaken. he looks around for vaughn, but he's already disappeared into the dugout. coleman walks down to first under his own power. brown signals for a new pitcher and the players on both sides begin to return to the benches.}

<A>__{walking alone down the tunnel to the locker room. he angrily knocks one of the overhead light bulbs out with his glove. doyle in the press box later that night he now has five empty cups next to the mike, plus a near empty bottle of jack daniel's.}

<A>__{lynn comes out of the dressing room into the pool area, deserted this time of night. she wears a racing suit, but lets her hair hang free. the pool glows like a sheet of emerald glass. she shakes down a beat, curls her toes around the coping, slowly bends at the waist, and then launches into a full out racing dive. we watch as she swims a 100 yard individual medley; first the butterfly, then the backstroke, breaststroke and finally freestyle. we condense the time, of course, shooting some underwater, some slo mo, as she knives through the water, her hair flowing behind her, an athlete alone with her medium. the sequence should convey not only the grace of her strokes and her athletic ability, but the fluid beauty of swimming, its synthesis of power and form. as she begins the freestyle leg, another body appears in the pool next to her. it's jake, and he's racing her the final lap. she immediately responds to the challenge, digging harder, picking up her kick. they go neck and neck for 20 yards, but lynn has one more gear and touches him by half a body length at the wall. both are winded.}

<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(for haywood's ears)}
<D>__{let's see, what should we call now. let's see how he feels about old number one.}
<A>__{taylor puts down one finger. vaughn nods and then winds and fires again, another blazing rocket. haywood takes a wicked rip, but doesn't get it. strike two. 99 comes up on the gun. the convict has stopped jumpin'.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{nice swing, haywood. good follow through. keep it up, i will show you the ball sometime.}
<A>__{the fans are going wild. they're all standing now, yelling for a strikeout. vaughn gets back up on the rubber with the look of an animal sighting prey. taylor gets down to give the sign. dugout (insert storyboard # 216r)}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{forget the curveball. go with the heater.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{well, shit, all these pitches to choose from. maybe we'll try somethin' different this time.}
<A>__{taylor wiggles his fingers around and then puts down the big no. 1. vaughn gives him a quick nod.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{and if i don't see you again, haywood, have a nice winter. okay, buddy?}
<A>__{vaughn goes into his windup and unleashes a screaming bullet toward the plate. haywood pulls the trigger, but it's already by him. strike three. 101 on the gun. taylor leaps up and gives vaughn the fist. the fans are going berserk. music ends.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{oh, lordy, three straight heaters and the yankees are blown down. no runs, two hits, three left on, and, are you ready, cleveland? we go to the bottom of the ninth, still tied at two.}

<D>__{two down in the ninth, hayes steps in hitting .291, trying to get something going for the tribe.}
<A>__{taylor and the others yell encouragement to hayes as he digs in at the plate. the yankee pitcher delivers and hayes hits a high bouncer toward short. the shortstop waits for it to come down and then fires to first. too late. hayes streaks across the bag, beating the throw by a hair. once again the crowd comes to life. the yankee manager comes to the mound and waves for a new pitcher.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{and horton is wasting no time. he's goin' to the duke.}
<A>__{out of the pen comes billy duke, a good facsimile of goose gossage only duke is bigger and meaner. (insert storyboard #219m)}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{duke leads the league in saves, strikeouts per inning and nose hairs.}
<A>__{the duke finishes his warmups and stares over at hayes. hayes smiles, snaps his black gloves out of his hip pocket, and carefully pulls them on over his hands. the duke does not care for this kind of showmanship. brown comes over to talk to taylor, who's been watching duke from the on deck circle.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{ya know i'd be an ass not to pinch hit for you here. you're 0 for 18 against duke. plus you're beat to shit you can hardly walk, there's no way you can get around on this guy's fast ball. so i want the absolute truth here. can you beat this guy?}

<D>__{send hayes the first pitch. i don't want taylor takin' too many strikes.}
<A>__{pepper begins flashing signs out to hayes. duke gets up on the rubber and takes his stretch. hayes leads away, crouching low. duke snaps a throw over to first, the first baseman slapping a hard tag on hayes, but hayes is back. the crowd is on its feet again. the "go" chant starts, punctuated by thousands of black gloved hands punching the night air. duke comes set again. hayes leads away. duke watches him, checks him again. we go to slow motion as duke kicks and comes to the plate. hayes takes off like a shot, head down, eating up ground. taylor swings and misses. the yankee catcher comes up throwing, rifling a clothesline dart to second base. hayes leaves his feet diving for the bag. the second baseman snaps down the tag. too late. hayes is in there. the stadium is really rockin' now. duke prowls the mound. taylor steps out of the box and flashes a sign to brown.}

<D>__{what's he doing?}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{flashing some signals. that's a hell of an idea.}
<A>__{brown flashes a sign out to hayes. a hint of a smile comes over hayes' face as he dusts himself off. taylor steps back in as duke gets up on the rubber. taylor digs in his back foot, then points to the left field bleachers ala babe ruth.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{what's this? taylor is pointing to the bleachers, calling his shot.}
<A>__{the crowd, electrified by taylor's gesture, remains on its feet. duke stares in at taylor, comes to his stretch and then lets go a steaming fast ball right at taylor's head. taylor goes down in a swirl of dust, the ball missing him by inches. the stadium explodes with boos, but as soon as taylor picks himself up, the crowd begins to roar again. bobby, vic and johnny are pounding out a heavy beat on the tom toms. everyone in the stadium begins to clap in unison with the drums. taylor steps back in and once again points to the bleachers.}

<D>__{unbelievable. they're on their feet here, stomping, clapping. c'mon, join in wherever you are out there. let's hear you, cleveland.}
<B>__{the longshoremen}

<A>__{everything from here on will continue to be in slow motion. as duke whips his arm toward the plate, hayes takes off for third. taylor, instead of swinging away, shortens up on the bat and bunts duke's pitch down the third base line. the yankee third baseman, caught completely unaware, charges the ball frantically.}
<B>__{taylor}

<A>__{of our other fans. we see... a) the business executive stand up and yell "yes!" in the middle of the opera. several other men stand up and express their excitement as well. b) the longshoremen whoop it up in their bar exchanging fives and hugs with the punkers and heavy metal kids. c) the various apartment dwellers dancing, clapping, yelling out the windows. d) the two korean groundskeepers just shaking their heads in amazement. e) elsewhere in the stadium, the joyous exultation continues unabated. the crowd pours onto the field as hayes runs toward taylor and literally leaps into his arms. f) the two spin around throwing their fists in the air. g) cerrano and harris embrace. dorn gives vaughn a hug, then steps back and decks him with a right hand. h) dorn pulls vaughn back to his feet, and they hug again. i) up in the stands, rachel watches all this with tears in her eyes. taylor starts off the field when he sees something that catches his eye. standing by the field rail is lynn. she holds up her left hand and smiles. there's no ring on it. taylor races over to her as she jumps down from the rail and hugs herself to him. we hold on the celebration as it swirls all around them, and...}
