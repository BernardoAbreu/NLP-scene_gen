<L>__{exterior back of marty's bar}
<A>__{marty is sitting on the stoop that descends from his back office to a graveled back parking lot; he is framed in the open doorway of his brightly lit office. he stares fixedly at something offscreen. marty's pov in the middle distance a huge incinerator operates full blast. orange flames lick out the sides; white smoke billows out the top. two figures in silhouette are chucking garbage in through a large gate.}
<B>__{back to marty}
<A>__{behind him, in the office, we see the door from the bar open, and ray entering.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{marty?}
<A>__{marty looks over his shoulder, then back toward the furnace. ray descends the stoop and stands in front of him.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...well...? what?}
<A>__{marty stares past ray across the parking lot.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{what "what"?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{am i fired? you wanna hit me? what?}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{i don't particularly want to talk to you.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{well... if you're not gonna fire me i might as well quit.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{fine. suit yourself.}
<P>__{(still staring fixedly at the furnace)}
<D>__{...having a good time?}
<A>__{ray tenses. there is a pause.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...i don't like this kind of talk.}
<A>__{marty still stares at the furnace.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{then what'd you come here for?}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(no more conciliation)}
<D>__{you owe me for two weeks.}
<A>__{marty shakes his head.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{nope. she's an expensive piece of ass...}
<A>__{he finally looks up at ray.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{...you get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i want that money. if you wanna tell me something, fine }
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{what're you, a fucking marriage counselor?}
<A>__{ray breaks into a strained half smile. marty grins humorlessly back, mimicking ray's smile.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{what're you smiling at i'm a funny guy, right, i'm an asshole? no, no, that's not what's funny. what's funny is her. what's funny is that i had you two followed because, if it isn't you, she's been sleeping with someone else...}
<A>__{he grabs a knee in each hand and leans forward, still looking at ray. he is becoming only slightly more animated.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{...what's really going to be funny is when she gives you that innocent look and says, what're you talking about, ray, i haven't done anything funny...}
<A>__{he leans back again.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{...but the funniest thing to me right now is that you think she came back here for you that's what's funny.}
<A>__{ray moves forward and marty's eyes follow him as he approaches. marty's smile abruptly turns to a look of apprehension. ray enters frame and brushes past marty as he walks up the stoop, and crosses the back office toward the bar. marty relaxes, and his gaze returns to the furnace.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{...come on this property again and i will be forced to shoot you...}
<A>__{ray opens the door to the bar and shuts it softly behind him.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{...fair notice.}
<A>__{marty's office later}
<B>__{close shot ceiling fan}
<A>__{at the cut the music and all other bar noise drops out. we hear only the rhythmic whir of the fan. we tilt down from the ceiling fan to frame marty, tilted back in his desk chair, staring up at the fan.}
<C>__{meurice }
<D>__{marty...}
<B>__{wide shot the office}
<A>__{meurice is standing in the door to the bar. far behind him we can see debra waiting in the dimly lit, deserted bar.}
<C>__{meurice}
<D>__{...i thought you were dead. going home?}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{no. i think i will stay right here in hell.}
<C>__{meurice}
<P>__{(turning to leave)}
<D>__{kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it marty?}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{meurice...}
<A>__{meurice pauses in the doorway.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{...i don't want that asshole near my money. i don't even want him in the bar.}
<C>__{meurice}
<D>__{we get a lot of assholes in here, marty.}
<A>__{meurice and debra can be heard leaving the bar. marty looks down at the telephone in front of him on the desk, then picks up the receiver and dials. he tilts back in the chair and stares back up at the ceiling. marty's pov the ceiling fan, turning slowly.}
