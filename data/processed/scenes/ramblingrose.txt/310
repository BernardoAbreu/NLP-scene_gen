<L>__{interior hillyer home rose's bedroom night}
<A>__{a shot of rose in bed in her own bedroom. she is propped up on pillows and wearing a rather attractive pink silk housecoat of mother's. a tray is on her lap and she is eating her supper as buddy sits on the edge of the bed talking with her, or rather listening to her. it is obvious she is well on the road back to health.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{rose, you are too uncritical of people.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{you don't know the bedside manner that man has got. why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. and even more important he loves me, like a patient i mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{he did?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{yeah, he tried to hide it but i saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "you know, you are beautiful." now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? what could cheer a girl up more?}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{rose, i have got doubts about that doctor and so does daddy.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{he's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{yeah, i'd believe it.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{well, i like him. i used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. why, he could operate on me any old time and i wouldn't even be scared.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i ain't neither. listen here, buddy, besides all his vast medical knowledge, he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts he wants justice in the world and he's got some real interestin' ideas.}
