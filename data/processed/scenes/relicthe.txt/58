<L>__{exterior museum night}
<A>__{all is quiet.}
<L>__{interior museum front exhibit front door night}
<A>__{the doors to the exhibit are closed. doyle looks at his watch, impatient. it's almost eleven now. he pulls out his walkie talkie.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{bailey? doyle here. i'm still waiting outside the exhibit. where the hell is mcnitt?}
<C>__{bailey}
<D>__{should be there any minute. they came out a side door a while ago. said the exhibit's clear. mcnitt's headed back to spell you.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{i'm on double over time, man.}
<C>__{bailey}
<D>__{i know. you can go home if you want to. i will come relieve you myself.}
<A>__{doyle shuts off his walkie talkie, frowns. he fidgets, looks at his watch once more.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{what the hell.}
<A>__{he turns, takes off the walkie talkie and leaves it, but then he hears something, stops. it's a low scuffling from inside the exhibit, coming from behind the closed doors. doyle freezes, turns.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{mcnitt?}
<A>__{no answer. doyle pauses. his hand goes to his gun for reassurance as he hears a footstep and a muffled thump. he moves to the door of the exhibit, opens it and takes a step inside.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{mcnitt? cut the crap. i know it's you. you're not scaring me. come on.}
<A>__{silence meets him. the shadows of the exhibit loom. doyle takes one more step inside, scanning the darkness with his gun. does he hear breathing? he freezes. yes, he does. the hair on his neck rises and he loses the spit in his mouth. he takes a step backwards, but he's half a second too late. the door slams behind him and a huge dark form leaps out!}
