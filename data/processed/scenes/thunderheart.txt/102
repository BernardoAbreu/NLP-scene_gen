<A>__{the high winds of three media helicopters are delighting a storm of indian children and barking dogs, running through the streets past junked cars on blocks. over on a little plot of grass and dirt, a pair of hands are digging a small hole. ray lays a pine cone in the hole and looks down at it for a moment... before hand plowing the dirt back over it and patting it flat. he rises, knocking dirt off his knees and hands. crow horse walks over, bandaged and favoring wounds, and ray falls in with him, walking down the middle of the village road. his eyes are tired. but hopeful.}

<A>__{ray goes to get in his car. but he sees someone sitting across the street on the trading post porch. the old man. ray considers him for a moment then walks over. they lock eyes. grandpa stares at ray as if he's never seen him before, and then arcs a brow. he touches his sleeve at the wrist. ray rolls his sleeve back to reveal his rolex. grandpa smiles and ray strips it off. he hands it to the old man and his face crinkles into caliche earth. grandpa holds the watch up in the light, admires it then puts it in his shirt pocket. he moves a flat hand through the air in the "done deal" sign language. ray, a little surprised that he gets nothing in the trade, returns the smile and walks away. he gets to his car and wipes away two inches of dust from the broken windshield.}
