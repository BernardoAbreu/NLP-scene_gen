<L>__{interior bathroom night}
<A>__{ned enters. hot water gushes from the faucet into a clawfoot bathtub. he turns the water off, looking around, puzzled. loosens his tie, rubs his head. a splitting headache. opens the medicine cabinet and... screech! yeow! crash! a cat leaps out!... darts away. there's a noise from downstairs.}
<L>__{interior the kitchen moments later}
<A>__{someone is pounding on the door. ned enters and opens it. it's laura.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{ned! i'm glad you're here. i have so much to tell you.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{come on in. i will make some tea. grab a chair.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{thanks... i brought my own.}
<A>__{she drags a chair in behind her, sits at the kitchen table. ned puts a kettle on the burner, turns it on. he starts searching through the cupboard for teabags.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{so... what have you got?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{a lottery ticket and a laundry receipt.}
<P>__{(lays them on table)}
<D>__{i found them in the pocket of that suit you wore the night you were working under cover with a client.}
<A>__{ned freezes, staring out the window, unable to face her.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you remember that night, don't ya ned? then it hit me. lottery starts with l o. laundry starts with l a. l o... l a. lola.}
<A>__{ned turns to her when he hears lola's name... looking baffled by this convoluted piece of logic.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(shrugs it off)}
<D>__{don't sweat it. it's the way a woman's mind works.}
<A>__{he turns back to the cupboard, picking up a container.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{how about ovaltine?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{fine. then i remembered you told me some guy named frank had been working on your wife's car for two months. you with me so far?}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i'm way ahead of you.}
<A>__{he brings the ovaltine container to the table.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{well back it up. you probably took a wrong turn. remember your insurance policy... the one we couldn't find? i started thinking, who else had access to it beside you and me? the answer came up... lana. and since she's a woman, it's probably hidden right here.}
<A>__{a huge ceramic cookie jar sits on the table in front of them. laura smashes it with her fist, breaking it open! cookies spill out... and the insurance policy.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{so that's where she hid the oreos.}
<A>__{he sits down... starts eating oreos... twisting them apart.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{ned, lana wasn't trying to save your life when she shot max shady. she and frank were plotting to kill you and collect on your insurance policy. but she shot the wrong guy.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{that's the craziest thing i ever heard.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(she presses on)}
<D>__{don't you see... frank was going to let her take the fall. so she murdered him and tried to make it look like suicide.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that's when i realized there was a connection between lola and lana...}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{yeah... they're sisters. twin sisters.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{well, hang on to your jock strap, ned. there's more.}
<A>__{she unrolls a complex genealogical chart... walks him thru it.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{not only is frank's father dwayne kelbo, notoriously amorous gym teacher and lola cain's former lover... frank's mother is helen shady. max and frank are half brothers who never met.}
<A>__{laura pauses dramatically, then announces.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{your lovely wife, lana, murdered both of helen shady's sons.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{this is so unbelievable.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{and you haven't even heard my story.}
