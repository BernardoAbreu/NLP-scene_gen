<A>__{pete is sitting perched unsteadily on the very edge of his bed. he hears a succession of highly amplified sounds at intervals with eerie stretches of silence: crickets in fractured cadence a distant television a fly buzzing slowly in the room a moth's wings beating against light bulbs in the ceiling fixture the washing of dishes. pete's reaction to these sounds is one of petrified confusion. underlying these sounds is a kind of unearthly, steady drone. pete gets up off the bed, unsteadily. he moves toward his bedroom door. as he moves the amplified sounds shift. he can hear laughter. the laughter seems to be loud, but at the same time coming from people who are trying to contain the laughter to hide it. pete opens his door and peers out. pete's pov down the hall toward the living room his mother and father have stopped laughing and are turned with guilty smiles in his direction. they are smoking a joint, passing it back and forth. they are not looking directly at him. they seem to be looking, but not seeing. pete's parents pov down the hall toward pete's room. there is no one there just an empty hallway. pete's parents continue to stare, but then turn away toward each other they start to laugh quietly again. pete's pov the hallway and the living room there is no one in the living room. it's empty.}
