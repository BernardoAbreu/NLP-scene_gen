<D>__{we've got forty partners vested at the moment. close to six hundred associates. this is the home office, but we've got quite a few international arrangements, so mr. milton spends a good deal of his time in the air. in addition to our corporate clients, we're currently representing about twenty five foreign countries. mid east, balkans, central america, west africa. interesting work, but travel intensive.}
