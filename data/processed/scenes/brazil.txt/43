<A>__{to other side of opening as sam topples through. he catches himself in the nick of time as the camera zooms back revealing his close call with disaster. he is high on a vast wall of what looks like filing cabinets. the hatch he came through was the front of one of the millions of files drawers composing this wall. as he scrambles back into the opening we can see that the wall drops away for hundreds of feet, disappear into a steaming mist. other walls of files enclose this vast space. from where sam is it looks like the view from the 50th storey of the time life building in nyc. these millions of files are being tended by men arising themselves up and down, as well as sideways, on modern skyscraper window cleaners' platforms. the attendants are seen putting people in different period costumes into drawers. sam's attention is distracted by a sound overhead. looking up he sees a window washer platform being lowered in his direction. leaning over the side is a jolly gent, who happens to look like mr helpmann (as seen on tv).}
<C>__{gent}
<D>__{ah ha ... there you are, sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what? how do you know my name?}
<C>__{gent}
<D>__{we know everything here. this is the storeroom of knowledge.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(climbing onto the platform)}
<D>__{then perhaps you can help me. i've lost someone who ...}
<C>__{gent}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{we know that too. you've come to the right place.}
<A>__{the platform carries them along the files.}
<C>__{gent}
<D>__{oh, yes. we've got everything here. every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{what? you mean you've got ...}
<C>__{gent}
<D>__{well not exactly. but, if you help us we'll help you. the forces of darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what do i have to do.}
<C>__{gent}
<D>__{you must save the day.}
<A>__{the platform has stopped. the gent pulls out a drawer. he reaches inside. the gent pulls out a wonderful sword and helmet.}
<C>__{gent}
<D>__{this is the sword of truth ... and this the helmet of justice.}
<A>__{as sam begins to strap on the weapon the gent brings out a cape.}
<C>__{gent}
<D>__{and this. completes the outfit.}
<A>__{he puts the cape around sam's shoulders and helps him step into the drawer. a moment's hesitation and then sam outs the helmet on and lies down in the drawer. it fits just like a coffin.. as he lies back the gent pushes the drawer in.}
<C>__{gent}
<D>__{it won't be pleasant but, trust me.}
<A>__{as the drawer is pushed in sam suffers a sudden bout of claustrophobia. looking up at the diministing opening he is surprised to see not the face of the jolly gent but a terrifying samurai warrior's masked helmet. sam struggles to prevent the drawer being closed.}
