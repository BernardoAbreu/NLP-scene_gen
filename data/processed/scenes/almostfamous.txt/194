<L>__{interior new tour bus day}
<A>__{the band rides in a new tour bus. the palpable tone in the air is panic.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{look. let's just piece together our information... because the fact checker asked us all about different parts of the story.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{what did he write about? what's he using?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{it. all.}
<A>__{he's using it all.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{so what?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{so what?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we come off like amateurs... some average band... trying to come to grips, jealous and fighting and breaking up we're buffoons!}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{maybe we just don't see ourselves the way we really are.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{he was supposed to be our friend.}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(ruefully, remembering)}
<D>__{i told him to write what he wanted.}
<A>__{all eyes look to russell.}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(to russell)}
<D>__{by the way, he has you on acid, screaming "i am a golden god" from a fan's rooftop.}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(immediately remembering)}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{they used him to fuck us.}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(still back at "golden god")}
<D>__{i didn't say "golden god." or did i?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{we never took him seriously, and now it's serious.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{i liked him as a person.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{he was never a "person!" he was a journalist!}
<A>__{russell nods. he looks at silent ed, drumming soundlessly on a rubber pad.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{you. you had the right idea all along.}
<A>__{ed silently nods thanks.}
<C>__{dennis hope}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{how about the plane flight?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{it's all in there. but don't worry, it's all unspecific who say what. no names are mentioned in the more embarrassing sequences, it's just completely obvious who's who! we're fucked!}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{i forgot he was there.}
<C>__{dennis hope}
<D>__{well, they haven't talked to russell he can always deny the key stuff to the fact checker. then they can't print it.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(brightening)}
<D>__{is that true?}
<C>__{dennis hope}
<D>__{it's war, my friend. if you'd met me earlier, he would have never been on the around.}
<A>__{dennis hands russell the phone.}
<C>__{dennis hope }
<D>__{he'll live.}
