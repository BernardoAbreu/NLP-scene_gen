<A>__{looking out, she sees the broken down garden from the real world, still grey and lifeless in the dim light.}
<L>__{exterior other garden same}
<A>__{coraline opens the gate to the garden. a large crescent moon rises, and things start to grow. two dead shrubs start to rise, then blossom, then the blossoms themselves are lit up by some gold and amber}
<B>__{hummingbirds.}
<A>__{the hummingbirds circle around coraline, light her dragonfly barrette, then continue on, lighting up pitcher plants that have grown up in a nearby flower bed. a beautiful frog pokes out of one blossom. the birds lead coraline up steps past a stone wall where bleeding heart grow, and glow, and beat. she spots the other father, riding a praying mantis tractor on the hillside, planting seeds that instantly grow into flowering plants.}
<C>__{other father}
<D>__{hey!!!}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{i love your garden!}
<A>__{he waves back, calling:}
<C>__{other father}
<D>__{our garden, coraline!}
<A>__{a gang of snap dragons goes at her, tickling coraline till she falls down. her squeals of delight grow into}
<B>__{hysterical laughter.}
<C>__{coraline}
<P>__{(giggling)}
<D>__{oh ah, stop! stop tickling, ah!}
<A>__{the other father hears this and looks over.}
<C>__{other father}
<D>__{oops, daughter in distress!}
<A>__{he guns the tractor full speed over a little bridge, grabbing a gourd trumpet from a vine and blowing it. jack o lanterns surface in the pond below and spout}
<B>__{streams of water.}
<A>__{arriving beside coraline, he waggles his finger at the naughty snapdragons.}
<C>__{other father }
<D>__{tickle no more, you dragon snappers!}
<A>__{then he deftly cuts a bouquet of them and presents it to coraline. she nods thanks.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{well, she says it's time for dinner ... breakfast ... food?}
<C>__{other father}
<D>__{hop on, kiddo, i want to show you something!}
<A>__{she does. the other father grabs the gearshift knob, pulls it, and the mechanical mantis sprouts wings. they rise in the air. looking down, she sees that the garden is a portrait of coraline.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{i can't believe you did this!}
<C>__{other father}
<D>__{mother said you'd like it! boy she knows you like the back of her hand.}
<A>__{he pulls a lever and they zoom out of frame.}
