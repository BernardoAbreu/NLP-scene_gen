<L>__{interior carl's apartment}
<A>__{carl walks into his apartment. he hits play on his answering machine.}
<C>__{peter }
<P>__{(over the answering machine)}
<D>__{carl, it's peter. i know you don't do things anymore, but it'd mean a lot if you'd come by rudy's tonight. lucy and i are celebrating our engagement.}
<L>__{interior carl's apartment later}
<A>__{carl's watching hell's kitchen and eating a frozen pizza. there's a knock on the door. the "just say yes" pamphlet balled up on his desk. he's using it as a napkin. carl pauses the television show. he stands up and opens the door. peter stumbles in.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{this is an intervention. you've missed your last event.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{what're you talking about?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{our engagement party.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm just really busy.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you're watching hell's kitchen. that's not even b list reality tv.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{so i don't want to go out tonight. maybe i have to wake up early tomorrow. you don't know.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{it's bigger than that. you and kath broke up over a year ago and you still aren't dating anyone.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{what? so? i'm like a sexual camel. i only need it once every couple years.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i don't mean to be harsh but everyone's moving forward. it's like you're still wearing a timex while the rest of us each have entry level rolexes.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you wear a rolex?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{thanks for noticing. it's an oyster perpetual yachtmaster. sapphire crystal, self winding. four gs. but that's not the point i'm trying to make.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{so i don't have an oyster watch. all you and lucy and kath do is sit around and talk about real estate and crate and barrel.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what's wrong with crate and barrel? they have adorable stuff at reasonable prices.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{forget crate and barrel. maybe i'm just getting more mature. i don't need the lifestyle ever night.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{lifestyle? you have to have a life to have a style of life. you never leave your apartment. you never meet anyone new.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i hate meeting people.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you've become a complete cave dweller.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i am not a cave dweller. just the other day, we all went to summerfest and snuck backstage and you bet me i wouldn't steal something and so i stole a drumstick from that horrible swedish hillbilly band. that's not very cave dweller of me.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{just the other day? that was seven years ago.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{but that's not possible i was already working at the bank by then.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you had started there three years earlier. why you've worked at that place for so long is beyond me. you had so much potential. you shouldn't be a teller. you should be the guy who tells the guy who tells the teller what to do.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{i've been a teller at southwest bank for ten years? how the hell did that happen?}
<P>__{(doing the math)}
<D>__{ten years... if i had had a child, he'd be toilet trained by now.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{actually, he'd be in fourth grade.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(starting to panic)}
<D>__{i was making out with chicks by fourth grade. i was a little man by fourth grade.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{whatever. i don't need this shit right now. i'm an adult man. i can live my life as i see fit. can you please leave?}
<A>__{carl pushes peter out the door. carl sits down on the couch. he then unballs the "just say yes" pamphlet. it features an indian man smiling beatifically.}
