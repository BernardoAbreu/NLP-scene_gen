<L>__{exterior a small building and stable night}
<A>__{anna shuffles up to the building, her dress frozen stiff. she shakes the snow off a sign and reads:}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{wandering oaken's trading post.}
<A>__{snow drops off a smaller sign. she reads it, happily.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{ooh! and sauna...}
<L>__{interior wandering oaken's trading post & sauna night}
<A>__{anna steps cautiously through the door which hits her frozen butt and knocks her into the center of the shop. she looks around, sees only summer supplies.}
<C>__{oaken }
<D>__{hoo hoo.}
<A>__{anna turns to see a bright faced fellow sitting low behind the counter, fingers tapping tip to tip.}
<C>__{oaken }
<D>__{big summer blow out. half off swimming suits, clogs, and a sun balm of my own invention, yah?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{oh, great. for now, how about boots. winter boots...and dresses?}
<C>__{oaken}
<P>__{(slight disappointment)}
<D>__{that would be in our winter department.}
<A>__{the winter department contains one outfit, a pick ax, and a lonely pair of boots.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{oh. um, i was just wondering; has another young woman, the queen perhaps, i don't know, passed through here?}
<A>__{she brings the clothes and boots to the counter.}
<C>__{oaken}
<D>__{only one crazy enough to be out in this storm is you, dear?}
<A>__{the front door suddenly blows open and in walks a mass of a man covered in ice. underneath is kristoff.}
<C>__{oaken }
<D>__{you and this fellow.... hoo hoo. big summer blow out.}
<A>__{kristoff walks right up to anna.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<P>__{(in her face)}
<D>__{carrots.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{behind you.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{oh, right. excuse me.}
<A>__{anna moves out of kristoff's way. he grabs a bunch of carrots, tosses them on the counter, then moves through the place, gathering other supplies.}
<C>__{oaken}
<P>__{(to kristoff)}
<D>__{a real howler in july, yah? where ever could it be coming from?}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{the north mountain.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{north mountain.}
<A>__{kristoff brings his supplies to the counter. oaken counts on his fingertips.}
<C>__{oaken}
<D>__{that'll be forty.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{forty? no, ten.}
<C>__{oaken}
<P>__{(sweet as pie)}
<D>__{oh dear, that's no good. see these are from our winter stock, where supply and demand have a big problem.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{you want to talk about a supply and demand problem? i sell ice for a living.}
<A>__{kristoff motions out the window, where we see the blocks of ice on his sled, covered in snow.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{ooh, that's a rough business to be in right now. i mean, that is really...}
<P>__{(he shoots her a look)}
<D>__{ahem. that's unfortunate.}
<C>__{oaken}
<D>__{still forty. but i will throw in a visit to oaken's sauna. hoo hoo! hi, family.}
<A>__{kristoff and anna turn to see a naked family waving through the window of the steaming sauna.}
<C>__{naked family}
<D>__{hoo hoo!}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{...ten's all i got. help me out.}
<C>__{oaken}
<P>__{(isolating the carrots)}
<D>__{ten will get you this and no more.}
<A>__{kristoff seethes. stalemate.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{okay, just tell me one thing; what was happening on the north mountain? did it seem magical?}
<A>__{kristoff pulls down his scarf and gives anna a firm answer.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{yes! now, back up while i deal with this crook here.}
<A>__{oaken stands up, revealing his seven foot stature.}
<C>__{oaken}
<D>__{what did you call me?}
