<L>__{interior the ottos house. day}
<A>__{mitchell walks into the otto residence. it is a large two storey space divided into several smaller chambers with sheets of brightly colored cloth tie dyes and indian madras that hang from wires. on a low brick platform in the centre of the main chamber is a large wood burning stove. a few feet from the stove, sitting on an overstuffed cushion, is hartley otto. hartley is listening to music on his headphones. he is very stoned. wanda moves over, and pulls the headphones off her husband's head.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{we have a guest. what did you say your name was?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{mitchell stephens.}
<A>__{mitchell hands them a card. hartley reads it with deliberation.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{the walkers sent him by.}
<A>__{hartley rises up. he stares at mitchell. a tense pause.}
<C>__{hartley}
<D>__{you want a cup of tea or something?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{a cup of tea would be nice.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{would it be alright if i sit down for a few minutes, mrs. otto? i want to talk to you.}
<A>__{wanda stares at mitchell. no response. mitchell waits a beat, then seats himself rather uncomfortably on a large pillow. he is unsure whether to cross his legs, or fold them under his chin.}
<C>__{mitchell }
<D>__{the walkers spoke very highly of you.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{you've been retained?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{their child died, and they got a lawyer.}
<A>__{pause. mitchell assesses wanda's energy.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{it should be said that my task is to represent the walkers only in their anger. not their grief.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{who did they get for that?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{you are angry, aren't you, mrs. otto? that's why i'm here. to give your anger a voice. to be your weapon against whoever caused that bus to go off the road.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{dolores?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{it's my belief that dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years. besides, the school board's insurance on dolores is minimal. a few million at the very most. the really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{you think someone else caused the accident?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{mrs. otto, there is no such thing as an accident. the word doesn't mean anything to me. as far as i'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner. some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten cent bolt and a million dollar out of court settlement. they decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference. that's what's done, mrs. otto. i've seen it happen so many times before.}
<A>__{hartley returns with the tea.}
<C>__{hartley}
<D>__{but dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{how long has dolores been driving that bus, mr. otto? how many times has she steered clear of danger? what went wrong that morning?}
<A>__{mitchell takes the cup of tea.}
<C>__{mitchell }
<D>__{someone calculated ahead of time what it would cost to sacrifice safety. it's the darkest, most cynical thing to imagine, but it's absolutely true. and now, it's up to me to make them build that bus with an extra bolt, or add an extra yard of guard rail. it's the only way we can ensure moral responsibility in this society. by what i do.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{so you're just the thing we need.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{isn't that what you want us to believe? that we're completely defenseless? that you know what's best?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{listen to me, mrs otto. listen very carefully. i do know what's best. as we're sitting here the town or the school board or the manufacturer of that bus are lining up a battery of their own lawyers to negotiate with people as grief stricken as yourselves. and this makes me very, very mad. it's why i came all the way up here. if everyone had done their job with integrity your son would be alive this morning and safely in school. i promise you that i will pursue and reveal who it was that did not do their job.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{who is responsible for this tragedy. then, in your name and the walkers' name and the name of whoever decides to join us, i shall sue. i shall sue for negligence until they bleed.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{i want that person to go to jail. for the rest of his life. i want him to die there. i don't want his money.}
<A>__{mitchell nods sympathetically.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{it's unlikely that anyone will go to prison, mrs. otto. but he or his company will pay in other ways. and we must make them pay. not for the money or to compensate you for the loss of your son. that can't be done. but to protect other innocent children. you see, i'm not just here to speak for your anger, but for the future as well.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what we're talking about is an ongoing relationship to time.}
<A>__{pause. hartley looks at mitchell's teacup.}
<C>__{hartley}
<D>__{i didn't ask if you wanted milk.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{no. a little sugar though.}
<C>__{hartley}
<D>__{we've only got honey.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{i will...take it straight.}
<A>__{mitchell maintains his eye contact with wanda.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{are you expensive?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{if you agree to have me represent you in this suit, i will require no payment until after the case is won, when i will require one third of the awarded amount. if there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing. it's a standard agreement.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{do you have this agreement with you?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{it's in my car.}
<A>__{mitchell gets up.}
<C>__{mitchell }
<D>__{i will just be a minute. anyhow, you should discuss this all without me before you make any decision.}
<A>__{mitchell moves to the door.}
