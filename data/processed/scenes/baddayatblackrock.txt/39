<L>__{exterior hotel}
<A>__{macreedy is about to go up the steps when he sees coley's car at the curb. both right fenders are creased. an ugly, jagged break has split the front bumper almost in half, one part angling crazily toward the sky, the other drooping in the dust of the road. smith and coley come out of the hotel. they stand on the porch, watching macreedy as he in turn watches the car. they exchange a glance. smith nods, so...}
<C>__{coley}
<D>__{well, if it's not macreedy the world's champion road hog.}
<A>__{he walks down the steps to the street, joining macreedy. smith remains on the porch.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{yeah. it's a small world.}
<C>__{coley}
<D>__{but such an unfriendly one. now why did you want to crowd me off the road?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(with a slow grin)}
<D>__{i'm kind of sorry if i've incurred your displeasure.}
<C>__{coley}
<D>__{look what you did to my car.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{if there's anything i can do to make up for it...}
<C>__{coley}
<D>__{you ought to be careful, man all that one arm driving.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{i'd be glad to pay the damages.}
<C>__{coley}
<D>__{it's a threat to life and limb.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{fortunately no one was hurt.}
<C>__{coley}
<D>__{you could get yourself killed that way nosin' all over the countryside.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{that's the real danger, i can see that.}
<C>__{coley}
<D>__{why that's pretty smart of you. how long you intend to keep it up?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{i'm getting out of here, right now.}
<A>__{he walks up the steps, past smith, and into the hotel. coley glances up at smith, grinning with self satisfaction, like a small boy who has carried out perfectly the instructions of his teacher.}
