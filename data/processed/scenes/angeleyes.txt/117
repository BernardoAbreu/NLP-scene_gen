<A>__{the music continues over sharon driving to the church, parking, taking a deep breath, exiting the car. there is no one else outside the church. the ceremony has already begun. she's planned it that way. she enters the church as the music fades out.}
<L>__{interior church day}
<A>__{as sharon comes in quietly. the church is not full, but perhaps 50 people sit in the front pews, watching the ceremony at the altar: the priest, mr. and mrs. pogue, altar boys. sharon moves forward and slips into a pew a few back from the altar. the slight disturbance of people sliding over to let her in causes a few people to glance over. one of them is kathy. they trade a brief, nervous nod. then kathy whispers to her husband...}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{she came.}
<A>__{we see larry grow tense and angry.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{don't say anything. think of your parents.}
<A>__{larry doesn't look at sharon. the little boy, looking fine in a tiny suit and tie, and being bored, leans to look at his aunt. sharon and larry, jr. trade a look. she winks, then settles back in her pew, watches.}
<B>__{on altar}
<A>__{we get our first look at sharon's father, carl pogue, 62. standing beside his wife, a rather big, stolid guy, taken with the moment, both he and his wife emotional over this. he wears a hearing aid. the priest is speaking.}
<B>__{on sharon}
<A>__{watching with a mix of feelings as the mass continues and the vows are renewed, the priest reciting the rituals.}
