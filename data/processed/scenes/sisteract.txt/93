<L>__{exterior convent}
<A>__{church services are over, and happy people stream out of the convent, but they don't hurry home. standing in groups, they talk pleasantly and make plans for the day. there is a real sense of neighborhood up and down the block. eddie comes down the steps, glances back at the convent, smiles to himself, then crosses the street to his car.}
<L>__{interior chapel}
<A>__{christy and the choir stare at the collection plate that is filled with money.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{jackpot! two buckets}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{this is so exhilarating! all week long, i can't wait till sunday, when we sing.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{i'd rather sing than do anything!}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{it's better than ice cream.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{it's better than springtime.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{it's better than sex!}
<A>__{everyone looks at christy with astonishment.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(catching herself)}
<D>__{i imagine.}
<A>__{everyone's attention suddenly turns to bishop o'hara as he approaches.}
<C>__{o'hara}
<D>__{better and better, sisters, you are truly an inspiration. and i bear gladsome tidings.}
<A>__{the choir gathers around o'hara with curiosity.}
<C>__{o'hara}
<D>__{i've kept the cardinal informed of your progress in the neighborhood. he has been most impressed. and he has invited you to attend a special evening mass at st. matthew's cathedral on sunday night1 to sing for the council of cardinals.}
<A>__{the choir reacts with an excited buzz: "the council of cardinals!", "what shall we sing?", etc. mother superior appears, from the center aisle.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{that is indeed glorious news, bishop. we will be honored to appear.}
<C>__{mother superior }
<D>__{and on such an occasion, i feel a completely traditional program will be best.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{the council of cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire catholic church. they command the utmost respect. your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place.}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{but, reverend mother everyone loves our new style.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{it's brought people back to the church.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{isn't that why we were asked to sing for those cardinals?}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{i believe this can be settled by a simple vote.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{a vote?}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{of course. mary clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state. most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole. a membership that, i am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. all those in favor of allowing mary clarence to select a program?}
<A>__{all the nuns look at one another. then, slowly, one by one, they all raise their hands. mother superior is pure steel at this moment; her expression betrays no emotion. christy, on the other hand, is quite confused.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{but... wait a minute...}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{the majority has spoken.}
<C>__{bishop o'hara}
<D>__{reverend mother, as always, you are a true leader. gracious and understanding.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{it will be wonderful, reverend mother. you'll see.}
<C>__{mary lazarus}
<P>__{(gesturing to christy)}
<D>__{she's a pro.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{i am certain the presentation will be a great success. congratulations, mary clarence. and congratulations to you all.}
<A>__{the nuns cheer, and cluster around christy, chattering about the upcoming concert, as mother superior strides off.}
