<L>__{exterior theatre des vampires night}
<A>__{louis, in the street outside, as the door closes behind him.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{i felt a kind of peace at last. i had found the teacher which lestat could never, i knew now, have been. i knew knowledge would never be withheld by armand. it would pass through him as through a pane of glass. and i knew claudia must leave me...}
<L>__{interior hotel suite night}
<A>__{louis enters. there is unfamiliar scent in the air, a doll sitting by the mirror. louis looks in the mirror and sees...}
<B>__{madeleine}
<A>__{the doll maker, resplendent in green taffeta, sitting like a madonna with claudia on her lap. claudia's arms are wound round her neck. the contrast between mortal woman and immortal child is plain.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{madeleine... louis is shy.}
<A>__{madeleine rises and comes towards louis. she draws back the lace fringes round her throat, so he can see the two marks there. she says softly, dreamily.}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{drink.}
<A>__{louis turns away. claudia speaks, icy, from the bed.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{do it louis. because i cannot do it. i haven't the strength. you saw to that when you made me.}
<A>__{louis turns to madeleine.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you haven't the vaguest conception under god of what you ask!}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{au contraire, monsieur, i have.}
<A>__{louis pushes her away. claudia screams.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you have found your new companion, louis! you will make me mine!}
<A>__{louis grips madeleine and shakes her.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{how do we seem to you? do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? drink, you ask me! have you any idea of the thing you will become?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{your evil is that you cannot be evil! and i will suffer for it no longer!}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{don't make me, claudia! i cannot do it!}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{yet you could do it to me! snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy tale! couldn't you have waited? six more years and i would have had that shape! and now you weep! you haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.}
<A>__{she points to madeleine}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you give her to me! do this before you leave me!}
<A>__{she begins to weep, sobbing like a child.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{oh god! i love you still, that's the torment of it. but you know i must leave you louis...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{yes...}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{and who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?}
<A>__{louis looks at madeleine}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you promise to care for her then?}
<C>__{madeleine}

<A>__{she wraps her arms around claudia.}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what do you think she is, madeleine? a doll?}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{a child who can't die...}
<A>__{her finger clutches a locket around her neck, louis touches it, opens it.}
<B>__{the locket}
<A>__{a picture of a young girl, claudia's age, wistful, beautiful.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{and the child who did die?}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{my daughter...}
<A>__{louis takes her chin in his hand, gently.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{look at the gaslight. don't take your eyes off it. you will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. do you hear me?}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{yes!}
<A>__{louis pulls her to him and starts to drink her blood.}
