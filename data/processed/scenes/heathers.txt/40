<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(forced cheerfulness)}
<D>__{hi guys. glad you could make it.}
<A>__{ram smacks his hands together.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{so do we just start fucking?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i've made a circle on each end of the clearing. ram, you come over here.}
<A>__{kurt steps into the scratched in the dirt circle next to him. a confused ram walks past veronica and steps into a circle at the opposite end of the foggy clearing.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{when you get in the circle, strip.}
<A>__{the guys pause, then slowly start taking off their clothes.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{what about you?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i was hoping you'd rip my clothes off me, sport.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{oh. good idea.}
<A>__{kurt and ram awkwardly stand at opposite ends in their undies.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{count of three, guys.}

<A>__{j.d. suddenly moves next to veronica holding a gun in his right hand and the feminine shopping bag in his left.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{three.}
<A>__{j.d. almost non chalantly shoots ram in the forehead. veronica rips out her gun and swings it toward kurt. using both hands, she fires, but misses completely. kurt runs away onto the path. veronica throws down her gun with a smile.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{shucks.}
<A>__{j.d. races to veronica in a white sweat.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{did you miss him completely?}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(giggling)}
<D>__{yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{don't move! i will get him back!}
<A>__{veronica's laughter cuts off like a faucet. suddenly trembling and confused, she watches j.d. bolt into the woods.}
<B>__{the path}
<A>__{a panicked kurt runs on the path through the woods.}
<B>__{off the path}
<A>__{j.d., with a cold efficiency, weaves through trees.}
<B>__{the clearing}
<A>__{veronica turns toward ram's collapsed body.}
<B>__{the path}
<A>__{kurt sees the opening at the end of the woods. j.d. suddenly moves into the light at the end of the woods and raises his gun. kurt runs back the other way with a strangled moan.}
<B>__{the clearing}
<A>__{veronica approaches ram's body with increasing shivers. he does not look bleeding and unconscious. he looks bleeding and dead, dead, dead. kurt barrels into the clearing as j.d. howls from the woods.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{now!}
<A>__{in a burst of frightened, animal instinct, veronica whips around and fires her gun right into kurt's chest.}
<B>__{squad car in school parking lot}
<A>__{two cops, milner and mccord, smoke marijuana in a squad car already filled with smoke. after a coughing fit, milner shouts.}

<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{kurt doesn't look too good.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{remember he's left handed.}
<A>__{a quivering veronica puts the gun in kurt's left hand.}
<C>__{milner }
<D>__{keep going until you hit the clearing!}
<A>__{j.d.'s head snaps forward. he yanks up veronica. they both run into the woods behind ram's body as the two cops charge into the clearing, guns raised. seeing the jocks, they stop.}
<D>__{mccord mother of shit!}
<C>__{milner}
<D>__{call in!}
<A>__{milner looks toward where veronica and j.d. ran out.}
<C>__{milner}
<D>__{i heard something out there. i'm checking it out.}
<A>__{milner runs off as mccord shouts into a walkie talkie. he is holding the pulse of kurt kelly.}
<D>__{mccord this is officer mccord and i've got two dead bodies in the woods behind westerburg high. oh my god, one of them's kurt kelly, the quarterback.}
<B>__{in the woods}
<A>__{veronica and j.d. flow through the trees. an owl hoos.}
<B>__{another part of the woods}
<A>__{milner blindly barrels through the woods.}
<B>__{just outside the woods}
<A>__{veronica and j.d. come out of the woods and start running up a grassy hill toward veronica's car which is parked on top.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{faster!}
<B>__{in the woods}
<A>__{milner is jolted by an owl hoo, then continues moving.}
<B>__{the hill}
<A>__{veronica and j.d. reach the car, panting. milner races out of the woods just as veronica and j.d. slam the car doors closed behind them. milner huffs up the hill.}
<B>__{the sawyer car}
<A>__{veronica and j.d. somersault into the backseat and begin taking off their clothes.}
<B>__{the hill}
<A>__{milner continues to move up the hill.}
<B>__{the sawyer car}
<A>__{veronica and j.d., stripped down to their underwear, embrace.}
<B>__{outside the car}
<A>__{milner approaches the car and peers in. his crackling walkie talkie startles him.}
<P>__{mccord (o.s. walkie talkie)}
<D>__{milner, can you hear me? what's going down?}
<A>__{milner moves away from the car, then speaks into his walkie talkie.}
<C>__{milner}
<D>__{think what i heard was just a stinking owl. all i got is two kids making out in the backseat of a car. should i pry them apart?}
<P>__{mccord (o.s. walkie talkie)}
<D>__{forget it. i got all the answers back here, partner.}
<B>__{the sawyer car}
<A>__{seeing the cop move away. veronica and j.d. stop kissing. they catch their breath, smile, then continue passionately necking.}
<B>__{the clearing}
<A>__{milner runs back into the clearing.}
<C>__{milner}
<D>__{what's the deal? mccord suicide. double suicide. they shot each other.}
<C>__{milner}
<D>__{that's kurt kelly! mccord yeah, and the linebacker, ram sweeney.}
<C>__{milner}
<D>__{oh my god, suicide? why? mccord does this answer your question?}
<A>__{mccord reaches in the feminine shopping bag and pulls out the bottles of perrier water.}
<C>__{milner}
<D>__{oh man, they were fags ! mccord listen up, "we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world."}
<C>__{milner}
<D>__{ah jesus h. fuck. kurt was a parade magazine honorable mention...}
<A>__{milner shakes his head slowly then suddenly looks up.}
<C>__{milner}
<D>__{wait a second. how did they shoot each other if we heard two separate sets of gunshots? mccord shit, i always hear gunshots when i'm high. life is one crazy bitch. don't try to analyze it. the quarterback buggering the linebacker. what a waste.}
<C>__{milner}
<D>__{oh the humanity.}
