<D>__{great.}
<A>__{jones begins to stomp down the hall, towards the part of the hall that is lit. then pop, that light goes out as well. jones stops. he pulls out his big gun from his armpit holster. he checks over his shoulder, and then with the gun extended he moves slowly forward. he approaches an area that opens up a little. he pauses, then under his breath.}
