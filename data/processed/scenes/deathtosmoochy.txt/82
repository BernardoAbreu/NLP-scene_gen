<L>__{interior spinner dunn's night}
<A>__{spinner's massive arms envelope sheldon in a bear hug, practically lifting him out of his seat. burke, who's having dinner with sheldon, holds onto the table before it gets knocked over.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{easy, spinner. watch the ribs, buddy.}
<C>__{spinner}
<D>__{i missed you so much!}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i missed you too, champ.}
<A>__{he drops sheldon and pulls out his cowbell.}
<C>__{spinner}
<D>__{i've been practicing and practicing and i got real good, sheldon. real good!}
<A>__{he starts banging on it with a butter knife. sheldon cringes.}
<C>__{spinner}
<D>__{wanna see me march?}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{sure, why not.}
<A>__{spinner starts marching through the restaurant, clanging the cowbell. people who are trying to eat their dinner look annoyed. sheldon sits back down at his table.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{so you were saying you had some good news?}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{yes. some very good news. after giving it a lot of thought... i've decided to do the ice show.}
<A>__{burke gleefully slaps sheldon on the shoulder.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{finally! i got me a bar mitzvah boy. today you are a man!}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i realize now it's a sin to waste your power.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{like they say, rock bottom's a college education.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{but here's the really good news: i'm doing it myself. no sponsors, no vendors, no crooks. not one dirty hand will touch this. not one person will make a dollar off these kids. smoochy on ice will be a study in purity.}
<A>__{burke's grin suddenly fades.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{as far as food concessions go, i will supply the refreshments. for free. low sodium, whole wheat pretzels and apple slices. healthy stuff. now are you ready for the best part?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i'm holding my breath.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{all profits from ticket sales will be used to built a state of the art methadone clinic in coney island.}
<A>__{burke looks pale.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i'm not just talking a run of the mill clinic... i'm going to build a methadone palace. a place where men and women can withdraw in luxury.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{sheldon, you can't do an ice show and cut out the vendors. and more importantly, you can't cut out the parade of hope. it's suicide.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{you always told me, when you've got muscles you make the rules. well, i'm feeling pretty strong right now.}
<A>__{sheldon rises and tosses his napkin down.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{all this time i was letting the business use me. well, i think it's time i start using the business. i've got my clout back and i'm not gonna waste it this time. take care of it, burke.}
<A>__{sheldon exits. burke sits there, looking very concerned. on his way out the door, tommy stops sheldon. spinner's cowbell clanging continues.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{shel, you gotta help me out. he bangs that goddamn thing from morning till night. i got a headache that goes from my eyes to my ass.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{whatever i can do, tommy, just say it. you know i love spinner. and i owe you.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{give the boy something else to do on the show. anything. just as long as it don't clang, chime or honk.}
