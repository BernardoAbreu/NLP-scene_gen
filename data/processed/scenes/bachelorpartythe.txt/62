<L>__{interior. greenwich village duplex apartment}
<A>__{this is one of those duplex apartments on west tenth street which consists of one huge living room that is two stories high and you need a little rolling stepladder to reach the books on the upper shelves of the built in bookcases. there is a little wrought iron stairway that leads to the second floor, which consists of two tiny little bedrooms. apartments like these, as is the case in this one, are usually lived in by two girls, one of whom is a secretary in an advertising agency and the other a model for a garment manufacturing firm. both girls are in their early thirties and are milling about somewhere in the mass of people in the living room, carrying drinks, laughing up a storm, pausing at the little knots of discussion groups with an apt phrase. they rather think of themselves as madame de staels with their own salon of bright young people, for most of the men and women at the party are in some way connected with the arts, probably in an avant garde way. it is a little difficult to tell this by looking at them because avant garde artists have become obsessed with dressing like businessmen, but if you can hear the talk as we can, you get the point fast enough. we pick up phrases like: "i really find it difficult to think of tennessee williams as a serious artist," or "my teacher thinks all tenors are frogs except gigli," or "i don't see how you can say that; his designs fairly throb with sex." there are, as eddie predicted, a number of people sitting on the floor, mostly girls, circled in the swirl of their ann fogarty dresses, and there is one obvious ballerina, with her black hair pulled tightly back into a severe pony tail, using the wrought iron railing that separates the dropped living room from the small entrance foyer to demonstrate something about positions at the dancing bar. there is someone at the piano banging away, shouting his songs, but he is completely inaudible five feet away. a few people lean over the piano, apparently exhilarated by the songs. thin blankets of smoke wreathe their way up to the two story high ceiling. we catch some more phrases: "i thought truman capote was supposed to be here." "truman's in russia, i think." "good heavens, what can the russians want with truman capote?" "oh, i never read anything published in this country." "oh, i mean, the paper bound paris edition." in short, this is a real chi chi wingding where all the furniture is too low, and the hostess is very proud of the fact that her end table is made out of an orange crate. somewhere, through the jumble of the party, we can hear the doorbell chime. a young woman, at one of the little knots of people, perks her ears and says:}
<C>__{hostess}
<D>__{i'm sure that's the police again.}
<A>__{she's very proud of this. she turns and weaves her way through the crowded room, carrying her drink. she goes up the step to the entrance foyer, turns to her left, picks her way over two middle aged men who are both throwing a pitch at a fairly tight girl of eighteen, past the kitchen, which is a bedlam of ice cubes and kitchen towels and which is occupied at the moment by two intense women in their late thirties wrapped in deep discussion, up past two young men who have no immediate use for girls, to the front door of the apartment. she opens the door. group shot of eddie, arnold, and charlie from the hostess's point of view. not exactly a heartening sight to most hostesses, three fairly loaded young men with their collars unbuttoned and their ties limp and dangling.}
<C>__{hostess}
<P>__{(beaming)}
<D>__{are you coming to complain about the noise?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{do we look like complainers?}
<C>__{hostess}
<D>__{i don't know who you are, but come in, come in. i don't know half the people who are here tonight.}
<A>__{they enter a little warily and ill at ease, peering into the jammed room.}
<C>__{hostess}
<D>__{the police have been here twice. the first fellow was just adorable. we gave him a drink, and he's upstairs in a bedroom now, for all i know.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{is that right?}
<C>__{hostess}
<D>__{if you want something to drink, you'll just have to go into the kitchen and get it yourself. the place is just mad. do you write, paint or sing?}
<A>__{eddie spreads his arms in all inclusive expansiveness.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{everything.}
<A>__{but the hostess has already bent to chat with two women, one old, one young, sitting on the floor. our three cavaliers look at each other and then look out over the wild, jumbled room.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{boy, do you get invited to a party like this or do you get committed?}
<A>__{a passing young man who overhears this, pokes his head into the group and says to charlie with a flashing smile:}
<C>__{young chap}
<D>__{i heard that. it's awfully funny.}
<A>__{charlie regards the smiling young chap.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{beat it.}
<A>__{the chap's smile flashes off and he scurries away. eddie rubs his palms and surveys the women in the crowded room with a measuring eye.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{this is going to be like shooting ducks. pick out your duck, men.}
<A>__{wetting his lips, he starts out for some girl he has decided on across the room.}
