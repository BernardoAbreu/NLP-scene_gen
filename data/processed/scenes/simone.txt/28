<L>__{interior viktor's soundstage day}
<A>__{the cavernous soundstage is almost completely empty save for a small table upon which sits two computer keyboards and a tablet attached to a large, projection screen monitor and two side monitors. viktor takes a seat in front of the monitor.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(to himself as he inserts his hollywood hard drive simulation one)}
<D>__{pay no attention to the man behind the computer.}
<A>__{a title appears on his computer screen. welcome to}
<B>__{simulation one}
<A>__{with a satisfied smile, viktor backspaces characters until he revises the title to: welcome to}
<B>__{simone}
<A>__{he presses "enter" and a face begins to build wire upon wire, pixel upon pixel until a completed synthespian emerges simone. she is indistinguishable from a flesh and blood actress. simone moves on a video loop against a neutral background titled "visual loop 6". within the confines of the monitor she is reminiscent of a beautiful caged animal. she looks a little bored as if she has been cooped up in cyberspace for too long.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(to the screen)}
<D>__{good morning, simone. simone viktor good morning, mr. taransky.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{a star is... simone viktor ... digitized.}
<A>__{only now do we observe that viktor is occasionally talking into a microphone connected to the computer and pressing a key on his keyboard. when he speaks, she speaks. simone's voice and mouth movements automatically sync in response to viktor's voice. a scanning light on viktor allows simone to mimic his movements.}
<D>__{simone viktor you mean they buy it?}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(nervous smile as he}
<D>__{examines his first}
<P>__{royalty check)}
<D>__{buy it? they're paying for it. and around here that's how you really know they buy it.}
<A>__{viktor fondly touches a photograph of hank that is taped to the terminal from the "l.a. times" obituaries.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{i'm only sorry hank isn't here to see this.}
<A>__{viktor looks up, simone mimicking his action.}
<D>__{simone viktor}
<P>__{(depressing the button}
<D>__{every time he wants to express his thoughts}
<P>__{through simone)}
<D>__{maybe he can.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{do you have any idea what this means, simone? our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it. simone viktor}
<P>__{(appearing to indulge viktor with a smile)}
<D>__{i am the death of real.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(pondering the enormity of the hoax)}
<D>__{you are birth of... what? a phenomenon. a miracle. a new era in show business. all i wanted to do was finish the film. simone viktor and now look what you've started. and now look what you've started. and now look what you've started.}
<A>__{viktor's conversation with himself is not merely for his own amusement. he is adjusting and refining simone's voice.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{hmm... a little less streep, a little more bacall.}
<A>__{viktor scrolls through a photo library of stars, living and dead, that comprise simone. viktor makes an adjustment on a panel on the computer screen dedicated to simone's audio, incorporating the vocal deliveries "20% streep, 80% bacall". he speaks once again as simone to test the adjustment. the voice patterns appear on his screen graphic representations of the sound waves.}
<D>__{simone viktor is that better, mr. taransky?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{yes. yes, it is.}
<A>__{viktor snaps back to reality himself. he scrolls through the list of screen legends. he clicks on the image of audrey}
<B>__{hepburn.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{while i think of it, i'd like you to add something to your repertoire remember that thing hepburn does in "breakfast at tiffany's".}
<A>__{a clip of audrey hepburn in "breakfast at tiffany's" plays on the screen. hepburn, sitting on a fire escape, looks up.}
<C>__{audrey hepburn}
<P>__{(from the screen, an incomparable smile)}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(pausing the moment)}
<D>__{let's hear you say "hi" like audrey.}
<A>__{with a cut : and paste, viktor morphs the gesture seamlessly into a frozen simone. viktor presses play.}
<C>__{simone}
<P>__{(imitating audrey's performance perfectly)}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{perfect.}
<P>__{(stretching)}
<D>__{god, i'm so relaxed around you. simone viktor you did create me.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{no. i... just helped bring someone else's dream to life. simone viktor mr. taransky, we both know i was nothing without you. i was computer code ones and zeros.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{you're right. you're right. of course, one doesn't want to boast. it's a classic case of technology in search of an artist. that's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.}
<A>__{viktor gets up and starts walking around the room, warming to his theme. simone moves in a visual loop on the monitor, nodding attentively as if she's really interested.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{see beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. see that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.}
<P>__{(voice raising in excitement)}
<D>__{ see that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real. once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway. only the spirit, the illusion remains. besides, what's real anymore? these days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area. simone viktor}
<P>__{(simone appears to look directly at her maker)}
<D>__{are you ever going to tell the truth about me, mr. taransky?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{the only real truth is in the work. simone viktor you know what i'm talking about.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{yes. yes, i'm going to tell the truth about you, why wouldn't i...?}
<P>__{(pondering his own question)}
<D>__{of course, with hank's tragic passing, the secret died with him.}
<P>__{(shaking the thought from his head)}
<D>__{i am going to tell the truth... after your next picture.}
<A>__{feeling uneasy at the prospect, viktor changes the subject. he pulls out his script for "eternity forever".}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{speaking of which this is the project i'd like you to do nexterior simone viktor not, "eternity forever"? the legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made? i'd kill for that part.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{i was hoping you'd say that.}
<A>__{suddenly, simone appears to talk on her own.}
<C>__{simone}
<D>__{i will do anything to please you, mr. taransky.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(pretending to be hard of hearing)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i didn't catch that. what did you say?}
<C>__{simone}
<D>__{i will do anything to please you, mr. taransky.}
<A>__{on a side monitor, we discover a highlighted box marked "pre record" viktor's finger on the "play" button. he is unable to resist speaking another line.}
<D>__{simone viktor and i will never, ever leave you.}
<A>__{simone appears to indulge viktor by blowing him a kiss until we see that viktor has now highlighted a box marked, "gestures of affection wink, smile, giggle, sigh, kiss, flutter of eyes, flick of hair, puff of chest". viktor comes close to the monitor. he notices something about simone's face.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{you're so beautiful. too beautiful.}
<A>__{viktor accesses a program labeled, "distinguishing features". he adds a "freckle" and a "mole". from a distance we watch him, alone with simone in the vast, empty soundstage.}
