<L>__{exterior cimmerian village day}
<A>__{corin walks out of the forge, looking around for conan. various other cimmerians go about the daily routine, but conan is nowhere to be seen.}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{conan?}
<A>__{corin looks to the ridge above the village, noticing a thick fog creeping in. the fog curls and eddies, something is out there. suddenly, lucius and his legion of silver armored warriors burst out of the fog, attacking with speed and strength. but the cimmerians are hardly caught flat footed. in seconds they are armed, and they counter the charge with a furious charge of their own. slam! sword and bone collide as the two enemy fronts smash into each other. and the battle devolves into one on ones where the barbarians have the upper hand. uran and corin lead the main push of battle frenzied barbarians as they swing their huge broadswords, extending their reach advantage over the aquilonian's shorter weapons. and quickly, the aquilonian's numbers are cut in half. corin squares off against lucius himself. lucius is sweating. worried. it wasn't supposed to be this hard.}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{retreat!}
<A>__{as a unit, the aquilonians race back into the woods. in seconds, the cimmerians give chase in wild pursuit.}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{wait! hold your ground!}
<A>__{but it's too late, nearly half the cimmerian warriors are gone on the chase.}
