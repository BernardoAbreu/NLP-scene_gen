<L>__{exterior new orleans street night}
<A>__{cars rushing by, twentieth century madness. louis emerges from the theatre, walks through the streets.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{i had returned to new orleans. as soon as i smelt the air, i knew i was home. there was sadness there, rich, almost sweet, like the fragrance of jasmine. i walked the streets, savoring it like a long lost perfume...}
<L>__{exterior garden district night}
<A>__{louis walks past the many greek revival mansions.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{and then on prytania street, only blocks from the lafayette cemetery i caught the scent of death and it wasn't coming from the graves...}
<A>__{camera pans over white walled lafayette cemetery and its surrounding mansions.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{the scent grew stronger as i walked. old death. a scent too faint for mortals to detect.}
<A>__{louis sees rats darting across the street. they rush into a great overgrown garden surrounding a ruined mansion. no lights. louis stops at a rusted gate. he forces it open and enters }
<B>__{a veritable jungle}
<A>__{of overgrown rose and oak tree and wisteria. he sees a faint glimmer of light coming from a distant glass window of a huge greek revival house. he approaches then he sees }
<B>__{old shrivelled corpse}
<A>__{of a man, long dead and dried up, snagged in the thorny rosevines.}
<B>__{louis}
<A>__{looks around. walks on. sees another corpse, almost nothing but bones, sinking into the wet earth, the roots of an oak overgrowing it. he looks up at the distant light. he passes a third corpse, caught in wisteria and rose vine, only bones and clothes.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{they were like the doomed princess caught in the thorny vines of sleeping beauty's castle. i knew what it meant. a vampire had lured them here, but had been to weak to get rid of them.}
<A>__{louis sees dead rats lying near the steps.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{it spelt weakness, madness, the behavior of a dying animal that pollutes its own lair.}
<A>__{louis treads carefully on the rotted steps. he moves along the porch. more dead rats. he sees through the floor length window into rooms lined with stacked books. virtually walled with them. water seeps down from the ceiling, gleaming as it streaks over the books. the floors of the splendid rooms are bare, except for a rotten french chair by a dead fireplace. a single mirror reflecting the moon. dead rats. he moves along the porch to the parlor windows. the candle flickers inside. he sees }
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{lestat lying on the floor. he is gaunt to near starvation. all his scars are gone, but he is almost a skeleton and his eyes are enormous in their sockets. his clothes are rags. blond hair beautiful, as always. malloy's entrances face superimposed over}
<C>__{malloy }
<D>__{lestat escaped the fire!}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{he hadn't even been there. and all those years i thought he was dead.}
<B>__{back to lestat}
<A>__{one tiny candle stands beside him. he reads an early comic, from the turn of the century. without turning his head, he speaks.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{i'm so glad you're here louis... i've dreamed of your coming...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{don't try to speak... it's alright...}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{i didn't mean to let them do it... that santiago, he tricked me...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{that's all past, lestat.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{yes. past... she should never have been one of us...}
<A>__{he turns and looks at louis. old, fearful, broken.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{still beautiful louis. you always were the strong one.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{don't fear me, lestat. i bring you no harm.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you've come back to me, louis? you've come again to me?}
<A>__{louis shakes his head. a series of police sirens go by, piercing the night sky. a helicopter goes overhead. red flashes illuminate his face. lestat shivers, covers his ears. he's terrified. louis touches him, calming him, until the lights pass over.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{it's only a siren...}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{i can't bear it louis! the machines out there, that fly and that roar! and such lights! they make the night brighter than the day!}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{and they frighten you?}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you know i love the dark. but there's no dark anymore.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{it's false light, lestat. it can't harm you...}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{if you stayed with me louis, i could venture out... little by little... become the old lestat.}
<A>__{louis shivers. he releases him.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i have to go now lestat...}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you remember how i was, louis.. the vampire lestat...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{yes. i remember...}
<A>__{lestat shivers.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{i tried to tell you louis... that night in paris... when i first came to you... no one can refuse the dark gift, louis... not even you.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i tried...}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{and the more you tried, the more i wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. and how you suffered... i need your forgiveness, louis.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you have it...}
<A>__{louis walks slowly away from him. lestat turns back to his candle, his magazine.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you'll come back, louis... take me out... little by little... and maybe i will be myself again...}
<A>__{a bluebottle buzzes by him. his hand shoots out and grabs it, squeezes the blood.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{yes, lestat...}
<B>__{on louis}
<A>__{as he walks through the decayed house. his eyes are expressionless.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{and my story ends there. but in fact it ended a long time ago, with claudia's ashes in that theatre. my love died with her. i never really changed after that. what became of lestat i have no idea. i go on, night after night. i feed on those who cross my path. but all my passion went with her yellow hair. i ma a spirit with preternatural flesh. detached. unchangeable. empty.}
