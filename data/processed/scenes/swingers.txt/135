<D>__{what else...? let's see... you have complete freedom.}
<C>__{brunette}
<D>__{to do what?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i don't know.... to grow, to go out. whatever you want.}
<C>__{brunette}
<D>__{anything?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{anything.}
<C>__{brunette}
<D>__{like if i meet a handsome young man and i wanted to ask him to dance? i can do that?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{uh, if the guy wants to.}
<C>__{brunette}
<D>__{you don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{yes. i mean, no. i mean, maybe he would find her, i mean you attractive. maybe he doesn't like to dance. maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...}

<A>__{she's in great shape, and look how classy her vintage dress looks. a vision from the forties. she's too good for this place. she belongs on the nose of a b 52. what can he say, but...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{sure i will.}
<A>__{he awkwardly leads her to the unusually empty dance floor. they start to dance. it's a slow song and they boringly rock back and forth. mike is self conscious, but her touch. oh her touch.}
