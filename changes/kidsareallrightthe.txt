<LOC>__{INT. STATION WAGON - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The family drives home. Jules is at the wheel. Nic's in the passenger seat, eyes red and puffy. Laser's in the back. No one speaks, everyone's lost in their own worlds.   Finally Laser breaks the spell.}
<CHAR>__{LASER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't think you guys should break up.}
<ACTION>__{A long beat.}
<CHAR>__{NIC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No?   Why's that?}
<CHAR>__{LASER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I think you're too old.}
<ACTION>__{Both Nic and Jules crack smiles. Their son's rudeness is unsurpassed. But then his words have an unexpected gravity.}
<CHAR>__{NIC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thanks, Laser.}
<ACTION>__{Jules, disarmed and slightly smiling, reaches over and puts her hand on Nic's leg. She gives it a gentle squeeze and doesn't let go. Nic looks over to Jules, finally disarmed. Nic reaches for Jules' hand and holds it tight.   Nic and Jules look at each other, and then away. Laser watches his moms holding hands from the back seat. Their small gesture is what he needed. He smiles to himself, grateful for a sign.}
