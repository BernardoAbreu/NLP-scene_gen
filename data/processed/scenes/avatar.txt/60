<A>__{close on grace's blue hand gently brushing away soil, exposing a tangle of root tendrils.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{see, right here where the roots of the two trees interact.}
<A>__{wider grace and norm crouch among enormous octopoidal roots. she takes a tiny sample using a needle like probe. norm uses a digital device to scan the roots. jake, bored, scouts ahead a few meters. he comes to a glade filled with shoulder high spiral plants called helicoradians. he brushes one and shtoonk! it sucks down into a tube in the ground so quickly it seems to simply vanish. curious, jake touches another shtoonk! and another like popping balloons after a party. shtoonk! shtoonk! shtoonk! a chain reaction begins and the whole colony pulls down into the ground, revealing a hammerhead titanothere. like a six legged rhinoceros, but twice that size. its massive, low slung head has projections of bone giving it the look of a hammerhead shark. its baleful eyes lock onto him. jake raises his rifle. grace, alerted by the creature's snorts, runs to where she can see the tableau. she presses her throat mike.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{don't shoot. you'll piss it off.}
<A>__{the bull hammerhead bellows and lowers its 3 meter wide sledgehammer of a skull.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{it's already pissed off!}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{jake, that armor's too thick. trust me.}
<A>__{jake starts to back away. the hammerhead bellows again, pawing the earth.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it's a territorial threat display. do not run, or he'll charge.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{what do i do?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{hold your ground!}
<A>__{the hammerhead slashes its head sideways, splintering saplings. it bellows again, lowers its head and charges jake screams at the top of his lungs, spreads his arms wide and runs straight at the thing. it stops abruptly, with an oversized bleat. on jake amazed the gambit worked.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{oh yeah! who's bad?! that's right.}
<A>__{something rises up behind him out of focus a thanator. the most awesome land predator the universe has ever conceived this thing could eat a t rex and have the alien for desert. it is a black six limbed panther from hell, with an armored head and massive distensible jaws. jake, unaware of the advancing thanator, is still bracing the hammerhead }
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{that's what i'm talkin' about, bitch!}
<A>__{the bull wheels around, trumpeting in fear, and crashes away through splintering undergrowth.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{that's right motherf }
<A>__{a guttural snarl behind him. jake spins in time to see three tons of rippling thanator launch over him, landing between him and the hammerhead. the ground shakes. the thanator emits an earsplitting roar, enraged that the hammerhead got away. it twists on itself, turning to face jake, and bares its fangs with a lethal hiss.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{what about this one? run, don't run? what?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{run. definitely run!}
<A>__{jake bolts as the thanator leaps after him and jake launches himself between two large trunks, forcing the beast to claw its way around to the side while jake scrambles up around over a tangle of roots and sk rash!! claws slash the air behind him, exploding bark off a trunk as jake wills himself forward in a frenzy. with rippling muscle the beast is airborne again, blacking out the sun but jake dives under a massive root system, and crash! kindling rains around him as the beast tears into the root trunks above him. claws slash down next to him as he rolls and crawls glistening jaws smash and snap against the barrier trunks, sending chunks of wood flying. it's spittle sprays across jake, jaws inches away as he rolls onto his back, and fires his ar point blank but the rifle is snatched out of his hands. the beast screeches an ungodly wail of pain and rage and rips the entire trunk away. jake scrambles to escape but glistening jaws lunge downward, snap shut and the creature rips jake out of the tree, shaking him like a junkyard dog with a rabbit, only it has him by the backpack, so jake unlatches it and he flies free as the thanator crushes the pack with its teeth. giving jake a moment to sprint away, but with a hideous bellow the thanator crashes after him, splintering trees. jake runs in a blur, dodging between trunks as a glistening black tornado shreds the forest behind him and he sees water ahead and dives outward with all his might the thanator's jaws snap shut inches behind him as he flies out into open space and jake splashes down into a swiftly moving river. the thanator leaps down after him, pursuing from rock to rock, its claws swiping like a grizzly fishing for salmon. jake ducks under as fwhoosh! black claws slash past his face amid turbulent bubbles. a waterfall ahead. jake is swept over the falls, with the thanator swiping at him from a rock, just missing and jake disappears down the throat of the thundering cataract.}
