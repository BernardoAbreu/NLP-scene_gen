<L>__{exterior main street night}
<A>__{sarah sprints down the main street as fast as she can, toward the building on which sits the helicopter. above her, she can see nick has now reached the helicopter and is waving to her. sarah reaches the fallen water tower, which is next to the helicopter building, and starts to climb it. elsewhere in the street, kelly is still covering underneath the fallen shed. in the distance, she can see the helicopter. but she is trembling with fear, unable to move. the whole shed suddenly rattles as something heavy hits it outside. kelly's mouth drops open to scream, but her terror is so complex that no sound comes out. she raises her hands in self defense, whatever's outside roars with effort, the entire shed is suddenly ripped right up off of her, and she looks up into her father's eyes.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{dad!}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{he grabs her by the hand and they take off down the street. on the rooftop, sarah emerges at the top of the water tower structure and leaps onto the roof, into nick's arms.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{where's kelly?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{where's ian?}
<A>__{eyes wide with panic, they both turn and look down at the street below, where they see kelly and malcolm, racing at top speed down the middle of the street with a velociraptor chasing them. down in the street, malcolm and kelly have a twenty yard advantage on the animal. they're pretty fast, but it's faster. above them, nick and sarah are at the edge of the roof, shouting and urging them on. they push it, faster. they reach the base of the fallen water tower, the jumble of struts and metal poles that sarah climbed.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{climb!}
<A>__{kelly leaps ahead of him and grabs hold of one of the poles, pulling herself neatly up to her feet and reaching for the next one. malcolm stretches and makes the same effort, but for him it's much harder. below them, the raptor springs and slams into the struts, shaking the whole structure. it pulls itself up. higher up, kelly climbs fast, hands gliding over the poles. she breaks out into the open, where a long, narrow pole runs on a slight incline up to the roof. she scampers across it, running the balance beam. she reaches the other side, on a ledge below the roofline, and looks back. malcolm is at the other end, hesitating, drained, breathing hard.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{dad, come on!}
<A>__{below him, the raptor closes in. malcolm sets out across the beam, his legs shaking. he places his feet carefully, he doesn't have nearly the balance kelly did. the raptor draws closer.}
<C>__{kelly }
<D>__{faster!}
<A>__{malcolm slips. one foot twists right off the bar and he spins, arms flailing, trying to regain his tenuous balance. but he overcompensates and his whole body, wrenches out from under him. he falls, the bar smacks him hard in the chest, knocking the wind out of him, and he drops, flipping right off the bar and bouncing painfully through the maze of bars below. he drops right past the pursuing velociraptor, crunching to a halt in a nest of bars ten feet off the ground, probably cracking a rib. kelly screams from above him.}
<C>__{kelly }
<D>__{dad!}
<A>__{she stares down in horror at her father. wrenched in among the bars, malcolm is helpless as the animal crouches only six feet above him now, with an open attack route. the animal snarks and goes into its pre attack crouch. up above, kelly wipes the palms of her hands on her jeans and leaps out into space, grabbing hold of one of the bars. the raptor springs. kelly spins around, over the top of the bar, and, at the very peak of her trajectory, she lets go. the raptor sails through down from above, feet first, slamming both of them squarely into the raptor's side, sending it hurtling into space. she lands hard and awkwardly, clanging into the spidery scaffolding next to malcolm as the raptor smashes to the ground below. but kelly manages to hold on.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{get up!}
<A>__{she grabs hold of malcolm and pulls him to his feet. on the roof, kelly and malcolm appear over the roofline. the pilots shouts from inside.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{let's go let's go let's go!!}
<A>__{malcolm and kelly scramble toward the helicopter. but at the opposite side of the roof, a raptor claws its way over the edge as well. malcolm sees it and they lunge for the helicopter, but the animal is far faster. it's only ten feet away, then five, they're surely done for this time, when ka boom! there comes the loudest single gunshot anyone has ever heard, and the raptor flies off its feet and lands ten feet across the roof, dead. they look up, to the source of the gunshot. it's roland, standing at the edge of the roof, holding his smoking .600 nitro express. but there's no time for celebration, as suddenly the helicopter's left skid cracks right through the surface of the roof.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{hurry! the roof's giving way!}
<A>__{the skid dips even further, ripping right through the thatch and wood construction. kelly, who had one foot in the helicopter, loses her balance as the roof caves in beneath her.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{kelly!}
<A>__{she falls, screaming, through the hole and down, into the building below. one floor down, kelly lands with a crunch on the floor immediately below the roof, about nine feet down. but her landing is cushioned by an inordinate amount of straw and leaves that have been arranged there. she lifts one hand, and a yellowy, viscous substance drips off of it. it's yolk. she looks around, noticing half a dozen large, oblong shapes. eggs. above her, malcolm is scrambling, climbing down to her through the wreckage of the creaking, crumbling roof.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{kelly! i'm coming!}
<A>__{kelly climbs to her knees, but behind her, a large, dark shape is moving. rising. unfolding, in a way. it's a pteranodon. yep, flying dinosaur. the enormous animal raises its head, a brilliant blue crest extending two feet behind its long, saber like beak. it squawks at kelly in fury. she can only stare, spellbound. malcolm reaches her and grabs hold as the angry animal unfurls its massive twenty two foot wingspread. on the roof, the helicopter lurches as it sinks further into the crumbling roof, and now the skids are getting tangled in the debris. roland races over to the hole, climbs in a few feet, and starts kicking at it, making it larger.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{give me a ladder!}
<A>__{in the pteranodon nest, malcolm tries to haul kelly back up the way he came, but a second pteranodon now appears from the depths of the building, screeching in fury at these invaders who have landed in the middle of their clutch of eggs. an emergency rescue ladder drops through the hole in the roof. malcolm grabs kelly with one arm and the ladder with the other and they start to climb out of the nest. on the roof, malcolm and kelly climb the ladder and are pulled into the belly of the chopper just as two enormous beaks break through the surface of the roof around them. the pteranodons are emerging.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{go go go go gog go!}
<A>__{the helicopter lurches up a few feet, but it yanked to an abrupt stop. the engines whine, the chopper just hovers there.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{we're snagged on something!}
<A>__{they loos down. both pteranodons have come out through the hole in the roof and are clinging to the skids of the helicopter. they flap their gigantic wings in unison, and drag the helicopter off, into the air, away from the nest and let go. freed, the helicopter gains altitude quickly. in the helicopter, the pilots gape as the pteranodons coast along, right next to the helicopter.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{hang on! if i tip it hard, i can cut 'em with the rotors!}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{no! don't! they're not attacking!}
<A>__{they look out the windows, where, indeed, the magnificent animals are merely accompanying them, flying escort as the chopper gains altitude.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{they're protecting their nest. that's all. that's all they're doing.}
<A>__{kelly, completely drained, sits between sarah and malcolm, each of whom has a protective arm around her. she sags against her father's chest, nothing left. he holds her tight and whispers in her ear.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{thank you. kelly, thank god. thank god for you...}
<A>__{in the night sky, over the island, the helicopter steadily gains altitude. a hundred feet. three hundred. a thousand. as the helicopter is clearly leaving the island, the pteranodons now peel off, their job done. one of them banks sharply, right in front of the moon. the moonlight silhouettes it, shining right through its membranous wings, lighting it up like a halloween skeleton. below, the tiny green island melts away into the vastness of the wine dark sea.}
