<D>__{we see brian as we hear vernon in the hall.}
<C>__{vernon }
<D>__{god damnit! he opens the door and storms in.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{why is that door closed? for a few seconds no one says anything, they just stare at vernon.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{why is that door closed?}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{how're we s'posed to know? we're not s'posed to move, right? vernon turns to claire.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{we were just sitting here, like we were s'posed to... vernon looks around and looks at bender.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{who closed that door?}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{i think a screw fell out of it...}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{it just closed, sir... vernon looks at allison in the back.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{who? allison lets out a squeak and slams her face onto the table, hiding in her jacket hood.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{she doesn't talk, sir...}
<C>__{vernon}
<P>__{(to bender)}
<D>__{give me that screw...}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{i don't have it...}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{you want me to yank you outta that seat and shake it out of you?}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{i don't have it...screws fall out all of the time, the world's an imperfect place...}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{give it to me, bender...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{excuse me, sir, why would anybody want to steal a screw?}
<C>__{vernon}
<P>__{(to claire)}
<D>__{watch it, young lady... vernon goes over to the door. he tries to hold it open by putting a folding chair in front of it.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{the door's way too heavy, sir. the door slams shut despite the chair.}
<C>__{vernon }
<D>__{god damnit! they laugh. vernon opens the door again. he comes back in.}
<C>__{vernon}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{andrew clark...get up here. come on, front and center, let's go. andrew gets up and walks over to vernon.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{hey, how come andrew gets to get up? if he gets up, we'll all get up, it'll be anarchy! vernon and andrew are now attempting to move the steel magazine rack in front of the door.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{okay, now, watch the magazines!}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{it's out of my hands... they get it into the doorway and it blocks the entire door.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{that's very clever sir, but what if there's a fire? i think violating fire codes and endangering the lives of children would be unwise at this juncture in your career, sir. vernon thinks about it. he turns to andrew.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{alright, what are you doing with this? get this outta here for god's sake! what's the matter with you? come on!}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{you know the school comes equipped with fire exits at either end of the library. brian points at them and bender glares at him.}
<C>__{bender}
<P>__{(to brian)}
<D>__{show dick some respect! andrew and vernon come back into the main section of the library.}
<C>__{vernon}
<P>__{(to andrew)}
<D>__{let's go...go! get back into your seat. andrew sits.}
<C>__{vernon}
<P>__{(to andrew)}
<D>__{i expected a little more from a varsity letterman!}
<P>__{(to bender)}
<D>__{you're not fooling anybody, bender! the next screw that falls out is gonna be you! vernon turns to leave.}
<C>__{bender}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{eat my shorts... vernon spins in his tracks and faces bender again.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{bender}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{eat my shorts!}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{you just bought yourself another saturday, mister!}
<C>__{bender}

<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{you just bought one more right there!}
<C>__{bender}

<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{good! 'cause it's gonna be filled, we'll keep goin'! you want another one? say the word, just say the word! instead of going to prison, you'll come here! are you through.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{i'm doing society a favor!}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{that's another one, right now! i've got you for the rest of your natural born life if you don't watch your step! you want another one?}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{you got it! you got another one, right there! that's another one pal!}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{cut it out! claire mouths the word "stop" to bender.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{you through?}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{not even close, bud!}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{good! you got one more, right there!}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{do you really think i give a shit?}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{another... bender glares at him.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{you through?}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{how many is that?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{that's seven including the one when we first came in and you asked mr. vernon here whether barry manilow knew that he raided his closet.}
<C>__{vernon}
<P>__{(to bender)}
<D>__{now it's eight...}
<P>__{(to brian)}
<D>__{you stay out of it!}
<C>__{brian}

<D>__{you're mine bender...for two months i gotcha! i gotcha!}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{what can i say? i'm thrilled!}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{oh, i'm sure that's exactly what you want these people to believe. you know something, bender? you ought to spend a little more time trying to do something with yourself and a little less time trying to impress people. you might be better off.}
<P>__{(to everyone)}
<D>__{alright, that's it! i'm going to be right outside those doors. the next time i hafta come in here...i'm cracking skulls! (bender mouths im}
<P>__{cracking skulls)}
<D>__{vernon leaves and closes the door. a musical riff builds to a climax as bender screams.}
<C>__{bender}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{fuck you! we see the clock, it reads a quarter to eight. we see bender, lighting his shoe on fire and lighting a cigarette with his shoe. we see claire thinking. we see brian playing with his balls. we see andrew playing with his sweatshirt. we see allison pulling a string around her finger and making it turn purple. we see bender put the flames on his shoe out. he then plays air guitar. we see allison drawing. we see andrew playing paper football. he cheers silently. allison shakes dandruff from her hair onto her picture. we see everyone fall asleep.}
