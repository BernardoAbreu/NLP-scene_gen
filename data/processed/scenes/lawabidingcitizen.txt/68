<L>__{interior nick's house night}
<A>__{late. nick, in t shirt and pajama bottoms, comes up a dark hallway with a file in his hand, rubbing his eyes. he comes to his daughter's bedroom door, quietly turns the knob... emma's bedroom ...and finds the bed empty. sheets thrown back. nick stands for a moment, every irrational fear he's ever had washing over him. camera follows him fast down the hallway... ...into the master bedroom, where he finds emma sleeping with kell. he stands for a moment, heart hammering. softly:}
