<L>__{exterior station. day}
<A>__{the station is in the middle of a moor. there appears to be no habitation around. in the distance are some hills. the train stands at the station. as it pulls away, renton, spud, tommy and sick boy are left standing on the platform, looking around.}
<C>__{sick boy}
<D>__{now what?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{we go for a walk.}
<C>__{spud}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{a walk.}
<C>__{spud}
<D>__{but where?}
<A>__{tommy points vaguely across the moor.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{there.}
<C>__{sick boy}
<D>__{are you serious?}
<A>__{they step across the tracks toward the vast moorland. they stop. all but tommy sit down on rocks or clumps of heather.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{well, what are you waiting for?}
<C>__{spud}
<D>__{i don't know, tommy. i don't know if it's... normal.}
<A>__{a group of three serious walkers trudge past from the other end of the platform, decked out in regulation berghaus from head to foot. they tramp off towards the wilderness. the boys watch them go. spud opens a can.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{it's the great outdoors.}
<C>__{sick boy}
<D>__{it's really nice, tommy. can we go home now?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{it's fresh air.}
<C>__{sick boy}
<D>__{look, tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{doesn't it make you proud to be scottish?}
<C>__{renton}
<D>__{i hate being scottish. we're the lowest of the fucking low, the scum of the earth, the most wretched, servile, miserable, pathetic trash that was ever shat into civilization. some people hate the english, but i don't. they're just wankers. we, on the other hand, are colonized by wankers. we can't even pick a decent culture to be colonized by. we are ruled by effete arseholes. it's a shite state of affairs and all the fresh air in the world will not make any fucking difference.}
<A>__{the three serious walkers are receding into the distance. the boys troop back towards the platform.}
<P>__{(v.o)}
<A>__{at or around this time, we made a healthy, informed, democratic decision to get}
<D>__{back on drugs as soon as possible. it took about twelve hours.}
