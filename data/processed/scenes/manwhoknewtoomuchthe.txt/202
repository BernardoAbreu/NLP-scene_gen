<D>__{gulliver 6198. thank you.}
<A>__{he waits and at that moment there is a sudden, loud, but happy pounding on the door. both jo and ben jump and turn toward the door, almost frightened. muffled shouts are heard of "open up! we know you're in there! jo! it's us! we're here!"}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{i go.}
<A>__{she heads for the door, and ben sits there squirming with suspense, and annoyance at being interrupted. beyond him, jo opens the door, and immediately four people pour in. they are val parnall and his wife. helen, intelligent, sophisticated, and full of life. the other two are cindy fontaine, an american music hall entertainer, now in england, around forty five, more of a character actress than a lead and jan peterson, a musical comedy singer nearer jo's age, smart looking, but talkative and slightly scatterbrained. the women come in first, helen parnell throws her arms around jo in affectionate greeting.}

<C>__{jo}
<D>__{hello, val. jo and i want to thank all of you for the lovely flowers. but you shouldn't have. we might not be here long!}
<A>__{ben has been watching them anxiously, torn between hanging up the phone, or waiting for his call to go through. the call finally comes through.}
