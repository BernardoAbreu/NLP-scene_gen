<D>__{karen bursts through the screen door, rushes down the steps to steve's waiting ferrari, it's lights already on, engine running. throws her suitcase in the back. barb steps out onto the porch as it reverses, slams into gear and accelerates down the drive, spewing gravel as it goes. bill comes out, watches it disappear with barbara. then:}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i'm taking jean with me, heading back to colorado in the morning. but barb's still focused on the distant ferrari.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{she's too much for you right now.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i'm sure you'll find a way to blame me for all this.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{yeah, well...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i can't make it up to jean right now. she's just going to have to wait until i get back to boulder.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you and jean have about forty years left to fight and make up.}
<C>__{barbara}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{why, what happens in forty years?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you die.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{oh, right.}
<C>__{bill}

<C>__{bill}
<D>__{no, you don't.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i've physically attacked mom and jean in the span of twenty four hours. you stick around here and i will cut off your penis.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{that's not funny. he starts back inside.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{you're never coming back to me, are you, bill?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{never say never, but...}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{but no.}
<C>__{bill}

<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{cindy.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{right. even if things don't work out.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{and i'm never really going to understand why, am i? bill struggles... seems he might have more to say, but then:}
