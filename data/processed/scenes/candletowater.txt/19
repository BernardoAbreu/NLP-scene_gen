<L>__{1.11 exterior playground day}
<A>__{vaughn sits on a bench and waits. he pulls his coat around him against the biting cold. he checks his mobile again. nothing. the unthinkable crosses his face. surely not. but then brooke (38) walks across the playground toward him. she sees him, hurries. it takes him a moment to recognise her. that troubles him. he smiles at her his first smile in a long time. her smile speaks of very real joy after very real pain. he stands in order to greet her. she tries not to cry, but it's impossible. she embraces and kisses him passionately. she looks at him like he's all she ever wanted. he sees disguised scars on her face. the scars of pain in her eyes.}
