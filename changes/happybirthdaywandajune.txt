<ACTION_ALT>__{SCENE ONE}
<ACTION>__{SILENCE.  Pitch blackness.  Animal eyes begin to glow in the darkness.  Sounds of the jungle climax in animals fighting. A SINGER is heard singing the first bars of "All God's Chillun Got Shoes."  HAROLD, LOOSELEAF, PENELOPE, and WOODLY stand in a row in the darkness, facing the audience.  They are motionless.  A city skyline in the early evening materializes outside the windows. The lights come up on the living room of a rich man's apartment, which is densely furnished with trophies of hunts and wars.  There is a front door, a door to the master bedroom suite, and a corridor leading to other bedrooms, the kitchen and so on.}

We got some guys up here who got shoved in them lakes.  They dissolved.}

<DIAL>__{Harold Ryan stopped talking German to me there in Yugoslavia.  He switched to English, so I finally got some kind of idea what he was so burned up about.  He wanted revenge for the guy we killed with orange juice.  I don't know how he ever found out about it.  There was just three of us there when we did it--me and two regular military doctors.  Somebody who cleaned up afterwards must have squealed.  If I'd lived through the war, and they tried me for war crimes and all that, I'd have to tell the court, I guess, "I was only following orders, as a good soldier should. Hitler told me to kill this guy with orange juice."}

He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo."
