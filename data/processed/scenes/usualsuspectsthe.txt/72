<D>__{i came clean. i told it like it happened on the boat. so what if i left out how i got there? it's got so many holes in it, the d.a. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. so you got what you wanted out of me. big fucking deal.}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{and this is why you never told the d.a.}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{you tell me, agent kujan. if i told you the loch ness monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{turn state's evidence. take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{i've got immunity now. what can you possibly offer me?}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{if there is a keyser soze he'll be looking for you.}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{where's your head, agent kujan? where do you think the pressure's coming from? keyser soze or whatever you want to call him knows where i am right now. he's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. immunity was just to deal with you assholes. i got a whole new problem when i post bail.}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{so why play into his hands? we can protect you.}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{gee, thanks, dave. bang up job so far. extortion, coercion. you'll pardon me if i ask you to kiss my pucker. the same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me they'll bail me out? fuck you. you think you can catch keyser soze? you think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out? if he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{after that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again.}
