<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{video camera's p.o.v. we see lots of hallways, doorways and security locks, all from the pov of a man's hip. the footage is from the camera in the switched briefcase that corwin is now carrying with him. charlie's angels 8 18 99 we pull back from the video to see we are actually watching it...}
<L>__{interior charles townsend agency day}
<A>__{... on the big screen. the angels and bosley watch the footage, along with knox and vivian wu. vivian has seated herself close to natalie. so close, in fact, that natalie keeps having to shift a few inches. dylan, meanwhile, sits across the room from knox, deliberately avoiding eye contact. on the big screen: as the videocamera passes a room marked with an intimidating warning sign...}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{there!}
<B>__{video freezes.}
<C>__{knox }
<D>__{that's the room with the mainframe. everything at red star goes through that system.}
<C>__{charlie's voice}
<D>__{so if we want to find proof that red star stole knox's technology, that's the computer to tap.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{exactly. but they have heavy firewalls and encryption. you can't jack in from outside. you'll have to physically be in that room to get at the data.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{even if we do get inside, there won't be time to search for it. there's got to be a hundred terabytes of information there. it could take days.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{so you install a transmitter.}
<A>__{all eyes go over to natalie.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{patch in directly to the relay, broadcast on a high frequency. that way, you can have access to the mainframe from the comfort of your own home. and they have no idea that you can peek inside.}
<A>__{charlie's angels 8 18 99 knox is impressed. the other angels nod. it's a good idea.}
<C>__{vivian wu}
<D>__{that's all fine in theory. but you still have to get inside that room to install it. what about security?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{red star has a lot of government contracts, so security is tight. key card badges throughout. redundant security at all red line areas with biometric scanners and weekly keycodes. pervasive video surveillance, lasers, air displacement sensors. plus a hard wired fail safe at the relay to prevent exactly this kind of tapping.}
<C>__{vivian wu}
<D>__{it sounds impossible.}
<A>__{alex checks with her fellow angels. they're in agreement.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{it sounds like fun.}
<A>__{with a subtle rush, we move into a stylized montage that shows how they do it. it features whip pans, freeze frames and zooms to show us only the highlights.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{only the two directors can disengage the fail safe. we have to get their keys.}
