<L>__{exterior hunting shack valley pass sunset}
<A>__{the hunting shack huddled against the south side of a low rise. beyond the rise, a pass. but there's no negotiating it now. it's completely snowed in. and another storm is on the way.}
<L>__{interior hunting shack day}
<A>__{wind howling in the b.g. the postman lies back on his cot. the little shack has been scoured clean. abby stares listlessly at the fire. the silence is torture. the postman tries to strike up a conversation.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{wind's come up.}
<P>__{(no response from abby)}
<D>__{getting colder too. must be another storm }
<A>__{abby gets up and throws a log on the fire.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{anything else?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i didn't mean for you to }
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{your legs are going to rot off if you don't try to walk.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i'm hurt.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you're lazy.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{lazy?! i got a hole in my stomach. i'm weak. the two big meals around here are grass and snow. and we're running out of grass.}
<A>__{as the two of them glare at each other for a moment. abby starts to put on her coat.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<A>__{abby doesn't answer. she picks up the rifle and starts to lead the horse outside.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{you're not leaving me here, are you?}
<A>__{abby is out the door without a word.}
