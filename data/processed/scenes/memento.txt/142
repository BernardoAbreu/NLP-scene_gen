<A>__{the car alarm of the jaguar is sounding. leonard exits, walks to the car and gets in, switching off the alarm.}
<C>__{teddy }
<D>__{you should lock a car as nice as this.}
<A>__{teddy is in the passenger seat. leonard, startled, grabs him by the throat.}
<C>__{leonard}

<P>__{(gasping)}

<P>__{(gasping)}
<D>__{sammy. remember sammy. you told me about sammy.}
<A>__{leonard lets him go.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{what are you doing in my car?}
<A>__{teddy is now wearing his big grin, rubbing his neck.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{sense of humour went with the memory, huh? you know why you're still here, don't you?}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{unfinished business.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. your business here is very much finished. you're still here because of natalie.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{who's she?}
<A>__{teddy chuckles.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{whose house do you think you just walked out of?}
<A>__{leonard looks at the house. teddy motions towards leonard's pockets.}
<C>__{teddy }
<D>__{take a look at your pictures, i bet you got one of her.}
<A>__{leonard pulls out his polaroids and flips through them. he pauses at the one of natalie. teddy swipes it out of his hands to get a better look at the blurred image of natalie turning in a doorway.}
<C>__{teddy }
<D>__{great shot, lenny.}
<A>__{teddy flips the photo over. there is nothing on the back. teddy hands it back to leonard.}
<C>__{teddy }
<D>__{you wanna make a note that you can't trust her.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{why's that?}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. she's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake.}
<C>__{teddy }
<D>__{you can't stay with her. let me give you the name of a motel.}
<A>__{teddy starts looking for a piece of paper.}
<C>__{teddy }
<D>__{good thing i found you. she's bad news.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{what do you mean "bad news"?}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{she's involved with these drug dealers.}
<A>__{teddy opens the glove compartment, finding a stack of beer mats from a local bar called ferdy's.}
<C>__{teddy }
<D>__{see these? that's the bar where she works. her boyfriend's a drug dealer. she'd take orders for him, arrange meets. he'd write messages on these, then leave it on the bar. she'd drop replies when she served him drinks.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{why should i care?}
<A>__{teddy starts writing on the beer mat.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{she's gonna use you. to protect herself.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{from who?}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{guys who'll come after her. guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. they'll want to make somebody pay. maybe she'll try and make it you.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. is that it? you worried she'll use me against you?}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{she couldn't.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{why not?}
<A>__{memento blue revisions 8 27 99}
<C>__{teddy}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{she has no idea who i am.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{why are you following me?}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{i'm trying to help you. i knew she'd get her claws into you. she doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. why would i lie? do not go back to her. take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.}
<A>__{leonard takes out his pen, places the picture of natalie face down on the dash and writes on the white strip on the back: "don't trust her"}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{happy now?}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{i won't be happy until you leave town.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{how long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{what sort of questions?}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{the sort of questions you should be asking yourself.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{like how'd you get this car? that suit?}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{i have money.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{from what?}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{my wife's death. i used to work in insurance, we were well covered.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{so in your grief you wandered into a jaguar dealership?}
<A>__{leonard says nothing. teddy laughs.}
<C>__{teddy }
<D>__{you haven't got a clue, have you? you don't even know who you are?}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{yes, i do. i don't have amnesia. i remember everything about myself up until the incident. i'm leonard shelby, i'm from san fran }
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{that's who you were, lenny. you don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. you're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.}
<A>__{teddy reaches out to leonard's lapel, and gently opens his jacket to reveal the label.}
<C>__{teddy }
<D>__{put it this way. were you wearing designer suits when you sold insurance?}
<A>__{leonard looks down at his suit, then back to teddy.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{i didn't sell }
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{i know, you investigated. maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{yeah, well, thanks for the advice.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{don't go back in there. there's a motel out of town.}
<A>__{memento blue revisions 8 27 99 teddy hands leonard the beer mat and gets out of the car.}
<C>__{teddy }
<D>__{it's been fun, lenny.}
<A>__{teddy walks off. leonard pulls his polaroids out of his pocket and finds the one of teddy. he places it on the dash, face up, next to the one of natalie which is still face down on the dash. leonard reads the message he has written on the back of natalie's picture: "don't trust her" he flips teddy's picture over, like a croupier turning a card at blackjack. on the back it says: "don't believe his lies" leonard purses his lips in surprised frustration. he grabs his pen and scribbles on the back of natalie's picture, obliterating the words: "don't trust her" he flips natalie's picture over and considers her blurred image. he looks up at her house, then picks up the beer mat, reading the address teddy has given him.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{fuck it. i need my own place.}
<A>__{leonard starts the engine.}
