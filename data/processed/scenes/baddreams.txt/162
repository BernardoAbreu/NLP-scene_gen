<A>__{wasserman walks along, accompanied by a uniformed officer. they go into }
<L>__{interior berrisford's hospital room day}
<A>__{where the doctor is in a bed, one leg and one arm in traction. he's talking to his lawyer as the police officers enter.}
<C>__{lawyer}
<P>__{(in mid speech)}
<D>__{ letters of support could have an influence on the court... you know, from your peers ?}
<C>__{berrisford}
<P>__{(cutting him off)}
<D>__{i have no peers.}
<P>__{(turning)}
<D>__{hello, lieutenant.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{forgive me for not getting up.}
<C>__{wasserman}
<D>__{real funny, doctor. try this for laughs: as soon as you're ambulatory, you're going in front of a grand jury, and you're going to be charged with six counts of obstruction of justice and two counts of assault.}
<C>__{wasserman}
<D>__{then it gets choice: five counts of murder in the first degree, one count of murder in the second degree. add the civil liability to all that, and you're going to have plenty of time to write that book.}
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{well. i don't agree with your definition of justice, but i suppose i obstructed it... all in the name of science, of course }

<P>__{(appalled)}
<D>__{doctor berrisford }
<C>__{berrisford}
<P>__{(hushing him)}
<D>__{ but as to murder, well, lieutenant, i beg to differ. i didn't kill anyone. why would i? i'm only interested in knowledge. cynthia is a unique girl the product of an environment and a philosophy unrivaled in its purity. i wanted to understand the depth of her commitment, the link between psychosis and total immersion philosophies, the dark terra incognita of the human psyche }
<C>__{wasserman}
<P>__{(fed up)}
<D>__{hey, go chow on a latin dictionary, okay? you can bullshit all you want, but how do you account for six bodies?}
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{clearly some unknown variable was a factor.}
<C>__{wasserman}
<D>__{yeah? well, if you didn't kill off the therapy group, who did?}
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{lieutenant, i will put it in terms even a policeman can understand.}
<A>__{he smiles, shrugs the best he can in his plaster cast.}
<C>__{berrisford }
<D>__{it beats the fuck out of me.}
