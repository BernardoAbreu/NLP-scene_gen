<L>__{exterior prison cemetery day}
<A>__{a handful of people are gathered in an open field under a fierce mississippi sun. a couple of young inmates, jake and leon, lean on their shovels. they are waiting to bury two identical caskets with inmate numbers stenciled on the pinewood lids. a guard rests the butt of his rifle on the ground and takes a long, healthy pull from his canteen. he offers it to the prison chaplain, who is much obliged. superintendent bill burke, a 40 year old black man, glances at his watch and loosens his tie. sure is hot. mary humphries, an elderly white woman in a nurse's uniform, stands behind willie long, an ancient inmate sleeping peacefully in a wheelchair. she readjusts an umbrella to shield the old black man from the blistering sun. burke dabs his forehead with a handkerchief. he gives the nod to the chaplain, who steps forward and cracks his bible. the men remove their hats.}
<C>__{chaplain}
<D>__{in accordance with the regulations of the state of mississippi, we gather here today to lay to rest the remains of inmates r. gibson, number 4316, and c. banks, number 4317. ashes to ashes, dust to dust. may god have mercy on their souls.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{go ahead, fellas.}
<A>__{the young inmates plunge their shovels into the dirt. one by one, the mourners head back toward a prison van parked on a nearby dirt road.}
<C>__{nurse humphries}
<D>__{i will come back for you in a little while, willie...}
<A>__{she leaves willie alone with jake and leon. he rolls his chair up to the edge of the graves and gazes at the pinewood caskets.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{these two guys friends of yours, old man?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{we spent some time together.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{why do i get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{1932? that's like, that's like...}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{sixty five years ago. they always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. looks like you're finally free, boys.}
<A>__{willie pulls a bottle of moonshine from his jacket and takes a swig in their honor.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{hey, the dude's holdin'.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{come on, old timer, hook the brothers up.}
<A>__{willie passes the bottle to leon, who takes a swig and winces from the unexpected kick.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{hell of a way to get out. heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. them fellas sizzled up good. looked like some shit from the x files.}
<P>__{(taking a swig from the bottle)}
<D>__{damn, that shit's nasty.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{ray's special recipe. he always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{what were they, bootleggers?}
<A>__{willie holds up the bottle, checking the clarity of the liquor.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{something like that.}
<T>__{match cut to:}
<L>__{exterior spanky's back alley (1932) night}
<A>__{ray gibson holds up a similar bottle of liquor to a light over a door. music comes from within. he takes a swig and stashes the bottle in his belt. he adjusts his tie, polishes his shoes on the back of his pants and raps on the door.}
<L>__{interior spanky's night}
<A>__{the speakeasy is jumping, jammed with people. up on stage a hot jazz band is playing backup for a seductive chanteuse. well heeled patrons enter through doors near the stage. in the back, at the end of a long hallway, a bouncer cracks open the door and ray squeezes inside.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{oh, no, ray. not tonight. spanky's not happy with you.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{is spanky here?}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{no, but...}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{then what's the problem?}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{but this is where the action is and i have to be where the action is. look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't i come through for you? ain't she stepping in style now?}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{well, alright then. what do you think about this new tie?}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{sharp.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i look good tonight. and i feel lucky, too.}
<A>__{ray heads inside.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{anyone asks, it wasn't me who let you in.}
<A>__{ray slides through the crowd, pausing at the bar to nibble on the neck of a cocktail waitress.}
<C>__{cocktail waitress}
<D>__{don't even try it.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{when do you get off?}
<C>__{cocktail waitress}
<D>__{i get off at two, but you ain't never getting off.}
<A>__{she carries a tray of drinks into the crowd. ray shakes his head in wonderment at her departing form. the barkeep steps up as ray pulls out his bottle.}
<C>__{barkeep}
<D>__{you can't drink that in here, ray.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i sure can't drink that watered down swill you're serving. give me a glass of ice.}
<C>__{barkeep}
<D>__{i can't give you a glass of ice. i can't give you anything until you pay your damn tab.}
<A>__{disregarding the warning, ray tilts the bottle back. shaking his head, the barkeep moves on to a paying customer. ray's eyes follow a bottle of french champagne as it is delivered to a nearby table. here sits the straight laced claude banks with his girlfriend, daisy. she's enjoying the show. he's polishing the silverware. the waiter pours two glasses of champagne and leaves the bottle on ice. claude regards his glass skeptically.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{for the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{claude. here's to your new job down at the bank. i always knew you'd make something of yourself.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{know what i'm going to buy with my first pay check?}
<A>__{daisy thinks she does. she leans in, eyes twinkling.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{season tickets to the yankees. right there on the first base line.}
<P>__{(off her disappointment)}
<D>__{what's wrong, baby?}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{i was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, claude.}
<A>__{french champagne shoots out of claude's nose.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{engagement ring!}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{that's what respectable folks do. get a job, get married, start having babies. that's what you want, isn't it?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{sure it is. i just don't see any reason to rush into things. damn, look at this shirt. i will be right back.}
<A>__{claude leans in to kiss daisy on the lips. she offers her cheek. he departs.}
<B>__{over by the bar}
<A>__{ray watches claude make a beeline for the men's room.}
<L>__{interior men's room night}
<A>__{claude steps into the bathroom and approaches the sink. a big hand falls on his shoulder and yanks him backwards into a stall...}
<L>__{interior stall night}
<A>__{claude is shoved down on the toilet by two bag men in suits. suddenly, it's crowded in here.}
<D>__{bag man #1 congratulations, claude. we understand you finally got yourself a job. bag man #2 guess that means you can pay mr. riley the fifty bucks you owe him.}
<A>__{they rifle through claude's jacket and quickly find his wallet.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{now wait a second, guys. i've got a bill to pay out there. bag man #1 twenty two dollars. not bad for a start.}
<A>__{they toss back his empty wallet.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{come on, fellas, that's two weeks pay. i'm here with my girl. you gotta leave me something. bag man #2 how about your legs?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{my legs? those are good, i will keep the legs...}
<A>__{the stall door swings shut as the bag men depart.}
<L>__{interior spanky's night}
<A>__{on his way into the men's room, ray squeezes past the bag men on their way out.}
<L>__{interior men's room night}
<A>__{glancing around, ray spots claude's feet under the stall door. he steps up to the sink, washes his hands and takes a towel from the attendant. scanning the assortment of grooming products, he selects a bottle of cologne and takes a sniff.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(displeased)}
<D>__{you have any of that french stuff?}
<A>__{as the attendent bends down to retrieve a bottle of the good stuff, ray palms a coin from the tip basket.}
<C>__{attendent}
<D>__{here you go.}
<A>__{ray offers the quarter, a gesture of uncommon generosity.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{keep the change.}
<C>__{attendent}
<D>__{why, thank you, sir!}
<A>__{ray pats the cologne on his face. a toilet flushes and claude steps over to the sink. ray catches his eye in the mirror.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{don't i know you?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{sure i do. what's your name again?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{claude banks.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{claude banks. how could i forget that? you've got to remember me. ray gibson. we went to high school together.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{you went to monroe?}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(beaming)}
<D>__{that's right! good old monroe...}
<A>__{ray throws his arms around claude, deftly snatching his wallet. claude extracts himself from ray's embrace.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{well, i went to jefferson, so you must have a different claude banks in mind.}
<A>__{claude straightens his jacket and heads for the door. ray stashes the stolen wallet in his jacket.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{sorry, man. my mistake.}
<L>__{interior spanky's night}
<A>__{on the stage, the chanteuse has downshifted into a sultry number about back door lovers and broken dreams. ray steps out of the men's room and is instantly collared by bullethead, a man who makes his living being large and threatening.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{watch the threads, bullethead. if this is about my tab, i've got it covered.}
<A>__{pressed up against the wall, ray reaches into his jacket and produces claude's wallet. bullethead snatches it, inspects it and is not impressed.}
<C>__{bullethead}
<D>__{this ain't about your tab, ray. you've got bigger problems than that.}
<A>__{he stuffs the wallet back into ray's jacket and hustles ray out the back door past the bouncer who let him in.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{is that ray gibson? who the hell let him in here?}
<A>__{back at claude's table claude returns to the table where daisy is sipping champagne. he takes the glass out of her hand.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{come on, honey, let's get out of here.}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{but i'm having a good time...}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{excuse me, sir, i believe you forgot this.}
<A>__{the waiter presents claude with the bill.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{the bill. of course, the bill. we couldn't leave without paying the bill. especially such an incredibly large bill.}
<L>__{interior van night}
<A>__{claude is shoved into the back of the van and the doors are slammed behind him. he bangs and shouts, but it's no use.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{save your energy, claude. you're gonna need it.}
<A>__{ray is stretched out against the back wall. claude is knocked to the floor as the van lurches into motion.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{here, this belongs to you.}
<P>__{(tossing claude his wallet)}
<D>__{it was empty when i found it.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{good old monroe.}
<A>__{ray swigs from his bottle and offers it to claude, who isn't interested.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what i want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when i caught up with you in the johnny?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i don't see where that's any of your business.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{did those two muscle heads shake you down? swear i've seen them down at the track with sure shot riley. that's it, ain't it? a gambling debt.}
<A>__{busted, claude snatches the bottle and carefully wipes off the neck before tilting it high. ray gets a good chuckle out of this straight cat in the bow tie.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{where they taking us, anyway?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{probably to spanky's headquarters down at the pier.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{good, i'm looking forward to meeting this spanky. give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i can't wait to see that. you slay me, man.}
<L>__{exterior pier night}
<A>__{the van pulls into a the loading bay of a warehouse at the end of a short pier on the harlem river.}
<L>__{interior warehouse night}
<A>__{bullethead and a henchman pull ray and claude from the back of the van. they find themselves in a dark warehouse filled with crates of contraband.}
<C>__{claude}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{what are they gonna do to us?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you? dine and ditch, right?}
<P>__{(claude nods)}
<D>__{over ten bucks?}
<P>__{(he nods again)}
<D>__{you're probably looking at a thumb.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{a thumb? what do you mean, like cut it off? for ten bucks?}
<P>__{(ray nods)}
<D>__{that include the tip?}
<A>__{claude shoves his hands under his armpits at the sound of approaching footsteps echoing across the vast space. claude and ray peer into the darkness.}
<C>__{spanky}
<P>__{(from the darkness)}
<D>__{you picked the wrong night to fuck with me, ray. i just lost three men and a truck full of canadian whiskey. you know what that kind of thing does to my business? it makes me want to lash out and hurt somebody.}
<A>__{spanky johnson emerges into the light. he uses a small silver spoon to take an ample snort of cocaine into each nostril. he glances at claude.}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{who's he? friend of yours, ray?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i never saw this man before tonight. he's a lowlife degenerate who lurks in bathrooms. i'm a professional man, an upstanding citizen. i go to church on sunday.}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{then what are you doing here?}
<C>__{bullethead}
<D>__{failure to pay.}
<C>__{claude}
<P>__{(rattled)}
<D>__{look, mr. johnson, you seem like a reasonable man. i got a good job starts monday. i will pay you back with my first pay check. with interest. i don't want to tell you how to conduct your business, but if you cut off my finger you won't get jack. working an adding machine, i gotta be whole.}
<P>__{(his fingers dancing over imaginary keys)}
<D>__{i need my thumbs and all my fingers for praying and doing good...}
<A>__{spanky holds up a hand, silencing claude.}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{the choirboy wants to keep his fingers. who am i to argue? drop him.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{drop him? what does drop him mean?}
<A>__{claude protests loudly as bullethead and the henchman bind his hands and feet. spanky turns to ray.}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{you gotta lotta balls showing your face around my club. if a man's gonna run numbers on my side of broadway, you think he'd have the common sense to keep a low profile. but not ray gibson.}
<A>__{the goons hoist claude up on another pulley and dangle him head first over a hole in the floor. several feet down, the harlem river laps against the wooden pylons.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{no, not down there! that water's filthy! help me out here, man!}
<A>__{shrugging, ray pinches his nose and puffs out his cheeks. the goons release the rope and claude plunges into the water. spanky turns back to ray.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you don't have to drown that fella, spanky. you already scared him half to death. he didn't know who he was fucking with.}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{but you do. what does that say about you, ray? what does that say about me? i've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. but he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so i guess i'm gonna have to school you myself.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{come on, spank, i'm just trying to get by here. you remember how it was when you were starting out.}
<A>__{the henchman yanks on the rope. claude emerges from the hole, gasping for breath.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i was supposed to wear this suit on monday!}
<A>__{the henchman releases the rope, sending claude back into the water. ray reaches into his jacket. bullethead pulls a gun and presses it into ray's temple. ray gives him a look and cautiously pulls out his bottle.}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{what's that, some of your bathtub brew?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{puerto rican rum. see for yourself.}
<A>__{ray tosses him the bottle. spanky uncorks, sniffs, samples the goods. he's impressed.}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{where'd you get this?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{comes up the mississippi. i can get more. a lot more. i was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, i'd be willing to take on a partner.}
<A>__{once again, the henchman yanks on the rope and claude comes up sucking air desperately. he releases the rope, submerging claude for a third time.}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{i'm interested. keep talking.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{all i need is the front money and a truck. i could be back in two, three days tops if i had somebody to share the driving.}
<A>__{spanky considers the terms. can he afford to trust ray? can he afford not to?}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{if you fuck me on this one, i will spare no expense.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{understood.}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{alright, ray, you've got a deal. pick your man and get going.}
<A>__{ray glances around. the pulley rope is still twitching in the water.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i will take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{if i was you, i'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i just want somebody who won't put a bullet in my back once the truck is full.}
<A>__{spanky sees ray's pointerior he nods to the henchman, who hoists claude's limp body out of the water and onto the cement. spanky plants a foot on claude's chest and applies pressure. a geyser of harlem river water shoots from claude's mouth as he sputters back to life.}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{for your sake, i hope you can drive. somebody give him some dry clothes.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{the spinning wheel of a truck}
<A>__{the camera moves up the side of the old ford truck to find claude sitting pensively in the passenger seat.}
<L>__{interior truck (moving) night}
<A>__{ray palms the wheel.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{tell me about that hot sketch you were hypin' last night. she was a choice bit of calico. you two been seeing each other a long time? gonna slap the handcuffs on her and stroll down the aisle one of these days?}
<A>__{tight lipped, claude shifts in his seat.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{sometimes i wish i could find me a sheba to settle down with. suppose i'm just a tomcat by nature.}
<P>__{(trying to fill the silence)}
<D>__{this little rum run is gonna seriously improve my relationship with spanky. he's a good man to have on your side. he's got the capital and the connections. that's what you got to have in that business. spanky's place is pretty plush, but one of these days i'm gonna open up my own establishment. ray's boom boom room. you like that? ray's boom boom room. that's in the groove, don't you think?}
<A>__{if claude does like it, he's not letting on.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{come on, daddy o. you haven't said a word since we started. least you could do is make some friendly conversation.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{look, man, i don't want friendly conversation. i don't want to be your friend. i've seen your friends and i don't like them. i just want to do this thing and get back to new york in time to start my job.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{start your job? what kind of job?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{well, if you must know, bank teller at first federal of manhattan. i'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{that's some long green.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{damn straight, it is. i got my own set of keys because i'm supposed to open up. so if i ain't there 8 a.m. monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay.}
<A>__{beat of silence. ray laughs to himself.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{no, tell me what's so funny.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i don't know. bank teller. sounds like ladies work to me.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{well, maybe i should dig around in other people's clothes for money. it's obviously been highly successful for you.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. get you every time.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i didn't start out to be a bank teller. i was gonna be a ballplayer. even had an offer to play short for the newark eagles.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{why didn't you take it?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{the negro league don't pay so good. and you're always on the road. that don't wash with daisy.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you gave up baseball to be a bank teller? i can't latch on to that.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{at some point a man's got to get serious about his future. i'm sure you have no idea what i'm talking about.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{bank teller's just a start. i got plans. real plans. not opening some zoom boom room. this time next year i will be a loan officer.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{a loan officer?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{that's right, a loan officer.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{so you mean, if i needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, i'd have to hype some square like you?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<A>__{ray pulls out his pocket watch. a mechanical tune plays as he checks the time.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{how would i get a loan, anyway?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{you need collateral.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(re: watch)}
<D>__{like this?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{that thing? who'd you steal it from?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{my daddy gave me this watch.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{yeah? who'd he steal it from?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{my daddy is dead so watch your mouth. you can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. this watch means the world to me. solid gold. keeps perfect time.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{looks like a fake to me. loan denied!}
<A>__{ray stuffs his daddy's watch back in his pocket.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{ah, go chase yourself. i will take my business elsewhere. and for future reference, you are no longer welcome at ray's boom boom room.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{there is no boom boom room.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{when there is, you can forget about it. and i swear to god, you ever talk about my daddy again i'm gonna kick your bank telling, loan denying ass, you got me?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{oooh...}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i think i liked you better when you kept your trap shut.}
<L>__{exterior roadside diner day}
<A>__{the truck veers off the highway and jerks to a halt in front of the rundown establishment.}
<L>__{interior roadside diner day}
<A>__{a dozen white folks look up as ray and claude push through the door.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{man, something smells good in here. how's everybody doing?}
<A>__{nothing but sullen stares from all corners of the room.}
<C>__{claude}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{maybe we oughta find another place.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{are you kidding? tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i must have left my appetite outside, which is where i think we ought to be right now.}
<A>__{claude tugs ray towards the door but ray won't be dissuaded. he boldly addresses a young man in an apron behind the counter.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{good evening, billy. we'd like some coffee and a couple of slices of that homemade pie you've got advertised.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{how you know my name's billy?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{it says so right there on your shirt.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(glancing down)}
<D>__{that what that says?}
<A>__{billy's mama sets a piping hot pie on the back counter and steps up next to her son. she casts a disparaging glance at claude's suit.}
<C>__{mama}
<D>__{if you boys can read so good, how come you missed that sign in the window?}

<D>__{it's alright. you're a free man now.}
<A>__{can't get right steps across the gun line. blocker opens the car door for him. but before he climbs in, can't get right reaches into his pocket and pulls out his rubber ball. with a smile, he tosses it to claude, who snatches it out of the air.}

<D>__{don't worry, we'll take good care of him.}

<D>__{one of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. he said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.}

<P>__{(getting mad)}

<D>__{crop duster.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i ain't getting in no airplane with you. i'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. they threw us in this shithole for life. don't you get it, ray? we're gonna die here! might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.}

<C>__{claude}
<D>__{here's a news flash, ray. we never were friends. we've just been stuck together for 12 years. it's been nothing but bad luck since the moment i ran into you. every time i look at you i get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if i'd never bumped into ray gibson.}

<C>__{pike}
<D>__{if you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.}
<C>__{wilkins}
<D>__{i believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.}
<C>__{pike}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{respect? well, isn't that progressive.}
<C>__{wilkins}
<D>__{if somebody deserves respect, mr. pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.}
<A>__{pike curls his lip with disdain before taking a healthy spoonful of gumbo.}
<L>__{exterior marsh day}
<A>__{claude and ray beat the bullrushes with switches. amid a flutter of wings, three pheasants take to the air. wilkins fires first, knocking one out the sky. pike pulls off two rounds, playing clean up.}

<A>__{ray and claude dump their game bags into the back of a pickup truck. nearby, pike drains his flask while wilkins scrapes mud off his boots. the breeze picks up, clouds fill the sky.}
<C>__{wilkins}
<D>__{well, that's a pretty good haul. what do you say, mr. pike? ready to call it a day?}
<A>__{pike pulls a gold watch from his pocket and releases the face plate. a familiar mechanical tune floats on the gathering breeze. ray turns around slowly. his eyes fall on the watch in pike's hand. his daddy's watch. in pike's hand.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{yeah, it's getting late. i could sure use a bath.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{that's a real nice watch you got there, sir. fancy old thing even plays a little tune.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{yeah, it's special. they don't make 'em like this anymore.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{sure don't. mind if i ask where you got it?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.}
<A>__{claude looks at the watch, then at ray. uh oh.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{must have been some time ago. maybe forty years?}
<C>__{pike}
<P>__{(eyes narrowing)}
<D>__{something like that, yes.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{she give you that scar, too?}
<A>__{pike thrusts the barrel of his gun up under ray's chin.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{i oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{like you shot winston hancock?}
<A>__{wilkins turns to see pike holding ray at gunpointerior}
<C>__{wilkins}
<D>__{what's going on here?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{i'm afraid i'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{that's mr. uppity nigger to you.}
<A>__{ray grabs the barrel of the shotgun and slams it into pike's face. pike rolls over and freezes, staring down the barrel of his own gun now in ray's hands. confused, wilkins points his gun at ray.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{cool it, ray. you're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.}
<C>__{wilkins}
<D>__{he's right, gibson. put down the gun and we'll work this out.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{shoot him, wilkins!}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{don't shoot, sir. i can deal with this.}
<P>__{(cautiously)}
<D>__{ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. see, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. and it's not that i like you or anything, but i've kinda gotten used to having you around.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{he's got my daddy's watch, claude. i always knew whoever took that watch killed winston hancock. and that was you, mr. pike.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{he's crazy. don't listen to him, wilkins.}
<C>__{wilkins}
<D>__{do you realize what your saying, gibson?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{that watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. it meant the world to me.}

<D>__{goddamn it, wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{he shoots me, i swear i will take you with me! i just want to hear you say it.}
<C>__{wilkins}
<D>__{is there any truth to what he's saying, pike?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{what difference does it make? natchez was better off without winston hancock! who cares if a couple of no account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? at least the state of mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{forty years of cheap labor! gimme that gun.}
<A>__{claude grabs for the gun.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{no, i'm gonna kill him }
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{no, believe me, i'm gonna kill him!}
<A>__{claude yanks the gun free and points it right in pike's face. wilkins trains his gun on claude. but the moment passes. claude lowers the gun. bewildered, wilkins does the same.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i can't do it.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{that's because you're soft. gimme the gun.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{what'd you say?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i said you're soft.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{don't call me soft, i hate it when you call me that.}
<A>__{ray mouths the word "soft." claude clenches his jaw, points the gun and pulls the trigger. click. pike smirks and pulls a small gun from his boot. but as he raises it blam! pike is hurled backward by a shotgun blast. shocked, ray and claude look at wilkins, his gun still smoking in his hands. after a significant beat, ray reaches down and gingerly retrieves his daddy's gold pocket watch.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i believe this is mine.}

<C>__{ray}
<D>__{he knows nobody wants to hear the truth.}
<A>__{one of the deputies pats wilkins sympathetically on the back. then he and his partner put away their notebooks and head for their vehicle. wilkins heads up the steps and into the house.}
<C>__{wilkins}
<D>__{well, i think they bought it. one of the deputies belongs to my church.}
<A>__{visibly shaken, wilkins takes a seat, wiping the sweat from his brow with a handkerchief.}
<C>__{wilkins}
<D>__{i realize there's no way... there's nothing i can say to make up for forty years... i will have charlotte prepare those pardon papers right away.}
<A>__{wilkins winces and swallows a couple of pills from his box.}

<L>__{exterior infirmary day}
<A>__{ray and claude, now in their nineties, sit under a tree in the courtyard listening to a yankees game on a transistor radio.}

<D>__{over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery. never thought i'd admit it, claude, but you were right.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{'course i was right. about what?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you're the one who said that boneyard's the only way we're getting out of here. we're gonna join all the rest of 'em soon enough. jangle leg, biscuit, goldmouth, poker face, cookie, radio yes sir, pick a plot and start digging...}
<A>__{ray closes his eyes and settles in for a nap. claude turns to watch jonesy squeaking away. something about what ray just said has given him an idea.}
<L>__{interior infirmary day}
<A>__{"oprah" blares on the television. old convicts linger about in various states of repose and decay. a young orderly pops to the music on his walkman as he pushes a cart through the ward. over at a table, ray and claude play poker with willie, a shaky old junkie and two young gang bangers. the currency on the table isn't poker chips, it's pills of various sizes and colors.}

<D>__{looks like it's up to you, stinky ass sniffer.}
<A>__{glaring, gang banger #2 flips a big pill into the pot.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{thorazine? well, that's a little rich for my blood.}

<D>__{who wants jell o?}
<A>__{the magic word. the poker players join a stampede of oldsters in a clatter of canes, walkers and artificial limbs. ray and claude are left alone at the table.}

<A>__{claude glances around to ensure that he's not overheard.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{you know, ray, i've been chewing on what you said this afternoon. i think i got a plan.}
<A>__{ray gives claude a long look.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{shh! is that so hard to believe?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{don't tell me, i don't want to hear it. it's probably all fucked up, anyway.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{you don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. there's no shame in that.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{it's too late for plans.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{never thought i'd hear ray gibson say that. hell with you then. you'd only slow me down anyway.}
<A>__{ray turns away as claude walks off. a doddering inmate stands nearby slurping on jell o. his robe hangs open.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{hey, man, cover that shit up!}
<A>__{disgusted, ray discards his own jell o. he pulls out his daddy's pocket watch and checks the time. the little mechanical tune nags at him. he snaps the lid shut and considers the watch resting in the palm of his hand.}

<D>__{is everyone here?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{hey, where's claude? i don't see claude!}

<D>__{probably old wires. the place was a tinderbox just waiting to go.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i guess we should have torn this old building down a long time ago.}
<C>__{fire inspector}
<D>__{gibson made it this far before he was probably overcome by smoke. from the look of things, banks never even made it out of bed.}

<D>__{hey, willie, what was claude's plan, anyway?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{nothing to it, really. claude figured they could steal a couple of bodies from the morgue. they got a couple of crackers working there don't know their asses from their elbows. then they was gonna set fire to the infirmary and make it look like those bodies was them that got stuck inside. claude figured during the commotion, it wouldn't be too hard to slip onto one of the fire trucks and hang tight until it rolled right on out of here in the morning.}
