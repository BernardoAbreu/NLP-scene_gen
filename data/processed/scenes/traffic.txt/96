<L>__{interior upstairs hallway night}
<A>__{robert is in the hallway, at caroline's door. he opens it and we get blasted with music. caroline is sitting in a rocking chair with headphones on. she faces the window and moves back and forth, back and forth. robert calls her name, but the soundtrack is drowning him out. he calls again, this time apparently loud enough for her to hear. she takes the headphones off the music stops and turns to look at him. or rather, she looks right through him, as though he didn't exist. robert is so taken aback by the coldness of her gaze that he doesn't speak. she turns away from him and puts the headphones back on.}
