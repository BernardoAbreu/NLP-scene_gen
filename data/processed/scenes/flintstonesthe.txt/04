<L>__{interior flintstones' bedroom day}
<A>__{widen from the windowsill, where a little sea shell hearing aid trumpet amplifies another roostersaurus "cock a doodle doo" into the ear of a "clock radio woodpecker." the woodpecker yawns, gets out of bed, puts a timecard in a little clock. then it turns and begins pecking on a bell, which rings piercingly.}
<L>__{interior bedroom new angle}
<A>__{two shapes are visible under the bedclothes: one is a great snoring bulge, the other is a svelte and lithe shape. as the bell continues ringing, the larger bulge grunts, moans, pulls a pillow over its head, and then finally gropes under the bed for a slipper. the slipper is thrown without aiming }
<B>__{the woodpecker}
<A>__{ducks just in time. it wipes its forehead nervously.}
<C>__{radio woodpecker}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{i hate this job... there's not even a health plan...}
<A>__{he staggers back up to his perch, and then notices for the first time that the dial on the side is pointed not to "alarm" but to "alarm & radio." the woodpecker sighs, looks over at the bed where snoring is still emanating. then the bird swings a little telescope around to point out the window. woodpecker's telescope iris shot as the 'scope pans and focuses, finally settling on a distant stone building marked radio station b rok. perched on top of the wooden radio tower are a monkey and an octopus. the monkey holds up cue cards which the octopus reads, and then waves nautical semaphore flags.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{our woodpecker squints, clears his throat.}
<C>__{radio woodpecker}
<P>__{(deeper "on air" voice)}
<D>__{good morning, bedrock. this is station b r o k with the morning weather and news...}
<B>__{in the bed}
<A>__{the big bulge grunts and mutters a bit, then one hand gropes around, finds the curvaceous form under the neighboring covers... feels it tentatively... then the fingers "walk" upwards...}
<C>__{radio woodpecker }
<D>__{it will be fair and mild through the weekend, continuing for the next eight hundred years, followed by cooling breezes and a protracted ice age...}
<A>__{those walking fingers have reached the top edge of the covers... now they pull them down revealing the owner's face... the face of fred, his eyes at half mast, his face covered in fashionable "bedrock vice" stubble.}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(with genuine charm)}
<D>__{wil ma. wil ma? how about a great big good morning kiss for your freddy weddy?}
<A>__{and he pulls the covers down to reveal dino, who is immediately "yi yi yi yi ing," hopping all over the bed and showering fred with sloppy kisses.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{dino! dino, cut it out !}
<C>__{radio woodpecker }
<D>__{in the news, bedrock civic and business leaders met yesterday to discuss the growing kibble crisis. radio woodpecker (o.s.) (cont'd) ecological activist ralph naderock warned that if new supplies of kibble are not found, our animal powered civilization itself may be threatened.}
<A>__{by now dino's affection attack has knocked both master and pet to the floor in a jumble of bedclothes, asses and elbows. dino begins to roll fred across the room like a seal playing with a ball.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{dino, that's enough here, look, daddy has a nice dino bone for you, just please stop it }
<A>__{fred has now backed up to a dresser, where he grabs a brightly colored box labeled "purinrock dino treats." fred holds it up dino gets up on two legs, eager for the treat fred shakes the box... alas, nothing comes out. dino "yi yi's" again, propelling fred into the next room.}
