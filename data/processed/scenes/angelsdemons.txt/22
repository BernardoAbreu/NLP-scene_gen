<L>__{int langdon's apartment day}
<A>__{a hand skims along a bookcase and stops at that very title, a heavy academic tome. langdon pulls it out and drops it on the desk in his apartment with a thud. (the apartment is cluttered with esoterica, the home of a man whose taste in furnishings was very fashionable about four hundred years ago. a single man no kid stuff, no cats.) langdon flips the book open to an illustrated section in the middle, filled with renderings of previous attempts to create the symbol he now holds in his hand.}
<C>__{langdon}
<A>__{incredible. either someone just figured out how to make this, or they found it. recently. which would mean the llluminati have returned.}
<P>__{(looks at vincenzo)}
<A>__{an ancient brotherhood, enemies of the church, surfacing just after the death of a pope? i'd pull you off vacation too.}
<C>__{vincenzo}
<A>__{it's worse than just that. four cardinals were kidnapped from their quarters inside the vatican some time between three and five a.m. this morning. shortly afterward, the office of the swiss guard received that document, along with the threat that the cardinals will be publicly executed, one per hour, starting at seven p.m. tonight, in rome.}

<A>__{conclave?}
<C>__{vincenzo}
<A>__{was to begin today. we have postponed its start for a few hours, a story of illness, there are no suspicions. yet.}
<C>__{langdon}
<A>__{what do you want from me?}
<C>__{vincenzo}
<A>__{the perpetrators of this heinous act sent that ambigram, you say? as a provocation, a taunt. but it may also be their undoing. if you can help us learn their identity, perhaps we can stop them.}
<C>__{langdon}
<A>__{why me?}
<C>__{vincenzo}
<A>__{your expertise. your erudition. and your involvement with recent church shall we say "mysteries?"}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{i wasn't under the impression that episode had endeared me to the vatican.}
<C>__{vincenzo}
<D>__{oh, it didn't. but it made you what is the word?}
<P>__{(italian pronunciation)}
<D>__{formidable. formidable. a plane is standing by twenty minutes from here. will you come with me?}
<A>__{langdon doesn't move, just stares at the ambigram, still amazed.}
<C>__{vincenzo }
<D>__{professor langdon, you have spent ten years of your academic life searching for the very symbol you now hold in your hand. and the madman who created it, or who knows the secrets of its origin that person is in rome.}
<P>__{(checks his watch)}
<D>__{how much longer must we pretend you have not already decided to come?}
