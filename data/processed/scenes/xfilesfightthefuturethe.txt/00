<L>__{exterior snowscape}
<A>__{a blinding white screen, under which we hear an ominous low end dolby thx big screen rumble. we're not in 19" television land anymore, toto. as the rumble builds, two black figures appear on what now has resolved into a distant horizon. from their movements we can shortly see that the figures are men. moving along a windswept ice sheet in an otherwise featureless land. a legend appears: north texas, 35,000 b.c.}
<B>__{closer on the two men}
<A>__{continuing toward us, we can now see that they are dressed in crude garments made of animal skins. if we squint we can see their hair is long, their jutting foreheads significant of primitive homo sapiens. they continue toward us, the wind beating against them, camera is craning down to the snow that lies before them. to large three toed tracks.}
<B>__{following the primitives}
<A>__{as they track the three toed prints to a rocky crevice in the hard pack ice. the prints stop here, and so do the men. dropping down into the crevice in pursuit of their quarry.}
