<A>__{hector is watching beatrice conduct some kind of ceremony over the corpse of the squire. she takes a handful of dried flowers or herbs from a pouch in her bag. mumbling strangely and quickly to herself, she walks around the corpse three times, scattering the leaves over the body. hector is fascinated, but a little uneasy. he watches from a safe distance. during the few moments that it takes, beatrice seems like a different person. then, all of a sudden, the familiar, friendly beatrice returns. she completes her ceremony by throwing a few drops of her perfume over the body. she smiles.}
