<L>__{interior ethnic bar restaurant day}
<A>__{dark, smoky. not a place for the health conscious. rodriguez and divinci at a corner booth. both with scotch and waters.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{nobody can connect us to the evidence thing... we're clean there.}
<A>__{rodriguez is quiet.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{the most important one is this dea mess anyway. once that's finished, we're completely in the clear.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{you know we can't do it anymore.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{...yeah, i guess.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{no, we're through. that's it.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{good while it lasted though. a hundred grand apiece. not bad for a few nights work.}
<A>__{divinci lifts his glass in a toast to himself, drinks.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{i just wanna get through this.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{we're gonna get through it. no evidence problems on this one.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{i hope not... i don't know, frank, lately i been thinkin'... maybe what we did wasn't such a good idea.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{hey, we took out a few scumbags, that's it. nobody's ever gonna miss those shitheels. they were all pieces of garbage. not one of 'em had a sheet less than a mile long. drugs, extortion, assault. they were all fuckin' guilty as hell and still on the street, you know that.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{except the cop.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{yeah, except the cop. that's part of the job. could just as easily have happened to you or me.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{but we're cops, you know? we fucked up.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{we fucked up once. once outa ten. that's not bad.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, okay? i'm sorry. he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, what can i say. i'm not goin' down for it.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{look, if we got paid a decent salary we wouldn't be tempted by this, right? and what happens when we retire? you think our pension's gonna take care of us? shit no. we are on our own. i mean all i want in life is a goddamn fishing boat, a beach, a couple drinks and some hawaiian fuckin' music. that ain't much for twenty years putting murdering assholes behind bars. i mean, the dealers, the pimps, the killers, they got no rules. we got all the fuckin' rules. it ain't fair. that's all i'm sayin', it ain't fair... for awhile, we made it fair.}
<A>__{rodriguez downs his scotch.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{quit thinkin' you're a bad guy. you're not a fuckin' bad guy. you made one mistake. let it go.}
<A>__{rodriguez nods. a waitress comes to the table. rodriguez orders another. the waitress leaves. rodriguez hesitates a moment, then }
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{do you think we're corrupt?}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{hey, i never took a fuckin' bribe in my life.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{me either.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{nobody ever bought me.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{no fuckin' way. even the thought makes me sick. and what we did has nothing to do with being corrupt. it's two completely different things. don't get 'em confused.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{i guess you're right.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{i'm telling you. it's nothin' to do with corrupt.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{i'm worried, that's all.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{hey, you gotta worry a little. it's natural. just don't lose your sense of humor.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{my sense of humor, right.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{the problem with people is, nobody gives a shit about makin' the world a better place. you and me, i don't care what anybody says, we made the world a better place. no matter what happens. there are ten less drug dealin' assholes on the street today because of us. they're not plea bargainin' their way back onto the street, they're not clogging up the courts, and they're not costing the tax payers a fuckin' penny because they're not in prison. they were garbage. and there's nothin' wrong with takin' out the garbage.}
<A>__{divinci downs his scotch. rodriguez nods, then }
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{so, you think you'll get back with caroline?}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{shit. nothin' i ever do is good enough, you know?}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{never is, never was, never will be.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{guess i gotta make the effort. it's gonna cost me if i don't.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{tell me about it. you know how much i got left.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{you're gonna think i'm an idiot, but... i like cynthia. there's no bullshit with her. i just fuckin' like her.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{i think you just like fuckin' her.}
<A>__{rodriguez smiles. divinci looks at him for a beat, then }
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{yeah, that, too.}
