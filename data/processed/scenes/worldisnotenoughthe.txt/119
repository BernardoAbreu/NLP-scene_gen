<L>__{interior bedroom, elektra's villa night}
<A>__{half light. they're entwined between the sheets. this is something slow, languorous, not to be rushed. we can't make out the mechanics, but they're beaded with sweat. her fingers trace the contours of his torso. linger on his bruised collar bone.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{you knew when you first saw me. you knew it would be like this.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{shush.}
<A>__{her hand dips in an ice bucket beside the bed. she rubs a slither of ice down her chest, shudders with pleasure. it's a move bond hasn't seen before. now she brings the ice to his shoulder.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{poor shoulder. looks painful...}
<A>__{she kisses his purple flesh. licks.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{...needs constant attention...}
<A>__{she slides her tongue back and fore along the groove above the tendon. and he pulls the ice from her hand:}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{enough ice for one day.}
<A>__{tosses it across the room as passion takes over...}
