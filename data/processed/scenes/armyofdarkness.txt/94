<L>__{interior courtyard}
<B>__{a viking deadite}
<A>__{looks up as he hears... chug! chug! chug! deadite's p.o.v. the doors of the blacksmith's shop burst open through the dust and smoke something appears...an iron beast...belching steam...it's angry iron blades whirling. behold...}
<B>__{the deathcoaster}
<A>__{the stripped chaise of the delta 88 oldsmobile. a steam engine is mounted to it's center to power the craft. at the front and rear are spinning, helicopter like rotor blades.}
<B>__{gold tooth}
<A>__{shovels coal into the deathcoaster's furnace.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{is at the helm. he pulls a cord. the deathcoaster's steam whistle screams to announce its birth.}
<B>__{the viking deadite}
<A>__{is cut to ribbons by swirling blades.}
<B>__{the villagers atop the parapet}
<A>__{cheer!}
<B>__{evil dead}
<A>__{at the base of the ladders look up in horror to see...}
<B>__{the steam driven rotor blades}
<A>__{slicing through two deadites at once. the cow catcher in front pushes aside the halved evil dead.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{operates a crude instrument panel with only two levers to steer the craft. it's a bumpy ride. wide shot the deathcoaster thwop! thwop! two more skeletons bite the dust. leathery hands pluck a screaming gold tooth from the craft.}
<B>__{gold tooth}
<A>__{disappears beneath the squirming corpses. a moment later he re emerges as a skeleton himself, except for the single gold tooth that shines against the white of the bone. he stands and joins the deadites.}
<B>__{evil sheila}
<A>__{leaps onto the moving deathcoaster to face ash.}
<C>__{evil sheila}
<D>__{thou didst find me beautiful once.}
<C>__{ash}
<D>__{honey...you got real ugly.}
<B>__{evil sheila}
<A>__{attacks with a shriek!}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{spins out his double barreled shot gun and... blammity blam! ...blows her off the craft. she does a back flip into the other deadites.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{pulls hard on the steering stick and it tears loose from the craft.}
<B>__{the deathcoaster}
<A>__{careens out of control.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{tumbles from the helm and hits the ground.}
<B>__{the deathcoaster}
<A>__{flips, crushes a group of deadites against a wall, and explodes.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{picks himself up from the dust. he looks upward to... ladder #2 arthur attempts to push the ladder away. a sword comes up into frame, stabbing arthur. he is yanked to his death with a shriek! evil ash, with his bloody sword, leaps up from the ladder and onto the parapet. he's headed for the book of the dead. below in the courtyard ash races to a set of ropes and pulley that ascend the parapet. two deadites come at him. he grabs the rope with his steel hand and slices one end of it with his sword. above him a net of boulders plummet down atop the two deadites, crushing them. simultaneously, ash is tanked upward by the rope, to the parapet.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{looks to...}
<B>__{evil ash}
<A>__{approaching the necronomicon.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{kicks aside a hay bale and removes a mini crossbow with four flame tipped arrows, loaded and ready. he fires.}
<B>__{a flame arrow}
<A>__{imbeds in evil ash's leg and ignites his body. another flaming dart hits his shoulder blade. the flames consume his body. he burns and shrieks!}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{watches in horror as...}
<B>__{the flames receed}
<A>__{revealing a bone white skeleton with mismatched eyes. skeletal evil ash! it races at ash with a shriek.}
<B>__{ash and evil ash}
<A>__{bring their swords together with such great force that sparks fly. ash is forced back against the stone pedestal that holds the necronomicon. clang! with a deft stroke, ash's sword is flung from his hand. ash's sword imbeds in a wooden beam.}
<B>__{evil ash}
<A>__{grabs the necronomicon, then swings his sword at ash.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{grabs a burning iron torch from its mount.}
<B>__{angle on}
<A>__{whoosh! klang! whoosh! klang! man and skeleton battle with flaming torch and sword.}
<B>__{angle on}
<A>__{klang! the torch is knocked from ash's hand. it falls over the edge of the wall and lands in the courtyard below. it ignites a fuse. the burning fuse leads to a sack of black powder. the sack sits upon the spoon of a catapult.}
<B>__{above... skeleton ash}
<A>__{swings his sword. ash leaps over the blade. the skeleton swings downward, and ash side steps it.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{rabbit punches camera.}
<B>__{close on skeleton head}
<A>__{ash's fist bursts out all it's rotted teeth.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{delivers a right hook, spinning the skeleton's head around in a circle.}
<B>__{the skeleton}
<A>__{gives ash a backwards roundhouse kick to the face. ash tumbles over the edge.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{falls to the courtyard below, alongside the catapult. he glances at the burning fuse.}
<B>__{evil ash}
<A>__{leaps from the parapet and lands atop the catapult. the skeleton looks down at ash with a nasty grin of bone.}
<B>__{skeleton ash}
<A>__{behold... he gestures to the evil dead that overrun the parapet and now battle the last twenty of arthur's warriors for control of the keep.}
<B>__{angle on skeleton ash}
<C>__{skeleton ash}
<D>__{you're finished.}
<A>__{he extends the necronomicon to taunt ash.}
<C>__{skeleton ash}
<D>__{i possess the necronomicon. i've crushed your pathetic army. now i will have my vengeance!}
<A>__{he raises his sword for the death blow...}
<B>__{the shrill call of battle trumpets}
<C>__{guard }
<D>__{duke henry's men! they've come!}
<B>__{ash and the skeleton}
<A>__{turn... a jubilant cheer rises from the castle as...}
<B>__{duke henry the red and fifty of his men}
<A>__{thunder down the hill, across the drawbridge and into the castle courtyard to attack the deadites! the skeleton atop the catapult turns back to ash and raises his sword for the kill.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{has grabbed a sword from a fallen warrior. with a single motion he slices the hand that holds the necronomicon from skeleton ash.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{snags the book with one hand and on the backswing, slices through the rope, springing the catapult.}
<B>__{the skeleton and burning satchel}
<A>__{are flung over the castle wall. high shot looking down at castle}
<B>__{the skeleton projectile}
<A>__{rockets up past camera, waving its boney arms. the burning satchel follows. boom! the skeleton is blown to bits in mid air. a cheer goes up within the castle courtyard as henry's warriors crush the last of the deadites.}
