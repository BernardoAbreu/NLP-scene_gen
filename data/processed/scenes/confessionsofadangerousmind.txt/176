<L>__{interior gong show set day}
<A>__{center stage is empty. the band begins to play. the studio audience cheers.}
<C>__{announcer }
<D>__{and now, here's the host and star of our show, chuck barris!}
<A>__{the curtain rises. barris appears in a tuxedo coat, denim work shirt, cowboy boots and a hat pulled down over his eyes.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{welcome to the gong show. here's an esoteric act if there ever was one. ephemeral. it's an ephemeral act.}
<C>__{barris }
<D>__{one that should get us our emmy. do we have an emmy? we don't? well this should get us one. anyway, ladies and gentlemen... big nose!}
<A>__{big nose leaps onto stage. he is skinny, wearing a flowered shirt and a sarong, and playing a toy flute while dancing in ladies platform shoes. suddenly he drops his flute, rips off his sarong, revealing polka dotted boxer shorts and a yellow leotard. he rushes to a steamer trunk, opens it, and begins crazily pulling out endless amounts of old newspapers. barris watches from the wings, mesmerized. big nose is gonged. barris dances out onto stage to join him.}
<C>__{big nose}
<D>__{why? why? why?}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{i don't know. i don't understand.}
<A>__{barris glances out into the audience. something glints. is it a gun. he starts to sweat. jaye p. morgan is saying something about big nose. but we can't understand it. the audience laughs. barris continues to scan the audience. someone in headphones signals barris from behind a camera.}
<C>__{barris }
<P>__{(to big nose)}
<D>__{well, win a few, lose a few.}
<P>__{(to audience)}
<D>__{we'll be back with more stuff... right after this message.}
<A>__{barris waits on his mark for the taping to again begin. he watches the commotion around him with eagle eyes: technicians and stagehands running around, the audience chanting "chuckie baby", the celebrity panel joking with each other, the guys in the booth smoking, the guys in the band laughing. barris turns around and around on his mark, trying to catch every movement, looking for a gun, a suspicious character. the chanting continues, louder and more distorted. the faces in the audience turn grotesque. barris sweats profusely, his breathing becomes more and more shallow. suddenly his eyes roll back in his head and he drops to the stage floor, unconscious.}
