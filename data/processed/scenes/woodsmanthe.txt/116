<L>__{exterior city streets night}
<A>__{walter walks down a city street with boarded up store fronts. the sidewalks are wet from a steady drizzle. cars pass by on the wet pavement. as walter walks, we intercut with a series of flashbacks: a) exterior school walter looks at the blood on his hands then at candy moaning on the ground. b) exterior park robin stands in the middle of the field, binoculars held to her eyes, scanning the trees. c) extreme close up: robin lowers the binoculars and stares us straight in the eye.}
