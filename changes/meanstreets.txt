<ACTION>__{The place is huge and there is a lot of bustle and excitement. CHARLIE is noticeable because he is the only member of the crowd who walks slowly, without any apparent mission or destination. He makes his way toward the large flight board that looms over the whole room. Loudspeakers announce planes to and from every part of the world. On the flight board, the origins and destinations of the days flight spin and change every moment. He passes the insurance machines and almost stops - more upset than before. A businessman calmly pays for insurance. (Muzak is heard) CHARLIE continues on past a novelty shop where some plastic crosses and St. Christopher medals hang alongside the stuffed toy dogs and flight bags. He looks at the cross.}
