<D>__{you know dolores, there's a lot of things i could say to you, but you're not worth the effort.}
<A>__{peggy reaches down to up her books. on the top of the pile is an open fountain pen, which she picks up, pul1ing the release lever, squirting ink all over dolores's dress. dolores drops her books, looks down at her dress, horrified.}
