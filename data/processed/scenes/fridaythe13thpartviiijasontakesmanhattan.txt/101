<A>__{as it slams open...and julius steps out, not sean, from a different deck door. track with him as he treads along the side of the ship, skeet rifle raised. julius' point of view walking past the lifeboat stations, the wind and precipitation battering the small boats. with no warning, an obscure figure leaps out, gripping an axe.}
<B>__{julius}
<A>__{shoves the gun stock into his shoulder and takes instantaneous aim...but he doesn't shoot. he slowly lowers the rifle.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{as miles lowers the axe. they've just scared the shit out of each other.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i will take the upper deck.}
<A>__{julius nods. they separate. neither boy notices the smoke which is starting to emerge from a deck vent...}
