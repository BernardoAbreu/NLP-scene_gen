<A>__{amazing how disturbing a bowling alley is when it's closed. rows of empty lanes stretching into darkness, the unlit pin areas looking like the jaws of an army of beasts.}

<A>__{beeman has stopped turning pages. that's because he's now staring at an etching of the same symbol. below are ink drawings of a ghastly beast rising up through a body. but it's what's above the beast that is most troubling. a figure on a cross his arms outstretched seemingly welcoming the beast into this world.}

<A>__{bowling ball hits a lane. beeman spins to the sound. ball rolls round and round, closer and closer until it clangs dead against the back wall of one of the lanes. beeman gets up, starts down the corridor of dormant pin machines. he stops at lane 13, leans way way down, past the machinery and peeks out the pin hole.}
