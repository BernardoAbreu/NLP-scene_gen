<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{the intern who admitted mr. guernsey, however, accepted the diagnosis and prescribed morphine, a drug suitable for angina but not at all suitable for emphysema, which is, unfortunately, what the old man actually had. within an hour...}

<A>__{room 806. night dark. just a bit of moonlight streaking through the not quite closed bathroom. the hallway door opens, and a young woman, carrying a top coat, slips quickly in giggling like hell, followed by schaefer, who is likewise giggling and admonishing her to be quiet. her name is sheila. sheila notices the other patient in the room sleeping away and looks questioningly at schaefer, who reassures her as he removes her coat. after which he strips off his own white jacket and trousers and hangs them in the armoire. the girl asks in a hoarse whisper if they're going to get totally nude and wonders if that's such a good idea. for an answer, schaefer fondles her crotch. they both giggle, they both shush each other, they giggle again; they're both stoned. the girl unzippers her dress. the dark room is filled for the moment with the flurry of undressing, flung garments, elbows, legs and arms, bumpings into each other, and sheila saying between giggles, "boy, i sure hope nobody walks in." they eventually wind up on the unoccupied bed, and the scene ends looking across the sleeping profile of the patient in the other bed as schaefer and his girl thump away at each other with much creaking of springs, moans, groans, giggles and the white limbed patterns of fornication. room 806 dark, silent, hushed. the fun and games are over. sheila is in front of the armoire. she slips back into her dress, after which she tiptoes back to the bed where schaefer is deeply asleep, smiling in postcoital peace. sheila bends, shakes his shoulder.}

<A>__{there is, of course, no response. a terrible suspicion enters nurse perez's mind, and she closes her eyes and sighs a long shuddering sigh. then she opens her eyes and, with a second and briefer sigh, reaches for schaefer's neck to take his pulse. clearly, the result is not encouraging. she sighs another short sigh and regards schaefer's unblinking, dilated pupils. it's all a bit too much for her; she shuffles to the window and stares out into the gray morning where things are a little more comprehensible. once again, she returns to the bed, regards schaefer's death mask. she raises the bedsheet and, for one short but appreciative moment, considers schaefer's naked body. she lets the bedsheet carefully down. she sighs again.}

<D>__{welbeck?! that barber!}
<C>__{brubaker}

"everybody lives with lies," i said. i grabbed him by his poncho, dragged him the full length of our seven room despicably affluent middle class apartment and flung him out. i haven't seen him since. but do you know what he said to me as he stood there on that landing on the verge of tears. he shrieked at me: "you old fink! you can't even get it up anymore!" that was it, you see. that was his real revolution. it wasn't racism and the oppressed poor and the war in vietnam. the ultimate american societal sickness was a limp dingus. hah!}
