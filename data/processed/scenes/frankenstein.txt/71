<L>__{int victor's bedroom night}
<A>__{the wee hours. rain pattering desolately on the roof. victor sleeping. wrestling with troubled dreams. through a crack in the bed curtains, we see the bedroom door slowly creak open, throwing a twisted spill of light. a shadow appears. entering. shambling and gliding across the floor. silent and furtive. creeping toward the bed. pushing slowly in on victor. moving into close up. sleeping. unaware. the shadow falls across his face. beat. his eyes fly open. an intake of breath. paralyzed. sensing the presence. feeling the shadow. working himself up to something. perhaps a scream. he can stand it no longer, thrusts out his arm, jerks the curtain aside... ...and the creature is there, looming like a specter of death. naked. beseeching. dull yellow eyes trying to understand. victor lurches from bed, sends a nightstand and vase crashing to the floor. the creature circles, seeking him, threatening to cut off his path to the door.}
