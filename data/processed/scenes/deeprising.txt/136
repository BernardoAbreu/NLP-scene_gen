<A>__{trillian goggily crawls out from under a mound of boxes. her left eye's got a nice purple shiner. her elegant gown is ripped. a very strange sound coming from behind the wall. wet. gooey. slithery. ominous. trillian freezes.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{the sound slowly moves across the wall. then another wall starts to gurgle. trillian spins around. she forces herself not to panic. very cautiously, taking small measured steps she reaches the handle to the freezer, and tries to open it. no go. the gurgling ripples above her. her mouth goes dry as her eyes follow the sound across the ceiling. her hand goes to her hair. she pulls her lock pick out, and very slowly kneels down until she is eye level with the door lock. she begins to pick her way out, her ears and eyes following the gurgling above. suddenly the sound stops. the silence makes trillian's heart sound that much louder. she sidles close to the wall.}
<C>__{trillian }
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{still silence. cautious, she taps on the wall. for a moment nothing. and then... whamm!! something slams against the wall from the other side in response. trillian falls back against the door, her heart in her throat.}
