<A>__{they stand in silence, looking at each other for a moment. the awkwardness they both feel strike them suddenly as funny. paul starts smiling. sethe covers her mouth to conceal it. and then, just as quickly, the urge to laugh subsides and the fear they feel takes it's place. paul slowly closes the door and places his shoes on the floor. sethe watches him. paul crosses to her. he moves in to kiss her. they approach each other's lips like two burn victims, trying desperately not to hurt the other with their touch.}
