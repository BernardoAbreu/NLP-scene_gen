<A>__{neil walks into a vast space. nice art, a cozy yet architectural look a cool place to live.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{hey, babe. you here?}
<A>__{we pan over to a couch where beth is wrapped in a throw blanket, watching tv. she's got her hair in a messy bun.}
<C>__{beth}

<A>__{he joins her on the couch. and sees that the tv is off.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{everything ok?}

<A>__{neil gets up again.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{you want some tea or something?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{it was my baby sister. she's getting married.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{that's great. i've always liked that devon guy. that's really great.}
<A>__{beth looks at him. she doesn't look that happy.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{do you think it's great?}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{so, you think it's great that they're getting married, but you never feel like we're going against nature or something by not getting married?}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{no, babe.}
<A>__{he sits back down, puts his arms around her.}
<C>__{neil }
<D>__{going against nature is like that cat who started nursing that monkey. we're just two people who aren't married.}
<A>__{beth manages a weak smile.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{i actually think the odds of having a successful relationship increase by not getting married. look at my parents all marriage got them was thirty two years of misery and joint checking.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{yeah, i know. i get that.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{like i've always told you i love you and we don't need a marriage certificate to legitimize our relationship.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{lemme get you some tea.}
<A>__{he exits. beth starts to cry, but quickly dries her tears, and forces herself to pull it together.}
