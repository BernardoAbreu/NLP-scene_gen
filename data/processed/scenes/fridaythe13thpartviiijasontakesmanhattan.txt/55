<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{i can't swim.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{i gathered that.}
<A>__{rennie says nothing else. miss van deusen knows she's holding out.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{i had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. it took three winters before i would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.}

<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{it's not that simple.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}

<C>__{rennie}
<P>__{(long pause)}
<D>__{whenever i get near the water, i see this young boy drowning. he tries to pull me down with him.}

<A>__{rennie nods somberly.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{did you have an accident in the lake?}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{no. it was just a normal summer. i've never been able to figure it out.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born. his name was jason voorhees.}
<A>__{the name has triggered some deep memory...but the recollection vanishes upon the sound of her uncle's voice.}

<D>__{oh, i can see that. you've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, miss van deusen.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{it wasn't her fault.}

<A>__{he starts to lead her away. the crazy deck hand blocks their path, slipping his flask away.}
<C>__{deck hand}
<D>__{he's come back and you're all going to die.}

<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{just...leave me alone...}
<A>__{she pulls away from him, hurrying off, confused and frightened. mcculloch's retinas pierce the deck hand with scorn. he checks his watch, then storms off.}
