<A>__{mika is at her computer doing what she does best: intuitively sifting through interconnected threads of information. searching through what is known about ibu battuta, she discovers information concerning the lost chapters of the "rihla," supposedly destroyed sometime in the 15th century. she remains immersed until a sound grows louder and louder. a vacuum cleaner. she checks the time. very late. she looks up and finds two eyes watching her through the crack in her open door. startled she gets up while the eyes quickly disappear. in the hallway, an older asian man is pushing the vacuum cleaner.}
