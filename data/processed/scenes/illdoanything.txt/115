<L>__{interior backstage area late afternoon}
<A>__{music now emphasizing the tension of the pre show atmosphere. matt, moving about the area, looking for jeannie, spots a cluster of other cast members excitedly awaiting their introduction. jeannie not among them. an a.d. talks with concern to a p.a.}
<C>__{a.d.}
<D>__{let me know if you see the little white girl.}
<A>__{matt, growing concerned, walks on, then: matt's pov across the stage to the distant make up room. jeannie, alone in the room, which is so brightly lit it creates a bizarre effect, as if she were under a surreal spotlight. music reprises jeannie's sinead o'connor song, "lonely life of mine."}
<B>__{on matt}
<A>__{stopping his impulse to go to her he continues to observe. matt's pov jeannie is nervous and uncertain... she plays with the handle of the make up chair... turns herself back and forth... then a very attractive ten year old boy enters the scene obviously telling her to hustle... he offers his hand and she takes it, instinctively masking all clues that this hand holding is a "first" of great moment in her life. as they move toward the main stage area, jeannie looks around, needing something... her dad.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{jeannie.}
<A>__{she turns sees her father and gives a small, cursory nod... he moves quickly, drawing even with her but still giving her a bit of space and a low key pep talk.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{just remember. you're not even here tonight. there's only this other little girl that you're pretending to be who lives at rainbow house.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{...and who just vomited.}
<A>__{matt breaks up. even jeannie smiles briefly, then she takes him aside for privacy.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{i just found out that we bow before we even do anything.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{great.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{and everybody claps.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{great.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{i made up a great bow. you going to look?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{wouldn't miss it.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{i'm not going to be able to cry. it's too hard for me.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{hey, then they'll just give you more chances after everyone leaves.}
<A>__{this does not satisfy her. she rolls her eyes as she is pulled away towards the front of the stage. matt watches as the 10 year old veteran actor leads his little daughter towards her debut.}
