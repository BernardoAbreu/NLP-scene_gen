<D>__{how long you gonna follow her around like a puppy dog? cleanin' up the messes she makes while she steps out with every guy around here other than you?!}
<A>__{jeep stiffens. turns to his father:}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{don't say that about her! she's not like that!}
<A>__{bob gives jeep a hard stare. yeah, she is.}
<C>__{bob}

<P>__{(points up at the paradise falls sign)}
<D>__{see that up there? your mother thought i was crazy for wanting to buy this place, middle of nowhere...but i just knew this was what i was supposed to do. told your mom, "just wait." told her when they finally ran the freeway through here like they were plannin' on, this place would be like grand central station.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but i was wrong. the freeway never came and now the only people who ever stop here are the ones who are lost.}

<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's time for you to move on from this place, jeep. i don't wanna see you wake up one morning old and pissed off, realizing you're lost just like everybody else who stops here.}
<A>__{jeep looks up at his father, his words hanging heavily. a tough pill to swallow.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{now get to work on that truck. i wanna have these people on the road by nightfall.}
<A>__{bob walks back into the diner. jeep is about to turn back to the garage when he notices something off in the distance. ominous dark clouds line the horizon to the south like a living wall. he shifts his gaze up the highway to the north. same thing. dark clouds are pushing their way over the distant mountains. a storm is coming.}
