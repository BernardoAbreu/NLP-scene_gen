<C>__{sid}
<D>__{is that what you know?}
<A>__{beth stares at his face for a long time.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i know...}
<A>__{she kisses him, suddenly, long and slow.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{i know you.}
<A>__{they kiss, pulling each other tight. they lose their balance and stagger against the swingset, kissing passionately. beth pulls back.}

<D>__{that's right.}
