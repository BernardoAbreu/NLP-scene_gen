<L>__{interior valerie's front room. day}
<A>__{the drum and bass track continues to thud through the wall. a fresh pot of tea stands next to an empty can of soft drink. shifty pulls out two rocks of crack and places them before val. chris watches with intent. he almost can't believe what he's seeing. she opens the cellophane and places down a small yellowy lump. then carefully she fashions the can into a smoking utensil. at that moment, one of her cat ornaments falls from the shelf because of the vibrating bass. valerie walks over, picks up the china tabby, and places it carefully back on the side. she sits back down, clearly distressed by the music. we're tight on the can as valerie lifts the paraphernalia to her mouth and takes a hit, a small grimace etched across her lips. she gestures with her hand offering chris some.}

<D>__{no, no, i'm fine......thanks though.}
<B>__{close on shifty.}
<C>__{shifty}
<D>__{look val we're gonna have to do one...}
<A>__{the camera pans to val she looks anaesthetized back to}
<B>__{shifty...}
<A>__{shifty nods at chris for them both to leave. the thudding bass echoes out as they exit the flat. chris looks slightly unsettled by what he's seen.}
