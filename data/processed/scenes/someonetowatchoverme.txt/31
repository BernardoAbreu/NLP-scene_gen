<A>__{the room is dim, lit only by a desk lamp, claire seated on a couch, catatonic, neil kneading her hand, trying to comfort her. a knock at the door: neil jumps up to open it mike entering before he gets there.}
<C>__{neil}
<P>__{(upset)}
<D>__{are you in charge here?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{no, sir...}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{i asked for the man in charge...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{that would be lieutenant garber, and he's very busy upstairs...}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{don't tell me he's "busy". i asked for an ambulance for this woman and...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{is she injured?}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{mike gets his first view of her as she turns her head into the light. it is an almost storybook vision of beauty that emerges from the darkness around her; her vulnerability penetrates to the very core.}
<C>__{neil}
<P>__{(to claire)}
<D>__{you're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{she's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness. could i ask you to step outside, please.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{no, i will not step outside.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{sir, i am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone. help me out here, could you please leave.}
<C>__{neil}
<P>__{(icily)}
<D>__{i don't really see what that has to do with...}
<C>__{claire}

<D>__{neil, do what he says.}
<A>__{angle on mike and neil: at a standoff.}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{mike opens the door for neil. neil reluctantly swallows it.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{i will be right outside.}
<A>__{neil grudgingly leaves. mike quietly closes the door. angle change: claire and mike alone. he sits down. a beat.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{can i get you a cup of coffee or something?}
<A>__{her plaintive eyes turning to meet his.}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(lost)}
<D>__{i've never seen anyone killed before.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{it's okay... i've never been a detective before either...}
<A>__{she lifts her gaze quizzically, catching his smile. she returns it in spite of herself, disarmed by his frankness, and curiously reassured.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{we'll go slow. okay? we'll get through it together.}
