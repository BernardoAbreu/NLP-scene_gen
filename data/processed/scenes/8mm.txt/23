<L>__{exterior christian compound dusk}
<A>__{a huge old world mansion is situated at the center of acres of pennsylvania forest and vast gardens. welles' car heads down a long tree lined drive, to the dark mansion.}

<A>__{welles follows a butler down a long hall.}
<L>__{interior christian house, library night}
<A>__{the butler shows welles in, shuts the door. towering shelves of books are serviced by ladders. far across the room, an old, sad woman, mrs. christian, sits waiting with a tall, thin, sinister ghoul of a lawyer.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{mister welles. you're very prompt.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i try to be.}
<A>__{welles crosses towards them. it takes a while.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{i appreciate your coming on such short notice.}
<A>__{mrs. christian holds out her hand and welles takes it.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{this is mister longdale, my late husband's attorney.}
<A>__{welles shakes longdale's limp hand, looking him over.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{uh huh, pleasure.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{apparently mr. longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and i speak.}
<C>__{longdale}
<D>__{yes, i do have something to say. i insisted on being here as soon as i heard mrs. christian contacted you.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i'm listening.}
<C>__{longdale}
<D>__{as mr. christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{of what sort?}
<C>__{longdale}
<D>__{you are a private investigator?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{longdale}
<D>__{well, whatever reasons mrs. christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, i should certainly be a party to. but, since she feels differently, i can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{yes, how theatrical. so you've gone on the record, and now perhaps you should just be gone.}
<A>__{longdale's irritated, but has no choice. he walks away.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{have a pleasant evening.}
<P>__{(to welles)}
<D>__{will you have tea, mister welles?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{mrs. christian begins pouring tea from the service on a table. welles watches longdale exit.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{he's odd.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{he's a lawyer.}
<P>__{(offers tea)}
<D>__{please, sit, here...}
<A>__{welles accepts a dainty tea cup and saucer, taking a seat.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{i've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in harrisburg, in lancaster and hershey. asking about you. i must say you have friends in influential places.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i've been privileged to provide services for people i admire.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{you are highly recommended. praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.}
<A>__{welles nods, sipping tea.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{as you know, my husband passed away recently. two weeks ago now.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{my condolences.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{his passing has left me with... something of a dilemma. a terrible, terrible dilemma.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i will do whatever i can to help.}
<A>__{mrs. christian studies welles.}
