<L>__{interior reichministry goebbels' office night}
<A>__{goebbels' office is now the scene of great activity. soldiers rush in and out carrying orders. goebbels is on two phones at the same time. through the melee comes none other than heinrich himmler the bespectacled villain whose appearance is unmatched in fiction. his arrival cannot be good.}
<C>__{goebbels}
<D>__{have you seen the fuhrer? is he }
<C>__{himmler}
<D>__{it seems the conference table shielded him from the blast. he's lucky to be alive.}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{do you want to tell me what's going on?}
<C>__{goebbels}
<D>__{everything is under control. i've taken charge of the guard battalion and given them new orders. we're turning the tables on these cowards.}
<C>__{himmler}
<D>__{i've been sent here personally by the fuhrer to collect the conspirators. he insists they be taken alive.}
<A>__{goebbels and himmler, two of the most evil men who ever lived, smile coldly. being taken alive by this mob is obviously a fate worse than death. goebbels turns to a nearby aide.}
<C>__{goebbels}
<D>__{take this down. by order of adolf hitler...}
<A>__{clack clack clack clack clack...}
