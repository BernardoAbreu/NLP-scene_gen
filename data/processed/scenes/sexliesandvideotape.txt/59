<A>__{john watching the tape. there is video snow on the monitor now. the tape timer reads 46:02. john gets up slowly, ejects the tape from the player, and heads for the door. graham, hearing the footsteps approach, backs away from the inlet. his eye is swollen, and he holds one of his hands in a curious position. john opens the door. he looks at graham for a moment before reaching into his pocket for graham's keys. he dangles them in his hand as he stands over graham.}
