<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior kelvin's room}
<A>__{kelvin is asleep. rheya is next to him. offscreen, we hear the door open. someone walks quietly (though not surreptitiously) through the frame and sits. after a long beat, kelvin bolts upright, his mind struggling to clear. when it does:}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{gibarian.}
<C>__{gibarian}
<D>__{leave the light off.}
<A>__{a beat. kelvin tries to get his bearings.}
<C>__{gibarian}
<D>__{i wish you'd come a little sooner. i might not have had to kill myself.}
<A>__{he smiles, looking at kelvin.}
<C>__{gibarian}
<D>__{you think you're dreaming me, like you dream her. understand something: i am the real gibarian. just a new incarnation.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{gibarian}
<D>__{you're being tricked. sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors. he's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field. twenty four hours a day, until they're back on earth.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{can it work?}
<C>__{gibarian}
<D>__{it can. ordinary matter, like ours? not affected. everything else, disintegrates.}
<A>__{kelvin registers this.}
<C>__{gibarian}
<D>__{what i'm saying is: don't trust anyone. find yourself a weapon of some sort.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{i can trust rheya.}
<C>__{gibarian}
<D>__{you'll end up like me.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{you're not gibarian...}
<C>__{gibarian}
<D>__{no? who am i, then?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{a puppet.}
<C>__{gibarian}
<D>__{and you're not? maybe you're my puppet. but like all puppets, you think you're actually human. it's the puppet's dream. wondering if they're human!}
<A>__{gibarian smiles.}
<B>__{kelvin}
<A>__{wakes up, gulping air. rheya, startled:}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{gibarian. he was here.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{you said he was dead.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{he is. but he was here...}
<A>__{he moves to the chair, looking for some residue of gibarian, some proof. finding none:}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{he spoke to me.}
<A>__{kelvin leaves the room. after a few beats, rheya follows.}
