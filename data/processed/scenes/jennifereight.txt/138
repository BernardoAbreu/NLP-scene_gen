<L>__{137: interior bedroom. berlin's house. day.}
<A>__{helena is curled up under blankets. maybe day dreaming but not asleep. she's maybe here to keep warm as much as anything else. sound of a vehicle approaching and she sits to listen. the car pulls up and its engine silences. helena is already out of bed.}
<L>__{138: interior living room porch front yard. house. day.}
<A>__{silhouette of a figure outside the front door. someone rattles the handle but it's locked. and by the time helena reaches the door the visitor has gone. thinking it's berlin she twists the key and steps onto the porch. a stale winter fog settling down. hardly a sound except her own voice. "john? is that you?" just the rattle of local crows and a bull heaving somewhere in some distant field. "john?" she cautiously descends wood stairs and walks two or three paces before bumping into a brown chevrolet. exploration of the car establishes nil. more confused than con cerned she listens. country sound and not a sound out of place then suddenly she is alert. something clatters somewhere. like cans kicked in the garage? was it the garage? "john, is it you?"}
