<L>__{interior lobby. day}
<A>__{paul walks through the lobby. he carries an ash tray to a trash can, the futile task of a dedicated hotel manager on auto pilot. he sees a un jeep pull up outside.}
<L>__{exterior hotel forecourt. day}
<A>__{paul meets the un soldiers, (they are the four ghanians who guard the gate). they look frightened.}
<C>__{un observer}
<D>__{the policemen have gone. what happened?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i ran out of whiskey. please go down and guard us.}
<A>__{then roar of an engine and the crash of splintering wood. as a battered toyota pickup appears, it races up the driveway. the truck drags the wooden gatehouse on a rope behind. crazed militia pack the bed of the pickup. bang, bang, bang. a militia man fires a pistol into the air. the tutsi refugees camped on the lawn flee in panic as the militia truck speeds around the driveway. the militia taunt and yell at the tutsi refugees. the truck does a screeching turn and heads back down the driveway, leaving a trail of splintered wood.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{get down there and stop them, please.}
<A>__{now the ghanians are really frightened.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{get down and stop them.}
<C>__{un soldier}
<D>__{you know we cannot shoot.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what do you mean you cannot shoot?}
<C>__{un soldier}
<D>__{we are peacekeepers, it is not in our mandate to shoot.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{then go and pretend you are soldiers.}
