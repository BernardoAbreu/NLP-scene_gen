<L>__{interior trafalgar suit corridor day}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you've got five minutes.}
<A>__{he is shown in through big golden doors. karen stays outside.}
<L>__{interior the trafalgar suite sitting room day}
<A>__{there anna is, framed in the window. glorious.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i brought these, but clearly...}
<A>__{there are lots of other flowers in the room.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{oh no, ho these are great.}
<A>__{a fair amount of tension. these two people hardly know each other and the first and last time they met, they kissed.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{sorry about not ringing back. the whole two names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea sized intellect.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no, it's a stupid privacy thing. i always choose a cartoon character last time out, i was mrs. bambi.}
<A>__{at which moment jeremy, karen's boss, comes in. a fairly grave, authoritative fifty year old pr man consulting a list.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{everything okay?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{yes, thanks.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{and you are from 'horse and hound' magazine?}
<A>__{william nods.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{is that so?}
<A>__{william shrugs his shoulders. jeremy settles at a little desk in the corner and makes notes. a pause. william feels he has to act the part. they sit in chairs opposite each other.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{so i will just fire away, shall i?}
<A>__{anna nods.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{right. ahm... the film's great... and i just wondered whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{ahm well we would have liked to but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{obviously. very difficult.}
<A>__{jeremy leaves. william puts his head in his hands. he was panic.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i'm sorry i arrived outside they thrust this thing into my hand i didn't know what to do.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no, it's my fault, i thought this would all be over by now. i just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing. i seriously don't know what got in to me. i just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{absolutely fine about it.}
<A>__{re enter jeremy.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{do remember that miss scott is also keen to talk about her next project, which is shooting later in the summer.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{oh yes excellent. ahm any horses in that one? or hounds, of course. our readers are equally intrigued by both species.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it takes place on a submarine.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yes. right... but if there were horses, would you be riding them yourself or would you be getting a stunt horse person double sort of thing?}
<A>__{jeremy exits.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i'm just a complete moron. sorry. this is the sort of thing that happens in dreams not in real life. good dreams, obviously it's a dream to see you.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{and what happens next in the dream?}
<A>__{it's a challenge.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{well, i suppose in the dream dream scenario. i just... ahm, change my personality, because you can do that in dreams, and walk across and kiss the girl but you know it'll never happen.}
<A>__{pause. then they move towards each other when... jeremy enters.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{time's up, i'm afraid. sorry it was so short. did you get what you wanted?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{very nearly.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{maybe time for one last question?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{jeremy goes out it's their last seconds.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{are you busy tonight?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{they look at each other. jeremy enters, with another journalists in tow. anna and william stand and shake hands formally.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{well, it was nice to meet you. surreal but nice.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{thank you. you are 'horse and hound's' favorite actress. you and black beauty. tied.}
