<L>__{interior 30th floor corridor day}
<A>__{sam steps out of the lift.the lift doors close. sam looks up and down the corridor hearing nothing. silence. then he, and we, begin to hear a sound. it is a curious whirring murmuring tummeling sound, and it seems to be growing closer. suddenly a scrum of people swings into view around a corner at the far end of the rather long corridor. at the centre of the scrum is a tall man with a magisterial expression and an air of eternal bustle. this is mr warren. he is surrounded by the expediters who are competing for his attention with bits of paper and bits of sentences. mr warren is snapping out decisions. satisfied expediters drop out of the scrum at intervals, disappearing one at a time through one of the many doors which line both sides of the corridor.the scrum doesn't get any smaller because new expediters dart out of other doors and join the milling mob. the whole circus is coming by sam at the rate of knots. the sound it makes breaks down into something like this.}
