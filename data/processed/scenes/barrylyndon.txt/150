<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{she would try my temper, at home, too, in a thousand ways. when requested by me to entertain the company with conversation, wit, and learning, of which she was a mistress; or music, of which she was an accomplished performer, she would, as often as not, begin to cry, and leave the room. my company from this, of course, fancied i was a tyrant over her; whereas, i was only a severe and careful guardian of a silly, bad tempered and weak minded lady.}
