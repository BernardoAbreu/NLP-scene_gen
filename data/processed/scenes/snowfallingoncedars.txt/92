<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{ishmael wanders through a silent room. a bed, a dresser. work table and lamp. a room denuded of all decoration, all possessions, all sign of life.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{i came back from the war to this room. i stayed a few months. until my father passed.}
<L>__{exterior veteran's cemetery day}
<A>__{ishmael at 24, the left sleeve of his dark suit of mourning pinned at the elbow. the diggers are filling a grave in distance. mourners mingle, some casting glances back at ishmael. keeping their distance out of awkwardness rationalized as respect. one man comes to him. masato nagaishi is aging and frail. but his voice is clear...}
<C>__{nagaishi}
<D>__{the japanese people of the island are saddened by this loss. your father was a man of great fairness and compassion for others...}
<A>__{he stands at a respectful distance. ishmael clears his throat. he nods, thank you. no words to say. so the small man adds...}
<C>__{nagaishi}
<D>__{a friend to us. and to all people.}
<A>__{silence. they are a tableau of stone. finally...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{well...}
<A>__{and no more. the man takes a step back...}
<C>__{nagaishi}
<D>__{we know you will follow in his footsteps. and honor his legacy.}
<A>__{which changes ishmael's face. to something harder.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{i thought it then. and often since. a balance, he's said. finding the facts. that folks needed to know.}
