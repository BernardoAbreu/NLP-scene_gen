<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{jane opening the door. rochester is there, standing in the frozen hurricane and howling darkness.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{jane.}
<A>__{jane pulls him inside. she falls into his arms. they embrace passionately. jane is actively pulling him towards her, delirious with love and longing.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{the exact same shot of jane opening the door. st john rivers is there, having waded through the drifting snow.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{mr st john what on earth brings you away from your hearth on a night like this? has anything happened? there's no bad news i hope?}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{how easily alarmed you are.}
<A>__{he takes off his cloak; stamps the snow off his boots.}
<C>__{st john }
<D>__{the snow was up to my waist at one pointerior}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you are recklessly rash about your own health.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{nonsense.}
<A>__{st john's eyes alight on jane's charcoal drawing. jane snatches it away too late. there is a moment of silence.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{why are you come?}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{an inhospitable question.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i mean on a night like this }
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{i got tired of my mute books and empty rooms. besides i've been told half a story and i'm most impatient to find out the end.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{please...}
<A>__{jane motions to st john to sit. he doesn't. she becomes increasingly uneasy as he speaks.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{twenty years ago, a poor curate fell in love with a rich man's daughter and married her. she was disowned by her family and two years later the rash pair were both dead. they left a daughter which charity received into her lap as cold as that snow drift i almost stuck fast in. charity carried the friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations. it was reared by an aunt in law; i come to names now mrs reed of gateshead.}
<A>__{jane starts. she is on her feet.}
<C>__{st john }
<D>__{mrs reed kept the orphan ten years and at the end of that time she was sent to lowood school.}
<C>__{st john }
<D>__{it seems her career there was very honourable. she became a teacher like yourself, and left it, like yourself, to be a governess. she undertook the education of the ward of a certain mr rochester }
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{mr rivers! }
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{i can guess your feelings but hear me to the end. of mr rochester's character i know nothing but he professed to offer honourable marriage to this young girl and at the very altar she discovered that he had a wife yet alive. his subsequent conduct is a matter of pure conjecture but when the governess was enquired after it was discovered that she had fled thornfield hall and no trace of her has since been found. now isn't that an odd tale?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{since you know so much, perhaps you can tell me how he is.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{mr rochester; how is he?}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{i'm ignorant of all concerning him.}
<A>__{st john opens his pocket book and removes a piece of paper.}
<C>__{st john }
<D>__{well, since you won't ask the governess's name, i must tell you. i have it written down here in black and white.}
<A>__{he hands her the paper. on it are doodled the heads of some of her pupils. she has absently written jane eyre in the margin several times.}
<C>__{st john }
<D>__{a solicitor named briggs wrote to me of a jane eyre. i knew a jane elliott. this paper resolved my suspicion into certainty.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{the solicitor mr briggs does he have any news of mr rochester?}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{are you not going to enquire why he has gone to such lengths to find you?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{what does he want with me?}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{merely to tell you that your uncle, mr john eyre of madeira, is dead; that he has left you all his property and that you are now rich.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{you are rich; quite an heiress.}
<A>__{silence. jane is flabbergasted.}
<C>__{st john }
<D>__{your fortune is vested in the english funds; briggs has the will and all the necessary documents. you can enter on immediate possession.}
<A>__{at last, jane looks questioningly up at him.}
<C>__{st john }
<D>__{your forehead unbends at last; i thought you were turning to stone. perhaps now you will ask how much you are worth.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{how much am i worth?}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{oh a trifle. twenty thousand pounds but what of that?}
<A>__{the news literally takes jane's breath away.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{twenty thousand pounds?}
<A>__{st john begins to laugh at jane's reaction. she has never seen him laugh before.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{if you'd committed a murder and i'd found you out, you could scarcely look more aghast.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{there must be some mistake. it's two thousand, surely.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{it's twenty. you look desperately miserable about it, i must say.}
<A>__{jane still cannot take it in. she frowns in disbelief.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{why did mr briggs write to you?}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{you see, that is the strange thing. it makes me wonder what power or providence led you to our door. your name is jane eyre.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{then i'm you namesake. i was christened st john eyre rivers.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{st john eyre }
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{my mother had two brothers, one was a clergyman, your father, the other was john eyre of madeira. mr briggs wrote to inform us that the clergyman's daughter was lost. i have been able to find her out; that is all.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{your mother was my father's sister?}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{my uncle john was your uncle john?}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{that is correct.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{so you, diana and mary }
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{we are cousins, yes.}
<A>__{jane is deeply moved.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{oh, i am glad! i am glad!}
<A>__{she throws her arms around st john. tears of happiness start to flow. he, finding it peculiar to be held, gently tries to calm her.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{here you are neglecting essential points to pursue trifles. you were utterly downhearted when i told you that you were rich and now, for a matter of no moment, you are deliriously happy.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{of no moment? you have sisters and maybe don't care for a cousin but i have nobody. i have been alone, always. and now three relations are born into my world full grown. oh, i am glad. you, who saved my life }
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{you must try to tranquillise your feelings.}
<A>__{jane finally releases him, still radiant with joy.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{write to diana and mary. tell them to hand in notice and come home. they will have five thousand each and so will you.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{i've told you the news too quickly. you're confused.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{don't put me out of patience, cousin. i am rational enough. twenty thousand divided equally between the nieces and nephews of our uncle, gives five to each.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{this is acting on first impulse. you don't know what it is to have wealth }
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{and you cannot imagine family i never had a home. i never had brothers and sisters }
<A>__{a terrible thought occurs to her.}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{you are not reluctant to own me, are you?}
<A>__{st john takes her hand. she has surprised and moved him. he looks at her, seeing her anew.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{jane, i will be your brother.}
