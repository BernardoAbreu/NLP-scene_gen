<L>__{interior pan's diner day}
<A>__{a sideways image: an out of focus coffee creamer. xander wakes up with his head on the counter of a diner. he shakes out the cobwebs.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{what the hell?}
<A>__{whip pan as a waitress walks by. xander blinks.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{hey. where am i? how did i get here?}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{i don't know, you wandered in ten minutes ago and put your head down. i told you we were closing.}
<A>__{xander looks around, sees a trucker chewing with his mouth open. a salesman buried in his newspaper. xander gets up. where the hell is he? he takes a step towards the door.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{want some coffee?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{the waitress pours him coffee. quick push to: her hands are shaking.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{you alright?}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{fine, just fine. come on and sit. i will get you something to eat.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{yeah, sure.}
<A>__{xander sits. when he swigs his coffee, he notices something written on his napkin in shaky ballpoint: "s.o.s." what the hell? he looks at the trucker. the trucker's staring at the waitress. quick push to: the trucker has a bulge underneath his vest... then push to: the salesman's eyes darting about suspiciously, newspaper pulled up to his nose. something is going down... he hears a slowed down voice and glances back at the trucker, who's now fixing him with a death stare. xander snaps from his reverie.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{trucker}
<D>__{i said, you got a problem, boy?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{problem? no, no problem. you go right ahead.}
<C>__{trucker}
<D>__{with what? i said, go right on ahead with what?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{whatever, dude.}
<A>__{the trucker and the salesman look at each other. suddenly they jump up. the trucker pulls a pistol from his vest, the salesman brandishes the shotgun he had behind the paper. the waitress cringes.}
<C>__{trucker}
<D>__{alright, nobody make a move!}
<P>__{(to xander)}
<D>__{shoulda walked away when you had the chance, dumb shit.}
<C>__{salesman}
<D>__{forget him, buck, let's just do it.}
<C>__{trucker}
<D>__{shut up!}
<P>__{(in xander's face)}
<D>__{you keep still or i'm gonna make damn sure you stop breathing today. got that?}
<A>__{xander stays strangely calm, his senses now fully focused.}
<C>__{xander}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{alright, "buck", whatever you say.}
<A>__{the waitress let's out a whimper.}
<C>__{trucker}
<D>__{keep your gotdam mouth shut and empty that register! couldn't just let him leave, could ya! you know what i'm gonna do to ya for that? huh? do ya?!}
<A>__{she goes to open the register and knocks a tray of glasses on the floor. xander springs into action. he chops down on the trucker's arm and elbows him in the face. xander twists the gun out of his hand and kicks his legs out from under him. the salesman pumps on his shotgun, but it seems to be jammed.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{better shoot me quick.}
<A>__{the salesman fights with his gun but can't get it to work. xander advances on him.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{too late!}
<A>__{he unleashes with a series of rapid front kicks to the jaw. the salesman goes crashing through the kitchen doors. xander turns to the terrified waitress.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{alright, bitch, what's going on?}
<A>__{she stares at him, unable to speak. he raises the gun.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{talk! what's the game? who are you people?}
<A>__{the front door bell jingles. a guy with an impeccably tailored suit and a cane hobbles in. it's gibbons. there a problem, mr. cage?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{who the hell are you?}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{the name's gibbons. you were saying?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{what is this place?}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{looks like a diner.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{diner, huh? let me tell you what the problem is. i wake up drugged to find what? you've got a "salesman" over here reading a three week old newspaper. he's pulling a 211 with a "trucker", who happens to be packing a cop issue h&k 9mm. i get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. how's that for twisted logic? how did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before i "walked" in? and if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until i woke up to gaffle the money? then i notice how beefy they both are. hell, even the waitress is cut. all three of them look like they went through the same training program. ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. that's how i knew yo yo wouldn't get a round off even if i gave him all day. why?}
<A>__{he aims at the waitress and fires! she's startled, but unhurt.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{cuz there's nothing but blanks in these guns. and no offense, but their performances were terrible.}
<A>__{xander tosses the gun on the counter. gibbons gives a sly smile.}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{not bad. not bad at all. have a seat.}
<A>__{gibbons sits in a booth. xander sits across from him. in the background the waitress helps the trucker and salesman up.}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. i expected you to do the same.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{that shows me already that you don't have a clue. what's it to you, anyway?}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. that tells me something about your character.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{good for you. now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. you didn't go through all this for my benefit.}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{it's your lucky day. you just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{a fed, i shoulda known. who else would have this kind of budget? now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{alright, cage, you've got me. this is one of those moments. "many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. your government needs you. are you up for the challenge?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{..if you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{why is that?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{look at me, dude, do i look like a fan of law enforcement? forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. i woulda saved you a lot of trouble.}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{oh i don't know, i think the tests work pretty well. sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{are we done now? you've got nothing on me. so if you ain't booking me, i'm walking.}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{you've got this wrong. you're not under arrest, you've been abducted. and until i say different, you belong to me.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{is that a fact?}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{sure as gravity. i've had a feeling about you from the start, cage. it's nausea.}
<C>__{xander}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{you know what i hate? any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're god.}
<C>__{gibbons}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{you know what i hate? it's always the assholes that pass the tests.}
<A>__{there's a pop and xander clutches his stomach. gibbons tosses his dart gun onto the table. xander blinks at him. he pulls another chrome dart from his gut and examines it.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{you bastards love to see me sleep.}
<A>__{whack! he goes face down on the table.}
