<L>__{interior mcdonald's day}
<A>__{dwayne and jay sit at a table with a fast food feast spread out. dwayne eats a big mac, a look of utter satisfaction on his face, a man whom the gods have finally smiled down upon.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i remember the summer after my mother passed was the first year they had the monopoly game at mcdonald's. i musta come here three times a day trying to collect all the game pieces. packed on 20 pounds, got acne from all the grease. the major said i was the fattest, ugliest 13 year old he ever laid eyes on. but i didn't care, i just wanted to win the money and get the fuck out of there. so, one night, i followed this skinny register kid home, jumped him. i kept whaling on him, asking him where they were hiding the park place piece. the million dollar prize. but he didn't know shit. a year later, the major won the lotto. i asked him for a sega genesis. he bought me one of those paddles with the ball attached.}
<A>__{dwayne goes for a fry, sees his carton is empty and grabs a handful of jay's.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i'm not ashamed to admit that i've gone through some dark times since then. depression. addiction to a variety of shit, which i won't go into. i know you must think that's pretty silly, especially since you manage to get through the day and you don't got shit going on as compared to me. but that's just the way it is. that's life.}
<A>__{jay looks pretty affected that dwayne is opening up to him.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you know, i've been pretty low, too... if you ever want to talk about that kinda stuff.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{no. i don't. my whole point i was trying to make before you interrupted me was that that shit is all in the past. 'cause i did it. i finally pulled it off.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{we pulled it off, dwayne. the two us. we're a good team.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{are we? would you do anything to protect me, my money, my empire?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{yeah, sure...}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{i mean, like what kinda stuff are we talking about?}
<A>__{dwayne takes out his cell, keys in the speed dial code and slides the cell across the table to jay.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{would you push the button?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{why would you want me to do that?}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{it's just a question, jay. would you? if i asked you?}
<C>__{dwayne }
<D>__{i mean, it's no different than those watermelons.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{watermelons aren't alive.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{yeah, they are. not the ones you blew up, though.}
<A>__{dwayne stares hard at jay. a tense beat.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{no one gets hurt...right, dwayne?}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{oh, yeah. i forgot about that part.}
<A>__{dwayne cracks a smile.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{anyway, he hasn't even made the drop yet. i'm gonna go take a shit. stay away from the bathroom. someone could get hurt.}
<A>__{dwayne heads off. jay eyes the cell phone he has left behind.}
