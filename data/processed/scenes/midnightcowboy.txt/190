<L>__{interior macalbertsons' loft night}
<A>__{joe realizes he is back at the party, ratso whispering hoarsely.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{... i'd say she was good for ten bucks, but i will ask for twenty...}
<A>__{but joe is watching with terrible fascination as hansel and gretel lift the flower girl from her sarcophagus.}
<C>__{shirley's voice}
<D>__{did you know? we were going to make it?}
<A>__{joe glances down to see himself flanked by ratso and shirley.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{you really want to do business?}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{who's he? oh god! don't tell me you two are a couple ?}
<A>__{the flower girl, hypnotically dazed, accepts a broom dipped in black paint and smears a huge x across love. joe laughs.}
<C>__{hansel's voice}
<D>__{why are you laughing, joe?}
<A>__{hansel holds a microphone toward joe, who shrugs, grinning at ratso and shirley. gretel's camera moves down joe's body.}
<C>__{hansel}
<D>__{are you for real, joe?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well, i ain't a f'real cowboy, but i'm one hell of a stud!}
<A>__{shirley glances at ratso, who nods, whispering in her ear.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{a very expensive stud. and i happen to be his manager.}
<A>__{the scene from joe's viewpoint becomes increasingly confusing and fragmented, dialogue and image moving in and out of focus, cameras and lights surrounding him, keeping the center of attention in his own blown mind... ... shirley's eyes unnaturally bright, inspecting his body, lingering on his thighs, moistening her lips...}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{it's too much to come face to face with a walking talking sex fantasy to buy a man's god!}
<A>__{... the tall black girl dancing in stroble light, starting to remove her clothes gretel following her with a camera...}
<C>__{shirley's voice}
<D>__{i can't wait to tell my man monday. i should be taking notes. look at my arm!}
<A>__{... shirley's talon like fingernails caressing the gooseflesh on her tanned arm...}
<C>__{ratso's voice}
<D>__{i gotta sit down. i feel crummy.}
<A>__{ratso stretched out on a victorian love seat the flower girl walking unsteadily, passing out dead daffodils, placing one in ratso's hand gretel photographing his reaction...}
<C>__{shirley's voice}
<D>__{eat it a man in your line of work has to keep his strength up...}
<A>__{... shirley bringing joe a massive sandwich on a paper plate, watching him bite into it...}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{it's fantastic, now i know, everything you do has sexual implications. if i you know, bought it could i take pictures of you naked? that's part of it, isn't it, kinky kinda things?}
<A>__{... the tall black girl and a few others are trying to promote an orgy. a scrofulous old wino dances spastically, working his toothless gums, preparing to expose himself to two girls dancing together...}
<C>__{hansel's voice}
<D>__{we want you, joe. you've been chosen.}
<A>__{... five youths stand beside the sarcophagus two sailors, two cycle freaks, a weight lifter waiting to be pallbearers. joe joins them. all lights and cameras are turned on the slow funeral procession, carrying the flower girl out of the loft to the tune of "moonlight and roses". strobe light adds to the unreality of the scene...}
<C>__{shirley's voice}
<D>__{i had a thing for him. before i knew. why should knowing make it more of a thing?}
<A>__{... shirley talks to gretel as she photographs the funeral.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{naturally i will have to ask myself why a cowboy? and why a cowboy whore? but not tonight.}
