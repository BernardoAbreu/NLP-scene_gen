<A>__{... and sets it down beside jordan, languishing in a tub. snow builds on a window sill. facing jordan, the man slides into the tub.}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{so why're you even considering it? are you?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{just like you would be.}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{spec recon. those guys are world class warriors. and they will not want you there, jordan.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i take it you don't either. feet.}
<A>__{dutifully, royce massages her feet.}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{well, you're doin' shit hot at intel.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{royce. we're the same age, we started the same time and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while i'm still down in the bullpen. what does that tell you about the navy?}
<C>__{royce}
<P>__{(shaking head)}
<D>__{she's haze grey and underway...}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{you need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off limits to people with tits. i'm topped out at intel. forget the glass ceiling i'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{so dump on me.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{this has nothing to do with you.}
<C>__{royce}
<P>__{(getting out)}
<D>__{well, guess i don't even need to be here...}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{get your dick back here. it has everything to do with you.}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{you're such a ball breaker sometimes. especially at night.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{sorry. but after our days...}
<P>__{(a thoughtful sip)}
<D>__{so if i try this thing... if i ship out to coronado... what happens here?}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{i will try to keep the door open. if you wash out, i make it so that }
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{wai', wait. what happens if it works? four months of training, three years of operational duty. what then?}
<C>__{royce}
<P>__{(blowing a sigh)}
<D>__{i don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, jordan. maybe we should just let it happen.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{which is guy speak for...}
<C>__{royce}
<P>__{(conceding)}
<D>__{sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth. but i'm trying to be honest, okay? three years is a long time. don't ask me to predict how i will feel then, jordan, because i don't know. and either do you.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{you know, right up until you said that i thought i did know.}
<A>__{wounded, she gets out.}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{jordan...}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{thank you, royce. it was shaping up like such a tough call and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. really, thank you so much.}
<A>__{she punches into a robe and leaves. royce considers drowning himself in the tub.}
