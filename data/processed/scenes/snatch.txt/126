<D>__{you got ballsl}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{you want to test em?}
<C>__{btt}
<D>__{there are two types of balls, there are big brave balls and there are little mincy faggot balls. p wnny you're a dead man talking. these are your last words so make them a prayer.}
<A>__{vinny takes aim.}
<C>__{btt}
<D>__{so you're obviously the big dick, and they on either side of you, must be your balls.}
<A>__{vin goes to hit him with the gun but it's caught by tony, vin tries to pull the nose out of tony's hand but he can't move it. sol steps forward and raises his gun.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{let go of the gun.}
<A>__{vinny cocks his gun. there is a pause and eventually tony lets go of it.}
<C>__{btt}
<D>__{i am talking for your benefit. now dicks have drive, and clarity of vision.}
<A>__{tony starts to build himself a complicated looking weapon under the table, unseen by the black guys. he takes bits out of one sock and bits out of another sock.}
<C>__{btt }
<D>__{but they're not clever, they smell pussy, and they want a piece of the action, and the dimmer the dick, the less he cares about the consequences, and you thought you smelt gooood ol pussy, and have brought your little mincy faggot balls along for a gooood ol time, but you have got your parties muddled up, there is no pussy here, just a dose to make you wish you were born a woman..}
<A>__{we cut to the shell shocked brothers, and the almost completely built weapon.}
<C>__{btt }
<D>__{and just like a prick, you are having second thoughts; you're shrinking, and your little balls are shrinking with you.}
<A>__{they stare on. the brothers have lost this one and they know it. they start to reverse. btt lets the odd chicken cluck out the corner of his mouth, vinny misses his step and waves his gun about in a futile effort to look mean. they back away into the corridor down to the back door of the cafe.}
