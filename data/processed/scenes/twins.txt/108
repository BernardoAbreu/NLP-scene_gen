<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(gasping)}

<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{morris klane}
<A>__{he grabs vince again.}
<C>__{morris klane}
<D>__{you gotta understand something, benedict i like my work.}
<A>__{he pulls vince groggily up and this time he's going for vince's face. he takes his time setting vince up, getting his chin at just the right angle. he's concen trating on his work, so he doesn't pay much attention to the fact that the elevator door has opened behind. klane draws his fist back and is about to drive it into vince's face when he suddenly pauses; the expression on his face, at first puzzled, becomes increasingly agonized as we reveal that }
<B>__{julius}
<A>__{behind him, is squeezing a pressure point on klane's neck, rendering him unable to punch out vince. julius maneuvers the klane off of vince and forces him down onto the floor.}
<C>__{julius}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{these are most unfriendly acts you are committing.}
<C>__{morris klane}
<P>__{(totally surprised)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{i don't know what the problem is, but i'm sure it can be solved without resorting to violence.}
<C>__{morris klane}
<P>__{(absolutely in agreement)}
<D>__{okay, okay.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{julius lets go of klane, who gets to his feet, turns around, and instantly lets fly with his fist at julius's face. here julius effortlessly blocks the punch and goes right on talking.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{you moved too soon.}
<A>__{klane spins and aims a karate kick at julius's head. julius coolly ducks it and sends klane crashing into a wall.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{an important rule in a crisis situation negotiate first, attack last. you never negotiated. you don't know what kind of enemy i am.}

<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(happily)}

<A>__{klane isn't buying it. seeing a fire axe inside a glass case on the wall, he smashes through and grabs it.}
<C>__{morris klane}
<D>__{you're firewood.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{you have no respect for logic }
<A>__{klane charges julius, who sidesteps his blow. the axe is is imbedded in the wall. as julius grabs him.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{ and i have no respect for those with no respect for logic. you're a very stupid person.}
