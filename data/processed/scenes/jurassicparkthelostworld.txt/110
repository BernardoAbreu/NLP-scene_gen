<L>__{exterior main street night}
<A>__{with roland and ludlow gone on the hunt and the rest of the group inside the operations building, main street stands deserted and silent. nearly deserted, anyway. moonlight shadows lengthen at one end of the street and five velociraptors stroll into town.}

<L>__{exterior valley of death night}
<A>__{roland and ludlow are back in the valley of death, standing amid the giant skeletons of long dead animals. roland bends down, checking the carcass of the freshly chewed hadrosaur he saw earlier. a set of giant three toed rex tracks leads away from the carcass, down the stream bed. roland follows them. ludlow follows roland. as they near a bend in the stream, roland looks down, at the surface of the water. a pattern of ripples moves toward them, washing over their ankles. roland follows the ripples with his eyes. from up head, around the bend, he can hear the sound of an animal eating and drinking. a very large animal. he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a pinch of the ashes from the cooking fire that he scooped up earlier and releases that on the wind. they float there for a second, suspended, then blow back at him.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{we're downwind. good.}
<A>__{roland darts a contemptuous look at him. he puts a finger to his lips, gesturing for silence, then steps up, onto the shore. ludlow follows. they creep forward, toward the sounds. they round the bend and roland hits his belly, edging up over a small rise. over the rise, he sees the tyrannosaur, about a hundred yards ahead. it's stooped over the stream bed, drinking. like a bird, it dips its head in the water and then straightens up, to let the water fall down its throat. a dozen compys are at the water as well, drinking. roland gently flicks the safety on his gun to "off." ludlow edges toward the cover of a low hanging branch. as he puts his weight on one knee, it presses down hard on the middle of a small stick, which cracks in half. roland turns, eyes blazing. out in the open, the tyrannosaur snaps its head sharply as well, staring in the direction of the sound. but since roland's own head is turned, he doesn't see the dinosaur's reaction. roland holds a warning finger out to ludlow. roland turns his head back. the tyrannosaur is gone. further on, the trail of three toed tyrannosaur footprints stops abruptly. roland stops too, gesturing for ludlow to freeze behind him. roland glances both ways, looking for any sign of the track. to the right, the ground gives way to hard black volcanic rock. a short distance behind them, the rock is solid, a massive, green, pebbled boulder ten feet high. roland frowns and whispers in ludlow's ear again.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{we took to the rock.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{in front of roland, a palm frond sways gently in the night breeze. roland's eyes widen. he pulls out another pinch of campfire ash and releases it on the wind. this time, the ash blows off, straight away from him.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{wind shift.}
<A>__{they freeze, terrified. behind them, the enormous green pebbled boulder opens an eye. that's no boulder, that's the male tyrannosaur, standing rock solid still, its natural camouflage blending into the surrounding foliage perfectly. very slowly and almost silently, the rex brings its head all the way around until it is staring directly down at them from about ten feet away. roland and ludlow stand frozen, their back to the rex, unaware of its presence. until it exhales. the soft snort of its breath isn't quite audible, but it brushes the hair on the backs of their necks ever so slightly. their hearts drop into their stomachs. ludlow speaks, his voice a queasy hiss.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{it's... behind... us.}
<C>__{roland}
<P>__{(the very softest whisper)}
<D>__{it's just fed. it won't attack unless it's threatened. don't move.}
<A>__{as the rex silently cocks its head, sizing up the danger from these intruders, it breathes again. a few strands of ludlow's hair flap in the exhalation. he closes his eyes, near tears. he can't take it. his eyes dart, glancing down at the weapon he holds in his hands. unfortunately, it's extended in front of him, away from the rex. he risks another hiss.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{if i don't move, i can't shoot it.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{let it go, peter. the animal won.}
<A>__{behind them, the rex appears satisfied. it starts to swing its massive head around, back toward the jungle. it lifts one great leg and takes a step into the trees. roland signs and closes his eyes, relieved. but ludlow seizes the opportunity. he whips his weapon around and drops to one knee.}
<C>__{roland }
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{the rex is infinitely quicker. ludlow just has time to squeeze off a short burst of semi automatic gunfire when the animal whirls, takes one elegant step forward, and pounces. ludlow's bullets rip harmlessly through the foliage between the rex's legs as its big head snaps forward and comes down, jaws wide. they close around ludlow's body, lift his straight up into the air, and toss him once, readjusting their grip so it is firmly around his midsection. the whole combination of movements takes but half a second. by the time roland turns around, the animal has pivoted and darted back into the jungle, carrying ludlow, still screaming and writhing in its mouth. roland raises his gun, to draw a bead on the animal, but through the shivering trees, he can only see that the tyrannosaur is gone.}
