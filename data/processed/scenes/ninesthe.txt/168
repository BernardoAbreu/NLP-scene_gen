<L>__{exterior manhattan sidewalk day}
<A>__{we move with gavin as he walks. he's trying to get away from the camera, but it keeps following him. he reaches a crosswalk. he has to wait for the light. finally, he looks into camera:}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{look, i don't want to do this anymore. my show's not going to happen, so this show is over.}
<C>__{gavin }
<D>__{done. gone. i`m not going to be your fucking puppet. off screen voice are you alright?}
<A>__{gavin looks left, where an african american woman is waiting for the same crosswalk. (we recognize her as octavia, the streetwalker from part one.)}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<C>__{octavia}
<D>__{who were you talking to?}
<A>__{gavin looks back towards camera, a strange expression.}
<B>__{much wider}
<A>__{we see gavin and the woman on the corner. there's no camera gavin could have been talking to. he's understandably perplexed: where did the documentary crew go? was there ever anyone there? our camera style has changed: instead of handheld and jerky, we're smooth and slow. the music has completely changed, underscoring a sense of creeping dread. we hold for a long beat. the light changes. still a little unnerved, octavia begins to cross the street. only then do we notice something unusual floating above her head:}
<B>__{a sphere of blue light.}
<A>__{wider, we see that everyone on the street has the same kind of sphere floating a foot above their heads. no one seems to see the lights other than gavin. gavin looks around in uneasy fascination, as if he's just landed on an alien world. a beat, then he has an unsettling thought. he slowly looks up. above his own head, he sees the same sphere of light only his is bright white. pulsing. blinding.}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{oh god.}
<A>__{we pull back, rising up to a perspective above and behind gavin. as we do, the edges of the frame creep in, revealing icons and unintelligible statistics, changing moment by moment. a dialog box appears in the center of the screen, reading...}
<D>__{exit now? unsaved changes will be lost. [ cancel ] [ exit ]}
<A>__{an arrow slides back and forth between to the two options. finally it lands on `exit.'}
<B>__{a click.}
