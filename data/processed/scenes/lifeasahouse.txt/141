<A>__{a city inspector's truck pulls to a stop and bob larsen steps out with a clipboard and a concerned look on his face. george is dozing on drugs.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{you're not a plumber, kurt.}
<A>__{kurt finishes hooking in a plugged tee at a turn and stands.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{i worked every summer with my dad. check out what i've done.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{it's not whether it's good or bad. you know that. it's whether your licensed.}
<A>__{frustrated, kurt glances around at all his good work before answering.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{are you still renting that illegal non conforming studio under your house for a thousand a month?}
<A>__{bob opens his clipboard and checks a number of items off.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{okay. looks good to me.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{oh, that's embarrassing. that was too easy. at least look around. i really did do it right.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{that isn't why i'm here, anyway.}
<A>__{george wakes up and quickly hones in on bob.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i've been dreading you.}
<A>__{bob walks toward george as he talks.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{mr. stevens. one of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height. he's filed to have construction stopped immediately.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it's thirty feet.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{well, if it is, we have a problem.}
<A>__{george stands, he appears slightly shaky.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i have the permit.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{after your last extension request and with design review and the board of adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{to the patio and one north facing window...}
<P>__{(suddenly realizing)}
<D>__{and six inches to the height.}
<A>__{george sits back down. everyone emerges from the house to join george and bob.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{david dokos?}
<A>__{bob nods.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i don't let him. he just loves to.}
<C>__{colleen}
<D>__{he'll make you tear the entire roof off rather than give you any satisfaction.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i'm afraid you won't be able to continue until this is settled. you can always go back and file an appeal.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{that would take weeks.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{months.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{just so you know, we'll be here working tomorrow and every day after until this house is finished.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{he'll call us again and then he'll call the police. he has an attorney on retainer.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{just so you know.}
<A>__{robin turns and walks back into the house. colleen, alyssa, adam and ryan soon follow.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{if he hears a hammer, he'll have you arrested.}
<A>__{robin picks up the hammer and pounds a nail into a piece of wallboard. dale, miguel, greg and kurt walk back to the house and go back to work. bob glances at george who shrugs.}
