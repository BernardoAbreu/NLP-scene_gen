<A>__{a clock alarm sounds over titles on black. we hear someone clearing congested lungs, coughing up phlegm; a slight crash stops both the cough and the alarm.}
<L>__{exterior george's beach shack morning}
<A>__{the cottage is a tiny, peeling paint rat trap set dead center on a small ocean front cul de sac, surrounded by four massive post modern mansions.}
<L>__{interior george's beach shack bedroom morning}
<A>__{george nelson, 42, squints and shivers as the spotty morning light and ocean breeze enter through an open window. bold waves crash against the cliffs outside the room. a five foot wide stack of hand hewed beams are piled pyramid style, making movement in the room next to impossible. george stands shirtless in underwear and coughs again. he steps over a pile of tools and stands at the window, facing the sea. a happy sounding tune by guster, "what you wish for," begins with the lyrics: 'woke up today, to everything gray and all that i saw just keeps going on and on...'}
<L>__{exterior webber's house morning}
<A>__{the post modern house is three levels of concrete and glass.}
<L>__{interior sam webber's bedroom morning}
<A>__{sam is sixteen with spiky black hair, a nose ring, two earrings and painted black nails. the song continues with: '...sweep all the pieces under the bed, close all the curtains and cover my head.' sam looks wasted as he climbs out of bed and rummages through his dresser, retrieving an empty bottle of prescription drugs; he tosses the bottle. he walks to a desk where a half built model of a house sits unfinished and squeezes glue into a plastic bag and sniffs it. sam enters the closet and digs into a pile of dirty clothes, pulling out the tie to a robe; he knots it around the closet pole and then twists it once to form a noose. he slips his neck through the noose and lowers his body; though we don't see exactly what he's doing below his neck, it's evident through his jerking arm that he's masturbating.}
<L>__{exterior beck's ocean front mansion morning}
<A>__{colleen beck, george's next door neighbor, is a well maintained blonde in her late thirties. she walks out of the angular concrete mansion, grabs the paper and walks back in.}
<L>__{interior beck's kitchen morning}
<A>__{this is a minimalist kitchen, with pored concrete walls and stainless steel cabinets. colleen drops the paper on the table and walks to the sink to wash her hands. the song continues: '...if this serenade is not what you want, it's just how it is...' colleen appears distracted for a moment. she walks outside onto the terrace with wet hands, then bolts back in, breezing through the kitchen with purpose.}
<L>__{interior alyssa beck's bathroom morning}
<A>__{alyssa is sixteen and perfect with strawberry blonde hair and white teeth; her head is partially out the bathroom window. colleen bursts in, eases alyssa aside and with effort, sticks her head out of the same high open window.}
<C>__{colleen}
<D>__{this is ridiculous!}
<A>__{we must not see exactly what they see, but out the window and almost beyond view, a stream of urine arks out from george nelson's beach house bedroom, into the pacific ocean some twenty feet below. the piss stops. colleen bangs her head trying to get it back inside the house.}

<A>__{robin webber is george's ex wife, still beautiful at forty. she herds two boys, ryan (8) and adam (7), down the hall.}

<C>__{robin}
<D>__{sam?!}
<L>__{interior sam's webber's closet morning}
<A>__{the closet pole and a long line of clothes have been felled by sam's dangerous whack off technique; he's on the floor with the robe tie still around his neck and a pile of shirts sprawled over him. the song continues: '...come out come out, wherever you are, would you do it all over right from the start, and what you wish for won't come true, you aren't surprised to love, are you?' robin stops at the door, trying to figure out why her son is sitting in a pile of his own clothes. ryan and adam join her, looking equally perplexed.}
<L>__{exterior george nelson's cul de sac morning}
<A>__{george's dog, guster, is doing his business on the lawn of a modern day robber baron, david dokos, who exits his house with a briefcase. he hops into his mercedes and proceeds to chase guster straight across his well manicured grass. guster easily escapes death and runs off. george walks out of his shack as david hops the curb, flips him off and drives away. george waves goodbye.}

<D>__{stick it up your ass! have a nice day.}

<D>__{there are no windows facing my...exposure.}
<C>__{colleen}
<D>__{george, this is the third time.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{the plumber's due out on friday.}
<C>__{colleen}
<D>__{you'll have to explain that to the police.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you were the only neighbor i could tolerate.}
<C>__{colleen}
<D>__{i did warn you.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{my life is a warning. i just can't figure out for what.}
<A>__{colleen shies away from george's stare; he finally turns and walks toward the house but stops short as he turns back.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{colleen, how hard was it for you to get your head outside that window far enough to see my dick?}
<A>__{this stops colleen for a moment; it was difficult. george walks back to the cottage and locks guster in before stepping into an old ford truck and driving off. colleen watches him drive off, then turns to her house and stares.}
<L>__{interior webber's dining room morning}

<L>__{interior commuter train morning}
<A>__{george is resting his head against the glass window as he stares out at the blighted landscape leading to downtown los angeles. a sudden pang tightens his face; he presses his hand against his stomach and closes his eyes.}
<L>__{exterior laguna beach high school morning}
<A>__{sam is alone at the back of the parking lot, sitting on the hood of an old saab, smoking as two boys, josh and marek, both seventeen, park a porsche and pull alyssa beck (george's peeping neighbor) and another girl out of the backseat.}
<C>__{marek}
<D>__{dude, nice look.}
<A>__{sam simply nods as marek and the other girl laugh at his all black garb, earrings and eye shadow.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i saw your dad this morning.}
<A>__{sam drops his cigarette and stomps it out as he stands; his face lightens as alyssa waves before walking away.}

<L>__{interior downtown los angeles highrise late morning}
<A>__{the architectural firm of benson and feinsilber occupies the entire fortieth floor; george nelson is their sole model maker. rather than offices, most of the space is open, segmented only by portable low walls. along the outer walls, below the long line of windows, is a shelf filled with amazingly intricate models. george is alone in a cubicle of his own, cutting polystyrene with a hot wire. steven gardner rounds a corner with a velocity that makes george flinch.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{done...close to done?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i'm doing the grass.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{fuck the grass. who said grass?}

<D>__{i was going to start monday.}

<A>__{george simply stares as steven nods and leaves.}
<L>__{exterior high school cafeteria atrium lunchtime}
<A>__{sam is by himself, his eyes closed, listening to music through headphones as alyssa stops to stare; she visually scans him head to foot, appearing slightly perplexed as a friend passes.}
<C>__{friend}
<D>__{i wouldn't make a habit of it.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{the friend walks on; after a beat, alyssa does too.}
<L>__{exterior top of the world park evening}
<A>__{in the distance, the sun colors the sky a blinding orange as it sets. a range rover with blackened windows is parked behind a porsche. 'tinted windows,' an up tempo tune with a hand clapping by the pansy division, begins: 'a bed would be a treat but all we've got is this backseat tinted windows are a beautiful thing.' through the front windshield, we can see marek sitting in the passenger's seat with his eyes closed.}
<B>__{another view}
<A>__{josh, marek's friend, is sitting on a bench in the park behind the cars. 'a dark secluded spot in a deserted parking lot tinted windows are a wonderful thing.' suddenly, the passenger door on the rover opens and marek climbs out, brushing his hair with his hands before casually checking his zipper. he closes the door and the car speeds away. josh walks to marek and wordlessly they climb into the porsche and drive off.}
<L>__{exterior george nelson's beach shack day}
<A>__{george is shirtless in his front yard, hand hewing a twenty foot beam. one strong, long pull and a thin shaving flutters to the ground; guster nabs it and starts to chew.}

<A>__{guster appears unconcerned as he awaits a new shaving.}
<C>__{alyssa }

<C>__{george}

<D>__{no.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{marilyn manson...and i guess he's into guys. i hate nose rings. and the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.}
<A>__{george is totally confused, unsure most of the answer, but before he can question her, a police car pulls to a stop; officer kurt walker steps out.}

<D>__{i wouldn't want you as a friend.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{george just never really...aimed that high. even with not hitting a rabbit. i knew you were doing that, by the way. that's why i stopped doing it with you. you were no fun. it was always like you were frightened. quiet and boring.}

<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{he builds models for architects. his dad, on the other hand, was the real deal. designed and built the coolest houses i've ever seen.}

<D>__{do you know what i'd give to have this! forget how i got it! i can't afford dirt in this town. i live in riverside, goddammitt and you get to piss in the ocean.}

<C>__{george}
<D>__{i built my first model here when i was twenty. there are hundreds of them on shelves around the office. twenty years of my life. i was wondering if i might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home? only the ones that really mean something to me.}
<A>__{bryan recoils slightly from the request.}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{oh, well...those are...i mean, we don't get to keep our work. i could maybe ask them if you could choose one. but, you know, frankly george, you were the best. computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours. they're a part of this firm. they inspire me. i go out there and sometimes just stare at something i've designed. it amazes me. i would miss that too much.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{look, i may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but i'm sure it'll be okay.}

'pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind, possessing them, caressing me...' george drops face first to the cement, crushing the model beneath him.}
<B>__{montage as the song continues}
<A>__{george is probed and poked by doctor after doctor. an ultrasound test followed by a ct scan, followed by a mri results in more tests. a flexible tube is slid down george's throat as dye is shot into his body. 'sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open view, inciting them, inviting me...' a long blunt needle is shoved into george's side for a biopsy of his pancreas. x rays are lit and highlighted as doctors ponder the specks, the disease. finally, george is opened up; nearly bloodless slice through skin, muscle and fat reveals death. 'limitless undying love, which shines around me like a million suns, which calls me on and on across the universe...' george is wheeled down a long hall to the critical care unit. 'nothing's going to change my world, nothing's gonna change my world...'}

'he said to only look up, he said to never look down, down is where we came from...' it's an odd song sung in a happy tempo; a whistling refrain overtakes the lyrics as josh inhales. 'he said to hope for the best and take a load off my chest. soon, i could be happy, and go all the way up to heaven and go all the way back home.' with the music loud, josh misses the police car as it stops behind him without the lights. too late for a getaway, he fumbles for his cell phone and tosses the joint out the open window. the officer approaches the porsche with his hand on his gun.}

<A>__{as the music stops, the door to the mercedes opens and sam hops out with his pants around his ankles. the officer notices and walks towards the mercedes. the parking lights flash red as the car starts and flees the scene. sam yanks up his pants and leaps down the hillside, falling and rolling in the brush as the officer yells for him to stop. josh starts his car, but the officer dissuades him from leaving by removing his gun. josh turns off the engine.}

<A>__{sam is spotted with weeds and dirt as he continues his way down the steep hillside holding up his pants. after he's sure he's safe, he sits down and rests his head in his hands. he starts to shake, frightened by his actions. he drops onto his back, buttons and zips his pants as he starts to cry. slowly, he stops crying, but keeps staring up at the sky, which is loaded with stars and a full moon. mesmerized by the brilliant night, sam can't stop staring.}

<C>__{george}
<D>__{good morning.}
<A>__{robin and george set the beam down and turn to sam as they both wipe sweat off their faces. sam chews his sandwich, ignoring them both.}

<D>__{no! oh my god!}
<A>__{george jerk starts the chain saw again and fashions a small opening above the toilet, ripping through the studs, wire mesh, tar paper and stucco fine dust invades the space like a storm. bob coughs as he writes in his book. george kills the chain saw and sets it down as he surveys his work.}

<D>__{i always thought of myself as a house. i was always what i lived in. it didn't need to be big. it didn't even need to be beautiful. i just needed to be mine. i became what i was meant to be. i built myself a life. i built myself a house.}
