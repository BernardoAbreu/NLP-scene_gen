<L>__{exterior plains of west texas long shot dusk}
<A>__{a nehi orange sun pours itself into the grape ade davis mountains. pan along the horizon past nothing but open spaces ... then a red neon sign, small and broken down, like the spit grill diner it advertises. the stolen station wagon sits alone beside the pressed dirt parking lot of dottie's cafe.}
<L>__{interior dottie's cafe dusk}
<A>__{a skinny, small town waitress checks her face in a bathroom mirror. she applies too much lipstick and pinches her cheeks before exiting. we follow as she exits the kitchen bathroom door, grabs two already prepared hamburger platter specials from beside the grill and moves through a swinging door into the diner. a counter, three booths, grease everywhere... she sets the two plates in front of butch and phillip at a booth. butch digs in but phillip holds for a beat. butch notices and stops chewing while phillip says "grace".}

<P>__{(quiet as a mouse)}
<D>__{thankyew, father, for yer' 'boundiful' nature and goodness.}

<C>__{eileen }
<D>__{he leaves at four. not much traffic after lunch.}
<A>__{she brazenly stares a hole through butch as she lifts a slice of pickle off his plate, places it in her mouth and slowly chews. phillip, mouth full, takes note of the confusing spectacle. eileen turns to walk away.}
<C>__{eileen}
<D>__{if you need me, i will be right over here.}
<A>__{she slowly sashays away to behind the counter. butch watches her every step. phillip chews and watches butch's eyes. butch turns his head and catches phillip watching him.}

<D>__{eat yer' food.}
