<L>__{interior adam's kitchen later that night}
<A>__{adam holds out a tray of wheat grass as he prepares to blend wheat grass shots.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{you ever had this stuff.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{no, but it's supposed to be really good for you.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{well it smells like my grandmother.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{you complain a lot.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{you haven't met my mother. it's a miracle i do anything but complain.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{i try not to look at the world like that.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{the world would be a boring place if we didn't complain. come on. there's got to be something. one thing, just one thing, that drives you nuts.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{hmmm.}
<P>__{(fishing)}
<D>__{i really don't like it when people at work finish all the coffee and don't refill the pot.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{it's infuriating right?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{i wouldn't say infuriating. it's just not good work place etiquette.}
<A>__{adam is far more excited by this revelation. he hands katie a shot of wheat grass and takes one last sniff of the awful smelling drink. he raises his glass to make a toast.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{to complaining.}
<A>__{adam downs the drink and cringes at the taste. katie follows, and in total disgust, she spits her wheat grass all over adam's face.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{oh god, that's disgusting. i'm so sorry.}
<A>__{katie grabs a towel as adam stands speechless.}
<C>__{katie }
<D>__{hold on. i'm so sorry.}
<A>__{adam keeps his eyes closed as katie wipes his face.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{is it all gone?}
<A>__{for the first time, katie notices how cute adam is. adam opens his eyes to catch katie staring at him. they lock eyes for a moment. uncomfortable, adam averts his look. suddenly, rachel walks through the front door.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{adam?}
<A>__{feeling a little foolish, katie motions to leave.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{i should probably be going.}
<A>__{rachel enters the kitchen.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{adam?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{finally. where have you been?}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(mad)}
<D>__{i hope i'm not interrupting.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{oh, this is dr. mcrae, my therapist.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(suspicious)}
<D>__{this is your therapist?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{please, call me katie.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(suspicious)}
<D>__{ok. katie. what are you doing here?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{she drove me home. ring a bell?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{ugh. shit.}
<P>__{(sweet nervous)}
<D>__{thank you so much for doing that. life's been a little crazy lately, which i'm sure adam has told you all about. i love those shoes.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{thanks...}
<A>__{awkward silence. the tension is thick.}
<C>__{katie }
<D>__{i'm going to go. i will see you at our next session adam.}
<A>__{katie leaves.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{where have you been?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i was at the gallery.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(pissed)}
<D>__{you were supposed to pick me up. 8 hours ago.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i know. i'm sorry. i totally spaced. with the opening only three months away my head's just all over the place.}
<P>__{(off adam's look)}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{don't look at me like that. you know this is a hard time for me.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{you're right. let me go back and talk to the doctor see if maybe they can diagnose me with something that better suits your needs.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{i'm not just some car service here to shuttle you around!}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{and my house isn't a summer camp. you can't just come and go as you please and not take some responsibility.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{and what is it that i'm not taking responsibility for?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{this. us.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i can't handle this! you make it sound like i'm your wife.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{you know what i thought the other day? that i might actually die without ever having sex again.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i'm sorry if your cancer isn't turning me on.}
<A>__{rachel begins to cry.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{you think this is easy for me seeing you sick like this? the past few months have been hard on me too. it's not always about you.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(relents)}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{adam tenderly wraps his arms around rachel. a beat.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{why are you so good?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{you're my yam.}
