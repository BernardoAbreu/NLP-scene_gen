<L>__{exterior house day}
<A>__{the driver jumps out of the car. as he rushes to the front door, we see the urgent package he is delivering.}
<B>__{two large pizzas}
<A>__{before he can ring the bell, the door opens and two smug 15 year olds stare out.}
<D>__{15 year old that's 34 minutes. you're 4 minutes late. pizza's free.}
<A>__{reveal our guy staring back at the kids. this is will (25), probably good looking in another life. right now, he is tired and unamused, wearing a red "giorgio's trattoria" hat and a sweaty matching t shirt.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{gimme a break. you guys live two towns away. it's pretty much fucking impossible to get here in 30 minutes. other 15 year old exactly. that's why we ordered from your shitty "trattoria."}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{this is gonna come out of my paycheck. you sure you don't want to take the moral high ground? other 15 year old we'd rather take the pizzas.}
<A>__{will takes a calming breath. hands over the pizzas.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{ok. you guys are pretty smart. you figured out a way to beat the system.}
<P>__{(peeks inside)}
<D>__{got the house to yourselves? 15 year old that's right.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{not bad. any jailbait in there? little pizza and a rainbow party?}
<A>__{the kids shakes their heads.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{seriously? well, two hustlers like yourselves gotta have the place stocked with beer and whippits and shit, right? just call the girls up and let them know the party's on. 15 year old man, we don't have any of that stuff.}
<A>__{will makes a show of mulling this over.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i really shouldn't do this...but you seem like a couple of good dudes. i will tell you what, you give me the money that your mom left you for the pizzas, and i will grab you some beers.}
<C>__{will }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but i get to keep the change as a tip. deal?}
<A>__{the kids look at each other. one hesitantly pulls out some cash. will snatches it and heads off.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i will see you in like 20 minutes.}
<A>__{the kids look uncertain. as if sensing this, will stops before getting into his ride.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you boys like budweiser, right? 15 year old uh, yeah, totally. other 15 year old love that shit!}
