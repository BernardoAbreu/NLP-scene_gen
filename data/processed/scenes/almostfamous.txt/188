<L>__{interior jann wenner's office day}
<A>__{william sits. editors are feverishly discussing the next issue. the big concerns of a national magazine are in the air. everyone is focused and quick. the conversation is machine gun like. jann werner turns to the kid.}
<C>__{jann}
<D>__{we can't run this piece.}
<A>__{the kid's eyes travel to his story a stack of fuzzy looking sheets on the table.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you obviously saw more than you wrote about. after eight days on the road with these guys.}
<C>__{david felton}
<D>__{didn't anything happen?}
<C>__{jann}
<D>__{and where are you in this piece? what did you want to write? because this reads like what they wanted you to write.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what happened to your highly touted think piece on limitations of a middle level band in the face of success?}
<A>__{william sits speechless. it's sinking in. failure. conversation continues at a fast pace:}
<C>__{jann}
<D>__{we can push up chet's who cover }
<C>__{fact checker}
<D>__{good 'cause it's going to take me three days to get through this research. it's all handwritten, on little slips. plus, they all refer to woman as "chicks." i mean, as a woman i have a problem with that. i know it's a side issue.}
<C>__{david felton}
<P>__{(sympathetic, loquacious)}
<D>__{it's a "puff piece." you fell for 'em. it happens. a relationship forms. you want them to like you.}
<P>__{(wistful, chewing cigarette holder)}
<D>__{happened with me and charlie manson. he was a very charming... lively... charismatic...}
<A>__{felton catches himself swooning. the other are staring at him. he snaps out of it.}
<C>__{david felton }
<D>__{... mass murderer.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{please let me finish it. give me tonight to work on it.}
<C>__{fact checker}
<D>__{chet's piece is all fact checked and ready.}
<C>__{jann}
<P>__{(to william)}
<D>__{get some sleep. we'll do another story sometime. we'll get you a kill fee.}
<C>__{fact checker}
<D>__{his research is all on little bits of paper.}
<A>__{did i say that?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{ben. you told me to send what i had. it's not finished.}
<C>__{fact checker}
<D>__{that's being charitable.}
<A>__{ben looks at the kid, then at jann. jann scans the kid's face for a beat, nods.}
<C>__{jann}
<D>__{let him use the big office. it's where hunter used to write.}
<A>__{william rises, gratefully. he shakes jann's hand.}
<C>__{fact checker}
