<L>__{interior city room the enquirer night }
<A>__{the party (previously shown in the bernstein sequence). we start this sequence toward the end of the former one, but from a fresh angle, holding on leland, who is at the end of the table. kane is heard off, making a speech.}
<C>__{kane's voice}
<D>__{not one of you has been hired because of his loyalty. it's your talent i'm interested in. that talent that's going to make the "enquirer" the kind of paper i want the best newspaper in the world!}
<A>__{applause. during above, bernstein has come to leland's side.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{isn't it wonderful? such a party!}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{his tone causes bernstein to look at him.}
<C>__{kane's voice}
<D>__{however, i think you'll agree we've heard enough about newspapers and the newspaper business for one night.}
<A>__{the above speeches are heard under the following dialogue.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<P>__{(to leland)}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{mr. bernstein, these men who are now with the "enquirer" who were with the "chronicle" until yesterday weren't they just as devoted to the "chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to our kind of paper?}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{sure. they're like anybody else. they got work to do. they do it.}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{only they happen to be the best men in the business.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(finishing his speech)}
<D>__{there are other subjects in the world }
<A>__{kane whistles. the band and the chorus girls enter and hell breaks loose all around leland and bernstein.}
<C>__{leland}
<P>__{(after a minute)}
<D>__{do we stand for the same things that the "chronicle" stands for, mr. bernstein?}
<C>__{bernstein}
<P>__{(indignantly)}
<D>__{certainly not. so what's that got to do with it? mr. kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{probably. there's always a chance, of course, that they'll change mr. kane without his knowing it.}
<A>__{kane has come up to leland and bernstein. he sits down next to them, lighting a cigarette.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{well, gentlemen, are we going to war?}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{our readers are, anyway, i don't know about the rest of the country.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(enthusiastically)}
<D>__{it'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, brad. we'll cover it the way the "hickville gazette" covers the church social! the names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes }
<P>__{(gets excited)}
<D>__{i tell you, brad, i envy you.}
<P>__{(quoting)}
<D>__{by bradford leland, the "enquirer's" special correspondent at the front. i'm almost tempted }
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{but there is no front, charlie. there's a very doubtful civil war. besides, i don't want the job.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{all right, brad, all right you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to i'd want to.}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{hello, georgie.}
<A>__{georgie, a very handsome madam has walked into the picture, stands behind him. she leans over and speaks quietly in his ear.}
<C>__{georgie}
<D>__{is everything the way you want it, dear?}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{if everybody's having fun, that's the way i want it.}
<C>__{georgie}
<D>__{i've got some other little girls coming over }
<C>__{leland}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{charles, i tell you there is no war! there's a condition that should be remedied but between that and a }
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(seriously)}
<D>__{how would the "enquirer" look with no news about this non existent war with benton, pulitzer and heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{they do it only because you do!}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{and i do it because they do it, and they do it it's a vicious circle, isn't it?}
<P>__{(rises)}
<D>__{i'm going over to georgie's, brad you know, georgie, don't you?}
<A>__{leland nods.}
<C>__{georgie}
<P>__{(over kane's next lines)}
