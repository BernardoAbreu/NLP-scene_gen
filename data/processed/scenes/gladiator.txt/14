<L>__{exterior road sunset}
<A>__{maximus and marcus are now walking along a road through the dense forest. slaves follow behind them, leading their horses. both sides of the road are filled with the men of the felix regiment. as maximus and marcus pass, the battered and bloody soldiers drag themselves to their feet, raising their swords, paying silent homage.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{they honor you, caesar.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i don't think they're standing for me, maximus. they honor you.}
<A>__{just then commodus canters into view with his praetorian guard escort. he watches the army honor maximus with rank envy as he nears. he rides up to maximus and marcus.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{have i missed it?}
<A>__{he leaps from his horse.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{have i missed the battle?}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you've missed the war. we're done here.}
<A>__{commodus embraces him, awkward.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{father. congratulations. i shall sacrifice a thousand doves to honor your triumph.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{spare the doves and honor maximus, he won the battle.}
<A>__{commodus embraces maximus, even more awkward.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{general, rome salutes you and i embrace you as a brother.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{highness.}
<A>__{they walk, maximus still supporting marcus, as:}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{your spaniards seem invincible. may the gods favor the felix regiment now and always...}
<P>__{(to his father)}
<D>__{here, father, take my arm.}
<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(ignores this)}
<D>__{where's your sister?}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{she's at the camp. she had no desire to see the gore of the battlefield.}
<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{lucilla would eat every corpse here if it brought her one step closer to the throne.}
<A>__{maximus laughs.}
<C>__{maximus}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{caesar, you do the lady injustice.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{it's a foolish old cobra who doesn't recognize his own off spring...}
<P>__{(he suddenly stops, not feeling well)}
<D>__{i think... i should ride now.}
<A>__{maximus waves for marcus' horse. it is brought up. several soldiers carefully help the old man into the saddle. he is then tethered to the brace on his saddle. it is a slow, graceful and embarrassing ordeal for the emperor of rome. when at last he is strapped in, he looks to maximus.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{so much for the glory of rome.}
<A>__{without a word to his son, marcus nods and the horse is slowly lead away. commodus and maximus watch him go.}
<C>__{commodus}
<P>__{(neutral)}
<D>__{he's dying.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{poor old man.}
<C>__{maximus}
<P>__{(terse)}
<D>__{if you'll excuse me, highness.}
<A>__{he turns and stalks away.}
