<L>__{interior queen's tower day}
<A>__{the sorceress continue their battle. they change each other into various beasts. they fight, physically and magically. in the midst of chaos, the door opens. willow pokes in his head, reacting in fear. then sneaks around the wall of the room and makes a dash for the baby.}
<C>__{bavmorda}
<D>__{as above, so below! universe of evil, raziel! it conquers even you!}
<A>__{bavmorda hurls a final spell at raziel, crippling her, throwing her into a corner. bavmorda laughs and goes to the altar. the baby is gone. willow races toward the door with the baby. the door suddenly slams shut. bavmorda's voice roars out:}
<C>__{bavmorda}
<D>__{stop! bring back that child!!!}
<A>__{willow stops. he turns around. bavmorda towers over him, grotesque, monstrous, poised to destroy willow with her magic.}
<C>__{bavmorda}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i'm willow ufgood. i'm a magician.}
<A>__{bavmorda laughs. willopw slowly walks toward her. he digs into his pocket. takes out the last magic acorn.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i'm a great magician.}
<A>__{willow throws the acorn at bavmorda. her hand shoots out and catches it. the acron begins to turn her to stone, petrifying her hand, her wrist, her arm. willow backs away, feeling successful. but with intense con centration of her evil will, bavmorda fights off the acron's spell. it reverses: her arm, wrist and hand turn back to flesh. she crushes the acorn in her fingers and lets the dust fall to the floor.}
<C>__{bavmorda}
<D>__{is that the extent of your power?}
<A>__{willow stands there helplessly. thunder cracks and lightning flashes through the open ceiling above the altar.}
