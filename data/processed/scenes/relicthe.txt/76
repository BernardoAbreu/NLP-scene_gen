<L>__{interior stairwell sub basement day}
<A>__{they enter a dank stairwell with brick stairs. water drips on the walls.}
<C>__{deputy one}
<D>__{what is this? a dungeon?}
<A>__{jonathan looks uneasy, double wraps the dogs' leashes around his black gloved hands. the two deputies remove their 12 gauges from their shoulders. then they all follow the animals, descend down the inky stairwell.}
<L>__{interior security command center museum day}
<A>__{the place looks like the control room of a nuclear power plant. two security guards monitor a battery of closed circuit screens. d'agosta is now accompanied by the pompous head of security, ippolito. clearly ippolito feels d'agosta is pissing on his territory and he's trying to assert control.}
<C>__{ippolito}
<D>__{this huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, lieutenant. you'll just scare people off. i can handle the security behind scenes with this system. it's state of the art.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{the cops are non negotiable, ippolito. why don't you just tell me how this space station works.}
<C>__{ippolito}
<D>__{it's fool proof, basically. i designed this whole thing myself. every valuable object in the museum carries a small electronic chip. if anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{that's great if you're stopping a burglar. not our goal here. are there motion detectors?}
<C>__{ippolito}
<D>__{in every exhibition room. the museum's divided into five cells. the reception and exhibit are in cell five. we could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{that would leave one exit for hundreds of people. you'd be violating every fire regulation on the books. we'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells. one more question. i see a big hole. if this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?}
<C>__{ippolito}
<P>__{(snorts)}
<D>__{you don't know much about computers, lieutenant. there are safeguards built in. we have back up systems with redundancies. there's no way these computers can fail.}
