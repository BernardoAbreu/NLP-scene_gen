<A>__{... it becomes truly disgusting lumpy green mud.}
<C>__{julianne }
<D>__{i figure, what the hell. can it make me look worse?}
<A>__{follow the hand up as it slathers the shit across her face in great green dripping gobs. she's juggling the wall phone, trying to keep it mudless, as she assures digger...}

<A>__{throws them in the bathtub. fastidiousness a short suit.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{ricky wouldn't let her in the show.}
<A>__{reaches for her toothbrush, absently. all her attention is on the conversation and the hideous green face in the mirror.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i recall it differently, but we digress.}
<A>__{without looking, picks up a tube of hotel shampoo...}
<C>__{julianne}

<A>__{at the last second. she stops. we don't know why, because she's still never looked at the brush.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{question. what happens if you brush your teeth with shampoo?}
<A>__{turns on the tap. tries to scrub the toothbrush clean, and drops the phone into the green swamp, which spatters all over her front. euucch. she's stymied, agitated, circling the sink, leaning down to it...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{hold on. i'm coming in for you!}
<A>__{she sets the toothbrush down in her toiletries kit. decides to yank on the phone's cord, and the receiver springs out, bopping her in the face. she's so filthy at this point, she just wipes it clean on her nightshirt. tells digger...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{you okay? this is one of those problem phones.}
