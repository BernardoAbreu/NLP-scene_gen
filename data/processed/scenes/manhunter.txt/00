<C>__{graham}
<D>__{what else did you keep out of the papers?}

<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{last two like this we had, you caught.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{that was three years ago. and by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{that's not entirely true, will. it's the way you think.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way i think.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i came down here to get away from all that.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{you look all right now.}

<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{these are all dead, will.}
<B>__{pictures}
<A>__{if we expected gory crime photos, these are not them. two snapshots: a woman followed by three children and a duck carrying picnic items up a bank of a pond. a second family behind a birthday cake at a table. they're all smiling. close: graham looks at the pictures for a full twenty seconds. then he puts them down and looks along the beach. graham's pov: molly + kevin kevin lanky and tall at eleven hunkers down at the water's edge, 50 yards away examining something in the sand. molly suntanned, blonde and sensuous at thirty stands watching the two men, her hand on her hip. waves careen around her ankles. her body language openly states hostility. it's towards crawford.}
<C>__{graham }
<D>__{let's talk after dinner. stay and eat.}
<C>__{crawford }
<D>__{i will come back later. i got messages at the holiday inn to collect}
