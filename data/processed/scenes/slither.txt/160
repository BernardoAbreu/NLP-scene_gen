<A>__{bill looks at the diseased surrounding the grant home. they seem impossible to get through. bill eyes the house next door, maybe twenty five feet from the grants'. he makes sure no one's paying attention for a moment, and he darts across the street to a parked car. the diseased don't see him. bill gazes down the street beside him. the sun is just barely beginning to rise. they don't have much time to move in the darkness. bill makes a break for the house next door.}
