<A>__{the speech continues as we follow the progress of a tomahawk cartoon doing the rounds of the tory back benches from knee to knee. it is entitled, "where is britannia?" and shows an empty throne draped with the royal cloak.}
<C>__{disraeli }
<D>__{... but by a chain of traditions that have been cherished from generation to generation, because in them in our traditions are embodied all the laws which have enabled us to create the greatest empire of modern times...}
<A>__{during the above, the cartoon reaches the front benches and lands on the knees of the young, earnest stanley. as he frowns at the picture in front of him, disraeli winds up.}
<C>__{disraeli }
<D>__{... but, even though we have amassed great capital and even though we have established an industry with no parallel in the world, yet all these mighty creations are as nothing compared to the invisible customs that shape our lives. to those honorable gentlemen of the opposition who seek to destroy the essential elements of this country, i say let them remember: england cannot begin again.}
<A>__{during this peroration, we see disraeli for the first time. he is handsome, obviously jewish and wire thin, like dickens on slimfast. he dresses almost dandyishly but speaks with startling vigor; a combination of brilliance and cheek that is his key. to cheers from his back benchers, he sits. as he looks up, he catches the eye of his opposite on the liberal benches. gladstone is different in almost every respect; dour, dogged, heavy set and tall. they stare levelly for a second, then disraeli flashes a brilliant smile. stanley plops the cartoon on his lap.}
