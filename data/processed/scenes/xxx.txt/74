<L>__{interior yorgi's bedroom day}
<A>__{there are three strippers asleep in bed. yorgi is sitting at his computer in his underwear. he's hacked in to the czech police network.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{something bothers me about you, mr. xander cage...}
<A>__{he looks around a bit, doesn't find what he's looking for. he sits up, getting pissed.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{get kirill. now!}
<A>__{she heads out. yorgi goes to the bathroom, splashes water on his face. kirill enters, still half asleep.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{what's the problem?}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{i'm inside the police mainframe. do you see anything?}
<A>__{kirill studies the screen while yorgi pulls on clothes.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{i've searched their e mail. no funeral announcement, no obituary, no call to arms. nothing on the news, even. i swear i saw a cop get shot yesterday. how come no one is talking about it?}
<A>__{kirill looks back at the screen. nothing there.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{i also check the wire transfer. i follow the money back to it's source, but there is no source. it comes from nowhere. first they bring cia, then british sas, now maybe they plumb the lower depths. maybe now they send someone who looks like us. maybe someone like our houseguest mr. x.}
