<L>__{interior terminator factory day}
<A>__{this terminator assembly plant is an intricate, multi leveled clockwork maze of moving conveyors and industrial robotics. electronics and hydraulics are robotically soldered in place. steel presses stamp out terminator parts torsos, face plates, spinal columns, limbs. partially completed parts are moved by conveyor to assembly stations, where limbs and heads are joined to torsos, elaborate operations carried out by industrial robots, like the ones in present day factories. synthetic skin is sprayed over a metal endoskeleton in precise amounts, building up to create human features... this is a t 400. an industrial robot arm picks up a cpu from a dry ice container. the cpu features the distinctive, linked rectangles familiar from the earlier films. the arm lifts this gingerly to a terminator skeleton and inserts it into the steel skull, screwing a seal over the hole. the red eyes flicker to life, and the armature releases the terminator, which moves away under its own power. it removes a plasma weapon from a wall rack, moving past the dumbfounded marcus. the terminator joins a dozen identical robots, who ride on a treaded skynet tank with a plasma cannon and flamethrower. there are numerous tanks here, awaiting deployment.}
