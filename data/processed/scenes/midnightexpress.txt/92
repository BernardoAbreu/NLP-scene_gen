<D>__{he's got a gun!}
<A>__{billy firing shots off to distract them has climbed over the front seat, jams the cab into gear. it stalls! again he tries, and now shoots off. the cab roars past the roadblock. the cops and soldier, scattered by the shots, now scream at each other. they run. shots are fired. billy guns the cab down the road, flying. clouds of dust trail the cab. the tank starts to roll after it. full speed. the halftrack follows, the men riding it shouting. billy looks back, then looking ahead sees something. p.o.v a speck in the far distance. another roadblock. billy decides, then the cab swerves right off the road and jumps into the gently rolling field on the border of the road, pock marked with}
<B>__{hills.}
<A>__{the turks come roaring down the road, pointing to the cab. low angle the tank makes a flat out stop, gears grinding. the gun turret swings left. the cab in the far distance, at an angle to the tank, starts running up an incline.}
<B>__{the tank fires.}
<A>__{p.o.v. shell blasts wide of the cab. billy, startled, looks back, guns for the top of the incline. his p.o.v. another shell now blasts to his front right, closer. something heavy (shrapnel) thuds into the rood of the cab. billy drives all out. p.o.v. the incline closer, closer, about to make it, then: a blast tank p.o.v. the cab spinning in the blast of the adjacent shell burst. billy, shaken but unhurt, staggers out of the cab, looks: p.o.v. a wheel blasted away, fuel pissing out from the shrapnel holes, smashed windshield and fender. the turks are coming up the incline now, like the cavalry some on foot running, others on the halftrack. bullets whistle and pop nearby. billy running. he tears off his jacket. soldiers pass the wrecked car, at the top of the incline shouting, pointing and firing at billy in the distance. one soldier seems lighter than the others and takes off in a sprint as the others follow. the halftrack now crests the incline and gathering full gear and momentum, roars off down the slope after billy. close billy running sweat all over him. in background, the halftrack and running figures. billy runs into a high dry cornfield with the sun starting to set ahead of him in the greek mountains. mountains must make those mountains. billy running all out eyes fixed on them, breathing, skipping heartbeats. the personnel carrier bypasses the fast soldier who slows down, panting. billy has outrun him. other soldiers run up in the distance. billy, tireless, obsessed, runs right into a poppy field.it is a splendid beautiful scarlet red, set off by the dipping rays of the sun. his feet smashing down the poppy plants. fast thuck! thuck! thuck! thuck! thuck! thuck!}
