<L>__{interior ant bar entrance night}
<A>__{princess bala is peering in at the entrance to the ant bar, accompanied by her worried looking handmaidens.}
<D>__{handmaiden #2 we shouldn't be doing this it isn't proper!}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{i'm the princess, aren't i? handmaiden #2 of course }
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{and do princesses do improper things? handmaiden #2 of course not }
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{then if i go to the worker bar, it isn't improper. anyway, don't worry. no one will recognize us in our disguises.}
<A>__{she adjusts her "disguise", a hardhat, tied down jackie o. style with an ant's version of a chanel scarf.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{i'm just a common worker, cooling off after a rough day!}
<A>__{music starts. an ant barker takes the mic at one end of the dance floor.}
<C>__{barker}
<P>__{(on loudspeaker)}
<D>__{okay, folks. it's six fifteen, and that means it's time to dance.}
<A>__{every ant gets up to dance. weaver turns to z.}
<C>__{weaver}
<P>__{(draining his beer)}
<D>__{time to cut a rug, z!}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{i'm not in the mood.}
<P>__{(disgusted)}
<D>__{even when they're off work, they follow orders.}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{well, you just sit here and be a party pooper.}
<A>__{weaver joins the rest of the ants who are lining up for the dance. the barker calls out the steps in a bored monotone all the ants already know the steps. everyone dances in perfect synch.}
<C>__{barker}
<P>__{(southern twang)}
<D>__{and a left right quarterstep back step halfstep a left right quarterstep backstep halfstep a left right quarterstep backstep halfstep }
<A>__{at the entrance, bala smiles mischievously at her handmaidens.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{i'm going to ask one of these mindless, primitive worker types to dance with me! handmaiden #1 but general formica would be furious!}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(enjoying the idea)}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{the handmaidens are appalled. bala whirls away from them, sets her sights and searches the crowd zeroing in on z, who's watching the other ants dance.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{what a bunch of losers. mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system }
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{wanna dance?}
<A>__{bala's standing right there. z is instantly smitten.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{me?! yes!!! i mean }
<P>__{(regaining suavosity)}
<D>__{just let me finish my beer.}
<A>__{not breaking eye contact with bala, z smiles suavely. reaches suavely for a beer. suavely grabs the candle in a glass jar off the bar. suavely singes his face. he plays it off with a rakish little laugh. a bit apprehensive, bala heads onto the floor. z follows her.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{so uh how come i haven't seen you around here before?}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(covering up)}
<D>__{i work in the palace, i don't get out much.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{the palace, hunh? i bet those royals really live it up. of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding }
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(shocked)what?}
<A>__{z and bala step onto the dance floor with the rest of the ants, but z can't do any of the steps.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{now, let's see, i it's been a while since i i think you }
<A>__{bala watches z, trying to follow along. it's the blind leading the blind, as z tries in vain to follow the barker's rapid instructions.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{here, i will lead.}
<A>__{z starts doing his own, individual dance. with a suave expression on his face, he leads bala in a helter skelter mixture of tango, charleston, and hand jive.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{are you sure this is a real dance?}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{well, actually, uh i'm sort of making it up }
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{why should everyone dance the same way? it's as exciting as watching fungus grow.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{you're right!}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{you you think i'm right?}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{why can't i just do whatever i want to do? why can't i just go wild?! yahoo!}
<A>__{bala starts to get into it, making up her own steps in reply to z's, loosening up, having fun. for a moment, the two of them are actually sexy together. then they get a little too wild and the other ants, who are still doing their intricate dance, start to collide with bala and z. z almost knocks over a big soldier ant. we can only see the ant's back at the moment.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{hey! watch your step, worker.}
<A>__{z has turned around to see the soldier ant, major mandible, glaring at him. mandible is about twice z's size. he's got one eye missing, and half of his left antenna his been chewed off.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{you watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(terrified)}
<D>__{oh, that's okay, i will let him off this time.}
<P>__{(whispering to bala)}
<D>__{are you crazy? this guy's built like a pebble!}
<P>__{(ineptly trying to placate the soldier)}
<D>__{you know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays }
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?}
<A>__{z's caught between a rock and a hard place. he doesn't want to get beaten up, but on the other hand, he doesn't want to lose face in front of bala. more soldiers have gathered around, looking hostile.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{how come you don't dance like the rest of us?}
<A>__{z glances over at bala. then, shaking with nervousness, he says defiantly...}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{because because i'm an individual! soldier #2 an individual? never heard of it.}
<C>__{mandible}
<D>__{you look like a worker to me.}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{hey, lay off my little buddy!}
<A>__{z, meanwhile, looks far away, ecstatic, as if he's just realized something very important. unfortunately, just at this moment, a soldier pushes weaver...weaver pushes him back...somebody makes a dive for z and before you know it, there's a regular bar brawl going on, with weaver in the middle of it, cracking heads together, punching ants in the face, having a great time. just then, the princess' handmaidens hurries over.}
<D>__{handmaiden #1 princess bala! princess bala!}
<A>__{z, who's scrabbling around on the floor, overhears.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{princess? you're a princess? handmaiden #2 the police are coming!}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{uh oh.}
<P>__{(to z)}
<D>__{goodbye! gotta run!}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{wait! when can i see you again?}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{let me think. hmmnn...}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{never. bye!}
<A>__{bala rushes off with her handmaiden, just before a squad of whistle blowing police wade into the crowd.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{wait! princess! wait!}
<A>__{but she's already gone, leaving z holding her scarf.}
