<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{the gargoyle, still pinned to the wall by the firebird. a flash bounces off his skin. then another. he's being photographed. go wide and find him in the middle of a police investigation. bored blue uniforms, yellow barrier tape. the usual. a plain jane sedan pulls up and deposits thomas dagget, thirties, tweed coat and steel notebook. he smiles at a couple of cops, ducks under the yellow barrier, and nods a greeting to an older uniform sergeant, burrows.}
<C>__{thomas dagget}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{burrows}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{daggett}
<P>__{(looks up at sky)}
<D>__{thought those clouds this morning spelled rain for sure, but it's turned into a beautiful day, wouldn't you say, sergeant burrows?}
<A>__{thomas takes a deep, healthy breath. burrows just stares at him.}
<C>__{burrows}
<D>__{i warned you about that cheerful shit.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{sorry. i'm working on it.}
<A>__{he eyes finally make their way to the gargoyle.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{what's the word?}
<C>__{burrows}
<D>__{friend here did a half gainer with a firebird tuck from the third floor.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{jumper?}
<C>__{burrows}
<D>__{not unless he decided not to bother opening the window first.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{drugs? alcohol?}
<C>__{burrows}
<D>__{well, he wasn't exactly in a condition to walk a chalk line when we got here. you're welcome to try and smell his breath if you like, that is if you can find the mouth.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{ghouls been by?}
<C>__{burrows}
<D>__{on their way. willie promises a white paper tomorrow. or wednesday, depending on his golf game.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{firebird driver?}
<A>__{burrows nods in the direction of a very shook up young man sitting on the curb.}
<C>__{burrows}
<D>__{mr. jiminez. was taking a short cut to his job at a packing plant on san pedro. first thing he remembers about the deceased is several vital organs bouncing off his windshield.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{have you had him walk a chalk line?}
<C>__{burrows}
<D>__{he's straight. shook up some.}
<C>__{daggett}
<P>__{(looking at gargoyle)}
<D>__{anything on him?}
<C>__{burrows}
<D>__{no wallet, license, nothing. he is missing one or two things, though.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{like?}
<C>__{burrows}
<D>__{his eyes.}
<C>__{daggett}
<P>__{(looking at tangled mess)}
<D>__{along with everything else.}
<C>__{burrows}
<D>__{we've found everything else and what fun that was, let me tell you but the eyes are still awol. might just be stuck in the radiator grill. little weird though.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{burrows}
<D>__{both popping out together like that. worth a page in my scrapbook.}
