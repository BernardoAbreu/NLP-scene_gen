<A>__{a new family tree on a wall here, more complicated than the vanger's: the wennerstrom group, made up of dozens of companies in cities worldwide. as erika looks at it }
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{wennerstrom's swedish assets are genuine, but they're the only things that are. the rest is funneled through companies in gibraltar, colombia, and macao. these companies produce no products and provide no services. they're shells. they launder money from arms and drug sales, and crime syndicates in russia. and that money which accounts for all but 5 percent of his holdings ends up in accounts in the cayman islands. it's a completely illegal, criminal empire.}

<D>__{i could have gotten it from a source inside the company.}
<C>__{erika}
<D>__{but you didn't.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{but that's what you'll say.}
<C>__{erika}
<D>__{but what will you say to me?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{that depends on if you really want to know.}
<C>__{erika}
<D>__{i do. who gave you access?}
<A>__{what looks like 16 year old tattooed runaway lets herself in with her own key. crosses past erika with a paper bag, takes out two bagel sandwiches, the same kind blomkvist brought when he barged into her apartment. as she puts some water on for coffee, erika looks at blomkvist. he nods. yeah. her.}
