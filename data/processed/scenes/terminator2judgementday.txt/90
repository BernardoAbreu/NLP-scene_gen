<A>__{john is frantically pumping the kick start of his bike, scared shitless and the damned thing won't start. his hands are shaking so badly he can't find the choke. he looks up to see the t 1000 running down the corridor toward him. john fumbles with the choke. the bike catches. he slams it in gear and spins the bike out into the main aisle of the garage. john looks back... the t 1000 is behind him, running. he twists the throttle and guns the little bike forward. incredibly, the t 1000 is gaining. this nightmare isn't happening. john races out the exit ramp, and charges right into the street.}
