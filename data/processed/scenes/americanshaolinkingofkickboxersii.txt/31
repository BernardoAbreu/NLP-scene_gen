<L>__{interior temple same day}
<A>__{the monks are still chanting. drew stands there, listening some more, moving with the beat, until they stop chanting. drew, thinking it was some kind of performance, claps his hands.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{that was great! great!}
<A>__{the monks finally take notice of him, and they are shocked.}
<C>__{monk 1}
<D>__{no tourists! temple closed!}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{so you can see me?!?}
<A>__{several monks rush up and start herding drew towards the exit.}
<C>__{monk 1}
<P>__{(very agitated)}
<D>__{no tourists! no tourists!}
<A>__{drew stops their progress and makes sure he has the monk's attention.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{i'm not a tourist! i want to be a monk!}
<A>__{the monk stops, his face a mask of shock. he calls to another monk, and they have a short conversation in chinese.}
<C>__{admissions monk}
<D>__{that's not possible.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{what do you mean, sir?}
<C>__{admissions monk}
<D>__{the training is too difficult. besides, shaolin policy is no foreigners.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i didn't come all this way, from america, to get turned away. i want in. i want to become a shaolin monk.}
<C>__{admissions monk}

<C>__{monk}
<D>__{oh, yes, especially in this case.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i'm not leaving.}
<A>__{drew starts to sit down, intent on staying, almost like a kid who is going to hold his breath until he turns blue.}
<C>__{monk}
<D>__{you give me no choice.}
<P>__{(to other monks)}
<D>__{remove him.}
<A>__{he continues in a stream of chinese, and the other monks grab drew and physically force him to stand up and start moving him towards the door.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i just want to be a monk!}
<A>__{drew is forced through the courtyard to the front door. they pass the monk who was sweeping up in the back of the temple. he watches with interest as they open the door and force drew through it, out of the temple. he smiles.}
