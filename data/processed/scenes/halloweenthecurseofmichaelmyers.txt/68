<L>__{exterior haddonfield junior college parking lot morning}
<A>__{beth's car pulls into the parking lot of a picturesque, impeccably landscaped campus, speckled with colorful leaves. a buzz of excitement fills the autumn air. tim and beth are surprised to see a small crowd camped out in sleeping bags, holding "we love to hate harry" signs.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{yo, check it out. they've been lining up all night just to see harry.}
<P>__{(to kara)}
<D>__{you lose your mind in that thing, kara?}
<A>__{kara is nervously rifling through her enormous book bag.}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{i can't find my term paper.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{so copy someone else's. i do it all the time. works primo.}
<A>__{armed with her clipboard, beth is assailed by her committee. inundating her with questions.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{give us victory or give us death. see you tonight, kara!}
<A>__{tim and beth are swept away. a large sheet of paper falls out of kara's bag. she picks it up, startled by what she sees. kara's p.o.v. the drawing crayola figures of grandma, grandpa, uncle tim, and mommy. knives piercing them. blood dripping. mouths screaming. a black shadow figure bearing the word "thorn." on the flip side, the drawing she found last night. danny's scribbling of the odd triangular symbol.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{the horrifying images send chills up kara's spine.}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{thorn ...}
<A>__{lost in grim reverie, kara walks on, oblivious to the activity all around her ... a banner hangs from the eaves of the library: "haddonfield jr. college first annual harvest faire." tim and beth supervise as preparations for tonight's event get underway. student volunteers nailing together booths, hanging decorations. a half assembled ferris wheel, a merry go round, an ominous looking house of horrors. rounding the corner onto the quiet path behind the library, kara suddenly finds herself alone. wind whips at her hair. she glances over her shoulder, as if sensing a presence. kara's p.o.v. no one is there. just the rustling of leaves on the ground.}
<B>__{angle on kara}
<A>__{walking off in the distance. suddenly the shape steps shockingly into frame, watching her disappear around the corner.}
