<A>__{aloka huddled with manooj and amrita. hasari talking to the owner of a small market stall. shambu is peering into a shop with male mannequins in the window.}
<L>__{interior men's shop moving mirror}
<A>__{in the moving mirror we see counters and shelves of men's clothing. the mirror stops at max slipping into a kurta before an audience of ravi, manubai, and a salesman.}

<D>__{it's not extravagant at all. you can't go around all week in your tribal garb.}
<A>__{max sees a boy's face pressed to the glass: he indicates the shirt, for the boy's approval. the boy smiles a wonderful smile.}

<D>__{now he looks civilized, doesn't he, manubai?}
<C>__{manubai}
