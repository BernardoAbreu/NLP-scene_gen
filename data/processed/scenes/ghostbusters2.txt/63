<L>__{interior courtroom ghost battle day}
<A>__{everybody is silent now as the rumbling increases. all eyes turn to the exhibit table. then suddenly all hell breaks loose as two full torso apparitions explode out of the specimen jar.}
<B>__{judge}
<A>__{he looks up in terror at the two huge apparitions looming above him and recognizes them immediately.}
<C>__{judge}
<P>__{(in horror)}
<D>__{oh, my god! the scoleri brothers!}
<B>__{scoleri brothers}
<A>__{big in life, even bigger in death, the ghostly scoleri brothers seem ten feet tall. they are strapped into electric chairs and on their heads are metal electrocution caps with live, sparking electrical wires still attached. twenty five hundred volts of electricity shoot through their bodies as they start to break free of the leather restraints, trying to get at the judge.}
<B>__{judge}
<A>__{holding his gavel like a pitiful weapon, he crawls over to the defense table where venkman, stantz and spengler are now crouched, assessing the spectral intruders.}
<C>__{judge}
<P>__{(terrified)}
<D>__{you've got to do something!}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{who are they?}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{they're the scoleri brothers. i tried them for murder. they were electrocuted up at ossining in '48. now they want to kill me.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{maybe they just want to appeal.}
<B>__{scoleri brothers}
<A>__{they break loose from the electric chairs, then turn toward the defense table and blast it with high voltage finger lightning.}
<B>__{prosecutor}
<A>__{she sprints for the door, pursued by one of the scoleri brothers.}
<B>__{ghostbusters}
<A>__{they jump to safety behind the rail of the jury box, pulling the judge with them.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{these boys aren't playing around.}
<C>__{judge}
<P>__{(desperately)}
<D>__{you've got to stop them. please!}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(thinking like a lawyer)}
<D>__{violating a judicial restraining order could expose my clients to serious criminal penalties. as their attorney i'd have to advise them against it.}
<B>__{scoleri brothers}
<A>__{they start punching through the jury box.}
<B>__{judge}
<A>__{he is just about hysterical with fear.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{all right! all right! i'm recinding the order. case dismissed!!}
<P>__{(he pounds his gavel on the floor)}
<D>__{now do something!}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{let's go to work, boys.}
<A>__{with that, the ghostbusters leap over the rail of the jury box and dash across the courtroom to the exhibit table where their proton packs were being displayed as evidence. they strap them on hastily as the brothers continue tearing up the seats looing for the judge.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(slinging the pack onto his back)}
<D>__{geez, i forgot how heavy these things are.}
<C>__{stantz}
<P>__{(grabbing other gear)}
<D>__{okay, let's heat 'em up!}
<A>__{they flip the power switches on their packs and draw their particle throwers.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{all right, throwers. set for full neutronas on stream.}
<A>__{they switch on their throwers and turn to face the raging phantasms.}
<B>__{scoleri brothers}
<A>__{they are just about to wipe out the judge when a loud shout distracts them.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{hey! why don't you pick on someone your own size?}
<A>__{the towering ghosts turn in a fury and raise their arms, ready to shoot lightning at their new adversaries.}
<C>__{stantz}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{on my signal, boys. open 'em up now!}
<A>__{they all pull their triggers and the wands explode with incredible powerful streams of energy, doing even more damage to the courtroom.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{spengs, take the door. ray, let's try and work them down and into the corner.}
<A>__{working as a team, they gradually confine the scoleri brothers with the streams, forcing them closer and closer to the traps ray has set out on the floor.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{watch it! i'm coming under you, pete.}
<A>__{they circle around the two ghosts, prodding them with the streams while ducking the lightning bolts shooting from their fingers. finally, ray sees his chance and pops open the traps which emit inverted pyramids of light energy.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{steady watch your streams easy now venky, bring him left spengy, pull him down trapping trapping now!}
<A>__{he stomps on a control pedal and the scoleri brothers are drawn into the traps which snap shut.}
