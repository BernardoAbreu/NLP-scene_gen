"v" pulls the car off the boulevard into "tops" drive in. cars are lined up at the "to go" window and all along the side of the building where people are hanging out under a long metal awning. music is playing loud. "v" pulls into a parking spot by the awning. the headlights illuminate a group of hipsters some dancing, some just hanging out. three or four girls hanging out together turn toward "v's" car. they see pete in the front seat, and one of the girls, sheila, smiles and walks toward him.}
