<L>__{exterior beach day}
<A>__{on the other side, stan runs down to the beach and runs down the sand at full tilt, looking for any escape route. roberts has made up some time due to the auto pedestrian accident which slowed him down a little. stan however is faster. stan does his best jerry rice, as he runs down the beach at full speed. suddenly, the taurus comes tearing ass across the beach at stanley. stan veers, now running through the surf. the taurus veers as well, and stan is forced to slide across the hood to keep from getting whacked. the taurus breaks left, and slides further into the surf. the fbi driver hits the accelerator and bogs the taurus down, tires spinning, throwing sand. stan continues to run as roberts makes it to the taurus.}

<D>__{fuck this.}
<A>__{he pulls his .40 cal. from his shoulder holster and fires it into the air. roberts bends over trying to catch his breath. stanley stops, putting his hands up.}
<D>__{dark suit #2 why didn't you do that earlier, sir?}
<A>__{roberts looks at the agent.}
<D>__{dark suit #2 sorry, sir.}

<C>__{roberts}
<D>__{why were you running? we just wanted to talk.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{are you arresting me?}
<C>__{roberts}
<D>__{for violating your parole by leaving texas without permission or for evading a federal agent and almost getting me killed in the process?}
<A>__{stan just looks at him.}
<C>__{roberts}
<D>__{no, i'm not.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{then why are we talking?}
<C>__{roberts}

<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{roberts}
<D>__{you just want to cut through the pleasantries and get down to business? fine. i can help you with your daughter, stan. help me, i will help you.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{you'll have to forgive me, the fact that you put me in jail for 18 months doesn't inspire a lot of trust.}
<C>__{roberts}
<D>__{whether i agreed with what you did or not, you broke the law, stanley.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{i guess we were both doing what we had to. this was a nice trip down memory lane, but if you're not arresting me...}
<C>__{roberts}
<D>__{so, why was it you are in l.a. again?}

<D>__{i told you }
<C>__{roberts}
<D>__{ vacationing. that's right. ya know it's funny. axl torvalds was just here for a vacation, too. isn't it odd that the two best hackers in the world are here at the same time.}
