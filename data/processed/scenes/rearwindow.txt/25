<L>__{interior jeff's apartment day medium shot}
<A>__{jeff is seated in the foreground, in a waist shot. behind him, the entrance door to his apartment opens. stella mcgaffery comes in. she is a husky, unhandsome, dark haired woman who is dressed like a district nurse, with dark coat, dark felt hat, with a white uniform showing underneath the coat. she carries a small black bag. stella pauses on the landing to watch jeff. he doesn't appear to notice her entrance.}
<C>__{stella}
<P>__{(loud)}
<D>__{the new york state sentence for a peeping tom is six months in the workhouse!}
<A>__{he doesn't turn.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{hello stella.}
<A>__{as she comes down the stairs of the landing, holding on the wrought iron railing with one hand:}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{and there aren't any windows in the workhouse.}
<A>__{she puts her bag down on a table. it is worn, and looks as if it belongs more to a fighter than a nurse. she takes off her hat coat, and hangs them on a chair.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{years ago, they used to put out your eyes with a hot poker. is one of those bikini bombshells you always watch worth a hot poker?}
<A>__{he doesn't answer. she opens the bag, takes out some medical supplies: a thermometer, a stop watch, a bottle of rubbing oil, a can of powder, a towel. she talks as she works.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{we've grown to be a race of peeping toms. what people should do is stand outside their own houses and look in once in a while.}
<P>__{(she looks up at him)}
<D>__{what do you think of that for homespun philosophy?}
<A>__{a look at his face shows he doesn't think much of it.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{readers' digest, april, 1939.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{well, i only quote from the best.}
<A>__{she takes the thermometer out of its case, shakes it down. looks at it. satisfied, she walks to jeff. she swings the wheelchair around abruptly to face her.}
