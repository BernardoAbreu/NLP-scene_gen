<C>__{minister galgenstein}
<D>__{the king has determined to send the chevalier out of the country.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{when is he to go?}
<C>__{captain galgenstein}
<D>__{has he sent the challenge yet?}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{not yet, but i believe he intends to.}
<C>__{minister galgenstein}
<D>__{then this must be done tomorrow.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{what is to be done?}
<C>__{captain galgenstein}
<D>__{you say he drives after breakfast and before dinner. when he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{and his baggage?}
<C>__{captain galgenstein}
<D>__{oh! that will be sent after him. i have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn. you will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the chevalier's rooms until my arrival. we must force that box. you are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.}
