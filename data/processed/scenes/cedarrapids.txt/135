<D>__{i always wanna call you "friend!" sweet love showin' us a heavenly...}
<A>__{tim opens up the trunk. that's when we see: inside the trunk: orin, in his pajamas, bound and gagged by holiday inn bedsheets. his shouts are muffled by the gag. tim pulls orin from the trunk. orin's feet are tied together, so he has to hop as tim leads him toward the hog farm.}

<D>__{careful. it's super slippery.}
<A>__{orin falls face first into the muddy ditch.}

<D>__{i did a ton of research on hog farm risk mitigation. don't worry they might bite you a little if they think you're a food source. but there's never been a recorded hog bite death. so...}
<A>__{with great difficulty, tim picks up orin. then, he awkwardly hurls him over the barbed wire fence. orin lands on his back in a deep pile of mud and hog shit. the hogs descend.}
