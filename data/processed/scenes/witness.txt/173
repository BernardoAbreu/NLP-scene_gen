<A>__{schaeffer finds another spent shotgun shell, crosses to the ladder, looks down. he sets his shotgun down, takes out his service revolver, starts down.}
<L>__{interior silo day}
<A>__{book has reaches the third kickboard, about thirty feet from the ground. he checks it, turns the thumb screws that hold it in place, places his hand on the handle, moves to one side as best he can... hangs there, listening.}
<B>__{mcelroy}
<A>__{rattling up the other ladder, approaching the third kickboard.}
<B>__{book}
<A>__{listening tensely, hearing mcelroy arrive on the other side of the kickboard. then, deliberately, book makes a fist, raps on the board smartly once.}
<B>__{mcelroy}
<A>__{startled, reacting. he sets his feet, leans back against the back wall of the ladder well, brings the shotgun up, puts the muzzle against the kickboard, clicks off the safety.}
<B>__{book}
<A>__{we hear with him the thump of the muzzle, the click... and, with marvelous speed, book pulls the kickboard and drops it to the floor. mcelroy flash cut s: taring in, stun eyed, already falling forward (having leaned his weight on the shotgun) as book seizes the shotgun by the barrel, pulls inward.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{as mcelroy pitches forward through the opening, screams and grabs as he plunges past book. the shotgun fires as mcelroy manages to hold onto book, and both men plunge thirty feet to the bottom of the silo.}

<A>__{he falls almost straight down, lands on his back, lies stunned.}
<B>__{mcelroy}

<A>__{blinking, groaning, just beginning to stir... and, suddenly, into the frame comes a hand with a pistol in it. the muzzle is placed firmly against book's temple.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{schaeffer holding the pistol. he cocks the pistol, tenses as if to fire (and he is actually about to)... when there is a sound behind him. he snaps around.}

<A>__{he eases the hammer down on this pistol, speaks softly:}
<C>__{schaeffer}
<D>__{okay, johnny. on your feet.}
<B>__{the scene}
<A>__{as book struggles to his feet schaeffer holding the pistol tight to book's head. book turns, sees samuel and stoltzfus, blinks. schaeffer shoves book toward the opening. as book moves toward samuel, he speaks quietly:}
