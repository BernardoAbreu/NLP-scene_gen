<A>__{a trip from queens to new jersey at five o'clock on a friday afternoon is going to look like a dream sequence whatever you do with it, and that's fine. hector's trip to his children has more meaning for us than a simple journey from a to b. we will be aware of our other hectors, and the journeys home that they did or didn't manage to make. this car trip will pull the threads together. and after so many images of the natural world, a world little altered by man, the panoramic shots of new york in all its mad glory will place our hector in a new dimen sion. if there is a breathtaking moment in this film, when everything comes together, when all the pieces fit, then it will be somewhere around here that it happens. six thousand years ago we left hector on a beach, aching for his family. if the traffic allows, tonight in new jersey hector will complete his journey. we will go with hector over the bridge, across the avenues of manhattan and through the tunnel. his phone}

<A>__{on the outskirts of jersey city he finds the suburban street he is looking for. if the last crosslight holds on green then he might even make it on time. hector stops the car outside janet's house and lets out a sigh of relief.}
