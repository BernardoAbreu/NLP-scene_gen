<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior thirteenth floor night}
<A>__{frank emerges on thirteen: walls, the panting police sergeant and team have overturned the furniture in 13m: the absent owners would have trouble recognizing it. the floor is covered with gas powered metal cutters, acetylene torches, ropes, harnesses. a trail of blood leads to where walls stands, tiger's prone body behind him:}
<C>__{walls}
<D>__{get this, frank we got two patients. number one, the scarecrow outside. number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(about coates)}
<D>__{well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.}
<C>__{walls}
<D>__{i don't think the fire people can touch him out there.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{how's he doing?}
<C>__{walls}
<D>__{i haven't had a chance to see him yet. i'm going to take care of sleeping beauty.}
<A>__{frank goes over to coates as two cops strap on harnesses. cy hangs impaled on the railing, a steel spike passing through his hip. glowing in spotlights from thirteen floors below, frank takes coates' vital signs, gently presses his abdomen:}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{does that hurt?}
<C>__{coates}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{frank, iv bag in his teeth, putting an oxygen mask on coates:}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i don't think you've hurt any major organs.}
<P>__{(sets iv line)}
<D>__{we got to get you off this thing without setting off bleeding.}
<A>__{cops behind click on harnesses ("you in?" "yeah" "you in?") attach straps to pitons they've hammered into the brick wall, bring out metal cutters and torches.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{they're gonna torch the fence. you're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.}
<C>__{coates}
<D>__{i can't hold up my head anymore.}
<A>__{frank passes the iv bag to one of the cops, holds coates, head. cy relaxes his neck as sparks splay like fireworks beneath him, fall to the concrete.}
<C>__{coates }
<D>__{so, frank, am i going to live?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you're going to live.}
<C>__{coates}
<D>__{i've been thinking about things. meditating on my financial future. you guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. whatja do, stop for chinese on the way over? there's plenty of food in my place.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i was tired. i needed a coffee.}
<C>__{coates}
<D>__{what about kanita?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{dead.}
<C>__{coates}
<D>__{that's too bad. get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. some kid i wouldn't let wash my mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. damn, i thought i could make it onto the balcony like tiger. he's fat, that's why, falls faster. i'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. am i shot, frank?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{coates}
<D>__{boy can't shoot for shit, either. goddamn that's hot.}
<A>__{frank looks: the spike in coates' hip starting to glow red. cy stretches his hand toward the skyline, his face backlit by raining acetylene sparks:}
<C>__{coates }
<D>__{isn't it beautiful? when the fires start to fall, then the strongest rule it all. i love this city.}
<A>__{the torch breaks the spike free: frank and coates free fall three feet, jerk to a stop. cy yelps. the crowd cheers from below. frank now grabbing, holding coates tightly frank's hands the only thing keeping coates from falling as the cops hoist them up.}
<C>__{cop}
<P>__{(to frank)}
<D>__{good thing we buckled you in, huh?}
<C>__{coates}
<D>__{what about me? who's supposed to buckle me?}
<C>__{cop}
<P>__{(to 2nd cop)}
<D>__{i thought you did. 2nd cop i thought}
<A>__{you did.}
<C>__{cop}
<P>__{(to coates)}
<D>__{i'm so sorry, sir.}
<A>__{the cops lift frank and coates onto the balcony.}
