<A>__{lindsey drops down from the hatch into the small cylindrical pressure chamber. the seals drop down behind her, passing their gear through hand over hand. the chamber is spartan, with steel benches, a folding card table, breathing masks, and medical supplies. catfish greets them through the tiny porthole at one end.}

<D>__{howdy, y'all. hey, lindsey! i will be damned! you shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{couldn't stay away. you running mixture for us? good. couldn't ask for better.}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{okay, here we go. start equalizing, y'all.}
<A>__{hissss of inrushing compressed gas. the pressure in the chamber rises. the breathing mixture is composed of helium, oxygen and nitrogen. catfish monitors it carefully from a station outside the chamber, watching the gauges with a practiced eye. lindsey and the seals all grab their noses and start making funny faces... popping their ears with the familiar diver's 'equalization' technique. they continue as:}

<D>__{get comfortable. the bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down. the worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.}

<D>__{we've been fully briefed, mrs. brigman.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{don't call me that, okay... i hate that. alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of hpns...}

<D>__{high pressure nervous syndrome. muscle tremors, usually in the hands first. nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{very good. about one person in twenty just can't handle it. they go buggo. they're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. we're checked out.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{oh... chamber runs. uh huh, that's good.}
<P>__{(coffey turn away)}
<D>__{well, hey... you guys know any songs?}
<A>__{they ignore her. start going over some diagrams of the montana's interior. it's going to be a long six hours.}
