<L>__{interior apartment night}
<A>__{peter and michael are seated in the living room, which is still an utter wreck. they can't take their eyes off the phone that's between the two of them. they are sitting silently, not moving. mary is playing in her basket. the phone rings. peter and michael both jump three feet in the air. michael picks up the phone.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{hello? who? goddamn it, where are you?...}
<P>__{(to peter)}
<D>__{... it's jack. he just landed in newark. he came back early.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{gimme that.}
<P>__{(he grabs the receiver}
<D>__{out of michael's}
<P>__{hand)}
<D>__{jack? what the hell are you doing?}
<P>__{(listens to a long explanation)}
<D>__{yeah... yeah... oh yeah? well, listen very carefully, jack. that wonderful, fantastic babe you brought back from bolivia? the one you're gonna marry tomorrow? well, you're not going to bring her here!... you are going to say 'goodbye' to her very nicely and put her in a cab back to bolivia... why? because there's another wonderful, fantastic babe waiting for you right here at home ... who is she? oh, that's a surprise! you'll see when you get here. but believe me, she's out of this world. you're going to be up all night with this babe. she's crazy about you.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(in a low tone)}
<D>__{make it quick, the punks may be trying to call...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{so hurry home, jack, this little doll can't wait to see you. 'bye.}
<A>__{he hangs up.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(in a furious temper)}
<D>__{that goddamn mother fuckin' jerk of an asshole! i swear when he comes through the door i will kill him! i will...}
<A>__{the phone interrupts. michael leaps up and answers it.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{hello? listen, tomorrow, central park at the fountain near the merry go round, five o'clock. be there, but...}
<A>__{they've hung up on the other end. michael hangs up and sits down, drained.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{... that was it.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(equally drained)}
<D>__{all we can do now is hope our plan works.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you think the cops have our phone bugged?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i don't think that's legal, is it?}
