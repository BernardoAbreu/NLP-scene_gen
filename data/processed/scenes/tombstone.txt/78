<L>__{ext rustlers park late day}
<A>__{the sun just starts to dip behind the near end of the ridge overlooking the camp where on one side florentino and several cowboys sit in a circle, playing poker while others recline on bedrolls, laughing and drinking. on the other side, at the foot of the ridge, spence, pony deal, and 2 others crouch over a fire, cooking. suddenly the cattle nestled under the far end of the ridge start bleating. spence turns to pony deal who shrugs:}
<C>__{pony deal}
<D>__{maybe they smell a wolf.}
<B>__{spence}
<P>__{(turns to other cowboy)}
<D>__{go up there and take a look.}
<A>__{the cowboy mount a pinto pony and lopes up and over the far side of the ridge. spence and the others continue cooking. moments later a crashing sound comes echoing over the ridge like thunder. the cowboys look up, startled. pony deal points:}
<C>__{pony deal}
<D>__{look!}
<A>__{the pinto gallops riderless back over the ridge. the cowboys exchange confused glances, all attention focused on the far end of the ridge. then the five black horsemen ride out of the sun, gliding like apparitions up and over the near end of the ridge and bearing down on the unsuspecting camp with the speed of a flame. they are within a few yards of the fire when johnny barnes suddenly spots them and:}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{look out!}
<A>__{spence and the others turn and just have time to gasp before wyatt and his horsemen slam into them with terrifying impact, the bodies disappearing under their horses' hooves. the cowboys recoil in total shock, jumping up from bedrolls, stumbling in confusion, scrambling to get out of the way as the possemen plow through the fire and roar into camp, pistols blazing in air, horses rearing and snorting.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{united states marshals! reach!}
<A>__{everyone freezes. a worried looking florentino shrinks back behind the others, trying not to be spotted. meanwhile doc leans down and pokes his pistol into a nearby cowboy's forehead.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{say something witty.}
<A>__{they herd the cowboys over to one side of camp, shouting, "get over there!", "move it!", etc. but barnes brazens up to wyatt:}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{hey, you can't come }
<A>__{a loud crack as wyatt's quirt lays his face open to the bone.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{one more word and i will blind you. get over there!}
<C>__{pony deal}
<P>__{(to mcmasters)}
<D>__{hey brother, what're you doin' }
<C>__{mcmasters}
<D>__{i ain't your brother, i ain't none of your damn brothers. move!}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{all right, run 'em off.}
<A>__{doc and wyatt cover the cowboys while the others scatter their herd with pistol shots. indignant, swilling sneers at wyatt:}
<C>__{swilling}
<D>__{bastard! stinkin' bastard! like to eat you blood raw!}
<A>__{a queer look in his eye, wyatt dismounts and faces swilling.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{all right, breed. dig in.}
<A>__{and then wyatt drills him in the jaw with a straight right hand. swilling drops like a stone. wyatt hauls him up by the hair and hammers him left right left, steps around, digs down, and pile drives a left hook to his gut. swilling topples back into a seated position then rolls over with a moan and passes out. meanwhile, seeing his chance, florentino ducks down and makes for the remuda as doc looks down at swilling.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{it appears he missed an excellent chance to keep his mouth shut.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<P>__{(faces cowboys)}
<D>__{felt his liver go on that last one. get him to a doctor or he'll be dead in a couple hours.}
<A>__{at the remuda florentino leaps on a horse and gallops off bareback. mcmasters point, pulling his rifle from its scabbard:}
<C>__{mcmasters}
<D>__{florentino! he's getting away!}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{drop his horse.}
<A>__{mcmasters draws a bead on the retreating form with his '76 winchester and fires. 100 yards away, the bullet hits florentino's horse in the shoulder with a "thunk". it drops, tumbling end over end and plunging florentino face first into the ground. he jumps up, spitting out a mouthful, and starts running. wyatt leaps on this black and it streaks forward, closing the distance in seconds. florentino gasps and runs faster, pulling a bellygun from his sash, wyatt almost on top of him. he turns and fires on the run. a branch next to wyatt's head explodes. wyatt keeps coming, drawing his buntline, impervious, unstoppable. florentino turns for another shot just as the black piles into him, sending him flying and tumbling him down an embankment. he scrambles to his feet as wyatt dismounts, starting toward him with deliberate step, eyes blazing, long barreled pistol held in front of him. florentino backs up in terror, gun at his side, shaking his head:}
<C>__{florentino}
<D>__{i don't kill your brother! i don't even know him. i was only lookout. it was money, they give me twelve dollars! it was money!}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{a human life. twelve dollars.}
<A>__{wyatt nods, still coming, cold blooded murder in his eye. florentino screams, raising his gun:}
<C>__{florentino}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{wyatt fires, blasting florentino to the ground. he advances, firing over and over, emptying his gun into him....}
