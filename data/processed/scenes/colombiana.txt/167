<C>__{danny}
<D>__{ok. ok. i get it. you want to protect yourself. i understand. but i'm...i don't just want to be here for the sex. i know a lot of guys would think this is perfect. she comes over, we fuck like mad. she leaves. but i need a little more.}

<C>__{danny }
<D>__{if you can't talk about? that's ok. but, you know, if someone hurt you before...like a broken heart or something. i'm not responsible for that. i just want want to be here for you. to know a little about what's inside. what you feel. just a little.}
<A>__{cat hesitates, standing there half dressed, feelings that she never wants to deal with coming to the surface.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i'm lonely sometimes.}
<A>__{she stops.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{...and?}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{isn't that enough?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{it's a good start.}
<A>__{he smiles, puts the stuffed animal aside.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{now we can have sex.}
<A>__{cat smiles, caught a bit off guard by his sweetness. he approaches her, she goes to touch him. he puts her hands down, gently.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{let me this time.}
<A>__{and for the first time, she lets him touch her first. let's him kiss her lips, her neck, and as he goes south, kissing as he goes, the camera holds on her face, and for the first time she allows herself to receive, to give herself over to being the seduced rather than the seducer. and she likes it.}
