<A>__{ramon's father carefully reads the violin contract while ramon and concepcion anxiously watch. he stops to look up a word in the english spanish dictionary beside him. ramon and his mom are squirming. manuelo nods as he finishes reading, then signs the contract. ramon breaks into a smile, throws his little arms around his papa and kisses him.}
