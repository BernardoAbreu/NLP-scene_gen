<L>__{exterior the old hackett place day}
<A>__{near the front entrance. after a moment, the door opens, and the blandings and mr. apollonio emerge. jim, limping, is aided and abetted by a cane. apollonio is a stolid, new york construction man, replete with derby, blue serge suit, and cigar. a short rule sticks out of a back pocket. as they emerge, the blandings are hopefully enthusiastic; apollonio is thoughtfully noncommittal.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{it has charm, hasn't it, mr. apollonio?}
<C>__{apollonio}
<P>__{(through his cigar)}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{of course, any small changes would have to conform with the character of the countryside.}
<C>__{apollonio}
<P>__{(through his cigar)}
<D>__{mm hmm.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{and yet still be functional.}
<A>__{apollonio casually walks over to the corner of the house, kicks an exposed beam. it crumbles, apparently rotted by termites. two shingles fall off. the blandings watch him anxiously.}
<C>__{apollonio}
<P>__{(gazing upward; oblivious)}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<A>__{as he thoughtfully rubs his chin, jim, followed by muriel, limps his way over to him.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{well, uh, what's your professional opinion?}
<A>__{apollonio looks at the blandings, at the house, then back at the blandings. he takes the cigar from his mouth.}
<C>__{apollonio}
<D>__{tear it down.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(appalled)}
<D>__{tear it down??!}
<C>__{apollonio}
<D>__{if your chimney was shot and your sills was okay, i'd say go ahead, fix her up. if your sills was shot and your chimney was okay, again i'd say go ahead, fix her up. but your sills are shot and your chimney is shot.}
<A>__{during this speech apollonio picks up a wooden frame, squares it with a pocket square, levels it on a fence, and looks through it at the house.}
<C>__{apollonio}
<P>__{(beckoning)}
<D>__{take a look at the way she sags.}
<A>__{the blandings step over, look through the frame.}
<B>__{what they see.}
<A>__{what they see. outlined against the frame, the house slants, sagging perceptibly.}
<B>__{three shot as the blandings react with some dismay}
<A>__{three shot as the blandings react with some dismay.}
<C>__{apollonio}
<D>__{so i say don't throw good money after bad tear it down.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(coolly)}
<D>__{thanks a lot.}
<C>__{apollonio}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<A>__{he tips his hat, walks out of scene.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{bill cole and his experts!}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{darling, we'll get our own experts.}
