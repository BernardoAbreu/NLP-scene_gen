<A>__{establishing shot of this lovely park. zt looks like a sweet, summer home compared to the looming expansiveness of the potala. it is filled with deer and antelope, peacocks and nesting birds. an eccentric collection of trees grow here some indigenous, some gifts bearing flowers and fruit. there are fish ponds and even a kyichu river tributary nearby. we find the young dalai lama standing by this tributary daring to put one foot on a slippery, stepping stone. an attendant gently pulls him back. beyond the river, a herder leads a small group of braying sheep towards town. the boy watches. he listens to the herder's song.}
