<L>__{interior crime lab. day.}
<A>__{the investigator lifts his head from the eyepiece of an electron microscope through which he has been examining a tiny fragment of skin the skin is identified as belonging to 20 year old vincent. detective hugo stands at the investigator's side his attitude more respectful in light of the discovery. detective hugo points out a location on a computer generated map.}
<C>__{detective hugo}
<P>__{(chagrined)}
<D>__{the skin flake was found in michael's restaurant. the employees are all accounted for.}
<C>__{investigator}
<D>__{a customer? does this michael's cater to misfits?}
<C>__{detective hugo}
<P>__{(shifting the view of the map to include the gattaca complex)}
<D>__{no. but one or two "borrowed ladders" have shown up there in the past.}
<A>__{the investigator understands the significance. they wander over to a blow up photograph of the 20 year old vincent.}
<C>__{detective hugo}
<D>__{we have to consider the possibility that he's playing somebody else's hand.}
<A>__{a smile gradually broadens across the investigator's face.}
<C>__{investigator}
<P>__{(taking a perverse pleasure in the slowly dawning revelation)}
<D>__{of course. he's a "de gene erate".}
<P>__{(glancing to a photo of the gattaca crime scene)}
<D>__{he works at gattaca. why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom? nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.}
<C>__{detective hugo}
<P>__{(quickly covering himself)}
<D>__{it's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man it could have blown in through an open window.}
<A>__{the investigator appears not to be listening, his mind made up.}
<C>__{investigator}
<P>__{(mind racing)}
<D>__{he was afraid of being exposed. that's why he did it.}
<C>__{detective hugo}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{it is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers. you've seen their security system. they know who works there.}
<P>__{(referring to 20 year old vincent's profile)}
<D>__{even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.}
<C>__{investigator}
<D>__{don't underestimate these imposters.}
<C>__{detective hugo}
<P>__{(skeptical, referring to a file of gattaca employee id photos)}
<D>__{none of the id photos match the enhancement.}
<C>__{investigator}
<P>__{(smiling to himself)}
<D>__{a man can change his face but blood is forever. sample every employee within the parameters i gave you.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{intravenous.}
<A>__{hugo's mouth drops open at the mention of "intravenous".}
<C>__{detective hugo}
<P>__{(immediately protesting)}
<D>__{you know their workforce. two thirds at least fall into the category. we'll be closing down their operation for days.}
<P>__{(seeking a compromise)}
<D>__{at least go with a fingertip sample or urine.}
<C>__{investigator}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{blood. from the vein.}
<A>__{the investigator turns on his heel to prevent further protest. the detective and his assistants exchange looks of exasperation behind the investigator's back.}
