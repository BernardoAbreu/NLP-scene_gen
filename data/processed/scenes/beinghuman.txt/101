<A>__{a solitary slave makes his way up from the camp to the natives on the dunes. everyone in the camp watches as he approaches them. there is tension. will the natives run or fight or talk. they begin to talk. the natives seem most interested in the hangings, and point in that direction, asking questions. the slave makes an attempt at explaining what is happening, but the natives seem baffled. they start laughing and shaking their heads. by now the second figure is dangling on the rope, the cross making an efficient double gallows.}
