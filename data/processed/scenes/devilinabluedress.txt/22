<C>__{coretta}
<D>__{why you keep askin' 'bout her? colored women ain't good enough for you no more?}
<A>__{she undoes a button on his shirt and kisses his chest, and unbuttons another working her way down. easy sweats harder than when he was lifting dupree.}

<D>__{way he snorin'?}
<A>__{on the sofa minutes later}
<C>__{coretta}
<D>__{oh yeah, daddy. you hittin' my spot! oh yeah... yeah!}
<A>__{the top of her dress undone, coretta is straddling easy who is hitting her spot and his too, in a rhythm. eyes closed, he bites his lip to hold in the ecstasy so as not to awaken dupree, who is sawing logs shredding 'em in the bedroom. suddenly coretta tears herself off of him and sits back on his knees. easy writhes and shakes like a power line shorting out.}
<C>__{coretta}
<P>__{(coy, shy)}
<D>__{oooh, that's just too good, easy.}
<A>__{easy tries to pull her back but she twists down to the floor.}
<C>__{coretta}
<D>__{i can't give up that much love, daddy, not the way things is.}
<C>__{easy}
<P>__{(out loud)}
<D>__{what things?}
<A>__{she shushes him with a finger and twists her head toward the bedroom.}

<C>__{easy}
<P>__{(full voice)}
<D>__{forget about him! you got me goin', coretta!}

<C>__{easy}
<D>__{who cares, what man? i don't want nobody but you...}
<A>__{he pulls her toward him but she pushes him away.}
<C>__{coretta}
<D>__{but daphne's my friend }
<A>__{frustrated, he sits back against the sofa and coretta, sensing that he is snapping out of her spell, slides forward onto him giving him her spot again. and within moments they are back at it.}
<C>__{coretta}
<D>__{oh, baby. oh, daddy, you hittin' my spot! oh, yeah...}
<C>__{easy }
