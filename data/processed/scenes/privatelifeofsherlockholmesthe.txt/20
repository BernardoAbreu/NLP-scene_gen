<L>__{interior dressing room night}
<A>__{it is small, elegant and sensuous. there is vodka in an ice bucket, next to a recamier chaise, a paravent, masses of flowers, and finally madame petrova, still in costume, sitting at a dressing table with multiple mirrors, undoing her hair. candles, in two elaborate candleabra, give madame's face a special glow.}

<C>__{petrova}
<P>__{(to holmes)}
<D>__{otchen rada.}
<A>__{she extends her hand, and holmes takes it.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{madame.}
<A>__{he kisses her hand. petrova appraises him from head to toe, and back again.}
<C>__{petrova}
<P>__{(to holmes)}
<D>__{vi menshe rostom chem ja ozhidala.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{madame says you are shorter than she thought.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i didn't mean to be.}
<C>__{petrova}
<D>__{no eto nie vazhno. menia interessujut glavnim obra som vashi mosghi.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{short, tall, who cares? it is the brains that count.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(to rogozhin)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(catching himself, to petrova)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{petrova rises, crosses to the paravent.}
<C>__{petrova}
<D>__{ja prochia vsie vashi prikliuchenia. zamiechatelno! os sobenno sobaka baskervillei.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{madame is great admirer of yours. she has read every story her favorite is big dog from baskerville.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i'm afraid it loses something in translation.}
<A>__{petrova is now behind the paravent, undressing, only her head visible.}
<C>__{petrova}
<D>__{nikolai, pokazhite iemu skripku.}
<A>__{rogozhin picks up a violin case, opens it.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{mr. holmes, you know about fiddles.}
<P>__{(takes violin out, hands it to him)}
<D>__{what is your opinion of this?}
<A>__{holmes holds the violin up, peers through one of the sound holes.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{'antonius stradivarius cremonesis, anno 1709.' well, the label is authentic.}
<P>__{(examines violin, plucks strings)}
<D>__{judging from the shape, the color of the varnish, and the tone, i would say it is a genuine stradivarius of the best period.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{you like?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it's magnificent.}
<C>__{petrova}
<P>__{(from behind paravent)}
<D>__{skazhite jemu chto eto podarok ot menia.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{here take it. madame says it is yours.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{mine?}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{for services you will render.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{my fees as a detective are not exactly trifling but a stradivarius you're not serious.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{i am not. but madame is.}
<A>__{petrova emerges from behind the paravent, in a brocade dressing gown.}
<C>__{petrova}
<D>__{nalejte vodki i obiasnite jemu v chom dielo.}
<A>__{she drapes herself on the chaise.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{all right. i will pour vodka and explain.}
<P>__{(starts pouring vodka; it is pink)}
<D>__{mr. holmes, what you have seen tonight is last and positively final performance of madame petrova. she is retiring.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{what a shame.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{she has been dancing since she was three years old. and after all, she is now thirty eight.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(gallantly)}
<D>__{i must say she doesn't look thirty eight.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{that is because she is forty nine.}
<P>__{(he hands her a glass of}
<D>__{vodka, with an exaggerated}
<P>__{smile)}
<D>__{so madame has decided to leave ballet and spend life bringing up her child.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{how admirable.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<P>__{(hands him vodka)}
<D>__{problem now is to find father.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{oh? is he missing?}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{correct.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{and that's why you called me in?}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{also correct. we must have father, because without father, how can there be child?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i see. the whole thing is still in the planning stage }
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{correct again. madame would like child to be brilliant and beautiful. since she is beautiful she now needs man who is brilliant.}
<A>__{holmes' eyes wander slowly toward petrova. she raises her glass.}
<C>__{petrova}
<D>__{za zdorovie.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<P>__{(raising his glass)}
<D>__{za zdorovie.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{za zdrovie.}
<A>__{petrova and rogozhin down their vodka bottoms up. holmes takes one swallow, then stops.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{what's in it?}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{what does it taste like?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{red pepper.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{that's what's in it.}
<A>__{while rogozhin refills petrova's glass and his own, holmes takes another tentative sip.}
<C>__{petrova}
<P>__{(to holmes)}
<D>__{kogda mi smozhem dvinutsa v putj?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{madame wants to know how soon you can be ready.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{ready?}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{to leave for venice. all arrangements have been made. you will spend one week there with madame...}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{well, this is all very flattering. but surely there are other me better men }
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{to tell you truth, you were not first choice. we considered russian writer, tolstoi }
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{that's more like it. the man's a genius.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{too old... then we considered the philosopher, nietzsche }
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{absolutely first rate mind...}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{too german... and we considered tschaikowski }
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{oh, you couldn't go wrong with tschaikowski }
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{we could and we did. it was catastrophe.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{you don't know? because tschaikowski how shall put it? women not his glass of tea.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{pity, that.}
<C>__{petrova}
<P>__{(to rogozhin)}
<D>__{skazhite jemu chto je otchen dovolna etim resheniem.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{madame is very happy with final choice.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{madame mustn't be too hasty. she must remember i'm an englishman.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you know what they say about us. if there's one thing more deplorable than our cooking, it's our love making. we are not exactly the most romantic of people }
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{perfect. we don't want sentimental idiots falling in love, committing suicide. one week in venice she goes back to st. petersburg with baby you go back to london with fiddle.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{an equitable arrangement.}
<P>__{(puts down violin)}
<D>__{about my medical history when you asked me i neglected to mention a small detail. there is hemophilia in my family. we're all bleeders.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<P>__{(to petrova)}
<D>__{on govorit, chto v jevo semie stradajut ghemofilijei.}
<C>__{petrova}
<D>__{pust nie bezpokoitsa. ja ostrighu sebe noghti.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{madame says not to worry. she will not scratch you.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{that's reassuring to know. but }
<C>__{petrova}
<P>__{(to rogozhin)}
<D>__{pochemu on kolebletsa? on nie nahodit menia dostatochno privlekatelnoi?}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{madame says you talk too much. you find her attractive or no?}
<A>__{before holmes can answer, the door opens and watson sticks his head in. he is flushed and slightly inebriated, and there is a flower tucked behind his ear. from off comes the sound of wild balalaika music.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<P>__{(to rogozhin)}
<D>__{what does prokanzik mean?}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{it means 'you little devil.'}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{it does? i am? thank you.}
<A>__{he hurries off, shutting the door.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<P>__{(to holmes)}
<D>__{i repeat question. you find madame attractive or no?}
<A>__{holmes is still looking at the door where watson exited, an idea forming in his mind.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(turning to rogozhin)}
<D>__{oh, i find her most attractive for a woman, that is.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{then no problem.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{maybe a slight one. you see, i am not a free man.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{not free? you are a bachelor.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{a bachelor living with another bachelor for the last five years. five very happy years.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{what is it you are trying to tell me?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i hoped i could avoid the subject. but some of us through a cruel caprice of mother nature }
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{get to pointerior}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{the point is that tschaikowski is not an isolated case.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{you mean, you and dr. watson ?}
<P>__{(holmes nods)}
<D>__{he is your glass of tea?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{if you want to be picturesque about it.}
<C>__{petrova}
<P>__{(slightly agitated)}
<D>__{chto on govorit? pri chom tut chaikovsky?}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{on pederast.}
<C>__{petrova}
<P>__{(on her feet now; flaring)}
<D>__{jescho odin? eto stanovitsa odnoobrasno! kakoi vi idiot!}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(picking up his silk hat and cane)}
<D>__{believe me, madame, the loss is all mine. but i would prefer to disappoint you know than disappoint you in a gondola in venice.}
<A>__{he takes her limp hand, kisses it. then he crosses to the door.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(imitating rogozhin's accent)}
<D>__{it would have been catastrophe.}
<A>__{he exits. rogozhin starts to pour himself another glass of vodka. petrova slaps the glass out of his hand.}
<C>__{petrova}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{potchemu vi nie vijasnili eto eto ranshe, prezhde chem posoritj menia!}
<B>__{stage}
<A>__{the party has built into a real wingding by now. it's wild drinking, laughing, singing. everybody is turned on especially watson. he is dancing with a dozen of the ballerinas to madly accelerating balalaika music. flower behind ear, hair mussed, tie undone, short of breath he is in paradise. holmes makes his way through the revelers, approaches watson.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{watson!}
<P>__{(watson pays no attention)}
<D>__{watson, are you coming?}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(without missing a step)}
<D>__{what is it, old boy?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{we're going home.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{home? not a chance. not the slightest not the remotest chance. toodle ooo.}
<A>__{he waves goodbye, and goes on swirling dizzily with the girls. holmes puts on his silk hat and leaves. a shaken rogozhin comes up to the buffet, pours himself a stiff drink of vodka. as he drinks his eyes follow the dancing watson balefully. watson spins off several of the girls, grabs another group. his ex partners wind up close to rogozhin. he whispers something to them. their eyes widen, and they stare at watson with disbelief. watson again switches partners, and the first girls now whisper intensely to those who just left the floor. the same reaction. watson, oblivious to all this, is whirling around with another set of girls. by now some of the girls who are in on the secret are whispering to the male dancers in tights. their reaction is slightly different. they are seeing watson in a new light. and before watson knows what's happening, he has been abandoned by all the girls, and is joined first by one pair then another pair of male dancers, till he is dancing only with gay guys in tights. it gradually dawns on watson that there is something wrong with this state of affairs. after some difficulty, he breaks away from them.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{hold on! just a moment!}
<A>__{spotting rogozhin, he crosses to him. the girls shrink away at his approach.}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(bewildered)}
<D>__{what's going on? what happened to the girls?}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{why? do you not prefer it this way?}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{what way?}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{you don't have to pretend. mr. holmes told us everything about you and him }
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{about me and him?}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{come now, no need to be bashful. we are not bourgeois. maybe with doctors and detectives is unusual but in ballet, is very usual.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{what is?}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{caprice of mother nature. look at pavel and mischa and boris and dmitri }
<A>__{watson looks around at the boys in tights, who are standing in a half circle, grinning at him insolently. it is beginning to dawn on him. he pales.}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{ and ilya and sergei }
<P>__{(breaks off, rocks his hand back and forth)}
<D>__{sergei half and half.}
<A>__{he pours himself another vodka. watson grabs the glass away from him, downs it with a gulp.}
