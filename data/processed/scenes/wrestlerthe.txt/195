<L>__{interior auditorium continuous}
<A>__{randy bursts through the curtain to huge cheers. there's probably 700 people there in the 2,200 seat facility.}
<L>__{interior commentators' table continuous}
<A>__{seated at a ringside table are the match's commentators, a pair of wannabe marv alberts in their 20s. a sign taped to the table reads carolina wrestling network. next to the table is a videocamera on a tripod.}
<D>__{commentator #1 there he is, folks! randy the ram!}
<A>__{randy raises a set of ram's horns high in the air. fans do the same in tribute.}
<D>__{commentator #2 history about to be made here at the greenville civic auditorium.}
<A>__{randy takes a long lap around the ring, ramming chair after chair. his head gets a little bloody. the fans eat it up. randy climbs into the ring, where the ayatollah awaits. the cheers continue. loving, appreciative, sustained cheers. randy stands there soaking it in, basking in their love. he grabs the microphone from the ring announcer. he looks around. a hush comes over the crowd.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{i just got one thing to say to you people...}
<A>__{randy looks toward cassidy, standing over by the entrance curtain. he looks out at the larger crowd.}
<C>__{randy }
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{loud cheers. randy takes a contemplative pause.}
<C>__{randy }
<D>__{you take your lumps and bruises in this game. but you know what? it's all worth it. because of you guys. your cheers keep me young. they make me feel alive.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{in 1982, the year i wrestled my first professional match, i was six foot one. by 1993, i was five foot eleven. three back surgeries in 11 years knocked two full inches off my height. i may be down to five eleven, but performing in front of you people has always made me feel 10 feet tall. and that's the way it's always gonna be.}
<A>__{randy looks toward cassidy, who's standing over by the entrance curtain. their eyes meet.}
<C>__{randy }
<D>__{forever.}
<A>__{randy lowers the mike, finished. the fans cheer wildly, the loudest cheers yet. as randy nods appreciatively at the crowd, the ayatollah sneaks up behind him with a folding chair. fans shout, trying to warn randy about the sneak attack, but he doesn't hear them. the ayatollah smashes him over the head. randy goes down. the match is on. the ayatollah picks up randy and throws him into the ropes. randy bounces back toward the ayatollah, who lazily puts up an elbow for randy to run into. randy practically has to lead his face to the elbow. hitting the mat, randy pops back up and grabs the ayatollah. the ayatollah, phoning it in, throws randy into the ropes again. this time, the ayatollah has a raised knee waiting for randy. randy runs into it, doing his best to sell the shot.}
<C>__{randy }
<P>__{(under breath)}
<D>__{you're workin' pretty light here.}
<A>__{randy gets up and grabs the ayatollah's arms. with a nifty move, he flips the ayatollah over his shoulder, slamming him hard into the mat. randy falls on top of him, pressing the ayatollah's face into the canvas.}
<C>__{the ayatollah}
<D>__{jesus. relax.}
<A>__{randy flips the ayatollah over onto his back, pinning his shoulder blades. the ref swoops in.}
<C>__{referee}
<D>__{one!... two!...}
<A>__{the ayatollah kicks out. they both get up. the ayatollah jogs toward the ropes. he bounces off. randy braces for something good, but all he gets is a feeble chest slap. randy grabs the ayatollah and puts him in a headlock.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{anytime you wanna join in.}
<A>__{randy scoops up the ayatollah and drops him over his knee with a backbreaker. the ayatollah grimaces in pain as he hits the mat. before he has a chance to get up, randy hits him with a flying elbow drop. the ayatollah gets up, pissed at the rough treatment. randy goes for a dropkick, but the ayatollah catches his ankles in midair. he jerks upward on randy's legs, sending randy crashing to the mat on the back of his head. the ayatollah falls on randy's throat with his knee. he grinds randy's face into the canvas as randy did to him.}
