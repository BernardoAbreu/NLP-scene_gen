<L>__{interior bar day}
<A>__{jacob and paul are sitting in a dark booth in an obscure williamsburg bar. it is nearly empty. paul is leaning across the table in a very intimate fashion.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{somethin's wrong, jake. i don't know what it is but i can't talk to anybody about it. i figured i could with you. you always used to listen, you know?}
<A>__{jacob nods. paul takes a sip of his drink and stares deliberately into jacob's eyes.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i'm going to hell!}
<A>__{jacob's face grows suddenly tense.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{that's as straight as i can put it. and don't tell me that i'm crazy 'cause i know i'm not. i'm goin' to hell. they're comin' after me.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(frightened, but holding back)}
<D>__{who is?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{they've been followin' me. they're comin' outta the walls. i don't trust anyone. i'm not even sure i trust you. but i gotta talk to someone. i'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.}
<A>__{paul cannot contain his fear. he jumps up suddenly and walks away from the booth. jacob follows him with his eyes but does not go after him. a young man in the next booth observes the scene with interest. he looks vaguely familiar, like we have seen him before. paul stares out the window for a moment and then walks over to the juke box. he pulls a quarter out of his pocket and drops it in the slot. his finger pushes a selection at random. some '60's rock hit blares out. jacob's mind is reeling by the time paul sits back down.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{sorry. sometimes i think i'm just gonna jump outta my skin. they're just drivin' me wild.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{who, paul? what exactly ... ?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i don't know who they are, or what they are. but they're gonna get me and i'm scared, jake. i'm so scared i can't do anything. i can't go to my sisters. i can't even go home.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{they're waitin' for me, that's why.}
<A>__{paul's hand starts to shake. the tremor spreads rapidly to his whole body. the booth begins to rattle.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i can't stop it. i try. oh god! help me jake.}
<A>__{jacob slides quickly out of his side of the booth and moves in toward paul. he puts his arm around him and holds him tightly, offering comfort as best he can. paul is obviously terrified and grateful for jacob's gesture. a few people at the bar look over in their direction.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{it's okay, paul. it's okay.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{i don't know what to do.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{don't do anything.}
<P>__{(paul begins to relax a}
<D>__{bit and the shaking}
<P>__{subsides)}
<D>__{paul, i know what you're talking about.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i've seen them too ... the demons!}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(staring at jacob)}
<D>__{you've seen them?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{everywhere, like a plague.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{god almighty. i thought i was the only one.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{me, too. i had no idea. it's like i was coming apart at the seams.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{oh god. i know. i know.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what is it paul? what's happening to me?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{they keep telling me i'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.}
<P>__{(he fumbles in his coat}
<D>__{pocket and pulls out a small bible and silver}
<P>__{cross)}
<D>__{i carry these everywhere but they don't help. nothing helps. everyone thinks i'm crazy. my mother filed a report with the army.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{the army?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{she said i haven't been the same since then. since that night. there's still this big hole in my brain. it's so dark in there, jake. and these creatures. it's like they're crawling out of my brain. what happened that night? why won't they tell us?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i don't know. i don't know.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{they're monsters, jake. we're both seein' 'em. there's gotta be a connection. something.}
<A>__{jacob leans back in the booth, his mind racing. the young man in the next booth is watching them with rapt attention.}
