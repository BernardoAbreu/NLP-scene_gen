<L>__{interior small office day}
<A>__{precious and ms. rain sit close together over a small table looking down at a large colorful children's book.}
<C>__{ms. rain}
<D>__{...i just want you to read a page from this book.}
<A>__{precious looks up at her blankly and then back down at the book with trepidation.}
<C>__{precious }
<D>__{sure lady, right after i get voted president.}
<C>__{ms. rain}
<D>__{precious?}
<C>__{precious}
<D>__{i can't do that miz rain.}
<C>__{ms. rain}
<D>__{c'mon precious. give it a try.}
<A>__{precious looks mortified and starts breathing heavily. rapid montage door slams, moans, panting, plates breaking, meat sizzling, zippers, grunts, squeaking bed springs, laughter, screams, a razor slicing young flesh, sweat and daytime television all assault her mind's senses. ms. rain speaks with a dire look of concern on her face but no words come out. she places a hand on precious' shoulder and the kaleidoscope of sounds sucks away into the air. the words from ms. rain's mouth finally register.}
<C>__{ms. rain}
<D>__{precious. honey are you okay? try to relax. should i call an ambulance? 911? your moth ...}
<C>__{precious}
<D>__{no! !!}
<A>__{ms. rain jumps.}
<C>__{ms. rain}

<C>__{precious}
<D>__{the pages ...}
<A>__{ms. rain looks down perplexed.}
<C>__{precious}
<P>__{(defeated)}
<D>__{they all look alike to me. always did.}
<C>__{ms. rain}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the words or the pictures?}
<C>__{precious}
<D>__{the words.}
<A>__{ms. rain sighs. she sits back for a moment and looks as if she's processing more than just the tragedy of this particular situation but what is that of countless others. in a decisive, almost militaristic movement, ms. rain sits up again.}
<C>__{ms. rain}
<D>__{i think i understand you precious but i still want you to try. you're going to have to push yourself.}
<A>__{precious looks back down at the page. there are people of various colors on a beach.}
<C>__{ms. rain}
<D>__{what do you think the story is about?}
<C>__{precious}
<D>__{peoples at the beach?}
<C>__{ms. rain}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{ms. rain points to the letter a. it is the first word on the page.}
<C>__{ms. rain}
<D>__{do you know what that is?}
<C>__{precious}
<D>__{yes. a.}
<A>__{ms. rain points to the next word.}
<C>__{ms. rain}
<D>__{do you know that word?}
<C>__{precious}
<D>__{no. i don't.}
<C>__{ms. rain}
<D>__{do you know the letters.}
<A>__{precious nods. ms. rain points to the letters ...}
<C>__{precious}
<D>__{d, a, y.}
<C>__{ms. rain}
<D>__{do you know that word?}
<A>__{precious shakes her head.}
<C>__{ms. rain}
<D>__{day. that word is day.}
<A>__{ms. rain points to the next word.}
<C>__{ms. rain}
<D>__{what's that word?}
<C>__{precious}
<D>__{ate.}
<C>__{ms. rain}
<D>__{good! almost! the word is 'at'.}
<A>__{ms. rain points at the next word.}
<C>__{precious}
<D>__{the!}
<A>__{ms. rain points to the next word.}
<C>__{precious}
<D>__{...beach?}
<C>__{ms. rain}
<D>__{'shore'. that word is 'shore'. that's almost like 'beach'. very good. can you read the whole thing?}
<A>__{precious nods.}
<C>__{precious}
<D>__{a day at the shore.}
<A>__{amazed the words that escaped were from her very own mouth, precious' jaw drops. she whirls to ms. rain. ms. rain smiles. we ease away from the office as the two of them continue working down the page.}
