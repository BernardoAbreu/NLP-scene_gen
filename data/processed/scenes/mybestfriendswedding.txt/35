<L>__{interior walter's office day}
<A>__{julianne enters the spacious corner office, high above the city. closes the door, quietly, behind her. so anxious, she is practically hyperventilating. she goes, slowly to the vacant cherrywood desk. its computer and monitor standing silent. she is stalking it, like a deadly animal. and then. she is there. talking to herself, her own desperate support network...}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{you can do this.}
<A>__{sacred, filled with doubt and conflict. her hands clutch at each other. then, one flicks out. and the computer goes on. the screen glows. waits for her. her mouth is sand, her stomach water. she pulls the paper from her pocket... ... looks at it. looks to the monitor. and begins. to type...}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(mumbling to herself)}
<D>__{e mail address. to ben isaacson, senior editor, sports illustrated, from... walter wallace.}
<A>__{and stops. her heart is thumping.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{see, you can do it. it's easy.}
<A>__{doesn't look easy. licks her lips.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{you do it fast, it's over. like it never happened.}
<A>__{she sits. and recites as she types...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{ben. i need a favor.}
<A>__{here we go. this is it. types...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{my daughter's every happiness. and my wife's. and, least of all, my own, are in your hands.}
<A>__{nods, okay. breathing hard. types...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{knowing you value our friendship, and the... cooperative relationship between our companies... i am hopeful of your help.}
<A>__{touch, that. thinks. it has to be. types...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i have offered mike o'neal, my new son in law, a great opportunity in my company. this would also enable my daughter to settle in chicago, near us, and pursue her dreams and plans.}
<A>__{almost there. almost. types...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{to his own detriment, as well as ours, michael will not accept our offer. while he works for you.}
<A>__{she stands up. stares at the screen. walks away. walks back. still standing, types...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{my daughter joins me in this plea for your cooperation and discretion.}
<A>__{is there a sound? outside the door. she hovers over the escape key. waits. waits. silence. types...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{with gratitude. for your understanding. walter.}
<A>__{she hits a key. the screen goes blank. the computer asks... do you wish to send? she tells the computer...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{are you crazy? get him fired?}
<A>__{types no. the computer asks hold for later? and she types yes.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{just till tonight when i bring him back. to look for...}
<A>__{she glances to her huge bag. rummages through, pulling out a manila folder. lays it by the blank computer. fans out a few pages in a natural, disorderly way. takes a step back... and stares. struck to her gut. but when she has done.}
