<A>__{starla moves slowly in toward grant, as if to kiss him. grant looks, well, joyful. and then she yanks the metal spike from her skirt and jabs it into grant's eye. grant screeches, blind and bucking. starla slams the spike into his other eye. and she stabs him again, shoving the spike into his forehead, where it stays. starla leaps to the window. she throws open the drapes.}
