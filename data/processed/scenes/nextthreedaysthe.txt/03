<L>__{interior steak house night}
<A>__{two couples sit at a table, picking at dessert, john and lara brennan on one side, mick and erit on the other. john is attractive in a worn kind of way, but has the eyes of a kid with a discipline problem. you have to really know him to understand if he is mocking you or agreeing with you. he is a master of irony and has a true enjoyment of the absurd. lara looks beautiful even in her wrinkled suit. she appears to have had a hard day at the office. she's been drinking at dinner; it hasn't eased her nerves. john's good looking brother, mick, boasts his blue collar roots and a gorgeous, if slightly trashy, girlfriend, erit, who isn't ashamed of her body or sharing her opinions. john and mick are laughing. lara puts cash on the tray beside mick's credit card.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{you know what? if you were smart you would stop talking right now.}
<C>__{erit}
<D>__{sue me. i just know that women should never work for women.}
<A>__{john laughs and applauds. mick buries his head.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{how can you say that??}
<C>__{erit}
<D>__{they're always threatened. especially if you're beautiful and they're not.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{erit, you are so full of shit.}
<C>__{erit}
<D>__{so, your boss isn't threatened by you?}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{because she's a bitch! }
<P>__{(as john and mick laugh)}
<D>__{ not because she's a woman.}
<C>__{erit}
<D>__{and you would describe her as "attractive"?}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{that has nothing to do with it!}
<C>__{erit}
<D>__{and there is my answer.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{either of you like another drink?}
<A>__{lara shoots john a burning look as erit builds on her victory.}
<C>__{erit}
<D>__{women should work under men, men under women. that's it.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(egging her on)}
<D>__{but men under men?}
<C>__{erit}
<D>__{that's fine, too.}
<P>__{(the men burst into laughter)}
<D>__{they're used to it! why are you laughing?}
<C>__{mick}
<P>__{(re: erit)}
<D>__{i don't know, bro, but i think i'd rather work under you than her.}
<C>__{erit}
<P>__{(insulted, shoots back)}
<D>__{oh please, i'd rather work under him, too.}
<A>__{that was a dig at mick but lara is primed for a fight.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{you'd rather "work under" john?}
<C>__{erit}
<D>__{you have a problem with that, too?}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{no, why would i have a problem with your little sexual innuendo?}
<C>__{erit}
<D>__{what is up your ass tonight??}
<A>__{mick throws john a "this is all your fault and now it is going to explode" look. john feigns complete innocence.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{so, i shouldn't take offense that you're coming on to my husband right in front of me.}
<C>__{erit}
<P>__{(claws out now)}
<D>__{lara, if i wanted your husband i would have him.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{how? you couldn't possibly show him more of your tits.}
<A>__{the men are on their feet before blows are exchanged.}
<C>__{erit}
<D>__{ you know what your problem is?!}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{that was a great meal!}
<C>__{mick}
<D>__{okay okay!}
