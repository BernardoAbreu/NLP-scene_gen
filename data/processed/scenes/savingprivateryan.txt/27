<L>__{exterior road leading from intelligence tent day}
<A>__{miller and his men peel out, now with upham crammed with the others in the back of the jeep. as they drive off, the camera cranes up to reveal the vast tableau of the biggest invasion in military history. the scope of the operation is stunning. the beach is covered with mountains of supplies. a steady stream of vehicles winds up the dunes. hundreds of barrage balloons, anchored by heavy steel cables, hover over the entire scene. off shore, a massive mulberry port is under construction, workers swarming over it like ants. beyond that, thousands of ships and boats of every type and description. the smoke of hundreds of fires rises on the horizon. explosions, some distant, some close, boom and rumble. it's an awesome, breathtaking sight. miller and his tiny band of men, weave their way through the middle of it, speeding away from the beach, heading inland, leaving the bulk of the american army behind. exterior french road day miller and his men drive fast passing american vehicles and infantrymen moving forward. the sides of the road are littered with the debris of burning german vehicles, abandoned equipment, bodies. sarge drives. miller reads a map. upham, cradling a pristine m 1 rifle, is all eyes and ears. jackson and wade calmly take in the view. reiben checks out the close quarters in the back of the jeep.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{captain, can i ask you a question?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{sure, reiben.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{where are you planning on putting private ryan, sir?}
<A>__{miller doesn't raise his eyes from the map.}
<C>__{reiben}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it's just that it's kind of crowded back here, i was wondering if you're expecting to have more room on the way back?}
<A>__{miller points out a turn to sarge.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{left.}
<A>__{sarge makes the turn. miller folds up the map and pockets it.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{now we've got a straight shot, due north, to ramelle, twenty six miles, two villages between here and there, st. mere, then bernay. we'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{we in radio contact with anybody up there?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the hundred and first's radios the night before the drop, not one of them works. we're going in blind.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{i usually like surprises.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{what are we likely to run into?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{a fucking mess, two maybe three kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on. command says we hold st. mere, but north of that, it's all krauts. even if ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{hell of a mission.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{yep, hell of a mission.}
<B>__{in the back of the jeep}
<A>__{upham avidly takes in everything. he notices reiben staring at him, grows nervous under his look and offers a hopeful smile. upham hi. so, uh, you're all rangers? reiben, jackson and wade look at upham as if he were an insect. upham i'm upham. (pointing at his corporal's stripes) ignore these, please, i know all that breaks down in combat. their jaws drop.}
<C>__{reiben}
<P>__{(to wade)}
<D>__{you want to shoot him, or should i?}
<A>__{wade it's not my turn.}
<C>__{reiben}
<P>__{(politely)}
<D>__{jackson?}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{hell, no, last time i shot a corporal, cap'n miller near bit my head off.}
<A>__{upham reacts to the metion of miller's name. upham miller?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i don't want anybody to shoot him, that's an order. he speaks french and his german has a touch of the bavarian.}
<A>__{upham sir, are you captain john miller? miller sighs, he knows what's coming.}
<C>__{upham}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...who won the congressional medal of hon...?}
<A>__{upham's words are frozen in his throat by the warning glances of miller's men. miller himself remains relaxed but stone faced. no one speaks for a few seconds, then the moment passes as if it had never happened.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{captain, i gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{yeah, how so?}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{i should be on my way to caen, sir. it's like beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf. go figure, i mean, who'd he piss off? and here i am, the beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, i'm going to ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{there's to be a bright side, look for it.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{sir, you know what ramelle is famous for? cheese. the rest of the company is going to caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of france. there is no bright side.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{there's always a bright side.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{i'm listening, sir.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{well, i, for one, like cheese.}
<A>__{wade pipes up cheerfully. wade hell, i don't mind going to ramelle, as long as there's something up there for me to blow up.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{well, you're a happy idiot.}
<B>__{they round a turn}
