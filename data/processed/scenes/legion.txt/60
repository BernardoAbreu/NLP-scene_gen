<A>__{michael and bob are tying sandra to a chair. not like it looks like she's capable of going anywhere, but you never know. across the diner, charlie eyes michael cautiously. michael never goes for more than a few moments without looking up at her. it's not lecherous. more like a protective father making sure his child hasn't strayed too far. in a booth, audrey watches, red eyed, as michael restrains her mother. then she returns her attention to percy's radio. tuning. trying to find something, anything in the static. she brings her ear up close. wait. is that a voice? she adjusts the antenna, trying to bring the signal into focus. clearer.}

<A>__{clearer. yes. it's a voice!}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{hey! you guys, i think i got something here!}
<A>__{everyone drops what they're doing and quickly gathers around the radio. through the haze of static, a gravely, tired voice. strained}
