<L>__{exterior sidewalk day}
<A>__{amy breaks through the doors of the building. she hits two of the ten stairs down to the sidewalk. people walking by hardly notice. up ahead, a police car is turning down the street. she stops and walks calmly, diverting her eyes. the police car races by, and amy walks faster, and faster, then runs.}
<L>__{interior amy's hotel room night}
<A>__{close on a tray of ice being cracked apart. it's contents poured into a open towel. amy is sitting on the floor in front of her couch, now dressed in only panties and a bra an image unpleasantly reminiscent of marla especially with the spotting of bruises and roughly bandaged scrapes on her pale skin. she has a dripping ice pack in one hand, which she applies to this bruise and that and a bottle of gin in the other. she doesn't look happy. she takes a drink, then looks toward a tv and vcr in front of her. there's a tape half inserted into the vcr. we can see the empty envelope with "amy" written on it, lying on the floor. he tape is within reach of amy's bare foot, and she lifts a toe toward it, hesitant. she puts her toe against the tape...hanging on the edge of decision. finally, she shoves it forward with her toe. it slides into the machine. she grabs up the remote and turns on the set. the image appears. it's marla, looking like she hasn't slept in days, sitting on a chair in her apartment staring into camera. her eyes are glazed, distant. but she looks a hell of lot better than she did in the bathroom.}

<P>__{(a little sad)}
<D>__{i knew you'd come. course if you're watching this tape, it's already too late for me. but maybe you can stop it.}
<A>__{amy removes the puzzle box from her satchel. stares at it.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{he promised us pleasures beyond anything we could ever imagine. we just had to fight through the pain first. easier said than done.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{don't open the box amy. if you do winter wins, and if he wins }
<A>__{someone pounds on a door. marla panics.}
<C>__{marla}
<P>__{(hurried)}
<D>__{go to pletkow station at midnight. go to the south end of the platform and step onto the last car. find a guy named joey who runs the show and tell him i sent you. he'll guide you to them.}
<A>__{the pounding gets louder.}
<C>__{winter }
<D>__{marla!}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{save them amy. please...}
<C>__{winter }
<D>__{marla!}
<A>__{marla leaps forward and }
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{those you trust the most trust the least.}
<A>__{ shuts off the camera. it goes black for a few seconds, and then cuts to snow. amy sits, staring at the snow, her face empty. she sets the puzzle box on the table and stares at it. takes a sip of her drink.}
<C>__{amy }
<D>__{don't open it. right.}
<A>__{phone rings. it shakes amy out of her fugue. she leans over picks up the receiver. an old style phone.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{yeah...}
