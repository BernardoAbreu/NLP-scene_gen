<L>__{exterior archer's home (santa monica) sunset}
<A>__{a renovated craftsman. sipping a carton of milk, archer pulls into the driveway. he sits, gathering his thoughts.}
<L>__{interior archer's home night}
<A>__{archer enters and sees his wife eve. handsome, intelligent.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{hi...}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{... what's wrong?}
<A>__{she nods toward the kitchen. jamie is there a sullen and hard fifteen year old. there are cigarette cartons on the table.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{she complimented for her 'f' in history with an 'a' in shoplifting...}
<A>__{archer marches into the kitchen noting the crate of marlboros. jamie matter of factly pours herself coffee.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{nice stunt, jamie. you break the law and i'm expected to ignore it?}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{that's right it's all about you. don't even ask me what happened.}
<A>__{archer looks to eve for help. eve shakes her head nope.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{okay. what happened?}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{like you'd ever fucking believe me!}
<A>__{she bolts. in anticipation, eve calmly opens the door as jamie rushes out, then closes it behind her.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{well, you tried. you failed miserably, but you tried.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{why won't she even talk to me?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{maybe because you taught her never to speak to strangers.}
<P>__{(immediately regrets it)}
<D>__{i'm sorry... that wasn't fair.}
<A>__{eve kisses his cheek then gathers up her doctor gear.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i've got patients waiting. try again, jon. she hates you but she needs you.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{eve...}
<A>__{something in archer's expression makes her stop.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{jon what is it?}
<A>__{but he's too overcome. he starts to speak but can't.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{is it him? it's... it's over?}
<A>__{emotions avalanche across his face until he finally looks up. eve pulls him close a sheltering embrace for them both.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{i'm going to make everything up to you and jamie. i will put in for a desk job. we'll go away, get counseling anything you want. this time, i mean it.}
