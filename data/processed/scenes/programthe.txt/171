<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{it's autumn isn't it? that's what this is all about.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{the hell with autumn. you just can't take a hit.}
<A>__{infuriated, darnell goes for ray, and they start swinging. darnell tackles ray, they roll on the floor, still swinging, trying to beat the shit out of each other. finally, several players manage to pull them apart. coach winters charges over.}

<D>__{don't tell me who started it. i don't care. all i care about is this football team. we win together. we lose together. so whatever your problem is, get over it. i don't want any more of this shit. understand?}

<D>__{as for the rest of you guys. here's what i think of the way you played.}
<A>__{winters walks over to a table set up with 75 cups of orange juice and gatorade. he swipes the cups off the table creating a small flood on the floor. then turns the table over. the players are shocked. they've seldom seen him like this.}

<A>__{winters walks away, as the players are left to contemplate their mistakes. winters goes over to joe.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{get warm, joe. you're startin' the second half.}
<A>__{joe nods, excited but uncertain. winters moves on to ray griffen.}
