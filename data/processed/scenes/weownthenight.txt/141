<L>__{interior police station muster room}
<A>__{many cops, mug shots and files strewn all over. a discussion, in media res. many cops approach bobby, all of whom shake his hand, ad libbing whispered "hey, bobby" and "welcome to the force." bobby thanks them, then moves to stand behind his brother. michael testily grills jack on the investigative progress:}
<C>__{michael solo}
<D>__{...but we got our guys out there, working the street all over? i mean, they coupeing or they working?}
<C>__{jack shapiro}
<D>__{everybody's out there, bustin' balls, left and right! what else you want us to do?}
<A>__{as michael says the following dialog, a uniformed officer comes up to bobby. sotto, in his ear, he speaks to him:}
<C>__{uniformed officer}
<D>__{bobby, a rosario diaz's been callin' for you. she says she needs to talk to you.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{thanks. i will call her back.}
<C>__{michael solo }
<D>__{well, you tell narcotics queens we got an a 1 sale hanging over our head and either they help us or we fuckin' take it out on `em later!}
<A>__{the uniformed officer leaves, and bobby stays put to hear this exchange.}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{what about nezhinski's uncle? that clubowner marat buzhayev?}
<C>__{jack shapiro}
<D>__{clean. we tailed him for weeks. goes out with his grandkids, takes `em horseriding at floyd bennett field... checks on his fur business from time to time we even looked at some of the coats and tore `em apart. turned out to be fake sable, if you could believe it.}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{it's comin' up quick, we don't know anything... we're gonna lose it...}
<C>__{michael solo}
<D>__{joe this is still new territory for all of us. i mean, we hadda use your brother here to get any results to begin with.}
<A>__{michael points to bobby, who up until now had been focused on and concerned by his brother's behavior.}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{i know that. and my family takes the hit my family...}
<A>__{an awkward silence. everyone's pained. bobby stiffens:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{could you guys go outside for a minute? i wanna talk to my brother.}
<A>__{michael hesitates, then nods. everyone wheels around and exits the room. jack follows mike out the door. bobby turns to his brother:}
<C>__{bobby green }
<D>__{you're trying to do everything it's gonna kill you.}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<P>__{(shrugs ruefully)}
<D>__{we don't got much time...we lose nezhinski, we're both dead... [the] streets'll get flooded, the whole city's gonna be on fire }
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{we could handle it. i mean, i come on to help you }
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{well, i didn't ask you to do that. i don't need your help i could deal with it on my own.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{i know. but you don't gotta do everything yourself. that's what i'm trying to tell you.}
<A>__{bobby eyes joseph, who looks deeply troubled. bobby sits.}
<C>__{bobby green }
<D>__{joe, what's wrong? come on, you can tell me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{a deal this big, something's gonna come up. you'll see someone'll fold.}
<A>__{joseph ponders for a beat, then comes out with it:}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{it's not that. it's just... you give up what you wanted to do to be here, bobby. and part of me feels a little responsible.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{nah, you didn't do nothing. it's meant to be. you can't fuckin' control it...}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<P>__{(slight laugh)}
<D>__{you know, i remember when pop was mad at you, he always used to say you didn't believe in our family. and mom, she'd protect you. she'd give you those little caramels... anyway, i knew he was wrong too, but i didn't say nothing.}
<A>__{just then: the uniformed officer knocks and re enters:}
<C>__{uniformed officer}
<D>__{bobby, rosario diaz just called again.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{tell her i'm on my way back now.}
<P>__{(to joseph)}
<D>__{don't worry.}
<C>__{bobby green }
<D>__{that's all in the past.}
<P>__{(kisses him)}
<D>__{i will see you later.}
