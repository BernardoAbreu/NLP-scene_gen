<A>__{a steady downpour falls outside the porch. dwight and toby, both stripped to the waist, are boxing. dwight is totally serious about this, absolutely sincere. the sweat streaming off the two, dwight patiently corrects toby's movements, or catches the boy's fist to suggest better form. their feet shuffle, squeak on the floor.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{no, no. from the shoulder. straight.}
<P>__{(demonstrates)}
<D>__{like this. this. otherwise you leave yourself wide open.}
<P>__{(as toby tries)}
<D>__{yeah, better, better... and keep those feet moving, shuffle, shuffle, that's right... now try for my face... good...}
