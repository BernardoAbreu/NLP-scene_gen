<L>__{interior brenner kitchen med. shot melanie}
<A>__{at the kitchen stove, taking a kettle of tea from the burner. she pours it into a cup, puts the cup on a tray already set with sugar and creamer. she looks up as mitch comes into the kitchen. two shot melanie and mitch}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{that was al on the phone. he wants me to meet him out at the fawcett place. says some detectives from santa rosa'll be there in a little while.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{will you be all right here?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{yes. i was just taking her in some tea.}
<A>__{he goes to her, puts his arms around her from behind, kisses her hair. but she turns in his arms suddenly and clings to him fiercely, and then buries her head in his shoulder.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{be careful. please.}
<A>__{she walks him to the door. at the door, they kiss a long, full kiss. full shot the kitchen as mitch goes out. melanie looks after him for a moment, and then picks up the tray. outside, we hear the sound of his car starting. the camera follows melanie out of the kitchen, through the dining room, and to one of the bedroom doors on the other side of the house. gently, she knocks.}
<C>__{lydia }
<D>__{mitch?}
<A>__{full shot the bedroom this is lydia's room, and cluttered with the mementos of a life no longer valid. there are photographs of her dead husband, souvenirs of trips taken together, bric a brac of mitch's childhood. under it all, there is a distinct femininity. she sits up in bed as melanie enters, bearing the tray.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{no, it's me, mrs. brenner. i thought you might like some tea.}
<A>__{two shot lydia and melanie}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{oh, thank you.}
<A>__{there is a long silence as melanie puts the tray on the bed, arranges the pillows behind lydia.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{where's mitch?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{al malone wanted him out at the fawcett farm.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{why? didn't al believe my story?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{he was calling from the farm, mrs. brenner.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{then he saw.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{he must have. he sent for the santa rosa police.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{what good will they do?}
<A>__{she sips at the tea. there is a long awkward pause. melanie walks to the window and looks out over the bay.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{do you think cathy's all right?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{cathy. at the school.}
<A>__{close shot melanie at the window, her face turned away from lydia. her expression clearly shows that she doesn't know whether cathy is all right. but when she turns to lydia, there is a comforting smile on her face, and her voice is soothing.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{yes, i'm sure she's fine.}
<A>__{two shot melanie and lydia}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{do i sound foolish to you?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{i keep seeing dan fawcett's face.}
<P>__{(she shudders)}
<D>__{they have such big windows at the school.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{all the windows were broken. in dan's bedroom. all the windows.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{try not to think of that, mrs. brenner.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{i wish i were a stronger person. there is a long awkward silence. she sips at her tea reflectively.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{i lost my husband four years ago, you know.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i'd love to relax some time. i'd love to be able to sleep.}
<P>__{(pause; the worried look again)}
<D>__{do you think cathy's all right?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{annie's there. she'll be all right.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{i'm not this way, you know. not usually. i don't fuss and fret over my children.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{when frank died...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you see, he knew the children, he really knew them. he had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. that's a rare talent.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{i wish i could be that way.}
<A>__{there is another silence. a curious thing is happening in this room. lydia, for perhaps the first time since her husband's death, is discussing it with another person. curiously, the person is melanie.}
<C>__{lydia}
<P>__{(honestly and simply)}
<D>__{i miss him.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you know, sometimes i wake up in the morning, and i think 'i have to make frank's breakfast,' and i... i get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, i remember.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i miss talking to him.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{cathy's a child, you know, and mitch...}
<P>__{(she shrugs a little sadly)}
<D>__{...mitch has his own life.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i'm glad he stayed here today. i feel safer with him here.}
<P>__{(she sighs deeply)}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{would you like to rest now, mrs. brenner.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{no. no... don't go yet.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i feel as if i... i don't understand you. and i want so much to understand.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{why, mrs. brenner?}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{because my son is...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{my son seems to be fond of you.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{and i...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i'm not quite sure how i feel about it. i really don't know if i... like you or not.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{is that so important, mrs. brenner? you liking me?}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{yes, i think so. my son is important to me. i want to like any girl he chooses.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{and if you don't?}
<C>__{lydia}
<P>__{(with a faint smile)}
<D>__{then i don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i think it might also matter to mitch.}
<C>__{lydia}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i'm not complaining. that's the mark of a man. but...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you see, i... i wouldn't want to be... be left alone. i don't think i could bear being left alone. i... forgive me. this business with the birds has me upset. i... i don't know what i'd do if mitch weren't here.}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(going to the bed; adjusting the pillow)}
<D>__{why don't you try to sleep now, mrs. brenner.}
<C>__{lydia}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{i wish i were stronger.}
<P>__{(she pauses and looks toward the window.)}
<D>__{do you think she's all right? do you think she's safe at the school?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{would you like me to go for her?}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{i couldn't ask you to.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i don't mind, really.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{would you? i'd feel so much better.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i will just clear up here, and then dress.}
<A>__{she picks up the tray and starts for the door.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{melanie?}
<A>__{at the door, melanie turns. close shot lydia her face soft.}
<C>__{lydia}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{thank you for the tea.}
