<L>__{exterior diner afternoon}
<A>__{a single car is parked in the dirt lot outside the small, roadside diner. superimpose: de kalb, illinois. july 10, 1928 changeling a true story}
<L>__{interior diner continuous}
<A>__{the cook who owns this dive is cleaning the griddle and keeping an eye on the only two customers in the place: a man and a young boy, both wearing hats, as was the custom. they're unkempt, dirty, like they've been on the road a long time. they finish the last of the food as the cook approaches, tears off the bill and puts it on the table.}
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{two dollars.}
<A>__{the man reaches for his wallet. pats an empty pocket. tries the other pocket. nothing.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{hell...looks like i left my wallet at home. can i owe it to you?}
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{no credit. pay up or i call the cops. i'm tired of bums like you coming around here.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{i'm not trying to stiff you, chief. i just left my wallet at home, that's all. i will go back and get it. five, ten minutes tops.}
<A>__{the cook hesitates; he doesn't want the trouble of bringing in the cops, but he doesn't want to get stuck, either.}
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{you got any collateral?}
<A>__{the man glances at the boy seated beside him. the boy's face is dirty, partially obscured by the hat.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{can't ask for better collateral than a man's own flesh and blood, right?}
<P>__{(to the boy)}
<D>__{you stay here, son, i will be right back.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{but }
<C>__{man}
<D>__{now don't give me any trouble. he's a good man to trust us like this. you just sit here while i go get my wallet. okay?}
<A>__{changeling a true story the boy nods reluctantly, looks away as the man rises.}
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{ten minutes, then i'm calling the cops.}
<A>__{the man nods, exits and drives off. the cook squints warily at the boy, then at the wall clock. it's 2:00.}
