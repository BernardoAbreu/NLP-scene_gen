<L>__{ext: late afternoon the streets in the barrio montage}
<A>__{lt stumbles through the streets, questioning people about "julio and paolo". no one knows anything. lt stops people at random, getting really desperate. he shows people the chalice, asks them if they've seen it before. no one has. lt plays both addict and cop as it suits his needs. by now, he looks more like a homeless man than anything else. but none of his play acting or lethal threats get him anywhere. the game is everywhere, and the mets are still losing. finally, lt approaches a hustling street dealer. he cops. the street dealer is wearing a walkman, so the deal goes down in mime. now, lt speaks and wants to be heard.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{hey have you seen paolo or julio around?}
<A>__{the street dealer uses his walkman and the resulting "deafness" to excuse his total lack of response. lt starts mouthing words silently at the street dealer. no response. then, he silently begins to shout. the street dealer's alarmed that he seemingly can't hear at all above the walkman music. he moves the walkman away from his ears but doesn't take it off.}
<C>__{street dealer}
<D>__{what the fuck you want.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{you know, my uncle used to wear a walkman all the time. the walkman looked just like yours. and you look something like my uncle. but one day he was standing in a puddle the puddle locked just like that one }
<A>__{lt points to a puddle in which the street dealer is now standing.}
<C>__{street dealer}
<D>__{and what?}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{and he got electrocuted.}
<A>__{the street dealer tries to consider what this crazy guy has just told him, but before the street dealer can even react. lt leans in on him, shows his gun and then his badge.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{look i don't know you, and you don't know me, but i'm really in the mood to kill someone today and you are at the end of my gun.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{have you ever had days like that? yeah, you have, so now you understand where i'm coming from.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{tell me! where is julio and paolo ?}
<A>__{the street dealer answers with absolute ease. that was all it was about? no problem.}
<C>__{street dealer}
<D>__{they were at that abandoned building last night. second floor. they're probably still there now. it's next to the old convent. downtown a ways. you know the place...}
<A>__{cu. lt it hits him. the crackhouse where the kids hang out has always been right next to the church convent where it an began! it suddenly makes sense to him. lt completes re transaction, pays the street dealer for the drug bags. he takes the cash out of the cigar box, revealing dozens of thousands of dollars. the street dealer stares at the wretched man with a box full of cash.}
