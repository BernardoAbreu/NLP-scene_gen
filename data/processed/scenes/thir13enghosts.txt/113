<A>__{the hammer swings on rafkin, who dodges the attack. the strike whacks the glass, sparks fly, arthur reacts.}

<P>__{(getting cocky)}
<D>__{that the best you can do? my mother hits harder than that.}
<A>__{the hammer's now enraged. he swings again... and again rafkin dodges the strikes, bobbing and weaving, like ali in the ring.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{you ain't got no speed, old man. what's the matter, that hammer weighing you down?}
<A>__{the hammer's swinging wildly, but rafkin, surprisingly, has quicker reflexes, and it's pissing the hammer off. rafkin evades another attack, and out of the corner of his eye, he spots the breaker turning the corner... from his massive size, he realizes who it is.}

<D>__{mother of christ...}
<A>__{arthur sees the breaker approaching. he grows larger as he gets closer...}
