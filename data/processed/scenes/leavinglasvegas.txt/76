<L>__{interior bank day}
<A>__{ben waiting in line again. the same bank girl is there and she is dealing with her customers in the same inanely cheerful way that the game show hostess dealt with her prize winners. she notices ben waiting and an irritated look flashes over across her face. ben studies her. she is pretty in an ordinary kind of way. we hear ben's thoughts as voice over (or maybe he says them out loud to himself).}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{are you desirable? are you irresistible? maybe if you drank bourbon with me, it would help. maybe if you kissed me and i could taste the sting in your mouth, it would help.}
<A>__{close up on the bank girl as she does her thing, efficiently counting money, smiling, perfect teeth framed by a cupid mouth. she is wearing a white blouse through which frilly lingerie can just be made out.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{if you drank bourbon with me naked... if you smelled of bourbon as you fucked me, it would help... it would increase my esteem for you. if you poured bourbon on to your naked body and said to me... drink this...}
<A>__{camera moves in tighter on her face as she chats with a customer about the weather.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{... if you spread your legs and had bourbon dripping from your breasts and you vagina and said drink here... then i could fall in love with you, because then i would have a purpose, to clean you up, and that would prove that i'm worth something. id lick you clean so you could go away and fuck someone else.}
<C>__{bank girl}
<D>__{next!}
<A>__{ben takes a moment to come out of his reverie. he smiles and comes to the counter, completely in control of himself.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm back, i've got my check... and baby... i'm ready to sign.}
<A>__{he flips the check over, makes sure she is watching and signs with a flourish.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{there... steady as a fucking rock, excuse my french.}
<P>__{(serious)}
<D>__{wanna have dinner with me?}
<A>__{she counts the money out and glares at him as she hands it over.}
<C>__{bank girl}
<D>__{i'm glad you're feeling better. do you need a validation?}
<A>__{ben looks at her and smiles.}
