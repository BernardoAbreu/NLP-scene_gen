<A>__{gallagher heads down. bounding down the hill. no algae on his side. he leaves a trail of phosphorescent footprints as he goes. they grow fainter and fainter as he descends.}

<A>__{it's been sitting there for 30 years. as he approaches, the solar panels turn and track towards his light. it's still waiting. sits on six over built legs. sample return vehicle launches off the base. liquid fuel tanks, sample return container the size of a large trash can. we hear }
<C>__{bowman }
<D>__{how you doing?}
<C>__{gallagher}
<P>__{(unsettled)}
<D>__{it's really cold. my fingers aren't sure they want to work.}
<C>__{bowman }
<D>__{you can do this.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{the maintenance port has a cover. it should be marked.}
<A>__{gallagher looks it over. minor stumbling block...}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{yeah. in cyrillic.}
<A>__{finds it anyhow. he flexes his unresponsive fingers, and after a try or two, unscrews the cover, reveals an ir port.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{got it.}
<C>__{bowman }
<D>__{all right, i'm gonna download this to you.}
<A>__{gallagher yanks out his hhc. dozen adapters in the back. finds the one that fits the old modem port on the jerry rigged radio.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{go.}
<A>__{plugs it in. stuff flashes. on the hhc, windows comes up, the cosmos launchmaster program, cyrillic crudely relabeled in english. unplugs the modem so he can speak again.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{it's still got power.}
<C>__{bowman }
<D>__{you should be able to run diagnostics.}
<A>__{there's a diagnostics check and launch check. he hits diagnostics. the two talk, link up, and a windows error screen comes up on the hhc: "warning your system has become busy or unstable. press ctrl alt delete to exit programs and reboot."}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{i know now why it didn't launch.}
<P>__{(says the magic words)}
<D>__{control alt delete.}
<A>__{reboots in the blink of an eye. systems check positive.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{it's looking good.}
<C>__{bowman }
<D>__{okay, this thing only has two settings. on and off. one sends it all the way back to earth. as you don't have air, food or water, that would be bad.}
