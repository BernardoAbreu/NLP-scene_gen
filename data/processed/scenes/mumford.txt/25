<D>__{ practices.}
<A>__{lionel is sitting across the room, making an ardent case }
<C>__{lionel}

<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{protect your turf! check this guy out. i smell a rat, i tell you.}
<A>__{delbanco and sheeler exchange a look; they find lionel distasteful.}
<C>__{sheeler}
<D>__{mr. dillard, i'm sure dr. delbanco shares my gratitude for your concern. but i also know he'd agree that you misunderstand the nature of our calling to mental health. we're not in some... widget business, trying to crush our competition.}

<D>__{what the hell's a widget?}
