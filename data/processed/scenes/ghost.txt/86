<B>__{sam and the ghost}
<A>__{sitting in the corner of a deserted subway station. sam is trying desperately to push a bottle cap with his finger.}
<C>__{ghost}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what are you doing? what are you doing? you can't push it with your finger. you're dead.}
<A>__{the ghost demonstrates, kicking a garbage pail onto its side. sam can't quite tell how he did it.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i don't get it.}
<C>__{ghost}
<D>__{it's your mind, you idiot. it's all in the mind. the problem is you think you're still real, that you're standin' on the floor, that you're wearin' those clothes. bullshit! you don't even have a body anymore. it's all up here. you wanna move things, you gotta use your mind. you gotta focus! you hear what i'm saying?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{how do you focus?}
<C>__{ghost}
<D>__{i don't know how you focus! you just focus!}
<A>__{with surprising energy, the ghost flicks a bottle cap and sends it shooting across the subway platform.}
<C>__{ghost}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it's all in the anger. you gotta direct it. you gotta channel it.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm angry all the time. it doesn't do a thing.}
<C>__{ghost}
<D>__{cause you're angry all over. you gotta be angry here, in the pit of your stomach. bring it down here. let it explode.}
<P>__{(he makes an explosive gesture)}
<D>__{it's like a reactor, you know. pow!}
<A>__{he kicks a coke can toward sam. sam tries to kick it back and misses. the ghost laughs. sam gets angry. he tries again and falls on his head. the ghost laughs louder. now sam is really angry. we see him forcing the anger down into his stomach. he holds still for a moment and then kicks at the can with all his might. to his shock and amazement, it sails right through the ghost's head. the ghost smiles.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i did it!}
<C>__{ghost}
<D>__{way to go.}
