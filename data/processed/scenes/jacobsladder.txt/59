<L>__{interior law office day}
<A>__{jacob, frank, jerry, george, doug, and rod are sitting on plush chairs in the law office of donald geary. geary, a red faced man with three chins, is sucking on an ice cube. he looks at each of the men, and then spits the ice cube into an empty glass. it clinks.}
<C>__{geary}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mr. singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? it'd break your heart.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{this isn't injustice, mr. geary. the army did something to us and we've got to find out what.}
<C>__{geary}
<D>__{the army. the army. what is it with you guys? we're not talking about a trip to the library here. this is the united states government for god's sake. this is red tape coming out of your ass. you know what i mean?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{exactly. and we need someone to cut through it. we hear you're the man.}
<C>__{geary}
<D>__{oh yeah? what am i perry mason here?}
<A>__{geary stands up and grabs a bag of cheetos from a file drawer. he chomps down a few and offers the bag to the others. there are no takers. thirsty, he downs the ice cube and cracks it between his teeth.}
<C>__{geary}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{okay. i will look into it.}
<A>__{the men are surprised and excited.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{wow! do you think we have a chance?}
<C>__{geary}
<D>__{what do you want, a fortune teller or a lawyer? ... i will need sworn depositions from each of you and a list of the other members of the platoon, or their survivors.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{hey, this is great.}
<C>__{geary}
<D>__{i will tell you, if we find the military is implicated in any way, you could stand to recover quite a lot of money. not that i can predict anything, but some class action suits of this kind have been awarded fairly generous judgements. that wouldn't be so bad, would it mr. singer?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{doctor.}
<P>__{(geary looks at him oddly)}
<D>__{ph.d.}
<C>__{geary}
<D>__{ah! i thought you were a mailman.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{geary}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{then why aren't you teaching? why aren't you in a university?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i'm too messed up to teach.}
<C>__{geary}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{ah! well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they?}
<A>__{the men all nod in agreement.}
