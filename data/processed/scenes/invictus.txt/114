<A>__{we are in a courtyard behind the palace. drawn by four white horses, a royal carriage (an open carriage) pulls up, stops. the courtyard quickly fills with liveried footmen, then security guards. queen elisabeth and mandela emerge from the palace. footmen open doors on both sides of the carriage. the queen and mandela climb in (the queen on the right hand side). when they sit down next to each other, mandela leans over and says something to the queen that makes her giggle ... ... almost. for queens do not giggle. the carriage pulls forward and these two human icons sit up straight, as they get set to face the world.}
