<L>__{interior trevor's living room}
<A>__{as trevor approaches the couch, eyes focused on rita's soda.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(preoccupied)}
<D>__{ask yourself this question. is pride really that important?}
<A>__{now he looks up and freezes. quickly turns away. rita, lying on the couch, completely naked. not sexual in the least. more like a distorted offering. or a patient, placidly waiting for her doctor.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(plainly)}
<D>__{put your clothes on, rita.}
<A>__{an awkward moment. chagrin becomes repressed sobs as rita picks up her pile of clothes off the floor and gets dressed. this is one fucked up little girl.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(affected)}
<D>__{no harm done... don't cry now.}
<A>__{fully dressed again, remotely staring, rita holds back tears. trevor sits down on the couch next to her. opens textbook.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{why don't you go ahead and copy the first rule there for the verb 'to be.' can you do that for me?}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(hiccups a sob)}
<D>__{i jus' wan'ed to thank you.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{you don't have to thank me, i'm your teacher.}
<A>__{rita opens her notebook and begins to copy the rule. she wipes at the tears with the sleeve of her baggy sweat shirt. trevor resists the urge to comfort her.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{... from now on i think the best thing for us to do is meet in the library.}
