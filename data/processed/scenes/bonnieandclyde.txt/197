<A>__{bright afternoon. camera across the street from an ice cream parlor. sign about it: "eva's hand packed ice cream." a large plate glass window fronts the store, and through it we can see the people inside seated at tables and booths. prominent in our vision is malcolm moss, seated, facing camera. he is seated across from another man, but we see him from the back. malcolm is obviously doing a lot of talking and then some hard listening; gesticulating and looking disturbed. after a bit of this, he rises from the table and begins walking toward the door. the other man rises and turns. we now see that it is frank hamer. malcolm and hamer come out onto the sidewalk, squinting in the sunlight. malcolm mimes some social pleasantries by way of saying "goodbye," but hamer's face shows no emotion of recognition of the gesture. he turns and walks away, walking out of the frame. malcolm stands where he is, in front of the ice cream parlor. by the expression on his face, we can see that he is rather disturbed by what he has heard and that he is still grappling with the problem.}
