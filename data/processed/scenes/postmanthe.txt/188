<A>__{the postman smiles in relief as ford lowers the revolver and starts to hand the weapon over. forgotten for an instant, bethlehem makes a last, wild lunge, grabs ford's gun. as bethlehem aims at the postman, a shot rings out. hit in the chest, bethlehem blinks in amazement before he falls to the ground, dying. getty has shot him.}
