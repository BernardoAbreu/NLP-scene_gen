<L>__{exterior abandoned freeway. night.}
<A>__{marlon and truman, both nursing bottles of beer, sit on the end of their abandoned freeway off ramp.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{people know who i am, my every move, complete strangers know my name. even when there's no one around, i feel the eyes on me.}
<C>__{marlon}
<P>__{(reluctant admission)}
<D>__{i was in the bank today. the federal on lewis. a clerk was talking about somebody named truman messing with her baby. is that the stranger you're talking about?}
<A>__{truman closes his eyes as he takes in the explanation.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(half to himself, refusing to accept it)}
<D>__{no. no. i've never seen her before.}
<P>__{(registering marlon's skepticism)}
<D>__{i know you already think i'm going out of my mind but i genuinely believe the world revolves around me somehow. everybody seems to be in on it.}
<C>__{marlon}
<D>__{it's a lot of world for one man. you sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? christ, truman, who hasn't sat on the john and had an imaginary interview with barbara walters? who hasn't wanted to be somebody?}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{that's just it. i think i am somebody.}
<C>__{marlon}
<P>__{(sympathetizing)}
<D>__{i used to dream all my friends and family got together in a hotel room, thinking of ways to fuck me up.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{sometimes i think it's in my head, sometimes i think it's for real.}
<A>__{marlon looks around as if drawing inspiration from somewhere in the night.}
<C>__{marlon}
<D>__{tru, we've known each other since before we could get a hard on.}
<A>__{truman half smiles at the ribald remark.}
<C>__{marlon}
<D>__{the only way we ever made it through high school was cheating off each other's test papers. jesus, they were identical. i always liked that, because whatever the answer was, we was right together and we was wrong together.}
<A>__{truman nods fondly at the memory.}
<C>__{marlon}
<D>__{the only night either of us ever spent in jail, we spent together and i wet myself but you never told anyone. i was best man at your wedding and my brother was best man at my wedding and you didn't talk to me for a month over that and i didn't blame you because you've been more of a brother to me than he's ever been. and i never shoulda let my goddam father talk me into that.}
<A>__{truman is slowly coming around. marlon's speech from the heart soothing away his pain.}
<C>__{marlon}
<D>__{i know things haven't worked out for either of us like we used to sit up on freemont street all night and dream they would. we all let opportunities pass us by, none of us asks for the dance as often as we should. i know that feeling when it's like everything's slipping away and you don't want to believe it so you look for answers someplace else. but, well, the point is, i would gladly step in front of traffic for you.}
<A>__{truman grins a melancholy grin, nearly all the way back. we see a close up of marlon's ear. from inside, unheard by truman, christof dictates marlon's heartfelt speech.}
