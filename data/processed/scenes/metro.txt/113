<L>__{interior garage day}
<A>__{roper moves up an interior stairway, gun in "ready" position. he knows korda is somewhere in the parking structure. he glides up the stairway to the third level. checks back over the rail... no one around... then a sound from inside the garage... footsteps maybe. roper carefully opens the door... swings in with his gun...}
<L>__{interior third level garage}
<A>__{lots of cars, but no one in sight. roper moves quickly to the protection of a row of cars... he crouches down. scans beneath the cars... no sign of korda. roper searches between two rows... comes up beside a van... thinks he hears something stirring inside. whirls a gun toward the window. a dog lunges at the camera... snarling... baring teeth... roper moves on.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{as a bmw crawls through the parking structure. roper steps into the foreground, right into its path, gun visible. the bmw rolls to a stop. roper approaches with caution. roper comes up beside the car and sees a very frightened 30 year old blonde. roper takes a check out of the backseat.}
