<T>__{dissolve out: dissolve in:}
<L>__{interior city room enquirer building day }
<A>__{the whole floor is now a city room. it is twice its former size, yet not too large for all the desks and the people using them. the windows have been enlarged, providing a good deal more light and air. a wall calendar says september 9th. kane and bernstein enter and stand in the entrance a moment. kane, who really did look a bit peaked before, is now clear eyed and tanned. he is wearing new english clothes. as they come into the room, bernstein practically walking sideways, is doing nothing but beaming and admiring kane, quelling like a mother at the carnegie hall debut of her son. seeing and recognizing kane, the entire staff rises to its feet.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(referring to the staff; with a smile)}
<D>__{ask them to sit down, mr. bernstein.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{sit down, everybody for heaven's sake!}
<A>__{the order is immediately obeyed, everybody going into business of feverish activity.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{so then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh? especially the new papers }
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{we certainly do. vacation's over starting right after dinner. but right now that lady over there }
<P>__{(he indicates a woman at the desk)}
<D>__{ that's the new society editor, i take it? you think i could interrupt her a moment, mr. bernstein?}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{huh? oh, i forgot you've been away so long i forgot about your joking }
<A>__{he trails after kane as he approaches the society editor's desk. the society editor, a middle aged spinster, sees him approaching and starts to quake all over, but tries to pretend she isn't aware of him. an envelope in her hand shakes violently. kane and bernstein stop at her desk.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{miss townsend }
<A>__{miss townsend looks up and is so surprised to see bernstein with a stranger.}
<C>__{miss townsend}
<D>__{good afternoon, mr. bernstein.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{this is mr. kane, miss townsend.}
<A>__{miss townsend can't stick to her plan. she starts to rise, but her legs are none too good under her. she knocks over a tray of copy paper as she rises, and bends to pick it up.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(very hesitatingly and very softly)}
<D>__{miss townsend }
<A>__{at the sound of his voice, she straightens up. she is very close to death from excitement.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{i've been away for several months, and i don't know exactly how these things are handled now. but one thing i wanted to be sure of is that you won't treat this little announcement any differently than you would any other similar announcement.}
<A>__{he hands her an envelope. she has difficulty in holding on to it.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{read it, miss townsend. and remember just the regular treatment! see you at nine o'clock, mr. bernstein!}
<A>__{kane leaves. bernstein looks after him, then at the paper. miss townsend finally manages to open the envelope. a piece of flimsy paper, with a few written lines, is her reward.}
<C>__{miss townsend}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{mr. and mrs. thomas moore norton announce the engagement of their daughter, emily monroe norton, to mr. charles foster kane.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<P>__{(starts to read it)}
<D>__{mr. and mrs. thomas moore norton announce }
<C>__{miss townsend}
<P>__{(fluttering on top of him)}
<D>__{she's she's the niece of of the president of the united states }
<C>__{bernstein}
<P>__{(nodding proudly)}
<D>__{know. come on, miss townsend from the window, maybe we can get a look.}
<A>__{he takes her by the hand and leads her off. angle toward open window. bernstein and miss townsend, backs to camera, rushing to the window.}
