<D>__{re configure the leads?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?}

<L>__{int autopsy room day}
<A>__{with waldman at his side and henry providing the tools as needed, victor instructs a freshman class in the internal workings of a dissected corpse. professor krempe observes from a distance.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{...and the medulla oblongata is the transition between the spinal cord and the two parts i've already named... cerebrum and cerebellum. any freshmen feeling queasy yet?}
<P>__{(glances around, smiles)}
<D>__{all of you, from the look of it. we'll resume your torture tomorrow.}
<A>__{he waves them dismissed. they laugh and exit, relieved. waldman squeezes victor's elbow. well done. victor stiffens at krempe's approach.}
<C>__{krempe}
<D>__{you seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{despite the lack of challenge.}
<A>__{krempe reddens, but says nothing. he gives waldman a curt nod and walks off.}
<C>__{waldman}
<D>__{victor. he was trying to be gracious.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{the strain was evident.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{come now, you must take some satisfaction. you've risen to the top of your class. a position of prominence and regard.}
<A>__{victor weighs this, glances at both of them, smiles.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{what keeps me going are my friends.}

<D>__{leave off!}
<A>__{jeweler's shop day victor is gazing with reverence at a gorgeous oval locket dangled before him by a smiling jeweler. he glances to henry for an opinion.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{your elizabeth must be quite a treasure, victor}
<P>__{(pointedly to jeweler)}
<D>__{...to justify these prices.}
<A>__{the jeweler's smile goes frosty. waldman's workshop day tight angle on the locket lying open against canvas, dangling from an easel frame. tilt down to reveal a magnificent miniature oil portrait of victor in progress, no more than three inches high within its penciled oval. waldman paints with an extraordinarily delicate touch, jeweler's glasses riding low on his nose, eyes unnaturally large behind the magnifying lenses. victor sits patiently for the portrait, suffused with daylight. henry leans in over waldman's shoulder, studying the portrait. waldman stiffens a bit, aware of his presence. he clearly hates people looking over his shoulder.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{shouldn't the nose be above the mouth?}
<A>__{waldman heaves a long suffering sigh. he abruptly jabs his brush at henry's nose, daubing it with painterior dignity upheld he resumes his careful work as victor laughs.}
