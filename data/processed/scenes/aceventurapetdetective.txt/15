<L>__{exterior surfside apartment complex day}
<A>__{ace enters the courtyard of a two story u shaped apartment complex carrying his groceries. it's a crappy joint but he calls it home. inside an open apartment on the ground floor, the landlord, mr. shickadance, sits watching tv, stuffing his face with cheese doodles. ace sneaks past the door and up the stairs.}
<L>__{exterior second floor day}
<A>__{ace is just putting the key in the door when the landlord steps up behind him. ace is startled by the dreaded 'shickadance rasp' (not unlike linda blair in the exorcist).}
<C>__{landlord}
<D>__{venturaaaaa?}
<A>__{ace straightens up, but doesn't turn around.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{yes, satan?}
<A>__{now ace turns around in mock surprise.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry, sir. you sounded like someone else.}
<C>__{landlord}
<D>__{never mind the wise cracks venturaaa. you owe me rent!}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{mr. shickadance… i told you, you're my first priority! as soon as i find the white pigeon, you're paid!!}
<C>__{landlord}
<D>__{i heard animals in there ventura! i heard 'em again this morning, scratchin' around.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{i never bring my work home with me, sir.}
<A>__{the landlord notices the bags of kibble.}
<C>__{landlord}
<D>__{oh, yeah? what's all this pet food for?}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{fiber.}
<A>__{the landlord isn't buying it.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{you wanna take a look for yourself? go head.}
<A>__{ace rattles his keys in the door. then he swings it open and turns on the light. the house is clear. ace walks in as the landlord stands there snooping and sniffing the air.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{well… are you satisfied?}
<C>__{landlord}
<P>__{(still suspicious)}
<D>__{yeah, but don't ever let me catch you with an animal in there, that's all!}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{okay then. take care now. 'bye 'bye.}
<A>__{the landlord walks away as ace closes the door.}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(quietly to himself)}
<D>__{llooser.}
<A>__{he then turns to the room and gives a distinct whistle. chaos ensues! animals jump out from every direction. lizards crawl out of drawers, birds fly through the air, all of them gravitating to ace.}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(to his flock)}
<D>__{ooshhooboobooboodoodoo!}
