<L>__{exterior schoolhouse day}
<A>__{a small breeze or a decent rain would knock it to the ground.}
<L>__{interior schoolroom continuous}
<A>__{a bookshelf with four books. a few farmers and their wives sit with large groups of filthy children. they look at franklin askance. prendergast stands proudly beside three graduates to be. tom stands in the back observing. franklin, in his wheelchair, sits uncomfortably before the gathering. he notices a father staring at his legs.}

<D>__{at groton, where i graduated from high school, our beloved headmaster encouraged his students to enter public life...}
<A>__{he looks up and catches the glazed eyes of an undernourished child which unsettles him.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{i chose to attend harvard for my undergraduate work and then columbia for my law degree.}
<A>__{he takes in their uncomprehending expressions.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{i followed my headmaster's advice and sought a career in public life. but circumstances beyond my control have made that... very difficult...}
<A>__{he stares at his tiny audience, all of whom know something about circumstances beyond their control.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{i've given many speeches in my life... i don't know why i'm having such a hard time making this one...}
<A>__{horrified and unable to speak, franklin seems temporarily lost, but the tiny audience doesn't seem to notice. they just see franklin.}
