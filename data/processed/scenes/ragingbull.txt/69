<A>__{jake lamotta, 34 years old, wearing a tux, steps in front of a large painted wall mural of the cerdan fight as he enters his club. the lounge is dominated by a large circular bar. featured entertainers perform on a raised platform in the center of the bar. the club is half filled with sports, entertainment and mob}
<B>__{types.}
<A>__{the small band plays a routine fanfare as jake steps onto the platform. he takes the mike with one hand and silences the band with the other. the applause dies out as he speaks:}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{good evening, ladies and gentlemen. it's a thrill to be standin' here talking to you wonderful people. in fact, it's a thrill to be standin'. i haven't seen so many people since my last fight at madison square garden. after that fight a reporter asked me, "jake, where do you go from here?" i said, "to a hospital."}
<A>__{about half the patrons are listening; of them, half are laughing, some a little too loud.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{i fought one hundred and six professional fights and none of them bums figured out how to fight me they kept hitting me in the head!}
<P>__{(calls to the bar)}
<D>__{will somebody at the bar linda? get me a drink. i figure if i'm gonna work to drunks i might as well be one of 'em! i like this place. it's a family type club... every night i see a lot of fathers sitting out there with their young daughters! that's nice.}
<A>__{linda hands him a drink.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{thanks, honey. she's terrific. the kinda girl you wanta take home to meet your father. especially if your old man's a degenerate! here's a toast! "to your health! you only live once. but if you play it right, once is enough." i shouldn't be drinkin' like this 'cause i'm tryin' to lose weight. i'm on this terrific diet i'm allowed to eat anything i want. as long as i don't swallow it! well, i never had much luck with my weight. in fact, i never had much luck with anything until about a few years ago, when this happened }
<A>__{he indicates the blow up behind him and waits for applause, of which there is some.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{... thanks, i'm glad to see you remember. for those of you that don't... that's me takin' the title from cerdan. you know, the tough thing about winnin' the title... the next thing you gotta do is have a rematch... just to show it wasn't no fluke. so what happens? marcel cerdan, a really great champ, after i beat him... he gets himself killed in that airplane crash... a pretty rotten break for him. that's why i don't like to fly. people say to me, "look, jake, when your time is up, your time is up." and i say, "yeah, but suppose i'm on the plane and the pilot's time is up?" as good as cerdan was, i could've taken him again. but i never got the chance to prove it wasn't no fluke. he got killed but he got to be what they call a legend. i don't know what's worse bein' a fluke or bein' a legend. that's the kinda luck i got. that's why i quit the ring and moved down here from new york. my wife said, "you gotta get outa this town, jake." come to think of it... the boxing commission said the same thing! but i don't miss new york. give me miami any day.}
<A>__{the audience applauds.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{miami's a great place. i get along with everybody in this town... even the police force... they got the best cops here money can buy! only kiddin'. by the way... me and my wife vickie's gettin' ready to celibrate our eleventh wedding anniversary.}
<A>__{more applause.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{we get along real great. we fight a little but i never really belted her on purpose. once in a while i'm standin' there doin' little shadow boxin' and she happens to walk right into the shadow... i can't help that. she says, "whataya hittin' me for?" i says, "it's nothin'. it's only a love tap." she says, "it's a good thing you're not crazy about me!" i am crazy about her. i heard her talkin' to a friend on the phone and she was sayin', "after eleven years, i'm still in love with the same guy." if i ever find out who the bum is, i will kill him! women. you can't live with 'em, you can't live without 'em.}
<A>__{then, suddenly, falling into character... he quotes lago's speech in othello.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{"'oh, beware, my lord, of jealousy. it is the green eyed monster, which doth mock the meat it feeds on. that cuckold lives in bliss who, certain of his fate, loves not his woronger; but o, what damned minutes tells he o'er who dotes, yet doubts suspects, yet fondly loves!" that's from somethin' called "othello" }
<A>__{or, alternate speech:}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{is whispering nothing? is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses? kissing with inside lip? stopping the career of laughter with a sign? a note infallible of breaking honesty horsing foot on foot? skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift? hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only, that would unseen be wicked? is this nothing? why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing; the covering sky is nothing; bohemia nothing; my wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings, if this be nothing." that's from something called "the winter's tale" shakespeare! you all remember shakespeare. he wrote all them famous plays one after the other, then he went into a big slump and he ain't done anything good in years. that speech is about jealousy jealousy's a bad thing. jealousy bothers a lot of guys... take me... i almost killed my brother... i love him... he's my family... i mean, there's nothin' he wouldn't do for me. and that's the way we been goin' thru life doin' nothin' for each other! anytime he got in trouble when we was kids, i got him out of it. you know, he used to steal little things when we was growin' up. but he was particular... only stole things that begin with an 'a' a watch, a car, a suit, a ring... but i was wrong... i shoulda never hit my brother. afterwards, i was sorry. now every time i need somethin' i gotta go shoppin' for it! a psychiatrist once told me, "when you hit your brother you're really hittin' your mother, but you can't admit it to yourself." he's really crazy. i woulda never hit my mother. i mean, only in self defense!}
