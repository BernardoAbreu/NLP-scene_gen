<A>__{a beautiful, sunny day. the clearing is full. everyone looks bright and hopeful. dressed in bright, summer clothes... a robust baby suggs is on her rock giving her best call, as camera pans the crowd of faces eager to believe ....}
<C>__{baby suggs}
<D>__{..the only grace we can have, is the grace we can imagine. if you cannot see it, you will not have it...here, in this place, we are flesh. flesh that weeps, laughs, dances on bare feet in the grass. love it. love it hard. yonder they do not love your flesh. they despise it. they flay it. o, my people, they do not love your hands. those they only use, tie, bind, chop off and leave empty, love your hands. love them. raise them up and kiss them. touch others with them, put them together, stroke them on your face 'cause they don't love that either. you got to love it. you. yonder out there, they ain't in love with your moth. they will see it broken and break it again. what you say out of it, they will not heed. what you scream from it they do not hear. no, they don't love your mother. you got to love it. and the feet that need to rest and to dance. the backs that needs support. the shoulders that need arms, strong arms i'm telling you! o my people, out yonder they don't love your neck unnoosed and straight. so love your neck; put a hand on it, grace it, stroke it and hold it up. love all your inside parts, love 'em..and the beating heart, love that too. more than eyes or feet. more than lungs that have yet to draw free air, love your heart. for this is the prize.}

<B>__{dance and twirl up on her rock.}
<A>__{and the crowd gives her music, singing in four part harmony. camera pans the crowd of beautiful faces singing together. among the crowd, we see familiar faces... we see the women who sang at 124... we stamp paid, ella, john, and lady jones... and we see sethe, surrounded by all her children.}
