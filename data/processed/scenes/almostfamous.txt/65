<L>__{interior bus night}
<A>__{several hours later on this ride. outside, night and desert. inside, a few cigarettes, a joint of two glow in the darkness of the bus. the end of the led zeppelin classic "whole lotta love" plays from the bus stereo, full blast. everybody is free and anonymous in the dark. they sing at full volume. william looks out the window in wonder.}

<A>__{john bonham's drums thunder through the bus, everybody still singing as they dip down into the city ahead, phoenix. william watches the living documentary around him. he writes furiously in the green notebook, scribbling in the dark, trying to steady his writing on the bumpy bus. behind him, someone is beating along to the song on his seat. he never want to leave this world.}
