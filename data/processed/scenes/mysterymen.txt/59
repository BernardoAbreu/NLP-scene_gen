<D>__{i admire you.}
<C>__{furious}

<C>__{monica}
<D>__{being a superhero, wanting to save the world. it's so... unselfish.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{it is?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{most people just want to make money or be famous or something. but you risk everything, just to help people.}
<C>__{furious}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{i wouldn't mind being famous.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{who wouldn't?}
<A>__{in the shadows behind them... casanova follows, stalking them, as silent as a vampire.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why i guess i'm still a waitress.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{nothing wrong with being a waitress.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{what's your real name?}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{roy.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{have you always lived here?}
<A>__{he nods.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{me too... i love this stupid old town. it's noisy. it's smelly. it's falling apart.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{it's home.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{casanova's pov monica, smiling, looking lovely. close 0n casanova; he wants her... back on furious and monica }
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i've thought of leaving, going to chicago or new york, but...}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{what have they got that we ain't got?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{champion's going to bounce back, and i want to be here when it does.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{me, too.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{you don't seem very angry right now.}
<A>__{he shrugs. and they kiss, very tenderly.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{you know what? underneath all that anger i think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{i just want to be a superhero.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{that's what i mean... 'night, roy.}
<A>__{she turns and climbs the stairs of an old apartmnt building and goes inside, as furious watches, feeling emotions hees not used to. he really likes her. he starts walking back down the street, past a man sitting on the stoop. the man looks up. it's casanova frankenstein.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{going my way?}
<A>__{furious is caught completely by surprise he takes a stand, ready to fight.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{take it easy take it easy. i just want to have a little chat... that was quite a number you did on my car. you've got a lot of violence in you... and i like that in a guy.}
<A>__{furious, silent.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{you know what the difference is between good and evil, roy?}
<A>__{furious reacts to the fact that casanova knows his real name.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{evil is more fun. when you want something, you just take it, and if somebody gets in your way, you kill them... you seem like a very frustrated guy, roy. unhappy. unfulfilled. what is it that you've always wanted, always desired? because whatever it is, i can give it to you... fame?}
<P>__{(snaps his fingers)}
<D>__{easy. fortune? even easier. women?}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{the easiest of all.}
<A>__{close on furious as, out of the corner of his eye, he catches movement in the alley across the street... he knows what it is.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{i will let you in on a little secret, roy. in two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. it's the perfect time to switch teams... so what do you say?}
<C>__{furious}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{you're nuts.}
<C>__{casanova}
<P>__{(flairs)}
<D>__{they always call the great ones nuts.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{and the nuts always call themselves great.}
<C>__{casanova}
<P>__{(his psychosis showing)}
<D>__{are you with me... or against me?}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{against.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{too bad. plug him!}
<A>__{gunfire rings out from the alley as the disco bays step out, their pistols blazing. but furious has anticipated them. he leaps right at casanova, pins his arms in a bear hug and holds him in the line of fire.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{the disco bqys stop firing... furious drags casanova back into an empty lot, using him as a shield.}
<C>__{furious}
<P>__{(to casanova)}
<D>__{thanks for reminding me which team i'm on.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{you're dead.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{so are you!}
<A>__{furious releases casanova, then runs for it and leaps over the wooden wall at the end of the lot... as the disco boys open fire again, and their bullets punch holes through the wall... furious runs down a back street and escapes into the night.}
