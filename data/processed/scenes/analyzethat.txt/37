<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior u.s. attorney's office day}
<A>__{ben meets with richard chapin, the u.s. attorney for the southern district of new york.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{based on his symptoms and the test results, i'd say brief psychotic disorder if it persists, possibly schizophreniform disorder. and dr. cutler agrees with my diagnosis.}
<C>__{chapin}
<D>__{so he's crazy?}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{dr. cutler? no, he's annoying, but }
<C>__{chapin}
<A>__{vitti.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{not crazy. at least not permanently. in certain people, continuous exposure to an extremely stressful situation soldiers in combat, for instance, disaster victims, a hostage situation, or being locked up in a maximum security prison with someone trying to kill you it can produce a temporary psychotic state.}
<C>__{chapin}
<A>__{how temporary?}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{a day, a week, up to a month if the precipitating stressors are removed.}
<C>__{chapin}
<P>__{(musing)}
<A>__{which means he's not going to get any better while he's still in the can.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{he could get worse. he could deteriorate to the point where he'd be permanently schizophrenic.}
<C>__{chapin}
<A>__{then i'd say he's got a real problem, because he goes before the parole board in four weeks.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{you think they'll let him out?}
<C>__{chapin}
<A>__{oh, yeah, i'm sure they'll want to release a major mafia figure who's now totally deranged on top of it.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<A>__{well, couldn't you release him to a halfway house or some place where he could get some decent treatment? based on my earlier work with him, i don't think he's dangerous, and i think he was making a real effort to reform himself.}
<C>__{chapin}
<A>__{you do, huh?}
<P>__{(thinks for a long moment)}
<A>__{okay. then i will tell you what. i'm gonna release him into your custody.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{mine? me? no, this is a bad time for me. my father just died and i've got this bulging disc in my neck and we're redecorating, which is a total nightmare. i can't }
<C>__{chapin}
<A>__{you want to see him killed in prison?}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{no, of course not.}
<C>__{chapin}
<A>__{or sent to a facility for the criminally insane.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{no }
<C>__{chapin}
<A>__{then he's all yours. i'm going to talk to the bureau of prisons and get you certified as a temporary federal institution.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(stricken)}
<A>__{what? i can't be an institution.}
<C>__{chapin}
<P>__{(firm)}
<A>__{you've got thirty days to get him in shape for his parole hearing. that means sane, sober and gainfully employed. but let me warn you, doctor. if he fucks up in any way if he flees, or if i find out that this whole thing was just a setup so he could get back on the street and return to a life of crime i will hold you totally responsible, and i will see that you are stripped of your license and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. are we clear?}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(gulp)}
<A>__{yes. we're clear.}
<C>__{chapin}
<D>__{you still want him?}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(long beat to decide)}
<D>__{yes.}
