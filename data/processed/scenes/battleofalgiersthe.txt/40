<L>__{40 rue philippe. outside. day. 8:35 a.m.}
<A>__{an algerian woman walks along the sidewalk. she is elderly, fat, and is wearing a traditional costume with her face veiled. she walks slowly toward a bar, which has its tables outside, and already some customers. near the bar, leaning against a wall, there is an algerian who now begins to move and goes to meet the old woman. they greet one another with much warmth, like a mother and son who haven't seen each other for a long time. they embrace, and the man searches at her breast among the folds of her veil. he finds a revolver which is hung by a cord, and grabs it. they are at ten or twelve feet distance from the bar. at a table, there is a french soldier having coffee with cream, croissant, and an open newspaper. the algerian continues to embrace the old woman, and aims from above her shoulders. only one shot; the newspaper rips, the soldier tries to get up again, his face full of blood. then he collapses on the table. the algerian has hidden the revolver in the woman's veil. the two separate from their embrace. they seem terrified and surprised, and move away from each other in different directions while the people are rushing about and shouting.}
