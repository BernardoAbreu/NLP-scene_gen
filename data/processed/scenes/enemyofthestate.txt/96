<D>__{if you find something, chalk the baltimore sheraton mailbox and go to temperanceville. it's south of salisbury.}
<P>__{(giving dean his pistol)}
<D>__{and take this.}
<A>__{and with that, he's gone. dean eyes the gun. he walks to the ledge, looking at the city. dean's pov: several vehicles quietly pull up to the building. men storm out an move inside. dean quickly backs away.}
