<L>__{interior kate's mother's home living room day}
<A>__{kate and charlie sit down. the place is a mess. magazines and junkmail everywhere. too much furniture thrown together in a chaotic manner. the walls are covered with framed heavy metal band posters and there are ashtrays everywhere, filled to the brim with cigarette butts.}
<C>__{rochelle }
<D>__{...you wouldn't believe how much the neighborhood's changed! after mr. baker passed away and the kids put mrs. baker in a home, the people that moved in, oof!}
<A>__{rochelle walks in holding a tray with three gin and tonics.}
<C>__{rochelle }
<D>__{it's like they don't even understand the concept of birth control in their country!}
<A>__{rochelle hands charlie a glass and then goes to kate and puts a drink on the table in front of her.}
<C>__{rochelle }
<P>__{(confides)}
<D>__{if you ask me, i think it's a meth house.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{they've always got those little five year old twins "playing" in the yard, but i'm pretty sure they're the lookouts.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{that's pretty wild, mom.}
<C>__{rochelle}
<D>__{right?}
<P>__{(notices that kate hasn't touched her drink)}
<D>__{what's wrong, honey? think i forgot how to mix `em?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i told you i just wanted water.}
<C>__{rochelle}
<D>__{oh, please! where i'm from, "no" means "yes."}
<P>__{(to charlie)}
<D>__{am i right or am i right?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(forcing it)}
<D>__{huh huh...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{that's actually why i wanted to come up, mom.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i stopped drinking.}
<A>__{rochelle laughs then realizes kate and charlie aren't joking.}
<C>__{rochelle}
<P>__{(quickly serious)}
<D>__{are you telling me i'm going to be a grandma?}
<A>__{rochelle tears up with joy.}
<C>__{rochelle }
<D>__{oh that's so exciting! i'm gonna be a grandma!}
<P>__{(to charlie)}
<D>__{and you know that "no drinking when you're pregnant" thing is just a myth. i drank plenty when i was pregnant with kate and look how she turned out!}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i'm not pregnant, mom.}
<C>__{rochelle}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i just needed a break. i'm sober for the first time in years.}
<C>__{rochelle}
<D>__{well...}
<P>__{(dismissive)}
<D>__{...we'll see how long that lasts.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{it's been a while, actually.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(chimes in)}
<D>__{90 days.}
<C>__{rochelle}
<P>__{(to kate)}
<D>__{you've sure picked the right partner }
<P>__{(gestures to charlie)}
<D>__{ for this little mission.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{hey i'm not drinking either...today.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(to charlie; slightly annoyed)}
<D>__{drink if you want to, charlie.}
<P>__{(to rochelle)}
<D>__{charlie didn't stop drinking. i'm doing it by myself.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and...i started going to 12 step meetings.}
<A>__{rochelle looks slightly disgusted.}
<C>__{rochelle}
<D>__{ah...yes. assholes anonymous.}
<P>__{(to charlie)}
<D>__{katie's father went to those meetings a few years after we got married. dried up. left me. you can see how well that worked out for me...}
<P>__{(rochelle gestures to her living room)}
<D>__{...i raised his daughter in this palace while he's somewhere in florida with his shiny new wife and kids.}

<D>__{bastard.}
<P>__{(long beat; to charlie)}
<D>__{you better be careful they change.}
<A>__{kate and charlie exchange a glance.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i thought you'd be happy for me, mom.}
<C>__{rochelle}
<D>__{oh...i'm sorry i'm not being a good hostess, am i?}
<A>__{rochelle gets up, takes the drink away from kate, and chugs it.}
<C>__{rochelle }
<D>__{i will microwave you your favorite.}
<B>__{a few moments later}
<A>__{charlie, kate, and rochelle watch a reality tv show while eating...}
<B>__{...mcdonalds cheeseburgers.}
<A>__{rochelle rests her head on kate's shoulder.}
<C>__{rochelle }
