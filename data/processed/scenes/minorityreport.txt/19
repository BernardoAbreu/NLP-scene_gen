<L>__{interiora boarding house the sprawl day}
<A>__{anderson pushes down a tight hallway thick with police and enters a disheveled room. the fifties interior is drab: a formica table, bad curtains, a frayed lazy boy positioned in front of a tv. ed witwer is already on the scene. he stands a few feet from the body of a man, gunshot wound to the head, a handgun on the floor nearby.}
<C>__{witwer}
<P>__{(to anderson)}
<D>__{looks like the old days.}
<A>__{anderson nods to his former partner. anderson leans over the body.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{that would be bad news for an infallible system.}
<A>__{witwer is suddenly bored.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{we know it can't be a murder the precogs would've seen it. why do you insist on coming to these things?}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{keeps the system honest. and besides, i like to pretend i'm a cop.}
<A>__{anderson turns to an officer.}
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{who's got the coroner?}
<A>__{another officer steps forward with a large blue case.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{right here, sir.}
<A>__{the officer places the case beside the corpse, and opens the latches. inside the case is a large metallic apparatus: the "coroner." it comes to auto life, and begins to unfold itself it rises crab like, and steps out of its case. except for his mouth, the doctor doesn't move. his projected image stands beside the body, his arms folded behind his back. he is the interface, the way the humans communicate with the crab apparatus.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{hi doc.}
<C>__{holographic doctor}
<D>__{hello, director anderson.}
<A>__{the coroner crab begins to walk the body, which is face down on the floor. it moves slowly, hesitating as it crawls the body's back to insert various razor thin probes and core samplers through the shirt and into the spinal cord.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{this a homicide, doc?}
<C>__{holographic doctor}
<D>__{i'm presently analyzing neurohormones, assistant director witwer. i have not concluded my examination.}
<A>__{the crab engulfs the back of the head, probes the wound.}
<C>__{holographic doctor }
<D>__{i'm detecting carbonization of skull fragments around the entry wound.}
<A>__{witwer whispers to anderson.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{bingo. the guy put the gun to his own head.}
<C>__{holographic doctor}
<D>__{i have not determined that yet, assistant director.}
<A>__{witwer grins.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{you have good ears for a ghost, doc.}
<A>__{the coroner crab steps away from the body.}
<C>__{holographic doctor}
<D>__{please rotate the corpse to the lateral supine position.}
<A>__{two officers turn the body face up. the crab inches close to probe the face. disconcertingly, it lifts the eyelids, and examines the interior of the mouth, so that for a moment the manipulation makes the corpse seem alive. then the crab moves down the trunk and the legs at last, it comes to a standstill. the holographic doctor closes his eyes as if in thought.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{can you imagine if this was a homicide? who even knows how to hunt down a killer any more?}
<A>__{anderson gives him a hard look.}
<D>__{anderson i know how, dammit. you know how.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{easy, partner.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but you know what i'm saying. the state legislatures are pushing to stop funding for training homicide detectives ...}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{god bless the precogs.}
<A>__{the doctor opens his eyes.}
<C>__{holographic doctor}
<D>__{this event is a negative homicide. a mortal wound was generated by a .22 calibre bullet self delivered to the parietal 'portion of the skull on june 10th, 2040, at 11:57 pm,}
<C>__{holographic doctor }
<D>__{eastern standard time. this event is a positive suicide.}
<A>__{the holographic doctor begins to shimmer, then disappears back into the coroner crab. the crab crawls back into its case, folds its probes and legs tight to its metal body, and shuts down. witwer turns to anderson.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{it's time to stop coming to these, partner.}
<A>__{anderson watches as the med techs lift the body onto a stretcher.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{yeah. you're right.}
