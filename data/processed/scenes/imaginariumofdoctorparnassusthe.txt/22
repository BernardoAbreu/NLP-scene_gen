<L>__{int monastery dining hall night}
<A>__{entering via a window and looking down into the monastery dining hall, we see dozens of monks sitting at a long refectory table. they are eating their supper and listening to a young dr. parnassus who is sitting on a dais at the far end of the hall, his eyes closed, in a trance, telling a story. a log fire burns in a big fireplace.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{... having captured the wind and tamed the storm ... the chief steward, laying down to take his rest, had a disturbing dream... he dreamt that a hooded rider was approaching across the snow swept plain.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus }
<D>__{a rider who would challenge the very foundations of the world...}
<A>__{the door to the refectory swings open with a crash. the monks look up. standing on the thresh hold is the hooded figure, covered with snow. he throws off his hood. it's mr nick.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus }
<D>__{... the steward woke and remembered his dream. what manner of man had he dreamt of, and what did it signify?}
