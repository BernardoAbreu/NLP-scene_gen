<A>__{water cascades in through the open windows. they're thrown around as the humvee rides the rapids. wham. the passenger door caves in as the humvee rams into a large rock then is swept further downstream. through the foam and spray, charlie looks over to bridger. he's dead. the torrent roars. only their chests and heads are above water. and that's not all. there's a waterfall ahead.}
<L>__{exterior waterfall}
