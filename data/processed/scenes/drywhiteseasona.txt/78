<L>__{exterior funeral parlor day}
<A>__{outside the "sunlight," the children's laughter and stanley, hands in pockets, waiting for ben by the car. the same two little girls approach stanley who gives them some coins they run off happily. ben is coming outside blinking in the glaring sunlight. stanley glares at ben, who is pale, shaken and silent. they get into the car in silence.}

<P>__{(exposed)}
<D>__{i... i cannot think. i'm confused.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{you either believe what you saw or maybe you still prefer the government version.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{for christ sake, just get off my back, stanley.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{okay. it was a simple question.}
