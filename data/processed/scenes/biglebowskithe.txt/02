<A>__{long shot of the glowing ralph's. there are only two or three cars parked in the huge lot.}
<D>__{voice over wal, i lost m'train of thought here. but aw hell, i done innerduced him enough.}
<A>__{the dude is a small figure walking across the vast lot. next to him walks a mexican carry out boy in a red apron and cap carrying a small brown bag holding the quart of milk. the two men's footsteps echo in the still of the night. after a beat of walking the dude offhandedly points.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{it's the lebaron.}
<A>__{dude's house the dude is going up the walkway of a small venice bungalow court. he holds the paper sack in one hand and a small leatherette satchel in the other. he awkwardly hugs the grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door.}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{the dude enters and flicks on a light. his head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit. we track with him as he is rushed through the living room, his arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body. going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a hole. the dude is propelled across the bedroom and on into a small bathroom, the satchel once again taking away a piece of doorframe. his head is plunged into the toilet. the paper bag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet rim and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the floor. the dude blows bubbles.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{we want that money, lebowski. bunny said you were good for it.}
<A>__{hands haul the dude out of the toilet. the dude blubbers and gasps for air.}

<C>__{voice}
<D>__{don't fuck with us. if your wife owes money to jackie treehorn, that means you owe money to jackie treehorn.}
<A>__{the inquisitor hauls the dude's head out one last time and flops him over so that he sits on the floor, back against the toilet. the dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand. looming over him is a strapping blond man. beyond in the living room a young chinese man unzips his fly and walks over to a rug.}
<C>__{chinese man}
<D>__{ever thus to deadbeats, lebowski.}
<A>__{he starts peeing on the rug. the dude's hand comes out of the toilet bowl with his sunglasses.}

<C>__{dude}
<D>__{you see a wedding ring? does this place look like i'm fucking married? all my plants are dead!}
<A>__{the blond man stoops to unzip the satchel. he pulls out a bowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious native.}
<C>__{blond man}
<D>__{the fuck is this?}
<A>__{the dude pats at his pockets, takes out a joint and lights it.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{obviously you're not a golfer.}
<A>__{the blond man drops the ball which pulverizes more tile.}
<C>__{blond man}
