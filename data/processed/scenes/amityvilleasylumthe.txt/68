<A>__{she looks around for the bin, finally locating it by the side of the desk. lisa pulls the full bag out and ties it up before replacing it with a new bag. with her task complete, lisa's curiosity gets the better of her. she looks around the office. there is a shelf full of psychology books and a filing cabinet. lisa touches the top drawer of the filing cabinet and it opens. lisa looks at all of the names on the files and finds one marked 'patient x'. she reaches for it and suddenly a hand grabs her shoulder! a startled lisa turns around. an orderly in his thirties is stood in front of her. he is thin but muscular, with slicked back hair. this is pemberton.}

<D>__{well new girl, it's hospital policy to report this kind of thing.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{but i've only just got this job and i really need it.}
<A>__{pemberton looks her up and down.}
<C>__{pemberton}
<D>__{perhaps we can come to some arrangement.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{pemberton}
<D>__{well, i'd be doing you a big favour if i kept this to myself. so perhaps you can do me a favour.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{what kind of favour?}
<C>__{pemberton}
<D>__{a blow job.}
<A>__{lisa's face contorts with disgust.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{you're disgusting!}

<D>__{oh come on, i bet you'd love it.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{look, you better get out of my way or i'm going to report you for sexual harassment.}
<C>__{pemberton}
<D>__{you've been working here for five minutes. you really think doctor mixter is gonna believe a fucking cleaner over a medical professional?}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{pemberton!}
<A>__{pemberton spins around. delaney is stood in the door way.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{leave her alone.}
<A>__{pemberton laughs.}
<C>__{pemberton}
<D>__{she ain't no prisoner here! i was just talking, what's the problem?}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{no problem. lisa, come with me, we've got a job up on ward b.}
<A>__{a grateful lisa brushes past pemberton and exits the room. delaney glares at pemberton for a moment before leaving the room. pemberton smirks.}
