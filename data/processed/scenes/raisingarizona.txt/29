<D>__{...what's he need, his dip tet?}
<C>__{hi}
<D>__{i'm awful sorry boys, but when ed gets mad, you know, when she gets an idea...}

<D>__{well there ain't a thing to apologize for, h.i...}
<A>__{he looks at evelle.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{...it seems pretty clear what the situation is here.}
<C>__{evelle}

<C>__{gale}
<D>__{...ain't exactly workin' out.}
<C>__{hi}
<D>__{well now ed's generally a real sweetheart, i }
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{and as per usual, i wouldn't be surprised if the source of the marital friction was financial.}
<C>__{hi}
<D>__{well, matter of fact, i did lose my job today }
<C>__{evelle}
<D>__{come on hi. you're young, you got your health what do you want with a job?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{but look, i'd rather light a candle than curse your darkness. as you know, evelle'n i never go anywhere without a reason... and here we are in your little domicile. we come to invite you in on a score.}
<C>__{evelle}
<D>__{a bank, hi.}
<A>__{hi is shaking his head.}
<C>__{hi}
<D>__{aw boys, i don't }
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{i know you're partial to convenience stores but, h.i., the sun don't rise and set on the corner grocery.}
<C>__{evelle}
<D>__{it's like doc schwartz says: you gotta have a little ambition. why we just heard on the news how somebody snatched off one of the arizona babies. now there's someone thinkin' big.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{and here you are sittin' around on your butt playin' house with a don't get me wrong, h.i., with a fine woman but a woman who needs the button down type.}
<C>__{hi}
<D>__{well now that ain't really any of your }
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{just lookahere...}
<A>__{he is handing hi a folded up picture.}
<C>__{evelle}
<D>__{picture of el dorado, hi.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{though the locals call it the farmers and mechanics bank of lagrange. looks like a hayseed bank and, tell you the truth, it is a hayseed bank. except the last friday of every financial quarter there's more cash in that bank than flies at a barbecue.}
<C>__{evelle}
<D>__{and guess what day it is tomorrow?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{ya see, h.i., it's when the hayseeds come in to cash their farm subsidy checks.}
<C>__{evelle}
<D>__{a one information.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{got it in the joint from a guy named lawrence spivey, one of dick nixon's undersecretaries of agriculture.}
<C>__{evelle}
<D>__{he's in for solicitin' sex from a state trooper.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{ordinarily we don't associate with that class of person, but...}
<A>__{gale chuckles.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{...he was tryin' to make brownie points with some of the boys.}
<C>__{hi}
<D>__{boys, i can't }
<C>__{evielle}
<D>__{we need someone handy with a scatter gun to cover the hayseeds while we get the cash.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{y'understand, h.i., if this works out it's just the beginning of a spree across the entire southwest proper. we keep goin' 'till we can retire or we get caught.}
<C>__{evelle}
<D>__{either way we're fixed for life.}
<A>__{hi is still shaking his head.}
<C>__{hi}
<D>__{boys, it's a kind offer, but you're suggesting i just up'n leave ed. now that'd be pretty damn cowardly, wouldn't it.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{would it? think about it, h.i. seems to me, stayin' here, y'ain't doin' her any good. and y'ain't bein' true to your own nature.}
<A>__{the camera has floated in to a close shot of hi, staring glumly at gale.}
<B>__{tracking on motorcycle night}
<A>__{following it, very close, we see only its rear wheel and fender and twin exhaust pipes, one on either side. flame is boiling in each exhaust pipe as the hog roars.}
<B>__{higher tracking shot}
<A>__{from behind the biker's head as he rides through the night. with the sharp whipcrack effect he suddenly looks left, searching. with a second whipcrack effect he suddenly looks right, still searching. he banks into a turn.}
