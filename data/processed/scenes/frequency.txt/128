<L>__{interior 23rd precinct men's room afternoon}
<A>__{john and satch stand at the urinals.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{okay, lemme walk you through it.}
<C>__{satch}
<D>__{mind if i shake it off first...so's i can concentrate better.}
<A>__{john waits for satch to finish. then, as they head out into the hallway...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{three guys show up in both the yearbook and diary.}
<L>__{interior detective squad interrogation room continuous}
<A>__{the first guy passed away ten years ago. the second one died in vietnam. the room has a holding pen opposite the door. a table is pushed up against the door wall and a more elaborate layout of the murder victims, paperwork, and calendar timeline graphs sit on the table and are pinned on a cork board. mary finelli's uniform is there. john shows satch a photo in mary finelli's year book.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{the third one is daryl adams.}
<A>__{satch looks, nods, and steps back. waits for more. john hands him daryl adams' rap sheet.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{i ran him through bci...got a hit. busted for sexual assault: march 22, 1970. eight days after the last nightingale murder.}
<C>__{satch}
<D>__{so you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street. then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{not the first time that's been true. i'm telling you, i got a feeling about this guy. this is the guy, satch.}
<C>__{satch}
<D>__{uh, huh.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{satch}
<D>__{i'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.}
