<A>__{frances emerges from the stage door to a throng of autograph seekers. she smiles tiredly, but good naturedly complies. a little ways back stands a boyish young man holding a single red carnation. when the autograph seekers are satisfied and all but a few have trailed away, the young man steps forward.}
