<L>__{interior wally's car night}
<A>__{the radio is playing. candy is lying down, her knees drawn up, in the backseat; she appears to be asleep, oblivious to homer and wally's conversation.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{actually, the army has given me leave twice. first when my father died, and now i'm on leave to help my mother i'm just trying to get her ready for the harvest. she's no farmer. apples were my dad's business. and with the war on, she's short on pickers.}
<A>__{candy's eyes are open but her voice is groggy.}
<C>__{candy}
<P>__{(to homer)}
<D>__{wally thinks apples are boring.}
<C>__{wally}
<P>__{(to homer)}
<D>__{i never said they were boring.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{you said, "apples aren't exactly flying."}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{well, they aren't.}
<A>__{homer looks back at candy. her eyes close.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{i think i'd probably like the apple business.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{you're a little overqualified, aren't you?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{no, i'm not. i need a job.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{the only jobs are picking jobs. picking apples is truly boring.}
<A>__{candy's eyes snap open and she sits up a little.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{there! you said it was boring.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{well, picking them is! it's about as exciting as... walking!}
<A>__{candy seems irritated with wally. homer tries to engage her.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{is your family in the apple business, too?}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{no, but i work there i like it. my dad's a lobsterman.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{i've never seen a lobster.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{i've never seen the ocean, either.}
<C>__{wally}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{you've never seen the ocean?}
<A>__{homer shakes his head, smiles.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{that's not funny... that's serious.}
