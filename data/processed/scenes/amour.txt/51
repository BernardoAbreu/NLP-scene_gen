<L>__{interior living room day}
<A>__{georges and the second nurse.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{... as you wish, sir. i don't know what you were expecting. i gave up another job to come and work here. you should have thought it over before deciding whether you wanted a second nurse or not.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{but i've only just found out how incompetent you are.}
<C>__{nurse}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{i don't want to discuss it with you. anyway, you wouldn't understand.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{no one has ever complained.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{good for you. (to get rid of her)}
<D>__{how much do i owe you?}
<C>__{nurse}
<P>__{(after a brief calculation)}
<D>__{seven hundred and eighty euros.}
<A>__{georges takes his wallet from his jacket hanging on the armchair and takes out eight one hundred euro bills. the nurse is hopping mad.}
<C>__{nurse }
<D>__{i've never had anything like this happen to me before. who do you think you are?! i've been doing this job for ten years. i don't need you to teach me how to do it.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{do you have twenty euros?}
<A>__{the nurse takes out her purse angrily, looks inside.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{then take the eight hundred euros. you can go now.}
<A>__{the nurse pockets the money.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{you're a nasty old man. i feel sorry for you.}
<A>__{georges has put back his wallet, turns to her again and looks at her.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{i hope from the bottom of my heart that one day someone treats you the way you treat your patients, and that you too will have no way of defending yourself. now get out.}
<A>__{she looks at him, at first doesn't know what to answer, then:}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{go fuck yourself, you old fart!}
<A>__{she leaves, slamming the door behind her. a few seconds later, we hear the front door of the apartment fall shut. georges sits down in his armchair, looks straight ahead. then he lights a cigarette, his hands shake, he smokes.}
