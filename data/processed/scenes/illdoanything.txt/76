<D>__{no sitter!!! thanks. we're leaving now.}
<L>__{interior make up room day}
<A>__{matt is in the final process of being made up, going over his lines. cathy enters.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{jeannie's fine. there's a whole bunch of kids in the building. she's fascinated. and they're all ready for you.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{how many men are they testing today?}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{you're the only one.}
<A>__{matt is surprised... but he is a pro and so immediately makes use of this sudden blip in status.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{then tell them i need a little more time. make up person no, it's okay, we're done.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i mean for me. i want to focus a little.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{sure.}
<P>__{(she hugs matt)}
<D>__{good luck, matt.}
<P>__{(whispered advice)}
<D>__{the thing they're looking for most is sexy.}
<A>__{and then they're gone. with that bit of advice, matt is totally fucked up. a beat after cathy leaves:}
<C>__{hair person}
<D>__{you know who she was involved with for a minute or so? make up person who?}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{on their look...}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{you guys have to leave. this is important and i need to be alone right now...}
<A>__{they exit... matt thumbs through the script... does a relaxation exercise... takes a breath and thinks... a beat and he is reasonably confident... he walks one half circle of the room making sure he's fully pumped, then exits.}
