<L>__{interior hallway day}
<A>__{geoff joins the stampede of kids as the bell releases them for the day. almost immediately, clyde and his cronies, stevie and brad, fall in step behind him. drew hangs slightly off to the side, not really wanting to be a part of the intimidation.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{what's the hurry, junior? where you off to?}
<A>__{clyde quickens his pace, pulling ahead of geoff and stopping in front of him. stevie and brad move in on either side. surrounded by peers, it's apparent how small geoff is for his age. on the wall next to them is a bulletin board display. clyde glances at it. geoff follows his gaze.}
<B>__{display}
<A>__{it's one of those corny school affairs with construction paper letters spelling out: "we remember renee hallow." beneath that are pictures of renee clipped from various magazines. cloyingly tasteless.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(feigning remorse)}
<D>__{too bad about your mom. papers said it was pretty gross, getting fried like that. guess you saw it, huh?}
<A>__{geoff nods. clyde raises his eyebrows, pulling geoff's jacket open.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{so, what are you hiding there?}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{when you bring a friend to school you're supposed to introduce him.}
<A>__{geoff's arm tightens protectively around tiger.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{her name's tiger.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{tiger? don't you think that's kind of a pussy name?}
<P>__{(reaching out)}
<D>__{can i hold her? i promise i will be real careful.}
<A>__{clyde has a convincing way about him. geoff reluctantly hands the kitten over. clyde is so gentle with the creature that one would never question his sincerity. geoff is just beginning to feel at ease when something changes in clyde's tone, something sinister.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{hey, geoff. you ever seen a kitten run?}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{i've seen her run around the house.}
<A>__{clyde's eyes narrow. he takes a couple of steps back. geoff's heart starts to sink.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{no, i mean really run...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{like this!}
<A>__{clyde backsteps and bolts off down the hallway with tiger. brad and stevie fall in behind him, laughing. drew shrugs apologetically. he's torn, but he tears off after them nonetheless.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{shit...}
<A>__{geoff runs off in pursuit of them.}
