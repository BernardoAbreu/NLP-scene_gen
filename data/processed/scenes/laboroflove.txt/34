<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior house night}
<A>__{a wine chiller sits proudly on the coffee table. the sounds of light conversation float through the room. about ten friends and family have gathered. maurice sits on the sofa nearest the window. he's listening to the drone of ted price. ellen is not present.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{... so she says the "l" word, after two dates, the "l" word! she says 'don't you believe in true love? love that can conquer all?' i say, 'whoa, hold on. just so we're clear on things, i think love these days is shit. it don't mean a thing and it don't stand for nothing. shit.'... you know what she says, 'fine, but how do you feel about kids?'}
<A>__{everyone near the sofa laughs. a car light dances on the curtains... maurice quickly pulls the curtain aside and watches as the car pulls past the house and around the corner. maurice turns back from the window hiding his concern and without missing a beat...}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{it's nice to see you don't have any scars from your divorce.}
<A>__{this brings on another round of laughter.}
<B>__{the telephone rings.}
<A>__{maurice rises from his seat but is waved off by adelle matlin who picks up the phone right away. adelle is maurice's niece, early thirties, very attractive and always smiling except at this moment. ted begins another one of his stories the words are incoherent as maurice watches adelle carefully... adelle turns her back to the room as she talks and then disappears into the kitchen stretching the phone cord around the doorway... something is definitely wrong. maurice steadies his gaze at the door of the kitchen... eternal seconds pass before adelle appears again. she looks different ghostly. she glances up for a fraction of a second locking eyes with her uncle she immediately looks away. maurice watches adelle move to her husband gerald and whispers in his ear. gerald changes instantly taking on the same ghostly transformation his eyes dart to maurice. ted's story is cut off as maurice speaks loudly...}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<A>__{the room goes silent as all eyes fall on adelle and gerald.}
<C>__{gerald}
<P>__{(shaking)}
<D>__{maurice, can we go into the dining room?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{what's happened to my wife?}
<A>__{this hits everyone in the room like a bomb. a dread hangs over every passing second... gerald crumbles under the moment... adelle begins to cry.}
<C>__{gerald}
<D>__{there was a car accident... drunk driver.}
<A>__{some of the crowd reacts. a women covers her mouth. the moment is unbearable.}
<C>__{maurice}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{please god don't do this.}
<A>__{gerald cracks the tears start to flow from his eyes.}
<C>__{gerald}
<D>__{maurice, it was serious... i don't know how to }
<A>__{gerald buries his face into the heels of his palms as if trying to contain an explosion in his head.}
<C>__{gerald}
<D>__{oh jesus, please help me... she didn't... ellen didn't make it... ellen's dead maurice.}
<A>__{maurice closes his eyes shut tightly... like a child scared of the dark. adelle blacks out, knocking over the wine chiller on the way to the ground. in less than a minute the room has transformed from a celebration to a mourning. everyone is frozen staring at maurice for their cue... a child in her mother's arms begins to cry as if aware of the circumstances.}
