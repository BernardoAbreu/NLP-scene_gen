<L>__{interior cold storage room night}
<A>__{except for the work table with its sharp gleaming in struments, the room is as barren and sterile as a morgue. the glass doored compartments in the walls look like crypts. some of them small as post office boxes. from one of the chew removes a vacuum, packed box. carefully separating the seal, he reaches into the purple jell and with a pair of tweezers extracts an eye. through the jeweler's glass, which he has not bothered to remove, chew holds the eye up to the light and studies it a moment. his other hand searches through his pockets.}
<C>__{chew}
<D>__{you got a pocket charger, boy?}
<A>__{quick to accommodate, sebastian removes a pencil like device from a row of such things in his breast pocket and steps closer. the back of the eye is touched with the pencil and the pupil moves. suddenly its staring back at them.}
<C>__{chew}
<D>__{is that good enough for your customer?}
<A>__{anxious to leave, sebastian nods. chew reseals the eye taking his time. he can afford to, he's wearing his coat.}
<C>__{chew}
<D>__{how much is he paying you?}
<A>__{in place of an answer, sebastian clears his throat, stares at the bag like he didn't hear.}
<C>__{chew}
<D>__{well, when do you get paid?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{soon as i finish the job.}
<C>__{chew}
<D>__{when might that be?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{day after tomorrow.}
<C>__{chew}
<D>__{oh! day after tomorrow.}
<A>__{sebastian nods. chew stares at the poor bastard, con cerned in spite of himself.}
<C>__{chew}
<D>__{the rich hate to pay, sebastian. a guy like tyrell keeps you waiting. pay the little guy last. you should charge twice as much. it'll make him feel better.}
<A>__{sebastian nods his head like that's exactly what he'll do. chew sees it's hopeless and hands him the bag.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{thanks, mr. chew.}
<A>__{chew pulls the door open for him and sebastian goes through quick as a dog.}
