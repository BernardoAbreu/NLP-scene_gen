<L>__{exterior school day}
<A>__{as emilio walks along, with cataleya, reading the list of supplies.}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{we'll get all this stuff, then go over to this little place i know down on maxwell street for some of these hot dogs the polish people make here.}
<A>__{he turns left at the cross street...}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{you like hot dogs?}
<A>__{he looks down, sees no cat. looks back to see cat walking in the opposite direction.}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{cat keeps going.}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{he hurries, catches up with her.}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{where you going?}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i've already been to school. i told you what i want to be. you don't want to help me, fine. i will do it myself.}
<A>__{she walks off. emilio grabs her.}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{chica. any idiot can be a killer. look!}
<A>__{emilio draws a .357 magnum pistol from his shoulder holster, and empties the entire clip into the front of a car coming down the street. the car careens off the road, smashes a fire hydrant, crashes through a plate glass window of a shop across the street. the water from the hydrant shoot twenty feet in the air. emilio holsters his gun.}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{you want me to teach you to be a killer? no problema. i will teach you. but you'll be dead in five years.}
<C>__{emilio }
<D>__{if you want to be a killer, and survive, you have to be a smart one. you have to know things besides how to pull a trigger. you have to know how the world works. how people think. you got to learn to be psychological. that i cannot teach you, unless you learn the basics at school. got it?}
<A>__{cat glares at him.}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{now what's it going to be?}
<A>__{he holds out the gun in one hand, and the schoolbag in the other. cat hesitates for a moment. takes the schoolbag from emilio. then takes his hand, and they walk off together as police sirens announce the arrival of cruisers, and people pour out of the school and the surrounding stores. as they put distance between the chaos and themselves.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{but i still want to be a killer.}
<C>__{emilio}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{cabron!}
