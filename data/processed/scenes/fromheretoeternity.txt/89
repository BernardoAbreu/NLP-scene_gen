<B>__{full shot luau}
<A>__{shot covers the continuation of all the above activity. this is a native luau definitely not for tourists. shot includes long ditches, heated by red hot stones and lined with layers of banana leaves, containing pig, chicken, rock crabs, fish... pots of native stew... bowls of exotic fruit... peels of raw cane... working over the food are the natives, many of the men stripped to the waist, the women arrayed in colorful hawaiian costumes.}
<B>__{long shot through bonfire hula dancers}
<A>__{a group of male dancers swaying with the insistent beat of a group of old hawaiian instruments. this is far removed from the night club hula. this is a thing of swift, agile angularity, primitive and powerful.}
<B>__{pan shot spectators through bonfire}
<A>__{at end of pan, camera reveals warden and karen in the group. they are the only whites in the group.}
<B>__{close shot karen}

<A>__{the men laugh and grin as they dance, taunt and tease somebody o.s.}
<B>__{medium shot spectators}
<A>__{they shout and laugh and squeal with delight as they watch. it is warden the dancers are teasing. several of the dancers break out of the group, dance over to warden, continue to prod him, apparently urging him to join them.}
<B>__{medium close shot warden}
<A>__{protesting, joining in the laughter. suddenly he kicks off his shoes, rolls his slacks up to his knees. he snatches a gardenia from the hair of a pretty hawaiian girl next to him, sticks it over his ear, jumps into the firelight and dances with the others. the music comes up louder and faster as the spectators and dancers roar.}
<B>__{group shot dancers and warden}
<A>__{they are all laughing as they dance, but as warden moves with them it is apparent he is as good as any of them.}
<B>__{medium shot spectators}
<A>__{nodding, pointing at warden, their hilarious laughter fading to delighted smiles.}
<B>__{close shot karen}
<A>__{astonished and thrilled at warden's ability.}
<B>__{medium shot warden}
<A>__{his laughter now also diminished to a happy grin as he dances. in all he dances about thirty seconds. then he breaks out of the group and runs over to karen.}
<B>__{group shot featuring karen and warden}
<A>__{as the spectators and dancers shout their applause. warden comes up to karen and puts the gardenia in her hair. karen is glowing, tingling.}

<D>__{you just love to shock people, don't you?! where on earth did you learn to dance like that?}
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(panting happily)}
<D>__{believe it or not chicago, illinois.}
<A>__{she flings her arms around him passionately. the onlookers howl with approval and merriment. between karen and warden and camera, an enormously fat hawaiian woman pours water on the stones in one of the trench ovens. a cloud of steam rises, hiding them.}
