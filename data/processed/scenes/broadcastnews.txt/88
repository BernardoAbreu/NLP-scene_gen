<L>__{interior jane's editing cubicle morning}
<A>__{jane feeds another tape in she is taking editing notes alone and scratching her arm. she looks worn out stock footage of statesmen move across the small screen. she sighs and, without realizing, implores the heavens to help cure a malady she's yet to recognize in herself.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{god help me.}
<A>__{people have begun to filter into the newsroom in the b.g.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{jesus, jane. how long have you been here?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{a long time. i was restless. will you crack my neck?}
<A>__{he starts massaging her neck as the phone rings. she lets it ring for a beat as aaron works on her. as she picks up the receiver we hear a crack. she reacts to it at the same time she utters a greeting.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{aaah }
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{ ello. you sure they said the management meeting?}
<P>__{(hangs up; then to aaron)}
<D>__{they want me to be at the management meeting.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{they're not that dumb, after all.}
<A>__{he pats her on the back.}
