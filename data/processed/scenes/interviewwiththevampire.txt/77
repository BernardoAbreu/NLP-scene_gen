<L>__{interior cathedral night}
<A>__{louis enters. the dim lights of candles. a sacristan tending the altar, an old woman praying otherwise empty.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i had no fear. if anything i longed for something to happen, for the stones to tremble as i entered the foyer.}
<A>__{louis walking down the nave of the church. he stops by the alter.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i almost genuflected from old habit. i almost prayed.}
<A>__{louis sits in a pew.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{and then it struck me.}
<A>__{louis' pov the cross, the statues, the tabernacle.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what if the statues gave an image to nothing? what if i was the supernatural in this cathedral? the only immortal under this roof. and i felt nothing but loneliness. loneliness to the point of madness.}
<A>__{suddenly a hand is laid on his shoulder. louis almost jumps. he turns and sees the face of a grey haired priest.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{you wish to go to confession? i was about to lock up the church.}
<A>__{louis stares at him, tears in his eyes.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{you are troubled, aren't you? can i help?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{it's too late, too late }
<C>__{preist}
<D>__{no, it's never too late. come...}
<A>__{the priest gestures to the confessional. louis rises, slowly.}
