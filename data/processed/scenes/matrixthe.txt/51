<A>__{neo's face is knotted, teeth clenched, as he hurls himself at morpheus.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{good. adaption. improvisation. but your weakness isn't your technique.}
<A>__{morpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen. his feet and fists are everywhere taking neo apart. for every blow neo blocks, five more hit their marks until neo falls. panting, on his hands and knees, blood spits fror, his mouth speckling the white floor of the dojo.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{how did i beat you?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{you you're too fast.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?}
<A>__{neo is frustrated, still unable to catch his breath.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{do you believe that's air you are breathing now?}
<A>__{neo squints at him.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{if you can free your mind, the body will follow.}
<A>__{neo stands, nodding.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{again.}
<A>__{their fists fly with pneumatic speed.}
