<A>__{the bug parked nearby. penelope sits on the curb, crying. bloom sits next to her.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{what did it mean?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{what did it say?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{"we're all of us marks in our own cons." and she said goodbye.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{i still can't believe it.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{that the chink fell for a car bomb? neither can i.}
<C>__{penelope}
<P>__{(hopeful)}
<D>__{what? oh, oh god do you think she faked it? so the russians would think she was dead?}
<A>__{bloom stands, paces away. he leafs limply through the manila folder addresses, pictures, information... a paper with the dog's photo clipped to it. an address in st. petersburg. the napkin stephen wrote the con flowchart on. the third box "the end."}
<C>__{penelope }
<D>__{what do we do now?}
<A>__{scrawled on the inside of the manila envelope "an unwritten life." bloom's face clears. he wipes his eyes.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{bloom goes to the bug.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{this wasn't russians. this was done by an old mentor of ours who wants us off the map. he has an apartment in st. petersburg. so this is, yeah. i've gotta go back to that apartment to face the dog and get my brother back. that's how i'm gonna end this.}
<A>__{penelope's eyes gleam. she jumps up to the passenger door, and bloom stops her with a weary look.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{we can skip the whole you sending me nobly away and me refusing to leave your side thing.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{thank christ.}
