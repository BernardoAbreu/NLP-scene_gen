<L>__{interior sam's bedroom night}
<A>__{sam is in bed, grappling with the bedclothes. he is dripping with sweat and screaming. the room is oppressively hot. he gets up and looks at the thermostat. it reads 99. he fumbles with it, but to no avail. it's stuck.}
<T>__{cut :}
<A>__{to sam coming into the sitting room. he rushes over to the window and tries to open it. but it wasn't designed to be opened. screws hold it firmly shut. sam heads to the kitchen he finds a knife which he uses to unscrew the window. he swings the window open and takes a deep breath. gag! cough! hack! a terrible greeny brown smog pours in through the window. desperately sam shuts the window and madly tightens up the screws. swinging a newspaper, he tries clearing a path through the clouded atmosphere. he makes it to the front door and staggers out into the hall gasping for air.}
