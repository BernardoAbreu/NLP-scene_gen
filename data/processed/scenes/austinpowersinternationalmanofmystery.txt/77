<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{we don't judge here.}
<C>__{scott evil}
<D>__{ok. well, i just really met my dad for the first time three days ago. he was partially frozen for thirty years. i never knew him growing up. he comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{and how do you feel about that?}
<C>__{scott evil}
<D>__{i don't wanna take over the family business.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{but scott, who's going to take over the world when i die?}
<C>__{scott evil}
<D>__{not me.}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{what do you want to do, scott?}
<C>__{scott evil}
<D>__{i don't know. i was thinking, maybe i'd be a vet or something, cause i like animals and stuff.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{an evil vet?}
<C>__{scott evil}
<D>__{no. maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{an evil petting zoo?}
<C>__{scott evil}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{you always do that!}
<P>__{(calm)}
<D>__{anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my dad is really evil.}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{we don't label people here, scott.}
<C>__{scott evil}
<D>__{no, he's really evil.}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{scott.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{no, the boy's right. i really am evil.}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{don't be so hard on yourself. you're here, that's what's important. a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.}
<C>__{scott evil}
<D>__{i just think, like, he hates me. i really think he wants to kill me.}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{ok, scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. they say it, but they don't mean it.}
<A>__{the group laughs.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{actually, the boy's quite astute. i am trying to kill him. my evil associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{we've heard from scott, now let's hear from you.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{the details of my life are quite inconsequential.}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{that's not true, doctor. please, tell us about your childhood.}
<C>__{group}
<D>__{yes, of course. go ahead, etc.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{very well, where should i begin? my father was a relentlessly self improving boulangerie owner from belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. my mother was a fifteen year old french prostitute named chloe with webbed feet. my father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims, like he invented the question mark. sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. a sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. my childhood was typical. summers in rangoon, luge lessons. in the spring we'd make meat helmets. if i was insolent, i was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds. pretty standard, really. at the age of twelve i received my first scribe. at the age of fifteen, a zoroastrian named vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. there really is nothing like a shorn scrotum. at the age of eighteen, i went off to evil medical school. from there...}
