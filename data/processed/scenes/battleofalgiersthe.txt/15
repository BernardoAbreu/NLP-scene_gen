<D>__{there is an arab cafe at rue random 40. the owner's name is medjebri. he is a police informer ...}
<A>__{medjebri is standing behind the cash register, smiling, very busy. he is wearing a traditional costume. he is very clearly visible through the shop window above the heads of the customers. in a doorway near the cafe there is a clock hanging from a signboard in front of a store. it is five o'clock. a french policeman enters the cafe.}

<D>__{every day at 5 p.m., a french policeman goes to see him. he stops for a few minutes to get information with the excuse of drinking a cup of tea. you have to kill the policeman ...}
<C>__{ali}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{not medjebri?}
<A>__{medjebri moves away from the register, still standing behind the bar, to where the policeman is seated. he greets him, and hands him a cup of tea.}
<C>__{omar}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{no. it says the policeman.}
<A>__{the policeman is leaning on the bar. he is tall and husky, and is wearing a scruffy uniform with a kepi pushed back somewhat. now his thick lips are sipping the scalding mint tea.}
<C>__{ali}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{okay ...}
<A>__{the large clock and store signboard. standing in front, there is a slender girl, veiled, her eyes darting in contrast with the rigid form of her motionless body. her arms are raised to form an arch, her hands supporting the edges of a large basket balanced on her head.}

<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{at the corner, right in front of the large clock, there will be a girl carrying a basket. when the policeman comes out, you will follow him together. at the right moment she will give you a pistol. you have only to shoot ... quickly and in the back.}
<A>__{now the policeman has finished drinking his tea. he makes a sign to pay. smiling, medjebri refuses the money, and says good bye. ali approaches the girl. they exchange glances. the girl puts down her basket which is filled with corn, and rests it by her side. she moves slowly toward the cafe. ali walks beside her. the policeman is coming out of the cafe. he rudely bumps into those who are entering. he makes his way along the sidewalk, and moves further away, balancing his heavy body at every step. ali and the girl are about a yard away from him. they follow him, pushed along with the many others who are crowded on the sidewalk. then the girl plunges her hand into the corn. in a second, she places the revolver in ali's right hand. he holds it under his cloak. the policeman's back is a hand's bredth away. but ali does not shoot. he moves forward to pass by the policeman. alarmed, the girl looks at him, and tries to hold him back. she shakes her head as if to speak. ali smiles at her. his eyes have a hard glinterior he moves a few steps past the policeman. suddenly ali turns, lifts his arm as if to push his way through, and then stretches out his hand with the revolver aimed. the policeman stops; his eyes are wide with fear. instinctively he lifts his arms and opens his palms. terror paralyzes him. ali glances about him. many people are moving away hastily, but others stand still in a circle and watch fascinated. ali speaks to all of them, in a loud voice. his eyes are alight.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{don't move! look at him. you're not giving any orders now! your hands are up, eh! do you see him, brothers? our masters aren't very special, are they?}
<A>__{a sharp, metallic click. ali tries a second time, presses the trigger again.}
<B>__{several clicks. revolver empty.}
<A>__{ali rolls the gun barrel; it is empty. the policeman slowly lowers his hands. his right hand rushes to his holster. ali is ready to jump, throws away the gun, and starts to move forward. he knocks down the policeman, who is overwhelmed, and falls backward. the crowd moves away quickly. ali starts to throw himself on the frenchman lying on the ground, but stops halfway. a thought restrains him. he turns and sees the girl who has picked up the revolver and hidden it again in her basket. then she moves away hurriedly. ali curses angrily, then, kicks the policeman's head twice, and runs after the girl. he reaches her, grabs her shoulder so roughly that she shouts.}

<D>__{bastard! ... bitch!}
<A>__{the girl struggles free from his grip. at the same time, they hear behind them ...}
<B>__{police whistles.}
<A>__{the girl quickens her step.}
