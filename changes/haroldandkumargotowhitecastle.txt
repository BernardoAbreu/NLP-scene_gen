<CHAR>__{HAROLD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Actually, I'm Kor...wait a second-- she talks about me?}
<ACTION>__{A HOT BLACK CHICK (AISHA), wearing only a bra and g-string, walks over to Luis and wraps her arms around him...}

<CHAR>__{KUMAR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Whatever. I'll tell my dad to reschedule it. He won't have a problem, as long as I'm taking it seriously for a change. Now, let's fly to Europe and find Maria!}
