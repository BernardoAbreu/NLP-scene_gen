<A>__{the camera rushing over a circuit pattern, like the one we saw at the opening of the film'. the pattern changes, dissolving into another image and we are rushing forward at great speed. we see the circuits rushing by and getting larger and then the picture dissolves into darkness with a glowing, spinning globe beneath us, like the globe from aic's logo, covered with circuits. we are rushing at it, circling it, diving closer and closer, so that the detail on the globe becomes clearer with every second and we realize that the circuits are structures, angular towers and buildings, huge mechanical looking mountains and deserts covered with a glowing grid pattern. everything glows with an internal energy. we continue diving, down, down, faster and faster and we see the structures of one city like area across electronic mesas and cliffs, and then we're right over this area and diving straight down, everything blurring with the speed.}
