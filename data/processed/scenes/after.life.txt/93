<L>__{interior paul's apartment. bathroom continuous}
<A>__{nothing. the bathroom's empty. paul looks around nervously. he catches the reflection of his pallid face in the mirror. leans wearily against the washbasin. water drips from a leaky pipe. the fluorescent bulb over the mirror crackles softly. paul turns on the taps. splashes cold water on his face. he's about to reach for a towel when he senses something. he cocks his head slightly. a feeling. he turns and checks out the bathroom. nothing. paul dries his face. as he replaces the towel... the sound of dripping water abruptly stops. silence. suddenly the shower starts running. paul's paralyzed with fear. steam wreathes the room in a cloud of vapor. he turns slowly towards the shower. paul's pov anna stands in front of the shower with her back to him. she slips off her bathrobe and hangs it on a hook. then her hand moves to her chest. there's a strange wet sucking sound... ...as anna rips out her heart and hangs it casually on the hook next to her bathrobe.}

<A>__{anna turns slowly. her skin's like alabaster. unnaturally translucent. a bloody gash where her heart used to be. the steam from the shower curls around her like a mist. she looks hauntingly beautiful. mesmerizing. a line of thick black fluid trickles from her nose. paul turns away. horrified. when he turns back a second later anna's not there. the bathroom's empty. the shower's not even running.}
