<L>__{interior yasnaya polyana. sofya's bedroom. night.}
<A>__{close on sofya lying in bed. she looks ravishing in the candle light. in the background, tolstoy arrives in the bedroom door.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{sofya.}
<A>__{a sly smile on her lips, the tension gone from her face, she seems twenty years younger.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{sofya, are you ill?}
<A>__{she rolls toward him making it clear she's quite naked under the sheets. this is no sick bed.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{i'm fine...now that you're home.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{it's no good, you know, all this. you frightened everyone.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{did i really? i don't believe it. not you. i'm your little bird. you know the sounds i make.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{that was some sort of love call?}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{it brought you back to me.}
<A>__{she reaches out her hand to him.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{come out of the dark... where i can see you.}
<A>__{he takes a step toward her, then stops.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{why? why? why, do you do it? we live in the country and you insist on making it an opera house. what's wrong with a little peace now and then?}
<A>__{sofya laughs.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{look at me. this is who i am. this is what you married. we're older, maybe we're old, but i'm still your little chicken}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you're still my big cock.}
<A>__{she smiles at him.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{let me make you crow.}
<A>__{a pause, then a huge laugh comes up from the very center of him. he twists his neck, thrusts his head upward, crows like a rooster. he virtually runs to her, embraces her, kisses her. she is a giddy girl in his arms. he breaks the embrace and begins strutting around the room.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{let me make you sing.}
<A>__{he takes her in his arms, again, begins to kiss her neck.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{do you love me?}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{sofia}
<D>__{i want you to love me.}
<A>__{he stops kissing her, looks her in the eye. then, another loud crow. laughing, they fall into each other again.}
