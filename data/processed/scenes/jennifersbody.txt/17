<T>__{smash cut to:}
<L>__{interior bathroom same}
<A>__{we see a lone, nasty looking toilet covered in band}
<B>__{stickers.}
<T>__{back on needy:}
<A>__{needy and jennifer enter the bar. every guy in the joint stares at jennifer, who snaps her "minor" wristband distastefully.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{god, i can't wait until i'm old enough to get wasted. have you ever had peach schnapps?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{peach schnapps are excellent. they even taste good when they come out of your nose mid puke.}
<A>__{a teenage guy, craig, passes by and waves.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{hi jennifer. you look nice.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(without enthusiasm)}
<D>__{what up, craig.}
<A>__{she elbows needy and makes a gagging gesture.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{he thinks he's cute enough for me. no wonder he's in retard math.}
<A>__{jennifer pulls out a pack of camel wides and lights one awkwardly. needy notices ahmet from india, a foreign exchange student, standing by himself away from the crowd.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{hey, it's ahmet from india. the foreign exchange guy. he's all by himself.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i can't believe we traded a cute hockey player for that.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{he seems okay. he's got that cool elephant statue in his locker.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{do you think he's circumcised? i always wanted to try sea cucumber.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{ew!}
<A>__{roman duda saunters up to jennifer, swigging a bottle of beer. he snatches the pack of cigarettes away from her.}
<C>__{roman}
<D>__{you're smoking dicks now, jen?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{what? i like the wides.}
<A>__{she sticks the fat cigarette between her lips and inhales pointedly.}
<C>__{roman}
<D>__{i just bet you do. i should arrest you for possession under the legal age.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{arrest me, pfft! you're not even out of the academy yet, roman!}
<C>__{roman}
<D>__{two more months and i'm on the force for real. then i will be able to cuff you whenever the hell i want.}
<A>__{he grips her wrist and twists it behind her back.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{how will i wait that long?}
<A>__{she paws roman's crotch discreetly. needy winces.}
<C>__{roman}
<D>__{not here, babe. i gotta keep my nose clean.}
<C>__{needy}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{look, there's the band!}
<A>__{a group of skinny indie rock boys are setting up their equipment on a pathetically tiny stage it's more like a dais. the lead singer has intense, spooky eyes, nearly obscured by a shock of hair. the locals, mostly good ol' boys, eye the band suspiciously.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{you can tell they're from the city.}
<C>__{roman}
<D>__{yeah, `cause they look like a bunch of faygos.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{you would think that. you're such a small time gomer. i wish we had more guys like that in devil's kettle. all stylish and shit.}
<A>__{needy nods dumbly. she stares at the band, awestruck.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{they look so so cool.}
<A>__{she gazes at the stage, hearing only the whistling rush of arctic air. in slow motion, the guitarist unsheathes his fender jaguar from its gig bag. he notices her staring and runs the tip of his tongue over his lips. needy swallows hard.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{hey, i think they need two groupies. come on! it'll be like almost famous! i will be penny lane and you can be the other girl.}
<A>__{she grabs needy's hand and enthusiastically tries to drag her toward the stage.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{don't be j.v., needy. they're just boys. morsels. we have all the power, don't you know that?}
<A>__{she plants her hands on needy's chest.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{these things are like smart bombs. point `em in the right direction and shit gets real.}
<A>__{needy shrugs free of jennifer's grasp and follows her reluctantly across the room. the lead singer of soft shoulder, nikolai wolf, is already striding forward to meet them at the lip of the stage. his gait is as smooth as his shock of dyed black hair.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{hi. um, we just really wanted to meet you or something? i'm jennifer check and this is my friend.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i'm nikolai wolf, and this is my band.}
<A>__{he reaches down and pumps jennifer's outstretched hand.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(awkward)}
<D>__{yeah! soft shoulder, right? i've heard you guys are super, super good at playing your instruments.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i hope we can live up to such...high praise.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{hey, if you don't mind me asking, why did you want to play all the way out here in devil's kettle? you live in the city, right?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{yeah. but i think it's so important to connect with our fans in rural areas. plus, the audiences in small towns really appreciate us.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{can i show you my appreciation right now?}
<A>__{needy looks at the floor, embarrassed. jennifer's voice scales up nervously.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{like, i will buy you a drink? i mean, i will see if i can get you a drink. they make this great 9 11 tribute shooter? it's red, white and blue, but you have to drink it fast or it gets all brownish.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<P>__{(grimacing)}
<D>__{mmm.}
<A>__{jennifer hurries off toward the bar. needy moves self consciously into a nearby corner, not wanting to continue the conversation with nikolai alone. a local plugs a loretta lynn tune into the jukebox, with a challenging stare at the band. a drunk couple begins two stepping in front of the stage. nikolai walks up to the guitar player, dirk, and pulls him aside. needy pricks up her ears and listens.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{dirk, what about her?}
<C>__{dirk}
<P>__{(gesturing to needy)}
<D>__{who, training bra jones?}
<A>__{needy looks offended.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{no, the hot one. the one who just walked away. she's it, man. she's exactly what we're looking for.}
<C>__{dirk}
<D>__{you're sure she's...}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{she's a kid. we're in god's country, man. everyone out here's a fundie bible banger. of course she's a virgin.}
<A>__{dirk hesitates.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{dirk, we didn't haul our asses out to this corn palace for nothing!}
<C>__{dirk}
<D>__{fine. okay. you know, i know i'm not "just the bassist." i'm a person who happens to play the bass guitar. and i would like some respect...}
<A>__{nikolai is already ignoring him. needy, alarmed, emerges from her hiding place and discreetly rushes over to the bar where jennifer is arguing with a jealous looking roman. he shakes his head in disgust and leaves the bar. jennifer walks over holding an ostentatious patriotic themed drink. she laughs when she sees needy's concerned expression.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{what? are you scared of rock stars too?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{those guys are rank, jen. just forget about it.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i think the singer wants me.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{only because he thinks you're a virgin. i heard them talking.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{yeah, right! i'm not even a backdoor virgin anymore, thanks to roman. by the way, that hurts. i couldn't even go to flags the next day. i had to stay home and sit on a bag of frozen peas.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{well, if nikolai wants innocent, i can do innocent. i will be little miss fucking sunshine.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{he's way too old for you.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{don't cock block me, needy.}
<A>__{piercing feedback signals the beginning of the set. nikolai takes the mic and smiles broadly.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{good evening, devil's lake.}
<A>__{someone in the back shouts "devil's kettle!"}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{sorry. anyway, we're soft shoulder. and we just want to make you happy.}
<A>__{he winks at jennifer. the band launch into the same intense, soaring song we heard in the cop car and the hole. jennifer's eyes never leave nikolai's. she's hypnotized, clinging to needy's arm. even the locals look charmed. suddenly, a lick of flame appears on the wood paneling next to the stage. needy is the first to notice. as she watches in horror, the fire is reflected in her glasses. the flames quickly climbs up to the ceiling and begin to blaze uncontrollably. people scream and scatter. someone ineffectually tries to throw a pitcher of beer on the fire. nikolai turns and sees the fire spreading. he and chas exchange glances. the bass player pitches his guitar aside and jumps off the stage, and the drummer abandons his kit. nikolai seems perfectly cool and composed as he watches from the stage...is he smiling? chaos. everyone is trying to get out of the bar at once, causing a stampede. a woman's clothes and hair catch fire and she falls to her knees. we see a beam fall from the roof, nearly killing ahmet from india. jennifer stands still in a dreamlike state.}
<C>__{needy}
<P>__{(to jennifer)}
<D>__{i know where to go!}
<A>__{needy grabs jennifer by the elbow and pulls her into the tiny bathroom. choking on smoke, they climb onto the sticker toilet (which now sports a giant soft shoulder sticker on the tank) and boost each other out the bathroom window. hundreds are still trapped inside, screaming.}
