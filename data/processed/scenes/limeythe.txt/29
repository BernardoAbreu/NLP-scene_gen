<L>__{exterior the building.}
<A>__{wilson crosses over to it now. from sunny to shade. walks past the chain link fence. the padlocked gate, big enough to accommodate the (couple of) trucks parked within the compound. walks past the closed security door which would appear to be the building's main entrance. round the next corner sees there's a steel back door as well. comes around this block again. looking surreptitiously around now. streets here utterly deserted. not even a passing car. crappy residential building on an opposite corner, spanish music blaring from one of the open windows, but not with a direct view on the loading yard fence on this side. wilson nearing it now taking something out of his pocket. one of the mysterious metallic tools from his travel kit. snaps his wrist, unfolding the tool with a crack. wire cutters. he doesn't go for the gate, the padlock, like we might have thought. he suddenly drops to one knee, in shadow where the fence meets the adjoining building. snap, snap, snap, snap, snap so quick, with great dexterity, though his face grimaces with the strength he has to exert with each application of pressure he cuts just as many links as he knows he needs to push in a little flap of fence and roll under. whole thing accomplished in seconds.}
<B>__{loading yard}
<A>__{walks fast to the cover of the trucks. passes. looks around. cement loading docks and bays. shuttered doors. he jumps up to one, puts his ear to the metal. listens awhile.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{scans the wall for any sign of an alarm box or anything. then cocks an ear upwards... camera craning up to show us what he hears: an air conditioning unit humming away. which means someone must be inside. wilson looks back at his entry options. not the loading doors but a conventional door at one end, with a conventional lock his eye zeroes in on. gets out his tools, going over.}
