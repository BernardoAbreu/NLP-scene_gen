<L>__{interior volvo day}
<A>__{hawk, trip, and lex look up at father mcnulty's window.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{usually takes anywhere from ten minutes to half an hour.}
<A>__{they look at their watches, then back at the window.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{shit! this is such a lousy view. how the hell are we gonna know when he's lit?}
<A>__{just then, insane laughter bellows from the window above.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{he's lit.}
<L>__{interior father mcnulty's office day}
<A>__{the father has undergone a metamorphosis. he's redder than a boiling lobster, his eyes bulge and he's laughing the deepest laugh a man can without risking psychological evaluation. jam watches fascinated as the priest tries to finish the story. it's not every day you see a holy man tripping on shrooms.}
<C>__{father mcnulty}
<P>__{(in mid guffaw)}
<D>__{so then, the younger one says, "but dad... i've been helping you on the farm my entire life!}
<P>__{(belly laugh)}
<D>__{you never once slaughtered the fatted calf for me!" and then...}
<P>__{(more belly laughter)}
<D>__{forgive me, jeremiah, it's just that... i've been telling this gospel for years and... i just now realized it's the work of some comedy mastermind! the prodigal son is a barrel of fucking monkeys!}
<A>__{father mcnulty belly laughs so hard this time, he slides off his chair hitting his chin on the edge of his desk. he is in pain only momentarily, then laughs again, this time at his own pratfall. he hoists himself back into his chair. hawk, trip, and lex suddenly barge into the office, followed by the outraged nun.}
<C>__{nun}
<D>__{you kids can't go in there!}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{it's okay, we're old buds of father mcnulty... how's it hangin', padre?}
<C>__{father mcnulty}
<D>__{a little to the right, pizza fellow.}
<A>__{father mcnulty laughs some more.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{that was another dude. anyway, we're here to take our bud jam to the big satanic kiss concert tonight. okay with you?}
<C>__{father mcnulty}
<P>__{(waving)}
<D>__{rock on!}
<A>__{jam gets up and all four boys exit.}
<C>__{father mcnulty}
<P>__{(yelling after them)}
<D>__{give my regards to the guy with the really big tongue!}
<A>__{the nun looks at the priest, deep concern in her eyes.}
<C>__{father mcnulty}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing, sister gonorrhea, waiting for a bus?}
<A>__{he lets out a belly laugh as the shocked nun runs from the office. father mcnulty laughs even louder at her behavior, pounding his fists on the desk, tears rolling down his cheeks, until... he suddenly glimpses at the painting of the virgin mary and abruptly stops laughing. what appears to be extreme contrition washes over his face as he moves closer to the painting.}
<C>__{father mcnulty}
<D>__{jesus h. christ, look at all the colors.}
