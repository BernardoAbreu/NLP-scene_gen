<L>__{interior apartment living room night}
<A>__{mace watches zander lighting bottle rockets with curtis on the balcony of the apartment... visible through the window. staccato fireworks nearby sound like automatic weapons, making her flinch. she goes back into the... kitchen. where she sees lenny sitting at the table, trodes in his hands. stunned. face the color of old cement. hands shaking.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{tell me.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i can't tell you. you've got to see.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{uh unh. i won't do it.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{mace. i know what you think about the wire. but i'm asking you to do this. it's that important.}
<A>__{mace sees how serious he is. she nods: ok. he puts the trodes on her.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{sorry this has to be your first playback.}
<A>__{he hits play and mace reacts as the sensory input hits her. she opens her eyes...}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{keep your eyes closed, or you'll see double.}
<A>__{she bites her lip as the sensation of being another person floods through her. pov sequence: we are iris. riding in a car. fixing our makeup in a mirror on the passenger side sun visor. iris flips the sun visor back up, revealing the moving street. it is night. we look down, and recognize the dress iris was wearing when we first saw her, two nights ago. she puts her lipstick into a purse which is belted to her waist. iris turns her head and we see the driver. it is jeriko one. he is laughing, talking to someone in the back seat. iris looks and we see replay, jeriko's sideman, and another woman, diamanda. they are amorously entwined. then they are all laughing and passing around a bottle of jim beam. the car stereo is thumping loudly. iris' pov swings around and looks down, seeing jeriko's hand caressing her thigh. she puts her hand on his chest and leans close to him. jeriko grins, then looks up and swears at a wash of red blue cop flash.}
<C>__{jeriko}
<D>__{shit. fuckin' five o}
<A>__{our pov swings to the rear view mirror and we see an lapd car behind us, with the gumball machine on. a spotlight hits us and we hear a single whoop on the siren. jeriko pulls over, but they are on an overpass... no shoulder.}
<C>__{cop voice}
<P>__{(on bullhorn)}
<D>__{go to the bottom of the ramp.}
<A>__{jeriko and replay are both swearing. he pulls the car down the ramp, stopping on a deserted street in a warehouse district. our pov looks around nervously. black shadows and concrete pillars. no one around. cars whoosh by on the bridge above but they might as well be on mars. the car is stopped next to a train yard. we hear the rumble of diesels nearby, the clank of freightcars. we see the outlines of two cops advancing through the beam of the spotlight, their guns drawn.}
<C>__{jeriko}
<P>__{(jumping out of the car)}
<D>__{goddamn, now what you pull me over for? if i was going any slower i'd be parked }
<C>__{cop voice 1}
<D>__{get down on your knees and put your hands on your head. now!}
<C>__{cop voice 2}
<D>__{everyone else, out of the car and down on the ground.}
<A>__{our pov comes up and out of the car. jeriko is righteously pissed off. he's not following orders.}
<C>__{cop voice 1}
<D>__{put your hands behind your head right now!}
<A>__{he goes along, madder than ever. the cops get replay down on his knees as well, in the wet gutter next to the curb. the cops are closer now. we see that they are spreg and}
<B>__{engelman.}
<C>__{engelman}
<P>__{(to us)}
<D>__{put your hands on the hood of the car and don't move.}
<A>__{we exchange a look with diamanda. fucking cops. but jeriko is winding them up. not giving them the pleasure of the humiliation. you can see it escalating.}
<C>__{jeriko}
<D>__{i suppose you stopped us cause you had suspects fitting our description in the area, what you're gonna tell me. what was the description? two black males in a car? yeah, right, i heard that one before...}
<A>__{as engelman pulls out jeriko's wallet, looks at his id, jeriko checks name tags.}
<C>__{jeriko}
<D>__{well you stopped the wrong black male tonight officer... what is it? spreg. officer spreg. cause i'm the 800 pound gorilla in your mist, fucker. i make more in a day than you make in a year, and my lawyers love to spend my money dragging sorry ass aryan robocops like you into court. get a man down on the ground with no probable cause. fuck you!}
<C>__{spreg}
<D>__{shut the fuck up!}
<A>__{he kicks jeriko down on his face. jeriko hits the ground hard.}

<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{leave the fuck off of us, we weren't doing anything...}
<C>__{spreg}
<D>__{shut up! don't make me walk over there.}
<A>__{engelman shows the id to spreg, saying something we can't hear.}
<C>__{spreg}
<D>__{you're that rap puke? jeriko one? you're the one getting all the gangbangers to form citizens groups and go downtown... trying to rake the lapd over a cheese grater?}
<C>__{jeriko}
<D>__{that's right. and you're gonna be in my next song, motherfucker, it's called robo spreg.}
<A>__{replay starts laughing. diamanda stifles a giggle. spreg is white lipped with rage. years of frustration coming to a head. too many disciplinary actions, too many suspensions, too little appreciation of the tough job they do.}
<C>__{jeriko}
<D>__{it's a song about a cop who meets his worst nightmare, a nigger with enough political juice to crush his ass like a stink bug. you're gonna be famous.}
<A>__{spreg looks around the empty street. looks at engelman. down at jeriko, proned out on the pavement. replay's laughter in his ears.}
<C>__{spreg}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{and shoots him blam! blam! twice in the back of the head. just like that. diamanda screams. replay tries to roll to his feet. spreg shoots him twice in the stomach. replay is screaming. rolling around, holding his guts.}
<C>__{spreg}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{hey... i don't hear you laughing!}
<A>__{engelman's yelling something at him we can't hear. spreg turns, eyes wide with adrenaline.}
<C>__{spreg}
<D>__{get the bitches.}
<A>__{engelman hesitates and then spins toward us. diamanda is screaming, backing away from engelman. spreg shoots replay four more times. we spin one eighty and start to run. hear shots... blam! blam! blam! spin back... to see diamanda dropping to her knees. engelman shoots her again. then raises his gun toward us. we spin away. the world becomes a kinetic blur. the sound of shots. we see puffs of dust on the ground in front of us. missed shots. we tumble over a guardrail and roll down an embankment... get up and keep running. train tracks ahead. looking back... here come spreg and engelman down the embankment, overtaking us. we hear the thunder of a train... spinning again to look forward. freight train doing fifty on the nearest track. almost to us. we leap forward. over the track. the diesel roars past behind us. looking back... a black wall of moving steel. backing away from it. we see engelman and spreg crouching down... trying to aim through the wheels. hear the impotent pop of their guns over the roar of the train. turning to run again. we see a tiny hole appear in a sign right in front of us with a metallic spang. running and running. looking back. no pursuit. train still rolling by. can't see the cops. running, running. heart pounding and lungs heaving. sobbing sounds coming from somewhere, seeming to fill the night. looking down... one shoe on, one shoe off. iris' hand takes off the remaining shoe, clutches it to her chest. we move forward into the dark train yard as }
<B>__{the tape ends.}
<A>__{and mace sits stone still. shakes. for a beat. and another. then she tears the trodes off and throws them across the room, near where lenny is on the cellular.}
