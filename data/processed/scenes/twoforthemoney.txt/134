<L>__{interior walter's office day}
<A>__{sales staff crowd into the room. walter and brandon sit side by side. seconds before kickoff of the new york atlanta game. julia climbs into walter's lap, holding her puppy. julia can i watch, daddy?}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{sure, angel. i need you to root for me. (pointing at atlanta) they're the bad guys. atlanta. we want the blue team. new york. they have to win by more than five points. and root for a low score. both teams have to make less than 42 points total. new york and under 42 points.}
<C>__{julia}
<A>__{why do we like the blue team?}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{because brandon likes them. julia looks at brandon, smiles. brandon's barely holding up here, forces himself to find a smile in return. the tv fills frame. new york kicks off. an atlanta receiver takes it back for a 60 yard return. we start cutting from the game to brandon, to walter, the salespeople, julia, all reacting as the betting gods raise hopes one play, dash them the nexterior play after play. tide going for new york one minute, atlanta the nexterior tension in the room building. everyone crowds the tvs as new york defends a 10 point lead with a minute left.}
