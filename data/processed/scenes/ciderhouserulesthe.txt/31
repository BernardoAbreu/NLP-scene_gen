<L>__{interior dispensary night}
<A>__{with his head inclined to the giant ear of larch's phonograph, fuzzy six, thin, and pale and looking remarkably like an embryo is listening to a recording. he can't hear what larch and homer are saying about him as they construct a humidified tent over a small hospital bed on wheels. the humidifier is operated by a car battery.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{fuzzy is not uncommon. i tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. they seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{i haven't read that.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{i haven't, either. but you will. the morons who write the books should do a little research here.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{but isn't fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{when doesn't he have bronchitis? i wouldn't call his bronchial infections "underdeveloped." would you?}
<A>__{larch plucks fuzzy from in front of the phonograph and zips him into the breathing tent. fuzzy smiles. as larch leaves, mary agnes, a pretty but tough looking teenager, comes into the dispensary.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{what is it, mary agnes?}
<A>__{mary agnes smiles at homer; then she sticks her tongue out at him. homer looks at her impassively, but as the moment continues his expression suggests his annoyance. fuzzy starts to cough; he wheezes as he breathes. homer leans down; he peers at fuzzy through a hole by the zipper of the tent.}
<C>__{mary agnes}
<P>__{(garbled because of her tongue)}
<D>__{look!}
<A>__{homer examines mary agnes' tongue.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{did you bite it?}
<C>__{mary agnes}
<D>__{i don't remember.}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(dismissively)}
<D>__{it looks like you bit it it'll be all right.}
<C>__{mary agnes}
<D>__{maybe i was kissing someone and he bit me.}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(looks at her tongue again)}
<D>__{no, you did it yourself. maybe in your sleep.}
<C>__{mary agnes}
<D>__{i must have been dreaming of kissing someone.}
<A>__{homer is not responding to her come on. he wheels fuzzy into the hall.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{story time, fuzzy!}
