<A>__{donna comes out of the house with a tray of lemonade. the men are sitting by the pool in a pair of webbed aluminum chairs.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well, look at this.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{you bring trunks, jack?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{trunks?}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{swimming trunks.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh. no. strictly dryland.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{too bad. you could use some sun. really.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{maybe next time.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{we have some lotion.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{just the same.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{suit yourself.}
<A>__{donna returns to the house. frank takes a sip of his lemonade and scans his surroundings complacently.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{nice, huh?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{the trees. the flowers. nice.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{terrific.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(expansively)}
<D>__{yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. after the rains. look good as new.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you ask me out here to sell me your house, frank?}
<A>__{frank shakes the ice in his glass.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i don't know what you mean.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the hell you don't.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i told you. something came up. some political dinner or something.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{bullshit. fifteen years, frank. no one paid us off.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it wasn't like that.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what was it like?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{hey pal, i got a mortgage, all right? i got two kids. i got a wife. besides, he made the deal. there's no shame in it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that how you see it?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah, that's how i see it.}
<A>__{jack shakes his head in disgust.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and don't go shaking your head, little brother. i'm not the one who walks in every night smelling like he's got a day job in a piss factory.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it killed him, you know.}
<A>__{jack glances up. dangerous territory.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{a gust of wind killed him.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah, and what put him up there?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hey, you weren't there. right?}
<A>__{jack's look ends this. frank sighs.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{look, can we forget last night? we gotta talk.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{talk.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i been thinking maybe we should make some changes.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sure, why not.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's just an idea. i want your opinion. i mean, we go halfway on everything, right?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's more like 40 60, wouldn't you say?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we agreed that if i took care of the business; i'd be entitled to the extra. isn't that what we agreed?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that's what we agreed.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{if you're unhappy with the arrangement }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm not unhappy.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{if you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, i'd be glad }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{frank. fuck it. okay?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i've tried to do well by you, jack. by both of us.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm grateful, frank. how much? for the singer.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i thought maybe twenty percent. look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead. the big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. we have to stay competitive, jack.}
<A>__{jack laughs coldly.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you, frank. all these years you been telling me we're different. we got novelty, jack. no one can touch us.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{two pianos isn't enough anymore, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it never was.}
<B>__{young woman}
<A>__{in pink sweater and a short black skirt stands in the center of a tiny room in the back of willie's piano showroom, holding some sheet music. sammy davis jr.'s face is on the sheet music. frank is sitting against the opposite wall, a notepad in his hand. jack is at the piano.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{good morning, miss...?}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{moran. monica moran.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{all right, miss moran}
<C>__{monica }
<D>__{actually, that's my stage name.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i'm sorry?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{moran. monica. the whole thing. it's my stage name. my real name's blanche.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{blanche.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{no romance, right? that's why i came up with monica. it's what i prefer.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well, that's fine }
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{but if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for blanche. if you ask for monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{and if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. she's opposed to my career.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{uh huh. well, miss moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{candy man.'}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{is that all right?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's one of jack's favorites.}
<A>__{monica turns and, seeing jack at the piano, gives a little start.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{oops. i almost forgot you were there. here's the music.}
<A>__{monica begins to hand jack the sheet music.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{uh... he knows it.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{really? isn't that a coincidence.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{small world.}
<A>__{monica smiles. she likes jack.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well, shall we?}
<A>__{probably not, but jack begins to play anyway, laconically picking out the cheery tune while monica swings her arms and taps her foot. despite all this, monica still manages to come in between beats and jack has to scramble over a chord to catch her, sort of like a fireman with a net.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{who can take a sunrise sprinkle it with dew toss it in the air and make a groovy lemon pie the candy man can the candy man can...,}
<A>__{there would appear to be ample evidence as to why the mother of monica nee blanche opposes her daughter's career.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{thank you, miss moran, that's enough.}
<A>__{monicals eyes are closed now and she is fully caught up. frank looks over at jack. jack shrugs and continues to play.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{miss moran ... miss moran ... blanche!}
<A>__{monica's eyes pop open.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{oh, sorry. i get so caught up in it sometimes. it's scary.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yes, it is.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{well ... thanks.}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{bye.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{drive carefully.}
<A>__{as monica exits, jack and frank glance at one another and thus begins a seemingly endless parade of aspiring singers who can't sing. as frank sinks lower in his chair and jack's ashtray spills over with wounded cigarettes, singer after singer, in all shapes, sizes, and colors, come forth to offer their own unique interpretations of "feelings," "i gotta be me," "this is my song," and perhaps most appropriately, "what kind of fool am i." finally, when it is all over, jack and frank are left alone in the tiny room, looking dazed, exhausted, and mildly homicidal.}
<B>__{tall young woman}
<A>__{as the sequence ends, a tall young woman in high heels walks into willie's. she glances around, then spots willie across the room, eating a corn beef on rye.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{hey. you one of the fabulous baker boys?}
<B>__{jack and frank}
<A>__{are putting on their coats, preparing to leave. frank is staring at his notepad.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{thirty seven. thirty seven.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{thirty seven girls. and not one who can carry a tune. that must be statistically impossible.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it was a somewhat extraordinary day.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i just don't understand. you would think someone ... anyone ...}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{damn!}
<A>__{the woman in high heels stumbles into the doorway, holding a shoe in her hand. it's broken.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{brand new thursday. you believe it?}
<A>__{after today, jack and frank are prepared to believe anything.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{this where the auditions are?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{this is where the auditions were.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we're finished.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{what about me?}
<A>__{frank looks at his watch.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you're an hour and a half late.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{my watch is broken, too.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{punctuality. first rule of show business.}
<A>__{the woman looks around her.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{this is show business?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(in no mood)}
<D>__{look, miss. we're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(touching her lip)}
<D>__{just like that, huh? you're not even gonna give me a chance?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{don't take it personally.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{how should i take it?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{impersonally.}
<A>__{frank begins to leave.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i don't believe it. i come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because i have gum on my lip and i'm a few minutes late.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you're an hour and a half late.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{so if i'm so 'late how come you're still here?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we ran long.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{so run a little longer.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{miss }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you find a girl?}
<A>__{jack and frank glance at each other.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{so. i'm here, you're here, the piano's here. what d'ya say?}
<A>__{before frank can answer, jack walks over to the piano.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{terrific. thirty eight.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{what's that mean? thirty eight.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't worry about it.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(to frank)}
<D>__{you know, i'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(appealing)}
<D>__{jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{let's get it over with.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{all right. what's your name?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{susie. susie diamond.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{catchy. you have any previous entertainment experience, miss diamond?}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{well ... for the last four years i've been on call to triple a escort service.}
<A>__{jack and frank exchange a glance.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hey, it's legit. strictly dinner and dance.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay. i think that's all we need to know.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{i sing now?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's the premise.}
<A>__{susie gives frank a dark look, then turns to jack.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{i get along without you.' slowly, okay?}
<A>__{jack nods and begins to play. frank slouches down in his chair, preparing to be tortured again.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing; singing)}
<D>__{i get along without you very well of course i do except when soft rains fall and drip from leaves, then i recall the thrill of being sheltered in your arms of course i do but i get along without you very well.'}
<A>__{susie stops. frank just sits there. jack just sits there. she can sing.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(blinking)}
<D>__{uh ... we'll let you know.}
<A>__{jack looks over at frank like he's insane.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{when we know.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{don't leave a girl hanging. second rule of show business.}
<A>__{frank's not amused.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{yeah, well, okay. 'bye, bakers.}
<A>__{susie walks out barefoot.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what are you, crazy?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i just thought we should talk about it. between ourselves.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what's there to talk about? she can sing. that puts her at the head of the class. that makes her the only one in the class.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i don't know ... she had gum on her lip, for christ sake. i don't think she's right for the act.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(studying him)}
<D>__{you're getting cold feet about this.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i was just thinking what ma would think.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ma? ma? was ma there the last time we played the ambassador? oh, that's right, she was on bass. how could i forget.}
<A>__{frank frowns and looks down at his hands.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{how many other silent partners are there, frank? donna? little cindy? hell, let's give eddie a vote.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay, okay. i will call the girl.}
<A>__{frank gets up wearily, then glances down at the notepad.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i didn't get her number.}
