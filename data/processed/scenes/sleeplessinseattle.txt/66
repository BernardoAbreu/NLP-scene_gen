<A>__{as annie starts to run down the street. closeup of: annie, running and now we widen out to see a misty highway she's running down. past a sign saying: seattle approximately 3,000 miles. past another sign: your nerves are shot. and another: your feet are cold. and another: will you find love. and another: before you're cold? and another: burma shave. and annie continues to run, and now we see she's running across a map of the united states it's a little like the one we saw in the beginning of the movie it's like the famous map of the united states by saul steinberg, but instead of being about new york, this one is about seattle. in the distance, at the very edge of the map, we see two indistinct figures a map and a young boy. they start to wave at her, very slowly. annie's eyes widen.}
