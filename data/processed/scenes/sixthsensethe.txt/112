<L>__{interior antique store day}
<A>__{anna moves to the back desk where sean comes out. he's carrying an antique bench in his arms. he places it down and takes a much needed seat.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{you don't need someone with a masters. you need a wrestler guy whose neck is larger than his head.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i need a wrestler with a masters.}
<A>__{anna fills out the paperwork for the ring.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{what's this?}
<A>__{anna looks over to find sean standing at his desk where a birthday present sits on his tabletop. sean looks at her.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{from you?}
<A>__{anna nods, "yes."}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{is it wrestling tights?}
<A>__{anna smiles as she moves to his desk. sean begins to tear off the wrapping paper like a kid at christmas. anna laughs. sean holds up a weathered hardback copy of "the great gatsby." beat.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's a first edition.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{wow, this is too much. it's perfect, anna.}
<A>__{sean puts down the book and hugs her. he pulls back a little, still holding her. they smile at each other. beat. the moment goes on just that crucial fraction of a second too long. their smiles slowly melt away as they continue to hold each other. nothing happens for the longest time. crash! a shattering door slam echoes through the store. anna and jeffery pull apart. they rush past the young man and the young woman to the front of the store. they find the glass front door cracked in a spider web pattern. they carefully push open the door and step out onto the sidewalk. look around. no one in sight. anna stares down the empty street. a concerned expression on her face.}
