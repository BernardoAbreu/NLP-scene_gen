<A>__{peter in his car. ahead, he see two girls at a bus stop. we see peter take a long bladed knife and carefully conceal it under his right thigh. the two girls are wearing backpacks. 'festival of love' stickers decorate the bags. peter pulls his nondescript sedan up to them and says something. they giggle, shake their heads. he laughs, holds up his hands to level of his shoulders in a ' not guilty !' gesture, then makes a peace sign. the girls giggle again, but do not get in. peter drives off.}
