<L>__{interior truck. day.}
<A>__{the prongs of a hammer on a box of grenades. vitaly is prying open the lid. andre jnr. appears behind him m60 poised ominously on his hip.}
<C>__{andre jnr.}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{vitaly}
<D>__{something for yuri.}
<C>__{andre jnr.}
<D>__{step away slowly.}
<A>__{vitaly closes the lid a ruse. he picks up the hammer and in one sudden, violent motion swings it across andre's face, smashing his jaw, teeth flying, andre's body flopping like a rag doll. vitaly grabs two grenades from the box, pulls the pin from one and bowls it into the truck. he runs. the truck explodes in a fireball instantly incinerating andre jnr. yuri's head whips around. the rebel leader's head whips around.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{vit!!}
<A>__{vitaly dashes for the second truck. the rebel leader opens fire, raking vitaly with machine gun fire still trying to run with legs torn to shreds.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{no!!}
<A>__{a second hail of gunfire all rebels firing. vitaly's legs betray him. he collapses to the ground in a pile of blood and dust. we focus on vitaly's still face he has taken enough bullets to kill him three times over. but he is not quite dead. agonizingly slow, he raises the grenade hand to his mouth pulls the pin with his teeth. close on vitaly's hand, trying to summon the strength to throw the grenade. a hand appears, grasps vitaly's hand gently but firmly removing the grenade.}
<B>__{yuri.}
<A>__{the rebels keep their guns trained on yuri, unsure where his loyalties lie. yuri holds the fate of the camp in his hands he could still toss the grenade, destroy the second truck, sacrifice his life. yuri stares to his brother and then to the grenade in his hand. he reaches down and delicately takes the pin from between vitaly's lips. the eyes of the brothers meet for the last time. yuri inserts the pin into the grenade, disarming it the life goes from vitaly's eyes forever. yuri removes any last doubt by tossing the disarmed grenade to the rebel leader. yuri walks away from vitaly's dead body and returns to the negotiating table yuri now the living dead. the rebel leader looks to the two trucks one burning, one not. he removes half of the diamonds from the table.}
