<TRANS>__{FADE IN:}
<LOC>__{INT. VICTORIAN ESTATE - 1895 - DAY}
<ACTION>__{CLOSE UP: Ornate antique GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes 2:15. The credits begin to roll. Calligraphy place cards are painstakingly hand-written in preparation for a formal reception. Servants meticulously clean an elaborate crystal chandelier. Hands rapidly shine silver cutlery. Fresh flowers arranged in several enormous vases.}
<LOC>__{INT. KITCHEN - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Kitchen clock strikes 2:15. Poultry plucked. Feathers everywhere. Steaming copper pots boiling over. Platters prepared with decorative garnish. Extravagant tiered cake is lavishly iced. A glob of frosting enters a pair of puckered lips. The perpetrator, a fey, pompous, HEAD VALET, seriously considers the texture and flavor of the icing, then gives the PASTRY CHEF a withering, sour look. The valet, oblivious to the chef's fury, gathers a prepared silver breakfast tray and checks his pocket watch. 2:15.}
<LOC>__{INT. BEDROOM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Antique bedside table clock -- just past 2:15. The valet throws open velvet drapes, sunlight FLOODS the room revealing a figure sleeping soundly in a massive oak framed bed. The valet puts down the tray, pulls back the quilt. The dozing figure gives the valet a deliberate, angry KICK. Flinching infinitesimally, the valet crosses to the closet, selects three suits and holds them up for inspection. From beneath the puffiest of pillows, AN EYE reluctantly opens. A weary arm points decisively to the riding outfit.}
<LOC>__{EXT. ESTATE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The riding outfit is adorned by LEOPOLD, Duke of Albany, a dashing, virile man in his 30's. GALLOPING with great abandon, he expertly leads his horse up hills and over hedges. He sends gardeners shaping the grounds fleeing from his path. In the background, lanterns are being strung throughout the estate. Rugs are beaten out of open windows.}
<LOC>__{INT. HALLWAY - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{Large hallway clock -- 6:15. A pair of boots track a freshly scrubbed floor as Leopold heads carelessly up the stairway. Three steps behind, the valet snaps his fingers signaling the staff to clean up the mess.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{SERIES OF CLOSE UPS}
<ACTION>__{Gaudily framed portraits of somber relations. A bird sits listless in a gilded cage. Hot water is poured into a bath. Carriages begin to arrive. Orchestra leader signals the musicians to play. Guests fill the ballroom in formal attire.}
<LOC>__{INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Leopold stares haughtily into a full length mirror. He wears only dotted linen drawers and a black silk top hat of the period. He flexes slightly. The valet hastily fastens a corset around his mid-section from behind. Leopold eyes his reflection seductively. He becomes bored. He turns to his right. The valet spoons sorbet from a silver saucer into his mouth. He turns back to the mirror to watch himself eat. The valet pats his mouth dry. He affects a pampered STRUT, crossing the room as the valet sprays a mixture of perfume and powder into the air. Leopold thrusts out his arms walking through the mist, turns and saunters back to his favorite place, in front of the mirror. Finally, as if weighing a great decision, Leopold hands his hat to his valet and nods firmly into the mirror.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{CLOSE UP}
<ACTION>__{Fine linen undervest slides over his head. Black twilled worsted trousers pulled up to his waist. The buttoning of his hard, white, roll collar. A cream suede glove stitched in black slides over his hand. A perfect tight bow tie is tied around his neck. An elegant black tuxedo jacket with silk facings and tails to the knees is fitted to his torso. His hair is sleeked with oil and centrally parted. His eyebrows are brushed with a tiny silver comb. His cheeks are pinched. A red silk handkerchief is placed in the bosom of his lapel. Leopold stares into the mirror. The effect is DAZZLING. He raises one eyebrow. Then, in a voice you could pour over a waffle:}
<CHAR>__{LEOPOLD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You dance like a herd of cattle, Miss Fairchild. You are a rare woman who lights up the room... simply by leaving it.}
<ACTION>__{He bows. As he rises, the reflection of Leopold's UNCLE OTTO, a pampered, effectual man in his 60's, appears behind Leopold in the looking glass.}
<CHAR>__{UNCLE OTTO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Tell me Leopold, do you plan to join us downstairs after completing this one-sided flash of wit?}
<CHAR>__{LEOPOLD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I despise affairs of this sort, Uncle Otto. No one really listens to anyone else. If you attempt it, you will see why.}
<CHAR>__{UNCLE OTTO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You judge everything too severely. I wonder what would happen if you were to cast that critical eye inward?}
<CHAR>__{LEOPOLD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You do not wonder at all. You merely ask in order to state your own opinion.}
<CHAR>__{UNCLE OTTO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{Ahh, here it comes.}
<CHAR>__{UNCLE OTTO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Your life does not seem to have any direction. At the age of 25 a man is too young to do anything well. At 35 he is too old. Now is your time to take action. Tell me, what is it you want to DO with your life?}

<ACTION>__{Leopold, stung, takes a moment to compose himself.}
<CHAR>__{LEOPOLD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I am most grateful for your surveillance and for your sympathy. I assure you there is no need for concern. I am as effectual and attentive... as my position allows.}
<CHAR>__{UNCLE OTTO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Life is not position, Leopold. It is action.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(he straightens Leopold's tie)}
<DIAL>__{I will see you downstairs promptly. In the appropriate frame of mind.}
<ACTION>__{He leaves. Leopold stares into the mirror, snaps his fingers. The valet hands him a glass and pours a small shot of brandy. Leopold shoots him a look. The valet fills the glass higher. Leopold drains the glass and heads to the doorway. He hesitates, taking a deep breath and a long pause. Finally...}
<CHAR>__{THE VALET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(grandly)}
<DIAL>__{Go spread joy.}
<ACTION>__{Without looking back, Leopold leaves the room.}
<LOC>__{INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Music fills the air as the creme de la creme of Victorian society gather inside. Leopold holds a prearranged dance card. He looks at the names and finds his first partner is MISS TREE. Leopold looks upward helplessly at an unrelenting God.}
<LOC>__{INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A profoundly self-conscious Leopold dances energetically into frame with MISS TREE, an ancient, elfin, yet amazingly SPRY woman who gapes up at him searchingly, unblinking. Leopold opens his mouth to speak, can think of nothing suitable to say, and clamps his mouth shut. They dance out of frame.}
<LOC>__{INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Leopold dances into frame with CLARA, a BEAUTIFUL girl of}
<LOC>__{19. He glances at her and smiles. She titters, turning away}
<ACTION>__{shyly. They whirl around the dance floor. His smile grows into a broad grin. Caught up in the excitement, Clara beams up at him... happily revealing a mouth full of missing, inky teeth. Leopold, face frozen in a formal smile, dances on.}
<LOC>__{INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Leopold lumbers into frame with MISS FAIRCHILD, a woman of immense girth. With great dignity and extreme difficulty he maneuvers her around the floor, looking everywhere except her enormous bosom.}
<CHAR>__{LEOPOLD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You dance like an angel, Miss Fairchild. You light up the room. I thank you.}
<ACTION>__{Miss Fairchild curtseys heavily. Leopold glances at his card, sees the name Miss Serena Clacket and shudders. He spots a VERY LOVELY WOMAN hidden amongst the guests. She scribbles in a small note pad, occasionally glancing around. Hiding his dance card, he saunters over.}
<CHAR>__{LEOPOLD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Good evening. I do not believe I have had the pleasure.}
<ACTION>__{The young woman stares vacantly at Leopold until she realizes he is addressing her. She puts her pad away.}

<DIAL>__{Really?}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(looking around the room)}
<DIAL>__{Well it's not home but it's much...}

<DIAL>__{Shocking! The TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY.}
<CHAR>__{CARLSON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{LEOPOLD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(smiling seductively)}
<DIAL>__{Truly I would be in your debt. Any admonition would be erased simply by presenting a partner as lovely as yourself.}
<CHAR>__{CARLSON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, no. Really, I...}
<ACTION>__{Leopold stiffly holds out his arm. A beat. Carlson, stuck, takes it WITH HESITATION and is escorted to the dance floor. They dance. ALL but Leopold and Carlson gaily sing "TA-RA-RA- BOOM-DE-AY." Leopold, flushed, looks quite smitten. Carlson, shy at first, eventually smiles brightly.}
<CHAR>__{LEOPOLD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I suppose we really ought to sing along.}
<CHAR>__{CARLSON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(embarrassed)}
<DIAL>__{Oh, golly.}
<ACTION>__{They half sing, half speak the TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY, their emphasis on "BOOM." Laughing giddily, their dancing becomes freer, picking up speed. The room SPINS. Finally:}
<CHAR>__{CARLSON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(breathless)}
<DIAL>__{Thank you for the dance. It was lovely. I hope it wasn't too awful for you.}
<CHAR>__{LEOPOLD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not at all. It was most enlightening.}
<ACTION>__{There is a slight pause. The Grandfather CLOCK strikes midnight.}
<CHAR>__{CARLSON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I really must be going.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{Then firmly)}
<DIAL>__{Goodbye.}
<ACTION>__{Leopold takes a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. He watches Carlson pass through the crowd and out the courtyard door. He surveys the room. After a moment he follows her.}
<LOC>__{EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Leopold makes his way through the manicured garden in the dark. He hears an EERIE METALLIC SOUND. He slows down, brushes back the thicket. The silhouette of a woman is revealed. She is once again writing in her notebook.}
<CHAR>__{LEOPOLD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Miss Carlson?}
<ACTION>__{Carlson spins around quickly, panicked. Leopold STOPS. Partially hidden in the brush, a sleek, oddly shaped, MECHANICAL device. It's door open, lit from within, casting a weird glow.}

<DIAL>__{Good God...}
<CHAR>__{CARLSON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What are you...? You frightened me.}

<DIAL>__{Answer me!}
<CHAR>__{CARLSON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<ACTION>__{His hand comes to rest on a glowing red lever.}
<CHAR>__{CARLSON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, God.}

Half way down she looses a shoe. She hesitates briefly then continues to the dance floor. In the center of the floor, Leopold, looking very distinguished and attractive, dances with a flirtatious young woman. Try as she might, Leopold keeps her at a distance.}

<ACTION>__{The music changes: A LIVELY CHARLESTON. Leopold heaves a sigh of relief and makes his way through the crowd, up the staircase. The dancers become an intricate maze, a dead end at every turn as Kate searches each male face. In the foreground, Leopold is stopped by a woman midway up the stairs. As they chat, Leopold reaches down and picks up the muddy slipper, offering it to her. She turns in a huff, flouncing down the stairs. Simultaneously, in the background, Kate desperately looks for Leopold. Leopold studies the slipper as he makes his way up the stairs. He slows down, hesitates and STOPS. Very slowly he turns around. He becomes very still. TEARS well up in his eyes. The ballroom clock strikes MIDNIGHT. Kate climbs an opposite staircase to get a better view then STOPS. In her heart SHE KNOWS. Slowly she turns. Leopold stands quietly at the bottom of the stairs, gazing up at her. He extends his arm, showing her THE RING. He offers her his hand. The crowd, the room, THE WORLD AROUND THEM, DISAPPEAR. Their eyes lock. As she descends the staircase, THE YEARS MELT AWAY. Kate's short hair grows long, cascading around her shoulders. The fine lines around Leopold's face are gone. They see themselves through each other's eyes, at the moment of youth, when they fell in love. Leopold bends down, places the slipper on Kate's foot. He rises, looks down at his hands and then up at Kate. His hands are caked with mud. She smiles helplessly. Not caring, he wraps his arms tightly around her. MUSIC begins to play, a slow waltz. He nods to her. She takes a deep breath. Her head bobs in rhythm. She begins to count silently. Leopold smiles, counting along.}

Kate stands with Leopold as he establishes a scholarship for studies in physics. The old photograph of Leopold and Albert Einstein changes to include Kate, waving and smiling broadly for the camera. The professional photograph becomes a double portrait. It shows the two in their 70's, sitting regally in matching chairs. They hold hands and smile serenely. Staring directly into the camera, they show off their rings. SLOWLY the scrapbook closes... Kate and Leopold dance, the music swells as they become lost in the crowd. The clock CHIMES. Slowly we...}
