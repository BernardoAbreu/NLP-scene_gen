<A>__{schuyler has the rasta cornered now but he doesn't have the briefcase. both are out of breath. pissing men look wary.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{where is it?}
<C>__{rasta man}
<D>__{got something better.}
<A>__{the rasta men holds out a shiny key on a chain. schuyler narrows his eyes, he's trying not to lose control of his temper.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i realize you're just some bit player, but i'd like you to get a message to your employers. this bullshit is interfering with my work, it's breaking my concentration and i can't allow that to happen }
<A>__{the rasta makes a sad face, sniffles, still dangling the key.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{if i take that stupid key, will you give me back my briefcase and go away?}
<A>__{the rasta nods with a big grin. schuyler steps forward, hand extended. the rasta flings open the door of a stall beside him and hurls the key into the toilet. instinctively, schuyler moves to grab it, reaches into the toilet, pulls out the chain, his hand and sleeve dripping. the key is missing from the end of the chain.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{what the fuck am i doing ?!}
<C>__{rasta man}
<D>__{don' worry, mon, it's a world a shit.}
<A>__{he drops the rasta schtick, speaks with an ivy league accent:}
<C>__{rasta man}
<D>__{so try looking at it through rose colored glasses... here.}
<A>__{he takes off his sunglasses, folds them and tucks them in the pocket of schuyler's suit. then he reaches above him and pulls down the briefcase, which was perched on top of the stall. schuyler grabs it from him, raises his voice:}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i told you, this is over! i quit!}
<C>__{rasta man}
<D>__{they all say that at first.}
<A>__{he gives schuyler a hearty slap on the back and strolls off, humming. schuyler leans against the wall, shaking his head. he puts down his luggage, pulls the sunglasses from his pocket. close on sunglasses there's the image of a tiny gold key embossed on each of the arms. schuyler puts them on, looks around for a moment, catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror he looks silly. he quickly takes them off. as schuyler heads out the door we see him from behind... the rasta has slapped a colorful sign that reads "kick me" on his back.}
