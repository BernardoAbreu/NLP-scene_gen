<L>__{interior dalai lama's private rooms night}
<A>__{we are in the adjacent room, listening, as norbu thundrup tells a bedtime story. golden butter lamps burn before a statue of buddha.}
<C>__{norbu thundrup }
<D>__{one night, not too long ago, an old monk saw a woman in that very same hallway where you ran away.}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{the boy is in bed. the sweeper finishes off his story as the boy wiggles deeper under the covers.}
<C>__{norbu thundrup}
<D>__{she carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. she opened her basket and showed what she had. heads. human heads. only the heads.}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso}
<D>__{is that true or pretend?}
<C>__{norbu thundrup}
<D>__{it is a story, you decide.}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso}
<D>__{pretend.}
<C>__{norbu thundrup}
<D>__{as you say.}
<A>__{the sweeper tucks the boy in as the master of the robe finishes his nightly preparations and with a pat and a smile, the two men leave the room. a mouse steals a bit of tsampa from the offerings placed on the altar before the buddha. tenzin gyatso peeks out from under his covers and looks to see if those curly toed shoes are visible under the partition. they are. the master of the kitchen is still near. tenzin gyatso pulls the golden pocket watch from under the covers. he pries and digs at the back of the watch until he succeeds in popping it open, revealing its miraculous insides. finally, tenzin gyatso's eyelids grow heavy. the camera passes over his face, as his eyes close. the boy begins to speak, mumble, as he falls asleep:}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso}
<D>__{"i be an island for those who seek one, a lamp for light."}
<A>__{we find two scrolls; the first is penden lhamo, the special protectress of the dalai lama. she rides her wild mule through a sea of blood between rows of jagged mountains. pointed fingers and spreading toes, her hair gone crazy, her fangs revealed the details are incredible. a garland of freshly severed heads hangs around her body, snakes hold up her skirt, five skulls form ber crown.}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso }
<D>__{"may i be a bed for all who wish to rest, and a slave for all who want a slave."}
<A>__{beside her, on the second scroll is mahakala. he is the fierce representation of the buddha of compassion. crows fly in the clouds to the left of the terrifying, black, six armed figure. a skull rosary is held in the upper right arm, a trident is held in the left hand. the deity wears a crown of five skulls. he has three eyes. he tramples an elephant. we might have been in a dream, as the camera finally moves back to find the peaceful1 protected face of the young dalai lama. asleep. the camera moves across the mural devoted to the story of the fifth dalai lama. it is a fantasy of green, with mountains and lakes and deities and monsters. we find the statue of seventh dalai lama, sitting on his golden cushion, and we look, deep into the eyes of the thirteenth dalai lama. fantastic. deeper. deeper.}
