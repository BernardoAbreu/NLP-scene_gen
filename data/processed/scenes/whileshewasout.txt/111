<A>__{della watches vinh plough through the brush. the flashlight sweeps and darts with his movements, up ahead of him, up the embankment. vinh pushes through several trees, slips, regains his footing. he plods past the tree. she slips the screwdriver up her sleeve. prays he won't stop. she pulls herself further up the tree. a sudden commotion of swaying branches startles her, followed by a shower of pine needles. her heart stops. a moment later the sound of fluttering wings is followed by the squawking of angry birds. she's disturbed a bird's nest. she sees the silhouette of four large crows as they burst through the branches above and up into the patch of sky between. the crows circle the patch of sky above, like a greek chorus. she looks back down for a sign of vingh. sees nothing. inches along a branch to see better. the light sweeps back and up through the trees into her eye line, disorienting her. she hears footfalls so close by they must be under the tree. her eyes have barely readjusted when she sees him: vinh standing under the tree scanning the area for a sign of her. she stares down at him, frozen, holding her breath. the flashlight illuminates the whole tree, then sweeps away up the embankment. but vinh's seen something. he makes out her footprints under the tree. he leans down to check, then rises, looks up through the branches. their eyes meet. he opens his mouth to shout for chuckie. she leaps down through the branches. lands thud on his back.}

<A>__{vinh topples to the mud, dragging della with him. they roll as he desperately tries to disengage her. the flashlight frantically searches the area for them. della frees the screwdriver she'd stuffed up her sleeve. she drives the screw driver up into the base of vinh's skull. vinh screams. she thrusts and twists the tool. all the while she's tightly wound around him, intertwined, intimate as a lover. she drives the screw driver deeper in until she feels her knuckles dig into his stiff hair. vinh's scream becomes a high keening wail. the screwdriver pierces the base of vinh's skull. it protrudes through his mouth, knocking several teeth out in a stream of blood. his scream cracks into a death rattle as hers begins. they roll downstream. his arms are wrapped in a death grip around her. they roll until they crash full into a tree about two thirds of the way down. she feels his grip loosen and his body slump over hers. he becomes so heavy he almost crushes her underneath as he dies right there on top of her. she's trapped, suffocating underneath him, until she finds the strength to push him off. she crawls out from under his body. pushing him away, sets him off rolling again. she tries to stand up but her legs are unsteady. her head hurts so bad it's about to burst. the world around her shifts into a migraine zone. trails follow trees, rocks, brush. the desire to close her eyes, to close it all out almost overwhelms her. her shoulder aches too and there's a new pain in her arm where vinh bit her. she sees blood has matted her sleeve, and rolls it up to find a nasty bite mark. there's a loud crash. della freezes and moves only her eyes, looks around. it's vinh's body hitting the stream below. where was the light at the edge of the woods? nowhere to be seen now that's for sure. she staggers along the slope, clutching onto tree trunks and roots as she goes. della grabs for a shrub to help her cross a patch of muddy slope. pulls it clean out by the roots. loses her footing, reaches for the roots of an old tree. she pulls herself up. plods once more along the slope, heading upwards in a diagonal through the darkness. she arrives at the top of the slope only to be met by more darkness. but there's a strange calm about her now. like she's reached the eye of a terrible storm.}
<D>__{chuckie (o.s.) (cont'd) della?}
<A>__{when she hears his voice drifting faintly towards her, she almost smiles. she knows he's coming for her and there's nothing she can do about it. della shivers as she sees a surreal tableau ahead: four huge felled trees wrapped in white plastic. their sad stumps are only feet away. it's the funeral parlour of the forest.}
