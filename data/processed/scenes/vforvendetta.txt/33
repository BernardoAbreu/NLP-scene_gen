<L>__{exterior train}
<A>__{deep in the tunnel, a dark figure glides across the rooftops.}
<L>__{interior conductor's cab}
<A>__{the conductor hears something on the roof. he peers up just as v swings down, smashing feet first into the cab.}
<L>__{interior train car}
<A>__{the brakes suddenly lock, throwing bodyguard 2 into prothero.}
<C>__{prothero}
<D>__{get off of me!}
<A>__{a moment later, the lights are cut off and the entire train is plunged into complete darkness.}
<C>__{bodyguard 2}
<D>__{what the fuck is going on?}
<C>__{bodyguard 1}
<D>__{lock the car doors.}
<C>__{prothero}
<D>__{i have a lighter... somewhere...}
<C>__{bodyguard 2}
<D>__{i can't find the lock wait. hey wha }
<A>__{there is a muffled shriek followed by a sharp snap.}
<C>__{bodyguard 1}
<D>__{what's happening }
<A>__{there is another sound, like the leather slap of a boxer pounding a heavy bag, followed by the sound of the heavy bag collapsing onto the floor.}
<C>__{prothero}
<D>__{i found it!}
<A>__{he flicks on the lighter and, in the dim light of its flame, he sees the smiling face.}
<C>__{prothero}
<D>__{oh god.}
<A>__{v sits casually, arms folded, across from prothero. the bodyguards lay dead on the floor.}
<C>__{prothero}

<C>__{prothero}
<D>__{you're making a mistake. i'm nobody }
<A>__{on the floor, he sees the bodyguard's gun. he kills the lighter and dives for it. in the darkness, we hear the struggle. it ends quickly. when the lighter flicks back on, v is holding it and the gun.}

<D>__{oh god, what do you want?}

<D>__{i've come to offer you a choice. commander prothero.}
