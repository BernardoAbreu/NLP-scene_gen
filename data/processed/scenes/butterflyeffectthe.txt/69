<L>__{interior evan's dorm night}
<A>__{evan and heidi, making out, burst through the door and fall on the bed. evan's shirt is unbuttoned and heidi strokes his chest. suddenly heidi stops and sniffs the air.}
<C>__{heidi}
<D>__{smells like sex in here.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{thumper had a busy afternoon.}
<C>__{heidi}
<D>__{you're kidding. he's so... big.}
<A>__{evan drunkenly crosses the room, grabs two beers from the mini fridge.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{charisma and eyeliner go a long way, i guess. wanna beer?}
<A>__{heidi takes one. looks under the bed.}
<C>__{heidi}
<D>__{most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{yeah. i've been keeping journals since i was seven.}
<C>__{heidi}
<P>__{(respectfully)}
<D>__{wow... read something.}
<A>__{evan chugs his beer and sits next to her on the bed and puts his arm around her. very drunk.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{no way, i'd be too embarrassed.}
<A>__{heidi teasingly runs her fingers over his smooth torso.}
<C>__{heidi}
<D>__{then keep drinking, worm boy. you're too uptight.}
<A>__{evan stops short.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{freeze! no "worm boy". no "mr. worm," and no "worm master general!" once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. and i don't want everyone thinking i've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?}
<C>__{heidi}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{deal. now read me something.}
<A>__{heidi hands him a book marked "age 13". he flips it open to a random place and takes the beer from her hand.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(re: her beer)}
<D>__{for courage.}
<A>__{evan takes and finishes her beer and begins reading. as he reads, he seems more and more on the verge of passing out.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{it's like my mind refused to believe what it was seeing. hearing crockett make those awful screams... just writing about it gives me the shivers.}
<A>__{color drains from evan's face as he realizes what he's reading. he looks over at heidi, who kisses him.}
<C>__{heidi}
<D>__{come on, go on...}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{it was like tommy was possessed or something. there was a hate in his eyes that i couldn't really call human.}
<A>__{as evan reads, the world seems to almost imperceptibly vibrate around him like a tuning fork. his voice becomes distant and sounds echo around him like distant memories resurrecting themselves... flash!}
