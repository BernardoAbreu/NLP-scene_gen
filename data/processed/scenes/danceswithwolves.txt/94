<L>__{exterior village outskirts day}
<A>__{dunbar has stopped on the slope leading down to the village, taking it all in. no one has seen him. he can hear human voices drifting up from the camp. stands with a fist coughs lightly against his tunic and the lieutenant moves cisco ahead at a walk.}
<L>__{exterior village day}
<A>__{a woman and her children have come out of the breaks along the river and are marching back to the village when one of the kids sees him. with an ear splitting shriek, the woman grabs up her children and runs screaming for the safety of the village. there's pandemonium amongst the lodges. everyone seems to be running everywhere at once. dunbar pulls cisco to a halt a hundred yards from the first of the conical houses and slides off, taking the girl up in his arms. the people of ten bear's village, realizing now that there is only one white man and that he is carrying someone, are massing with great curiosity on the outskirts of the town. warriors, some of them mounted, have taken the front ranks. the women and children and elderly are standing just behind. initial panic has given way to a steady buzzing as everyone jockeys for a better look. still holding stands with a fist in his arms, dunbar suddenly stops on a familiar face... wind in his hair. he lifts the girl resting in his arms and holds her out... as in offering.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{she's hurt.}
<A>__{the sioux buzz is stronger now. the mounted warriors are getting excited. suddenly, wind in his hair breaks ranks and starts for dunbar at a determined walk. a nasty war club is held tightly in hand. dunbar stands his ground. wind in his hair halts only a few steps in front of dunbar. he barks at the intruder as he takes another step or two.}
<C>__{wind in his hair}
<D>__{you are not welcome here.}
<A>__{another step and he is close enough to touch the white man.}
<C>__{wind in his hair}
<D>__{go away from us...}
<A>__{dunbar doesn't flinch. and wind in his hair's harangue is definitely part bluster. he's very curious about the woman in dunbar's arms and now he peers down at her face. the lieutenant looks down too and in a flash she is torn out of his grasp. holding her in one strong arm, wind in his hair backs a pace or two and shouts once more at the lieutenant.}
<C>__{wind in his hair}
<D>__{go away from us... go now.}
<A>__{he raises his club and shakes it at dunbar. though he doesn't understand the words, dunbar gets the message. as he goes for his horse, wind in his hair marches back to his people with stands with a fist. there is great commotion as the crowd surges in around wind in his hair. with a look of profound disappointment, dunbar walks away on cisco.}
