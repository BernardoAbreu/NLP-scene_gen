<L>__{interior stairs and lobby, radio station day}
<A>__{pandemonium. chaos. people rushing in all directions, many carrying files, boxes, papers, shouting, calling. some of the men in military uniform. the bombing continuous. szpilman fights his way down the stairs. he has a small cut on his forehead and is dabbing it with his handkerchief. he has a dazed look. halfway down the stairs, a young woman, dorota, tugs at his sleeve:}
<C>__{dorota}
<D>__{mr. szpilman.}
<A>__{he turns, to see an extremely pretty young woman gazing adoringly at him while they're jostled and shoved. his eyes light up.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{dorota}
<D>__{i came specially to meet you today. i love your playing, but what a day to choose.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{dorota}
<D>__{my name's dorota, i'm jurek's sister. oh! you're bleeding.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{it's nothing.}
<A>__{jurek pushes in beside them and takes her arm.}
<C>__{jurek}
<D>__{c'mon, dorota, you can write him a fan letter later, this isn't the best time, c'mon.}
<A>__{jurek, pulling dorota, fights his way down the stairs.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{jurek, why have you been hiding her?}
<A>__{and he, too, is carried with the flow into the lobby. debris everywhere. szpilman fights to get to the main door, when another bomb explodes, filling the air with dust and debris, obscuring him and everyone else.}
