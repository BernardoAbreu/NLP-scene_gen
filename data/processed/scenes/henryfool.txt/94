<L>__{exterior junkyard day}
<A>__{simon is back working on the garbage truck. he collects garbage and throws it in the truck as henry, who is just along for the ride, hangs from the side of the truck and pulls the lever whenever simon tells him to.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{so i was a janitor! so what?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{but angus james said he didn't even know you!}
<A>__{henry shrugs and qualifies...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{well, i mean, we weren't like bosom buddies or anything. but we used to talk sometimes. in the elevator. in the morning. he said he liked my ideas. being a janitor's a good job if you're a writer. especially the night shift; all that time to think and develop my ideas.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{do it.}
<A>__{henry pulls the lever and the garbage gets crushed.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{anyway, he hated my poem.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{well, what the hell does he know? he wouldn't know a vital piece of literary art if it came up and bit him in the leg. to hell with him! he's not the only publisher in the world!}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{but nobody likes it.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(smokes)}
<D>__{it's true. a prophet is seldom heeded in his own land. remember that.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{do it.}
<A>__{henry is about to pull the lever again, but sees something in amongst the garbage...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{hey, look, treasure!}
<A>__{henry steps down and leans over into the garbage. simon joins him as he lifts something that is either a ring or a stray piece of machinery.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{brass maybe. some kinda copper.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{it's a ring. jewelry.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i think it's a gasket. a fitting from off of that old refrigerator over there.}
<A>__{henry puts it in his pocket, satisfied and simon jumps on the back of the truck as it turns the corner and rolls away. henry starts to walk off in the opposite direction, but stops when he sees pearl age seven.}
