<L>__{exterior forest dawn}
<A>__{bare as all hell. the trees stripped of their bark and white like ghosts. some torn violently from their roots and felled. stark gray sunlight shafts between the trees, clouded by a creeping fog that obscures the true color of everything. a light snow flutters. the world monochrome, lifeless and cold. a cat prowls across the dead earth. barely recognizable as the domestic breed it might once have been. its fur mangy and rank, body rib thin from starvation. entirely feral. it moves slowly, cautiously. sniffing the air, scanning the forest, alert. trusting nothing of its surroundings. it paces across a leaf strewn clearing, closing stealthily on: a dead man, splayed face down in the earth. his feet bare. face frozen in a grim death mask. a gaping gunshot wound in his head, the dried blood caked around it matting his hair. as the cat moves closer, approaching warily:}
<B>__{p.o.v. from across the clearing}
<A>__{about thirty yards away. someone is watching. waiting. slow, deep breaths, heard through a gasmask respirator.}
<B>__{close on a pair of industrial goggles}
<A>__{the mirrored lenses reflecting the forest clearing, locked onto the cat. the slow, metered breathing continues. the cat slows, but continues pacing toward the corpse. more cautious than ever. it inches forward, sniffing at the body. on the watcher. crouched behind the mangled stump of a felled tree. concealed beneath a camouflaging mesh of leaves, twigs and bracken. a "ghillie suit" of the kind used by snipers. the cat sniffs at the dead man's hand, frozen by death in a grotesquely contorted claw. the animal still unsure. looks around again, checking its surroundings for predators. the watcher moves almost imperceptibly. the leaves covering him rustle ever so slightly as we hear just barely the familiar creaking sound of a bow string being drawn taut. the cat hears it. looks up, alert. staring right at the watcher, but he is too well camouflaged to be seen. an interminable, tense beat is the prey going to flee? finally, the cat turns its attention back to the carcass, nibbling gingerly at the flesh of the man's fingers. the watcher looses the arrow. it sails across the clearing and skewers the cat clean through. it drops to the ground. the watcher stands, shaking off the ghillie suit, revealing him to us for the first time. he wears a weather beaten knee length duster. hooded sweater with more layers beneath that. torn pants and scuffed work boots. everything filthy and battered from years of wear. along with the goggles, his face remains obscured by a disposable paper dust mask and a crudely fashioned fur hat with dangling ear flaps that may once itself have been a cat. around his neck he wears a silver saint christopher pendant hanging from a frayed twine cord. his name is eli. he shoulders the bow and walks across the clearing. crouches beside the dead cat and pulls out the arrow. wipes the blood from the shaft, then reaches down to collect the body. suddenly the cat screeches and flails wildly! eli recoils, falling backward, stunned, as the cat mortally wounded but fighting to the death bites and claws desperately at him. eli struggles violently with the cat, wrestling it to the ground and grabbing up a hunk of fallen branch. he holds the writhing animal down and clubs it until it lays still. he sits back, breathing harder than the dustmask will allow. he yanks it down, revealing the dirty, unshaven face beneath. impossible to tell his age, but certainly not a young man. for a moment he just sits there. then bundles up the dead cat and returns to the mangled tree stump. folds away his ghillie suit into a nearby rucksack which he hauls up onto his back. a canteen dangles from the backpack, a shotgun strapped to its side. eli reaches down for his final possession an old samurai sword in a scabbard which he slings across his back. he gazes up at the sky. a snowflake drifts down and lands on his cheek. he reaches up and brushes it away, leaving a black smear on his face. not snow after all, but some kind of ash.}
<L>__{exterior forest road day}
<A>__{eli emerges from the treeline onto the cracked and ruptured asphalt. lined by more of those ghostly, stripped bare trees. he sniffs the air, breathing it in. checks the road in both directions. deserted. a few yards away is the rusted, burned out chassis of a car. he heads toward it. the car rests half on the road, half in the adjacent ditch. stripped of its tires and engine. in the driver's seat is a mummified body. a bullet hole piercing its forehead. eli regards the body dispassionately. tries the door handle but it's jammed. he yanks on it harder and eventually wrenches it open. he leans in and checks the man's feet. they're bare. no shoes or socks. eli curses under his breath. he leaves the car behind and heads on down the road. as he walks away, we see that the sole of one of his boots has worn loose, held in place now only by a rubber band.}
<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{eli continues down the road. he ambles along slowly, a man in no hurry. a man who has been walking a long time. the road has since emerged from the forest. passing now through a wasteland of dead scrub brush and urban junk. the sun beats down from directly overhead. the sky has no color to it, paper white. the unfiltered sun's stark light leaves everything seeming bleached out, over exposed. crane up as eli walks on. on the horizon is the silhouette of a city. or what was once a city. columns of black smoke rise from within, casting a deathly pall over the skyline. burned and broken skyscrapers jut out like tombstones. eli reaches a fork in the road and stops. the road he's on appears to wind off in the direction of the ruined city on the horizon. the other fork continues on into the wasteland. after a brief pause, eli changes direction and heads off down the other fork, away from the city.}
<L>__{exterior abandoned town day}
<A>__{little more than a main street lined with storefronts. eli walks steadily along, side stepping rubble and debris. ignoring the petrified corpses lying in the street. he passes by abandoned stores, every one picked clean. empty shelves, smashed windows. looted and burned. he doesn't even look inside, knowing already that he will find nothing. until he comes to a store that does cause him to stop. an old fashioned sign squeaks on rusted hinges in the breeze.}
<D>__{ed's shoes gentlemen's and ladies' footwear}
<A>__{he steps into the doorway and pushes open the door. it swings open on its one remaining hinge before splintering away from the frame and crashing to the floor in a cloud of dust.}
<L>__{interior shoe store continuous}
<A>__{eli steps inside. like all the others, the store has been cleaned out. shoe racks and empty boxes strewn over the floor. the whole place reeking of dead, musty air. eli looks around, just to be sure. drags his sheathed sword idly along the empty racks as he checks them. nothing. as he turns back for the door, his foot nudges against a shoe box. it's not empty. he crouches down, flips the lid off hopefully... and pulls out a lady's high heeled shoe. he strokes the shoe leather with his hand. shakes his head grimly, then tosses the shoe back into the box and leaves.}
<L>__{exterior abandoned house day}
<A>__{on the outskirts of town. in disrepair peeling paint, broken windows, damp stained walls but habitable. eli stands in the front yard, surrounded by brownish, overgrown weeds. thinking it over. turns to face the setting sun. it will be dark soon. he turns back toward the house.}
<L>__{interior abandoned house day}
<A>__{the front door is sent crashing open with a hard kick, revealing eli silhouetted in the fading sunlight. the shotgun unhitched from his pack and held ready. he moves inside. another dead place. flies buzzing in the still, dank air. everything covered in a thick layer of dust but otherwise largely preserved. an eerie snapshot of a world long gone.}
<B>__{kitchen}
<A>__{every cupboard empty. eli checks each one, poking around in the dark corners with his sword, but finds nothing but dust. he opens the freezer, checks inside. empty save for a small icebox. the lid stuck fast with mildew and gunk. eli digs at it with his grimy fingernails and manages to pry it open. inside are the wizened, petrified remains of a human hand. floating in slimy, discolored water. the smell vile and thick enough to make eli retch. he quickly jams the lid back on.}
<B>__{bedroom}
<A>__{a wooden bedframe stripped clean. the dresser drawers have been emptied and lie strewn across the floor. eli moves toward a large walk in closet and opens the door. no clothes inside just the near fossilized corpse of a man hanging by a noose. twisting gently back and forth. unfazed, eli crouches down and checks the man's feet. an old pair of converse all stars hang limp from the man's skeletal ankles. eli calmly sets about unlacing them. he checks the size; they're a fit. he upturns each shoe and shakes the old flakes of mummified flesh from them. discards his ruined boots and puts on the sneakers, laces them up. he walks around, pacing up and down, getting a feel for the new shoes. they feel good. for the first time, he smiles.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{eli sits in the corner, roasting the carcass of the dead cat over a small campfire. he cleans the animal's pelts as he watches it cook. pokes at the meat with a pen knife, checking it for done ness. it appears ready to eat. he clasps his hands together in prayer.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{dear lord, thank you for your generosity in providing us today with this bountiful feast.}
<A>__{he speaks quietly, his voice barely above a whisper. even so, we catch the accent a raspy, old world midwest drawl, like john wayne or some other long forgotten western icon.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{thank you for the many gifts that you have given me. thank you for your protection and your guidance. thank you for bringing me this far. i know my long journey's end is near. i ask now only for the strength and the courage to complete the task that you in your infinite wisdom saw fit to bestow upon me over all men. i won't let you down. amen.}
<A>__{he signs a cross over himself, then uses the knife to saw off a chunk of meat. takes a bite, savoring the taste with great relish. to him, it's grade a filet mignon.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{hey. you hungry?}
<A>__{it appears as though he is talking to himself... until a rat emerges from his coat pocket, whiskers twitching keenly. eli offers it some meat. the rat gnaws enthusiastically at it.}
<B>__{sundown}
<A>__{the last of the waning sunlight shafts through the bedroom's broken window. eli rummages through his backpack, pulls out a small package wrapped in cloth and tied fast with string. he sits back in his corner and carefully unwraps it. it's an old leather bound book. the binding cracked and pages dog eared, thumbed through a thousand times and more. eli gazes lovingly at it. lets his fingers play across the beat up old leather cover. a cherished thing. he begins to read, half hidden in the shadows of the fading sunlight. silently mouthing the words as he reads them.}
<B>__{many pages later}
<A>__{eli closes the book and parcels it back up as before. replaces it in his pack, then reaches in for something else. a car battery. old and streaked with acid stains. attached to a tangled bunch of electrical wiring and jumper cables. eli reaches into his pocket and produces: an ipod. badly beat up, the case pretty much held together with duct tape. but functional. eli attaches the battery cable to the ipod and places the headphones in his ears. the music plays. mozart's piano concerto no. 20 in d minor. eli rests back against the wall and pushes the volume way up. the music swells. eli's fingers dance and swoop in the air, as though conducting an orchestra, as he is transported by the music to another world, a world far from this one.}
<B>__{morning}
<A>__{sunlight shafts through the window. eli sits slumped in the exact same position, headphones still in his ears. asleep. the rat scurries up eli's chest and licks his face. slowly, he wakes, realizing he fell asleep with his music still on. checks the battery. it's dead, drained overnight. he frowns. he gets to his feet, moves to the window and checks outside. all seems quiet. he loads up his backpack and weapons.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{come on now.}
<A>__{the rat scurries up his leg, onto his duster and disappears into the breast pocket. eli turns and moves out.}
<L>__{exterior abandoned house morning}
<A>__{the gate squeaks shut behind eli as he exits the front yard. he breathes in the air, turns to feel the warm morning sun on his face. then turns away from it and walks on down the road.}
<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{the landscape barren and featureless, road lined with dead trees. eli walks along the warped and broken asphalt. the road is strewn with burned out cars and debris from a world long dead. a warped metal sign by the side of the road reads: litter removal next two miles by: "circuit city". up ahead is a hunched figure by the side of the road. eli arrives to see that it's a young woman. bone thin, dressed in filthy rags. skin plagued by an unpleasant rash. the shopping cart she was pushing has overturned into a roadside ditch, spilling its contents. blankets, tins of food, old clothes. she's on her knees trying to gather it up. she looks up as she sees eli approaching. instantly cowers from him, raising her hands to protect herself. terrified.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{oh. please don't hurt me. here, take anything you want. you want some food? take it.}
<A>__{she offers him a can of pet food with a trembling hand. eli stands there looking at her. his expression impossible to read behind the mirrored goggles.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm not going to hurt you.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{that's what the last guys said.}
<A>__{eli bends down and picks up a couple of the cart's spilled contents. steps forward and offers them to her.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{she blinks. unsure. cautiously she reaches out and takes it.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{could you help me? the wheel came off. i can't fix it. maybe if i could get it out of the ditch. but i can't.}
<A>__{eli looks at the cart. it has come to rest in the ditch just inches from a thick bracken hedgerow that lines the road. he looks again at the girl. her faded blouse is unbuttoned, revealing a little cleavage. her skirt torn along the leg, showing more than a little thigh. almost deliberate. he sniffs the air. watches the hedgerow warily. just like the cat he hunted, his senses heightened and on alert. behind the hedge, three roadside bandits are crouched, waiting to pounce. each armed with a crude blunt weapon. they exchange anxious looks. eli sniffs the air again then backs away from the girl.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{one good thing about no soap any more. you can smell the road agents a mile off.}
<A>__{the girl's face falls as eli backs up. the three bandits emerge from the hedgerow, brandishing their weapons. a couple of them wear old sunglasses and goggles similar to eli's. the bandit leader grabs the girl by a fistful of hair as he passes, yanking her painfully to her feet.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{dumb bitch. what did we tell you?}
<A>__{he pushes her away, she crumples to the road in a heap. eli backs away, but two more armed bandits drop from hiding in the trees behind, cutting off his escape, surrounding him.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{what you got there in the pack?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{yeah, that's what they all say. how about you take it off real slow and tip it out so's we can take a look?}
<A>__{bandit #2 notices the shotgun strapped to the pack.}
<D>__{bandit #2 he's got a gun.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{shit, it ain't loaded. they never are. ain't that right, old man?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{open the fucking pack or die.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i can't do that.}
<A>__{the bandit leader steps forward aggressively. now within striking distance of eli. he grins, teeth filthy and rotten.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{want us to do it for you? we can get it off real easy after we've hacked your fucking arms off.}
<A>__{eli remains perfectly calm. and though he speaks with a soft, even tone, there is something formidable about his voice.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's real important you boys listen to me and understand. the man i work for, you do not want to cross him. see, i'm under his protection. you stand in my way, you stand in his. and he will cut you down with a righteous fury through me. for i am his faithful instrument.}
<A>__{beat. the bandit leader looks at eli incredulously... and then laughs. the other bandits laugh along nervously.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{what the hell are you, some kinda preacher?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{something like that.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{well i got news for you, preacher man. whatever kinda god you reckon yourself to be working for, he left these parts a long time ago. he ain't here to protect your ass. now take off the pack and set it on the ground.}
<A>__{eli doesn't move, doesn't say a word. the bandit leader takes another step forward and shoves him in the shoulder.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{you fucking listening to me?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i hear you. you lay that hand on me again and you will not get it back.}
<A>__{the other bandits exchange nervous looks. this is not how it's supposed to go.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{all right, i had just about enough of this shit...}
<A>__{he lunges forward, grabs the shoulder strap of eli's pack. if you blinked, you missed it. but somehow eli has now drawn his sword. a rivulet of blood snakes down along the blade and drips onto the asphalt. bandit leader's hand is still gripped firmly around eli's shoulder strap. but it's no longer connected to his arm. the severed hand hangs there from the strap, dripping blood. bandit leader staggers backward and raises the bloody stump where his hand once was. looks at it in shock and horror.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{what... you just... he just cut my fucking hand off! my fucking hand!}
<A>__{eli pries the hand loose from the strap and tosses it onto the road as bandit leader's legs give out and he slumps to the asphalt. his eyes dart around, as though confused.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{what you standin' around for? kiss him! bandit #3 what's he talkin' about, kiss him?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{he's in shock. he means "kill him".}
<A>__{a tense beat. and then the four remaining bandits attack eli all at once, weapons flailing. eli flourishes the sword. a blur, too fast to follow. but it's clear he is possessed of an inhuman level of skill. it is over in moments. the four bandits lay slain in the road, blood pooling out onto the asphalt. the bandit leader crawls toward his severed hand, a few yards away. eli steps in and kicks it out of his reach.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i told you you wouldn't be getting that back.}
<A>__{bandit leader looks up to see the figure of eli bearing down on him, silhouetted ominously against the sun. he looks for a moment like an avenging angel, something not of this world.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{my name is eli.}
<A>__{and with that, eli runs him through with his sword. he turns to see the young woman slumped in the road, sobbing. she cowers again as he approaches, certain that she is nexterior he walks past her. sheathes his sword, then pulls out the shopping cart from the ditch and rights it. the woman watches incredulously as he gathers up her supplies into the cart.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{take it and go on your way. and don't fall in with men like these again. no good can come.}
<A>__{she looks at him, puzzled.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{why are you doing this?}
<A>__{eli says nothing. walks back to the slain bandits, crouches beside them and begins searching their bodies. he takes a scarf from around the neck of one. finds a zippo lighter on another, checks that it works and pockets it.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{the five bodies are lined neatly in the ditch, half covered with dirt. the best burial they are going to get. eli stands before them, head bowed in prayer. he speaks quietly and quickly, a speech he has given many times.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{god, the father of mercies, through the death and resurrection of his son has reconciled the world to himself and sent the holy spirit among us for the forgiveness of sins.}
<A>__{the young woman stands a few yards away, watching him, transfixed. she has never seen anyone like him.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{through the ministry of the church may he give you pardon and peace, and i absolve you from your sins in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy spirit. amen.}
<A>__{he turns and walks away down the road, passing the woman.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{thank you. you're... a good man.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{there are no good men on the road.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{west.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{can... can i come with you?}
<A>__{he doesn't even turn back to look at her.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{he walks on, into the horizon.}
<L>__{exterior freeway overpass day}
<A>__{straddling the desert like a giant, crumbling monument to a long dead civilization. eli steadily climbs his way up. he comes to an abrupt stop as we realize suddenly that the overpass has collapsed at mid pointerior rusted iron rods jut out from where the roadway has been severed. eli just stands there at the edge for a moment, feeling the wind whip around him, his coat fluttering in the breeze. the overpass's collapsed section is now just a mountainous pile of rubble that leads down to the road below. eli steps onto the rubble. about to make his way down when he freezes. he hears something. the faintest of sounds. he takes cover, peering down at the road beneath the overpass to see: two people walking together on the road. we see everything from eli's p.o.v. too far to make out much detail, but apparently it is a middle aged couple. the man pushes along an old wheelbarrow covered by a tarp as the woman, seemingly his wife, walks alongside. the barrow's rusted wheel gives out a plaintive, rhythmic squeak. eli ducks down again as he hears something else. this time much louder. the menacing growl of motorcycle engines. four bikes in total. riding out of the horizon, closing in on the couple. they see the bikes coming and panic. try desperately to steer the barrow off the road. the bikes screech to a halt and the four riders dismount. brandishing a variety of weapons. the couple make a run for it but they're quickly chased down and tackled to the ground. the woman screams and struggles helplessly as the bikers swarm over the man like a pack of predatory animals. the woman is pulled to the ground and the clothes stripped from her. eli turns away. he knows what comes nexterior eli listens as the woman screams and screams. he reaches for his shotgun... hesitates... then withdraws his hand.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it ain't your concern. stay on the path. it ain't your concern. stay on the path.}
<A>__{eli repeats it like a mantra. he clearly wants to intervene, but will not permit himself to. instead, he simply sits and waits grimly as the woman continues to scream for help. and then finally, suddenly, is silenced. down below, the bodies of the man and woman lay dead and bloodied in the dirt. the bikers tear the tarp from the wheelbarrow, spilling its contents onto the asphalt. they ferret through the items, scavenging a few items we don't see what and stuffing them into an old cloth satchel. they leave the rest strewn in the road and ride off in the direction they came, dust pluming in their wake. eli waits until the sound of the motorcycles has receded into the far distance before emerging from his hiding place.}
<L>__{exterior road beneath overpass day}
<A>__{eli crouches on one knee before the murdered couple. he signs a cross over their ravaged bodies as he mutters a prayer under his breath. then stands and continues on down the road.}
<L>__{exterior road fork day}
<A>__{more desolate wasteland as far as the eye can see. the road forks again here. eli arrives at the junction and stops. the road eli is on leads further into the west. the other fork heads toward a small town just visible on the horizon. a hand painted sign has been driven into the dirt nearby. no words, just a series of crude pictograms. a bed. a plate of food. a water faucet. an arrow points toward the town. eli pauses, thinking it over. retrieves the ipod from his pocket. clicks the button, but no response. he sighs. he turns and heads down the other fork, toward town.}
<L>__{exterior desert town outskirts day}
<A>__{a primitive, sprawling village of tents and barn like structures. built from corrugated iron, rotted wood, molded plastic, tarpaulin materials scavenged from the old world. huddled residents are dressed in little more than rags, many wearing goggles like eli's to shield their eyes from the sun. eli stands at the edge of town. reluctant to enter, but he braces himself and walks on in. and as he rounds a corner, entering the center of town, an astonishing sight:}
<L>__{exterior desert town main street continuous}
<A>__{the broad thoroughfare now all that remains of whatever town once stood here. many of the old storefronts still largely intact but patched up with salvaged materials. the asphalt street warped and cracked, parking meters bent and smashed. it's a lot like the abandoned town eli passed through earlier, except very much alive bustling with townsfolk. it's at once a familiar and also a disturbing sight like an old norman rockwell painting of classic small town america, but filtered through the devastating eye of an apocalypse. an unsettling juxtaposition of the old world and the new. the centerpiece of the town is a grand theater at the head of the main street. the palladium. like the rest of the town, badly damaged and shoddily fixed up. but still standing. eli walks down the street and approaches a blacksmith, hammering out a metal plate over an anvil outside his store.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you got an engineer or a fuelman around here?}
<A>__{the blacksmith doesn't look up from his work but motions toward a storefront at the far end of the street.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{eli heads down the street. stopping when he comes across a statue erected in the center of the road. a tall man crudely fashioned in clay. one hand placed paternally on the head of a small child, the other outstretched toward the sun. as he observes the statue, eli notices that passing residents take a moment to pause and genuflect before it. worshipping. curious, eli reaches up and runs his hand over the statue's face. then hears shuffling feet behind him and turns as a parade of emaciated men and women trudges past. roped together at the waist, each man leading the one behind. heads shaved, thin from malnutrition. and each one blind. they gaze at the ground with pale, dead eyes. they carry picks, shovels and other tools a sightless chain gang. eli watches as the pathetic parade shuffles past, herded like cattle by a brutish chain gang boss who swats at them with a stick to keep them moving and indicate direction.}
<C>__{chain gang boss}
<D>__{come on, move it!}
<A>__{the gang boss glares at eli as he passes by. eli doesn't return the look, just continues crossing the street as the blind are herded away. headed toward a wooden building with a pictogram of a lightning bolt suspended above the door.}
<L>__{interior engineer workshop continuous}
<A>__{whatever this place once was, it's now a kind of post apocalyptic radio shack. shelves display a variety of goods. engine parts. old electrical wiring. small appliances. an old electric generator rumbles noisily, powering strings of multi colored christmas lights that hang all around. behind the main counter a convoluted rube goldberg esque still is running. an engineer in a leather apron pours the remnants of a can of motor oil into the still's funnel. attached to the still is an old motorcycle mirror. in its reflection the engineer sees eli checking out the store. without turning around, he reaches surreptitiously behind the counter for something. eli turns toward the counter to find the engineer training a pump action shotgun right at him.}

<D>__{no. i will set it down. okay?}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{slowly!}
<A>__{eli nods. unhitches the pack and sets it down, steps away.}

<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i forgot. i've been on the road a long time.}

<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm not one of them.}
<A>__{the sight of the steady hand seems to reassure the engineer a little. finally, he lowers the shotgun.}

<L>__{interior palladium auditorium day}
<A>__{this once grand theater have been largely gutted seats torn out, fixtures and fittings stripped, curtains ripped from the stage. but still, there's a sense of grandeur to this place. looking out over the stage, a royal box once the most prestigious seat in the house has been converted into an office of sorts. seats removed and replaced by an ornate mahogany desk facing inward, a chandelier suspended above it. the whole set up is gaudy and ostentatious the work of someone who wants to project an aura of power and wealth, but has no taste whatsoever. a tall man is seated in a battered leather armchair behind the desk, deeply involved in an old paperback book. the book's cover is faded and partially torn away, the title still just visible: 7 habits of highly effective people. the man is older than most we've seen. his skin weathered by the elements and by a long life's experience. one of the very few people we've seen in this world close to eli's age and unlike everyone else we've seen, he appears healthy and well groomed. a rich mane of hair, full set of teeth. he wears a tattered suit and tie. none of it matches, everything scavenged from different outfits and eras. but he looks almost civilized. respectable. his name is carnegie. he looks up from his book at the sound of a polite cough o.s. redridge stands before him. tall, powerfully built.}

<D>__{how long?}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{hard to say. six months, maybe. a little longer if we're careful. but we're already }

<D>__{halve the rations.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{we just halved `em last }
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{so halve them again!}
<A>__{beat. carnegie stares redridge down. nobody but nobody questions his orders.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{you're going to have to say something. folks were none too happy last time. gonna be worse now, you can count on it.}
<A>__{carnegie sighs, rubs his brow. he knows redridge is right.}
<L>__{exterior desert town main street day}
<A>__{a large crowd of townsfolk several hundred strong has assembled outside the palladium theater. an armed crew of carnegie's goons keeps watch over the crowd. carnegie stands on a balcony above the theater marquee. he treats the balcony like a pulpit, speaking through a microphone connected to an old pa system that carries his words to the far reaches of the crowd.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{i want you all to remember how far we've come together. and how far we still can go, if only we believe. when i brought us here to this oasis this promised land we knew there would be hardships. knew there would be sacrifices. but we also knew that we were creating for ourselves a world where we could be safe from the horrors of the forsaken lands beyond our borders.}
<A>__{the crowd listens intently, hanging on carnegie's every word. he is an incredibly charismatic and persuasive speaker his cultivated image and inspiring, confident delivery remind us of a television evangelist.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{and i want you all to remember above all that it is not the water with which we have been blessed that is the true lifeblood of this town... but faith.}
<A>__{this sends a murmur of discontent through the crowd. many don't like where they suspect this may be going. carnegie senses this and dials up his rhetoric delivering it now with the fire brand passion of an old time baptist preacher.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{it is our faith that sustains us, brothers and sisters! hallelujah!}
<A>__{the crowd is divided. many return the "hallelujah" with varying levels of conviction. others are not convinced. but carnegie continues unabated, selling it harder than ever.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{and mark me, the ultimate validation of that faith is coming! the sacred word of our lord that formed the world before and will reform it once again is coming to this town to bring it succor, bring it nourishment, bring it new life! for the almighty himself has spoken unto me and promised it!}
<A>__{carnegie is such an impassioned and inspiring speaker it's almost impossible not to get caught up and swept away by his words. his apparently unshakable belief is infectious.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{in the meantime, he has asked us all to be patient. to walk the hard road of the faithful just a little longer. and to do that, we must give just a little more.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{water rations will be halved until further notice.}
<A>__{this sends a much broader ripple of discontent through the crowd this news has not been received well at all. some still "keep the faith" but many more are perturbed by this. carnegie motions for the crowd to settle down.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{i understand your frustration. the road to salvation is a difficult one but what lies at the end of that road is a greater glory, beyond anything you can imagine.}
<A>__{a discontented villager steps forward, pushing through the crowd and jabbing his finger angrily up at carnegie.}
<C>__{discontented villager}
<D>__{we've heard this all before! when are you going to }
<A>__{carnegie's goons quickly move in and efficiently silence the man, removing him from the crowd. dissent is not tolerated here. carnegie goes on speaking as if nothing had happened.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{i know each and every one of you will understand the necessity of this action. it was faith that built this town and faith that will sustain it even through the dark times that may lie ahead. but it is always darkest before dawn and the new dawn is coming.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{may god go with you all.}
<A>__{carnegie steps back inside, leaving the crowd to talk among themselves, clearly mixed about what they have heard. as the assembled townsfolk disperse, four motorcycles roar into town and pull up outside the palladium. as the riders dismount, one detaches a cloth satchel from his bike's cargo rack. the four riders head inside. they each have long, straggly hair and brutish expressions. we recognize them now as the biker bandits who killed the couple on the road under the freeway overpass.}
<L>__{interior palladium second floor day}
<A>__{carnegie emerges into the second floor hallway from the balcony, mopping his brow. exhausted and stressed from his grand theatrical display, and from its mixed reception. redridge climbs the stairs to meet him.}

<A>__{carnegie looks at his cracked old wristwatch.}
<C>__{carnegie}

<A>__{what was once a grand, gilded entrance foyer has, like the rest of the theater, been largely gutted. but it's still impressive a spacious bar area with a grand staircase leading up to a second floor, entrance to balcony seats, etc. faded old theater posters still hang from the walls. the place has been shabbily converted into a kind of saloon. old ripped out theater seats arranged around tables. a fireplace sputters dimly. a mangy tabby cat walks across the straw laden floor. a dozen or so customers in the place, a mixed, rough looking bunch. redridge emerges from an upstairs room and nods to a group of his men who are holding the bikers at the foot of the stairs.}
<L>__{interior palladium auditorium carnegie's box}
<A>__{carnegie checks his reflection in a cracked hand mirror, licks his palm and slicks his hair back. he adjusts his tie as redridge's men usher the bikers into his "office". carnegie wheels around and flashes a smile at them. just as when he gave his balcony address, carnegie is in performance mode charismatic and slick like a campaigning politician.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{gentlemen! it's truly a delight to see you again! i understand your latest excursion into the outland has been a profitable one?}
<A>__{the bikers exchange looks. they understood maybe half the words in that sentence. the lead biker named hog speaks.}

<D>__{we did good.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{well, let's see, shall we?}
<A>__{hog tips the satchel's contents out onto carnegie's desk. books. about a dozen different volumes of all shapes and sizes. carnegie rifles excitedly through the collection. we see various titles as he sorts through them. treasure island. the da vinci code. a volume of encyclopedia. the diary of anne frank. tuesdays with morrie. in amongst the books are a few magazines. an old issue of oprah magazine. a torn copy of sports illustrated... ...and a newsweek. the cover graphic illustrates opposing nuclear arsenals over a world globe. on one side the stars and stripes, on the other flags indicating a sino islamic alliance. the headline reads: "is there no turning back?"}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{no. no. no. no. no.}
<A>__{as carnegie rejects each book with growing disappointment and frustration, it's clear he's looking for a specific volume.}

<D>__{it's not here.}
<C>__{hog}
<D>__{these ain't worth nothin'?}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{when you bring me the book i asked you for, it'll be worth something.}
<A>__{the bikers exchange more looks. an unspoken conversation.}
<C>__{hog}
<D>__{we been doin' this a long time now. had to make a whole lotta corpses to bring you all these books. you want us to keep at it, reckon it's worth more than a few free glasses of that swill you call liquor.}
<A>__{carnegie's guards bristle, ready for a confrontation. carnegie just smiles, always ready to smooth things over.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{gentlemen, gentlemen. i urge you once again to take the long view here. when we find this book and believe me, we will find it we are going to build a new world. a world far greater, far more righteous than this one. and you and i are going to be perched right on top of it, looking down upon it, masters of all creation!}
<A>__{as always, his carefully stage managed rhetoric is delivered with the utmost conviction, every word dripping with passion and persuasion. he's a master salesman, a true huckster.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{and you know, i think you're absolutely right.}
<C>__{carnegie }
<D>__{that is worth more than a few glasses of liquor. a whole lot more.}
<A>__{he steps forward and looks hog right in the eye. his gaze like a laser beam, utterly disarming.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{the book i want is out there somewhere, just waiting to be found. once there were millions of copies you only need to find one! find it and bring it here. and i promise you, you will be rewarded beyond anything you can imagine.}
<A>__{it's impossible not to be swayed by this guy. he's just so full of fiery passion and infectious belief, you almost want to reach into your pocket and hand over your wallet. hog snatches up his empty satchel.}
<C>__{hog}
<D>__{this better not be bullshit.}
<A>__{he turns and marches to the door, the other bikers following. the guards escort them out, only redridge remains. carnegie slumps back into his chair, frustrated, pissed off.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{might help if they knew just what they were looking for.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{not one of them can read. how would they even know when they found it?}

<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{two years now you been sending these crews into the outland. burning up gas we can barely spare. for a goddamn book? what the hell kinda book can be worth all this?}
<A>__{carnegie ignores him. stands, walks toward the door. redridge sighs, gestures toward the books piled on carnegie's desk.}

<D>__{what about these?}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{put them with the others.}
<L>__{interior palladium main lobby day}

<L>__{interior engineer workshop day}
<A>__{eli watches as the engineer charges the battery with the gas generator, which chugs noisily. he licks his lips, dry as sand. unscrews his canteen to take a drink, but it's down to its last few drips.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{what's this place across the street? they got any water?}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{we got our own underground spring here. only fresh water in a hundred miles if's you can pay for it.}
<A>__{eli thinks a while longer. then stands and stuffs his shotgun inside his pack, shoulders his gear and makes for the door.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i will be back.}
<A>__{eli stops in the doorway and turns back to the engineer.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{if that battery ain't here when i get back, i will use this gun on your kneecaps and i will put this building to the torch and i will watch it burn to the ground with you alive inside it. so help me god.}

<L>__{interior palladium carnegie's bedroom day}
<A>__{this old second floor dressing room has been converted into a bedroom, simply furnished. a woman stands in front of an old dressing room mirror, the bulbs around the frame burned out and broken. she washes her face in murky water in an old porcelain bowl on the dresser. her name is claudia. early 30s, pretty. she gazes into the mirror as she dries her hands, but it's so cracked and warped it's near impossible to see a reflection. the door opens and carnegie enters. he still looks steamed. claudia doesn't turn to look at him, keeps facing the mirror.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{is that you, honey?}
<A>__{carnegie says nothing. just paces angrily up and down. finally claudia turns to face him.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{something wrong?}

<D>__{more books came in from the road today.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{oh? it's been a while.}

<D>__{and it'll be a while longer. just another pile of useless junk. if we don't find the right one soon if i can't give these people what they want to hear...}
<A>__{carnegie trails off, the thought too awful to contemplate. claudia adopts a sympathetic expression, supportive.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you'll find what you're looking for. it's out there somewhere. you just have to have faith.}
<A>__{this seems to anger carnegie. he wheels on her.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{faith? is that what you think we're missing around here?}
<A>__{she detects the aggressive tone in his voice and goes quiet, head bowed. carnegie moves toward her angrily.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{my old man used to have faith. he had it in spades. my mother, too.}
<C>__{carnegie }
<D>__{you know where it got them? you know where it got me?}
<A>__{he's in her face now. claudia avoids eye contact, submissive.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{faith is for the weak. it's for them out there, the sheep. this world is what you can see and touch and taste. it's what you make it. all these years with me, you still don't have any grasp of that? what's wrong with you, woman?}
<A>__{he's shouting now, and she's trembling, afraid to speak.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{carnegie realizes he's frightened her. he softens.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{no, i'm sorry. i didn't mean to scare you. hey. you okay?}
<A>__{he lifts her chin up, wipes away a tear.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{you just get me all riled up with that kind of talk. it's not what i need from you right now.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{you know what i need right now?}
<A>__{he puts his hands on her lustfully. it's clear she's not in the mood, but she halfheartedly responds anyway. more out of a sense of wifely duty than reciprocated passion. as they kiss, carnegie pushes her excitedly against the wall and feverishly begins unbuckling his pants.}
<L>__{interior palladium main lobby day}
<A>__{the original customers have now been joined by the four bikers, who sit at their own table drinking a clear and pungent moonshine type liquor from a shared jar. eli enters. all eyes are on him immediately, regarding him with guarded interest as he pulls up a stool at the bar. the bartender approaches, looks him up and down. suspicious.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{outlander? let me see }

<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{that's the good stuff. gotta eat into my own ration to sell it so i don't sell it cheap.}

<A>__{the bartender spies eli's silver saint christopher pendant.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{what about that?}
<A>__{eli stuffs the pendant inside his shirt. no way that's for sale. instead, he reaches into his coat and produces the fur pelts he skinned from the dead cat, lays them out on the bar.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{that's the best i got.}
<A>__{the bartender takes a pelt and examines it. the mangy cat leaps up onto the bar and approaches. sniffs at the pelts with suspicion and hisses at eli. eli shoos the cat off the bar with a wave of his hand. at the biker's table hog watches this, not happy about this. satisfied with the pelts, the bartender gathers them up along with the scarf, then turns away toward the back room.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{solara!}
<A>__{a teenage girl emerges from the back. no older than 16 or 17. dressed in unflattering work clothes, face grimy, blonde hair tied back in a ponytail. but even through all this, it's clear she is a strikingly beautiful young woman. the bartender takes eli's canteen and hands it to solara along with a ration card he keeps around his neck.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{take this out back and get it filled.}
<A>__{solara takes the canteen, pausing for a moment to look eli up and down. unsure quite what to make of him, but intrigued. there's something about him she can't put her finger on... he doesn't look back at her. she turns and exits.}
<L>__{exterior desert town main street continuous}
<A>__{solara exits via the palladium's stage door and walks across the busy street to where two of carnegie's armed men stand guard around an enclosure of chain link fence topped with razor wire. townsfolk wait in line with bowls and buckets. one of the guards recognizes solara and lets her cut to the front of the line. he punches two holes in her ration card and lets her inside the chain link enclosure. inside is an old rusted spigot attached to a pipe emerging from the earth. solara cranks hard on the handle it takes a few pulls before the water comes, and then only at a weak trickle; it will take a while to fill the canteen.}
<L>__{interior palladium main lobby continuous}
<A>__{as eli sits at the bar, a shadow comes into view and looms large over him. hog is standing behind him, glaring, cutting a menacing figure in his armored cycle leathers. solara senses trouble brewing and moves off, taking eli's canteen away into the back room.}

<D>__{my name's carnegie. i own this bar. i own the whole town. you've never heard of me?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{that's you out there on the street.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{remarkable likeness, isn't it? you'd never guess half the men who built it were blind. a small tribute from a grateful people. i was deeply touched.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you had slaves build you a monument to yourself?}
<A>__{the mention of that word rankles carnegie. he walks around the desk toward eli, waves an admonishing finger at him.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{don't call them slaves. that's an old word. i'm not a slaver. i'm trying to help these people.}
<A>__{carnegie can't help himself once again he is in his natural element, spinning the argument his way, pitching. selling.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{in the outland the sightless are preyed upon like sick animals. here at least they're protected. they do the essential work others don't want. and in return they eat, they drink, they survive. last year, a couple of them even got married performed the ceremony myself.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you see, i'm not exploiting these people i'm saving them! any one of them is free to leave whenever they wish. but here they stay. and they thank me every single day for their salvation!}
<A>__{an impressive, impassioned performance. he sounds just like an old school tv evangelist. but eli is unmoved.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's none of my business what you do here. like you said, it's your town. i just want to be on my way.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{what's your name, walker?}
<A>__{eli doesn't respond. just stands there.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{all right, i guess we just call you walker. don't see too many folks your age these days. you lived in the world before? you can read?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i read every day.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{that's good. good man. we educated folk, we need to stick together, if we're ever going to rebuild this world. people like you and me, we're the future.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{what do you want with me?}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{straight to the pointerior i like that. fact is, you could be in a lot of trouble. this is a peaceful town. you walk in here, armed, and the next thing a dozen of my good citizens are dead. i've hanged men for less. i could hang you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{or, you could come work for me.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{i never once saw anyone handle themselves the way you did down there in that bar. i don't know where you learned it, but i sure as hell could use it.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm not interested.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{people who work for me can live better than any walker ever dreamed. real beds, clean water, hot food. women, even. you could do a lot worse, my friend.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm not your friend. and i'm not staying. i got someplace i need to be. out west.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{west? there is nothing west. it's all gone, a long time ago.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i've been told different.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{by who?}
<A>__{eli doesn't reply. carnegie smiles, dials up the charm.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{all right, look. i'm going to make you an offer of goodwill. stay the night, think it over. try a little local hospitality. we'll talk again in the morning. if you're still not interested, you're free to go. no hard feelings.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{thank you for your offer. but i'd prefer to just leave right now. so you can either let me out of here, or i can kill my way out.}
<A>__{the gunmen bristle, exchange nervous looks. carnegie appears unfazed. he smiles. beat. he looks to the gunman at the door.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{let him go.}
<A>__{the gunman opens the door. eli turns and exits.}
<L>__{interior engineer workshop day}
<A>__{the engineer stands behind the counter, looking worried. his heart sinks when he sees eli enter.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{oh, shit...}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{how's my battery?}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{it's, uh... it's gonna take a little longer than i thought.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{how much longer?}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{it's gotta charge overnight. you, uh, you can always stay here in town, pick it up in the morning.}
<A>__{eli leans in a little closer. he smells a rat.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you remember what i said would happen if i came back here and you didn't have my battery?}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{it's right here! it's just gonna take a while longer. i swear.}
<A>__{eli looks at the engineer. hard to be certain, but he's pretty sure he's lying. somebody got to him.}
<L>__{interior palladium auditorium carnegie's box}
<A>__{a violent commotion is heard from down the hall. suddenly one of carnegie's henchmen comes flying into view as he is thrown hard into a wall and slumps to the floor, unconscious. eli storms into the box, pissed. more guards rush in behind him. carnegie, seated behind his desk, waves the guards off as he stands to greet eli, smiling ingratiatingly as ever.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{i knew you'd reconsider.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{yeah? how'd you know that?}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{none of the walkers i've seen come here from the outland were ever what you'd call smart. i mean all those years out there alone on the road, some with their brains half fried from eating each other it's understandable why you people aren't the brightest bulbs in the box. but i never met one so dumb that he'd turn down a meal and a bed if it was offered.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{so you didn't send someone across the street to the engineer?}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{engineer? i don't know what you're talking about. if there's something wrong, maybe i can help.}
<A>__{carnegie is a practiced liar. much more difficult to read.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{this is redridge. he's kind of my right hand man around here.}
<A>__{redridge one of the two men who chased eli into the room steps forward. he regards eli with a distrustful eye.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{he'll show you to your room.}
<L>__{interior palladium guest bedroom dusk}
<A>__{redridge opens the door and ushers eli inside. it's another of the dressing rooms converted into a bedroom, less well appointed than carnegie's own. a threadbare rug. bed with relatively clean sheets. a sink for washing.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{enjoy your stay. there'll be someone outside your room all night. if you need anything.}
<A>__{redridge smirks and closes the door, leaving eli alone. eli paces across the room. finally sits down on the creaky old bed. trying to figure out how he managed to get stuck here. he unshoulders his pack, sets it down. lies down on the bed. it's been a while since he felt a real bed on his back. a knock at the door. eli gets quickly to his feet.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{the door opens and claudia enters. carrying a metal tub of water in both hands and, atop that, a dinner tray.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i have this for you. water for washing and some food.}
<A>__{eli just stands there. totally unfamiliar with this kind of situation, it's been too long. she smiles, embarrassed.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{well... are you going to take it?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{oh. thank you.}
<A>__{he takes the stuff from her, sets it on the table.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you're very welcome.}
<A>__{we get the impression that claudia is as unfamiliar with this kind of polite interaction as eli. but she likes it.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{it'll be dark soon.}
<A>__{she strikes a match and lights the oil lamp on the table. the room is lit by its flickering glow.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{can i get you anything else?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{no, thank you.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{well. have a good night.}
<A>__{as she turns for the door:}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you're carnegie's woman?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{why do you ask?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{just making conversation is all. haven't had one of those in a while. not a real one, leastways.}
<A>__{claudia smiles. neither has she.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{he found me in the outland. i was sixteen, my family had been... well, they were gone. there was just me and my baby.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you had a baby?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i'd met some men on the road. bad men. they...}
<A>__{beat. she trails off, struggling with this unhappy memory. eli gets it, raises a hand reassuringly.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's all right.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i was on the road for a year after that. i couldn't feed myself, let alone my little girl. and then bill found us and he promised he'd take care of us. he told me he was going to make a place where we could be safe. and he did. he did all that. he built this whole town. he kept us safe. and he raised that child like she was his own. he's been so good to both of us. he saved us, really.}
<A>__{there's a bittersweet quality to claudia's words. as though there is more to the story than she is telling. eli pulls out a chair at the table, offers it to her.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you want to eat some?}
<A>__{she smiles and sits. eli sits across from her.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{when did you go blind? in the war? you get caught in a flash?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{no, i was born this way. i think i'm lucky like that.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{lucky?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{it's not like i ever knew what i'm missing. i was already used to being like this by the time... by the time it all happened. so i got around pretty good even when i was on my own. and now it's easy. i know every creaky old floorboard in here, and it's not like i ever go any place else. bill would never allow it. he worries about me so much.}
<A>__{again, bittersweet. the sense that claudia feels trapped. thinking about it begins to upset her. she gets up.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i should go. he'll be wondering where i am.}
<A>__{eli stands, escorts her to the door and opens it.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{thank you. i enjoyed our conversation.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{so did i.}
<A>__{eli closes the door, then sits back at the table.}
<L>__{interior palladium carnegie's bedroom night}
<A>__{carnegie washes, looking at himself in the old dressing room mirror. he sees claudia enter the room in its dim reflection.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{you took your time in there. how long does it take to deliver a plate of food and some water?}
<A>__{a subtly accusing tone. it makes claudia nervous.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{he wanted to talk.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{oh? what about?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{nothing really. he asked me what it was like to be blind.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{he tell you anything about him?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{no. i don't think he likes to talk about himself much.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{yeah, i got that.}
<A>__{claudia moves to the bedside, begins to undress.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i don't think he's going to change his mind by morning. i don't think he's going to stay.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{what makes you say that?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{just strikes me as the kind of man who's of a mind, is all. doesn't seem like the type to go changing it once it's set.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{well, we'll just see about that.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you saw him. he's not like the others. you won't be able to smooth talk him and wrap him around your finger like you usually do.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{who said anything about me?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm sending solara.}
<A>__{claudia reacts suddenly to this. shocked and angry.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you're doing what?}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{you know how often these walkers get laid? never. least not by anything living or willing. girl like her can be very persuasive.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you can't send her in there with him. he's dangerous, he's a killer!}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{you went in there readily enough.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{that's different. solara's just a child, she can't }
<A>__{carnegie sighs, tiring of this.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{she's a grown woman now, claudia. sooner or later you're going to have to accept that. she has to earn her keep around here, same as the rest of us.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{by working as a whore? that's all you think she's fit for?}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{we've each been given a talent to help us make our way in this world. some people's gift is more evident than others. solara's sure as hell is.}
<A>__{claudia looks at carnegie in disgust.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{what kind of a man are you?}
<A>__{now it's carnegie's turn to get angry. he rounds on her menacingly. she backs off as he approaches.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{i'm the kind of man who'd pull a helpless blind girl off the road, a girl who'd been beaten and raped, and give her a place where she can live without fear! without me you'd be just another no eye, lying dead in the outland, picked clean by the buzzards, or shoveling dirt down there with the others. that's the kind of man i am!}
<A>__{he has her against the wall, his face just inches from hers.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i don't live without fear. i haven't for a long time now.}
<A>__{carnegie calms himself, backs off. claudia goes to leave.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i'm not going to let you do this.}
<A>__{carnegie surges forward and pins claudia to the wall.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{you're not going to let me?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{nobody tells me what i can and can't do in my own town. nobody. i built this world, and i am god here! so don't go thinking about screwing with my plans. you know how this works. solara goes against me, you get hurt. you go against me, she gets hurt.}
<A>__{he releases his grip on her.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{so let's not see anybody get hurt. okay?}
<A>__{he speaks more softly now. as he strokes his hand tenderly through claudia's hair, a tear runs down her cheek.}
<L>__{interior palladium guest bedroom night}
<A>__{dark outside, but the room is brightly lit by the glow of the oil lamp. eli sits up on his bed, quietly reading the old leather bound book from his backpack. another knock at the door. eli jumps up and hurriedly hides the book inside his shirt.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{the door opens to reveal solara. looking very different than she did before. cleaned up and wearing a flowery summer dress, blonde hair let down over her shoulders. stunning. unlike everyone else we have met, she seems physically, at least totally unscarred by the horrors of the times. far too beautiful a thing to belong in a world like this.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{hi. can i come in?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{someone was already here with food and water. i got everything i need.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{you sure about that?}
<A>__{she glides into the room, closing the door. she's good. very seductive. eli is totally disarmed in her presence.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{it's too bright in here. mind if i turn it down a little?}
<A>__{she doesn't wait for an answer. moves to the table and turns down the oil lamp. a darker, more seductive lighting scheme.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{that's better. i'm solara. you're walker, right?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{no. my name's eli.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{that short for something? elias?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{elijah.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{elijah. i never heard that one before. it's kinda cute.}
<A>__{she sits on the bed, kicks her legs playfully. her light cotton dress revealing in all the right places. the silhouette of her body bathed in the seductive glow of the oil lamp. no red blooded man on earth could resist her.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{look, i don't mean to be rude. but i'm really not interested.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{you sure about that? it gets mighty lonely out there on the road.}
<A>__{she leans over on the bed, resting on her elbow. her hair cascades down. god damn, she looks good.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{if you're worried about money, this is all paid for. the whole night.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's not that. you're a very nice girl. but i'm not that kind of man.}
<A>__{she slides off the bed, approaches him. begins to work the buttons of his shirt.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{they're all that kind of man.}
<A>__{he moves her hand away. gently pushes her back a step.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm not.}
<A>__{she is stunned. no man has ever turned her down before. and then she seems a little insulted.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{they told me you were crazy. maybe they were right.}
<A>__{eli opens the door for her.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm sorry. good night.}
<A>__{suddenly all her other emotions give way to fear. she moves to the door and slams it shut again. looks eli in the eye.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{please don't make me leave. i have to stay the night. if i don't...}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{if you don't, what?}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{he'll hurt my mom.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{who will? carnegie?}
<A>__{she nods, fighting back a tear. this angers eli.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{maybe he and i oughta have words.}
<A>__{he goes for the door handle, but she stops him.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{no! please, don't!}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{he's hurting you. he's hurting your mother. he's }
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{he's my dad.}
<A>__{beat. eli moves his hand away from the door.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{look, if you want to help me, just let me stay here tonight. we don't have to do anything. i will sleep on the floor. tomorrow you can tell my dad that we had a good time. i will be no trouble, i swear.}
<A>__{she looks up at eli imploringly. transformed. no longer the teenage sex kitten. now she's just a frightened little girl.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you want to have a conversation?}
<A>__{she smiles, wiping the tear from her cheek.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{eli and solara sit together on the bed. a silent beat. at first, it appears as though they have nothing to say.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you know, you don't have to be afraid of me. what happened down there in the bar...}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{i'm not afraid of you. i know you didn't start that trouble. when i first saw you, i knew you weren't the type to go looking for it.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{how'd you know that?}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{my mom says i'm a good judge of character. she says i can read people. that i know a good man when i see one.}
<A>__{she smiles. eli is surprised to find himself smiling back.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{so... you're pretty old, right?}
<A>__{eli smiles, amused by the bluntness of the question.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i just mean, i haven't seen too many people your age. how old are you exactly?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you know, i don't rightly remember.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{but you're old enough. i mean, you remember what it was like? in the world before?}
<A>__{eli nods.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what was it like?}
<A>__{eli thinks about this. dredging through old, old memories.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{better than this.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{people lived longer back then. longer than me. some were more than a hundred years old.}
<A>__{solara smiles like she's having her leg pulled.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{come on.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i swear, it's true. nowadays it's not the same. if you're sick or you're weak or you're old you won't last long out on the road.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{so how come you have?}
<A>__{beat. eli thinks. should he or shouldn't he?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{can i read you something?}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{wait. you can read?}
<A>__{eli pulls the book from his shirt. solara's eyes widen.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{and you have a book?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{not just any book.}
<A>__{for the first time we see that it's a king james bible. an embossed gold cross on its old leather cover. eli opens it up, scans the page with his finger until he finds the passage he's looking for.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{the lord is my shepherd. i shall not want. he makes me lie down in green pastures. he leads me beside still waters. he restores my soul. he leads me in the paths of righteousness.}
<A>__{on solara as she listens to eli read. transfixed.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death, i will fear no evil. for you are with me. your rod and your staff, they comfort me. you prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. you anoint my head with oil. my cup runs over. surely goodness and mercy shall follow me, all the days of my life. and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{that's beautiful. did you write that?}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what book is it from? is it poetry?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i guess you could think of it that way. it's from the holy bible.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{i never heard of it. what's it about?}
<A>__{beat as eli thinks. how on earth to answer that?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's about love, and forgiveness, and life and death, and mercy, and revenge, and the beginning and the end of the world. i guess it's about a little bit of everything.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{can i see?}
<A>__{she reaches out for the book but he snatches it away.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what? i'm not going to do anything.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm charged to protect this book. i can't trust it with anyone. not even for a while.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what's so special about that book?}
<A>__{beat. eli runs his fingers across the embossed gold cross on the beat up leather cover.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's the last one. there are no other books like this. all the others are gone destroyed by the war or in the burnings that came after. this is the only one that survived until now. the last one anywhere.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{how can you know that?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i just know.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{for a long while after it happened, i just wandered on the road like most everybody else. there were still a lot of people around back then, in the beginning. i didn't really know what i should do or where i was going. i was just moving from place to place, trying to stay alive. and then one day i heard this voice. i don't know how to explain it, it's like it was coming from inside me. but i could hear it, clear as day. clear as i can hear you talking to me now.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what did it say?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it led me to this place, i don't really know where. and i found this book buried deep under some rubble. no way no one was ever going to find it if they didn't know exactly where to look.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{but you knew because the voice told you?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{that's right. and that voice told me to carry the book west.}
<C>__{eli }
<D>__{it told me that a path would be laid out before me, that i'd be led to a place where this book would be safe. it told me i'd be protected against anyone or anything that tried to stand in my way. if only i would have faith.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that was twenty five years ago. and i've been walking ever since.}
<C>__{solara}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{because a voice you heard in your head told you to.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm not crazy. i didn't imagine it. i know what i heard.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{so who was it? the voice?}
<A>__{beat as eli considers his answer.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{a very important, very powerful man.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{more powerful than my dad?}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i should say so, yes.}
<A>__{beat. the two of them sit in silence for a moment.}

<D>__{what?}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{i never learned. no one around here knows how. only my dad, and he won't teach me. i think he likes being the only one who can read. i think it makes him feel powerful.}

<D>__{i think you're probably right.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{so would you teach me?}

<A>__{she walks over to where the dinner tray is covered by a small cloth. she whips it away to reveal eli's rat nibbling on a piece of cheese. solara shrieks and backs away. the rat scurries down the table leg and leaps up onto eli's shoulder, just as afraid of her as she is of it.}

<D>__{it does?}

<C>__{eli}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{she smiles. giggles as the rat's whiskers tickle her ear. eli breaks the cheese in two and gives half to solara. she's about to eat but stops as eli clasp his hands in prayer.}

<P>__{(quietly; to himself)}

<D>__{that cannon of yours casts a pretty wide net. i don't reckon you can hit me without hitting her.}

<D>__{i reckon you're right.}

<A>__{carnegie releases his grip on solara, steps away, hands up.}

<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{you know, i've been searching for a book like that one for years. all i've ever wanted was to bring the word of god to these poor unfortunates here. to shine its light upon them and give them something in this wretched world that they could believe in. something to live for! it's why i built this town, did you know that? all we've been missing is the word to show us the way. and now, praise the lord, you've brought it to us.}
<A>__{carnegie takes a step closer. he appears entirely sincere but then he is very good at doing so.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{it's not right to keep that book hidden away, all to yourself. the word is meant to be shared with others. it's meant to be spread! isn't that what you want? i could help you do that. you and me, we could do it together.}
<A>__{beat. eli seems to be considering what he's heard carefully.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{the lord himself told me that if i carried this book west, one day i would find the place where it was needed. where it would be safe. where it belonged.}

<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you shall not make for yourself any graven image...}
<A>__{he turns, drawing his samurai sword and in the same fluid motion slicing across the base of the statue. beat. and then the statue topples from the neat cut just below the knees, crashing down to the ground and shattering. the assembled residents gasp at this defiant display. eli sheathes his sword and takes solara by the hand again.}

<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you don't want this life. i gotta do what i gotta do. don't have no choice in it. but you do. and i can't let you choose this. you don't want to be like me. you don't want to spend your life alone.}

<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm sorry. look, maybe it's best you just go on back to town.}
<A>__{he turns and walks off, leaving her in the road. she stands there, furious, screaming at his back as he walks away.}

<D>__{fine! i will do just that! i had a life there! a family! i didn't ask you to save me! i didn't ask you for anything!}
<A>__{he doesn't turn or acknowledge her at all. just keeps walking off into the horizon. getting smaller all the time. solara stands there in the road, weeping. all alone.}

<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{thank you, darling.}

<D>__{he killed four of my men and walked out of town without a scratch. they shot off a hundred rounds at him and he didn't get hit once. i never even heard of anything like that.}

<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{you know, i always thought of myself as a shepherd. bringing together the wayward and the lost. tending to my flock. but all the things i want to do, i can't do them on my own. the one thing i've needed is the one thing that's always been missing. then one day it walks right into town so close i can almost touch it and then walks right on out again.}

<D>__{you have no idea. you're too young, you don't remember the world before. but i do. i remember.}

<D>__{do you remember how i built this town? it wasn't done with force, and it wasn't done just with water. it was done with the power of words. i created this place out of nothing, because people believed in a promise that i sold to them. those guys on the tv, they were richer than you could ever dream, and it was all built the same way. with words. with promises. and with that book.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that book is a weapon. aimed right at the hearts and minds of the weak and the desperate. just imagine what i could do with it.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{boss... we're running out of water and the people are running out of patience. you're trying to tell me that a book is going to keep them in line?}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{oh, it'll do much more than that. the water in this town may run dry, but faith that springs eternal! and that faith will help turn this town into a city. and this city into a nation. it will help me build a new world. in my image. people will come from far and wide to hear what's inside of it. they'll follow me anywhere just to get a taste of it. and they'll do whatever i tell them.}

<A>__{distant, calling from outside. solara hears it and freezes.}
<C>__{female voice }
<D>__{hello? can anyone help me?}
<L>__{exterior wasteland gas station continuous}
<A>__{she runs out across the forecourt, onto the road. a female figure is hunched by the side of the road about fifty yards up ahead. hard to see what she's doing from here.}
<C>__{slumped female}
<D>__{hello? is anybody there?}
<A>__{solara starts walking toward her. the woman has her back to solara. she's on her knees, muttering to herself. gathering objects up from the road. as solara moves closer, we see that the woman is struggling with an upturned shopping cart. stuck in a roadside ditch, its contents spilled out next to a few bracken bushes. we see her face now. it's the same young woman from before. the same shopping cart. the same trap.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{are you all right?}
<A>__{the woman looks around, sees solara standing nearby. she's shocked to see that it's a girl.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{oh. yes, i'm fine. thank you. you go along, i will be okay.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{you look like you need some help.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{no, really! i'm fine. really... i need a man to help. not you. you just keep along. please.}
<A>__{the woman seems anxious to get rid of her. tries to indicate the threat silently with her eyes, but solara doesn't get it.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{it'll just take a minute.}
<A>__{she steps into the ditch and starts to haul the cart out.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{really, it's fine! please!}
<A>__{too late. three road brigands pounce from the bushes. every bit as brutish and horrifying as the group that eli killed on the road in our opening. they grab solara and drag her from the road into the desert, screaming and kicking all the way.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{let her go! she ain't got nothing!}
<A>__{the brigand leader looks solara up and down lustfully.}
<C>__{brigand leader}
<D>__{i ain't too sure about that.}
<A>__{solara is reviled by the man. he's filthy, his stench overpowering. one eye missing, just a dark, empty socket. he licks his lips, revealing a mouth almost devoid of teeth.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{this wasn't the deal!}
<A>__{the brigand leader lashes out and grabs her by the throat.}
<C>__{brigand leader}
<D>__{shut your mouth, bitch. you oughta be grateful you're getting a break.}
<A>__{he releases her. she slumps to the dirt, whimpering.}
<C>__{brigand leader}
<D>__{never did care much for that dried up old snatch anyhow.}
<A>__{he looks back to the struggling solara.}
<C>__{brigand leader}
<D>__{this one, though... this one looks fresh. you a virgin?}
<A>__{she says nothing, just sobs helplessly.}
<C>__{brigand leader}
<D>__{well, let's find out.}
<A>__{he unbuckles his pants, lets them drop to his ankles. we hear a sound. it's hard to place. something like a thhup. the brigand leader is frozen in shock. his face goes pale, the blood draining from it. the two bandits holding solara look at their leader in dismay. staring down at his crotch. a quiet whimper escapes from his lips as he looks down. there is an arrow imbedded in his crotch. what was once down there is now just a bloody mess of mangled meat. more blood streams down his thighs. a real horror show. he staggers backward, shrieking. hands shaking. staring down at the awful wound from which the long arrow shaft extends. the two other brigands release solara and whip around, scanning the horizon. they see nothing. one of them has a rifle. he unslings it and aims it frantically around. then they both see it. coming right at them. the most terrifying thing either has ever seen. eli, walking toward them from the road, out of the sun. his silhouette distorted in the rippling heat. an avenging angel. he pulls another arrow and draws it back as the rifle bandit trains his weapon on him, finger tightening on the trigger. eli shoots. the arrow sails through the air and right into the rifle barrel. the feathers at the end of the shaft plugging the muzzle tight. rifle bandit pulls the trigger. the gun explodes, blowing his hands clean off. he falls to the ground, screaming. eli only had two arrows. he shoulders the bow and draws his sword. all the remaining brigand has is a small knife. the two now square off at arm's length. a hopeless mismatch. beat. the knife brigand hesitates, trembling. and then rushes eli with the knife. eli deftly sidesteps, flourishes the sword. so quick it almost seems like he didn't move at all. the knife bandit staggers forward a couple more steps. his hand goes limp and drops the knife. and then his head falls backward like a pez dispenser. almost completely decapitated, but not quite. blood fountains from the neck stump as his body falls to the dirt. eli moves to the other two bandits who lay horribly wounded on the ground, but still breathing. he stands over their fallen bodies. they stare back up at him, helpless. he crouches down between them in the dust.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i offer you both one final chance in this life to seek forgiveness for your sins so that your souls may find salvation. will you say with me the act of contrition?}
<A>__{the brigand leader defiantly spits blood at him.}
<C>__{brigand leader}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<A>__{eli sighs. stands and looks down on him without pity.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{some might think it'd be most fitting to leave you here like this. let you die slow in the sun. but i know better. i know where you're going. and the sooner you get there, the sooner you'll get what's coming to you.}
<A>__{he plunges his sword into the bandit leader, finishing him off. pulls the arrow from his crotch and wipes it clean. he turns to the other man, raising his sword.}
<C>__{rifle bandit}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{eli pauses, sword hovering over him, poised to strike.}
<C>__{rifle bandit}
<D>__{i want to say it. i want to be forgiven.}
<A>__{eli crouches once more by his side.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{repeat after me. oh god, i am heartily sorry for having offended thee, and i detest all my sins.}
<A>__{the bandit follows along with eli, mouthing the words quietly. the life ebbing from him with each moment.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i firmly resolve, with the help of thy grace, to confess my sins, and do penance, and to amend my life. amen.}
<C>__{rifle bandit}
<D>__{amen...}
<A>__{his eyes roll back as his final breath leaves him. dead. eli signs a cross over his body, then stands and walks away. solara sits on the ground nearby, a wreck. eli approaches and gathers her up in his arms. she clings on to him tightly.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{you came back for me.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{what are friends for?}
<A>__{she laughs, a tear rolling down her cheek. grips him tighter. he helps her up and escorts her back to the road.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{this is the deal. you keep up. you pull your weight. you fall behind, i can't help you. okay?}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{she looks back at the young woman still slumped in the dirt.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what about her?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{there's nothing can be done for her.}
<A>__{they walk on down the road.}
<L>__{exterior desert town main street day}
<A>__{metal garage doors roll back to reveal darkness within. a pair of headlights fires up. full beam right at us. a vehicle roars out of the darkness onto the street. heavily modified with plate armor and turret mounted weapons. but its original form still recognizable underneath. it's a honda odyssey minivan. once the #1 choice of soccer moms, transformed now into an armored personnel carrier. another minivan roars from the garage behind it. a dodge grand caravan, similarly customized and armed to the teeth. three more cars follow. as eclectic an assortment as you could imagine. a mini cooper. ford explorer. a prius. each adorned with plate armor and weapons. in the lead minivan is redridge, heavily armed. he nods to the driver, who guns the engine. the fleet of armored vehicles moves out, kicking up a great funnel of dust in their wake as they roar out of town.}
<L>__{exterior desert day}
<A>__{late afternoon. the sun hangs low on the horizon. we're far from the road. nothing but scrub brush and a few prairie dog burrows dotted around. a prairie dog pops its head up, scans the horizon. sniffing the air, whiskers twitching... and is skewered by an arrow. thirty yards away, one of the pieces of scrub brush appears to come alive. and then we realize it is eli's ghillie suit, camouflaging both he and solara beneath it. eli casts off the camouflage net and walks toward the dead prairie dog. solara just stands there, appalled.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{you killed it! that cute little thing!}
<A>__{eli picks up the dead animal by the scruff.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's good eating, is what it is.}
<A>__{he yanks out the bloody arrow. solara looks away. when she turns back, eli is standing right there, holding the dead animal in front of her face. she yelps in surprise and staggers backward, falling on her butt.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{that's not funny.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{if you're going to be on the road, you can't be picky about what you eat. you eat what's there to eat.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{i'm not eating that.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{more for me.}
<L>__{exterior wasteland cave dusk}
<A>__{eli and solara sit in the mouth of a desert cave, around a flickering campfire. the prairie dog roasts on a spit. eli digs his knife into the carcass, the blade comes out clean. it's done. he clasps his hands together and gazes down penitently at the ground.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{father, we thank you for your generosity in providing us with this meal. bless this food to our use and us to thy service, and keep us ever mindful of the needs of others. amen.}
<A>__{eli carves off a piece of meat. juicy and succulent. he bites into it, teasing solara by making a show of how good it tastes. he feeds a piece to the rat perched on his shoulder. solara tries to appear uninterested, but she's starved.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what does that taste like?}
<A>__{he takes another bite, thinks on this as he chews.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{tastes like chicken.}
<A>__{she tries to fight the temptation to try it... but she can't. she reaches out and tears off a piece. sniffs at it, takes a small bite... then quickly wolfs down the rest. eli smiles. as she eats, she gestures toward eli's saint christopher.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what is that?}
<A>__{eli reaches up and touches his hand to it.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's a saint christopher medal.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{who's saint christopher? is he a character from your book?}
<A>__{eli smiles and shakes his head.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{christopher was a man who lived a long time ago. he wanted to be a good man, he wanted to help people. so he would stand by a river that had no bridge and carry people across. he was a big strong man and there was no one he couldn't carry.}
<A>__{solara listens, rapt. eli is a good storyteller.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{then one day a young child came to the river and asked to be carried across. christopher tried to carry him but he was too heavy. he was just a small boy but he was heavier than any man he had ever carried. the boy explained that he was the son of god, and that he was so heavy because he bore all the sins of the world. after that, christopher was able to carry him across and when they got to the other side the boy baptized him in the river. and that's how he became a sainterior later on, he was known as the patron saint of travelers.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what is a saint, anyway?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's someone who spent their life doing good things for others. enough that god himself took a special interest in them.}
<A>__{solara looks at eli tenderly, with admiration.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{someone like you.}
<A>__{eli looks away, down at the ground. he appears sad.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{no. not like me. saints ain't killers. and i done too much of that. spilled too much blood.}
<A>__{beat. no words, just the flickering firelight.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{will you read me some more from the book?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's late. you should get some sleep. maybe tomorrow.}
<A>__{later night the fire down to its last embers. eli sleeps next to his pack, half hidden in the looming shadows of the cave. his hat and goggles hung up for the night on the hilt of his sword. solara sleeps nearby... then opens her eyes. not asleep after all. she looks over at eli his face hidden in shadow and so impossible to tell if he's asleep or awake.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{eli?}
<A>__{no response. quietly, she moves forward, kneeling by his side. she opens his coat and checks the pockets. empty. she goes deeper, peeling back the layers of clothing, stealthily frisking him. she finds something on his lapel, hidden under several layers, that causes her to stop. it's a rectangular plastic badge. the red, white and blue colors faded and worn. it reads:}
<D>__{welcome to wal mart}
<C>__{my name is "eli"}
<D>__{how may i help you?}
<A>__{she stares at it for a moment, not knowing what to make of it. then moves on, continuing to pat him down. whatever she's looking for is not here. she turns her attention to the backpack. slowly, carefully, opens it up. there it is. the bible, wrapped carefully in its neat little package of cloth and twine. she reaches in for it. suddenly, eli's hand shoots out and grabs her by the wrist. she cries out, startled. eli sits up, his face just a dark shape in the shadows. for the first time he appears a little scary to solara.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{you scared me! i thought you were asleep.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{on the road you sleep with one eye open. i asked you what you were doing.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{i just wanted to see the book.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you want to see the book, you ask me. nobody touches it but me. ever. until it gets where it's going. do you understand?}
<A>__{he's very forceful. she nods, a little afraid of him.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{tell me you understand!}
<A>__{he grips her wrist tighter.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{okay! i understand! ow!}
<A>__{eli releases her wrist. takes the pack from her and closes it up. pulls it closer to him and lies back down.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's no use to you anyway. you don't know how to read it.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{well... now we have the time, maybe you can teach me.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{maybe. get some sleep.}
<A>__{she lies back down beside him, but doesn't close her eyes. she just lies there, watching him.}
<L>__{exterior wasteland dawn}
<A>__{the sun rises out of the east. and out of the sun comes the fleet of armored vehicles. racing side by side down the road. the lead vehicle comes to a halt. a door opens and redridge gets out. more armed men emerge from the other vehicles and follow him as he marches into the wasteland by the roadside. the dead brigands are splayed out in the dirt where eli slew them. a flock of buzzards is picking their bones clean.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{he's been here.}
<A>__{redridge looks at the footprints in the dirt headed from the bodies and back onto the road. two sets of tracks.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{the girl's with him.}
<A>__{he moves back to the cars.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{move out!}
<A>__{the other men hold for a moment, still looking at the half eaten bodies in the dirt. redridge turns back.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{i said move out!}
<C>__{carnegie gunman}
<D>__{i heard this guy's protected somehow, some... power from up above. that there ain't nothing on this earth can touch him.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{he's just a man. you put a bullet in him, he'll go down like any other. i don't want to hear no more of this superstitious horseshit!}
<A>__{hesitantly, they make their way back to the vehicles. the cars gun their engines and move on down the road, past the abandoned chevron station. dust pluming in their wake.}
<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{eli and solara walk together, passing by a few burned out buildings. it appears we might be headed toward a town. solara looks up at the sweltering sun. then around at her surroundings. nothing but devastation and decay.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{you say you've been walking for twenty five years. have you ever considered that you might be lost?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{but how can you know? how can you know this is the right way?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i told you. my path has been laid out before me.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{yeah, but laid out by who?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{by almighty god.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{well if this god guy's so mighty, how come it's taking you so long to get where you're going? doesn't he know the way?}
<A>__{eli wheels around and jabs a scolding finger at her.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you want to stay on this road with me, don't ever let me hear you take his name in vain like that again.}
<A>__{solara is surprised by the severity of his reaction.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{eli resumes walking.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{god has a reason for everything being the way it is. it's not always apparent to us. but it is his plan nonetheless.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{so, is he talking to you right now? telling you where to go?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's not like that. it's kinda hard to explain. i'm guided by faith.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{i don't know what that word means.}
<A>__{beat as eli thinks on how to explain it.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it means you know something even though you don't know it.}
<A>__{solara thinks about this, shakes her head.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{that doesn't make any sense at all.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it doesn't have to.}
<A>__{they walk on.}
<L>__{exterior house day}
<A>__{on the outskirts of a small town that lies in ruins. almost every building burned or reduced to rubble. except for one small house. the building is damaged and worn but in mostly decent condition. it stands out among its surroundings for being the only structure still intact. the windows are barred. the outer structure fortified with sheet metal and other custom patch ups. the whole plot surrounded by a chain link fence topped with razor wire. eli and solara crouch behind a pile of rubble nearby.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{i don't get it. it looks almost... normal. like nothing ever happened. how can it still be out here?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{maybe we should look inside. there might be food.}
<A>__{beat as eli considers. then stands and unhooks his shotgun.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{stay behind me.}
<A>__{they approach the house cautiously. arrive at the perimeter fence. there's a gate held in place by a padlock. eli pulls a pair of bolt cutters from his belt and snips the padlock free. swings open the gate with a metallic squeak. they move inside, up the garden path. though the soil in the yard is dead, it's been carefully raked and tended. weeds arranged in thoughtful patterns, like real flowers.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{this is weird.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{eli steps forward, his foot planting on a cracked paving stone that shifts almost imperceptibly under his feet. accompanied by a barely audible sound. he looks down.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{a rope noose suddenly whips around their feet, tightening at their ankles and yanking them upside down into the air. eli drops his shotgun to the ground. they hang there for a moment, twisting in the breeze. the front door to the house swings open to reveal... an elderly couple. the woman's gray hair tied into a neat bun. the man bald, squinting through wire frame glasses. they look like the couple from grant wood's "american gothic." instead of a pitchfork the man holds a 12 gauge riot shotgun which he keeps trained from the hip on eli and solara. they step outside, regarding their new visitors carefully. the man seems more suspicious than his wife. he drags eli's shotgun toward him with his foot, hands it to his wife.}
<C>__{elderly man}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{my name is eli. this is solara. we're travelers, that's all. we don't mean you any harm.}
<C>__{elderly man}
<D>__{you cut my padlock. i saw you. trying to break into our house.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm sorry. we didn't think anybody lived here. we thought it was abandoned, like all the rest.}
<A>__{this seems to annoy the man.}
<C>__{elderly man}
<D>__{take a look around you. look at this yard. does it look abandoned to you?}
<A>__{clearly he's proud of the work he's done with the pitiful means at his disposal.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{no, sir. i... like what you've done with the place.}
<C>__{elderly man}
<D>__{what's your business here?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{no business. we're sorry to have troubled you. if you'll let us down we'll happily be on our way.}
<A>__{the wife steps forward, she's much warmer, less guarded.}
<C>__{elderly woman}
<D>__{george, look at them! they're not robbers or road agents! one of them's just a girl!}
<C>__{elderly man}
<D>__{seen that before. oldest trick in the book.}
<C>__{elderly woman}
<D>__{oh, stop! it's no trick. let them down!}
<A>__{the woman glares at him. the husband reluctantly accedes and moves to the concealed trap apparatus. releases the rope, dropping eli and solara to the ground in a heap. the old woman helps them to their feet. they shake off the noose from their ankles.}
<C>__{elderly woman}
<D>__{i'm so sorry about my husband. we so rarely get visitors these days, he's suspicious of everybody.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm martha and this is my husband george. would you care for some tea?}
<A>__{eli and solara exchange a look. what the hell is this?}
<L>__{interior house living room day}
<A>__{it's like something out of the world before. the interior is almost perfectly preserved. chintzy couches. a mahogany table. a tv set in the corner. lace curtains. unreal. eli and solara sit on the couch, feeling self conscious and looking entirely out of place in this cozy environment. george sits across from them on the couch, scowling at them inhospitably. the shotgun resting across his lap. martha emerges from the kitchen, carrying a tray laden with a tea pot and old china cups. cracked and faded, but intact. she places the tray on the coffee table and sits.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i'm afraid we don't have any cake or biscuits for the tea. they ran out some time ago.}
<A>__{she lifts the tea port and pours into the cups. but it's not tea, only water. somewhat murky water. eli and solara stare at the cups, unsure. martha gestures toward them.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{they raise their cups and take a sip. martha watches eagerly. it's clearly a thrill for her to be doing something as civilized and elegant as serving "tea" to guests.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{how do you like it?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's.. uh...}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{it's very good.}
<A>__{martha smiles, delighted. she lifts her own cup to her lips. her hands tremble, the cup rattling against the saucer.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{have you always lived here?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{for almost forty years now. this home is our pride and joy, isn't it, george?}
<A>__{george just grunts. not interested in conversation.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{we refused to leave, even during the troubles. we said, didn't we george, we said if we're going to die anywhere, we're going to die right here, in our own home.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i don't understand how you've survived out here this long.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{well, george is something of a handyman, aren't you, dear? he did a lot of work on the place, making it safe. we may be old, but we're resilient. we've had more than a few who've tried to take this place from us. haven't we, george?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yes. yes we have.}
<A>__{he stands and moves toward the back door. opens it up and beckons eli and solara to come look.}
<L>__{exterior house back yard continuous}
<A>__{eli and solara stand in the doorway, looking out on the yard. solara is horrified by what she sees. the entire back yard is a graveyard. maybe twenty human graves dug shallow into the earth. some were dug long ago, others look like they're very recent.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{are these... graves?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{of course. it would be uncivilized not to bury them. we're not barbarians.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{plus, it's good for the soil.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{come on back inside. i think i might be able to rustle up some sandwiches.}
<A>__{george and martha go back inside, leaving eli and solara gazing at the little graveyard.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{we have to get out of here.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{they look so sweet... i would never have believed they were killers.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{they're worse than that.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{they didn't just kill these people.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{they ate them.}
<A>__{solara is stunned.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{they what?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{there's a disease in the outland. spread by eating human meat. it affects the brain. dementia, loss of motor function. did you notice the old woman's hands shaking? she's got it. they've both got it.}

<D>__{oh my god...}
<L>__{interior house living room continuous}
<A>__{eli and solara re enter. solara looks at george nervously. he's still carrying that shotgun. martha's voice drifts in from the nearby kitchen.}
<C>__{martha }
<D>__{i found some meat for those sandwiches! are you hungry?}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{no! thank you!}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{we really must be going.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{so soon?}
<A>__{an unnerving glint in his eye. eli moves toward the door.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{yes, i'm afraid so.}
<A>__{as he gets to the door, george moves to intercept. hard to tell if he's blocking his path or moving to open the door for him. a tense beat. martha emerges from the kitchen.}

<C>__{george}
<D>__{a whole convoy of armed degenerates, that's what's wrong! coming here for them! and they led them right to us!}
<A>__{martha rushes to the window, pulls aside the lace curtain. outside she sees the armored vehicles screeching to a halt. the men spill out from the vehicles and take cover behind them, locking and loading weapons.}

<A>__{she rushes across the room, teeth gritted with determination.}
<C>__{george}

<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i finally got this house just the way i want it. i'm not going to let anybody tear it apart!}
<A>__{she goes to the couch and yanks off the seat cushions. underneath is a wooden lid which she throws open to reveal: a huge cache of weapons. automatic rifles. shotguns. pistols. grenades. and enough ammunition for everything. she pulls out an m 60 machine gun, slings the strap over her shoulder and locks in a chain of bullets. she looks like a post apocalyptic martha stewart.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{where did you get all this stuff?}
<A>__{george pulls out an ak 47, slots in a magazine.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{took `em off them who came looking to take the place from us. built up quite the stash over the years.}

<A>__{redridge raises his hand to silence him. looks up as an upstairs window slides open. a cloth package is tossed from the window. it lands in the dirt outside the perimeter fence a few yards from redridge. cautiously, he approaches. the package is wrapped in cloth and tied up with twine. it looks like eli's bible. he picks it up and tugs at the twine, untying it. folds away the cloth wrapping. looks for a moment in puzzlement at the object, at the words written on the front of it.}
<B>__{this side to face enemy}
<A>__{it's a miniature claymore mine. the small red light on top of the unit illuminates with a beep. armed.}

<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{get down! everybody get down!}
<A>__{he dives across the trunk of the explorer into cover as the mine explodes, shattering every window of every vehicle. the lightweight mini cooper takes the main brunt and explodes, cartwheeling through the air, a burning wreck. redridge looks around. three men lie dead already. flaming wreckage all around him. suddenly, it's a war zone. machine gun fire erupts from the house, peppering the vehicles' armor. the gunmen cower behind cover.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{damn you, return fire!}
<A>__{redridge aims at the house and opens fire. inspired by his example, the others follow. a hail of bullets criss cross back and forth. the house's faded paint facade is shredded.}

<A>__{redridge's men continue the hail of gunfire. six of them dead now, six more still standing. no lessening of fire from inside the house. they're losing. redridge races between the vehicles, ducking from gunfire until he makes it to the back of the dodge caravan. pops the trunk and pulls out a rocket propelled grenade launcher. he sets it on his shoulder, rests on the trunk to steady his aim. and fires. the rocket screams toward its target, tearing through the chain fence and tearing an entire corner from the house in a fiery explosion.}

<A>__{he finds her lying on the tile floor in what remains of the kitchen. or at least her top half. the rest of her is gone. george slumps to his knees with tear filled eyes. takes his wife tenderly by the hand for a moment. then the anger returns. he gets up and turns, consumed now by a wild fury. firing with rage over the torn brick wall. he clips another gunman in the head, killing him. george moves back toward the living room, firing as he goes.}

<L>__{exterior house day}
<A>__{eli and solara are shoved out of the house at gunpoint and marched past the torn perimeter fence to the vehicles. eli has been stripped of his weapons and backpack. redridge faces him and points a pistol at his head.}

<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{hello, what have we here?}
<A>__{and then suddenly he shrieks in pain. yanks his hand out to reveal eli's rat, teeth sunk deep into his flesh. redridge flails around violently, trying to get the rat off him, but it won't let go. his hand is bleeding badly.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{fuck! get it off! get it off me!}
<A>__{he finally manages to shake it free. it hits the floor dazed. redridge stomps on it with his boot, reducing it to a bloody smear in the dirt. eli lowers his head in sadness. redridge clutches his bloody hand, glares at eli furiously. pulls his gun again and marches right up to him, pressing the muzzle tight against his forehead.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{if you don't got the book, what fucking use are you?}

<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{no weapons.}
<A>__{eli still has a half dozen guns trained on him. he turns and walks away, toward the road. as he passes solara:}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i told you we'd both live. now do you have faith?}

<B>__{later}
<A>__{solara in the back seat, calmer now. the tears dried on her cheeks. she sits staring blankly at the driver in front. and then she lunges violently forward. clawing and biting at the driver, who struggles to fight her off. his hands come off the wheel and the car fishtails wildly. redridge's vehicle the driver sees something odd in the rear view mirror.}

<D>__{what the hell...?}

<C>__{solara}
<D>__{come on, come on...}
<A>__{eventually, she sees him. at first just a dot on the horizon. but unmistakably eli. by now, she'd know him anywhere. suddenly the engine splutters. she checks the fuel gauge; the needle deep in the red. she pounds the wheel in frustration.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{no... no!}
<A>__{the car grinds to a halt, dead. she flings open the door and leaps out of the vehicle, rushing after eli on foot. on eli. as always, his pace steady and slow. the sun directly ahead of him as it sets on the horizon. headed always west. solara is running up behind him, a hundred yards back.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{eli! eli!}

<B>__{beat.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i forgive you.}
<A>__{she continues walking alongside him. trying to process this. this kind of compassion is totally foreign to her. she holds out the sword, offering it to eli by way of atonement.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{here. i thought you might still need this.}
<A>__{eli seems appreciative that she would think to return it to him. he takes it and slings it over his shoulder.}

<D>__{be prepared to surrender any weapons at the gate!}

<D>__{i was sent here by god.}
<A>__{lombardi raises a quizzical eyebrow.}
<C>__{lombardi}
<D>__{is that right? well, it's good to know we're getting such high profile referrals these days.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i must say, i am so excited that we finally have a king james. you know, we have a talmud here, we have two korans, we even have that scientology book. but never a christian bible, until now. i honestly believed it was the one book i'd never see again, after what happened...}
<A>__{beat. lombardi appears sad for a moment.}
<C>__{lombardi}
<D>__{may i ask what condition it's in?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's a little beat up. but it'll do the job.}
<C>__{lombardi}
<D>__{well, then. what say we take a look at it?}
<A>__{lombardi looks at eli with anticipation. so does solara, interested to know where this is going to go nexterior eli winces in pain, puts his hand to his side.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{is there someplace we could sit?}
<C>__{lombardi}
<D>__{of course. right this way.}

<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{did you get it?}
<A>__{redridge holds the bible up proudly. carnegie beams.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{show me.}
<A>__{redridge hands it over. carnegie sits back in his chair, running his hand lovingly over the battered leather cover.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{the new world begins here...}
<A>__{he opens the book and looks inside. beat. and then he looks up at redridge, confused.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{what the fuck is this?}
<L>__{interior alcatraz cafeteria day}
<A>__{eli, solara and lombardi sit at one of the long lunch room tables. the two armed guards keep watch nearby.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{do you have something you can write with?}
<C>__{lombardi}
<D>__{mmm? oh, yes of course!}
<A>__{he pulls a pen from his pocket, motions to one of the guards.}
<C>__{lombardi}
<D>__{could you please bring us some writing paper?}
<A>__{the guard nods and moves toward the door. as he does so:}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{bring a lot of it.}
<L>__{interior palladium auditorium carnegie's box}
<A>__{carnegie looks at the open bible, jaw hanging loose, his complexion ashen. like he's just been slapped in the face.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{what? what is it?}
<L>__{interior alcatraz cafeteria day}
<A>__{the guard brings a thick sheaf of writing paper to the cafeteria table, sets it down by lombardi.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{are you ready?}
<C>__{lombardi}
<D>__{what exactly am i writing?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{pay close attention and write down every word exactly as i say it.}
<A>__{eli removes his goggles. solara can't believe what she sees. his eyes are pale, milky white, dead. totally blind.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{the first book of moses called genesis. chapter one, verse one. in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth. verse two. the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. and the spirit of god was hovering over the face of the waters. verse three. and god said, "let there be light," and there was light.}
<A>__{lombardi hurriedly writes down every word.}
<L>__{interior palladium auditorium carnegie's box}
<A>__{carnegie sits at his desk, still in shock. eli's bible sits open on the desk before him.}
<B>__{a braille bible.}
<A>__{claudia is ushered in by a guard.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<A>__{he rushes forward and thrusts the bible into her hands.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{you told me once that you know how to read this. this blind language.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{well, a long time ago, when i was a little girl...}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{you're going to read it for me. every word. and i'm going to write it down. start at the beginning.}
<A>__{as carnegie hunts on his desk for a paper and pen, claudia opens the book and trails her fingertips across the raised lettering. for a moment there is a glimmer of recognition... a faint smile... but then it fades as carnegie turns back to her, eagerly clutching the writing materials.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it's been so long. i don't remember. i don't remember any of it.}
<A>__{carnegie is aghast. beat as the anger swells within him, threatening to explode...}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{god fucking dammit!}
<A>__{he swipes violently at the bible, knocking it out of claudia's hands. he grabs it up and tries to rip it in two, but it's too thick to tear. red faced with rage, he tosses it out over the box balcony. it lands somewhere in the dark auditorium below, between the rows of gutted theater seats. as he paces angrily back past claudia:}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{bill, is there something }
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{just go. just get out of my sight.}
<A>__{he slumps in his chair, exhausted and furious. claudia sadly turns and leaves him alone with his thoughts.}
<L>__{interior alcatraz cafeteria night}
<A>__{some considerable time later. great stacks of paper have been filled with lombardi's handwriting. lombardi's pen races across the paper, struggling to keep up with eli's recitation. solara is curled up on a nearby bench, asleep. eli's coat covering her to keep her warm. eli clutches his wound painfully as he continues to recite. he looks paler now than ever. close to death.}
<C>__{eli }
<D>__{dear lord, thank you for giving me the strength and the conviction to complete the task you entrusted to me. thank you for guiding me straight and true, through the many obstacles in my path. eli (v.o.) (cont'd) and for keeping me resolute when all around seemed lost.}
<L>__{exterior alcatraz exercise yard pre dawn}
<A>__{the prison yard shrouded in the dim light just before dawn. solara crosses the yard. she looks more mature somehow. determined and strong. she carries with her eli's sword and something else, tucked under her arm.}
<C>__{eli }
<D>__{thank you for your protection and for your many signs along the way.}
<A>__{she stops in a nondescript corner of the yard. at her feet is a shallow mound of dirt. at the head of the mound, a simple tombstone. she kneels and places a single flower on the grave.}
<L>__{interior palladium carnegie's bedroom night}
<A>__{lit only by the pale moonlight, barely enough to see by. carnegie sleeps soundly in bed. next to him lies claudia, wide awake. she checks that carnegie is sound asleep, careful not to wake him before she creeps out of bed and exits.}
<L>__{interior palladium auditorium night}
<A>__{claudia is on her hands and knees in the darkness, searching blindly in the aisles and beneath the theater seats. she finds eli's bible in some litter strewn on the floor.}
<C>__{eli }
<D>__{thank you for the good that i have done. for whatever light you were able to shine into the darkness of this world through me.}
<A>__{sitting in the darkness, claudia opens the book and runs her fingers across the braille, reading. and though we can barely see in the dim light, we see the smile on her face. the joy.}
<L>__{exterior alcatraz exercise yard dawn}
<A>__{as solara kneels by the grave, we see now that she wears eli's saint christopher pendant around her neck. the tombstone reads:}
<B>__{here lies elijah stone}
<A>__{died august 21, 2048}
<B>__{faithful servant to the lord and friend to solara}
<A>__{she unsheathes eli's sword, plants it in the ground before his grave. takes the book from under her arm and opens it up. it's a new bible. crudely typeset from lombardi's original transcription and printed on the prison press. she opens it up and begins to read a passage from the bible over eli's grave. we don't hear what she says. as solara finishes her reading and closes the bible, lombardi appears behind her.}
<C>__{lombardi}
<D>__{you know, you don't have to leave. you're welcome to stay here with us. you'll be safe.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{thanks.}

<C>__{solara}
<D>__{but i gotta do what i gotta do.}
<C>__{lombardi}
<D>__{where will you go?}
<A>__{beat. solara looks at the sword, her fingers playing across its hilt. the blade glimmers in the light of the rising sun. there is a determined, purposeful look in her eye.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{home.}
<L>__{exterior alcatraz island dawn}
<A>__{the sun rises through the fog on the horizon. the great iron gates grind open. solara emerges from inside the prison, steps out onto the island rock. she is dressed in a flak jacket, combat pants and boots. eli's old pack across her back. hair tied in a neat pony tail. atop that, eli's ragged fur hat.}
<C>__{eli }
<D>__{thank you for the friend i made.}
<A>__{in her hand she clutches a copy of the newly printed bible. eli's sword slung over her shoulder.}
<C>__{eli }
<D>__{please watch over her as you watched over me.}
<A>__{montage as solara walks back along fisherman's wharf... through the san francisco rubble... across the golden gate bridge...}
<C>__{eli }
<D>__{thank you for allowing me finally to rest. i'm so very tired. the time of my departure is at hand and now i surrender my soul into your care, at peace in knowing that i have carried out your will. that i have done right with my time on this earth.}
<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{...and finally back onto a desolate road leading off into the desert wasteland. she looks up and down the road, then turns and heads toward the sun on the horizon. headed east.}
<C>__{eli }
<D>__{i have fought the good fight. i have finished the race.}
<A>__{as she walks away into the sun, her lonely silhouette on the road reminds us of eli as we saw him so many times before.}
<C>__{eli }
<D>__{i have kept the faith.}
<A>__{she grows smaller and smaller as she walks into the distance, until she consumed by the rising sun and we}
