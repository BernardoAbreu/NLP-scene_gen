<C>__{teresa}
<D>__{anything specific?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you know...like restaurants, night clubs...}

<P>__{(affectionately)}
<D>__{what is it now?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{don't ask.}
<A>__{he gives her a quick kiss on the tip of her nose.}
<C>__{teresa}
<D>__{alright... hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{did you?}
<C>__{teresa}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{christ, you should have seen it. unbelievable. the kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like rasputin. that kid was scared. not half as much as we were though.}
<C>__{teresa}
<D>__{it doesn't make any sense. he wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you missed the pointerior the kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man he gets a reputation. he thinks he's in good standing.}
<C>__{teresa}
<D>__{it's still sick.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{not sick...just stupid. speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.}
<A>__{teresa laughs at this story but her mood changes suddenly.}
<C>__{teresa}
<D>__{you're sure he doesn't know.}
<A>__{he takes her in his arms.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{don't worry.}
