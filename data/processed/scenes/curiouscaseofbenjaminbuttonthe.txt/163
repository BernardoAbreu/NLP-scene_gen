<A>__{...and we see a taxi door being opened in slow motion... and daisy, dressed for the night, glides out... a man helping her... and we see benjamin a step behind getting out of the car... dressed to the nines... hair slicked, elegant... but nonetheless, a step behind... and we hear daisy's voice, from somewhere else...}

<D>__{...i danced for a man named ballenchine...he's a famous choreographer. he said i had a perfect line. they asked ballenchine to describe what he did. he said, "i'm a carpenter." isn't that amazing? in one of his rehearsals a dancer fell. he put it into the production. can you imagine that in a classical ballet? a dancer intentionally falling? he isn't the only one, agnes demille, lincoln kirstein, richard pleasant, lucia chase...there's a whole new word for dance now, it's called abstract..."}
