<L>__{interior theo's room night}
<A>__{marrow and theo stand in the doorway to the shared bathroom watching luke finish taping a trash bag over nell's broken window. nell lies in her bed, asleep or unconscious, it's impossible to say. luke finishes, comes over. marrow is hushed, grim, exhausted.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{she needs help.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{i will take her with me to the university tomorrow. i can't believe i read the test wrong. i didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you used the wrong test.}
<C>__{theo}
<P>__{(indignant)}
<D>__{will the two of you shut up! god damn it! maybe the tests were right, marrow. she's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but i don't think she's suicidal and i didn't have to test her. maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. maybe she was really scared. maybe she really heard voices.}
<A>__{marrow looks away, doesn't want to say this. theo reads the feelings on his face.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you're not telling us something.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{watts. those were his keys nell found. his roommate called and said watts left when he was supposed to. i think he's here.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{he's wandering around the house, and nell heard him. she thought it was ghosts. let's go look for him again.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{no. if he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over. what we have to do now is be together, with nell.}
<A>__{and they go. three scared people.}
