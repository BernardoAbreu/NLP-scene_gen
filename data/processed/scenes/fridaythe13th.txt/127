<D>__{here we go.}
<A>__{the camera watches jack's actions tightly. in a reverse pov we see jack's tongue come out the side of his mouth as he concentrates. he bites down on it. another angle: as jack pulls the starter cord. the engine roars into action.}

<D>__{now ya' close the switch.}
<A>__{cu as jack's hand reaches in and touches a heavy duty metal switch. a spark arcs and we pull back to see jack with a perfect connection running through his body. there is a sparking sound, the little light in the shed blinks, jack screams, the generator chugs roughly. hundreds of volts are streaking through jack's body and grounded through his wet shoes. bill reacts quickly: knowing better than to touch him and continue the connection, he takes a half step backwards, aims at an oblique angle and executes a perfect bruce lee type drop kick on his friend, severing the contact. jack stumbles out of the shack and the light goes dead. the machine stops.}
