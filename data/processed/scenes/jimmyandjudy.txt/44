<T>__{camera on:}
<L>__{exterior forest meadow running naked day}
<A>__{judy films jimmy. the camera is close and intimate as they lie on their sides staring into each other's eyes. judy is still naked, but is being shot in an extreme close up.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{okay, go.}
<A>__{jimmy's still not up for it. judy grabs the camera and turns it on him.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{jimmy's turns the tables.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{okay, you really wanna hear something?}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{jimmy takes a deep breath, a touch of intensity flashes in his eye, then...}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i want to go one day without masturbating. i want to liberate my penis. i want to clone you so we could have a three way and neither of us would be cheating. i want you to scrape my balls with a cheese grater...}
<A>__{judy starts laughing. the camera's shaking.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{that's gross!}
<A>__{jimmy suddenly gets serious.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{and i love you. i love you so much it hurts.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{it hurts?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{like god is stabbing me in heart with a thousand knives at the same time and you're the only one who can make the pain go away. do you love me that much?}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{i love you so much, i'd rather die than be without you.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{jimmy grabs the camera and points it at judy.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{make me a promise... the way a husband and wife make a promise... that we will be together always and forever.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{you mean get married?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{something more powerful than marriage. it's a bond. it's our bond. it's transcendental.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{transcendental.}
<P>__{(grabs the camera)}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{jimmy hands judy the camera as she starts to frame him up, but they're really engaging each other's eyes over the top of the eyepiece.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{it's transcendental because it transcends everything. life, love, law, people, things... a bond so strong that our souls will become one and it can never end, even in death. if you swear on the bond, it means you'd rather die than break your promise.}
<A>__{judy is moved.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{that's so beautiful.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{you're so beautiful. i want to love you forever.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{swear on the bond. swear we'll be together forever, that you'd rather die than be apart.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i swear on the bond.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{and we'll never let anything come between us, not even death.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{not even death. i swear. nothing will come between us, ever.}
<A>__{jimmy stares at her, then slowly leans in for a kiss... a long, wet, toe curling kiss. jimmy finds a way to point the camera at the kiss. they break apart. judy sighs, staring into jimmy's eyes, then leans into him, his lips touching her forehead, their eyes closing as they feel the energy of true love.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{we'll be together forever.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{together forever.}
<A>__{camera shuts down.}
