<A>__{through the window, the crew is setting up a shot while eli rehearses with nina and his red haired male star, raymond bailey, (who cameron earlier saw on the beach). bailey is dressed as a world war i british aviator and nina as a young girl of that era.}
<C>__{denise's voice}
<D>__{our male star isn't going to like you...}
<A>__{two shot cameron and denise}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(moving toward window)}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{you're too good looking. his idea of a perfect stunt double is two hundreds pounds of hamburger in a red wig...}
<A>__{he studies the view, his attention focused on nina.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{what's she like? i've seen her on tv.}
<C>__{denise}
<P>__{(irritated by his interest in nina)}
<D>__{at selling douche powder, she's fabulous; dog food?...i'm not sure she's sincere.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{what are you sore about?}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{i'm not sore. isn't that what you wanted to know?}
<P>__{(with sarcasm)}
<D>__{...or did you mean, what's the real nina franklin like without the greasepaint and tinsel...}
<A>__{moving to a pile of laundry heaped on the floor, she pokes around with the toe of her shoe.}
<C>__{denise }
<D>__{...you mean, what's she like underneath?}
<A>__{snaring a crumpled garment, she kicks it toward cameron, who catches it instinctively, then holds it up for inspection a pair of (nina's) lace panties. he grins, mildly embarrassed by the charade.}
<C>__{denise }
<P>__{(moving toward him)}
<D>__{what do those say about the girl who wears them? shy? delicate? sensitive?}
<A>__{she reaches for the panties, but instead takes his hand and yanks sharply, pulling him off balance, falling back on the laundry pile with cameron on top of her, their faces inches apart; surprise on his, amusement on hers.}
<C>__{denise }
<P>__{(touching his hair)}
<D>__{still wet...very wet.}
<A>__{cameron is trying to remember: what was it eli said? "close your eyes, relax and enjoy." across the room the washing machines churn, whirl and heave.}
