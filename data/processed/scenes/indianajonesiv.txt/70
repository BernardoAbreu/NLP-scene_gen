<A>__{the bizarre sound echoes through the taxi. indy exchanges a puzzled look with the others.}

<D>__{that sound. again.}
<C>__{scraggy}
<P>__{(listening)}
<D>__{still far away...but getting closer.}
<A>__{the sound stops. indiana is bothered. disturbed. kezure leans forward. he points to a clustered area of jungle. nearly a mile in the distance.}
<C>__{kezure}
<D>__{the village is there. beyond the thick of jungle.}
<A>__{scraggy nods. he drives toward the village. suddenly, an arrow shoots through the window! just missing everyone. it shatters the passenger window. a tribe of native warriors appear on the terrain. there are hundreds. screaming in high pitched squeals. their bodies adorned with red and white painterior the angry warriors run toward the taxi. firing arrows! on the taxi roof, the men dive for cover. arrows whiz by their heads. inside, everyone rolls up the windows. the taxi is attacked with a shower of arrows. scraggy floors the gas. the taxi keeps moving ahead. speeding toward the jungle. indiana glares at kezure.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{thought you said they knew you?...}
<A>__{kezure gives a puzzled shrug. the warriors continue to chase the taxi. getting closer. firing more arrows. the taxi spins to a stop. directly in front of a large opening that leads into the jungle. everyone pours out of the taxi. arrows fly by their heads. they dash through the opening. into the jungle. the warriors stop. outside of the opening. they don't enter. turning to each other, they begin to laugh. victorious.}
