<L>__{interior the denied area elevator bank night}
<A>__{the senator (let's just call him ethan) and sarah come down the stairs and pass a sign that says "denied area political attaches only." ethan checks his watch. 23:00. he nods to sarah, they round a corner, and come to an elevator at the end of the corridor. a sign in front of it says "out of order." they head for it anyway. a marine guard appears from behind a side door, catching them by surprise.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{governor's in position. we have the elevator.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{excuse me, can i help you?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{ which leads directly to the denied area, the only limited access area in the whole facility.}
<A>__{sarah flashes an id at the guard and keeps talking.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{as you can see. this area has both a marine guard and video surveillance, and is strictly monitored at all times.}
<A>__{she walks up to the thumbprint analyzer on the elevator bank and slides her thumb inside. the panel lights up and flashes a message "access denied." sarah and ethan trade a look.}
<C>__{sarah }
<P>__{(covering)}
<D>__{senator, don't you have a young man on your staff named jack?}
<A>__{she tries the thumb again, still no soap.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{jack? i believe we did have a young man named jack. not a reliable man, as i recall. constantly late or behind in his work.}
<A>__{now the guard, noticing that sarah's not being allowed access, comes closer to them.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{excuse me, let me see that id again!}
