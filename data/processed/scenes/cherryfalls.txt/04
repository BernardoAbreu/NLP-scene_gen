<A>__{a teenage boy's hand is under a teenage girl's shirt, gently massaging her breast. he pulls his hand out from under her shirt and places it on her bare knee. as he starts to slide his hand up her leg, she grabs his hand and gently pulls it away. she places it back on her breast, sliding it under her shirt. we pull back. stacy and rod, two healthy sixteen year olds, are passionately making out in the proverbial back seat of a big american car. rod smiles seductively, kisses stacy, and places his hand back on her knee. once again, she stops him, this time just squeezing his hand tightly.}

<D>__{no.}
<A>__{he doesn't give up easy. he playfully wrestles his hand free and slides it under her skirt. she grabs his hand again.}

<C>__{stacy}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<D>__{yeah. i'm extremely worried about that. it's right up there with global warming.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{on our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. terminate us instantly. we'd never experience what it means to make love.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{if sheep don't count.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{that wasn't me ...}
