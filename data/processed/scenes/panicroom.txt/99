<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{burnham turns abruptly. he turns around. they all freeze, listening. he hears it again. the hollow boom, coming from inside the wall. now a third time. he walks forward, slowly, toward the wall.}
<B>__{boom.}
<A>__{he moves closer, gets right up next to the wall. he leans into the wall, putting his ear right up next to the air duct. this close, he hears the sound in more detail, realizes it's two sounds.}
<B>__{scratch. boom.}
<A>__{he arches an eyebrow. inside the duct, meg's hand is trembling, tiring. she tries again, thumbs the flint wheel. it scratches as it rolls, her hand twitches, booms against the side of the duct. still, the gas hisses through. in the panic room, meg's face is turning color, she's running out of air. her feet tremble on the shelf, she's about to lose her footing. inside the duct, she tries again. scratch. boom. in the bedroom, burnham's eyes suddenly pop wide as he identifies the sound.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{he tears himself away from the wall inside the duct, meg's thumb tenses for one good hard turn in the bedroom, burnham leaps through the air, hurling himself toward the propane tank inside the duct, meg cranks the wheel, a spark sparks, a flame flames, and a hot blue cloud shoots out in two directions, one toward the panic room, the other toward the bedroom. in the panic room, meg jumps off the shelf, throwing herself as far away from the vent as she can, her arm engulfed by licking blue flame. she drops to the floor of the room, covering her daughter's body just as the entire ceiling of the panic room turns into a lake of fire with a deafening whoomp. the fluorescent light tubes explode, showering glass everywhere. in the bedroom, the blue flame shoots out of the wall, into the hose, through the hose, backing up toward the tank. burnham crunches to the floor next to the tank, knocking the other end of the hose away from the spigot just as the blue flame erupts from the end of the hose. the flame engulfs his entire body, his hair starts on fire, his chest, his arms. raoul lunges forward, junior tears the blankets from the bed and throws them over him, burnham howls and rolls on the floor in pain. in the panic room, the blue cloud on the ceiling suddenly evaporates with another angry whoomp, leaving a few little pockets of flame that meg extinguishes by swatting with a blanket. only one of the fluorescent lights is left intact; it casts a flickering, uneven light on the room. she stands in the middle of the still smoky panic room, breathing hard. she shouts, screams incomprehensibly, making no sense whatsoever. she stops, noticing the look sarah is giving her. wide eyed admiring, frightened, you are an insane woman. meg looks to herself. her arm is signed, the hair burned off. the sleeve of her t shirt is burned back to the shoulder. her face is sooty, blackened. meg grunts, half frightened by herself.}
