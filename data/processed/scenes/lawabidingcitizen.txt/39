<L>__{exterior industrial zone night}
<A>__{tracks and factories, remote and deserted. far away, the police copter is still buzzing, searching... the police cruiser appears, stops. darby emerges with gun and flashlight leveled, motions for the cop to get out. the cop complies with hands raised, shaking.}
<C>__{darby}
<D>__{in the ditch.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{...please...don't kill me...}
<C>__{darby}
<D>__{knees. let's go.}
<A>__{darby shoves him stumbling into the ditch. the cop sinks to his knees and starts to weep.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{i will never see my wife and little girl again. i will never see them.}
<C>__{darby}
<D>__{it's fucked up.}
<A>__{darby steps closer, draws the hammer back, takes aim for a head shot...but his phone rings. he pulls it fast.}
<C>__{darby}
<D>__{this my guardian angel?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{on his knees in the muck, the cop's quiet weeping becomes soft laughter. he brings up a cell phone, speaks into it:}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{i see you got out okay.}
<A>__{darby draws back, confused, gun still aimed. the cop snaps his cell phone shut, rises to face him.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{you know why i will never see my wife and daughter again?}
<A>__{he takes his hat off, peels his moustache away. darby pins him with the flashlight, finally and fully revealing:}
<C>__{benson clyde}
<D>__{you took them from me.}
<A>__{recognition floods darby. he pulls the trigger, and: nothing. just a click, darby freezing, a hiss of pain. not comprehending. clyde reaches for the gun, pries open darby's fingers, pulls it from his grasp... revealing the tiny needles that sprang from the pistol's grip into darby's palm. darby stares at his perforated palm. his knees give out and clyde catches him, eases him to the ground.}
