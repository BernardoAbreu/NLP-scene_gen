<C>__{david}
<D>__{know why saint jude is the patron saint of lost causes? 'cause his real name was judas. there were two judases, judai, the saint guy and the bad judas who ratted on jesus, and tried to kiss him. medievalers wouldn't pray to good judas for fear of getting bad judas on the line by mistake. ergo, they only gave him business when really desperate. that's why. then they changed his name.}
