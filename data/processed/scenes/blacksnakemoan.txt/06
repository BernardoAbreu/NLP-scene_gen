<L>__{interior ronnie's trailer bathroom morning}
<A>__{ronnie is vomiting into the toilet as rae rubs his head. each painful dry heave makes rae comfort him more.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{baby...}
<L>__{exterior ronnie's trailer morning}
<A>__{ronnie places his duffle bag in gill's truck. rae begins to cough.}
<C>__{gill}
<D>__{you sick?}
<A>__{rae doesn't answer. gill backs away, allowing ronnie and rae some privacy. the two lovers stare into each others eyes and then embrace. rae peeks over ronnie's shoulder at gill with an expression of dread. anger seizes her.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{this ain't gonna work.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{rae...}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{i don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and i know this ain't gonna work.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(holds her face in his hands)}
<D>__{rae don't do this now...}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{it's stupid... it's so fucking stupid!}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{rae!}
<A>__{silence. rae melts. tears stream down her face.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(reaches in his pocket)}
<D>__{look it. i got somethin' for us. this is gonna help, okay.}
<C>__{gill}
<D>__{you gonna miss your bus.}
<A>__{ronnie removes a small digital watch and fastens it around her wrist.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{this watch here is gonna beep at midnight. every night. that's when it comes up on you the hardest, right?}
<A>__{ronnie holds out his own wrist to show her his identical watch.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{and wherever i'm at, my watch'll beep, too. we'll be thinkin' bout each other at the same time. wherever we are.}
<A>__{rae is shaking. he grips her by the back of her neck and pushes their faces inches away. eye to eye.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i gotta believe we can do this or i ain't gonna make it, rae.}
<A>__{rae sees the fear in his eyes. she swallows her own anxiety and nods.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{okay... okay.}
<A>__{they kiss passionately.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{afraid of his swelling emotion, ronnie quickly breaks away from her. rae watches as her love leaves in gill's pick up. compelled to follow, she absently walks after the truck, down the gravel drive. she stops. silence. she is alone. an intense wave of sorrow hits, like a kick to her gut. she gasps for breath as she struggles to hold back the flood of her tears. rae drops to her knees, right there in the gravel drive. her hair falls in front of her face, masking her grief. her shoulders shudder. her middle finger begins to scratch at her thigh repeatedly a nervous habit that has always accompanied this burning sensation that consumes her.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{tears come to her. she's not going to be able to stop it.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{goddammit, ronnie...}
<P>__{(shouting in frustration)}
<D>__{goddammit!}
<A>__{rae is gripping the watch around her wrist for comfort. her breathing is already out of her control. the dizziness is already upon her. the familiar burning. she inhales in gasps, rocking back and forth on her knees. the late morning cicadas chirp in an undulating frenzy.}
<C>__{rae}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{mm mm}
<P>__{(meaning "no")}
<D>__{mm mm... mm mm...}
<A>__{the scratching at her leg leaves a red mark. she is dizzy with anxiety. her teeth are clenched, her face is flush.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{mm mm! mm mm! mmmmmmmmmmmm!}
