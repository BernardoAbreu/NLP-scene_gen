<A>__{electra is sitting on the bed, her back against the wall. in her hands is a paperback romance novel that she is looking over the top of, staring intensely across the room. we can hear rath, his breathing deep and even. he is doing tai chi, wearing only his boxer shorts. his body is coated in a sheen of sweat, his muscles strained as he moves fluidly through space. electra begins to breath with him. she moves her body slightly, her hips rising as though to meet his. he empties his lungs entirely in one exhale and stops, his eyes closed, rested.}

<D>__{i'm going to shower. if you're hungry, go ahead and order some dinner.}
<A>__{electra nods again.}
