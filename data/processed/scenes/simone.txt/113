<L>__{exterior viktor's malibu house beach day}
<A>__{viktor, deep in thought, stands at the water's edge, staring at the breaking waves. lainey joins him.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{hey, lainey.}
<P>__{(gently teasing her)}
<D>__{how's your love life?}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{i do okay. how about you?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{you know me married to my work.}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{i noticed.}
<A>__{an awkward silence.}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{dad, you know i don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now. she broke up with kent.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(buoyed by the news)}
<D>__{really? too bad.}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{she thinks you're with simone.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{lainey, you know simone and i don't have a real relationship.}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{i know but mom doesn't. maybe if it came from simone, if simone spoke to mom she could straighten things out.}
<P>__{(shrug)}
<D>__{dinner, maybe.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{dinner? dinner's difficult. a phone call?}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{too impersonal. they have to meet face to face.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{i will see what i can do.}
<P>__{(a thought occurs)}
<D>__{you know, lainey. i don't believe you've ever once asked to meet simone. don't you like her?}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{i love her but that doesn't mean i need to meet her.}
<A>__{viktor is confused.}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{why? so i can tell my friends at school as if that validates my life somehow. what's simone going to say to a fourteen year old anyhow? she's going to be polite because you're my father but we're not suddenly going to become friends we have nothing in common. it's not going to be real. anyhow, she gets more beautiful in my head every day. why kill the dream? what do they say, "don't get too close to your idols, they always disappoint you".}
<A>__{viktor gazes in wonder at his daughter, so much wiser than her years.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{i love you, lainey.}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{i love you too, daddy.}
<A>__{a car horn sounds outside the house.}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{that's mom.}
<P>__{(kissing him on the forehead)}
<D>__{see you.}
<A>__{she exits, leaving viktor deep in thought.}
