<L>__{ext city streets night}
<A>__{a series of quick cuts of joey's car tearing through the darkness heading back to her apartment.}
<L>__{interior corridor, joey's apt. bldg. night}
<A>__{joey rushes down the corridor to her apartment door, hurriedly turns the lock and rushes in.}
<L>__{interior main room, joey's apt. night}
<A>__{joey closes her door and switches on the light. the mood is suddenly different after the frenzied drive across town. it's very still, very slow, very quiet. perhaps it's too quiet: joey moves into the room slowly, clutching the box in her hands and glancing round. her manner makes the mood suddenly creepy. is the monster already in the house? very slowly, very carefully, joey begins to move round her apartment. hardly breathing, making no sudden movements, she checks her doors. the kitchen ... empty. the bedroom ... empty. the bathroom ... empty. joey stands back in the center of her main room, facing out to her big picture window. slowly, she lets out a big breath and then draws an equally slow one in. maybe it's alright ... maybe the monster isn't here ... maybe ... magically, eerily, slowly, the box begins to rise from joey's hand. her eyes stare in horror as it ascends through the air.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{oh shit ...}
<A>__{maybe there's one place she hasn't checked. swallowing nervously, joey tilts her head up and back, her eyes rising up in their sockets. the camera tilts low ... low ... lower ... taking in a wider view of the room and its ceiling and the ascending box ... and the audience screams! like a spider or a lizard, pinhead is flat against the ceiling, arms stretched out for balance, his face staring down at joey. joey throws her hands to her mouth and screams. pinhead, angling down feet first, floats elegantly to the floor to stand facing joey. the box lands in one of his outstretched hands. he holds it out to show joey ... and then suddenly closes his powerful hand on it, apparently crushing it. he flings the remnants from him and they land on joey's floor chunks and splinters of wood, whirring and spinning machinery of gold and silver, and scores of tiny writhing worms.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{watch.}
<A>__{thanks to the miracles of trick photography, the remnants suddenly come back together and reassemble themselves into the box which sits there intact on the floor.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{the box can't be destroyed. like pain or the poor, it is always with us. but as long as i have it, no one can open it. now come here and die. you have friends in hell waiting to greet you.}
<A>__{joey begins to back across the room toward her window.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{you'll have to come and get me, you ugly bastard.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{spirited. good. i will enjoy making you bleed. i will enjoy making you enjoy it.}
<A>__{pinhead starts across the room. joey looks at her window. it's the normal view ... with the normal seven story drop. pinhead closes. she bites her lip, goes for it: in a literal and metaphorical leap of faith she runs headlong at the window and jumps at it. the window shatters. pinhead's arm reaches out after joey as if to grab her and pull her back.}
<B>__{sidelong angle}
<A>__{ shows his arm entering the shattered window and also shows the night time cityscape beyond the window. what it doesn't show is the front of the monster's arm. that's somewhere else.}
