<L>__{exterior old trailer across from badlands sunrise}
<A>__{ray walks to the front door of a war torn trailer that is halfway swallowed by weeds and plants. it is static out here. dead still. ray approaches the front door. there is a huge hole in it. he knocks above the hole. after a moment, the door opens a crack. a dark, weather beaten face barely shows.}

<A>__{the door closes. locks.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{ dreamer.}
<A>__{ray stands there for a moment then lowers himself to look through the huge hole in the door.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{sir?}
<A>__{a tattered chair is pushed against the door, covering the hole. ray stands up, turns on the steps. and before he can let out a flustered sigh, he spots something across the dirt road. something that makes him remove his shades, look again. whatever it is, it doesn't make him happy, and he is hurrying across the road.}
