<A>__{pointing up to the huge family tree...}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{this is our family my way of coping with eternity. the labyrinth of life. the family teaches me the rhythms and passions of each age.}
<A>__{her finger trails down the great line to a name "jessica reeves"...}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{you are my most prized light. you are what keeps me connected to the world of the living.}

<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{when your parents died i took you to india to take care of you.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{and something happened there.}
<C>__{maharet}

<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{jesse, you must stay away from lestat. you must forget all about him.}
<A>__{jesse looks at her, surprised. maharet smiles.}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{yes, i know about your new friend. you think you love him, but it's not as you thought it would be.}
<A>__{jesse stares at maharet, surprised she understands so well.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i thought i was like him.}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{i know, but it is not who you are, not who you are meant to be. you have found that out now.}
<A>__{jesse sits on a stone bench, confused. maharet smiles sadly, feeling jesse's inner turmoil.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{lestat's all i can think about... i felt like i belonged with him. now i know why...}
<A>__{maharet sits beside her, speaks emphatically.}

<D>__{jesse, you must forget about him. you must trust me...}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(gazes up at her a long moment)}
<D>__{i missed you so much, aunt maharet.}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{me too.}
<A>__{just then the gloom of the pre dawn's light begins to illuminate the windows of the great hall.}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{you will go home to london in the morning.}
<A>__{jesse holds maharet's eyes.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{but this is my home. this is where i belong. why do you want to get rid of me so quickly?}
<A>__{maharet touches her face gently.}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{now is not the time to be here...}
<A>__{the light is getting brighter. maharet stands.}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{you were seeking answers. now you have found them. the family is who you are.}
<A>__{maharet goes to jesse, wraps her arms tight around jesse. despite the coldness of her skin, jesse warms to the embrace, closes her eyes, holds her tight. then, beaten by the sun, maharet stands, exits into the shadows, turns back to jesse, gazes at her.}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{you will go home to london tomorrow.}
