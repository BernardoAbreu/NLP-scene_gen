<L>__{interior main office day}
<A>__{he passes the chinese stocklady. she sees him and manages to look away. marvin exchanges a look with him but can't bring himself to talk. bud wonders...the whole office seems silent, the other brokers stealing glances. ...as he passes lou mannheim with charlie cushing, who ignores bud...}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{how's it going mr. mannheim? got out of bluestar in time i hope?}
<A>__{mannheim stops, winds up. bud impatient but polite.}

<P>__{(with gruff affection)}
<D>__{bud i like you, just remember something. man looks in the abyss, there's nothing staring back at him. at that time a man finds his character and that is what keeps him out of the abyss...}
<P>__{(a beat, looks deeply)}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i think i understand what you mean mr. mannheim.}
