<A>__{a standing ovation. the young pianist on the stage bows deeply, soaking up the applause of the audience. the pianist tosses one of his white gloves into the front row where it is caught by an adoring fan. the second glove he tosses up to the box where jerome and irene are standing. jerome snares the glove out of the air and immediately hands it to irene. she promptly slips the glove on her own hand. the glove fits snugly over her five fingers. however one finger of the glove remains unfilled. jerome is stunned to realize that it is a six fingered glove.}
