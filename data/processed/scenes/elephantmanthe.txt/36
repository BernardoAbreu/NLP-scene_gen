<A>__{dirt road night the intrepid freaks approach a bend in the road. they go around the corner and before them stands a small train station, a train sitting amongst the steam by a platform. the freaks stop just outside the light of the station and the plumed dwarf's instruction get merrick into his disguise. the female pinhead, who has carried his stick, hands it to merrick, squeezing his hand.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{thank you, my friends.}
<A>__{the plumed dwarf relays the message and the freaks respond to merrick in their language.}
<C>__{plumed dwarf}
<D>__{i will go in with you, you'll need a ticket.}
<A>__{he turns and confers with the freaks who all rifle through their pockets and produce some coins. then he and merrick walk into the station, the freaks watching and waving.}
<B>__{on the platform}
<A>__{the train is about to leave. at a barrier two ticket collectors are taking tickets of a few last minute passengers, who hurry off. the plumed dwarf and merrick appear and walk to the barrier. the plumed dwarf hands over the ticket.}
<C>__{plumed dwarf}
<D>__{i'm just going to help my friend on board.}
<A>__{they walk off down the platform. the collectors stare after them. the plumed dwarf, his arm around merrick, is helping him down the platform, as fast as possible, his ark trailing behind him. as they pass the windows of the first class carriages, we see the ornate interiors and the happy, handsome people on their plush seats. the plumed dwarf finds an empty compartment and opens the door.}
<C>__{plumed dwarf}
<D>__{this'll do.}
<A>__{he looks down the platform. the ticket collectors are watching them with great interest. merrick climbs laboriously aboard. the other people on board see merrick, react, and move away from him as far as they can in the cramped, 3rd class carriage. the plumed dwarf notices this and sniffs at the people with contempt.}
<C>__{plumed dwarf}
<D>__{i'm sorry i could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.}

<C>__{plumed dwarf}
<D>__{luck, my friend, luck. who needs it more than we?}
<A>__{merrick nods "yes", and holds out his hand. the train is moving a little faster. the plumed dwarf grabs his hand and they shake. he shuts the door. as the carriage passes, merrick's mask is pressed up against the window. the plumed dwarf waves to him as the train moves away. he looks at the train for a moment, then walks back down the platform. third class carriage interior merrick is in the corner, facing into the carriage. he looks slowly around. the other passengers have moved away, forming almost a moat of space around him. we see the whole carriage now; the cowering people and merrick at the far end. seeing their silent, horrified stares, he moves to the opposite seat, facing the back wall. merrick looks around for a moment, then sees his reflection in the window. he stares at himself.}
<B>__{third class carriage}
<A>__{the carriage is dark now, and empty except for merrick. he looks out the window at a sign above a station platform that says "oostende", and at the few people still walking about. oostende station platform (night) we see the side of the carriage. merrick, inside the darkened car, is not visible. a conductor walks to the end of the carriage and turns a valve. he opens the door to merrick's compartment.}
<C>__{conductor}
<D>__{i'm sorry, you'll have to leave now.}
<A>__{merrick is motionless, reluctant to leave the security of the darkness.}
<C>__{conductor}
<D>__{this is the end of the line, you'll have to leave now.}
<A>__{merrick pulls his walking stick from the darkness and plants it firmly on the floor with a loud thud. the conductor, expecting violence, draws back. a few people on the platform, who have stopped to watch this exchange, gasp. merrick rises with the help of his stick, and slowly descends from the carriage watched very carefully by the others. he looks around for a moment, then walks off down the platform. two young toughs follow a little distance behind him, laughing and mimicking his uneven gait. oostende quay (night) we see a short line of people waiting to board a cross channel steamer. the first mate is standing by the gangplank, smiling at the women passengers and making the most of his handsome face and crisp white uniform. he surveys the line, stops and smiles even more broadly. a very pretty young woman at the end of the line is smiling back. we see the end of the quay disappearing into darkness towards the station. the rhythmic sound of merrick's stick is heard as he slowly moves into the light. the woman, still smiling at the first mate, demurely lowers her eyes. merrick appears behind her, breathing heavily from the long walk. the woman's face freezes. she turns her head, ever so slightly, and sees merrick. her face drops. the first mate sees the woman change, then sees merrick. he walks out of frame. merrick is still trying to catch his breath as the first mate walks up. the woman looks up at the first mate imploringly.}
<D>__{first mate may i see your ticket?}
<A>__{merrick, confused at first, produces his ticket from his cloak. the first mate examines it and hands it back.}

<A>__{merrick remains motionless.}
<D>__{first mate you heard me. there's no room. now be off with you.}

<D>__{wait! one more!}
<A>__{he turns back and finally takes a look at the late arrival.}
<C>__{ticket taker}
<D>__{you'll have to hurr...}

<A>__{merrick is crouched in a dark corner underneath a stairway, his head resting on the points of both knees, his arms clasped around them. he is asleep. a few drops of rain fall and hit his cap, then a few more and finally it begins to rain. he wakes up and looks around. he hears a voice.}
<C>__{young woman }
<D>__{look! it's dover!}
<A>__{through the stairs we see a young couple in the rain at the railing, arm in arm. the young woman points. the young man turns to her and smiles.}

<D>__{finally! dover!}
<A>__{they laugh and hug each other and run inside out of the rain. merrick's hand comes into the shot, grasping a stair and pulling himself up slowly. he rounds the stairs and walks onto the deck looking after the young couple. merrick walks to the railing and leans over it, oblivious of the rain. we see the cliffs of dover. dockside dover the ship's gangplank leading down to a sea of umbrellas. passengers one by one come down the plank and are swallowed by the crowd. on the dock amidst the umbrellas, we see merrick. he looks around, then moves off into the crowd. the crowd moves past a sign saying, "to the trains". london train interior through a rain streaked window we see rolling green countryside. we pull back to see an elderly man in a heavy black overcoat with a wide brimmed rain hat eating an apple. beside him his wife knits. a few other people similarly clothed are sleeping. we pan across them to see merrick at the back of the car watching the elderly man eat. london train exterior the last car speeds down the track and disappears.}
<B>__{liverpool street station}
<A>__{grey light filters through the windows in the high canopy ceiling over the trains in the station. the platforms below fill with people as trains arrive and depart. we now see the station with its newsstands, sweetstalls, shoeshiners, and passengers moving to and fro, carrying luggage and looking for their train. a young boy is seated on a pile of baggage looking very adult and bored. his mother stands beside him, though we see only a portion of her billowy skirt. we hear her voice in rapid conversation with another woman. the young boy scans the crowd looking for excitement. he sees something. the elderly man we saw on the train and his wife are moving past the barrier. the young boy slowly pulls a peashooter from a pocket, puts a pea in his mouth, and raises the pipe to his lips. his mother's hand shoots out and grabs it.}

<C>__{little jim}
<D>__{now i will see you...}
<A>__{he lifts the hood and then staggers back onto the floor in a spasm of fear. he lets out a shrill scream. merrick turns wildly away, looking for another escape. little jim's mother, hearing her son's cries, looks up immediately. she sees merrick and the howling boy in the middle of the station.}

<D>__{my son! my son! help!}

<A>__{merrick stops at the sight of the bobby. the bobby at the arch, now aware of the commotion, sees merrick and walks quickly towards him. merrick changes course, but, a group of men, alerted by jim's mother's screams, move forward together, cutting him off. they yell at him angrily. one of them darts toward him and grabs a hold of merrick's hood. merrick turns frantically away and as he does, the hood is pulled off him. the crowd shouts at him as he goes, following him in wary pursuit. he moves back past the children and jim's mother. they all scream and shield themselves from his approach. another group of people move toward him blocking all escape. behind him, he sees a door to a urinal. he moves through it followed by the crowd. we hear fearsome echoes inside. inside the urinal, the crowd presses merrick toward a wall. they have become angry now. they shout and there is fear in their voices. they hem merrick in. he looks around hoping for an opening. there is none. he gives a strangled cry and collapses as the bobby pushes his way through the crowd. merrick puts his good hand over his good ear trying to block out the screams of the crowd.}
