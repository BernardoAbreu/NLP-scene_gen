<A>__{to a moving insert harpo bringing the horse to a stop in front of a farm house. he blows a blast on a regular army bugle... immediately a few old men rush out of the house in their nightgowns, carrying guns, and into the scene from all directions rush other men, answering the call, similarly attired. harpo starts his horse and we dissolve : to him pulling up to another farm house. this house has a single door on the extreme end of it and a very large french window covering almost the rest of the house. harpo stops and sounds the bugle call. this time there is no answer to his call. he waits a second, then turns his horse in the direction of the house and rides through the single door. after a short pause, the doors of the french window fly open and the horse runs out pulling a double bed which is on wheels. harpo is standing at the foot of the bed, braced against the bedpost, holding the reins. there is an old couple, man and woman, fast asleep in the bed (this couple might be the blase gentleman and young wife used by peter arno in his cartoons.) after riding a few feet harpo leaps from the bed onto the horse's back and rides off leaving the bed and its occupants on the road.}
