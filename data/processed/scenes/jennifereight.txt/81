<A>__{a slide door rolls open and berlin peers in. full of furniture and cardboard crates stenciled "trinity institute craft dept." worth the try but forget it. this bastard obviously has legit imate business at the institute. takes a last poke around with the light. spots something red. a cigarette butt caked in lip stick. but what's this white stuff? some kind of powder spills from a capsule crushed in the door rails. he picks it up for a look and gets a bad one from behind! "whatta you doing, mister?" berlin finds himself facing an irate looking woman in her 20's. a lot of red hair and freckles. but definitely more frightened than angry. his police department badge is an instant sedative. gives her some crap about thefts from vehicles round here. she should keep her doors locked. she smiles and thought they were.}
