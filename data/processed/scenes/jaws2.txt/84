<A>__{ellen is asleep under the covers, brody, still in his clothes from the night before, is sprawled on top; obviously he's stumbled upstairs sometime during the night. there's a noise down the hall, from mike's room. brody stirs, but doesn't wake up.}

<A>__{mike is holding a lamp that's almost fallen the noise we just heard. he's almost dressed, but not quite satisfied with his image in the mirror. he takes off his clean shirt, and checks a more comfortable, worn shirt. a brief sniff to make sure it's okay for another day, and he puts it on; he tiptoes to the hall, where a noise stops him in his tracks.}
