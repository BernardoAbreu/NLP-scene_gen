<D>__{ so in the third quarter we saw no signs of weakening. we're up 18 percent over last year's third quarter gross and, needless to say, that's a new record...}
<B>__{tracking}
<A>__{down the length of the board room table. executives line either side. we are approaching the man at the far end of the table, to whom the report is being directed. he is late middle aged, dressed expensively but conservatively, his attention smilingly fixed on the executive who drones on.}
<C>__{executive}
<D>__{...the competition continues to flag and we continue to take up the slack. market share in most divisions is increasing and we've opened seven new regional offices...}
<A>__{the track has ended in a closeup of the man at the end of the table, who still smiles benignantly at the droning executive. the smile is serene, almost otherwordly. this is waring hudsucker.}
<B>__{reporting executive}
<A>__{he drones on.}
<C>__{executive}
<D>__{...our international division has also shown vigorous upward movement in the past six months and we're looking at some exciting things in r&d...}
<A>__{the camera slowly pans off the droning executive as the big man's attention apparently wanders; we frame up on the picture window skyline of new york.}
<C>__{executive }
<D>__{sub franchising. don't talk to me about sub franchising; we're making so much money in sub franchising it isn't even funny.}

<B>__{experienced. wider}
<A>__{norville, sitting at a coffeeshop counter, sets the pencil down. his chin is sunk disconsolately into his palm. his hat is pushed back dejectedly on his head. he idly stirs his coffee with his spoon. he takes one last gulp of the coffee, then sets the cup down on the want ads, stands, and digs into his pocket for change, turning it inside out.}
<B>__{close on counter}
<A>__{as norville puts all his change on the counter. his hand hesitates; he takes a little of it back. he leaves frame. a waitress's hand enters from the far side of the counter. she clears away the saucer, then the cup which has been resting on the want ads. it leaves a perfect brown circle around one entry:}
<C>__{the future is now.}
<D>__{start building yours at hudsucker industries. low pay. long hours.}
<C>__{no experience necessary.}
<D>__{apply personnel, 285 madison avenue.}
<A>__{as we hear the coffeeshop door opening o.s., a draft wafts the sheet of newspaper off the counter and out of frame.}
<B>__{new york city skyline}
<A>__{again looking through the window as, o.s., the reporting executive drones on.}
<C>__{executive }
<D>__{...our owned and operateds are performing far above expectations both here and abroad, and the federal tax act of 1958 is giving us a swell writeoff on our plant and heavies...}
