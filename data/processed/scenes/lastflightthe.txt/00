<L>__{exterior battlefield night}
<A>__{on a freeze frame of a huge mortar on the edge of a dismal no man's land, surrounded by trees and overhanging branches. the distant roar of battle rumbles ominously. superimposed titles appear and hold for a moment. abruptly, the image springs to life. the gun fires deafeningly. the nearby branches shake violently. another set of titles appears. the image freezes again as a lone bugle plays a charge. again and again and again, the image moves, the gun discharges noisily, the image freezes and more sets of titles appear with every firing. on the last discharge, the trumpet fades and all hell breaks loose:}
<B>__{war montage}
<A>__{nothing but fast, brutal flash cuts of: cannon firing in all directions. massive explosions on the battlefield that light up the night. troops marching across a bridge as a shell hits the river below sending water towering into the sky. an entire cavalry division galloping hard over the battlefield, blazing mortar fire visible above them on the horizon. brief shots of the horses, their grim riders hanging on for dear life, their muscles flexing, hooves pounding the dirt. men yelling. faster and faster, more and more chaotic: mortar fire, explosions, smoke. a machine gunner fires. a soldier falls. infantrymen, rifles in hand, press through the haze. more machine gunning. more soldiers go down. a massive gun fires.}
