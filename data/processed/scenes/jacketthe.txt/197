<L>__{interior hallway, alpine grove, new year's eve, 1992}
<A>__{two pairs of legs walk down a corridor, darkened by the night, through the now familiar passage to the basement... starks is not restrained this time though we don't see who is walking down the hall with him. he runs his hand over his forehead and looks at it when he's done. still no cut. they slow down their pace as they round the corner, as starks appears dizzier and dizzier. he doesn't stop and the person beside him doesn't see how weak he is... until starks trips. in slow motion, we hear a distant, garbled voice call out...}
<C>__{distorted voice}
<D>__{no! wa...atch out!}
<A>__{but starks' head hits the glass case of the fire extinguisher on the wall, as it was destined to. in the terrific shower of glass, one piece cuts a neat, deep, fatal gash in starks' head. blood starts to flow. as starks' eyes struggle to regain their focus, we see the blurred, indiscernible face of the person leaning over him to see if he's all right. the details start to make sense, even to starks. this is the wound they said he died from.}
