<L>__{exterior titanic day}
<A>__{titanic steams toward us, in the dusk light, as if lit by the embers of a giant fire. as the ship looms, filling frame, we push in on the bow. jack is there, right at the apex of the bow railing, his favorite spot. he closes his eyes, letting the chill wind clear his head. jack hears her voice, behind him...}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{hello, jack. he turns and she is standing there.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{i changed my mind. he smiles at her, his eyes drinking her in. her cheeks are red with the chill wind, and her eyes sparkle. her hair blows wildly about her face.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{fabrizio said you might be up }
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{sssshh. come here. he puts his hands on her waist. as if he is going to kiss her.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{close your eyes. she does, and he turns her to face forward, the way the ship is going. he presses her gently to the rail, standing right behind her. then he takes her two hands and raises them until she is standing with her arms outstetched on each side. rose is going along with him. when he lowers his hands, her arms stay up... like wings.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{okay. open them. rose gasps. there is nothing in her field of vision but water. it's like there is no ship under them at all, just the two of them soaring. the atlantic unrolls toward her, a hammered copper shield under a dusk sky. there is only the wind, and the hiss of the water 50 feel below.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{i'm flying! she leans forward, arching her back. he puts his hands on her waist to steady her.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(singing softly)}
<A>__{come josephine in my flying machine... rose cleses her eyes, feeling herself floating weightless far above the sea. she smiles dreamily, then leans back, gently pressing her back against his chest. he pushes forward slightly against her. slowly he raises his hands, arms outstretched, and they meet hers... fingertips gently touching. then their fingers intertwine. moving slowly, their fingers caress through and around each other like the bodies of two lovers. jack tips his face forward into her blowing hair, letting the scent of her wash over him, until his cheek is agianst her ear. rose turns her head until her lips are near his. she lowers her arms, turning further, until she finds his mouth with hers. he wraps his arms around her from behind, and they kiss like this with her head turned and tilted back, surrendering to him, to the emotion, to the inevitable. they kiss, slowly and tremulously, and then with building passion. jack and the ship seem to merge into one force of power and optimism, lifting her, buoying her forward on a magical journey, soaring onward into a night without fear.}
