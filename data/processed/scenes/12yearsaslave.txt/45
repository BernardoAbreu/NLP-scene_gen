<A>__{the slaves are asleep. a sailor descends the ladder approaching eliza. he bends down and attempts to wake the daughter by caressing her face. solomon rouses, and looks across to witness the scene. from his vantage point, we see eliza stand to interrupt the sailor. the sailor looks at eliza, eliza looks back at him. knowingly she leads him off into a corner of the hold. as she does so, eliza passes robert who jumps up to stand between eliza and the sailor. stretching out a firm hand to the sailor’s shoulder, robert’s look says “no you don’t.” clemens ray is awake now, watching. there is an odd moment of stillness between the sailor and robert, an impasse. we focus on the sailor’s face. slowly, a greasy smile erupts upon it. back now to robert’s face, a look of incomprehension. robert looks down. we follow his gaze to the knife that has already been jabbed unseen between robert’s ribs. the sailor withdraws the bloody blade. a wide shot of the two men. robert collapses to the floor like a sack of potatoes. clemens ray and solomon react. complete horror.}
