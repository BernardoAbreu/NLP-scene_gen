<A>__{travis follows wizard out onto the sidewalk. travis follows wizard as he walks toward his cab. he has something on his mind, something he wants to talk to wizard about.}
<C>__{travis}
<P>__{(walking)}
<D>__{hey wiz.}
<A>__{wizard leans back against the cab. travis is about to speak when he spots a group of black and puerto rican street punks, ages 12 15, jiving down the sidewalk toward him. one tosses a spray paint can around his back, basketball style. another mocks as if he's going to scratch a key along one of the cabs. wizard has no visible reaction. a flash of controlled anger crosses travis' face. he stares at the boy with the poised key. it is the same look that crossed his face in the harlem deli. we are reminded with a jolt that the killer lies just beneath travis' surface. the black punk must instinctively realize this too, because he makes a cocky show of putting the key back into his pocket and be bopping around travis and wizard. the young mean streeters continue down the street and travis turns back to wizard. across the street, in the background, a junkie nestles in a doorway.}

<P>__{(hesitant)}

<C>__{wizard}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...}
<C>__{wizard}

<C>__{travis}
<D>__{i wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.}
<C>__{wizard}
<D>__{shoot. they don't call me the wizard for nothing.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{well, i just, you know...}
<C>__{wizard}
<D>__{things got ya down?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{real down.}
<C>__{wizard}
<D>__{it happens.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{sometimes it gets so i just don't know what i'm gonna do. i get some real crazy ideas, you know? just go out and do somethin.}
<C>__{wizard}

<C>__{travis}
<D>__{like do anything, you know.}
<C>__{wizard}
<D>__{travis, look, i dig it. let me explain. you choose a certain way of life. you live it. it becomes what you are. i've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. still don't own my own cab. i guess that's the way i want it. you see, that must be what i am.}
<A>__{a police car stops across the street. two patrolmen get out and roust the junkie from his doorway.}
<C>__{wizard}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. it becomes what he is. why fight it? what do you know? how long you been a hack, a couple months? you're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.}
<C>__{travis}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{that's just about the dumbest thing i ever heard, wizard.}
<C>__{wizard}
<D>__{what do you expect, bertrand russell? i've been a cabbie all my life, what do i know?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i don't even know what you're talking about.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{neither do i, i guess.}
<C>__{wizard}
<D>__{you fit in. it's lonely, it's rough at first. but you fit in. you got no choice.}
<C>__{wizard}
<D>__{yeah. sorry, wizard.}
<C>__{wizard}
<D>__{don't worry, killer. you'll be all right.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i seen enough to know.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{wizard gives travis a short wave implying, "chin up, old boy," and walks around to the driver's side of his cab. wizard drives off, leaving the street to its natural inhabitants.}
