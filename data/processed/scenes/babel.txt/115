<D>__{shh, shut up.}
<C>__{newscaster }
<D>__{although authorities say it could have been a foiled robbery, the american government claims they are certain it was a terrorist attack. minister hassef hazal has said that in our country, terrorist cells have been eradicated, that morocco is a peaceful country and that one act of vulgar banditry followed by superficial evaluations such as the u.s. intends to place upon it cannot ruin the image, the economy and the pacifist reputation of our country. american ambassador ken jones, however, insists that it was a terrorist attack on american citizens, that it merits a full investigation, and that the guilty should be punished. so far, the attack has not been attributed to any known terrorist organizations... mohammed shouts.}
