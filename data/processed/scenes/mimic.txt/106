<L>__{interior tunnels}
<A>__{susan staggers through a dark passageway. water drizzles into her grimy face. she looks up. rain leaks from an overhead grate three stories up. she can see the shoes of people walking to and fro above.}

<L>__{exterior street above night}
<A>__{life as usual on delancey street. pedestrians crisscross the metal grate, hunched under their umbrellas. traffic noise, t.v. displays on street front stores, boom boxes, car horns... they drown out the tiny sound of susan's voice...}
<B>__{susan}
<A>__{hears distant feet scurrying toward her, punctuated by a metallic clang! clang! clang!}
<B>__{side tunnel}
<A>__{clang! the metal pipe, still imbedded in the mimic, bangs the wall as the insect moves down the dripping narrow tunnel.}
<B>__{susan}
<A>__{looks around frantically. she crosses to a metal lid on the floor, lifts it. a hole is below, dropping off into darkness. the mimic's clanging grows louder. susan sits herself on the edge of the hole, grasping the metal lid by handles on its underside. the mimic rushes into the chamber, speeding toward her... susan jumps into the hole, hanging onto the lid... whang! the lid slams shut over the hole a fraction of a second before the creature reaches it. the mimic touches the lid with its antennae, confused.}
