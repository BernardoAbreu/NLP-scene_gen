<A>__{marion envelopes the sobbing wisp of a girl, holding her, letting her cry, fighting his own tears... he reins back the horse, stopping in front of the others... he pleadingly looks to charlotte who steps up to the horse... to take susan... marion gives susan a final embrace, and covers her face with kisses...}

<D>__{i will come back... i promise...}
<A>__{marion hands the still crying susan down to charlotte... marion, in agony, averts his eyes, yanks his reins, and spurs his horse... as he rides away the children take off after him, running. susan seeing the others running after marion, struggles out of charlotte's arms, and runs after them as well... marion rides, now joined by gabriel, faster and faster, leaving a trail of dust... the children slow, then stop, one after another, watching as they ride away.}
