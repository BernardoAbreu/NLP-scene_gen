<A>__{harry has slid off the horse to get next to the control panel. he can look up at an angle and see malik in the car above him. his thumb hovers over the emergency stop button. if malik gets out at any floor, harry will have a moment to react and stop. malik can look down and see this. he knows harry's got him. he just keeps going, floor after floor, using the time to think. the older woman is still just staring, trying not to breathe. the horse flicks her in the face with his tail.}
