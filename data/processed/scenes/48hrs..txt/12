<A>__{first light breaks over telegraph hill. a quiet row of victorian townhouses now converted into apartments. apartment bedroom early morning cates is sprawled across the double bed; elaine is on the verge of falling off the edge. cates' eyes snap open. a second later, his wrist watch alarm goes off. he turns it off, gets out of bed and begins pulling on his pants. elaine sits up in bed, still wearing cates' blue shirt... cates picks up a robe as elaine gets out of bed on the opposite side, throws the robe to elaine... she takes off the shirt, swaps it for the robe and throws the shirt to jack.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{you know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.}

<D>__{maybe i got a fairly crummy day ahead.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{maybe that makes a nice excuse.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.}
<A>__{cates picks his holstered .44 off a chair back and begins strapping it on.}
<C>__{elaine}

<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i don't have time for this. i gotta go to work.}
<A>__{she stands frozen... he turns back and looks at her; it's hard to apologize.}
