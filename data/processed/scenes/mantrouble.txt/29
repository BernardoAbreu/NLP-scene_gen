<A>__{they move forward a few feet, when harry, now slightly behind joan, makes a covert hand signal in the direction of some trees several yards ahead of them. june, in a padded attack suit, suddenly jumps out from behind the trees, assuming an aggressive stance and emitting a repertory of menacing sounds.}

<D>__{duke, aus!}
<A>__{the dog instantly assumes a sitting position. joan, out of breath and exhilarated with fear and excitement, turns to harry:}
