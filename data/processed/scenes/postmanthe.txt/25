<L>__{interior general bethlehem's tent day}
<A>__{bethlehem stands before a painter's easel, palette in hand. he's got a mirror set up so he can see his reflection. he's doing a self portrait in the tradition of the great dutch masters but it's a dismal failure. he continues painting even as idaho leads the postman in. idaho salutes, steps back. for a moment, the postman doesn't quite know what to do.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<P>__{(re: the book and}
<D>__{binoculars on the}
<P>__{table)}
<D>__{they're yours. a solitary man, aren't you? binoculars. to watch life from a distance. and shakespeare. to read about it instead of living it.}
<A>__{bethlehem wants an answer. the postman clears his throat.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{no offense, general, but you seem to have read some shakespeare yourself.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{if he wishes to rise above mere thuggery, a military commandeer must be classically educated. philosophy, history. even a sense of the dramatic.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{do you know what i did before the war? do you think i was in the army? i sold copying machines. i was a salesman. the talent to lead men and devise and execute a battle plan were locked away inside me.}
<A>__{he picks up finding a way to win by nathan holn. a 20 year old self help book.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{if nathan holn hadn't come along, i'd still be selling copying machines. can you imagine the wasted life? can you imagine the magnitude of it? but war... war gives men like me a chance.}
<A>__{he turns to a dog eared page in the book.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{here... 'the prize is often left unclaimed. have the courage to grasp it. for fortune always favors the bold.'}
<P>__{(moved)}
<D>__{it always inspires me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i have a design for the future. a master plan. i will need able officers to carry it out. you have the intelligence. if your heart matches, you'll go far.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{we'll talk more in the weeks to come. dismissed.}
<A>__{the postman leaves. idaho stands at the ready.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{issue the binoculars to a scout.}
<C>__{idaho}
<D>__{and the book, sir?}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{burn it.}
<A>__{idaho leaves. bethlehem goes back to his painting. he considers himself in the mirror. after a long stare down, he shouts:}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{quit moving.}
