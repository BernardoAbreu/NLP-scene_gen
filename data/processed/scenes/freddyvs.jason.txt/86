<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{...merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily... life is but a dream.}
<A>__{in the back seat, erwin is nuzzled between stormie's breasts, sucking his thumb. both are fast asleep. jesse stares at the road ahead, his own eyelids drooping. the car starts to weave. angle out windshield we flash past freddy holding a cardboard sign by the side of the road: will kill}
<B>__{for food.}
<A>__{jesse shakes his head nah! he tries to concentrate on the road, his eyelids falling once more. jesse's car zooms past a billboard. behind the bill board a highway patrol car, a radar gun sticking out of the driver's window. close on radar gun as jesse's car passes in the back ground, the red digits cascading up. freddy, now dressed as a highway patrolman, sits behind the wheel. the radar gun's display is reflected in his mirrored shades. it reads: kill them.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{shouldn't dream and drive.}
<A>__{freddy starts the car and pulls out, but what comes out from behind the billboard isn't a patrol car it's freddy's nightmaremobile big chrome pipes belching hellfire. angle in jesse's rearview mirror as jesse's eyelids close and his head nods forward, revealing the night maremobile closing from behind fast. the nightmaremobile runs up to the back of jesse's car just an inch from the bumper. freddy moves one of the dozen of levers on the dash. close on freddy's hood ornament a small version of freddy's glove. it extends out towards the back of jesse's car, one of the tiny knives inserting into the trunk lock and turning with a slight click. the trunk lid opens. angle inside trunk the plastic bags with jason's remains are moving! freddy works another level and the tiny glove slits each bag. the various pieces of jason (hands, boots, intestines, etc.) crawl out of the bag.}

<D>__{looks like the cat's out of the bag now!}
<A>__{freddy laughs as the tiny hand closes the trunk. the nightmaremobile pulls out from behind jesse's car, banging into the rear quarter panel. wham! all four occupants of the car are jolted awake, startled. meagan looks out her window and sees the nightmaremobile as it closes in again.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{it's freddy!}
<A>__{wham! sparks fly. everyone screams. freddy laughs as he falls back for another shot. meagan sees the dozens of lost souls trapped in the back of the night maremobile, staring out at her through the back window. a small yellow sign reads: lost souls on board. jesse fights to keep the car on the road when suddenly, the pieces of jason attack, bursting from behind the back seat. one hand crawls up the back of the front seat, leaping onto jesse's throat. jason's intestines explode out of the backseat, slithering and snaking their way around stormie and erwin. one of jason's boots wiggles under the seat, making it's way towards the gas peddle. the other boot is content to lay under the back window and kick erwin in the head. as meagan fights to pull jason's hand of jesse's face, she looks down and sees jason's other hand between her legs. meagan screams. jason's boot stomps on the gas and jesse's car lurches forward with the acceleration. the nightmaremobile slams into the side of jesse's car again, causing it to swerve violently from side to side. inside the nightmaremobile, freddy pulls another lever. close on the nightmaremobile fender as a panel opens up and a circular sawblade arm extends out, cutting into jesse's car with a flurry of sparks. inside, meagan screams as the saw blade just misses her leg, cutting forward towards... close on jesse's front tire as the saw blade cuts into it. the tire blows and jesse's car lurches off the road, veering into a tree line. crash! jesse's car plows fender first into a tree, the horn stuck on, blaring. freddy laughs and kicks the nightmaremobile into overdrive, roaring off and disappearing with an explosion of fire that wisps away in an instant. in the distance an old farmhouse. the lights go on inside. the passenger door opens and meagan falls out onto the ground, bleeding from a slight scalp wound. a rear door opens and stormie and erwin spill out, locked in embrace and not seriously hurt. meagan staggers around to the driver's side and opens the door. jesse is laying unconscious against the steering wheel. meagan pulls him off the wheel and the horn stops. jesse is splattered with blood and his leg is a mess.}
<C>__{meagan}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{jesse's hurt real bad... we've got to get him to a doctor.}
<A>__{through the farmhouse window, erwin and stormie see the farmer on the phone.}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{don't worry... an ambulance is on the way.}
<A>__{meagan cradles jesse's head in her hands, crying:}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{oh, god... jesse...}
<A>__{erwin goes to the trunk and opens it. inside the garbage bags with jason's remains still inside untouched. erwin goes to meagan and says:}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{meagan... listen to me... the cops are on their way. if they find me and jason voorhees in the trunk there, we're finished.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{go... get out of here. take jason and stormie with you.}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{i'm staying with you.}
<A>__{erwin grabs the trash bags out of the trunk and says:}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{i will call you at the hospital.}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{somehow!}
<A>__{erwin takes off, disappearing with jason's remains into the night as sirens wail in the distance growing close.}
