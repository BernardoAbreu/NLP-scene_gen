<L>__{interior limousine night continuous}
<A>__{we see mulder in the back seat, reflected in the rear view mirror. where we also see the eyes of the driver watching him. mulder is handed the felt envelope by the w.m.m.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{what is it? well manicured man a weak vaccine against the virus agent scully has been infected with. it must be administered with ninety six hours.}
<C>__{mulder}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you're lying. well manicured man no. though i have no way to prove otherwise. the virus is extraterrestrial. we know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.}
<C>__{mulder}
<P>__{(dubious, to say the least)}
<D>__{a virus? well manicured man a simple, unstoppable lifeform. what is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. and attacks.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{this is what you've been conspiring to conceal? a disease? well manicured man no! for god sake you've got it all backwards.}
<A>__{this outburst comes suddenly, unexpectedly.}
<D>__{well manicured man aids, the ebola virus on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. this virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{what do you mean, walked? well manicured man your aliens, agent mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last ice age. in the form of an evolved pathogen. waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. using us as hosts. against this we have no defense. nothing but a weak vaccine.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{do you see why it was kept secret? why even the best men men like your father could not let the truth be known?}
<A>__{the force and conviction of his delivery leave mulder shaken.}
<D>__{well manicured man until dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. that mass infection would make us a slave race.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{that's why you bombed the building. the infected firemen, the boy well manicured man imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. my group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. to give us access to the virus. in false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. so that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{your father wisely refused to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. hope is the only future he had: his children,}
<P>__{(beat, then self revealing)}
<D>__{the only future any of us have.}
<A>__{this draws a look back in the mirror from the driver.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{but... he sacrificed his own daughter. my sister, samantha. well manicured man the only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human alien hybrids. your father arranged for your sister's abduction. he allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. as a clone.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he had different hopes for you. that you would uncover the truth about the project. that you would stop it. that you would fight the future.}
<A>__{mulder sits stunned by this. as if somehow his destiny has been validated, if not pre ordained. or maybe just justified.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{why are you telling me this? well manicured man i thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{what happened to kurtzweil? well manicured man as your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{where is he? well manicured man dr. kurtzweil is in the trunk.}
<A>__{mulder stares at the w.m.m., at his cold blooded expression.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{let me out. stop the car. well manicured man}
<P>__{(motioning)}
<D>__{driver.}
<A>__{mulder reaching to this as the limo pulls to a stop. trying the door, but the door is locked. when he turns back to the w.m.m. he has produced a handgun, which is now pointing at mulder. laid casually across a folded arm. mulder reacts on seeing it.}
<D>__{well manicured man the men i work with will stop at nothing to clear the way for what they believe is their stake in the inevitable future. i was ordered to kill kurtzweil. a necessary action to protect my grandchildren's lives.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i might just as easily kill you.}
<A>__{mulder is recoiling as he says this. then, without hesitation in one quick move, he shoots the driver in the head. the blood spattering on the front windshield and on mulder who has barely had a chance to react.}
<D>__{well manicured man trust no one, mr. mulder.}
<A>__{mulder looks at the well manicured man, expecting to be nexterior and for a moment, we do too. but the w.m.m. simply opens the door and steps out of the car. holding the door open for mulder who is still frozen by the actions that went just before.}
