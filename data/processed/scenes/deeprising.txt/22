<L>__{exterior shinkai 9000 night}
<A>__{everything outside the plexi dome is still black. everyone is staring at the position board, which shows a large section of the ocean floor starting to move, its contours incongruous with the rest of the graphic representation. the science officers look stunned. the captain barks commands. the crew leaps into high gear. then the captain reverses the trottle, and petal to the metal he starts to back out. the inky blood swirls past the plexi dome. then suddenly, and impossibly, the submersible jerks to a halt. everybody goes ass over teacups. equipment shatters. sparks fly. glass breaks. lots of yelling in japanese. the shinkai starts to rock and shake. something has a hold on it. more equipment shatters. men are thrown about. then it stops rocking. the sailors stop yelling. everything goes dead quiet. frightened eyes share terror filled looks. a sound is heard coming from the exterior of the ship, like feet runing across the outside of the hull. very creepy. the hull starts to moan and creak from an unseen pressure. and then the sub begins to be crushed like it's a beer can. the metal hull torques on all sides. rivets pop and snap. water sprays and shoots. more sparks fly. the steel plating dimples, crumbles and screams in agony. chaos. pandemonium. and then the shinkai implodes. a massive churning swirl of water, metal and men.}
