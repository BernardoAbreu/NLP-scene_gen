<A>__{angle on tv screen a video image of a lab monkey, convulsing pathetically, a victim of shocks from the numerous wires attached to his tiny, restrained body. angle on cole, sitting, writing intensely in a magazine with crayon, surrounded by dull eyed patients in pajamas and ratty robes, staring at the shuddering lab monkey on the tv screen.}
