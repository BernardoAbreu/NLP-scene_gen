<L>__{exterior the courtroom day}
<A>__{kaffee is at the end of his examination of downey.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{private, i want you to tell us one last time: why did you go into private santiago's room on the night of august 6th?}
<C>__{downey}
<D>__{a code red was ordered by my platoon commander, lt. jonathan james kendrick.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(to ross)}
<D>__{your witness.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{private, for the week of 2 august, the switch log has you down at post 39, is that correct?}
<C>__{downey}
<D>__{i'm sure it is, sir, they keep that log pretty good.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{how far is it from post 39 to the windward barracks?}
<C>__{downey}
<D>__{it's a ways, sir, it's a hike.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{about how far by jeep?}
<C>__{downey}
<D>__{about ten, fifteen minutes, sir.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{have you ever had to walk it?}
<C>__{downey}
<D>__{yes sir. that day, sir. friday. the pick up private sir, that's what we call the fella who drops us at our posts and picks us up... also, 'cause he can get girls in new york city the pick up private got a flat...}
<A>__{at the defense table, kaffee, poker faced, scribbles something down on a piece of paper and slides it to jo. jo looks at it: "where's he going with this?" jo scribbles "?" and hands it back to kaffee.}
<C>__{downey}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...right at 39. he pulled up and blam! ...a blowout with no spare. the two of us had to double time it back to the barracks.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{and if it's ten or fifteen minutes by jeep, i'm guessing it must be a good hour by foot, am i right?}
<C>__{downey}
<D>__{pick up and me did it in 45 flat, sir.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{not bad. now you say your assault on private santiago was the result of an order that lt. kendrick gave in your barracks room at 16:20.}
<A>__{kaffee knows what's coming. there's nothing he can do about it. and he can't lose his cool in front of the jury.}
<C>__{downey}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<A>__{jo. helpless. panicked.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{but you just said that you didn't make it back to windward barracks until 16:45.}
<A>__{downey's confused. these are questions he hasn't been asked before.}
<C>__{downey}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{if you didn't make it back to your barracks until 16:45, then how could you be in your room at 16:20?}
<C>__{downey}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you see sir, there was a flat tire.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{private, did you ever actually hear lt. kendrick order a code red?}
<A>__{kaffee's world is falling down around him, and there's nothing he can do about it. and he knows it.}
<C>__{downey}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<A>__{jo leaps to her feet.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{please the court, i'd like to request a recess in order to confer with my client.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{why did you go into santiago's room?}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{the witness has rights.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{the witness has been read his rights, commander.}
<C>__{downey}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{hal?}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{the question will be repeated.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{why did you go into santiago's room?}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{your honor }
<C>__{downey}
<D>__{hal?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{did corporal dawson tell you to do it?}
<A>__{everyone is frozen.}
<C>__{ross}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{he did, didn't he? dawson told you to give santiago a code red.}
<A>__{downey looks at dawson.}
<C>__{downey}
<D>__{hal?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{don't look at him.}
<C>__{downey}
<D>__{hal?}
<C>__{dawson}
<D>__{private. answer the lieutenant's question.}
<A>__{the room is still silent. downey does something we've never seen him do before. he straightens himself up and says this with the pride of a man who believes he's done the right thing.}
<C>__{downey}
<D>__{yes, lieutenant. i was given an order by my squad leader, lance corporal harold w. dawson of the u.s. marine corps. and i followed it.}
<A>__{ross let's it hang. he looks over at kaffee. kaffee won't meet his eyes.}
