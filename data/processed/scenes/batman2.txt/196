<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i brought you a christmas present. sorry about the wrapping the police made me open it.}
<A>__{tiptree opens the box and pulls out a diamond studded tie clasp. he looks up at bruce with an odd mixture of bewilderment and gratitude. bruce nods for him to try it on, and he obliges...}
<C>__{tiptree}
<D>__{...i'm afraid i don't have anything for you.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i think you may have something that belonged to my father.}
<C>__{tiptree}
<D>__{ you know?}
<A>__{he stares at bruce, astonished. his head sinks into his hands.}
<C>__{tiptree }
<D>__{it'll all be over tomorrow. one way or another, it'll all be over.}
<P>__{(looking up; despondent)}
<D>__{i've decided, bruce. i'm gonna give him the last two ravens. he's already got the others.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{what are you talking about? who?}
<C>__{tiptree}
<D>__{batman. i don't know how he found out, but }
<A>__{tiptree reaches for the bottle on his desk to pour himself a drink, but bruce angrily knocks the glass out of his hands.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{it's time you told me what's going on here.}
<C>__{tiptree}
<D>__{didn't you ever wonder where it came from, bruce? all the privilege, all the power ...all the money?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the ravens are a...a kind of map, bruce. the key to an incredibly vast fortune.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{whose fortune?}
<C>__{tiptree}
<D>__{gotham city's.}
<A>__{flashback processed footage (mos) the cobblestone streets of 19th century gotham. a massive explosion blows open one wall of a municipal building, and total chaos erupts: fires starting, bystanders screaming, police rushing to the scene...}
<C>__{tiptree}
<D>__{in 1880 the gotham city treasury was looted. it was a fantastic operation perfect military precision. the robbers made off with milllons in gold and silver bullion...}
<A>__{a horse drawn cart weighted down with gold bricks careens around a corner. atop it are two men in masks, firing a gatling gun into the crowd. police and onlookers tumble to the pavement, shot dead, as another cart emerges from the wreckage of the treasury and takes off in the opposite direction. flashback processed footage (mos) city officials in a boardroom trading papers back and forth, arguing furiously with five calm, distinguished looking gents one of whom is the bushy bearded civil war hero gen. oliver}
<B>__{wayne.}
<C>__{tiptree }
<D>__{the city was going under. bankrupt... until five rich men stepped in to bail it out. in exchange they took the land rights, the mineral rights, the service contracts }
<A>__{back to scene on bruce and tiptree}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{the five families.}
<C>__{tiptree}
<D>__{our ancestors. they bought gotham city carved it up and ran it into the ground. in five years they were rich beyond imagining.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{we've just been following in their footsteps. and in all this time no one's ever suspected }
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{ that they were the ones behind the robbery?}
<A>__{flashback processed footage (mos) the five patriarchs in front of a roaring fireplace at wayne manor, raising a celebratory toast. camera pans over to a nearby table; on it rest five raven statuettes.}
<C>__{tiptree }
<D>__{they had five ravens made. five ravens which combined would reveal the location of the treasure they'd stolen.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but they never touched it. they never needed to. it's still there to this day.}
<A>__{back to scene on bruce and tiptree}
<C>__{tiptree}
<D>__{the ravens, and the secret have been passed down through generations. father to son...}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{your father died before he could tell you.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{so they stole his piece of the puzzle.}
<C>__{tiptree}
<D>__{yeah. i've got it, bruce, and i'm going to hand it over. he's right, you know. we've all been feeding feeding on the soul of gotham...}
<A>__{bruce stares at him, stony faced. there's one part of the story that doesn't quite add up.}
<C>__{bruce }
<D>__{i don't believe you, elliott. my father was a decent man an honorable man. he would never have taken part in a scheme like this.}
<C>__{tiptree}
<D>__{it wasn't his doing, bruce. it was }
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{that doesn't matter. if he knew that his fortune was based on a crime a crime against the city...}
<P>__{(violently)}
<D>__{reputation or not, he would've tried to }
<C>__{tiptree}
<D>__{christ, bruce! do you want me to spell it out for you?!?}
<A>__{bruce backs off. an awful shiver of anticipation runs down his spine.}
<C>__{tiptree }
<D>__{he was a decent man. he was an honorable man. that's why they had him killed.}
<A>__{camera zeroes in on bruce's horrified face as we get a}
<B>__{series of shots}
<A>__{quick, almost subliminal glimpses of bruce's primal trauma: a mugger snatching at his mother's necklace. thomas wayne lunging at him. the young jack napier firing at thomas. pearls showering down on the rain drenched sidewalk. a second bullet felling his mother and finally, young bruce himself, face wracked with pain and grief back to scene on bruce an expression which perfectly matches the one which the adult bruce is wearing as he relives it all thirty years later. staggered and glassy eyed, he stares off into space as tiptree finishes his tale.}
<C>__{tiptree}
<D>__{they killed him...to protect their secret ...and now the bill's come due. now the bill's come due.}
