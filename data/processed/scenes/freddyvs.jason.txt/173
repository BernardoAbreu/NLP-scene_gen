<A>__{the ceiling collapses in on jason, burying him under a ton of rubble and the big antenna dish. a ton of dust billows up. just then, murdoch bursts in. he sees lizzy and meagan and takes aim with the shotgun. erwin sees this and jumps in between them, yelling:}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{no! wait!}
<A>__{murdoch fires. the shotgun blast knocks erwin across the room, where he lands in a heap. meagan and lizzy run to his side. erwin struggles to breathe a large hole in his chest. with fading strength, erwin pulls his pin out and pricks himself. erwin smiles and dies.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{erwin? erwin?!}
<C>__{murdoch}
<D>__{he's dead... and so are you if you don't put your hands up right now!}
<A>__{lizzy turns and attacks murdoch. he knocks her to the floor, taking aim on her head with the shotgun as he says:}
<C>__{murdoch}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it's time i taught you girls some respect for the law!}
<A>__{in a panic, meagan snatches up a pistol from a fallen cultist and fires it at murdoch's head. ptt twang! murdoch's hat goes flying off with a spark hit, revealing his bald, hideous head a large open wound with a metal plate underneath. he turns towards meagan with an evil grin on his face.}
<C>__{murdoch}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{so... you wanna be a punk?}
<A>__{murdoch raises the shotgun, taking aim on meagan.}
<C>__{murdoch}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{then die like a punk!}
<A>__{murdoch starts to squeeze the trigger when jason's hand shoots out of the rubble pile behind him. jason jams his hand down the back of murdoch's pants and pulls up his briefs, lifting him a foot off the floor with a jason wedgy as he rises from the rubble. we see murdoch's name written into his shorts. as murdoch screams, jason jerks the shotgun from his hand and jams it up his ass right through the seat of his pants. murdoch's cheeks bulge out as the muzzle slams into the roof of his mouth. jason cocks the shotgun and... boom! murdoch's head and shoulders explode from his torso, leaving his broken spine sticking up out of shirt. bits of murdoch splatter the floor as his metal plate comes pinging down, rolling around and spinning to a stop like a hubcap. jason drops murdoch (what's left of him) to the floor just as the s.w.a.t. commander and his men come charging in. they see jason and raise their guns in panic.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{too late. the cops let loose with a barrage of gun fire. bullet hits explode on jason's chest. meagan grabs lizzy and covers her up as the bullets whizz past. more cops hear the shooting and come running. they start shooting too. soon the doorway to the studio is crowded with muzzle flash. more and more bullet hits smack jason. a bullet hole outline appears on the wall behind him. the cops start running out of ammo and a cry goes up, "more ammo! more ammo!". various inserts of cops going for hideout pistols, opening their trunks and taking out ammo cans, passing the weapons and ammo up the staircase to the cops in the studio. jason keeps getting shot. pieces of his are flying off. fingers shot off of a hand. a knee shot away to reveal the bone. dozens of bullet hits going off of his chest and head. finally, the cops start to run out of ammo. the shooting subsides and finally grinds to a stop, leaving the cops knee high in brass and a thick layer of gunsmoke in the room. as it clears, jason still stands. he teeters a little, then falls backwards with a mighty thud. jason lays dying. meagan rushes to his side. jason reaches into one of the giant holes in his chest and pulls something out jesse's heart. jason hands the heart to meagan. then jason's head rolls back he's dead. meagan begins weeping as we pull up out of the studio, revealing her surrounded by jason, freddy, and murdoch.}
