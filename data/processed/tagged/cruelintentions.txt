<L>__{exterior manhattan skyline day}
<A>__{we circle around the island of manhattan moving closer and closer till we're looking down on fifth avenue. as the melody continues to play we move towards a building and zoom into a window.}
<L>__{interior therapist's office day}
<A>__{a fifty year old female therapist (dr. greenbaum) sits at her desk, frowning as she takes notes. books of jung and freud line the shelves. a young man (sebastian valmont) sits in a chair in front of her looking impatient. the therapist continues to write notes.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{jesus. we've been at this for six months.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{and you haven't made an ounce of progress.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{sebastian takes out a cigarette.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<P>__{(not looking up)}
<D>__{there's no smoking in my office.}
<A>__{sebastian sneers at her then puts the cigarette away. dr. greenbaum finishes her notes and looks up at him, shaking her head.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{what do you want me to say? that i'm supposed to feel remorse because i act the way i do? the truth is i don't.}
<A>__{dr. greenbaum shakes her head and takes notes.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{look, i'm not like all the other kids in high school. i don't care about book reports and extra credit. teachers are idiots anyway. the only challenge out there for me is women. you see a girl you like. you pursue them. you conquer. you move on. it's exciting.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{but you said you have the worst reputation.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{don't you want to change that?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{let me tell you something, doctor. chicks love a guy with a bad rap. they say they don't, but they don't mean it. they all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." the trick is to let them think it's true.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{i think that's all the time we have for today.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{same time next week?}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{no. this is going to be our last session.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{why? i like spending time with you. you know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. you have killer legs. killer.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{this isn't a joke. your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. i'm trying to help you.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{don't be insecure, doc. you're a big help.}
<A>__{sebastian picks up a book of freud.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{he was a coke addict, you know.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{you think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. it doesn't work, sebastian.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{it works a little.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{no it doesn't. i see right through you.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{you do?}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{i hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. it's going to get you into trouble.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{well, you don't have to get nasty about it.}
<A>__{sebastian approaches a photo on her desk and picks it up.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{my daughter, rachel.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{yummy.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{don't even think about it. rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending princeton this fall. she's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{really? care to make a wager on that?}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{good luck, sebastian.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{what, nervous i'm going to win?}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{would you please leave.}
<A>__{sebastian puts on his glasses and leaves.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum }
<D>__{asshole.}
<A>__{the doctor stews for a moment, then reaches into her desk, sifts through some papers where she finds a pack of benson & hedges and lights one up. she looks at the photo of her daughter, then hits the speaker phone and dials.}

<D>__{honey, is something wrong?}
<A>__{rachel cries for a moment.}
<C>__{rachel}

<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{who told you?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you don't know him. i'm so stupid.}
<A>__{she continues to cry.}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.}

<D>__{nudie pictures, what do you think?}
<C>__{dr. greenbaum}
<D>__{jesus christ, how can you be so stupid?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i don't know. he was just so charming. all he did was talk about how i had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them. things just got out of hand from there.}
<P>__{(she hears the phone drop)}

<A>__{a enormous living room by manhattan standards, with a view that overlooks the park. eclectic art from around the world emphasize the valmont's passion for travel. sook hee, the valmont's housekeeper sets a tray of sushi in front of kathryn merteuil, a seventeen year old porcelain skinned wasp with all the grooming you could want in an east coast child. she sits with a forced smile on her face and listens attentively as bunny caldwell, a forty year old nouveau riche socialite talks incessantly. cecile caldwell, her beautiful teenage daughter, sits by her side. she wears a t shirt with a koala bear on it.}
<C>__{mrs. caldwell}
<D>__{i can't tell you how happy we are that cecile is going to be attending oakwood with you this fall. you've always been an inspiration to beau and i on raising her. we just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.}

<P>__{(takes out her crucifix)}
<D>__{turn to god and he helps me through the problem. call me an anachronism, but it works.}

<D>__{what are the boys like?}
<C>__{mrs. caldwell}
<D>__{cecile, is that the best you can do?}
<P>__{(to kathryn)}
<D>__{you must forgive her, kathryn. she's never been in a co educational atmosphere before.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{don't worry, it's totally understandable. most of the boys that matriculate at oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.}
<C>__{mrs. caldwell}
<D>__{like your step brother sebastian. i can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.}

<P>__{(imitating kathryn)}
<D>__{we'll get together and plan your curriculum.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{keep your friends close and your enemies closer. when i get through with her, she'll be the premier blow job queen of the tri state area and poor little court's heart will be shattered.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{why go through cecile? why not just attack court?}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{because if there's an attack made on court it could be traced back to me. i can't allow that to happen. everybody loves me and i intend to keep it that way.}

<D>__{i can't.}
<A>__{kathryn throws his hand off of hers.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{oh come on, kathryn. it's too easy. "but i thought high school was only four years." i mean, please. she knows nothing. she's seen nothing. i could have her under the table at au bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. i have a reputation to uphold.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{that was just simple revenge. what i have planned requires sheer genius.}
<A>__{he takes a magazine and throws it on the table. kathryn picks it up. it's the latest issue of "seventeen."}

<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{oh yes. i've read it over and over again. this baby's the real deal. daddy's little angel. a paradigm of chastity and virtue.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{b.f.d. what do you plan to do? fly to kansas and woo little dorothy.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{it just so happens we're not in kansas anymore. our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at oakwood. she's staying with my aunt up in connecticut while daddy sells his house. can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? it will be my greatest victory.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{you don't stand a chance. even this is out of your league.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{care to make a wager on that?}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{i will think about it...}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{oh well, duty calls. time to add another chapter to my work of art.}
<A>__{he holds up a leather bound journal.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{oh gee, your journal. could you be more queer?}
<C>__{sebastian}

<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{what makes you think i'd go for that bet? that's a seventy thousand dollar car.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{because i'm the only person you can't control and it kills you.}
<A>__{sebastian sneers at her.}
<C>__{kathryn }
<D>__{do we have a deal?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{no way, that car means everything to me.}
