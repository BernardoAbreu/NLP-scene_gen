<L>__{int studio night}
<A>__{holden enters. banky's still playing sega. holden sits next to him.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(off screen)}
<D>__{how bad do you suck!}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{how was your pseudo date?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{leave it alone.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{that chick bugs me.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(rubs his head; in baby talk)}
<D>__{aww. everyone bugs you.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{get off.}
<P>__{(off game)}
<D>__{fucking faggot! did you see that?! your dyke courting ass just got me scored on!}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know, you should watch that. if you're going to get all bent out of shape while playing the game, so much so that you need to curse the t.v., try not to gay bash it, alright. you're nor that kind of guy.}
<P>__{(gets up)}
<D>__{and don't call her a dyke, alright? she's a lesbian.}
<A>__{holden goes to his drawing table and takes off his coat. banky sits there, shocked. he puts the controller down and crosses to the drawing table.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{what the fuck is going on here?}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(pulling out pencil)}
<D>__{i'm starting a new page.}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(smacking pencil away)}
<D>__{not with this shit! with you. what the fuck is going on with you and that girl?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{we're friends.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{she's programming you.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i beg your pardon? programming?}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{yeah. and apparently, you don't even realize it. what does it matter if i refer to her as a dyke, or if i call the whalers a bunch of faggots in the privacy of my own office, far from the sensitive ears of the rest of the world?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{it's passive aggressive gay bashing; and i know you're not really prejudiced at heart. you should just find some other way to express your anger, is all i'm saying.}
<A>__{holden starts drawing. banky stares at him. then he grabs the pencil out of holden's hand and shoves him to the side. he starts drawing something.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{what the fuck are you doing!}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{bear with me here. i just want to put you through this little exercise.}
<P>__{(drawing feverishly)}
<D>__{okay, now see this? this is a four way road, okay?}
<A>__{banky draws a four way stop. he illustrates according to his voice over.}
<C>__{banky v.o.}
<D>__{and dead in the center, is a crisp, new, hundred dollar bill. now at the end of each of the streets, are four people, okay? you following? up here, we got a male affectionate, easy to get along with, no political agenda lesbian. okay? now down here, we have a man hating, angry as fuck, agenda of rage, bitter dyke. to this side, we got santa claus, right? and over to this side the easter bunny.}
<A>__{banky finishes drawing. holden's shaking his head}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{which one's going to get to the hundred dollar bill first?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{what is this supposed to prove?}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{i'm serious. this is a serious exercise. it's like an s.a.t. question. which one's going to get to the hundred dollar bill first the male friendly lesbian, the man hating dyke, santa claus, or the easter bunny?}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(beat; then pissed)}
<D>__{the man hating dyke.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{good. why?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(wildly crossing out the other three)}
<D>__{because these other three are figments of your fucking imagination!}
<A>__{holden storms away. banky follows.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i don't need this. i'm going home.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{she's fucking with your mind, man! she knows you've got this schoolboy crush and she's using it to sway your way of thinking!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{and why would she need to do that? what is she mata fucking hari?! what does she gain?}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{maybe she thinks you'll get her comic picked up by contender. or maybe she thinks you'll change the content of our book to something more political and message oriented. or, gee i don't know maybe because that's just what dykes like to do: fuck around with straight guys' heads, just so she can go back to her little rug muncher club and have a good laugh with all her man hating harpy cronies about how fucking stupid and easily duped men are!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you're so out of line right now..,}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{you don't even know this girl! big deal, she's from middletown and she went to north! all the girls at north were bitches and sluts anyway! and this one's got them beat by a mile because she's a bitch slut dyke!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{watch your fucking mouth, is all i'm going to tell you..}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{oh why? do you get my back when she bashes me? because i know she does. and do you know why she does? because i won't play her fucking game!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{sometimes your paranoia and suspicious bullshit is amusing. sometimes it's just fucking annoying as piss!}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{what is it about this girl? you know you have no shot at getting her into bed! why do you bother wasting time with her? because you're holden fucking mcneil most persistent traveller on the road that's not the path of least resistance! everything's gotta be a fucking challenge for you, and this little relationship with that bitch is a prime example of your fucking condition. well i don't need a fucking magic eight ball to look into your future; you want a forecast? here will holden ever fuck alyssa.}
<P>__{(shakes and looks at imaginary ball)}
<D>__{what a shock "not fucking likely"! this relationship of your's is affecting you, our work and our friendship, and the time's going to come when i throw down the gauntlet and say it's me or her! and then what're you going to say?!}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i think you should let this one go.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{no, what would you say? would you trash twenty years of friendship because you've got some idiotic notion that this chick would even let you sniff her panties, let alone fuck her?!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{let it go...}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{what the fuck.. what the fuck makes this bitch all that important?!?!}
<A>__{holden looks at banky for a long beat.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i'm in love with her, man.}
<A>__{banky stares at him. holden stares back. banky looks into holden's eyes. suddenly, he softens a bit. he drops his head.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{fuck.}
<A>__{banky walks away. holden watches him go and exits.}
