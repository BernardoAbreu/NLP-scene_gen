<D>__{good... very good... come on, just a few more steps...}
<A>__{cynthia blinks, as if just processing the therapist's word takes some adjustment.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(weary)}
<D>__{i... i can't... i have to rest...}
<C>__{berrisford's voice}
<D>__{young lady, you've had fifteen years of rest.}
<A>__{camera adjusts to show dr. berrisford. in his 50's, avuncular, he wears half framed glasses and a sweater vest under his medical coat. two pieces of tissue paper mark his razor's passage on his neck.}

<D>__{now walk to the end of that platform, or you won't got any chocolate ice cream.}
<A>__{something about berrisford's mock stern tone bores in on cynthia, gets a reaction. she gropes for an answer.}

<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{then walk to the end of the platform, or i will shove an entire gallon down your throat.}
<A>__{cynthia's eyes crinkle with confusion. and then, ah, she gets it! a joke, the first one in over a decade. she smiles, and it's a beautiful smile. setting her jaw, she makes a renewed effort and reaches the and of the platform. the therapist and berrisford both move quickly to catch her and set her down in a wheelchair.}
<C>__{berrisford}
<P>__{(to the therapist)}
<D>__{that'll be all.}
<A>__{berrisford begins wheeling cynthia along. they leave the therapy room, go down a corridor. (note: passage as per location.) as they go by other patients and staff, there's a general buzz as people whisper about cynthia.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(peering at berrisford)}
<D>__{am i supposed to know you or something?}
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{i've looked in on you from time to time... but that's hardly an introduction. you've been transferred into my care, cynthia. i'm doctor s. a. berrisford, consulting chief of neuropsychiatry and head of the berrisford clinic.}

<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{oh, forget all that. just call me what my staff does.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{god.}
<A>__{cynthia laughs. she likes this man's directness, the way he doesn't condescend to her.}
