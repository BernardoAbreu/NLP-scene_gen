<L>__{exterior planet's surface day}
<A>__{will and smith are walking down a forest path. the boy has a radiation tracker in his hand.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i've got a fix on dad's suit beacon.}
<A>__{dead ahead is a field of beautiful, alien flowers, their purple leaves moving in the wind like an azure sea.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{wow, that's mom's favorite color.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{how droll.}
<A>__{(over) a tremendous rumbling. the wind roars. suddenly, the air in the distance begins to twist, a rushing distortion sweeping towards them, flowers growing, landscape aging rapidly within.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{run, child, run.}
<A>__{smith turns, begins to flee, pulling will with him, away from the rushing warp. smith trips, falls, closes his eyes, waiting for the distortion to overtake him. a beat. he opens his eyes. smith pov. a glowing, stationary portal shimmers behind him, revealing beyond a forest ever older, darker, more overgrown.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{will? will?}
<A>__{no sign of the boy. then, from behind a tree, will appears.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{wow!}
<A>__{the field across the portal has is now a mass of giant plants, the flowers a deep red. will rushes across the rip in space.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{william, wait!}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{see, over here i'm in the future.}
<A>__{(steps back towards smith)}
<D>__{here i'm in the past. don't worry. if my theories are correct, these doorways should remain stable, for a while anyway.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{i can barely contain my glee. why aren't you aging like the plants?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that's just an effect of the portals forming. once they stabilize you can cross from one time to another just like stepping between two rooms.}
<P>__{(off his tracker)}
<D>__{dad's signal is this way. come on, doctor smith.}
<A>__{will takes smith's hand, pulls him across the threshold. smith pov. where he stands is now lush, the sky overhead a glowing crimson. yet behind him, the path in as it originally appeared. younger. the sky, bright. will has run deeper into the brush. smith notices something by his feet. he clears away the brush, revealing shapes beneath the foliage. his expression darkens.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{what did you find?}
<A>__{will has returned.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{come, come, son, no time for distractions. let's move on.}
<A>__{smith shoves will on, the boy unable to see what smith saw. pan down. headstones. each bears a marking, the names still legible. maureen, penny and judy robinson.}
