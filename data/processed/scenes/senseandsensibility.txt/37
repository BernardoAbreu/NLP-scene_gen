<A>__{elinor has come to say goodbye to her horse. she strokes the soft face sadly. then she senses someone and turns to find edward standing nearby.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{cannot you take him with you?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{we cannot possibly afford him.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{perhaps he could make himself useful in the kitchen?}
<A>__{elinor tries to smile. edward looks at her for a long moment and then comes closer.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{miss dashwood elinor. i must talk to you.}
<A>__{the use of her christian name and in such a loving tone stops elinor's breath altogether.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{there is something of great importance i need... to tell you }
<A>__{he comes closer still. the horse breathes between them. elinor is on fire with anticipation but edward looks troubled and has less the air of a suitor than he might.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{ about about my education.}
<C>__{elinor}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{your education?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{yes. it was less... successful than it might have been.}
<A>__{edward laughs nervously. elinor is completely bewildered.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{it was conducted in plymouth oddly enough.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{indeed?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{yes. do you know it?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{plymouth?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{oh well i spent four years there at a school run by a a mr pratt }
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{pratt?}
<A>__{elinor is beginning to feel like a parrot.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{precisely mr pratt and there, i that is to say, he has a }
<A>__{as edward flounders, a familiar voice cuts through this unexpected foray into his academic past.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{edward! edward!}
<A>__{they turn to find fanny powering down upon them, waving a letter. edward steps back, glancing almost guiltily at elinor, who is as confused as we are.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{i have been all over for you! you are needed in london this instant!}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{fanny, i am leaving this afternoon as it is }
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{no, no, that will not do. family affairs are in chaos owing to your absence. mother is quite adamant that you should leave at once.}
<A>__{fanny is determined. she obviously has no intention of leaving him alone with elinor. edward turns to elinor, frustration in every muscle, his jaw set tight.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{excuse me, miss dashwood.}
<A>__{fanny drags edward off, leaving elinor to gaze sadly after them.}
