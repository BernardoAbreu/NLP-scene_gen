<D>__{thank you. now the negro in the field caught hell all day long. he was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. if the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. if the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. and if you said to him, "let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "yeah, man, any place is better than this." you've got a lot of field negroes in america today. i'm one.}
