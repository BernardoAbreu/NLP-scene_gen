<A>__{chuck bolger's car screeches to a halt, and toby exits, followed by an empty hawaiian punch can which someone tosses after him. toby gives a wave, starts toward the house, and the car lays rubber, while over that we hear psycho screaming, "agh h h!"}

<A>__{pearl is setting the table and singing the everly brothers hit, "bye, bye, love." the passage of two years has improved pearl. her bald spot has grown back in, and she has learned to fix her hair and use makeup. she smiles and nods to toby, never stopping her singing for a moment. toby stands next to her and sings harmony for a few notes. it is clear that their relationship has improved. toby stops singing.}
