<A>__{tom, off in the distance against a sky that seems to be touching the land is riding along a creek. closer up, we see he's rustling the bushes with a stick. some stray cows run out of the bushes. tom races after them. his horse shepherds the cow across the creek and up a hillside. at the top of the hill, with the ranch spread out endlessly before him, tom sees frank on his horse, chasing strays. tom whistles. frank waves back. in the near distance, a pickup truck is parked on the range. joe and the twins are throwing food pellets out of the back of the truck. cattle come from across the range for the food. what begins as a handful of cows becomes dozens, then hundreds the truck virtually disappearing among them. tom stops for a moment to look out at his ranch. far off in the distance, he sees annie's suburban coming along the road to the ranch. he watches as annie's distant figure gets out of the car with grace. annie instinctively turns and looks across the land. even though there is such a distance, there's a sense tom and annie are looking at each other. tom senses joe driving frank's truck, slowly moving off the range the twins in the back, the cattle following. tom sits on his horse atop the hill.}
