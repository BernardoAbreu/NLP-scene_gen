<L>__{interior the precog chamber}
<A>__{the chamber is an elaborate, hypertech hospital, constructed for the maintenance of three beings the precogs. they are triplets two of the precogs are male, one is female. technicians swarm all over them like worker bees. the bodies of the precogs are being tended to: exercised, cleansed, groomed. the head of each precog is encased in a complex, ornate helmet that seems to be an amalgam of organic tissues and bright metallics. the helmets pulse slightly, and the surfaces seem to flow and shift, like oil on water. a network of micro thin cables that are actually strands of light, rise medusa like from each helmet, then centralize into a single strand, and connect to a massive mainframe computer. the precogs appear to be in suspended animation, or in comas. they are absolutely still and limp except for their faces. their faces are in constant motion, the lips mouthing scenes from murders only they can see. life for a precog is an endless cycle of death. close on the female precog we recognize her fragile and perfect face from the opening scene of the movie. she floats in a glowing nutritive bath. like her brothers, she seems to be eternally young, or eternally old. the technicians lift her from her bath. she is dried, dressed in a robe, then guided into an over sized, throne like chair. her brothers are guided into their thrones, on either side of her. not once are their helmets removed. what they feed into the mainframe is too valuable. it must be gathered twenty four unrelenting hours a day.}
