<D>__{on my facebook page recently i had 800 friends requests, i accepted them all, i didn't even look at them, then i noticed someone had created a fan page for me. if it had been for something i had done to help the community or benefit something i'd love it, but it's just kind of awkward for me that these people are loving me for something that's looked down on in society... it's kinda showing that america has some sick fascination with a bonnie and clyde kind of thing.}
