<L>__{interior harvey's apartment day}
<A>__{harvey turns around from the scene and ponders it. he moves back towards his pile of stick figure drawings.}
<B>__{close on paper}
<A>__{harvey scribbles the words "american splendor" at the top of the page.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior cleveland diner 1975 day}
<A>__{the following scene is shot through the restaurant window. we see reflections of people walking by. a tense harvey starts at crumb as he eats a burger and reads harvey's mock ups. harvey doesn't touch his burger deluxe and nervously talks in his laryngitis afflicted voice.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{see, ever since i read your stuff, man i've been thinking i could write comic book stories that were different from anything being done.}
<C>__{crumb}
<P>__{(munching on a fry)}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{i'm thinkin', the guys who do animal comics and super hero stuff are really limited 'cause they gotta try to appeal to kids. and underground comics like yours have been really subversive or opened things up politically. but there is still plenty more ta be done with 'em, too, y'know?}
<C>__{crumb}
<D>__{pass me the ketchup?}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{i mean with pictures and words, it could be more of an art form. like those french movies are. or de sica over in italy, y'know?... so i tried writin' some things about real life. stuff the everyman's gotta deal with.}
<A>__{crumb finally looks up from harvey's work.}
<C>__{crumb}
<D>__{these are about you.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{er, yeah...}
<C>__{crumb}
<D>__{you turned yourself into a comic hero?}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{sorta, yeah. but no idealized shit. no phony bullshit. the real thing, y'know? ordinary life is pretty complex stuff.}
<A>__{crumb reads more. harvey waits anxiously. finally crumb starts to chuckle.}
<C>__{crumb}
<D>__{these are really good, harv.}
<C>__{harvey}
<P>__{(insecure)}
<D>__{really? ya think so?}
<A>__{crumb shuffles through more.}
<C>__{crumb}
<D>__{yeah. this is great stuff, man. i dig it. can i take them home and illustrate them?}
<A>__{harvey is practically bursting.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{wow!!}
<A>__{harvey's voice breaks like a kid in puberty. he clears his throat. and something miraculous happens... when harvey opens his mouth to speak his laryngitis is gone!}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{you'd do that for me, man? that'd be great! i can't draw a straight line!}
<C>__{crumb}
<D>__{hey, what's up with your voice, harv? all of a sudden it sounds fine.}
<C>__{harvey}
<P>__{(thrilled)}
<D>__{i don't know, man! i guess you cured me!}
