<A>__{the helicopter descends, its whirling blades stirring up a windstorm on the roof of the old abandoned cathedral. dead leaves rise and swirl in the churning air.}

<A>__{the joker makes a futile grab at the rope ladder, almost losing his purchase on the archway parapet. he gestures wildly for the copter to make another pass. 0:12 to go.}
<L>__{exterior belltower}
<A>__{a maelstrom of swirling leaves. and now, among the leaves roused from their resting place in the rotten rafters of the old cathedral a horde of squealing, chittering bats!! filling the air like a black cloud, hundreds of them, taking flight in blind uncomprehending fury }
<L>__{interior belltower}
<A>__{the joker leaps into empty space, grabs hold of the ladder, cackles in mad triumph and suddenly the belltower is full of bats. a screeching swarm, hideous, black winged swooping through the archways directly at the joker who screams in terror lets go of the ladder and plunges into the night. tight on batman. six seconds remain. there is still time if he makes his choice now. surrounded by the flapping of leathery wings, his body working on pure adrenalin, he unbuckles the belt. lurches into position. heaves it out into the darkness. it snags on the bottom rung of the dangling rope ladder.}
