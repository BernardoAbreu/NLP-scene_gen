<L>__{exterior main street day}
<A>__{celebratory banners are strung over this street, including one that reads: "deer season starts today!" we're in the center of wheelsy, south carolina, a moderately depressed small town. today's a big day, as hunters from far and near crowd the streets in their massive pickups. men spill in and out of a gun store buying loads of ammunition. old hunters with faces like prunes stand outside angell's tavern getting drunk. a man with few teeth has a dead deer strung out across the back of his truck, skinning the carcass, its innards spilling loose. jack, an older, uptight man in fancy clothes, is driving through town in his big old cadillac. he comes upon a hunter's truck, double parked, jamming up traffic. jack jams on his horn.}
