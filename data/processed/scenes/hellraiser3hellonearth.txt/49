<A>__{thick green jungle foliage obscures the view of a pov camera. the sounds of confused battle are heard off; helicopters, gun fire, distant explosions, screams of the dying and the wounded leaves and branches smack against the frame as the unseen dreamer rushes confusedly through the dense forest. the voices of the soldiers distant, echoed, repeated are heard over the roar of battle.}

<A>__{the sound of their voices seems to prompt the pov camera to more furious endeavor. it turns rapidly left and right, forcing its way through the greenery until suddenly, with one last push through foliage thick enough to be a single bush, the view changes completely.}
