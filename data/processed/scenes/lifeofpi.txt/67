<L>__{exterior the lifeboat dawn}
<A>__{silence. morning. hazy. pi slumps over the oar, eyes half open, glazed. he has stayed up a second night for fear of being attacked, and now he slowly nods sideways, giving in to exhaustion despite himself, and tumbles into the water. pi gasps in shock as the water slaps him into full consciousness. he climbs back onto the life ring coughing, tired, wet, sad and fearful. the lifeboat rolls and growls beneath pi's feet as he stares and then he notices o.j. the poor orang is sitting on a side bench half hidden by the tarp, and horribly seasick. her tongue lolls out of her mouth and she's visibly panting.}

<D>__{i'm sorry, o.j.; i don't have any seasickness medicine for you }
<A>__{and then it strikes him.}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{supplies! ah, supplies!}
<A>__{pi pulls up the edge of the tarp nearest the bow. a row of benches with hinged lids curve around the bow. pi opens the rearmost bench and finds a "lifeboat manual and navigational guide" in a plastic bag along with a pencil lying on top of bags of supplies. he pulls out the manual and flips through it an illustration shows that the boat is lined with compartments. he opens the next bench it's stuffed with life jackets. he tosses one of the life jackets to o.j., who has no idea what to make of it. o.j. turns to watch him, utterly bewildered.}
