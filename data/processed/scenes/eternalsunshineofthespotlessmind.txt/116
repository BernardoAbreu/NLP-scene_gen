<L>__{interior joel's bedroom night}
<A>__{the lights are off. joel sits on a chair near the window, writing in his journal. the streetlight illuminates the paper. naomi sleeps in the bed.}
<D>__{voice over i met someone tonight at a party on the beach. her name is clementine. there is something alive about her.}
<A>__{naomi turns over in bed, sees joel.}
<C>__{naomi}
<P>__{(full of sleep)}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{how was it?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{you didn't miss much. rob carrie say hello.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{hi, rob and carrie.}
<C>__{joel}

<A>__{the room is starting to decompose.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{yeah. come to bed. i'm cold.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{in a minute.}
<A>__{naomi turns over. joel goes back to his writing.}
<D>__{voice over}
<P>__{(more and more emotionless)}
<D>__{i don't know what to do about this. i've been feeling so alienated and numb lately. forever. the thought of not acknowledging my feelings again seems self destructive. how can i continue on this path toward a living death, a life filled with obligation and guilt and responsibility but joyless, hopeless? i need to speak with clementine.}
<A>__{the scene has turned to a husk.}
