<A>__{lindsey is slumped in a chair, just staring. withdrawn. the others are conserving oxygen and heat, huddling in the dark. the air is looking pretty thick. the speaker of the hydrophone transceiver crackles to life.}

<D>__{deepcore, do you read? this is benthic explorer, over.}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{hell yes, we read! good of you to join us. how's that storm doin'?}
<C>__{mcbride}
<D>__{well, it's strange... it just kind've blew itself out all of the sudden. we're up here in a flat sea with no wind. but then a lot of weird things've been happening.}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{well, hell, son. you better get us a line down here, we're in moderately poor shape.}
<A>__{later, hippy, catfish, and monk are conferring b.g. on how to get a new umbilical hooked on. one night is talking to mcbride on the hydrophone.}

<C>__{one night}
<D>__{hey. hey! hey!! look... it's bud.}
<C>__{monk}
<D>__{that's impossible.}
<A>__{lindsey bolts to the screen. stares at the message printing out. a huge grin wraps around her face.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{no it's not.}
<C>__{mcbride }
<D>__{what's it say?}
<A>__{lindsey take the mike and sits before the screen. during the message, her voice will go through an emotional spectrum from confusion to wonder, to a childlike joy.}
