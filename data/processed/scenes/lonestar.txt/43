<C>__{pilar}
<D>__{a real palace. she rattles around alone in that thing }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{she's done well for herself on her own and all }
<C>__{pilar}
<D>__{so she tells me three times a week.}
<A>__{she looks at him }
<C>__{pilar}
<D>__{i thought you got through that pretty well.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{they cooked the whole thing up without asking me.}
<C>__{pilar}
<D>__{people liked him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{most people did, yeah.}
<C>__{pilar}
<D>__{i remember him watching me once. when i was little before you and i }
<A>__{she shrugs.}
<C>__{pilar}
<D>__{i was on the playground with all the other kids, but i thought he was only looking at me. i was afraid he was going to arrest me he had those eyes, you know }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{pilar}
<D>__{weird what you remember.}
<A>__{they walk in silence a moment }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{your boy, there }
<C>__{pilar}
<D>__{amado.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{nice looking kid.}
<C>__{pilar}
<D>__{he hates me.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{pilar}
<D>__{with paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me totally age appropriate. but amado he's he's never been book smart. had a hard time learning to read. me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment like a betrayal.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{fernando did okay, and he dropped out }
<C>__{pilar}
<D>__{fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. he just wanted to fix their cars.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it might just be the age. i spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack.}
<A>__{she looks at him }
<C>__{pilar}
<D>__{so why did you come back here, sam?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{got divorced, i wasn't gonna work for my father in law anymore. the fellas down here said they'd back me }
<C>__{pilar}
<D>__{you don't want to be sheriff.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i got to admit it's not what i thought it'd be. back when buddy had it hell, i'm just a jailer. run a 60 room hotel with bars on the windows.}
<C>__{pilar}
<D>__{it can happen so sudden, can't it? being left out on your own.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you've got your mother, your kids }
<C>__{pilar}
<D>__{they've got me. different thing.}
<A>__{they stop at a spot where you can climb down the bank }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{remember this?}
<A>__{pilar looks at the spot. she isn't ready to deal with whatever memory it brings back }
<C>__{pilar}
<D>__{i should get back.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{pilar }
<C>__{pilar}
<D>__{looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. it's really nice to talk with you, sam.}
<A>__{she waves and walks away, feeling awkward. sam watches for a minute, then turns and steps down to the bank, he looks at the water.}
<B>__{river surface}
<A>__{a little piece of tree bark is tossed onto the water and drifts away with the current. we tilt up to see young pilar tossing bark into the river as young sam sits on the bank beside her. they are 14 and 15 years old it is 1972 }
<C>__{young sam}
<D>__{you going to tell her?}
<C>__{young pilar}
<D>__{you going to tell him?}
<C>__{young sam}
<D>__{he doesn't need to know all my business.}
<C>__{young pilar}
<D>__{he's gonna find out.}
<C>__{young sam}
<D>__{so? what's he gonna do, arrest us?}
<A>__{young pilar frowns, tosses more bark }
<C>__{young pilar}
<D>__{it's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.}
<C>__{young sam}
<D>__{you believe that?}
<B>__{cu young pilar}
<A>__{she turns to look at him }
<C>__{young pilar}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{we pan with her gaze to see sam, present day, sitting on the bank, lost in thought }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{me neither.}
