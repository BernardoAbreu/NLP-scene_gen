<L>__{interior plane day}
<A>__{tim has a window seat. he reads the safety card. he's sweaty, anxious. a vaguely swarthy man (indian? italian? hard to tell.), 40s, sits next to him. a perky flight attendant approaches.}
<C>__{flight attendant}
<D>__{you lucky ducks are obviously seated in an exit row. score!}
<C>__{flight attendant }
<D>__{just gotta make sure you're willing and able to assist crew members in the event of an emergency evacuation...}
<A>__{the man smiles nonchalantly. tim tries to play it cool.}

<D>__{you're talking what, water landing?}
<P>__{(looks around, whispers)}
<D>__{terror type deal? terrorists...?}
<C>__{flight attendant}
<D>__{it's really just a formality.}

<C>__{tim}
<P>__{(takes a moment)}
<D>__{ok. if you need any help, i'm in.}
<A>__{the flight attendant smiles politely, if confusedly.}
<B>__{the plane takes off}
<A>__{tim looks out the window, watching nervously as the dairy farms and frozen lakes of northern wisconsin recede. he instinctively turns to his neighbor.}

<D>__{as in, "don't you get lippy with me, mister." my grandma used to say that. before she passed. lot of people pronounce it lip. course the high german's probably more like lipp uh.}
<A>__{david marinakis nods, goes back to his book, seemingly shutting down the conversation. tim settles in. the plane lands tim hesitates before stepping onto the jetway one small step for man and just like that, he's in iowa!}
