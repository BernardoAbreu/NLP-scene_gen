<A>__{charlotte happily wolfs down her continental breakfast. wills sits across from her, watching and worrying.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{didn't anyone ever teach you that it's bad manners to stare at a girl when she's eating like a pig?}
<A>__{wills chuckles, then his smile fades and he clears his throat.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{listen }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{uh oh. here it comes.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{that's right, because, look, i could put this off, but i genuinely like you. so i want to be clear... right now... from the start, so there's no chance for misunderstanding later.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{what i want to say you is.... well... that all i can offer you is this... what we have right now... nothing more substantial... just this... until it ends.}
<A>__{she looks at him. lowers her fork. he adds almost reluctantly }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{the truth is, we have no future together.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i know. i'm dying.}
<A>__{wills' face reddens slightly. he shifts uneasily in his chair. a suggestion of a smile plays along his features }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{what... what do you mean?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{what i said. nobody thought i'd even last this long.}
<A>__{wills stares at her blankly, not knowing what to think or say.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i could have put off telling you, but i genuinely like you, so i wanted to be clear... you know, right from the start.}
<A>__{olivia enters, takes her orange juice glass and leaves a full one.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{thanks, olivia!}
<A>__{charlotte gulps down the juice. wills watches, his mind reeling.}
