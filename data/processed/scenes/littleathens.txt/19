<A>__{wide across the width of the pool. corey, wet, with goggles on his head, holding a wrench and screw driver, and bystander #1, stand over a young twenty ish female victim who lies passed out on the cement. a young female lifeguard is kneeling beside the victim, checking her pulse and breathing. the two swimmers left in the pool are climbing out. pete, a no nonsense grounds keeper in his late thirties, wearing cut off shorts, a faded t shirt and a tool belt, approaches to have a word with corey.}
