<L>__{91. interior the desert. night.}
<A>__{there's a small, weak fire. the group crouch around it. the boys talk noisily to almasy. kamal is wrapped in a blanket and shivering. almasy gives him water, speaks to katherine.}
<C>__{almasy}
<D>__{kamal is passing blood. he must have had some internal damage in the crash. he needs medicine. i think we must risk the other flare.}
<A>__{he gets up and loads the flare with what is clearly the last charge. this time the effect is dramatic with a red umbrella of light. katharine comes up beside him. they wait, hope fading with the flare.}
<C>__{katharine}
<P>__{(blank)}
<D>__{geoffrey's not in cairo.}
<P>__{(almasy looks at her)}
<D>__{he's not actually a buffoon. and the plane wasn't a wedding present. it belongs to the british government. they want aerial maps of the whole north africa. so i think he's in ethiopia. in case you were counting on his sudden appearance.}
<C>__{almasy}
<D>__{and the marriage is that a fiction?}
<A>__{there's a beat. katharine has a hundred answers.}
<C>__{katharine}
<D>__{no, the marriage isn't a fiction.}
<A>__{the light from the flare fades on them and they stand in the dark. suddenly on the far horizon, behind their heads, an answering flare fireworks into the sky.}
<C>__{katharine}
<D>__{thank god. oh, thank god.}
<A>__{there's excited shouting from the two fit boys. they leap up and run towards the couple, who meanwhile have realized that the flare has not come from madox, but from an approaching camel caravan. almasy shouts to the boys for some identification.}
<C>__{katharine}
<D>__{do they know them?}
<C>__{almasy}
<P>__{(squinting at the horizon)}
<D>__{no, but i think i do.}
<A>__{the caravan slowly comes into focus. it's fenelon barnes. katharine touches almasy's arm an almost imperceptible gesture.}
<C>__{katharine}
<D>__{am i k. in your book? i think i must be.}
<A>__{almasy turns to her. he runs the blade of his arm across her neck the sweat leaving a clear stripe. fenelon barnes approaches, dismounts from his camel, and addresses almasy.}
<D>__{fenelon barnes i recollect your saying to ignore your bones but i assume you have no objection to my rescuing your companion?}
<P>__{(to katharine)}
<D>__{good evening, mrs. clifton.}
<C>__{katharine}
<P>__{(accepting his handshake)}
<D>__{hello. fenelon barnes i'd like to introduce you to my camel the most notable beast on earth.}
<P>__{(to almasy)}
<D>__{i understand you found some remarkable caves.}
<A>__{a goatskin bag of water is offered to katharine. she drinks and hands it to almasy.}
<D>__{fenelon barnes paintings of swimmers? remarkable.}
