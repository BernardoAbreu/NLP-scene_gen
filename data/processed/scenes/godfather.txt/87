<L>__{ext nite: don's hospital (winter 1945)}
<A>__{a taxi pulls up in front of a hospital, marked clearly with a neon sign "hospital emergency." michael steps out, pays the fare...and then stops dead in his tracks. michael looks. he sees the hospital in the night; but it is deserted. he is the only one on the street. there are gay, twinkling christmas decorations all over the building. he walks, slowly at first, and then ever so quickly, up the steps. he hesitates, looks around. this area is empty. he checks the address on a scrap of paper. it is correct. he tries the door, it is empty. he walks in.}
