<L>__{interior hall of advanced fossil mammals day}
<A>__{more cops gather, surrounded by skeletons of primates... humans, monkeys, gorillas. it's an odd sight. they all look up with interest as in walks the imposing figure of... special agent pendergast. he turns to a young eager beaver, officer bailey, flashes his badge. bailey straightens to attention.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{could you please take me to the officer in charge?}
<L>__{interior circular stairwell day}
<A>__{pendergast follows bailey as they descend the rickety old metal staircase that goes into the bowels of the museum. the hall below them is narrowand lit by an occasional bare bulb. the stairway opens onto a maze like set of rooms in the basement. everything around them is streaked and spattered in blood. there are trails of it on the floor, the walls, the overhead light. several cops stand guard as detective vince d'agosta goes over the area. he is a round, balding, man with an unmistakable air of authority. a modern knight in shining armor in disguise... deep disguise. he has on a cheap polyester short sleeved shirt. his t shirt is plainly visible underneath. on his worn plastic belt is a badge.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{don't touch anything until the s.o.c. has finished with those stairs. keep everyone clear of the perimeter. i don't want any contamination. there's an incredible amount of blood evidence down here. we need more light. where's the photographer? tell him to quit eating donuts, i need him.}
<A>__{as pendergast enters, d'agosta looks up at this serious african american in simple black suit, white shirt and dark tie.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{who are you? the undertaker?}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{special agent pendergast. fbi.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{vince d'agosta. am i out?}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{not at all. i think we may be working on the same case. if so, i could use your help.}
<A>__{the two men shake hands. they couldn't be more different. pendergast is an elegant intellectual... d'agosta a working class spark plug who operates from the gut. pendergast gestures to the form on the ground.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{the body?}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{what's left of it.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{mind if i have a look?}
<A>__{d'agosta calls to a police photographer who comes down the staircase carrying lights, a donut stuffed in his mouth.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{we need light in here, stat.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{where's the head?}
<A>__{d'agosta points to a lump the size of a bowling ball that's in the corner.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{careful. that mess on the ground is brains.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{whose footprints?}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{night watchman who found the body. sweet old man. been tossing his cookies for over an hour. not a likely suspect.}
<A>__{the photographer is finally ready and he floods the dark room with light. and now everyone (but not us) gets a very clear look at the body. the photographer... spits out his donut. his eyes roll up and he drops in a dead fainterior just like that. d'agosta swallows hard.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{woof.}
<A>__{pendergast looks down, utterly impassive.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{yes, i'd say we're definitely working on the same case.}
