<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior hallway l.a. county morgue day}
<A>__{winter, a deputy medical examiner (human), is leading sykes and jetson along the hall. he reads on the fly from a case file in his hand.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{you know i've been over all this with fedorchuk and alterez this morning...}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{come on. you got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.}
<L>__{interior autopsy room day}
<A>__{they enter briskly through a swinging door. they move among the tables (some occupied, some not) during:}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{yeah, right. don't push your luck. anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car }
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{the human?}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{yeah... he was one martin helder. white male, twenty seven. let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.}
<A>__{they have reached a table holding a covered body. winter unceremoniously throws back the cover. there lies the pale naked body of the raincoat alien.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{have you identified this one?}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{so far he's a john doe. or a sam slag, if you like.}
<A>__{jetson smiles slightly out of politeness.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{no i.d. on him and well, you know, no fingerprints so it could be tough. your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.}
<A>__{jetson nonchalantly looks over the alien body while winter and sykes continue talking off to one side.}
<C>__{winter}
<P>__{(referring to raincoat alien)}
<D>__{you took this gut out, too, didn't you?}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{lucky nothing. i had to empty my damn gun into him.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{that's the way these people are. you don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.}
<A>__{during this, jetson has turned the dead alien's hand over sees something that brings a frown of curiosity to his face. he leans closer, examining the palm carefully. then he peels back the alien's upper lip. jetson frowns anew, with concern this time. he looks around, spots a newcomer lab assistant nearby bentner. jetson motions him over. jetson begins questioning him using the alien language. sykes and winter nearby, remain oblivious.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.}
<P>__{(hands sykes a}
<D>__{polariod of dead}
<P>__{alien's face)}
<D>__{we're just about to start cutting in. you're welcome to stick around if you want. it's really fascinating stuff.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{yeah, i will bet.}
<A>__{sykes looks over, now noticing jetson and bentner in earnest conversation. he only catches snatches of the alien language. bentner appears very unsettled by what jetson is telling him. in response to jetson's final statement, bentner nods as if agreeing to do something jetson has requested. sykes goes over to jetson.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{what's this? what's going on?}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(really suspicious now)}
<D>__{nothing?}
<C>__{jetson}
<P>__{(looking away)}
<D>__{shouldn't we examine their personal effects?}
<A>__{jetson moves off, leaving sykes there wondering.}
