<L>__{interior dancing elk school bleeker's locker day}
<A>__{bleeker retrieves a book from his open locker. juno marches up to him, belly leading the way.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{are you honestly and truly going to prom with katrina de voort?}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{um, hi?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{leah just told me you were going with her.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{yeah, i did ask her if she wanted to go. a bunch of us from the team are going to benihana, then the prom, then vijay's parents' cabin.}
<A>__{juno is clearly affronted.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<P>__{(meekly)}
<D>__{we're getting a stretch limo.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{you're mad. why are you mad?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i'm not mad. i'm in a fucking great mood. despite the fact that i'm trapped in a fat suit i can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{katrina's not my girlfriend! and i doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. she just looks like that all the time.}
<A>__{a girl strides past (obviously katrina) with a sour look aimed squarely at juno.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{whatever. have fun at the prom with soupy sales. i'm sure i can think of something way more cool to do that night. like i could pumice my feet, or go to bren's dumb unitarian church, or get hit by a ten ton truck full of hot garbage juice. all those things would be exponentially cooler than going to the prom with you.}
<A>__{she starts to walk away. bleeker takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{you're being really immature.}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(turning around)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{bleeker braces himself and pushes up his lab goggles.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{that's not how our thing works! i hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{not this time. you don't have any reason to be mad at me. you broke my heart. i should be royally ticked at you, man. i should be really cheesed off. i shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{why? because i got bored and had sex with you one day, and then i didn't, like, marry you?}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{like i'd marry you! you would be the meanest wife of all time. and anyway, i know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on tv. the blair witch project was on starz, and you were like, "oh, i want to watch this, but we should make out instead. la la la."}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{forget it, bleek. take katrina the douche packer to the prom. i'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!}
<C>__{bleeker}
<P>__{(searching for a comeback)}
<D>__{yeah, well... i still have your underwear.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i still have your virginity!}
<C>__{bleeker}
<P>__{(looking around, panicked)}
<D>__{oh my god, shut up!}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{what? are you ashamed that we did it?}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater. i'm a planet!}
<A>__{juno picks up her backpack dejectedly and slides it over her shoulder. she's about to walk away, when...}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{wait, let me take that.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{you shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. i will take it.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{oh. it's fine. what's another ten pounds?}
<A>__{she turns around, wipes tears off her cheek (making sure no one sees) and continues down the hallway.}
