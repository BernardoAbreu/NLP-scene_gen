<L>__{interior recording studio (last session) la dec 1970 night}
<A>__{a dark silence hovers along the deserted, bunker like studio. mike stands and booms shadow a grand piano... the engineer waits in the booth, lit, alert man, bored, fiddling...}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{hey jim, it's your birthday man, whaddaya say we try this another night...}
<A>__{camera moving tentatively along the shadows, discovering the sidelight on a navy surplus pea jacket thrown on a chair; moving to a candle's orange flutter on pages written with verse... a hand breaking the seal of the bottle of irish bushmill's whiskey.}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{kill the lights a little more, will ya john?}
<A>__{they might drop a bit more... camera crawling past the fingers weaving a new cigarette out of the marlboro pack. an ashtray full of butts... and an asthmatic horrid cough, filled with phlegm... crawling up the slight paunch in the bright jersey with #66 on it... stitched on the sleeve is the team mascot an american indian in full headdress.}

<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{hey man, how come the doors aren't in on this?}
<A>__{camera revealing james douglas morrison, 27, poet, buried in the shadows, curls of cigarette smoke about his haunted sensuous eyes, meditative lips scragged with beard and long greasy hair, not a pretty sight, yet a man full and bold and struggling for survival through his words... beneath the bushmill moon, he takes the tambourine and shakes it violently in our face}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{no music, no doors. let's roll... is everybody in?... is everybody in?... is everybody in? the ceremony is about to begin...}
<A>__{he shakes a tambourine at the mike and one of his sudden giant indian yells rock through the studio.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{wake up!!!! has this dream stopped!!!!}
<A>__{music riffs from "american prayer". audience sounds ghostly on the track. the engineer reeling backwards from the sudden shift in sound, cursing silent.}
<C>__{jim voice}
<D>__{let me tell you about the heartache and the loss of god wandering wandering in hopeless night indian's scattered on dawn's highway bleeding ghosts crowd the young childs fragile eggshell mind...}
