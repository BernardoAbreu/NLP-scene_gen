<L>__{interior chancellor wilson's office day}
<A>__{chancellor grant wilson, 60, grey haired eminence, sits behind his desk. seated across from him are coach winters and galen howard, 50, the athletic director.}
<C>__{chancellor wilson}
<D>__{i'm concerned about our program. it's always been a source of pride to our students and alumni, but two straight so so seasons are having a damaging effect on our fund raising, both public and private.}
<C>__{winters}
<P>__{(half joking)}
<D>__{then stop raising the entrance requirements on me. we never could have gotten alvin mack in here under the new guidelines.}
<C>__{chancellor wilson}
<D>__{as chancellor, my first responsibility is to the academic interests of this university.}
<A>__{wilson points to a representation of a football field affixed to the wall. a football rests on the 40 yard line, which is marked 160 million. the end zone (60 yards away) is $400,000,000.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{at a time when we're committed to a 400 million dollar building program, alumni donations are down 15% the last two years. because they've also voiced their displeasure to their legislators, we can expect a corresponding drop in state funds.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{the athletic fund is suffering too. season tickets sales are off, merchandising's slow...}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{you layin' all this at my door? there's been a recession on.}
<C>__{chancellor wilson}
<D>__{yes, but the heaviest drop has been from the big donors, the 100,000 dollar club. these people are recession proof. they sit in my box every game, and they're much more generous when we're ranked and going to bowl games. two of them, as you know, are on the board of regents, including the chairman.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{what are you trying to say to me, grant? after 12 years, my job's in jeopardy?}
<C>__{chancellor wilson}
<D>__{i'm not prepared to discuss your job right now; i just want you to be aware of the situation. the alumni and the legislature are unhappy and they vote with their checkbooks. i don't pretend to be an expert on football, sam, and i will deny that this conversation ever took place, but i do know we need to win next year.}
