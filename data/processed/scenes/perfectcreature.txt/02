<T>__{fade up:}
<L>__{int: doctors surgery day}
<A>__{we are very close on a bespectacled eye. it stares at us and then looks down.}
<C>__{genetic doctor}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{see here. this is what you need to look for.}
<A>__{cut to the object in the genetic doctors hand; it is like an x ray, yet the image looks remarkably like a dna profile.}
<C>__{genetic doctor}
<P>__{(continuing; off)}
<D>__{a genetic mutation, we all carry it. but we now know a virus activates it.}
<A>__{we reveal the genetic doctor, sitting at his desk, smoking a cigarette. the surgery and the clothes suggest the year, yet there are small things that are different, not what you'd expect to be around at this time. standing next to him in the dusty haze of the room is a younger doctor; an apprentice who looks attentive.}
<C>__{genetic doctor}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{this virus plays some unknown role in the birth the brothers. of course the mutation occurs very rarely these days. and only in males.}
<A>__{the apprentice nods and then looks up. there is someone else in the room. a woman who we now see is pregnant. there is something about her that suggests more a prisoner or psychiatric patient than a normal pregnant mother.}
<C>__{genetic doctor}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{strange isn't? apprentice doctor strange?}
<C>__{genetic doctor}
<D>__{that god would choose such humble vehicle for a miracle. the mothers invariably come from the slums, we don't know why.}
<P>__{(to the woman)}
<D>__{this is your 7th isn't it?}
<A>__{we see the woman; she's like a hollow person, hardly aware of where she is. the doctor shuffles papers. finds what he wants.}
<C>__{genetic doctor}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{yes, her first was successful, a brother was born. thereafter variously malformed offspring. we can only hope this one will be different.}
<P>__{(to woman)}
<D>__{you'll have to try harder this time.}
<A>__{the woman now looks up. and tentatively speaks.}
<C>__{woman in the surgury}
<D>__{please...}
<C>__{genetic doctor}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{woman in the surgury}
<D>__{please... i want to keep my baby. they always take my babies away.}
<C>__{genetic doctor}
<D>__{don't be stupid woman!}
<A>__{the woman drops her eyes. we see the apprentice doctor, almost pitying the poor woman.}
<D>__{apprentice doctor}
<P>__{(to woman)}
<D>__{you won't have to worry. the brotherhood will take him...}
<A>__{we are closer on the woman now. tears begin to glisten in her eyes as we drift closer to her.}
<D>__{apprentice doctor}
<P>__{(continuing; off)}
<D>__{...raise him in the church, teach him. he's special. you should be proud. it's a blessing really, he'll want for nothing. not like the rest of us?}
<A>__{we track in closer, closer, to the woman, then continue, right into her eye, through the fluid, to see the room reflected upside down at the back of the retina. this dissolves to an upside view of...}
