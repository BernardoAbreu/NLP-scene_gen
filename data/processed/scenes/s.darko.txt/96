<L>__{interior lab day}
<A>__{jeremy turns on the overhead florescent lights in the lab. there are rows of desks with microscopes and some precision}
<B>__{rock slicing equipment.}
<A>__{as he walks to a desk near the back, he can barely contain his excitement. sam follows, taking note of a large rabbit in an extremely small cage...}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{here's my station.}
<A>__{he unlocks a drawer in the lower portion of the desk and retrieves a box containing a tiny slice of rock with a grid like pattern of metallic crystals embedded in it.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that's it?}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{the rest is locked away somewhere else... somewhere safe. everyone's gonna want a piece of this thing pretty soon.}
<A>__{he takes it over to an scanning electron microscope and turns it on. he places the meteorite slice in the microscope's vacuum column through an airtight door.}
<C>__{jeremy }
<D>__{you ever seen one of these?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{it's a scanning electron microscope. it uses electrons instead of light to scan the image.}
<A>__{a black & white image appears on the microscope's monitor it's a geometric collage of all shapes and shades.}
<C>__{jeremy }
<D>__{at first i thought it was a siderite, but then i saw it was more than that. much more. it does have a percentage of nickel and iron in it as i first suspected. but it also has something else.}
<A>__{he waits for sam to take the bait.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and what's that?}
<A>__{he points to cluster of bright whites on the monitor. their shapes are strangely different than the others surrounding them.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{an unrecognizable element. i've done all the tests. it doesn't exist on the periodic table.}
<A>__{jeremy is practically beaming.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{so this is pretty major.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{this is history. i'm thinking of calling it framium.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{framium?}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{for my last name... frame.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what if it's like... proof of some alien life form from another galaxy or something.}
<A>__{jeremy's tone becomes serious, and he starts to scratch at his left forearm as he talks.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{it's very important you promise me you won't tell anyone else what i've showed you. i have to wait till just the right moment. nasa, or some secret government organization could come in here and take it away from me...}
<A>__{as jeremy gets more worked up, he scratches harder...}
<C>__{jeremy }
<D>__{and then later on, years from now, take credit for the discovery themselves.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i won't say anything.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{sam stares at him for a long beat, as if examining him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{there's this book i think you'd like... i got it from my physics teacher in high school.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{the study of physics has unraveled some of the most profound mysteries of the universe.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's called the philosophy of time travel.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{time travel?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yeah, but it's not really that. it's more like one scenario, or one type of scenario. i don't completely understand it...}
<A>__{sam gazes at the cluster of white shapes on the monitor.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{another mystery.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{my life seems to be full of them.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{mysteries are what make life interesting...}
<A>__{sam doesn't agree or disagree. she's become tense, because jeremy's face is now in close proximity to hers.}
<C>__{jeremy }
<D>__{you're a mystery to me, samantha.}
<A>__{he goes in for a kiss, but sam gently pushes him away.}
<C>__{jeremy }
<D>__{ow...}
<A>__{jeremy retreats, shielding his left arm. sam looks down and sees that the red, raw area has turned into a much bigger rash, covering a large part of his wrist and extending onto his forearm.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that doesn't look good.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{i should get some hydrocortisone.}
<A>__{he looks pathetic, and sam feels sorry for him.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(regarding the attempted kiss)}
<D>__{sorry about that.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i should've know better. you barely know me, right?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and nobody really calls my samantha. just my mom and dad.}
<A>__{jeremy manages a smile, and sam smiles back.}
