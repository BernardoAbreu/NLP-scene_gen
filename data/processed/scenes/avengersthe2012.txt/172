<T>__{inside iron man helmet:}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{then skip the spinning rims, we’re on the clock.}
<A>__{back to scene: tony lands and as his suit is deconstructed, he walks through into the tower penthouse, watching loki carefully. loki walks in as well.}
<L>__{interior penthouse, stark tower continuous}
<A>__{inside the tower, loki walks forward as tony goes behind his bar.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{please tell me you’re going to appeal to my humanity.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{uh actually, i’m planning to threaten you.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{you should have left your armor on for that.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{yeah, it’s seen a bit of mileage. you’ve got the uh blue stick of destiny. would you like a drink?}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{stalling me won’t change anything.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{no, no, no threatening. no drink? you sure? i’m having one.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{the chitauri are coming, nothing will change that. what have i to fear?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{the avengers. it’s what we call ourselves, sort of like a team. ’earth’s mightiest heroes’ type of thing.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{yes, i’m met them.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, i’ll give you that one. but, let’s do a head count here. your brother, the demi god;}
<A>__{loki turns away and tony slips a pair of bracelets onto his wrists.}
<D>__{a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you’ve managed to piss off every single one of them.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{that was the plan.}
<A>__{tony begins to walk to the center of the penthouse where loki is.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{not a great plan. when they come, and they will, they’ll come for you.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{i have an army.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{we have a hulk.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{oh, i thought the beast had wandered off.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{yeah you’re missing the pointerior there’s no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. maybe your army comes and maybe it’s too much for us, but it’s all on you. ’cause if we can’t protect the earth, you can be damned well sure we’ll avenge it.}
<A>__{loki walks over to tony, pointing his scepter.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{how will your friends have time for me, when they’re so busy fighting you?}
<A>__{loki walks up to tony, and places the tip of the scepter over his heart. it clinks against the arc reactor.}
<D>__{this usually works.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{well, performance issues. you know?}
<A>__{loki grabs tony by the throat and throws him across the room.}
<D>__{jarvis, anytime now.}
<A>__{loki grabs tony again.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{you will all fall before me.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{jarvis. deploy.}
<A>__{loki sends stark crashing through the window, and plummeting toward the ground.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{deploy!}
<A>__{behind loki, the mark seven suit goes rocketing past and out after stark....}
