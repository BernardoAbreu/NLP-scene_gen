<A>__{sam's p.o.v. as the ceiling lights and acoustical tiles begin to blur. the hallway grows dark. it is as though sam is blacking out.}
<L>__{exterior cemetery day}
<A>__{slowly, images begin to emerge out of the blackness. it takes a moment to realize that they are scenes from sam's funeral. the camera tracks along rows of mourners as seen from sam's p.o.v. he seems to be floating among them. we hear snippets of conversations. it all seems strangely odd and disjointed. time seems unfixed, malleable. we see a minister standing beside the grave.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{as we say farewell to our friend sam wheat, we are reminded of his kindness, his generosity, his buoyancy of spirit...}
<A>__{the camera keeps moving. sam's associates from the bank are among the mourners.}
<C>__{minister}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{all that we treasure, our friends, our loved ones, our body, our mind, are but on loan to us. we must surrender them all. we are all travelers on the same road which leads to the same end.}
<A>__{sam notices a woman in a fancy print dress comforting one of the mourners. the woman looks up at him, smiles, and waves. sam is surprised. he looks behind him, but no one is there. as he turns back, the woman is walking away. she appears just like any normal person until she approaches a large gravestone and passes right through it. sam is shocked.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{as our loved one enters eternal life, let us remember that love, too, is eternal, that although we will miss him, our love will light the void and dispel the darkness.}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{molly.}
<A>__{she does not respond. ruth, her sister, leans over to her. tears form in molly's eyes. a hand reaches out to give her a tissue. molly looks up. it is carl. she gives him her hand. he squeezes it with affection.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{...and into your hands we commend his spirit. may he rest in peace. in the name of the father, the son, and the holy ghost. amen.}
<A>__{the casket is lowered into the ground. molly approaches the grave. she us a little unsteady. carl takes her elbow. a shovel is placed in her hands. with great emotional effort she lifts a shovelful of dirt and tosses it onto the casket. it lands with a reverberating finality. sam shudders.}
