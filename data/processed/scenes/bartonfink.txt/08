<B>__{a tenement building}
<A>__{on manhattan's lower east side. early morning traffic is audible, as is the cry fishmongers.}
<B>__{back to barton}
<A>__{he rubs the back of his head, wincing, as he stares at the page. his gaze drifts up.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{the bathing beauty.}
<B>__{barton}
<A>__{looking at the picture. he presses the heels of his hands against his ears.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{the bathing beauty. faint, but building, is the sound of the surf.}
<B>__{barton}
<A>__{head cocked. the surf is mixing into another liquid sound. barton looks sharply around.}
<B>__{the bathroom}
<A>__{barton enters. the sink, which charlie apparently left running when he wet barton's towel, is overflowing. water spills onto the tile floor. barton hurriedly shuts off the tap, rolls up one sleeve and reaches into the sink. as his hand emerges, holding something, we hear the unclogged sink gulp water. barton's hand holding a dripping wad of cotton.}
<B>__{barton}
<A>__{after a brief, puzzled look he realizes where the cotton came from and convulsively flips it away.}
