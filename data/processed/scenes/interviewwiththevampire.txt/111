<L>__{exterior doll ship night}
<A>__{claudia, staring at the dolls. we see madeleine inside, painting a doll. she sees claudia and smiles and waves.}
<L>__{interior theatre night}
<A>__{louis, sitting alone in the box, as the curtains draw back, to show santiago as death, as before. louis takes advantage of the darkness to slip away.}
<L>__{interior armand's room night}
<A>__{armand opens the door to louis' knock.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{i was waiting for you...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{listen to me.}
<A>__{he follows armand into the room.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{claudia is dear to me. my... daughter.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{your lover.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{no, my beloved, my child.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{if you say so. you are innocent.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i'm not innocent. but i'm afraid. she feels she's in danger from the others.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{she is.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{but why?}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{i could give you reasons. her silence. her youth. it's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{then blame the one who made her...}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{did you kill this vampire who made you both? is that why you won't say his name? santiago thinks you did.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{we want no quarrel with him.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{it's already begun. if you want to save her, send her away.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{then i leave too.}
<A>__{armand smiles.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{so soon? without any of those answers you so longed for?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you said there were none.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{but you asked the wrong questions. do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? how quickly they perish of their own will.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{we can do that?}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{you would never give up life. if the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. you see too clearly. you see too much.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{that's what the one who made me said.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{how he must have loved you.}
<A>__{armand suddenly grips louis close to him.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{louis, i need you more than he ever did. i need a link with this century. the world changes. we do not. therein lies the irony that ultimately kills us. i need you to make contact with this age.}
<A>__{louis laughs bitterly.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{he? don't you see? i'm not the spirit of any age! i'm at odds with everything and always have been! i'm not even sure what i am!}
<A>__{armand smiles.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{but louis, that is the very spirit of your age. the heart of it. you fall from grace has been the fall of a century.}
<A>__{louis is stunned.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{and the vampires of the theatre?}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{like moths around the candle of the age. decadent, useless. they can't reflect anything. but you do. you reflect its broken heart.}
<A>__{louis is speechless.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{are these not the answers you came for?}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{yes... my god...}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{a vampire with a human soul. an immortal with a mortal's passion. you are beautiful, my friend. lestat must have wept when he made you }
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{lestat! you knew lestat!}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{yes i knew him. knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.}
<A>__{armand stands. he takes louis by the arm, leads him towards the back wall.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{but you must go now. you must get her safely out of paris.}
<A>__{he opens a hidden door in the wall.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{no one else knows of this door. when you knock you will find me waiting...}
