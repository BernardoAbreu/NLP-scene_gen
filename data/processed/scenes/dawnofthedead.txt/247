<A>__{roger drops another with a clean shot through the head, then he backs into the archway of the department store entrance. peter is desperately looking around for something to stand on to reach the gate.}

<A>__{the zombies are very close to the arch now, advancing steadily.}

<A>__{peter grabs a small counter used to display shoes, but it is too heavy for him to move himself.}

<D>__{here... come on...}
<A>__{roger has to abandon his post at the arch long enough to help drag the little counter. the men drag it to a point just at the side of the open arch, and peter instantly jumps up on the top of it. at that instant, a zombie rounds the corner and grabs at peter's legs. the big man kicks, startled, and the motion causes him to fall off the little counter. he lands on his feet, but out on the balcony beyond the arch. roger brings his rifle butt around against the creature's head and the zombie falls back, but is not dead. other creatures are only a few feet from peter, whose gun sits on the little counter inside the store. roger levels off his rifle but cannot fire as peter is in the line. peter makes a move and, like a football player, jukes to the left, then to the right. he dives right at one of the creatures carrying it into the store. now roger fires, dropping one, then another. peter jumps back up on the counter.}

<D>__{behind you... behind you...}
<A>__{the creature in the store has crashed against a cosmetics display and is regaining its footing. roger turns and fires. the creature falls. peter grabs the lip of the roll gate and starts to bring it down. there are several creatures right in the archway, now they clutch with their hands. one blocks the downward progress of the gate. roger fires point blank and the zombie flies back. the gate lowers but is stopped by the clutching hands of other creatures. roger grabs the cage now and helps to pull it down. peter, still gripping the lip, jumps off the counter to get more leverage. the bottom of the gate is now four feet from the floor. the two men are able to move it steadily downward. the zombies are very weak, but more creatures appear making it more difficult. then one zombie tries to crawl under the gate. its torso just gets through as the gate slams down against its chest. its arms grab for peter's legs and its mouth is gasping. its body is preventing the gate from engaging in the floor mechanisms. roger lets go the cage as peter tries to hold it against the creatures outside. grabbing his rifle, roger brings the butt straight down on the clutching zombie's skull. the zombie goes limp. then roger tries to push the creature clear of the gate, but the pressure is too great.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{let up a little... let up a little...}
<A>__{the gate rises a few inches. more zombies appear outside. their hands clutch at the roll gate. the openings in the grid are only big enough for their fingers, their hands can't reach through, but they are pushing the gate higher and higher... more than peter intended to clear the obstructing corpse. with his rifle butt, roger manages to push the dead zombie clear except for one of its arms. from outside, a creature's hand suddenly grabs roger's weapon. for a moment its like a tug o war. peter is having a harder time holding the gate. it is inching upward.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{come on... come on...}
<A>__{roger lets go his gun barrel and the weapon is snatched away by the creature in the crowd. roger grabs for the gate.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{the arm... that arm's in the way.}
<A>__{roger squats again and manages to throw the dead zombie's arm clear. then he grabs the gate again. now it starts to move down more steadily. at the last moment, another clutching arm juts into the store, but when the gate hits it, it withdraws, and the big cage clicks solidly into place. the two troopers step back from the gate. the creatures still moan and gurgle, slamming against the gate, their fingers clutching at the grid, but they are unable to budge it. there are ten or twelve zombies trying to get into the department store and several others are making their way along the balcony. at least six lie dead along the floor.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{well... we're in... now, how the hell we gonna get back?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{let's go shoppin' first.}
<A>__{the two men back into the aisles of the store. the creatures outside still push and claw at the gate. the one with roger's rifle uses it as a bludgeon, but it has no effect.}
