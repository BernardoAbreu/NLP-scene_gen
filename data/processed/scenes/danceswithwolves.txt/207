<L>__{exterior battlefield day}
<A>__{dances with wolves climbs to his feet and discovers that the battlefield is no longer so. the fighting has stopped. it's a scene of carnage and joy. the pawnee attackers lay where they fell.}
<C>__{sioux 1}
<D>__{i killed this one.}
<C>__{sioux 2}
<D>__{this one still breathes.}
<A>__{the sioux victors are in high spirits as they hop around finishing off the wounded and counting coup on the dead. dances with wolves looks down at himself. his body is streaked with blood, much of it his own. his arm is bleeding freely but he is too repulsed to move forward and too exhausted to retreat into the breaks. dances with wolves now looks up to see the lifeless body of stone calf. ten bears is hugging him. pretty shield starts to kneel beside her mourning husband.}
<C>__{sioux 3 }
<D>__{dances with wolves...}
<A>__{before he knows it, sioux fighters are moving all around him, chanting his name. like ants rolling a pebble up a hill, they push him into the middle of the battlefield. in a daze he allows himself to be carried along. when he looks up again he can see women and children emerging from the lodges.}
<C>__{dances with wolves }
<D>__{it was hard to know how to feel. i had never been in a battle like this one. this had not been a fight for territory or riches or to make men free. this battle had no ego. it had been fought to preserve the food stores that would see us through winter, to protect the lives of women and children and loved ones only a few feet away. i felt a pride i had never felt before.}
<A>__{dances with wolves looks down and recognizes the face of a man he has just killed. several warriors are crowding around him now. dances with wolves points at the body.}
<C>__{dances with wolves}
<D>__{i shot this one. 1st warrior yes, i saw you shoot him. 2nd warrior you killed that one too.}
<A>__{as the sun breaks fully through the clouds, the little knot of warriors, dances with wolves in their midst, continues its triumphant tour of the battleground. the men are hugging and slapping each other on the back.}
<C>__{dances with wolves }
<D>__{i had never really known who john dunbar was. perhaps because the name itself had no meaning. but as i heard my sioux name being called over and over, i knew for the first time who i really was.}
