<L>__{interior alike's kitchen afternoon}
<A>__{audrey, still in her housecoat, stares into the refrigerator, transfixed by the mountain of foil covered plates. her eyes are cried out buttons. suddenly she remembers to breathe, and her breaths come raggedly tearing out fresh tears. she yanks a foil covered plate, dumps its contents into the trash can and tosses the plate into the sink. she dumps another and another, her composure returning with each plate tossed. by the time she gets to the last one, her breathing slows and returns to normal. she disappears into the bedroom and reappears with the red shopping bag. she calmly lifts out the pink blouse and stuffs it into the garbage. she wads up the shopping bag and stuffs it in too. she takes a deep breath and wipes her sleeve across her nose.}
