<B>__{bad day at black rock}
<A>__{establishing shot black rock part of town: focal point:}
<B>__{railroad station}
<A>__{abandoned, in an extreme state of dilapidation. the structure is blistered by the resolute sun, the roof is weather warped. dry rot and mildew wage a relentless battle against the foundation. between the building and the tracks is a long, somewhat narrow platform, its floorboards twisted by time, termites and the elements. the match board overhang of the building, throwing some little shade to a portion of the platform, sags and bellies. from the overhang is appended a rectangular panel on which, in flaky paint, the town is identified:}
<B>__{black rock}
<A>__{one of the broken wires holding the panel is longer than the other, cocking the sign irregularly. the railroad tracks reach endlessly into the horizon. past the town on each side stretches the ocean like prairie, with sand dunes rising and falling monotonously, shouldering each other toward infinity. the morning sun lays over this wasteland of the american southwest, a gigantic yellow bruise from which heat waves like bloodshot arteries spread themselves over the poisoned sky. a small shack stands next to the station, separated from it by a narrow alleyway and leaning toward the larger building, as if for support. the words postal telegraph are arced across its dusty vitrine. an old straight backed chair, reinforced with twisted wire, is tilted against the north west corner of the shack. in it is mr. hastings, the postal telegraph agent, a man of middle years and exorbitant mediocrity. he sits there spinelessly, fingering a wart on his receding chin and, once in a while, for variety, rubbing a knuckle under his watery nose. full shot black rock the town is minute, dismal and forgotten, crouching in isolation where the single line of railroad track intersects a secondary dirt road. the twin strips of steel glisten in the fierce sunlight, fencing the dreary plain from the false fronts of the town. in b.g. is the bluff of a black stony mountain. against this ancient mass the houses of black rock's single street (see map, p.2a) are scanty in number and insignificant in architecture, a conglomerate paint peeled modern trussed together with rusty nails and battered tin strips torn from signs. the town and the terrain surrounding it have, if nothing else, the quality of inertia and immutibility nothing moves, not even an insect; nothing breathes, not even the wind. town and terrain seem to be trapped, caught and held forever in the sullen, abrasive earth.}
<B>__{out}
<A>__{sequence from original script. straight shot streamliner jarring in its power as it ramrods across the desert, its diesel engines pounding. its horn "wonks" twice, blasting the shatterable air. full shot black rock another angle nothing is changed, nothing is altered. but look close and you will see a small shallow current of wind sweeping lazily across the dirt and dust of the single street. hold for a beat, then main title appears. between the ensuing credits}
