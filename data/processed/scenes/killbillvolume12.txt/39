<L>__{interior backseat of buck's truck night}
<A>__{the bride pulls herself up into the backseat of buck's pickup truck. once in the backseat, she shoves the wheelchair away. it rolls out of control down the parking ramp, and crashes. now the bride's lying vertically in buck's truck's backseat. seemingly out of danger at least out of sight but she's still stuck hiding in the hospital. and until she regains full use of her legs and feet, this little bride ain't goin anywhere or doin anything. lying flat, with the back of her head propped up against the door, her long, lifeless legs stretched out in front of her, her two bare feet at the end of them, pointing to the sky, the bride focusses her eyes, her stare, her thoughts, her strength, and all her concentration....on her big toe.}

<B>__{title sequence}
<A>__{for what looks like a 60's television show about an all girl hit squad, complete with its own lalo shiffrin theme music. against a bright orange background, a snake with six heads (all different breeds), done in a cool but low budget speed racer style of animation, rears its heads to strike. the image freezes... and the show's title (in an especially cool font) and logo (the black silhouette of five sexy gals each with a samurai sword hanging from their hip, and one guy in a black suit) appear beneath it.}
