<L>__{exterior interior buchman living room continuous.}
<A>__{kym crosses the back terrace and enters the living room through the flower bedecked canopy.... where she finds rachel and sidney slow dancing alone and dreamy in the center of the darkened room, the walls still covered with the ceremonial flowers. a single candle flickers nearby. the dancers are oblivious to kym's presence.}
<C>__{kym}
<P>__{(to rachel)}
<D>__{hi. where's mom?}
<A>__{rachel has her head on sidney's shoulder, her eyes closed.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{taking a break.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{how can you take a break from your own daughter's wedding?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{mom doesn't actually participate in things.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{and anyway, she hasn't even done anything all day.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i was thinking about getting her a cat. cats are really annoying. at some point you have to deal with them, right? or they starve to death and piss on your sheets.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{it's so nice here.}
<A>__{suddenly kieran sweeps into the room.}
<C>__{kieran}
<D>__{you can run but you can't hide!}
<A>__{kym shrieks as kieran grabs her and plants a wet one on her, dipping her to the floor. they careen into sidney and rachel. sidney grabs rachel and starts molesting her.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(totally into it)}
<D>__{stop! stop you fiend!}
<A>__{rachel and sidney fall to the floor writhing, sounding way too amorous. then:}
<C>__{abby's voice off}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{the ceiling light flicks on overhead and abby enters the living room. blinking against the light, rachel struggles to her feet smoothing her dress.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{mom!}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{here you are.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(from the floor)}
<D>__{hello abby. you're lovely. and i'm not looking up your skirt.}
<A>__{kieran is busting a gut not to laugh.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i've been looking for you all over the place.}
<C>__{andrew's voice off}
<D>__{abby? where are you?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i'm in here.}
<A>__{andrew pops his head in.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{they're bringing the car around.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{all right.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you're leaving?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{darling, i'm exhausted. i had such a marvelous time. those dancers were so beautiful. but weddings are really for young people.}
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{i thought we'd just sneak off and not make a big scene.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you could make a little scene.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{and here i am making it. andrew and i are going to washington in the morning.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{why are you going to washington?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{it's the mother of all fund raisers at american. i thought i mentioned it. we're going to stay on about a week there are lots of meetings. i thought since you two are going away soon...}
<P>__{(to kym)}
<D>__{...and i'm sure you don't want any grown ups around checking up on you...will you still be here when i get back?}
<A>__{kym doesn't say anything.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what about our post nuptial wedding gossip reconnaissance, mom?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{well, can you come by early?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{um...}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{of course you don't want to do that. it's your wedding night. you don't want to get up early. i have to get andrew organized. he's hopeless. and we'll be back in a bit. it was such a lovely wedding, darling.}
<A>__{she bends in for a kiss.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{wait! i want my mother and my sister!}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{rachel...}
<A>__{rachel wraps one arm around kym's neck and the other round her mother and hugs them both to her. she has her eyes open. they have their eyes open. they are stiff as boards. rachel stops hugging and looks from one to the other. her mom and sister look at her and each other. beat.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{will you call me every day about...?}
<A>__{she pats rachel's tummy.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{yes. of course.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{all right, then.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{goodbye abby.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{good bye, son in law.}
<A>__{kym and rachel watch their mother leave the room.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{i saw your mother's underwear.}
<A>__{kym sees abby and andrew crossing the front porch through the window.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{i can't find my cigarettes.}
<A>__{kym moves quickly from the room.}
