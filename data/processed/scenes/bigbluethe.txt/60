<A>__{they emerge onto the street in front of the entrance of a small rooming house. jacques is carrying johana's luggage. the old pension is covered in bright pink bougainvilliers, there is laundry hanging on the other side of the street.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{thanks for helping with the bag.}
<P>__{(she looks up at the}
<D>__{pension with little}
<P>__{enthusiasm)}
<D>__{it looks great!}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{i thought it was a nice place.}
<P>__{(suddenly doubting)}
<D>__{isn't it?}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{i'm being a pain in the ass.}
<P>__{(looking at him)}
<D>__{it's beautiful here.}
<A>__{they look at each other. jacques is silent. he just stands there, a suitcase in each hand. johana breaks the silence.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{you're going to be very busy these days aren't you?}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{i don't know... why?}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{just because... i would have liked to visit the town... see the coast... i don't know anybody... expect for you.}
<P>__{(feeling she has gone too far)}
<D>__{but you are going to be very busy. you must have tons of things to prepare, interviews... and a competition like this one must require a great deal of concentration, right?}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(shakes his head negatively)}
<D>__{yes... maybe... i don't know. i don't like competitions... it ruins the fun. don't you think?}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(with a faint smile)}
<D>__{i guess... but you know... i'm american and i've mostly been taught to be competitive... there's always pleasure of being the best?}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... you see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it. it's a feeling... i don't know how to say this... voluptuous?}
<A>__{he looks up at her as he pronounces the last word. she smiles at him, lovingly.}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{you can put down the suitcases, you know.}
<A>__{he lets go of the suitcases. suddenly, behind them, there is a loud screech of tires. the fiat tears across the street. enzo in his fiat. he pokes his head out of the window.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{c'mon, you two... jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight. we have a new world champion.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{i'm a little tired, i don't know if...}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{get in the car!}
