<D>__{mcginty stop worrying. the n.f.l. doesn't care if he played under an assumed name. everything was legal. he was let out on a work release program. he'll be kept under house arrest but he'll still be able to play.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{where are we gonna keep him? mcginty in the stadium. we'll fix up something comfortable for him and he'll get his exercise by kicking the shit out of n.f.l. receivers.}

<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{the hell i do! i'm dying! let 'em sue me. mcginty they'll do worse than that. they'll close down the stadium.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{god damn 'em! then you got to beat dallas. the whole country will be watching. all those millionaires down there deserve to have their noses rubbed in it. mcginty ed, let's be honest: beating dallas is gonna be a hell of a trick.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{you can pull it off. you proved that winning doesn't have to look pretty. these boys are hungry for it, jimmy.}
<C>__{o'neil }
<D>__{there's nothin' more dangerous in all of sports than a hungry team. i remember back in '47, we were playing nebraska in the mud... mcginty}
