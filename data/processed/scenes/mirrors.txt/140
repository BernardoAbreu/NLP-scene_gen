<A>__{in the dark, the surface of the water lies perfectly still. we are no longer in the new jersey house, but in the subterranean passageways corridors of the department store. ben and anna's silhouettes appear, walking down the stairs. ben turns on his flashlight. the lights along the corridor are too weak.}

<D>__{watch your step, a water pipe has burst, the whole basement is flooded.}
<A>__{ben guides anna, with her eyes still shut, through the tunnels. the beam of the flashlight sweeps across the walls, and the piping. they pass the junction of the two tunnels and arrive at the demolished wall.}
