<L>__{interior night. moor house a bedroom}
<A>__{dinah and mary are gently taking jane's soaking clothes off; one at each side of her. jane is distressed, approaching a delirium. she resists them.}
<L>__{interior dusk. gateshead the red room.}
<A>__{jane is carried in and set down on a footstool by two servants, miss abbot and bessie one at each side of her. she is still resisting.}
<C>__{bessie}
<D>__{for shame, hitting your master.}
<C>__{miss abbot}
<D>__{if you don't sit still you must be tied down!}
<A>__{the fight goes out of jane. she sits, defeated. bessie, young and plump, quickly wipes her bleeding forehead. she has some compassion. miss abbot has none.}
<C>__{bessie}
<D>__{what we do is for your own good. if you are passionate and rude like this, your aunt reed will send you away.}
<C>__{miss abbot}
<D>__{you're worse than us servants. we work for our keep; you do nothing. pray for forgiveness miss eyre or something bad will come down that chimney and fetch you away.}
<A>__{the door slams. they are gone. jane slowly grips the edge of the stool. the room is chill, silent. red walls and curtains, murky in the fading light. in front of jane, a stone fireplace gapes like a mouth. beside it, a full length looking glass in which her pale reflection stares out. behind her, a bed supported on pillars of mahogany, hung with red. the piled up pillows and mattresses glare in cold white. jane's breathing is the only sound in the room. a sudden gust sends rain pelting against the windows like fingernails. a distant moan of wind seems to breathe out of the black hearth. jane reverts her nervous gaze to the pitted mirror. her eyes lock on the small figure trapped in the mirror's visionary hollow; her white, bleeding face, her eyes glittering with fear. it is a phantom. the eyes are black, the skin a deathly grey. blood. jane's breathing becomes choked with terror. she can't get her breath. we hear blood rushing through her ears. it sounds like the beating of great wings. slowly, a light appears over her. it may be something shining in from outside. but to jane it seems as if it is surrounding her, enveloping her. the figure in the looking glass opens its mouth. the scream, held in so long, finally rips from jane's throat.}
