<L>__{interior matt's bedroom continuous}
<A>__{matt, in his late teens, has a very short buzz cut. he's wearing an old t shirt and faded cargo shorts, and he's sitting up on the edge of his unmade bed. matt's bedroom is a shithole, with dirty clothes piled everywhere. he's talking into a cordless phone, using his free hand to rub the back of his neck nervously.}

<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{yeah, it's jimmy!}
<A>__{we cut back and forth between jimmy and matt. matt is now pacing back and forth in his shithole room. his voice is hushed, although the sense of urgency in it is obvious. jimmy's still talking loud, as his piece of shit does not provide a quiet ride.}
