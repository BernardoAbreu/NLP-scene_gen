<A>__{the sound of television static leaks as the camera moves into the last bedroom. robbie freeling is just a seven year old lump under the covers. with the sheets tucked around him, he looks like a ghost and where his head should be there is a dodgers baseball cap. the closet light is on and the closet opened only a crack to let in the safe night light as we pass beyond robbie to carol anne freeling. the static sounds from the o.s. tv seem to arouse this pert six years old from a sound and regular sleep. her eyes snap open. she listens, flicks some sleep from her eyes, and rises out of bed. camera tracks ahead of her as if drawing her outside the safety of her bedroom and roommate brother.}
