<L>__{interior flushing meadow park. night.}
<A>__{from a vantage point in a disused tower high above the park. christof and chloe watch as truman's oldsmobile enters the park grounds and comes to a stop near the large metal framed globe, the unisphere. both christof and chloe wear earpieces, a miniature television propped at their feet shows a close up picture of truman and veronica inside the car.}
<C>__{chloe}
<P>__{(into a flip phone, condescending)}
<D>__{...you see him messing with the antenna...what did you think would happen?... "lapse of concentration", is that what you call it? i call it amateur hour...}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{in case you hadn't noticed, we don't get to do it over.}
<A>__{christof, totally unfazed, regards his zealous young assistant with affection and even a mild amusement.}
<C>__{chloe}
<P>__{(as she hangs up, querying the smile that plays around his lips)}
<D>__{you think this is funny?}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{the mask has slipped before. everything can be explained.}
<A>__{truman kills the lights and he and veronica exit the car unaware that they are being observed.}
<C>__{christof}
<P>__{(adopting a more serious tone as he returns his attention to truman)}
<D>__{what's dangerous is that he makes the connection between what happened today and the girl .}
<A>__{we focus on truman and veronica as they take a seat at the edge of the pool surrounding the great steel globe.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{like i say, i don't normally do this. i gotta charge extra.}
<A>__{truman nods his agreement and forks over several bills. veronica deposits the money in her purse and perches herself as modestly as possible on the edge of the fountain. when she is ready, truman tenderly places his arm around her shoulder. veronica responds, hesitantly, becoming immersed in her role. she reaches out her own hand and rests it on the nape of his neck. slowly both heads drift together, but stop just short of their lips meeting, agonizingly close. so close they can feel each other's breath, barely a sliver of daylight separating them. then finally their lips touch in the most gentle of caresses. they hold the kiss for another long moment and then simultaneously break. as they look into each other's eyes, truman goes to say something but veronica hushes him by placing a finger to his lips. then abruptly she moves out of frame, the cardigan falling from around her shoulders in her haste. from truman's pov we focus on the cardigan on the pavement, triggering a flashback in his head.}
