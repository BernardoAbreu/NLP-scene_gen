<A>__{on video: jane lays in ricky's bed, wearing a tank top. she glances at us.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(shy)}
<D>__{don't.}
<A>__{we're watching the wide screen tv in ricky's room. a cord leads from the tv to ricky's digicam. ricky holds the camera, sitting naked in a chair. it's been almost a month since his father beat him up, and there are still slight scars on his face. he's aiming his camera at jane.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(re: image on tv)}
<D>__{it's weird, watching myself. i don't like how i look.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{i can't believe you don't know how beautiful you are.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i'm not going to sit here for that shit.}
<A>__{she gets out of bed, takes his digicam and focuses it on him. we see his image on the tv as she videotapes.}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{ha. how does it feel now?}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you don't feel naked?}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{i am naked.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you know what i mean.}
<A>__{jane zooms in on his face, which remains placid.}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{tell me about being in the hospital.}
<A>__{ricky smiles.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{when i was fifteen, my dad caught me smoking dope. he totally freaked and decided to send me to military school. i told you his whole thing about structure and discipline, right?}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{well, of course, i got kicked out. dad and i had this huge fight, and he hit me... and then the next day at school, some kid made a crack about my haircut, and... i just snapped. i wanted to kill him. and i would have. killed him. if they hadn't pulled me off.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{that's when my dad put me in the hospital. then they drugged me up and left me in there for two years.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{wow. you must really hate him.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{he's not a bad man.}
<A>__{he grabs a half smoked joint from an ashtray and lights it.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{well... you better believe i'd hate my father if he did something like that to me.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{wait. i do hate my father.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{he passes her the joint, then takes the digicam and focuses it on her. we see her image on the tv as he videotapes.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{he's a total asshole and he's got this crush on my friend angela and it's disgusting.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{you'd rather he had the crush on you?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{gross, no! but it'd be nice if i was anywhere near as important to him as she is.}
<P>__{(then)}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{i know you think my dad's harmless, but you're wrong. he's doing massive psychological damage to me.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{how?}
<A>__{jane looks into the camera, a loopy, stoned grin on her face.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{well, now, i too need structure. a little fucking discipline.}
<A>__{they laugh. she lays back on the bed.}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{i'm serious, though. how could he not be damaging me? i need a father who's a role model, not some horny geek boy who's gonna spray his shorts whenever i bring a girlfriend home from school.}
<P>__{(snorts)}
<D>__{what a lame o. somebody really should put him out of his misery.}
<A>__{her mind wanders for a beat.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{want me to kill him for you?}
<A>__{jane looks at him and sits up.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{yeah, would you?}
<C>__{ricky}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{it'll cost you.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{well, i've been baby sitting since i was about ten. i've got almost three thousand dollars. 'course, i was saving it up for a boob job.}
<A>__{she stands and sticks out her breasts, then falls back on the bed, laughing.}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{but my tits can wait, huh?}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{you know, that's not a very nice thing to do, hiring somebody to kill your dad.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{well, i guess i'm just not a very nice girl, then, am i?}
<A>__{she smiles dreamily at him. he turns the digicam off and the tv screen goes blue. he lowers the camera and looks at her intently.}
<C>__{jane }
<P>__{(suddenly nervous)}
<D>__{you know i'm not serious, right?}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{he puts the digicam down and joins jane on the bed. a long moment where neither of them speaks. he caresses her hair, gazing into her eyes.}
<C>__{ricky }
<D>__{do you know how lucky we are to have found each other?}
