<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior gray sedan night}
<A>__{reese drives with total, nerveless absorption. his eyes flick to the mirror, to the road, over his shoulder, back ...and the world spins outside. with occasional glances to sarah, he speaks to her in a clipped, military voice.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{are you injured? are you shot?}
<A>__{no response. he reaches over and runs his hands over her arms, legs, chest. sarah flinches. she feels the blind panic boiling up within her. she pushes his hand away and opens the door. reese slams her back in the seat and slaps her. hard.}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{do exactly what i say. exactly. don't move un less i say. don't make a sound unless i say. do you understand?}
<A>__{as he speaks he is locking the door and fastening sarah's seatbelt over her, cinching it very tightly, like you would for a child. she doesn't answer.}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(continuing shouting)}
<D>__{do you understand?}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{yes. don't hurt me.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{i'm here to help you. reese, sergeant tech com, dn38416...}
<A>__{sarah stares numbly at his outstretched hand. with zero strength she automatically returns his handshake.}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{assigned to protect you. you've been targetted for termination.}
