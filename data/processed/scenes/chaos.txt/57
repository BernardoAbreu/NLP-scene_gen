<D>__{we got the one teller dead, the two that were strung up are alive, but in critical condition. a few swat incurred 2nd degree burns, but that's the worst of it. now, depending on who you talk to... there was anywhere from five to nine perps. and nobody got a good look at any of'em, wore their masks the whole time. dax is rounding up the security tapes now. that should give us a firm number.}
