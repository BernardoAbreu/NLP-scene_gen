<L>__{exterior lake night}
<A>__{a desolate rural setting. utter silence. moonlight glints on placid waters. we track in on a small sign bearing the legend: "gotham city reservoir." far off in the distance, headlights are approaching.}
<L>__{exterior access road aerial shot moving night}
<A>__{the three cargo trucks from ace chemical roll ominously toward the reservoir on their deadly mission. and then a streaking black shadow enters frame, overtaking the trucks. the batwing! a phenomenal ultralight aircraft, swift, sleek, jet black and infinitely maneuverable, it soars easily past the trucks, swooping low just long enough to release a bomb over a concrete bridge.}
<L>__{exterior access road a moment later}
<A>__{the bridge explodes, blocking the trucks' path to the reservoir. puzzled drivers climb out of their cabs and wonder what to do nexterior they spot the batwing in the distance banking, doing a sharp 180. for a moment they gape in disbelief. then they head for the trees as the batwing dives directly at the trucks, firing three armor piercing shells... and destroying the joker's lethal cargo once and for all.}

<A>__{in the cockpit, his jaw set, not even looking back at the wreckage as his plane screams off toward the gotham skyline.}
