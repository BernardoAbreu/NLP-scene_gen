<A>__{a green set. walls, floor, ceiling all green. a full cast shoots hal, dressed in a futuristic suit, tentatively crossing the green expanse. hal pauses, looks longingly, then impulsively dashes forward. hal passionately embraces thin air and wrestles it to the ground.}
<C>__{viktor }
<D>__{cut! cut!... cut!}
<A>__{hal freezes. viktor runs from behind the camera and confronts hal on the green floor.}
