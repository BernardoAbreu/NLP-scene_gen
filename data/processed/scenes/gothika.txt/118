<L>__{interior secret basement}
<A>__{miranda emerges from the ladder into total darkness. whatever dim reddish light was provided by the bulb upstairs does not reach here. she feels around the wall for a switch. nothing.}
<C>__{miranda}
<P>__{(to self)}
<D>__{it's not shrink appropriate to be afraid of the dark, right?}
<A>__{abruptly there's a sharp click as she lights simon's key chain lighter, and the wavery light illuminates the vast space. rats scurry for cover. it takes a second to orient ourselves. something metallic catches the lighter's reflection way in back. miranda walks towards it.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{she takes a few more steps until her foot hits a bulk on the floor. she stops. kneels down and in the dim half light we make out a backpack. she unzips it and rifles through it (t shirts, underwear, walkman) until she finds a wallet. opens the billfold and brings the lighter next to the id: the picture belongs to a teenager named "tracy marie seaver."}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{is there anybody here? hello?}
<A>__{the lighter in her hand is getting hot, so she lets it click off. when it comes back on we see she has wrapped a ragged t shirt around it for insulation. miranda steps deeper into the room. up ahead, she can make out the metallic thing that reflected light before. it is a hook in the ceiling. and suspended from it are several heavy chains. like a meat rack. and now she catches a whiff of the terrible smell and sees the body of the teenage girl: hanging upside down, tied around the hands and ankles. medical training kicking in, miranda quickly lowers the girl to the ground, causing the angry rats to skitter away.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{go away! fuck off!}
<A>__{(we see the following in between flicks of the lighter so that we go from midnight black to wavery light in an almost strobe light effect:) she checks for vital signs, pulse, heartbeat miranda's adrenaline at full tilt }
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{c'mon, c'mon, c'mon }
<A>__{she strikes the flint and brings the lighter to the girl's pupils. inspects them. slaps her repeatedly, clinically. the strobe effect also allows us glimpses of the immediate surroundings: household tools strewn about; wire cutters, pliers a pool of dried blood.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{wake up, tracy, wake up }
<A>__{nothing. she unties the wires around the girl's ankles. the skin swollen grotesquely around them. she shakes the girl. slowly coming to the realization that it's too late.}
