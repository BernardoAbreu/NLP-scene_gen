<A>__{lisa is sat with delaney, both nursing a cup of coffee.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{you told me the other night that you think evil is within us all. but do you think that people can be influenced by an evil that comes from outside of themselves?}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{are you still thinking about this?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i guess i am yeah.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{i worry that you're thinking too much. this place is getting to you.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{there's something going on in this place. something sinister. and i don't just mean the patients on ward x. have you not noticed that?}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{i've noticed some things.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{why haven't you said anything? or done anything?}
<A>__{delaney contemplates for a moment.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{it's like the honey bee.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{the honey bee is fine when it's just flying from flower to flower. then they think that a person is a threat and they sting them. they might leave a sting but the person will recover. the bee dies. so i ask myself... is it worth it?}
<A>__{delaney returns his attention to the cup of coffee in his hands as lisa disappears into her own thoughts.}
