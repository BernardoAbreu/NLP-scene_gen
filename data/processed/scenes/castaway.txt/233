<L>__{exterior raft day later}
<A>__{the raft drifts. chuck has taken down the sail and rigged it as a canopy. drenched with sweat, chuck lies on the raft, trying to sleep. he dabs at some sores that are ulcerating his body and won't let him get comfortable. plus, there's a chaffing, squeaking sound. he looks around for the source. we see it with him. one of the ropes is frayed and about to break. if it does, the logs will come apart from the floats.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{shit! shit! shit!}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{stay calm, identify the problem. problem, rope fraying. solution, fix rope.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{with what? there's nothing to fix it with. this rope comes undone, you're going to drown.}
<C>__{good chuck}
<D>__{just get up and fix it.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{too tired.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{get up.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{feels so good to lie here.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{get up, damn you.}
<A>__{chuck comes to his knees. then sinks back down.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{can't. need water.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{you've had today's water.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{thirsty.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{no water, no work.}
<A>__{chuck tries another tack. sweet reason.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{okay look, i know you're tired, i know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{do too much, i will die.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{do too little you'll die.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{going to die anyway.}
<A>__{that stops goodchuck for a moment.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{okay, look have an extra swallow.}
<A>__{he holds up the pathetic little jar with its few teaspoons of murky water.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{no more water, you said.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{take it.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{take it, damn it.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{wilson, do you believe this? take the damn water.}
<A>__{slowly chuck gets up, lifts up the water jar, and takes a swallow. then another.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{stop. enough.}
<A>__{then another.}
