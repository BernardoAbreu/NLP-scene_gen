<A>__{anthony and dignan are inside walking through the foyer. anthony goes up the stairway quickly and quietly. dignan walks to the master bedroom. goes in the closet and grabs a box. looks inside. dumps it into his bag. anthony goes into a bedroom. looks in a dresser and takes out two watches. digs through some socks and finds some cash. dignan goes in the study. opens a drawer and closes it. opens another and lifts out a set of thin leather coin books. anthony's in a kid's room. looking at posters of a football player and john mcenroe on the walls. he grabs a walkman and a calculator. then suddenly stops moving. he crouches down. looks at a shelf of dozens of little metal soldiers. they're in formations with different uniforms. dignan is walking down the hallway as anthony comes down the stairs. they walk to the door and go out.}
