<A>__{margaret crosses to one of the drawers. she reaches in and takes out a long carving knife; it gleams in the light.}

<L>__{exterior school parking lot night}
<A>__{the school gymnasium is lit up brightly for the prom; cars are pulling in, among them, tommy's ford.}
<L>__{interior tommy's car}
<A>__{as tommy turns off the ignition. carrie's staring at the other couples getting out of their cars. tommy watches her taking it all in.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{it's like a dream.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{you can still change your mind, you know.}
<A>__{she turns to him and realizes he's teasing her.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{easier said than done.}
<C>__{tommy}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{c'mon.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{no. please not yet.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{scared?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{can we sit here another minute?}
<A>__{tommy laughs and nods. a moment of silence. carrie is miserable she's happy to be with tommy, she's trying to have a good time, but it's hard. it's like getting up to dance the first time. perhaps it would be better to sit this one out.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{tommy...}
<P>__{(and then out it comes)}
<D>__{maybe... maybe this was a mistake.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{hey, it won't be so bad.}
<A>__{she tries to smile at him. it's not very persuasive.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{really, i mean it. they're okay, you'll see.}
<P>__{(beat; she's trying to believe him)}
<D>__{don't be nervous. besides...}
<P>__{(a little self mocking)}
<D>__{i'd look awfully silly dancing by myself.}
<A>__{and that's just enough he's taken her mind off her own fear just enough to make her laugh.}
