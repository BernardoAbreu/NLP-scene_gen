<A>__{john sits slumped in the chair, drained. steam rises off his skin. angela sees the water in the bucket has almost all boiled out. she walks in, kneels down to him.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{john? what happened?}
<A>__{sweat drips off as he looks up. he opens his palm reveals to angela a simple hospital band. the name "isabel dodson" is typed on it. even as a semi convert, this news completely floors angela. she takes the plastic band grips it tight tries to hold herself together. the adrenaline and pain overwhelm. her knee buckle and she drops to the floor. john watches, isn't sure how to help. he finally reaches out a single hand slowly rests it on her shoulder. the contact seems to open a floodgate of emotion and angela falls right into his arms. john hasn't been this close to anyone in a long time. angela finally composes herself.}
