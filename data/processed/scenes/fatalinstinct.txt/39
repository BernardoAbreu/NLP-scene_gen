<A>__{the wind blows. thunder and lightning! rain pours down. ned and lola, both in yellow rain slickers, ravish each other lustfully on the roof, sliding down the incline of shingles. oblivious to the peril, they slip right over the edge! they hang from the eaves trough, each clutching it with one hand while still holding one another with their free arms... kissing passionately. the trough breaks! they fall! angle the ground below they roll out of the bushes onto the lawn, arms and legs entangled. they fall apart, gasping for breath. a beat.}
