<L>__{interior train a bit later}
<A>__{joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the slowly passing desolate terrain. after a moment the door between cars opens and clementine enters. joel looks up. clementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deciding where to sit. she settles on a seat at the opposite end of the car. joel looks out the window. he feels her watching him. the train is picking up speed. finally:}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(calling over the rumble)}
<D>__{hi!}
<A>__{joel looks over.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{why what?}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{why are you sorry? i just said hi.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{no, i didn't know if you were talking to me, so...}
<A>__{she looks around the empty car.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{joel}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{well, i didn't want to assume.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{aw, c'mon, live dangerously. take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{anyway. sorry. hi.}
<A>__{clementine makes her way down the aisle towards joel.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{it's okay if i sit closer? so i don't have to scream. not that i don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{but i don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{no, i mean, i don't know. i can't really think of much to say probably.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{oh. so...}
<A>__{she hesitates in the middle of the car, looks back where she came from.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. i didn't mean to }
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{no, i don't want to bug you if you're trying to }
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{it's okay, really.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. i have a long trip ahead of me.}
<P>__{(sits across aisle from joel)}
<D>__{how far are you going? on the train, i mean, of course.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{rockville center.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{get out! me too! what are the odds?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{the weirder part is i think actually i recognize you. i thought that earlier in the diner. that's why i was looking at you. you work at borders, right?}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{ucch, really? you're kidding. god. bizarre small world, huh? yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{really? because }
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{jesus, is it five years? i gotta quit right now.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{ because i go there all the time. i don't think i ever saw you before.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{well, i'm there. i hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. you have a cell phone? i need to quit right this minute. i will call in dead.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i don't have one.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i will go on the dole. like my daddy before me.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i noticed your hair. i guess it made an impression on me, that's why i was pretty sure i recognized you.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{ah, the hair.}
<P>__{(pulls a strand in front of her eyes, studies it)}
<D>__{blue, right? it's called blue ruin. the color. snappy name, huh?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i like it.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{yeah. tom waits says it in }
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{exactly! tom waits. which song?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i can't remember.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. red menace, yellow fever, green revolution. that'd be a job, coming up with those names. how do you get a job like that? that's what i will do. fuck the dole.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i don't really know how }
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{purple haze, pink eraser.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{you think that could possibly be a full time job? how many hair colors could there be?}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(pissy)}
<D>__{someone's got that job.}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{agent orange! i came up with that one. anyway, there are endless color possibilities and i'd be great at it.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i'm sure you would.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{my writing career! your hair written by clementine kruczynski.}
<P>__{(thought)}
<D>__{the tom waits album is rain dogs.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{you sure? that doesn't sound }
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i think. anyway, i've tried all their colors. more than once. i'm getting too old for this. but it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. i apply my personality in a paste. you?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{oh, i doubt that's the case.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{sorry. i was just trying to be nice.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{yeah, i got it.}
<A>__{there's a silence.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{my name's clementine, by the way.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i'm joel.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{no jokes about my name? oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i don't know any jokes about your name.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{huckleberry hound?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i don't know what that means.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{huckleberry hound! what, are you nuts?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i'm nut nuts.}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' clementine? no?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{sorry. it's a pretty name, though. it means "merciful", right?}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{yeah. although it hardly fits. i'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{see, i wouldn't think that about you.}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(pissy)}
<D>__{why wouldn't you think that about me?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{oh. i don't know. i was just... i don't know. i was... you seemed nice, so }
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{now i'm nice? don't you know any other adjectives? there's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{well, anyway... sorry.}
<A>__{they sit in silence for a while.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i just don't think "nice" is a particularly interesting thing to be.}
<A>__{the conductor enters the car.}
<C>__{conductor}
<D>__{tickets.}
<A>__{joel hands the conductor his ticket. the conductor punches it and hands it back.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{what is nice, anyway? i mean, besides an adjective? i guess it can be an adverb, sort of.}
<A>__{the conductor turns to clementine. she fishes in her bag.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{it doesn't reveal anything. nice is pandering. cowardly.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{and life is more interesting than that. or should be. jesus god, i hope it is... someday.}
<P>__{(to conductor)}
<D>__{i know it's here.}
<A>__{the conductor and joel watch as she gets more agitated.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{i don't need nice. i don't need myself to be it and i don't need anyone else to be it at me.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{shit. shit. i know it's here. hold on.}
<A>__{she dumps the contents of the bag onto the seat and sifts frantically through. joel sees the book she was reading in the diner. it's the play by stephen dixon.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{damn it. damn it!}
<P>__{(there it is)}
<D>__{oh. here.}
<A>__{she hands the conductor the tickets, smiles sweetly. he punches it, hands it back to her, and walks away.}
<C>__{conductor}
<D>__{next stop southampton.}
<A>__{the conductor heads into the next car. clementine shoves stuff back into her purse. her hands are a little shaky. she pulls a airline sized bottle of alcohol from her pocket, opens it, and downs it. joel is watching all of this but pretending not to. she looks out the window for a while. the train pulls into the station. the doors open. nobody gets on. the doors close. the train pulls out.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{joel? it's joel, right?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i'm sorry i... yelled at you. was it yelling? i can't really tell. whatever, i'm a little out of sorts today.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{that's okay.}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(stares out window)}
<D>__{my embarrassing admission is i really like that you're nice. right now, anyway. i can't tell from one moment to the next what i'm going to like. but right now i'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. that was nice of you.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{it's no problem. anyway, i have some stuff i need to }
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{oh, okay. well, sure, i will just...}
<P>__{(stands, throws bag over shoulder)}
<D>__{take care, then.}
<C>__{joel}
<P>__{(pulling journal from briefcase)}
<D>__{probably see you at the book store.}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(heading toward other end of car)}
<D>__{unless i get that hair color naming job.}
<A>__{clementine sits and stares out the window.}
