<L>__{interior the gym night}
<A>__{the party is underway. streamers everywhere, tables by the windows. couples dance, a d.j spins the tunes. there is a setup in one corner for taking prom pictures. the kids are all very elegant and hip. every shade of black is represented. angle punch bowl nicole and kimberly stand by the punch bowl, chatting. they are both wearing slinky little black dresses. angle the door there are two: at one end, leading to the house (it's closed) and one leading outside. gary murray stands by the outside door, on guard, as students enter. he is looking disdainfully at andy and holding a flask he has confiscated.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{well, it came with the tux.}
<A>__{buffy enters the gym. she is wearing a long white strapless gown. it is lovely, but very conservative for this crowd. over her shoulder is a purse that goes with the dress. she enters hesitantly, looking around her for jeffrey. she passes andy, who is moving away from gary murray.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{buffy! looking tasty.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{thanks. have you seen jeffrey?}
<A>__{but andy has moved on. buffy works her way through the crowd to the punch bowl, sees nicole and kimberly. they stop whispering real quick.}
<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hi, guys.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{buffy}

<D>__{you look way pretty, kim.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{i know. i like your little outfit.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{it's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{as long as there's room for three in it. what, didn't you bring your new friends?}
<A>__{buffy is startled by this attack. nicole giggles.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{i guess you guys are mad at me. i'm sorry. i've been really }
<A>__{jeffrey suddenly appears between them. jennifer is on his arm.}
<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{jeffrey! there you are. i }
<A>__{she stops, as everybody assesses the situation. buffy is shocked, doing a slow fade to hurt. jeffrey is uncomfortable. jennifer is apoplectic with embarrassment. kimberly is in serious giggle, nicole a bit more restrained, checking it out.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{buffy, what are you doing here?}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{i thought we were meeting here.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{i'm here with jenny.}
<A>__{ who is practically hyperventilating, pulling at his arm like a dog on a leash.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{oh, come on, buffy. you know what's going on. it's not working out at all. i've got to move on. i mean, i've got needs, too. i told you about all this.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{no, you didn't. when?}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{didn't you get my message?}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{you broke up with my machine?}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{you weren't home. like always.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{you left me a message?}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{i'm out of here. jenny.}
<A>__{at the mention of her name jenny jumps, and in her haste to get away, she bumps into buffy's arm, spilling bright red punch on buffy's chest. she flees, jeffrey in tow. they leave the gym. kimberly finds it all pretty funny. nicole is silent. buffy turns away, toward the wall. a soft ballad come on over the speakers. tears are forming in buffy's eyes, as she wipes futilely at her dress. finally she turns, looks toward the door. buffy's pov pike is there, walking in on his own. he wears a leather jacket and baggy old tux pants, accented by chains, earring and unlaced doc martins. he looks great. he walks directly toward buffy, and does turn a few heads.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{i crashed your party.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{pretty shallow of you.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{that's me.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{i'm glad you came.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.}
<A>__{pike picks up a glass of punch as he notices the stain on buffy's dress. he looks about him a bit, then without hesitation dumps some punch on his lapel, matching stains. buffy smiles at him.}
<C>__{pike}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{will i get the shit kicked out of me if i ask you to dance?}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{i don't actually think jeffrey's gonna notice.}
<A>__{they begin slow dancing, not too close.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{yeah, well, you're the one i'm afraid of.}
<A>__{they dance for a while, closer and closer.}
<C>__{pike}
<P>__{(continuing; gee whizzically)}
<D>__{you know, you're not like the other girls.}
<A>__{buffy pulls him closer, holds him, whispers almost weakly in his ear.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{yes, i am.}
<A>__{we see couples dancing, kissing... gary murray watching them. angle kimberly sitting by the window with her bovine date, she watches buffy dance disdainfully.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{i can't believe it.}
<A>__{the window shatters by her head, a vampire's hand reaching for her. she screams, starts back. other windows shatter, vampires appearing all around. a couple of students run for the inner door but it is locked shut from the other side. gradually the party stops as everybody becomes aware of the situation. they vaguely herd to the middle of the room. angle buffy and pike looking around, assessing the situation. angle outer door a student runs staggering in, blood spurting from his neck.}
<C>__{bloody student}
<D>__{they're out there! they're vampires! god, help me!}
<A>__{he falls to the ground, a few feet in front of the doorway. nobody moves for a second. then one of the students starts toward the body.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{don't go near the door.}
<A>__{buffy does instead, checking the lifeless body and listening as a number of figures begin to lumber toward the door through the mist. buffy steps back as three 17 year old vampire come to the door.}
<D>__{1st vampire it's party time.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{don't worry! they can't come in here. they can't come in unless they're invited.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{i already invited them.}
<A>__{everyone looks at her.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<P>__{(continuing; defensively)}
<D>__{they're seniors!}
<A>__{pike reaches into an inner pocket and pulls out a number of small stakes he has made, hands them to buffy. she opens her purse. angle inside the purse cosmetics, hair spray, etc. she fits the stakes in.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{the first thing we should 1st vampire buffy... you wanna dance?}
<C>__{pike}
<P>__{(to buffy)}
<D>__{looks like you're busted. 2nd vampire we want her! we want buffy. send her out. 1st vampire or we come in.}
<A>__{they fade back, almost out of sight. pike looks out the window. more are gathering.}
<C>__{gary murray}
<D>__{all right, everybody stay calm.}
<P>__{(to buffy)}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{looks bad, buffy.}
<C>__{senior girl}
<D>__{send her out.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{they'll kill us! she's the one they're mad at.}
<C>__{senior boy}
<D>__{yeah! send her out!}
<C>__{gary murray}
<D>__{everybody be quiet!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{what, are you kidding? they'll kill her!}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{they'll kill us!}
<C>__{pike}
<P>__{(moving toward kimberly, fist raised)}
<D>__{you want some punch?}
<C>__{gary murray}
<D>__{i got detention slips here, i'm not afraid to use them...}
<A>__{but other students have picked up the cry, are clamoring to sacrifice buffy. pike crosses to his bag, sitting by the door. two guys move toward buffy, andy intervenes. pike steps in front of buffy, holding his custom made cartridge load crossbow. trains it on the others. they quiet down.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{there's gotta be a back way out of here, or something.}
<A>__{buffy looks at the partygoers. her friends. they stare back at her, scared, angry. she looks out the door. back at her friends.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{i'm going out the front.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{are you nuts, buffy? there's a hundred of them out there. they'll rip us apart.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{you're staying here.}
<P>__{(before he can speak)}
<D>__{some of them might not come after me. if they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{you say that like it's a bad thing.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{buffy, this is crazy. what do these guys want?}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{andy, start breaking up some chairs. you'll need weapons.}
<A>__{andy looks at her a moment, moves off. buffy goes to pike's bag, starts pulling out stakes.}
<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{good thing one of us was prepared.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.}
<A>__{buffy stands up. she kisses pike very hard on the lips.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{don't piss me off.}
<A>__{she kneels down, begins to rip the hem of her dress.}
