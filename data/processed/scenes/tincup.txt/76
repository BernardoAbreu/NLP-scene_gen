<D>__{excuse me, dor', the man's having trouble with his grip }
<A>__{the guy slides over to tin cup, quickly joined by his buddies.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{see, i used to play a real weak grip. but you look at couples, he's got a left hand way over here...}
<A>__{tin cup glances at the guy's grip.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{no, grip it like this, so you're holding on with the last two fingers of your left hand.}
