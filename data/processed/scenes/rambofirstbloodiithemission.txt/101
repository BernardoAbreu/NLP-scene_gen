<A>__{brewer and rambo, carrying the pow, rejoin co on the ridge, where they had left their gear. rambo sets de fravio down and reaches for his boots. the pow looks dazedly at his rescuers. his eyes, in hollow sockets, track from one to the other.}

<D>__{sorry, i mean... i talk to people all the time... i know a lot of them aren't there. but this is real, isn't it? you're taking me home now?}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{that's right, buddy.}
<A>__{de fravio sits frozen for a moment, then a dry sob wracks his entire body and he puts his arms around brewer. he cries with utter abandon, quietly, while brewer looks at him helplessly.}
