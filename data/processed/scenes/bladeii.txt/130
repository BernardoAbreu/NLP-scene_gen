<L>__{exterior the city dusk}
<A>__{the sun dips towards the horizon. the shadows of the urban landscape lengthen and darken in time lapse.}
<L>__{interior scud's workshop showers dusk}
<A>__{blade stands beneath the showerhead, turning his face up into the scalding spray, rinsing the blood from his chiseled physique. crimson water circles the drain.}
<L>__{interior scud's workshop blade's sleeping area dusk}
<A>__{nyssa now rests on a cot. peaceful, the color having somewhat returned to her features. after a moment, her eyes flutter open and she takes in her surroundings. she is in blade's austere bedroom there are tatami mats, a basin for water, a well thumbed volume of zen koans.}
<B>__{a shaft of sunlight}
<A>__{cuts through an icy window pane above, angling down near nyssa's cot. dust motes swirl about it. nyssa focuses on it. longingly. then she raises her arm and reaches towards it. closer, closer just barely extending her hand into the light. her fingertips blacken and smoke, yet nyssa endures the pain for another moment. finally, she withdraws her hand, inspecting the damage then notices blade watching her from the doorway.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{each day is a little life.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{"each day is a little life. every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death."}
<A>__{she looks back to the sunlight, wistful, sits herself up.}
<C>__{nyssa }
<D>__{anyone else make it?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{blade enters, kneeling by the edge of the cot, inspecting her wounds. studiously avoiding her gaze.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{it would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.}
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{i wouldn't read too much into it.}
<A>__{she reaches for his face. blade stops her hand.}
<C>__{blade }
<D>__{you don't want to go there.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{it doesn't have to be like that. we don't have to be enemies.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{get real. i was useful to damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on. now that it's over, all bets are off.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{if that's true, then why'd you save me?}
<A>__{blade stands now, moving to the ice covered window, troubled by the question. damned if he knows the answer. after a beat, nyssa rises too, keeping to the shadows.}
<C>__{nyssa }
<D>__{why do you hate us so much?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{i am a hunter. a weapon. it's what i do. it's in my blood.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{well it's in mine, too. i'm a pureblood. i wasn't turned. i was born this way. just like you. am i evil because i want to survive?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what about a wolf? what about any predator?}
<A>__{nyssa pursues blade, circling around in front of him so he has to face her again.}
<C>__{nyssa }
<D>__{the only difference between you and me is that i made peace with who i was a long time ago. i'm not ashamed of what i am.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you haven't been hunting us all these years. you've been hunting yourself.}
<A>__{blade moves away. she reaches for his shoulder. he whirls on her, angry, traps her hand. she tires to pull it free but he grips her wrist tightly, pulling her closer }
<C>__{nyssa }
<D>__{you're hurting me.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?}
<A>__{and closer, their faces are just inches apart now }
<C>__{blade }
<D>__{reminds you you're alive?}
<A>__{and blade kisses her, hungrily. nyssa responds in kind. her head drops low, her mouth finding the cords of his neck sucking at his flesh, then sinking her teeth in deep and wham! blade clamps a hand around her throat, slamming her head back. a droplet of blood dribbles from her lips as she lets loose a breathless shudder. she's in the ecstatic throes of the thirst now, all reason gone. blade reaches his other hand to her shirt, ripping it open as he runs his fingers across her breasts, then over her exposed rib cage. he turns her around, forcing her against the wall, sinking his own fangs into the back of her neck. she groans as we }
