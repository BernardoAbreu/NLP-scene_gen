<A>__{kate scans her notes as leopold paces dully about the room.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{in our last session you intimated there was a symmetrical system regulating the social order of conformity spanning your era. i found this particularly intriguing if i can just find it in my notes...}
<A>__{a fire engine races by. leopold dashes to the window then turns back, excited.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{the fire brigade!}
<A>__{kate stares at him blankly. she munches rice cakes and drinks water from the bottle. a beat. she returns to her notes.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{this is insufferable! i refuse to be spied upon, skipped over, or shuffled about any longer. i have yet to venture outside this cell. before i go mad a more suitable arrangement must be found.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{found it.}
<C>__{leopold}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{a resolution?}

<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(infuriated)}
<D>__{thank you!}
<A>__{brushing herself off, she heads to the door.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{dr. coles. i have been acquainted with many women in my time, yet i am compelled to say that the modern woman is by far the least attractive i have ever encountered.}
<C>__{kate}

<A>__{leopold waits.}
