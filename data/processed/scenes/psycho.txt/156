<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{he starts with her toward the path which leads to the old house. camera pans with them, and as they turn around the office corner, they see norman coming down the path toward them. they pause and norman pauses. he does not smile, nor speak. his usual grin and soft friendliness are gone; containment and impassivity lie in their place.}

<D>__{just coming up to ring for you.}
<C>__{norman}

<D>__{we'd hoped to make it straight to san francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky. looks like a bad day coming... doesn't it.}
<A>__{norman walks past sam, giving him the sort of quick, disapproving glance one gives a man who is obviously lying, goes onto the porch and into the office. sam and lila follow norman.}
