<P>__{(great concern)}
<D>__{tell me about peter. what's he been up to? he seems so preoccupied.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{oh, you know peter... he's all caught up in some kind of study he's doing. things are really crazy at the university now. things are crazy... everywhere. i guess peter's just... well, you know... pulled into his shell.}
<C>__{aunt may}
<P>__{(reminiscing)}
<D>__{when peter was little, he loved to hide. in the closets. under the sink. he always needed a secret place. but when i'd look for him, he'd always laugh... he wanted to be found.}

<D>__{yeah... well. i don't think he wants me to find him... well, i'd better be going. my friend flash is picking me up.}
<C>__{aunt may}

<C>__{liz}
<D>__{no... not really... i think you can guess why...}
