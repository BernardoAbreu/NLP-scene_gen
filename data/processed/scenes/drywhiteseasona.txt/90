<D>__{dr. herzog, did you examine the deceased?}
<C>__{dr. herzog}
<D>__{yes, one day captain stolz called me in. the man had toothache.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<P>__{(aggressive)}
<D>__{that's all?}
<C>__{dr. herzog}
<P>__{(uncomfortable)}
<D>__{as far as i could tell yes.}
<C>__{de viliers}
<D>__{you didn't examine him thoroughly?}
<C>__{dr. herzog}
<D>__{why should i? the man was perfectly healthy, just complaining of toothache. i extracted three decayed teeth, and gave him aspirin for the pain... that's all.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{did the captain or anyone else assist you during the examination?}
<C>__{dr. herzog}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{i... i cannot remember.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<P>__{(more aggressive and accusing)}
<D>__{dr. herzog, tell us. have you been intimidated by the security police or did you deliberately cooperate with them in playing their disgusting little game of hide and seek?}
<C>__{louw}
<P>__{(jumping up from his seat)}
<D>__{i protest, your worship.}
<C>__{magistrate}
<D>__{advocate de villiers, will you refrain from insinuations?}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{thank you, doctor herzog... i'm sure gordon ngubene was extremely grateful!}
<A>__{herzog's face is impassive. on crowd reacting.}
<C>__{magistrate}
<D>__{advocate louw?}
<A>__{during the hubbub de villiers and the state advocate trade places. the courtroom is quiet.}
<C>__{louw}
<D>__{thank you, your worship. i'd like to call captain stolz.}
<A>__{there's a buzz from the spectators as captain stolz walks up to the witness stand. he's given a bible. on ben watches him. closeup stolz in witness box, swearing in afrikaans.}
<C>__{louw}
<D>__{you're a police officer stationed at john vorster square?}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{that's right, your worship.}
<C>__{louw}
<D>__{you arrested gordon ngubene. could you describe what happened?}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{acting on information we had received, i went to the house of the deceased, accompanied by lieutenant venter, lieutenant botha, and three native members of the security force. this was about 10 p.m. i informed ngubene that he was under arrest under article 6 of the terrorism act. he then became violent and resisted arrest. a certain force had to be applied to restrain him.}
<A>__{on stanley listening. on ben listening.}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{we found several incriminating documents. these pointed to his involvement with the a.n.c. and activities endangering the security of the state.}
<A>__{on ben looking at stolz, and shaking his head, bewildered.}
<C>__{louw}
<D>__{was the deceased ever assaulted to your knowledge?}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{never. he was always treated with courtesy and correctness. but, one time we had cause to use force against him. it was the day before his death. the deceased suddenly showed signs of aggression. he tried to jump through the open window of my office. he was acting like a mad man. it took six of my men to restrain him, and he had to be manacled hand and foot, for his own safety. but once he calmed down, he was ready to make a statement about his activities. the next morning we found him dead in his cell.}
<C>__{magistrate}
<D>__{is the statement in evidence?}
<C>__{louw}
<D>__{no, your worship. it can't be disclosed in court without damaging our investigation, but i would like to offer into evidence a suicide note written by the deceased.}
<A>__{louw, taking it from his file on the table. stanley and margaret listening.}
<C>__{louw}
<D>__{'dear captain. i prefer to die rather than betray any more of my friends. amandla! gordon ngubene.'}
<A>__{he hands it to the court clerk. there's uproar at this.}
<C>__{louw}
<D>__{thank you, your worship.}
<C>__{magistrate}
<D>__{advocate de villiers?}
<A>__{ben is disgusted. he looks about the court, as if seeking allies. his eyes meet melanie's just for a second there's recognition then he returns to de villiers. advocate de villiers cross examining captain stolz.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{thank you, your worship. captain stolz, you said you treated the deceased always with courtesy and correctness, then how do you account for the injuries found on the body?}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{sometimes detainees deliberately injure themselves for propaganda purposes.}
<A>__{the gallery screams its objections. stanley leans forward and grins across the partition at ben. the magistrate warns the crowd. finally the gallery quiets down.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{you say he tried to jump out of the open window... are there no bars to prevent such an act?}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{they had been removed for repair.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{and why did he wish to jump out? because you were torturing him?}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{he wasn't tortured.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{perhaps it was the toothache then.}
<A>__{no reaction from stolz.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{you said you seized incriminating documents at the deceased's home; can you produce them to see how subversive he was?}
<C>__{louw}
<P>__{(to magistrate)}
<D>__{those documents cannot be introduced as evidence, your worship, in view of the fact that state security is involved.}
<A>__{the magistrate makes a note.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{i put it to you, captain that the only subversive activities the deceased had been involved in were his efforts to establish what happened to his son, jonathan, allegedly shot during a riot, although several witnesses are prepared to testify that he died in detention one month later.}
<C>__{louw}
<P>__{(jumping up)}
<D>__{i protest...}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{this would support my case that an innocent man has died in your hands under highly questionable circumstances.}
<C>__{louw}
<D>__{if it please your worship... this unwarranted slur on the integrity of the special branch is unacceptable... and based, i may say, on allegations which are in any case irrelevant to the present inquest.}
<C>__{magistrate}
<D>__{i agree.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<P>__{(turning on louw)}
<D>__{if the police are really interested in retaining an unsullied reputation, they should not object to the real facts being presented. thank you, captain.}
<C>__{louw}
<D>__{the real facts are being presented as the following affadivits prove. they are all by detainees who testify that they had all seen the deceased intermittently from the time of his detention to the time of his death and on all occasions he was in good health.}
<A>__{as the documents are passed to the magistrate, they are scorned by de villiers. imperviously he requests:}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{i trust the signatories of these ... documents... are available to corroborate their evidence in person.}
<B>__{straight on archibald chigorimbo}
<A>__{detainee in the witness box. he swears in zulu. de villiers holds his signed affidavit.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{mr. archibald, when did you first meet gordon ngubene?}
<C>__{archibald}
<P>__{(looking at black}
<D>__{crowd, then to de}
<P>__{villiers)}
<D>__{i never saw gordon ngubene.}
<A>__{a sudden stillness in the court. on ben. on stanley. on melanie. on louw.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{are you saying that you didn't sign this statement?}
<C>__{archibald}
<D>__{... i never met mr. ngubene... they forced me to sign. captain stolz, he hit me many times with a rubber hose... he said he would kill me 'less i signed... this... this is what he did to me.}
<A>__{he pulls up his shirt his back is covered in bruises. the crowd cannot restrain itself any longer. ben is aghast by what he sees.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{thank you, mr. archibald.}
<C>__{magistrate}
<D>__{advocate louw?}
<C>__{louw}
<P>__{(uncomfortable)}
<D>__{no thank you, your worship.}
<A>__{as archibald leaves the witness stand, held by a special branch officer, he raises his fist in salute and shouts to the crowd: "amandla." the crowd responds: "ngawethu." ben looks at archibald. he is very impressed by this strength in the prisoner's eyes. an officer of the court shouts at the crowd: "silte in die koort" (silence in court) bailiffs collar a few of the loudest protesters and pull them with brutality out of the courtroom.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<P>__{(to town, wearily)}
<D>__{may we put up the second signatory?}
<A>__{louw confers hurriedly with the prosecution officers, then turns back to the court.}
<C>__{louw}
<D>__{your worship the other three signatories cannot appear for reasons of state security.}
<A>__{he sits down, bland, examining his papers.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{your worship, i'd like to recall captain stolz.}
<A>__{as captain stolz returns to the stand he crosses archibald being handcuffed by the s.b. officer. ben watches him passing by the detainee, straight, im passive without a look to him.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{captain, you're still under oath you took archibald's statement. was it voluntary? i'm sure you'll say it was, then how did he come by the injuries on his back?}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{he fell down the stairs a few days ago.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{fell down the stairs. you should do something about those stairs, captain, so many people fall on them. thank you.}
<A>__{the crowd laughs.}
<C>__{stolz}
<P>__{(to the magistrate)}
<D>__{your worship, may i be excused? i have to escort detainee archibal back to john vorster square.}
<C>__{magistrate}
<D>__{you may, captain, and thank you.}
<P>__{(to the crowd)}
<D>__{i think this's a good moment to adjourn we'll reconvene at two thirty.}
