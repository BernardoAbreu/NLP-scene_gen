<L>__{interior other kitchen night}
<A>__{coraline pauses in the doorway.}
<C>__{coraline }
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{be strong, coraline.}
<A>__{she sits at the kitchen table in her regular place, her back to the sink. tall other mother, humming happily, prepares a mushroom omelet and bacon. fragrant cinnamon buns bake in the oven. at the table's center, coraline sees the box with her button eyes with needle and thread. a bead of sweat rolls down her forehead. as casually as she can, she asks:}
<C>__{coraline }
<P>__{(anxious, trying to be cool)}
<D>__{why don't we play ... a game? i know you like them.}
<A>__{the tall other mother's button eyes flash.}
<C>__{tall other mother}
<D>__{everybody likes games.}
<C>__{coraline}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<A>__{bacon sizzles and spits on the stove.}
<C>__{tall other mother}
<D>__{what kind of game would it be?}
<P>__{coraline)}
<D>__{an exploring game ... a finding things game.}
<A>__{other mother tries to act disinterested, but her fingers drum with excitement.}
<C>__{other mother}
<D>__{and what is it you'd be finding, coraline?}
<A>__{coraline hesitates.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{my real parents.}
<C>__{tall other mother}
<P>__{(dismissive)}
<D>__{too easy.}
<A>__{she folds the omelet over in the pan.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{and, and the eyes of the ghost children.}
<A>__{tall other mother smiles: now it's getting interesting.}
<C>__{tall other mother}
<D>__{huh.}
<A>__{the meal ready, she turns from the stove and takes the food to coraline.}
<C>__{tall other mother }
<D>__{what if you don't find them?}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{if i lose, i will stay here with you forever and let you love me.}
<P>__{(indicates button box)}
<D>__{and i will let you sew buttons into my eyes.}
<C>__{tall other mother}
<D>__{hmmm... and if you somehow win this game?}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{then you let me go. you let everyone go my real father and mother, the dead children, everyone you've trapped here.}
<A>__{the tall other mother smiles a malicious not in a million years smile.}
<C>__{tall other mother}
<D>__{deal.}
<A>__{she holds out her hand. coraline doesn't reach.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{not till you give me a clue.}
<A>__{tall other mother snorts, her smile sours. she slowly circles coraline, and speaks as if talking to a very stupid child.}
<C>__{tall other mother}
<D>__{oh, right... in each of three wonders i've made just for you, a ghost's eye is lost in plain sight.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{and for my parents?}
<A>__{tall other mother standing behind her in front of the sink smiles wickedly and just starts tapping her button eye with her finger nail. coraline turns away from her.}
<C>__{coraline }
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{fine. don't tell me...}
<A>__{extending her hand, coraline starts to turn back.}
<C>__{coraline }
<D>__{...it's a deal }
<A>__{but the tall other mother has disappeared and the tapping now is the faucet dripping in the sink. coraline exhales, walks to the sink, stares at the dripping faucet.}
<C>__{coraline }
<D>__{what does she mean "wonders?"}
<A>__{out the kitchen window, the fantastic garden lights up, answering her question. she furrows her brows, thinks this was too easy.}
<C>__{coraline }
<D>__{hmmm.}
