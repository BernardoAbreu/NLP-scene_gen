<L>__{exterior canyon outside the keyhole morning}
<A>__{grug and eep move up the canyon. eep furiously kicks a rock, it nearly hits grug.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{things are tense between the two. at the keyhole, they are met by the rest of the croods.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{eep!}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{mom!}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{grug! what happened!?}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{you know what, i am so mad right now, that i can't talk to her.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{eep?}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{you'll never believe it. i found something new.}
<C>__{croods}
<D>__{new?!!!!}
<A>__{the croods all snatch up stones. they form a defensive circle.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{new's a big problem!}
<A>__{eep is trapped in the middle of the defensive formation. she squeezes out.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{wait. wait!}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{eep. stay inside the family kill circle.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{it wasn't bad.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{new is always bad.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{no. he was nice.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{what!? excuse me? he?}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{oh. well, i thought he was a warthog, but then he turned into a boy.}
<C>__{gran}
<D>__{strange. usually it's the reverse.}
<A>__{grug raises an eyebrow.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{eep's got a boy hog! eep's got a boy hog!}
<A>__{eep elbows thunk in the back of his head.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{there was a boy. watch, okay. i'm gonna call him.}
<A>__{eep pulls out the shell. she blows into the shell the sound alarms the croods. they smack the shell from eep's hand and smash it with their rocks. eep is incredulous. the dust clears the panting croods are satisfied the object is gone.}
<C>__{eep }
<D>__{what is wrong with you?}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{it was dangerous.}
<C>__{eep}
<P>__{(very angry)}
<D>__{it was beautiful. you want to see dangerous? here.}
<A>__{she pelts thunk with a rock.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{owww! my sniffer!}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{okay eep, that's it. we're going back to the cave and you're going to stay in there until you're older than... her!}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{what!? you can't keep me inside forever!}
<A>__{eep throws a tantrum of epic proportion. she slams a rock on the ground. it shatters to dust. creak! a strange groan is heard from under the ground. then a small amount of sand falls from up above. a crack starts to splinter under their feet.}
<C>__{eep }
<D>__{he said this would happen.}
<A>__{then boom! the ground starts to shake!}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{get to the cave! go!}
<A>__{the croods race through the canyon narrows, fighting their way through falling boulders and shifting ground, heading towards the safety of their cave. the croods see the cave entrance. the canyon walls above their home start to crack. grug sees that the falling rock will crush the cave.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{look out! stop!}
<A>__{grug leaps and tackles his family, protecting them from the mass of rocks crashing down. the top of the canyon collapses and the crood's cave is destroyed. everything is engulfed by dust. the earth settles.}
