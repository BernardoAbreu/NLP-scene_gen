<D>__{you guys want a ride back?}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(moving toward the helicopter)}

<A>__{the helicopter takes off, zooms under the bridge, up into a hammerhead and soars back, while cameron continues to scream at it.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{come back here. i'm tired of being your goddamn clown! pay me my thousand bucks!}
<A>__{eli's voice on the helicopter's p.a. speaker echoes through the canyon, as the chopper cavorts overhead and skims away.}
