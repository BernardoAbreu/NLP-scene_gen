<L>__{interior lange's office, homicide day}
<A>__{it is a dank crumbling room. a place where sunlight is not welcome. detective lange, a handsome graying gentleman who's plagued with a chronic case of post nasal drip, sits at his desk. trevor sits across from him. behind trevor is another empty desk. as lange speaks he sniffs wetly every so often.}
<C>__{lange}
<P>__{(to trevor)}
<D>__{thanks for coming down mr. gooding. has your head healed okay by now?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{where's my wife?}
<C>__{lange}
<D>__{okay then. here's the scoop.}
<A>__{lange takes out nasal drops and squeezes some in each nostril as he speaks.}
<D>__{lange (cont'd) (cont'd) we still haven't been able to locate your the body in that river. and missing persons turned up some evidence that qualified the disappearance as foul play.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{what evidence?}
<C>__{lange}
<D>__{for one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{it should all in the report. i told you guys everything. she was giving birth in the fucking car. she grabbed the wheel and i lost control.}
<C>__{lange}
<D>__{i did read that, yes. (flipping through the report) what hospital were you going to? i mean the lodovico street bridge isn't exactly on the way to mercy general.}
<A>__{trevor looks numb, unable to answer. lange poker faced, keeps looking through the reoport.}
<D>__{lange (con't) (cont'd) listen we really are at a stalemate here until we find the body itself. is there any way you did not tell missing persons everything that happened just before that accident?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{why wouldn't i tell you everything?}
<P>__{(impatiently) look, i've been fully}
<D>__{cooperative...}
<P>__{(quick to add)}
<D>__{... to my recollection.}
<C>__{lange}
<D>__{i'm sorry mr. gooding, i meant no disrespect. i'm just doing my job here, ok? i mean between your head injury and the fact that you are on very strong pain medication, you might not be remembering a few details about the crash which might help us here.}
<A>__{lange takes a deep hit of the nasal spray.}
<C>__{lange }
<D>__{what you're recalling could be a fabrication you've made up about it. do you follow?}
<A>__{close on trevor's face as he wrestles with this notion.}
