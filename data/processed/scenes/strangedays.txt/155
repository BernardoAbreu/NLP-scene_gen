<A>__{lenny and mace see helicopters circling as they maneuver the dark streets. xenon searchlights crisscross the rooftops nearby. they see patrol cars passing on cross streets, lights flashing. it feels like the entire lapd is looking for them. everywhere in the street there are small crowds, street parties in progress. people drinking and firing bottle rockets. the police watch everything.}

<D>__{so, let's see, i've got tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the lapd all trying to kill me. happy new year, lenny.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{well, look at the plus side.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{there's a plus side?}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{yeah. you gave up your hot tub tape to save me. that's real progress for you.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{it was a tough call.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{i still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did iris with those two cops.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i don't think those cops did iris. i think whoever iris was wearing for killed her.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{to break the trail. if those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too. our killer is running as scared as we are. which makes him really dangerous. judging by how scared i am.}
<A>__{they pull up to the checkpoint; lenny squirrels into the seat, hiding in the shadows, as mace flashes her security pass and the cop waves them on. lenny lets his breath out slowly.}
