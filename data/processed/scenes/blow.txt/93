<L>__{exterior deserted sugar factory los rios, colombia day}
<A>__{the blazer pulls into a long driveway. they approach a gate where shirtless teenagers with mac 10's stand guard. the gate opens. young soldiers open the door for george and roughly usher him over to a jeep within the confine. they frisk him top to bottom. diego is leaning against another jeep and waits for george to be released.}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{george, good to see you, my brother.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what the fuck is going on? when did you get out of jail?}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{pablo used his influence. now, george, watch what you say. everybody hears everything. a lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't america. life is cheap here, you know? no offense, but you know what i'm saying?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yeah. keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{right. now who is the person in california? the connection?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{just a friend.}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{who? i need to know. ah, never mind. we'll talk about it later.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yeah. you do the talking.}
<A>__{the sound of a young man, a maleton, struggling can be heard in the distance. from another area, pablo escobar emerges. he is singular in purpose. he is handed a pistol and moves quickly over to the man and quietly speaks a few words. and then, without emotion, he shoots the maleton in the head. george and diego, who is visibly shaken, watch. escobar is handed a towel, and he wipes the splattered blood off his hands, as he moves back.}
<C>__{large colombian man}
<D>__{he will see you now.}
<P>__{(to diego)}
<D>__{not you.}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{there must be some kind of mistake.}
<C>__{large colombian man}
<D>__{no mistake. mr. escobar will see mr. jung alone. you are to wait here.}
<A>__{george hesitates.}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{it's alright, george. you go.}
<C>__{large colombian man}
<D>__{this way, please.}
<A>__{the large colombian man escorts george towards the area where the maleton was just shot. george looks back at diego as he is led away.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{so, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{actually, it was three.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{the man who gives us the airplanes. the man from america. the mafia. chicago. boom boom. hollywood. you are going to open for us the gates of hollywood, george?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it would be my pleasure.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{good. very good. welcome, my friend. welcome to my country.}
<A>__{escobar moves over to embrace george. george returns it, and their hands come together. george can't help it. he reflexively looks at his hands. escobar understands.}
<C>__{escobar }
<D>__{the man in the garden. he was full of courage.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{un sapo?}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{un rata no good. but he could have run, fled the country. gone to the policia. but then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{but, never mind. i am thinking we can do much together. this problem with diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business. to release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. the fifty kilos could have been a big problem. and i don't like problems.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{with all respect, padrino. diego is my partner. i do not do business without him.}
<A>__{escobar looks at him with a cold stare. but george doesn't flinch. his face reveals nothing. finally, a smile breaks across pablo's lips.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{i like you, george. you are loyal. that is good. that is rare. maybe crazy. yes. i can tell already. you are like me. i look at you and i see myself. it's in the eyes, no, george?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yes, it is.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{so, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, george?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yes, sir. as much as you can give me.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{as much as i can give you? ha ha. very good. i like that. come, george. let us drive. we have much to talk about.}
<A>__{diego watches the two men walk outside. escobar throws an arm around george's shoulder. pablo hops into a jeep and motions for george. the bodyguards come running. but pablo waves them away.}
