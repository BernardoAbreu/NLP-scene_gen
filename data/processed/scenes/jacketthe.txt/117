<D>__{what about captain medley? he never told them what happened to you over there. his testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i know. it was perfect. [beat] erase my sanity and you erase anything i will ever say. jackie [frustrated] well, doesn't what he did to you make you mad?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{of course it makes me mad. it makes me more than mad. just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. but what's it gonna do for me to find them now? i can't fix everything in three days.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you've got to get yourself out of that place. they're going to kill you if you don't.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i might not be able to.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{it's not a prison, it's a hospital. there's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...}
<A>__{she doesn't finish because it's too hard to. starks nods, wiping her tears and kissing her.}
