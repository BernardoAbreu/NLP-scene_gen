<L>__{exterior second ave day}
<A>__{the evangelist, spotting cole and railly hurrying past him, points urgently at cole.}
<C>__{evangelist}
<D>__{you! you! you're one of us, aren't you?}
<A>__{but cole has stopped and is staring at... a storefront office...its windows covered with posters. the sign over the office says, freedom for animals association.}
<L>__{interior faa store moments later (day)}
<A>__{earnest young activists, fale, deathly pale, ben, long haired, and teddy, muscular, are gathered around a counter collating leaflets that demand an end to specieism. behind them, a large poster proclaims, "animals have souls, too". just then, there's a tremendous clap of thunder as the activists look up and see cole and railly enter. cole looks startled. it sounds like torrential rain pouring in here. maintaining a tight grip on railly's wrist, he looks around frantically for an explanation for the tropical downpour. bookshelves line two walls. the front window is blanked cut with posters of animal rights demonstrations, newspaper clippings, photos of animal atrocities. the fourth wall features the counter where the three activists face cole as a jungle bird screams in the downpour.}
<C>__{fale}
<D>__{uh, can we help you?}
<A>__{cole looks confused as the rain abates and an elephant trumpets an urgent warning.}
<C>__{fale}
<D>__{excuse me. you looking for something in particular?}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{it's all right, james it's just a tape.}
<A>__{cole's eyes follow her look. it's a tape recorder underneath a sign advertising, "the true music of the world".}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i, uh, i'm looking for the, ah, the army of the twelve monkeys.}
<A>__{fale glances at ben and teddy. "we have a problem!" the look says. monkeys start chattering on the tape as teddy comes around the counter, bigger than cole, physically imposing, menacing.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{we don't know anything about any "army of the twelve monkeys", so why don't you and your friend disappear, okay?}
<A>__{cole backs away, a firm grip on railly, as a lion roars.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i just need some information...}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{didn't you hear me? we're not...}
<A>__{teddy breaks off mid sentence...freezes. cole is pointing a pistol at them. a tiger snarls.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{james, no don't hurt them.}
<P>__{(to the activists)}
<D>__{please, i'm a psychiatrist just do whatever he tells you to do. he's... upset disturbed. please he's dangerous just cooperate.}
<A>__{monkeys chatter wildly as teddy backs up.}
<C>__{fale}
<D>__{what do you want money? we only have a few bucks.}
<A>__{cole is suddenly very much in charge and self confident again. a baboon howls with laughter.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i told you what i want.}
<P>__{(snaps at railly)}
<D>__{lock the door!}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{james, why don't we...?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{lock it now!}
<A>__{railly hurries to the door to lock it as ben says to fale,}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i told you that fuckhead mason would get us into something like this.}
<C>__{fale}
<D>__{shut up!}
