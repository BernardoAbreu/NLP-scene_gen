<C>__{annette}
<D>__{how am i a hypocrite?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{oh please annette. you spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. well here it is. right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. i'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. if we were, i'd propose, but that's not going to happen. so i guess we're just fucked. i will move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. and that makes you a hypocrite.}
