<L>__{interior rib joint (somewhere in baltimore) night}
<A>__{malakai, along with snookie and two brain donors, arvel and lip, eat at a booth. patrick strolls in gritty from work. tired from work. he slides in next to malakai. the mood is light, jovial.}
<C>__{arvel}
<D>__{you smell, boy.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{how can a piece of shit tell?}
<A>__{the table cracks up.}
<C>__{malakai}
<D>__{you been scarce lately, man. where you been?}
<C>__{arvel}
<D>__{somewhere dreamin' of a white christmas...}
<C>__{lip}
<D>__{... and christmas ain't even for 'nother six months.}
<C>__{snookie}
<D>__{lip. it's a so to speak thang, you ignorant fuck.}
<C>__{snookie }
<P>__{(looks at patrick)}
<D>__{so. so to speak? whassup.}
<C>__{patrick}
<P>__{(snatching up one of his ribs)}
<D>__{back out my business, boy.}
<C>__{malakai}
<P>__{(watching patrick keenly)}
<D>__{you tappin' that white girl, man?}
<P>__{(half joking)}
<D>__{that's why you ain't got time for your boyz no more, you too busy frontin'. too busy snowflakin'.}
<A>__{patrick lifts one of malakai's ribs, responds coolly.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{how am i frontin', 'kai? i made time for this bullshit, didn't i?}
<C>__{lip}
<D>__{aww, man. you busted. that's why your jaws are gettin' so tight.}
<C>__{snookie}
<D>__{you the one need his jaws tightened with your pork ass instigatin' self.}
<C>__{arvel}
<P>__{(re: patrick's roving fingers)}
<D>__{order somethin', patrick. this ain't no goddamn soup line.}
<A>__{patrick grabs some of arvel's fries, chews them in his face.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{y'all hangin' tonight or what?}
<C>__{malakai}
<D>__{we thinkin' about slidin' through that new rec center opened up on the eastside. you ridin'?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{eastside? that's the wrong side.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{i ain't messin' with those fools over there. you know how they are.}
<C>__{malakai}
<D>__{i ain't pressed. i got my own shit.}
<A>__{shorthand. the table stops. malakai glances around, lifts his shirt to expose a gun. patrick stares at malakai with disbelief.}
<C>__{malakai}
<D>__{what you think? i'ma keep walkin' around waitin' for some chump to cap me? i'ma protect myself.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{that ain't protection. it's an excuse for some unnecessary mayhem.}
<C>__{malakai}
<D>__{ain't nothin' unnecessary 'bout it. shit. mayhem and madness. that's a black man's life.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{how you know? you ain't tried nothing else. now you sittin' up here strapped for no good reason. you askin' for trouble, malakai.}
<P>__{(as malakai laughs)}
<D>__{you think this shit's funny?}
<A>__{snookie shifts uncomfortably. arvel and lip look at malakai. malakai looks at patrick, coldly drops his smile.}
<C>__{malakai}
<D>__{i think it's funny you think it ain't necessary. you act like you don't know where you are no more, patrick, and whassup out there for anybody who ain't you. maybe that's what happens when a white girl goes to your head.}
<C>__{lip}
<D>__{ or gives you some.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{fuck you, lip.}
<P>__{(looks at malakai)}
<D>__{i know what's out there. i also know you can get past it. but that ain't gonna happen, 'kai, long as you keep gettin' in your own way.}
<C>__{arvel}
<P>__{(peacemaker)}
<D>__{aw'ight. y'all said what you had to say. we back to bein' boyz. patrick. chill. have some ribs.}
