<L>__{interior main house rear entrance hallway morning}
<A>__{chance opens the door, shakes off and closes the umbrella before entering. he hangs the umbrella on a doorknob, then heads for the dining room.}
<L>__{interior dining room morning}
<A>__{repeating his ritual, chance enters the dining room, sits, turns on the tv, carefully spreads his napkin on his lap. he watches the screen for a moment, then turns, expecting louise. she doesn't appear, so he turns back, watches tv. after a few beats, chance hears louise's footsteps hurrying down the stairs. she comes into the dining room, visibly distraught. chance looks up, smiles.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{good morning, louise.}
<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(out of breath)}
<D>__{he's dead, chance! the old man's dead!}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(flatly, turns back to tv)}
<D>__{... i see.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{must of happened durin' the night, i don't know... lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. i touched him, just to see, and you believe me, chance that's doin' more than i get paid to do... then i just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{yes. i've seen that done.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{then i got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and i think i woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. he just said, 'yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' lord, what a mornin'!}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(watches news, flashes of season's first snowfall)}
<D>__{... yes, louise, it's snowing in the garden today. have you looked outside and seen the snow? it's very white.}
<A>__{a beat of silence from louise, then anger.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{dammit, boy! is that all you got to say? more gobbledegook?}
<P>__{(chance smiles, is silent)}
<D>__{that old man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you!}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(with a smile, accepting death)}
<D>__{yes, louise. i have seen it often. it happens to old people.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{well, ain't that the truth...}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. it is.}
<A>__{louise throws back the cover from a chair next to chance and sits, softening a bit toward him.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{oh, lord, chance i don't know what i was expectin' from you... i'm sorry for yellin' like i did... no sir, i just don't know what i was expectin' ...}
<P>__{(chance doesn't react, watches tv)}
<D>__{... i 'spose i'd better gather up some breakfast for you...}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(a turn to her)}
<D>__{yes, i'm very hungry.}
<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(rises, looks upstairs)}
<D>__{well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', i guess...}
<P>__{(she starts out, stops by the door)}
<D>__{... what are you goin' to do now, chance?}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(gazing at tv)}
<D>__{i'm going to work in the garden.}
<A>__{louise gives chance a long look, then turns to leave.}
<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(as she goes)}
<D>__{... i will get you some eggs.}
<A>__{chance nods in approval, then changes the channel on the tv.}
