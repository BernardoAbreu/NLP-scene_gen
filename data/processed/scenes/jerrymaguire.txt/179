<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing)}

<D>__{i love you. you complete me.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{aw, shut up. you had me at hello.}
<A>__{he moves to her. they embrace. ray watches in b.g. jerry has given this room hope. it's on their faces. at last, even laurel gets off on her sister's happiness, as she shares a look with chad.}
