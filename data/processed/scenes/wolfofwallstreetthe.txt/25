<L>__{interior investor's center (later that) day (dec '87)}
<A>__{as others brokers bark into phones, jordan sits, phone cradled in his shoulder, making notes. a few beats, then:}
<C>__{jordan}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{mr. fleming, good morning, jordan belfort with investor's center in new york city. you recently responded to one of our ads...}
<A>__{a few of the other brokers glance over, eavesdropping.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{the reason i'm calling is that an extremely exciting investment opportunity crossed my desk today. typically our firm recommends no more than five stocks per year: this is one of them...}
<A>__{a few more brokers look over...}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{aerotyne international is a cutting edge tech firm out of the midwest, awaiting imminent patent approval on a new generation of radar equipment...}
<A>__{later. now all the brokers listen in rapt attention.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{ so if aerotyne's shares rise to only a dollar and our research indicates they could go much, much higher your profit on a mere three thousand dollar investment would be upwards of fifty thousand... that's right, you could pay off your mortgage.}
<A>__{seconds tick by; an eternity, then he starts writing:}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{four thousand dollars, will that be check or money order?... thank you, sir.}
<A>__{jordan hangs up, scrawls out a "buy" ticket.}
<D>__{jordan (v.o.) (cont'd) just like that i made two grand. the other guys looked at me like i'd just discovered fire.}
<A>__{toby welch and the other cave brokers stare at him.}
<C>__{toby welch}
<D>__{how'd you fuckin' do that?}
