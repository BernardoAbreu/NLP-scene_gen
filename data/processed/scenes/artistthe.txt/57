<L>__{interior movie theater "tears of love" screening day}
<D>__{there's hardly anyone in the theater. the people that are there look bored more than anything. at the back smoking a cigarette, george takes the failure on the chin. one couple gets to their feet and leaves the theater. as the man reaches george, he recognizes him and casts him a glance that seems to say "goodness old chap this one's not up to much..." george doesn't know what to say in reply.}
