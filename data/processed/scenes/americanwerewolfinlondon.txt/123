<L>__{interior cinema day}
<A>__{a film (to be determined) plays on screen. the small theater is mostly empty. a few snoring bums and wide eyed children are scattered about. jack sits in the last row in the shadows. he waves to david. david goes and sits next to him.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hi, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hi, david.}
<A>__{they sit for a while watching the screen.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what can i say, jack?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you don't have to say anything.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{aren't you going to say, `i told you so'?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{if i was still alive, i probably would.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you look awful.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(apologizes quickly)}
<D>__{i didn't mean it. i don't know what i'm saying. i'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. i don't remember doing it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what about the zoo?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well, even if i'm not the wolfman, i am crazy enough to do something like that. i mean, here i sit in leicester square talking to a corpse. i'm glad to see you, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i want you to meet some people.}
<A>__{sitting down the row from jack is a man, gerald bringsly, completely in the shadow.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{david kessler, this is gerald bringsly.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. we thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.}
<C>__{bringsly}
<P>__{(in shadow; very english)}
<D>__{yes, i do look most unpleasant.}
<A>__{the camera pans down to show the blood dripping from the seat to a puddle on the floor.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{why are you doing this to me, jack?}
<C>__{bringsly}
<D>__{this isn't mr. goodman's idea. he is your good friend, whereas i am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(appalled)}
<D>__{mr. bringsly, i'm sorry. i have absolutely no idea what to say to you.}
<C>__{bringsly}
<D>__{you've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. and i understand that i am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.}
<A>__{bringlsy leans forward almost into the light, he glistens.}
<C>__{bringsly}
<D>__{you must die, david kessler.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{david, this is harry berman and his fiancee judith browns.}
<A>__{the two victims lean forward from their seats next to mr. bringsly. we can just make out that harry has one arm missing.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{and these gentlemen are alf, ted, and joseph.}
<A>__{the three derelicts sit next to harry and judith. all are slick in the darkness, the light from the screen illuminating their gore.}
<D>__{derelict #2 can't say we're pleased to meet you, mr. kessler.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(defeated)}
<D>__{what shall i do?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{suicide.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(adamantly)}
<D>__{you must take your own life!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{that's easy for you to say you're already dead.}
<C>__{bringsly}
<D>__{no, david. harry and i and everyone you murder are not dead. the undead.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{why are you doing this to me?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{because this must be stopped.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{how shall i do it?}
<C>__{judith}
<D>__{sleeping pills? derelict #1 not sure enough.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i could hang myself.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{if you did it wrong, it would be painful. you'd choke to death. derelict #3 so what? let `im choke.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{do you mind? the man's a friend of mine. derelict #3 well he ain't no friend of mine.}
<C>__{bringsly}
<D>__{gentlemen, please.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{a gun. derelict #1 i know where he can get a gun.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{don't i need a silver bullet or something?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{be serious, would you?}
<A>__{david puts his head in his hands.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{madness. i've gone totally mad.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{a gun is good.}
<C>__{judith}
<D>__{you just put the gun to your forehead and pull the trigger.}
<C>__{bringsly}
<D>__{if you put it in your mouth, then you'd be sure not to miss.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{thank you, you're all so thoughtful.}
<A>__{as the conversation continues, the camera pulls back from the grisly tableau. david grabs his head suddenly.}
