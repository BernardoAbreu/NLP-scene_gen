<A>__{wearing white gloves, fraulein oven opens the case tresckow brought, revealing a portable typewriter. she carefully feeds a sheet of crisp parchment into the machine and sets the margins carefully. pause. then she starts typing with remarkable speed.

<P>__{(handing over papers)}
<D>__{yes, i've been giving that some thought. we should include any field units that are home on leave.}
