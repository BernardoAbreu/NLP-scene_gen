<L>__{interior observation room day}
<A>__{ferris, baines, and wisdom peer down into the white vestibule through a window. technicians operate a control panel.}
<D>__{wisdom aren't you being a little over cautious?}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{not possible with him.}
<A>__{she leans forward, flips a toggle. down below, in the vestibule, a door slides open.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{cris, please step into the next room.}
<B>__{white vestibule}
<A>__{cris gives up on the chains and sullenly steps forward.}
<B>__{white room}
<A>__{size of a squash court. cris enters gingerly and peers around. twenty feet up, an observation window, opaque. on the other walls, rifle barrels poke through narrow slits. the door slides shut behind him. observation room ferris leans forward and speaks.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{cris, we'll be firing at you with live ammo. are you ready? wisdom you're shooting your secret weapon?}
<A>__{ferris signals wisdom to be patient. cris just stands there, flatfooted, arms folded, unafraid. ferris nods. a techie presses a button. the three rifles}
<B>__{fire.}
<A>__{cris is hit square in the chest! by three blue paintballs.}
<D>__{cris you're paying for the shirt. wisdom}
<P>__{(unconvinced)}
<D>__{i hope you've got more than that.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{now we are going to use live ammo.}
<C>__{wisdom}
<D>__{not on my watch, you're not.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{i promise you, he won't be hit.}
<A>__{wisdom looks her in the eye. sees her certainty.}
<C>__{wisdom}
<D>__{it's your experiment.}
<A>__{ferris leans toward a microphone, but before she can speak...}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{"from now on, cris, the bullets are real."}
<A>__{ferris sits back and nods to the techies to proceed.}
<B>__{bare white chamber}
<A>__{cris balances, at the ready, as the three rifles take aim at him. he lunges at the very instant that one rifle fires. a bullet zings by his ear. as the second rifle fires, cris contorts and a bullet parts his hair. as the third rifles fires, he tumbles away, almost a blur. more shots, in rapid sequence, erratic rhythm. two at a time. three at a time. like a pinball, cris pivots, crouches, dodges every bullet. then suddenly stops. stands there. an easy target. click, click, click, the guns are out of bullets.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{he's almost impossible to shoot, hit, surprise, capture, or contain.}
<C>__{wisdom}
<D>__{mind if i try?}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{be my guest.}
<A>__{wisdom takes out his handgun, carefully aims, and discharges six shots at cris doesn't score a hit.}
<D>__{wisdom how do you know it's prevision? maybe he's reading minds.}
<A>__{ferris shows the aiming gantries to wisdom.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{no minds to read. the guns are aimed automatically by infrared. wisdom}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{what other tricks can he do?}
<A>__{ferris pushes a toggle, and a pocket door slides open in a wall.}
<D>__{ferris}
<P>__{(to cris)}
<D>__{please step into the next room.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{i'm going. no need for a hotfoot. baines}
<P>__{(explains, to wisdom)}
<D>__{the floor is electrified. he must have tried resisting and foreseen the result.}
<A>__{cris walks through the doorway into...}
<B>__{the smaller white room}
<A>__{which is familiar from the opening sequence, but not exactly the same. because it's not exactly the same future. a heavy chair, bolted to the floor, faces a plasma screen monitor on the wall. to the left of the screen is a mirror; to the right, a digital clock calendar. ferris' face appears on the monitor.}
<D>__{ferris on monitor cris, it's time to get started with the next test. this won't be unpleasant. we just need to you sit in the chair.}
<A>__{cris eyes the chair with suspicion.}
<D>__{ferris on monitor i want you to look ahead, tell me the time on the clock and then tell me what film clip you see playing. let's start with five minutes from now. then we'll press ahead as far as you're capable of.}
<P>__{(to wisdom)}
<D>__{the clips have been assembled at random by a computer, so nobody knows what'll be playing nexterior}
<A>__{cris looks into the mirror and sees his face reflected as an old man. he turns away.}
<D>__{cris look, i will stand here and tell you what i see.}
