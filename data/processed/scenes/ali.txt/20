<A>__{whopwhopwhopwhopwhop...as first rays of golden light illuminate the jump rope spinning effortlessly over his head in a blur. dust dances in light through the two dirty windows with boxing gloves and "fifth street gym" painted on them. it's that time of day jack johnson called the "fighter's hour," "...between the night and the light..." ...whopwhopwhopwhopwhop... and angelo dundee puts on a pot of coffee. he washes his hands in a dirty sink, thoroughly drying them. alert and clean, he's old school. he goes back to the edge of the ring, reading his newspaper. now, crossing past the white windows is drew "bundini" brown. he takes an orange out of his pocket, sitting on a bench, silently peels it... as cassius "walks" the rope, jumping up and back.}
