<L>__{interior mr. gumb's cellar day}
<A>__{very close on a cocoon, split along its back, as a living death's head moth wriggles torturously free. trembling and damp, the new creature clings to a sprig of nightshade.}
<C>__{dr. lecter }
<D>__{you should try to obtain a list of males rejected from all three gender reassignment centers...}
<B>__{pulling back}
<A>__{we see a big wire cage, holding several of the moths. they crawl over the humus floor or feed at honeycombs, wings pumping lazily. in the distant background, the incongruous sound of show music.}
<C>__{dr. lecter }
<D>__{check first the ones rejected for lying about criminal records...}
<B>__{continuous moving angle}
<A>__{at about knee level, as we leave the cage, and begin to travel through this eerie, dimly lit warren of a cellar. as we go occasionally turning corners, or skirting the dark openings of unexplored passages various objects loom briefly into view, overhead a stainless steel work table... a big sink... jars of chemicals... neat racks of gleaming knives...}
<C>__{dr. lecter }
<D>__{among those who tried to conceal their past, look for severe childhood disturbances, associated with violence... possibly you'll find a childhood incarceration... then go to their personality tests...}
<A>__{we pass a row of female mannequins, some nude, some wearing colorful leather jackets, designer knockoffs, in various stages of completion... then a huge maroon armoire, in chinese lacquer; its double doors are slightly ajar... the jaunty background. music is growing even louder: fats waller singing "bye bye baby." and now we hear something else, too the rapid clicking of a sewing machine...}
<C>__{dr. lecter }
<D>__{study their drawings, especially. billy's house drawings will show no happy future... no baby carriage, out in the yard. no pets, no toys, no flowers, no sun...}
<A>__{we turn another corner, and there is mr. gumb himself. as we approach, his wide back is to us; he's hunched over an old fashioned sewing machine, humming cheerfully, and working a piece of material that we mercifully cannot see. a female wig rests near him on a head form. he wears a hairnet and a beautiful kimono, and pumps the treadle with his bare feet.}
<C>__{dr. lecter }
<D>__{his females will be more crudely sketched than him males but he'll compensate by adding exaggerated adornments... jewelry, big breasts... and his tree drawings oh, his trees will be frightful...}
<A>__{next to mr. gumb is an antique phonograph source of the music. his little dog, precious, perches by his plump ankles. as we pass mr. gumb, precious scurries away from him, panting happily, and we follow the little dog down another corridor, the music starting to fade behind us...}
<C>__{dr. lecter }
<D>__{billy hates his own identity, he always has and he thinks that makes him a transsexual. but his pathology is a thousand times more savage... he wants to be reborn, clarice. he will be reborn...}
<A>__{at the end of this final corridor, the cellar widens into a low ceilinged chamber, with two additional doorways, and in the center of this is the gaping circle of the oubliette. precious sniffs her way over to the edge excited, tail wagging than barks happily as we hear a hoarse, ghostly moan from below.}
