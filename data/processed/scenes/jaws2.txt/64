<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{brody in the tower}
<A>__{still scanning. his body suddenly tenses. there's something out there. he mashes his binoculars to his eyes, trying to get a better look. his point of view (process) through the binoculars, something big and black, moving under the buoys and into the swimming area.}
<B>__{brody again}
<A>__{he can't believe it. but looking past him, we can see it with the unaided eye: a seething dark mass, moving through the water towards the unprotected bathers.}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{out of the water! everyone out of the water!}
<A>__{no one can hear him. a few little faces look up, unable to catch what he's saying. he starts climbing down the ladder shouting.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{get out of the water! tell everyone to get out! now! out of the water!}
<A>__{angle on peterson, vaughn, and nichols reacting.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<P>__{(recalling another panic)}
<D>__{oh, my god...}
<C>__{peterson}
<D>__{what the hell is he doing?}
<C>__{nichols}
<D>__{oh, no!}
<A>__{ellen, mike, and sean looking up, startled at brody's sudden panic.}
<B>__{the water}
<A>__{the dark mass almost on top of the swimmers, who are starting to look around. most of them are oblivious to what's happening on shore.}
<B>__{follow brody}
<A>__{as his feet hit the sand and he starts running for the water, fumbling for his gun and the speed loader with the cyanide bullets. he is bumping into people, knocking little kids over, stepping on blankets and umbrellas, a madman.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{out of the water! now! everyone!}
<B>__{vaughn}
<A>__{running too, half stumbling, half believing, remembering...}
<B>__{ellen}
<A>__{moving after her husband, while mike steadies sean, holding the impulsive kid back.}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(seeing something)}
<D>__{martin! no!}
<B>__{angle on brody again}
<A>__{the gun is out now, he's trying draw a bead on the shape in the water; chest heaving, he tries to steady his shaky grip. people see the gun and scream, throwing themselves flat on the sand, running, some of them going into the water.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{no! don't go in! stay out! stay clear!}
<A>__{he fires. again. bullets ricochet off the water, howling towards the horizon. real panic now. four more shots. reloading, ejected rounds falling bright into the sand, brody on his knees, fumbling with bullets.}
<B>__{angle on a lifeguard}
<A>__{standing on his platform, shocked, watching the chief of police fumbling with his gun.}
<C>__{lifeguard}
<D>__{it's bluefish! it's a school of bluefish! chief! it's bluefish!}
<B>__{angle on the water}
<A>__{it is bluefish a tight mass of them, churning up the water in a dark, dense group. the swimmers look around, confused by the shots and excitement.}
<C>__{a swimmer}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{another swimmer}
<D>__{fish! anyone got a net? 3rd swimmer someone get me a rod and reel!}
<A>__{laughter defuses the tension in the water; bathers move around, some getting closer to see the fish, others leaving the water to join friends and families on the sand.}
<B>__{angle on the beach}
<A>__{where brody is now standing, panting, coming down as a crowd collects at a safe distance around him: ellen emerges from a group that includes vaughn, peterson, and nichols.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{sorry. i'm sorry. false alarm...}
<A>__{curious crowd murmurs as they watch this lunacy. brody realizes he's fired his weapon, that spent shells litter the sand at his feet.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{okay, it's all over, go on, it's over. no trouble...}
<A>__{ellen joins him.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{it's okay. it's over...}
<A>__{brody drops to his knees, fumbling for the cyanide bullets in his gun, trying to put things in order, scrabbling in the sand for the empty shells. the crowd is curious and embarrassed. some turn away, others drift back to their blankets, talking about what's just happened, others stare rudely. brody is coming apart.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{it's all right, everything's all right...}
<A>__{sean emerges from the crowd, and helps his daddy pick up the bullets, ellen moves to disperse the rudely curious.}
<C>__{ellen }
<D>__{let's go, everyone... mrs. bryant, len, please...}
<B>__{close on brody and sean}
<A>__{he sees sean, his eyes fill with tears, and he grabs the kid in a fierce hug.}
