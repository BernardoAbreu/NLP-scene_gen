<L>__{exterior panama (surreal images) day}
<A>__{a most wonderful and surreal image. a heavy mist lies over the forest. we move above it slowly. a figure emerges from the mist. at first only a silhouette then, slowly, a golden figure... an indian, covered in gold... gold artifacts, golden paste on his body. the golden figure turns, and points, into an unknown distance.}
<L>__{exterior treehouse day}
<A>__{from the indian treehouse, columbus, fernando, mendez and several indians are gazing west over a necklace of magnificent lakes. the indians point and talk gently. fernando has never seen anything so fresh, so beautiful.}
