<L>__{interior estelle's kitchen day}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{nick, you little shit, get down here!}
<A>__{jerry hollers from the kitchen where estelle gapes out the window. nick calmly joins them from upstairs.}
<C>__{estelle}
<D>__{nick, do you know anything about this?}
<A>__{she points out the window and they all take in the chevy and the sailors' oh so subtle note on the hood.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{oh, yeah. those sailors came by. they want their money back. i guess there was a banana in the transmission.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{you tell them when i was coming back?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{now why would i do that?}
<A>__{jerry seeths inwardly at nick's mock innocence.}
<C>__{estelle}
<D>__{what are you going to do, jerry?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i think i will go get the lincoln washed.}
<C>__{estelle}
<D>__{you're leaving? what happens when the sailor comes back for his nine hundred dollars?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{just tell him he bought the car with my standard guarantee. thirty days or thirty feet. whichever comes first. i'm in the right.}
<A>__{and on cue comes the ring of the doorbell and the simultaneous pounding of angry navy fists on the back door. they peer out the window and find the fleet on the front steps.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{oh, look. the sailors are here.}
<A>__{jerry first starts to dart one way and then another, searching for a hiding space as he hisses.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{get rid of them!}
<A>__{and then the front door gets kicked open and a mob of sailors pour in. jerry flees. a handheld cam chase as he heads for the back and is cut off by the sailors coming in. jerry bolts up the stairs.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{jerry, where are you going? just tell them you are in the right.}
