<L>__{exterior stream and cornfield. day.}
<A>__{clyde, who has almost reached the other side, comes back and gets her. he drags her out of the water and into a cornfield that starts growing on the opposite bank, c.w. helping. he half carries half runs with her into the cornfield, as the field gets deeper and thicker. they stop for a second.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(panting, to bonnie)}
<D>__{saw...saw a farm...up ahead...gotta get...a car...}
<A>__{he starts to give over the wounded bonnie to c.w.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{baby, no...}
<A>__{but clyde has not heard this last. working on pure adrenaline now, he struggles onward. camera tilts up slightly so we can see clyde as he essays his way toward a farmhouse with a car in the distance. after a few moments he disappears and we can hear only the cracking of the stalks as that sound too diminishes, full shot. cornfield. day. silence. close. c.w. and bonnie. obviously some time later. they both lie prostrate in the field, listening. c.w. licks his lips.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<D>__{maybe }
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{shhh!}
<A>__{they wait for another long moment, picking up only the tiniest sounds.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{oh, no.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{what? what?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(as though it were}
<D>__{the most logical}
<P>__{thing in the world)}
<D>__{i can't die without clyde. i just can't.}
<A>__{c.w. looks at her as if she's gone crazy. after another moment the corn begins to tremble, and we hear the o.s. sound of an approaching car. with c.w. day tentatively lifting his head up to clear the corn stalks. with him we see the car looming larger, bearing down on us, splitting the corn stalks. the car finally comes to a stop a few feet in front of c.w. bonnie is on her feet, and clyde tumbles out of the car, practically before it's stopped, sweeping bonnie into him. for a moment both are in their knees a few feet from the running board of the car, simply holding onto each other and not moving.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(tugging at both of them frantically)}
<D>__{c'mon! c'mon! c'mon!}
