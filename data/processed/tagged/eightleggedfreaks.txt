<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior desert night}
<A>__{a rabbit hops across rough terrain.}
<L>__{exterior highway (desert) night}
<A>__{three trucks from chemical technologies carry barrels of toxic waste. they pass a sign: prosperity, nevada, pop}
<L>__{interior third truck (highway, desert) night}
<A>__{a sleepy trucker called pig pen drives the third truck.}

<C>__{pig pen}
<D>__{i will be self assured and confident around women.}
<L>__{exterior highway (desert) night}
<A>__{the rabbit stops at the edge of the road. the first truck speeds past. then the second. the rabbit crosses the highway in front of the third.}
<L>__{interior third truck (highway, desert) night}
<P>__{self help tape (v.o.)}
<D>__{i will not fear the unexpected.}
<C>__{pig pen}
<D>__{i will not fear the unexpected.}
<A>__{the rabbit appears in the road, frozen by headlights.}
<C>__{pig pen}
<D>__{ahhhhhhhhhh!}
<A>__{pig pen jams on his brakes and swerves to avoid the bunny.}
<L>__{exterior highway (desert) night}
<A>__{the truck slews crazily. missing the bunny by a whisker.}
<L>__{interior third truck (bridge, desert) night}
<A>__{pig pen sees a bridge ahead. if he doesn't regain control, he will crash. at the last second, he gets the rig together.}
<L>__{exterior bridge (desert) third truck night}
<A>__{the rim of a wheel tags the curb. one of those toxic waste barrels falls out of the back and plunges to the water below.}
<L>__{exterior drainage ditch night}
<A>__{a biohazard warning label is legible as the barrel slips beneath the surface. glowing toxic waste seeps from a gash in its side. spreading through the pool like neon ink.}
<L>__{exterior drainage ditch day}
<A>__{the ditch is littered with garbage. the drone of insects. no visible traces of toxic waste. a butterfly net sweeps through the air to capture an oversized horsefly. joshua taft (70s), scrutinizes the bug. this old codger is more comfortable studying bugs than socializing with people.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{hey, mike. check this one out.}
<A>__{mike palmer (12) steps over for a look. puberty hit hard and fast for this bright, little nerd.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{he's huge!}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{they've been like this all week. must be something extra tasty in the water.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{dead coyote. snake maybe. back in the 'nam we'd eat python with a dash of habanero sauce. mighty satisfying.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you ate snake?}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{when you're thirty klicks out from the nearest firebase. humpin' through the wake up with your finger on the trigger. charlie doesn't give you time to stop for cutlet.}
<A>__{as mike skims his own net over the water, he glimpses a familiar barrel at the bottom of the pool. the brightly colored biohazard warning label is clearly visible.}
<L>__{exterior road joshua's house day}
<A>__{two bicycles are parked outside a cabin in the middle of nowhere.}
<L>__{interior joshua's house day}
<A>__{the decor is an odd mix of vietnam era war relics and homegrown scientist. charlie the parrot sits on a perch.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{charlie, don't surf!}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{quiet, bird. we're working.}
<A>__{mike and joshua stand near the spider tanks. a dozen aquariums on low shelves. each glass tank replicates a specific environment: jungle, desert, cavern, pond, etc.}
<C>__{joshua}
<P>__{(dims tank lights)}
<D>__{the sun is going down, my nocturnal hunters. it's time to come out and feed.}
<A>__{mike watches joshua deposit bugs into each spider tank.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{yeah. they're definitely getting bigger.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{i've calculated a growth factor of twelve percent over the last forty eight hours. but that seems to be accelerating.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{all from eating these bugs? maybe i should try some.}
<A>__{mike pauses at the desert tank, watching a cricket search for food. a trap door spider pops out of its camouflaged den like a jack in the box. the arachnid yanks the cricket below and replaces the roof in a nanosecond. mike looks in another tank where ogre eyed spitting spiders shoot blasts of paralyzing goo at hapless insects.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{run, little guys.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{they can't outrun the food chain.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i could get away.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{imagine yourself the size of that fly. a scytodes spitter would be as big as a cadillac. you'd be spider chow, kid.}
<A>__{mike looks in a tank where jumpers chase fleeing crickets. he moves toward another tank that is covered with a towel.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{are the new tarantulas in here?}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{took me forever to get a breeding set of chilean reds. i must have bribed every customs agent from vegas to santiago.}
<A>__{joshua unveils the tank. dirt floor. several burrow entrances. joshua pours in the bugs. a large, male tarantula comes out of a burrow. it pounces on a bug, then wraps its prey in webbing, turning the insect into a mummy like bundle.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{that is too cool.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{male tarantulas compete for the female's attention.}
<C>__{joshua }
<D>__{each one tries to bring her the best present. bugs, rats, even the occasional parrot.}
<B>__{charlie squawks.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{the prey is cocooned alive so she can eat them in her nest. you know how women love breakfast in bed.}
<A>__{joshua leads mike to the back of the tank. a network of subterranean tunnels is revealed. the male tarantulas scuttle through carrying their mummified offerings.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{take a look, the female of the species is three times as big as the male.}
<A>__{mike peers into a large den. the female tarantula steps out of the shadows. this is consuela, the chilean red tarantula.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{say hello to consuela.}
<A>__{mike watches consuela unwrap one of the mummified bundles. she begins to eat the paralyzed insect within.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{she fills her prey with digestive acid to liquify the internal organs. now watch... she'll drink her victim from the inside out. while it's still alive!}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(looks queasy)}
<D>__{and you wonder why my mom doesn't like me hanging out with you.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{arachnids have been roaming the earth for millions of years. and they'll be here long after the human race is dead and buried.}
<A>__{suddenly consuela lunges at the glass. mike recoils.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{bad! bad consuela!}
<A>__{consuela backs up, apparently she can be intimidated. tarantula pov mike the multi eyed spider's panoramic vision. mike looms large at the edge of the glass, wagging his finger.}
<B>__{back to mike}
<A>__{mike stares into the many eyes of consuela.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{do that again and i feed you to the parrot.}
<A>__{charlie squawks hungrily. the sound of a car horn.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{there's your mom.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{see you tomorrow, joshua!}
<A>__{mike heads for the door.}
<L>__{exterior desert day}
<A>__{the entrance to a mine shaft protrudes from a hillside. a pickup truck is parked nearby. the faded logo on the door reads: mccormick and son mining company, prosperity, nv.}
<L>__{interior mine shaft day}
<A>__{rotten beams. chipped walls. a generator powers a string of lightbulbs. a lone figure works at the end of the tunnel. chris mccormick (30s) has rugged good looks. weathered clothing. dirt stained face. ripped muscles. chris chips at the wall with his pickaxe. as it makes contact, the occasional spark flies up. chris pauses to scrutinize the target area with his helmet light. something sneaks along the floor of the mine behind him. chris is oblivious to his unseen stalker. he chips away a section of stone to reveal shiny minerals. reflections of silver and gold splash across his face. his smile fades...}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{damn.}
<A>__{chris bends over, reaching for a bottle of water. a large rat scurries out of hiding dragging away chris's sack lunch. chris grabs his pick axe and goes after the rat. the rodent dodges every hit. sparks fly when the axe strikes rock. these ignite a vent of methane gas. a brief explosion knocks chris off his feet. he notices a small hole in the floor is lit like the burner on a stove. chris pats out the flame as the rat scurries away with lunch.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{hope you like bologna!}
<L>__{exterior highway day}
<A>__{a police car drives with a bicycle hanging out of the trunk.}

<A>__{samantha "sam" palmer (30s) is the sheriff of prosperity and a confident, single mother. mike is seated beside her.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you should see them, mom. each one has a unique feeding behavior. the spitters fire poisonous snot. the tarantulas mummify their prey. the jumpers can...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{why does he have all those things?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{he studies them. nasa uses spider webs in outer space. and for medicine. they've been here forever, and they'll be here long after we're all dead.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you're givin' me nightmares.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{nightmares are cool.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{u.p.s. brought this to the station.}
<A>__{sam hands mike a small package.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{it's from dad! he didn't forget my birthday. i told you he wouldn't.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{better late than never.}

<L>__{exterior desert day}
<A>__{the roar of two off road motorcycles tearing up the desert. bret hale (18) leads the way. a kid rock punk with good looks and fu attitude. seated behind him is ashley palmer (16). this milk fed desert honey is a wannabe britney spears. larry (17) is the wiseacre on the other bike.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{hang on, babydoll!}
<A>__{they gun their bikes onto the highway. slalom the yellow lines. wheelie for days. ashley peeks over bret's shoulder at a police car coming at them in the opposite lane.}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i told you not to act like kamikazes. especially with ashley riding behind. that is unacceptable, bret.}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you just bought yourself a reckless.}

<C>__{harlan }
<D>__{isn't this just your latest get rich quick scheme?}
<A>__{at one end is the prosperity mall. a huge windowless rectangle in the sand. permanent signs tout the many outlet stores inside: victoria's secret, home and garden supplies, sport chalet, etc. hand painted signs reveal: "going out of business sale. everything must go. final close out." on the roof of the mall is a very tall radio antenna.}

<C>__{mike}
<D>__{not until daylight.}
<A>__{the banging on the upper door gets more intense. norman grabs a flashlight and a bunch of battery powered grow lights from his weed farm. he passes them out to the group. chris takes the flashlight and leads the way into the mine shaft. bret is shocked as the others follow him. the group uses the grow lights, and flashlights.}

<D>__{so the female's around here?}
<A>__{bret looks around nervously. the group moves closer. they sine their lights on a horrifying sight. joshua's corpse is a deflated flesh balloon. yellowed teeth sneer from a shattered skull. he's completely desiccated. every ounce of liquid drained away. mike hides his eyes. ashley comforts him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that one just moved!}

<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what's the big deal?}
<A>__{norman steps on the closest one, grinding it under his boot. he stomps around, crushing as many as he can. mike watches this curiously. taking a look at one of the squashed bodies.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i think you should stop.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{they don't have hair. they aren't fully grown tarantulas.}
<A>__{chris and sam look over.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{they're giant babies!}
<A>__{norman freezes. he hears something moving around in the dark. and then a spine chilling... growl. chris reacts to the noise. he can guess what's coming... the female tarantula steps out of the shadows. consuela has grown to be as big as a volkswagen microbus. by far the largest spider we've seen yet. covered in hair. massive eyes. her two fangs are the size of machetes. mike's eyes go wide at the sight of his old nemesis.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{consuela.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{consuela?}
<A>__{the fur on consuela's back seems to undulate. there is something weird there. a lot of weird things. in fact... her entire back is littered with hundreds of baby tarantulas. as consuela advances, she flicks several dart sized quills off her belly right into norman. a dark stain spreads across the drug dealer's shirt.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{bummer...}
<A>__{consuela pierces norman with her fangs, holding him tight. babies flood of her back and onto the doper, chewing him to pieces like ravenous piranhas.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{go!}
<A>__{the group flees toward the opposite end of the cavern. a male tarantula drops down to block their escape. sam blows it away. wade and bret are still chipping away bits of gold.}

<D>__{leave it!}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{so you can keep it all!? hell no!}
<A>__{wade gets a nugget off the wall. he only has a nanosecond to admire it before consuela suddenly looms behind him.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{dad!}
<A>__{bret reaches out toward his father. wade reaches for him. consuela's fangs suddenly protrude from wade's chest and he's hauled backward. the tarantula flings wade into the cave.}

<D>__{bret, come on!}
<A>__{bret runs after the others. but he sees consuela firing more quills at the group. directly at ashley. bret leaps into harm's way. he's turned into a pin cushion.}

<A>__{chris looks at gladys.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{i blew up the kitchen.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{keep going up the tunnel. there should be a generator at the exit. start it up and await for my signal to throw the switch.}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what about you?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i need to set the fuse as close to the spiders as i can. that should give us time to get clear.}

<D>__{hurry!}
<A>__{sam lifts the motorcycle upright and climbs on. she starts it and revs the engine. ashley leaps aboard. sam accelerates along the shaft, away from the spider. the bike's headlight illuminates their path. the male tarantula scurries after the bike. sam rides the motorcycle along the shaft. ashley hangs on tight. they've put some distance between themselves and the male tarantula. a dead end looms before them. ashley screams as her mom stops on a dime and does a 180. sam rides back the way they came, heading straight toward the male tarantula. ashley looks over her mother's shoulder at the giant spider coming in the opposite direction.}

<D>__{oh shit.}
