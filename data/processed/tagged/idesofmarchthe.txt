<A>__{a pause. stephen snaps his fingers in the mic. we hear the distinct sound of feedback getting louder until it stops. we hear the director speak over the loud speaker.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{hang on...let me open these up....}
<A>__{we wait as stephen looks around. he looks at stage hands who are busy working. no one pays any attention to him as he stands there. this isn't awkward for stephen, this is}

<D>__{you got it.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{also we'll need these podiums put on a riser as we agreed to in the pre conditions. you're a few inches short and it makes it harder for the governor to read his notes.}

<D>__{and i think we will, but i won't tell you it's a sure thing. fucking saint gabriel can blow his horn on election day and get his four horseman to rig the ballot boxes for pullman and it wouldn't surprise me. don't get me wrong. six presidentials i've done and i've never felt this good. but am i gonna sit here and say "yes we will definitely win ohio"? not a chance. in the last thirty years seventy three democrats have run for president. how many have won? three.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{that means seventy guys ran who thought they had a chance, and they all lost.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{so you're saying there's a good chance you won't win.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{don't twist my words. what i'm saying is that i'm not going to promise we'll win. but he's decorated by bush senior from the first gulf war and protested the second. he left his state with a balanced budget and the fourth highest education rate. the republicans have nobody out there that can touch this guy...so for this moment, this election, this primary is the presidential. and that ida, is the state of the union. and on that note, i'm gonna take a shit.}

<C>__{stephen}
