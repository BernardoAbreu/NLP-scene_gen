<L>__{interior james's flat london night}
<A>__{james is on the phone to his brother peter, while playing scale electrix cars on a track alone, barefoot...}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{i need a drive, pete. need you to find me a drive.}
<P>__{(listens)}
<D>__{what does that mean? "my reputation precedes me?"}
<A>__{"crash", the electric toy car crashes...}
<C>__{james}
<P>__{(listens)}
<D>__{really? is that what they said?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{did they at least say a "quick arsehole?"}
<P>__{(listens)}
<D>__{bollocks to lotus. find me someone else. i will go mad otherwise.}
<A>__{"click", james hangs up. suzy walks in. sees his mood..}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{don't worry. something will turn up.}
<A>__{james opens a bottle of scotch, pours himself a drink...}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{but i doubt that will help in the meantime.}
<A>__{james knocks back the drink...}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{why don't we go away for the week end? before i leave again for new york?}
<A>__{james carries on drinking..}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{talk to me, james. don't make a stranger of me.}
<A>__{james doesn't react...}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{i can't watch this.}
<A>__{suzy picks up her coat, and bag..}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{what were you hoping for? a well adjusted knight in shining armour?}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{no danger of that....}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{let me give you some advice.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{i'm all ears...}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{don't go to men who are willing to kill themselves driving in circles looking for normality.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{well, i certainly didn't get that...}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{should have gone for one of my brothers.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{there goes that self pity again. how striking it is }
<C>__{james}
<D>__{what's that? tell me..}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{the gulf between appearance and reality. look at you, all sunshine blonde beauty and smiles...yet the reality is...a frightened, immature, depressed, self pitying child...}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{at least there's something behind the facade.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{with a nasty temper..}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{fuck off to new york, dear. there must be a moisturizer or eye shadow somewhere that needs your vapid mush to flog it.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{how quickly beauty can turn ugly.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{agreed. repellent.}
<A>__{suzy stares...and goes. james carries on drinking.}
