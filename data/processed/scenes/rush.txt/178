<A>__{james's spray makes it impossible for niki to see. niki can't blink his eyes...it's agony. half blind, niki tries to overtake. gives it everything he's got, breaking as late as he can, tearing through the gears... for niki the world flies past in a near blind blur. the steering wheel shakes. the car cannot be driven any harder. but the visibility is terrible. the spray tears into his scarred eyes. he is unable to see anything but... marlene's beautiful face: staring at him. smiling tenderly. kissing him tenderly.}
