<L>__{interior sera's house day}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{ben?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{he shakes his head.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i was miles away.}
<A>__{he sees the parcels.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{ah... more gifts. i have to sit down for this.}
<A>__{he strides into the living room and flops on to the sofa. she follows.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{sera, i love that name... s.e.r.a. before we proceed onwards, there is something i need to say. ok?}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{ok.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i've come this far... here i am, in your house. i want you to let me pay the rent for this month. all right?}
<A>__{and he stares at her as if to say that nothing can happen until this matter is resolved.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{because... it's better for me that way. ok?}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{well... ok...}
<A>__{she is uncomfortable. they sit in silence for a while.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{sera... i hope that you understand how i feel about this. first of all, you're welcome to my money. we can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. but i don't think you're talking to me right now about money.}
<C>__{sera}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no. i think you're talking about you. i will tell you right now that i'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, i'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{i know that...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{... and i'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. we know i'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. and i know that you're a hooker. i hope you understand that i'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that i'm indifferent or that i don't care... i do... it simply means that i trust and accept your judgement. what i'm saying is... that i hope you understand that i understand.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{thanks, i do understand. i was worried about how that would be... but now i'm not. and you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{ah, yes... i suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{whatever that means. open your presents.}
<A>__{she hands him the larger of the two parcels.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{open this one first.}
<A>__{ben awkwardly unwraps the present, a large, colorful shirt. a genuine smile comes on to his face.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{very nice.}
<A>__{he holds the shirt against himself.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{this should work very nicely with my suit, which, by the way, is the only item of clothing i brought over from the motel with me.}
<A>__{sera raise an eyebrow.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{right... the suitcase was clinking. so what did you do with your clothes?}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{i threw them into the garbage., which was perhaps immoral, but i wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. i thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.}
<C>__{sera}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{nice talk, ben. keep drinking. in between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth.}
<A>__{she hands him the last present.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{now, try this one.}
<A>__{ben unwraps the smallest gift. it is a silver hip flask. he is very touched and a little tear trickles down his cheek.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well... looks like i'm with the right girl.}
<A>__{he turns it in his hands.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i must say that i'm very impressed that you would buy this for me. i know you wouldn't do this without thinking about it. funny... you did just what i would have done.}
<A>__{ben stands and tries the flask in his pocket for fit. it is fine. he walks to the door.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm going to fill it right now.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{do you want to go gambling tonight? we could go out and play for a few hours.}
<A>__{ben comes back into the room, takes the flask out of his suit pocket and has a drink.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i hadn't planned to gamble... but if you would keep the bulk of my money here, then i could safely blow a couple of hundred bucks.}
<A>__{he takes out all of his money, peels off a few hundreds and then gives her the rest.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{giving you money makes me want to come.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{then come.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i'm going to change. watch tv. i will be half an hour.}
<A>__{and she leaves. there is a slight edge to her voice and ben is not sure if he offended her or not. he watches through the small angle of the door as she changes.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{i am planning to go out and do some work.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{tomorrow night as a matter of fact.}
