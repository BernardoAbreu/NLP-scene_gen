<B>__{city street}
<A>__{heavy vehicle and pedestrian traffic. cates stands near a hot dog stand. elaine joins him. cates is eating a hot dog and studying a police file.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{great place for lunch.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{yeah, one of my favorites.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{you made the front page.}
<A>__{he hands her a dog.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{yeah, guess it must have been a slow news day...}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{jack, are you okay?}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{sure, okay, fine, no problem... see, there's this kid in jail ... first thing i got to do is go up and see what he knows ...}
<A>__{he points to the file.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i thought you might come over to my place to recuperate. i don't have to go to work until the day after tomorrow.}
<A>__{they begin to stroll down the street.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i got nothing to recuperate from. there's a guy out there with my gun, and i want it back.}
<A>__{she's not happy with this attitude.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{bullshit? i will tell you about bullshit. my gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it. it isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{look, jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop. it's not a practical way to function...}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i didn't get burned, two cops did. listen, i will tell you about personnel responsibility. i like to get the job done right. and if i don't get my job done right... i'm for shit.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{here it comes again ... the sacred job...}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{that's right. i'm not like you. i'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... there's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and i'm gonna get him. because it's my job. and if you don't get that...}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i get that. the job first. everything else, especially me, second. i get it. i don't like it.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{no one asked you to like it... but that's the way it is.}
