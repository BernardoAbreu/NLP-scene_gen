<L>__{1,000 black dots conspiring to form the same exact shape that}
<A>__{o'ryan had painted onto the wall of his room a massive wave of darkness, gathering strength. but this black wave is consuming america... mackelway stares at it: awed, even a bit frightened. the thing seems vast, unstoppable... a black wave pure malevolence, covering the states like a fog. one blue dot lies in its center: that blue pin, in the heart of greenville, texas. then, piercing the silence:}
<C>__{charlton }
<D>__{got one of those pins in denton yet?}
<A>__{mackelway turns. charlton leans in the doorway.}
<C>__{charlton }
<D>__{o'ryan was spotted there tonight. took a squad car and a side arm from a state trooper. 'bout an hour later a five year old boy was abducted, roughly a mile up the interstate.}
<A>__{it's 3 a.m. what's this guy doing here?}
<C>__{charlton }
<D>__{the vehicle was found in an abandoned lot. we're establishing a perimeter around the city now.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<P>__{(knows already)}
<D>__{but the trooper wasn't hurt...}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{what makes you so sure?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{professional courtesy.}
<A>__{charlton's at a loss... until mackelway gestures to the table, where he has laid out o'ryan's entire fbi file. every memo, citation, letter, i.d. picture. 150 pages. charlton eyes it, calmly. he's not going to let his jaw drop, not with mackelway watching. so he just nods.}
<C>__{mackelway }
<D>__{is that... possible, sir? an agent can just be deleted?}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{looks like it.}
<A>__{mackelway pauses. it's a depressing reality...}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{i couldn't understand it before pushing speck's car onto the state line. makes sense now. he wanted to make the case federal. he's drawing us in.}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{why would he do that?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{so we'd be paying attention when he found suspect zero.}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{ya know what? i'm getting extremely tired of hearing that word. in fact, that's gonna be policy from now on. no zero.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{sir, profile the guy. he's straight outta quantico. all he's doing is working a case, like we would. he's not kidnapping little kids he's chasing the guy who's doing the kidnapping! look at the map!}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{what're you saying that all these abductions are the work of one guy? do you know how fucking insane that is?!}
<P>__{(over mackelway)}
<D>__{not let's try something that actually makes sense: he sends in these faxes, picks off three scumbags. for what?! so we'll think exactly what you're thinking right now that we've got a friend out there, somebody willing to take out the garbage for the rest of us. and it's all horse shit!}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{what if it isn't? what if there really is a zero out there and o'ryan's the one guy who's got a shot at him?}
<C>__{charlton}
<P>__{(just blew his top)}
<D>__{fuck's sake, mackelway when did you start buying into this guy?!}
<A>__{a beat. mackelway lets the silence hover.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{he's smarter than we are.}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{speak for yourself.}
<A>__{charlton heads for the door.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{sir? what if i told you i knew how to catch him?}
<A>__{charlton stops. turns.}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{and what if i told you that the way i'd catch him involved sitting in a dark room, with nothing in front of me but a pad of paper... until i'd tapped into some kind of... energy out there. the collective unconscious. something. if i told you i thought i could target and}
<C>__{mackelway }
<D>__{locate him, without ever leaving this building, what would you say?}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{i'd say you'd watched too many "x files."}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{y'ever heard of a project called "icarus," sir?}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{mackelway tosses over a few pages from o'ryan's file.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{agents, trained to "see" distant locations using nothing but the mind. they called it remote viewing.}
<A>__{charlton eyes the pages without comment.}
<C>__{mackelway }
<D>__{army stole it from the soviets. the bureau stole it from the army used it to track serial killers.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{experimental program. o'ryan was the first agent they recruited.}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{good for him.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{voodoo, right? pure bullshit.}
<P>__{(charlton's waiting)}
<D>__{...except, it worked. it's how he drew this:}
<A>__{mackelway's referring to that drawing: a steamer trunk, filled with ghastly ziploc bags:}
<C>__{mackelway }
<D>__{he'd never been in that house before. he just saw what was in there the bureau taught him how... same one that deleted him. same one that's trying to catch him now... does anything about all this strike you as odd?}
<A>__{charlton studies him, a long beat, measuring him... then:}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{i'm going to denton at oh six hundred. you can take the day off.}
<A>__{with that, he's gone leaving mackelway alone in here. nothing to look at but that black wave... he hears charlton, leaving the building. he slams another vicoden, then hears a phone ring. fuck it. he's not moving. let voice mail get it. ...until he hears the sound of a fax coming in. he rises. follow him:}
