<A>__{with a red pen, he begins absently drawing red circles around any v he sees on any piece of paper. victims. vectors. values. victory. words from quotes and lists. suddenly, he stops. carefully, as if reaching to touch a butterfly, he slips a single sheet out from the sheaves covering his desk. the paper has a long list: the names of all the queens of england. he has circled in red the v in victoria. when it hits him, it hits him like a falling safe.}
