<L>__{exterior cemetary night}
<A>__{charlie and johnny boy are sneaking over a fence in an old cemetary which is part of their neighborhood. it surrounds their church and dates back to the beginning of the 19th century. no one is buried there any longer. it is very quiet and dark. they sit and rest. charlie is still in his makeup.}
<C>__{johnny boy}
<D>__{i swear to god charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why i didn't go to work. i swear it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{that's not going to help.}
<C>__{johnny boy}
<D>__{i'm going to work this week...i mean it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?}
<C>__{johnny boy}
<D>__{i'm sorry charlie...i didn't mean it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{big deal...in the meantime, it's done...i will still try to help you out...you know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?}
<C>__{johnny boy}
<D>__{charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{johnny boy}
<P>__{(coaxing)}
<D>__{if you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that'll help you out fine. that's the best way for you, not for me! i swear to god, i will rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this. you understand? i don't care what happens, he doesn't find out.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{i don't get involved with anything, you understand that? nothing! i'm clean as far as you know...right?}
<C>__{johnny boy}
<D>__{yeah, take it easy. will you relax.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that's what i get for getting involved. look, on pay day at least show up at tony's place to meet him, ok? this way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him. if you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand? i'm not asking i'm telling you!!}
<C>__{johnny boy}
<D>__{i understand.}
<A>__{johnny boy closes his eyes. charlie looks at johnny boy and then looks at the cemetary in the moonlight. it seems totally apart from the city with the sirens and cars far in the distance. charlie stands and unravels his robes, preparing to take them off. he projects the image of christ delivering a sermon. music and laughter in the distance catches his attention. the lights and the music are coming from the top floor of a tenement building where a puerto rican family is having a party. the sound echoes through the streets. decorations are hanging and blowing away through the open windows. as charlie watches a fight break out over one of the girls. screams are heard. people run up and down the fire escape. charlie has pulled off the robe. he now removes the beard and wig and has become himself again. he leans over to find johnny boy fast asleep on a tomb.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{'could you not, then, watch one hour with me?'}
<A>__{he wakes johnny boy up.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{'the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.'}
<A>__{they leave.}
