<L>__{interior olive's bedroom present day}
<A>__{into the webcam }
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{the next day, things took a turn for the scandalous. which brings us to part three: a lady's choice and a gentleman's agreement.}
<A>__{she smiles slyly into her camera.}
<L>__{interior room 704 day}
<A>__{bored, olive sits at a desk in a classroom, reading a tattered copy of `the scarlet letter.' she's dressed much racier and is starting to look pretty hot. there's only one other person in the room. the bullied kid seen by olive leaving gibbons's office the day before. the bullied kid is thin as a rail, pale as a ghost and slightly effeminate. he looks miserable. not just by this detention, but from life in general.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{are these detention sessions often unchaperoned?}
<C>__{bullied kid}
<D>__{i don't think we pose a flight risk.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i see.}
<A>__{olive laughs to herself.}
<C>__{bullied kid}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i was just thinking it's kind of funny. we haven't really talked since that closet incident back in eighth grade.}
<C>__{bullied kid}
<D>__{i was afraid you were going to bring that up.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{so, how have you been, brandon?}
<C>__{brandon}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{i have been fantastic.}
<C>__{brandon }
<D>__{really, really amazing. don't know if you heard, but according to my locker, i'm a `power bottom.'}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{yikes.}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{yeah, only two days after the custodians had finally gotten around to scrubbing `turd burglar' off. which, if you think about it, really contradicts the previous label.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{maybe your vandal is marvelling at your versatility?}
<A>__{brandon shoots her a `that's not funny' look.}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{but, of course, i'm in detention.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{because gibbons is a homophobe.}
<P>__{(beat.)}
<D>__{and i called him a facist.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{so, the rumors are true, huh?}
<C>__{brandon}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{have you ever met me?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{no. i meant about gibbons being a facist.}
<A>__{he laughs.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{i kind of guessed it that night with the whole kissing thing. the way you ran away. i remember thinking to myself, `this isn't the first time this kid's going to go bursting out of the closet.'}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{gold star for you, nancy drew.}
<A>__{there's a brief silence between them.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{you know, i read this article that said with this whole emo movement, it looks like that in a few years the gay kids are going to be the most popular ones in school.}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{oh good. i will come back when i'm twenty seven for my redo.}
<A>__{ignoring his cynicism }
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{can you imagine the dance squad full of shirtless guys in tight pants rocking out to britney, while the football players sit on the sidelines wishing they were that cool?}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{that'll be the day.}
<P>__{(beat.)}
<D>__{judging from the new look you're sporting, i'm not the only one in a transformative stage. `sup with the whore couture?}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{haven't you heard? i'm the new school slut!}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{as a matter of fact i did hear that. i heard you banged a guy twice your age.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{no way. he's a freshman in college.}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{also heard he gave you crabs.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{ewwww. people suck.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{tell me about it.}
<C>__{olive}
<A>__{he's not real. the guy i slept with. i made him up.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{so, you started the rumor?}
<C>__{olive}
<A>__{indirectly? sort of. well, not really. no. no, i didn't.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{but you're perpetuating it. that's fucked up.}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(offended)}
<A>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{it's true. there's only one thing worse than these tabloid chasing celebutantes with their vapid minds and their immoral souls and that's the people who want to be like them.}
<C>__{olive}
<A>__{did i say i wanted to be like them?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{no, you just want everyone else to think you are.}
<C>__{olive}
<A>__{why does it matter if it's not who i really am? no offense, brando, but maybe you could learn something from me.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{you're saying i should pretend to be straight, so people will like me? what a novel idea. you should do seminars. oh, wait a minute, i forgot... in high school,}
<B>__{everybody pretends to be something}
<A>__{they're not!}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{calm down, adolph. there's a vein popping out of your neck. i'm simply suggesting that maybe these kids we call peers have got the right idea. maybe bridget schumacher isn't as hippy dippy as she pretends to be. maybe that's just the label she's put on herself to avoid having to bathe as often as society deems necessary. or take marianne bryant. it's convenient for her to act like a stuck up jesus freak.}
<P>__{(thinking about this)}
<D>__{no. i'm wrong. i think she's actually just a stuck up jesus freak. but do you think she cares that that's the way she's perceived? no. maybe she was just sick of being just another nameless, faceless entity in a place and a time that reveres people for extremity?}
<A>__{brandon realizes why she's chosen this path and feels for her.}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{there are some of us, though, that want to just blend in to the crowd.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{then maybe you need to go to that extreme. or make the steadfast decision not to care. even better if you can manage to do both.}
<P>__{(beat.)}
<D>__{i've discovered an infallible remedy for teen angst: apathy.}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{i can't decide if you're a genius or a lunatic.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{don't they sort of go hand in hand?}
<A>__{she smiles sinisterly at him.}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{funny. i always thought teen angst and apathy went hand in hand.}
<A>__{there is an electricity in the air and it seems as if at any moment, they might fling off their clothes and screw right there.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{how am i doing?}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{what? pretending to be a whore? for a virgin, i'm impressed. how about me? could i pass as straight?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{not bad. for a fag.}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{i prefer the term `turd burglar.'}
<A>__{they both break character and return to being themselves.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{if we really wanted to shock the world, we'd get up and leave detention.}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{but you know that we would never do that.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{isn't going to stop me from telling everybody we did.}
<A>__{brandon thinks hard about everything that's just been said. his brain is going a mile a minute. in that noggin, an idea has been planted. olive, not oblivious to this, returns to her novel.}
