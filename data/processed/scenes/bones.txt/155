<A>__{bones has jeremiah on his feet now, leading him towards the wall of the undead. suddenly, hands shoot out of the wall, only inches away from jeremiah's face! he twists and turns to stay away from them, but the long nails on one of the hands claw at his cheek. while hungry mouths open from the palms of hands.}
