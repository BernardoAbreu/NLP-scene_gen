<L>__{interior casino craps tables night}
<A>__{as shelly and the group pass a hot craps table, nicky is drawn to it.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{wait up a second...}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{i thought we were gonna eat?}
<A>__{only now do we see bernie has arrived to cool the table of its hot shooter a loud, pudgy, overdressed suburbanite. shelly eyes bernie.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{maybe we wanna play over there. less crowded.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{nah, let's play here. this is my lucky table. i always play here.}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{go on ahead. i know where to find you guys.}
<A>__{shelly signals bernie to back off. bernie steps back. shelly, larry and marty head for the restaurant. nicky quickly slaps down some green. the stickman slides the dice over to the suburbanite who is shooting. he scuttles the dice. they bounce up over the rail and spike nicky on the forehead before dropping back on the felt. the players chuckle.}
<C>__{stickman}
<D>__{out! seven, line away seven...}
<A>__{nicky rubs his forehead, glares at the suburbanite. he fires back.}
<C>__{suburbanite}
<D>__{c"mon, pops! what the hell? i coulda paid my mortgage with the money i just lost.}
<A>__{nicky says nothing. the table is quickly cleared by the dealers. the stickman skips the next shooter and feeds the dice to nicky.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{hey? i'm supposed to be nexterior..}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{file a grievance, shithead.}
<A>__{suburbanite is still fuming over his loss. nicky places a couple hundred on the passline.}
<C>__{stickman}
<D>__{we're coming out. crap eleven, any seven.}
<A>__{nicky throws in some chips to the center.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{hundred dollar big red.}
<A>__{suburbanite watches as nicky runs through a lengthy pre shot routine. lots of hand jive and cuff shooting.}
<C>__{suburbanite}
<D>__{hurry it up, gramps. your soup's getting cold.}
<A>__{nicky throws.}
<C>__{stickman}
<D>__{crap, ace deuce. line down.}
<A>__{the croupiers takes down the pass line.}
<C>__{suburbanite}
<D>__{hey, busketti, maybe you should try shuffleboard.}
<A>__{nicky is fed the dice again. same routine. nicky just fires an incendiary look back at the suburbanite.}
<C>__{suburbanite}
<D>__{uncle palsy? shake'em this direction.}
<A>__{nicky throws.}
<C>__{stickman}
<D>__{four, hard four. the point is four.}
<A>__{the players make their bets.}
<C>__{suburbanite}
<D>__{good now throw it before you fucking keel over and die, old man.}
<A>__{nicky slowly starts his routine defiantly.}
<C>__{suburbanite}
<D>__{happy birthday to me. happy birthday to me... jesus, fuck, i'm another year older already.}
<A>__{nicky throws.}
<C>__{stickman}
<D>__{out! seven! line away.}
<A>__{nicky claps his hands dealer style for effect and with a gentlemanly smile steps back from the table. nicky's chips are quickly swept up by the croupier.}
<C>__{suburbanite}
<D>__{don't take it so hard, pops. everybody craps out.}
<A>__{nicky locks eyes with the suburbanite. then flashes a smile that suggests he's going to brush it off. he turns away from the table...}
<C>__{suburbanite}
<D>__{now go change your fucking depends.}
<A>__{nicky makes like it's all in good jest. yeah, that's real cute. he heads around the table to the suburbanite, holds out his hand as if to say: hey, no hard feelings. the suburbanite shrugs. what the fuck? i was just playing with you, pops. he reaches for nicky's hand... when nicky suddenly headbutts him. before anyone can react, nicky starts laying into the suburbanite. the man goes down and. nicky continues pummeling him...}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{who's laughing now, huh? ya fuckin! prick! c'mon, crack wise again... ya fuckin' smooth as a ken doll, no dick, suburbanite scum. how's that for a game?!}
<A>__{shelly alerted to the fracas, rushes back to the table. he takes immediate control of the situation. snaps his fingers at security. the suburbanite is whisked away with a pocketful of comps and a bruised ego. shelly takes nicky aside, attempts to calm him. nicky keeps railing at shelly:}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{that ain't right, shelly! guy fucks up my game like that. who the fuck does he think he is?}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{you're right. he's just a piece of shit. forget about him.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i thought this joint had more class. used to be, we wouldn't even let bums like that in...}
<A>__{nicky catches himself. he looks at shelly for a beat. there's an unspoken understanding between them. "the good old days." we see bernie in the b.g., looking more than a bit shocked.}
