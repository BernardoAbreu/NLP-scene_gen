<L>__{exterior harbor day}
<A>__{later in the day, sailboats with bright colored sails and ornately painted hulls tack back and forth. lots of chatter between boats, horseplay, splashing, and general good times. it's cruising, on water.}
<L>__{exterior harbor, aboard mike's boat day}
<A>__{with mike, andy, jackie and brooke.}

<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{real fast.}
<A>__{he sheets in, heeling the boat over in the stiff breeze.}
<C>__{brooke}
<D>__{far out!}
<A>__{jackie screams in excitement; for a city girl, this is more fun than a roller coaster. angle on a red catamaran, "sizzler" overtaking mike's boat. it's piloted by larry vaughn, jr., the mayor's son; with him is his good friend, bob burnside.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{coming up!}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{gangway, turkies!}
<A>__{it's immediately a race between the red boat "sizzler," and mike's "green machine." the kids ad lib "faster," "lookout," "gybe, gybe."}

<D>__{we're carrying weight.}
<C>__{larry}

<A>__{denise hops nimbly from one boat to the other as danny sails tight as a tick to the red cat.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{way to go!}
<A>__{quick cuts: fun at sea the sailboats cutting up, cruising the harbor, the local teen agers partying with each other: patrick and lucy's sol cat, flying its hull. susie's laser heeled 'way over' in a stiff breeze. polo and a pretty girl in his sloop, "sea witch." timmy weldon and doug fetterman playing catch up in their respective boats, the doughdish and the inflatable. marge in her lightening, sailing close to ed and tina in tina's joy.}
