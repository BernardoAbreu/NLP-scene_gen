<DIAL>__{MARFA, TEXAS, 1993.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{CREDITS BEGIN.}
<ACTION>__{A plume of dust comes into frame.  The dust is from a TRUCK, orange and white and violet, with "FedEx" blazoned across the side. The truck turns into a collection of ramshackle World War II era Quonset huts and outbuildings.  Around the outbuildings are large sculptures of wood and metal.}
<LOC>__{EXT.  QUONSET HUT - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The door is opened by a WOMAN in her late twenties.  Hair pulled back, casual, an artist.  She hands the DRIVER a FedEx BOX which is decorated with a drawing of two ANGEL WINGS. The Driver has a hand-held computer; a portable printer dangles from his belt. The Driver scans the package with his hand-held computer, prints out a label and sticks it on the Box, ready to go. But something on the box catches her eye.  She wants it back. He glances at his watch.  She draws RINGS around the Wings, uniting them.  She gives the box to the Driver, then hands him a cup of coffee.  They've done this before. He takes a sip of the coffee, then runs for the truck.  He jumps in and heads back onto the plains.}
<LOC>__{EXT.  FEDEX OFFICE - MIDLAND/ODESSA - NIGHT - HOURS LATER}
<ACTION>__{The Driver jams the distinctive Angel Wing Box on top of a dolly and loads it into a CONTAINER with clear plastic sides. A female Loader slaps a large bar code label on the container, scans it, then pulls the container across a belt of rollers onto a larger truck.  The doors of the truck close.  The latch slams down. A forklift hoists the container to the cargo doors of a 737.}

<LOC>__{EXT.  SUPERHUB - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER}
<ACTION>__{One of a seemingly endless line of FedEx planes, our 737 taxis to a gate at the FedEx SUPERHUB.  The Hub is a vast living organism -- loud, complex, overwhelming, as much a symbol of modern life as was the factory in Modern Times. Five thousand people work in a frenzy of interconnected activity inside three vast hangers brightly lit.  Hundreds of forklifts and cargo-pullers dart about, their headlights crisscrossing like a laser show. Loaders quickly roll the container onto a FORKLIFT.}
<LOC>__{INT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The forklift speeds inside one of the hangers to a LOADING BELT, where our Box is spilled into a Mississippi River of packages, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of them, all shapes and sizes, from shoe boxes to engine blocks.  Large mechanical arms divert the immense flow of Workers at dozens of stations.  The packages surge and move. The Workers place the packages label-side-up on new belts, where they're scanned by laser readers.  Picking up speed our Box is shunted across the acres of interlocking belts. The Box ends up in a much larger CONTAINER labeled CDG.}

<ACTION>__{The plane lands.  The container is unloaded down a belt.  We see our Angel Box.  Directly in front of it is a DENTED BOX.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{SERIES OF SHOTS}
<ACTION>__{Night.  The manic activity has come to a dead stop.  Our two Boxes sit on a table in a corner not far from a small Christmas tree. Daylight now.  YURI, a Supervisor, saunters over, picks up the Angel Box, sees an attractive co-worker, puts it down. Night again.  A cat walks by the table where our two Boxes have come to rest.}

<CHAR>__{CHUCK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So how are we going to get this place shaped up?}
<ACTION>__{There's a muttered chorus of answers.}
<CHAR>__{CHUCK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There's only one way.  We have to work together.  Every one of us depends on everyone else.  If one package is late, we are all late.  If one truck misses the deadline, we all miss the deadline. Let's start by taking a look around.}
<ACTION>__{Chuck leads his team through the sorting area.  Yuri squeezes right next to him, ostentatiously carrying a clipboard. Chuck stops.}

<ACTION>__{The Sorter shoves the table against the wall.  Yuri says something to the Translator.}
<CHAR>__{TRANSLATOR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He says they have been very busy.  It is hard to get good employees.  He is sure you understand.}

After only a moment, the light reemerges.  It heads over to his bag.  We go with it. Chuck takes out a roll of toilet paper.  The guy is prepared for anything.  He goes into the bathroom, closes the door. The lights come back on just as the phone rings. We hear scuffling sounds on the other side of the door. Chuck charges out, holding up his pants. Grabs the phone.}

Look, we'll sail the Keys in March.  It's better then anyway. I'll be back before Christmas.  I promise.  I think.  I mean, I will.  I, uh --}
