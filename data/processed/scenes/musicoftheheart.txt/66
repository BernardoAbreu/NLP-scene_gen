<C>__{nick }
<P>__{(whining)}
<D>__{why can't he?}
<A>__{roberta looks distressed by her talk with brian as she and the boys enter, back from the park.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{he just can't, o.k.? brian's at his house tonight, and we're at ours.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{well then i wanna go to his house.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{enough, nick. now why don't you and your brother practice while i make dinner.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i don't feel like practicing.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{well do it anyway.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i wanna go to brian's!}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{stop whining, and get your violin.}
<A>__{nick stomps off to get his violin. lexi follows. roberta puts down her bag and takes off her coat. while lexi sets up his violin, nick opens his violin case, takes out the violin and angrily starts playing, loudly and roughly.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{the problem with you is you're mean to everybody and then they don't want to be with you!}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i've heard just about enough from you, young man. now set your violin up properly and start practicing.}
<A>__{nick throws the violin against the floor. roberta's speechless.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i hate the violin!}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{you pick that violin up right now and don't you ever ever }
<A>__{nick picks up the violin and throws the violin down even harder, then yells at roberta before she can even respond.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it's all your fault! you made daddy leave and you're gonna make brian leave too! you're gonna be all alone and i will have to take care of you!}
<A>__{roberta is stunned. the anger drains out of her as she suddenly sees what this is all about.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{nick you don't have to take care of me.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{then who's going to?}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i will take care of myself and i will take care of you and lexi. i promise.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you didn't try hard enough. you made daddy leave us.}
<A>__{this hits her in the solar plexus. her hurt and vulnerability start to pour out.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{that's not true. i begged him not to leave, but he didn't listen.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{why not?}
<A>__{roberta hesitates, but knows she has to tell them the truth. she addresses both boys.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{your father met someone he liked more than mommy, and then }
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{who?}
<A>__{roberta swallows, shocked to hear him ask this. she can hardly answer him.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{lana. remember our friends lana and tom?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{is he gonna marry her now?}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{no, but he's not coming back... to me.}
<A>__{nick and lexi look very upset, not only from hearing the finality in her words, but from seeing their mother's pain. roberta moves closer to them.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i will take care of you, nick. you too, lexi. i promise. i'm not going anywhere. we're still a family.}
<A>__{nick starts crying. roberta takes him in her arms. lexi starts to cry and roberta holds him too.}
<C>__{roberta}
<P>__{(softly, to both)}
<D>__{i promise.}
