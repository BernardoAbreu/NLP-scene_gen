<L>__{exterior the wallace farmhouse magic hour}
<A>__{the farmhouse looks lonely and forlorn. william stands at the open door, and gazes out at the rain; it leaks on him, through his roof; he doesn't seem to notice.}
<L>__{exterior the macclannough house magic hour}
<A>__{a thatched cottage, lit with a cozy fire, beneath the rain. a hand knocks on the door, and macclannough opens it to find william, on a horse! macclannough frowns.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{good evening, sir. may i speak with your daughter?}
<A>__{mrs. macclannough shoulders up beside her husband, and marion appears behind her scowling parents.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{marion... would you like to go for a ride on this fine evening?}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{the boy's insane!}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{it's good scottish weather, madam, the rain is fallin' straight down.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{she absolutely may not, she'll marion!}
<A>__{marion has grabbed a cloak off the back of the door; she runs out to hop up behind william, and they gallop away. the ride magic hour william and marion race along the heather, up and down hills, through swollen streams. the rain stops, as the sun sets; the scottish mists lift, revealing stunning natural beauty. william stops the horse and they look out over it all together. he speaks, without turning to face her.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{your father doesn't like me, does he?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{it's not you. he dislikes that you're a wallace. he just says... the wallaces don't seem to live for very long.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{thank you for accepting.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{thank you for inviting.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i will invite you again, but your mother thinks i'm crazy.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{you are. and i will come again.}
<A>__{he lingers; he wants to say something, or maybe he just doesn't want the moment to end. finally he spurs the horse.}
