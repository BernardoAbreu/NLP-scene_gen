<L>__{exterior spanky's back alley (1932) night}
<A>__{ray gibson holds up a similar bottle of liquor to a light over a door. music comes from within. he takes a swig and stashes the bottle in his belt. he adjusts his tie, polishes his shoes on the back of his pants and raps on the door.}
<L>__{interior spanky's night}
<A>__{the speakeasy is jumping, jammed with people. up on stage a hot jazz band is playing backup for a seductive chanteuse. well heeled patrons enter through doors near the stage. in the back, at the end of a long hallway, a bouncer cracks open the door and ray squeezes inside.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{oh, no, ray. not tonight. spanky's not happy with you.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{is spanky here?}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{no, but...}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{then what's the problem?}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{but this is where the action is and i have to be where the action is. look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't i come through for you? ain't she stepping in style now?}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{well, alright then. what do you think about this new tie?}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{sharp.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i look good tonight. and i feel lucky, too.}
<A>__{ray heads inside.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{anyone asks, it wasn't me who let you in.}
<A>__{ray slides through the crowd, pausing at the bar to nibble on the neck of a cocktail waitress.}
<C>__{cocktail waitress}
<D>__{don't even try it.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{when do you get off?}
<C>__{cocktail waitress}
<D>__{i get off at two, but you ain't never getting off.}
<A>__{she carries a tray of drinks into the crowd. ray shakes his head in wonderment at her departing form. the barkeep steps up as ray pulls out his bottle.}
<C>__{barkeep}
<D>__{you can't drink that in here, ray.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i sure can't drink that watered down swill you're serving. give me a glass of ice.}
<C>__{barkeep}
<D>__{i can't give you a glass of ice. i can't give you anything until you pay your damn tab.}
<A>__{disregarding the warning, ray tilts the bottle back. shaking his head, the barkeep moves on to a paying customer. ray's eyes follow a bottle of french champagne as it is delivered to a nearby table. here sits the straight laced claude banks with his girlfriend, daisy. she's enjoying the show. he's polishing the silverware. the waiter pours two glasses of champagne and leaves the bottle on ice. claude regards his glass skeptically.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{for the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{claude. here's to your new job down at the bank. i always knew you'd make something of yourself.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{know what i'm going to buy with my first pay check?}
<A>__{daisy thinks she does. she leans in, eyes twinkling.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{season tickets to the yankees. right there on the first base line.}
<P>__{(off her disappointment)}
<D>__{what's wrong, baby?}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{i was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, claude.}
<A>__{french champagne shoots out of claude's nose.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{engagement ring!}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{that's what respectable folks do. get a job, get married, start having babies. that's what you want, isn't it?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{sure it is. i just don't see any reason to rush into things. damn, look at this shirt. i will be right back.}
<A>__{claude leans in to kiss daisy on the lips. she offers her cheek. he departs.}
<B>__{over by the bar}
<A>__{ray watches claude make a beeline for the men's room.}
