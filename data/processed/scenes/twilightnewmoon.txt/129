<A>__{jane leads edward, bella and alice through several narrow, dark alleys. felix and demetri bring up the rear. edward never loosens his grip on bella's hand. their path dead ends at a wall of brick. jane just strides forward and, without breaking pace drops down into an open hole in the street; it's a drain. alice follows jane. bella looks down, sees nothing but blackness.}
