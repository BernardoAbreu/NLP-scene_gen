<L>__{exterior carmes deschaux monastery day}
<A>__{the monastery is a windowless building bordered by a barren field, a dueling ground for men who have little time to waste. athos sits on a stone bench, waits for his adversary to arrive. his horse is hobbled nearby. d'artagnan rides into view, dismounts.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{ten minutes early.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i have another appointment at one.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{you'll miss it, i'm afraid.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i will try my best to be on time.}
<A>__{athos appreciates the young man's retort, takes a closer look. then he rises to his feet, the pain in his arm makes him wince.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{i asked two of my friends to act as seconds, but they are not as punctual.}
<A>__{d'artagnan notices athos' pained expression, the blood on his sleeve.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{but you're wounded.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{don't worry. i fight just as well with my left hand.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{if you'd rather kill me another time...}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{thanks, but i see my seconds coming now.}
<A>__{porthos and aramis arrive on horseback. they dismount, view d'artagnan with amazement. d'artagnan reacts with similar surprise, smiles sheepishly.}
<C>__{porthos}
<P>__{(to athos)}
<D>__{what're you doing? you can't fight this man.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{because i'm fighting him.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{excuse me, monsieur. but not until one o'clock.}
<C>__{aramis}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{wait a minute. i've got a duel with him, too.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{yes, sir. but not until two.}
<C>__{athos}
<P>__{(to d'artagnan)}
<D>__{how long have you been in paris?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i arrived this morning.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{you've been... busy.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i've also fallen in love.}
<C>__{athos}
<P>__{(gruff to a fault)}
<D>__{better to die for love than to live for it. gentlemen?}
<A>__{athos gestures for aramis and porthos to stand aside. he draws his saber, ready to fight. a beat. and in that moment, d'artagnan's face reveals an emotion he has never felt before in his young life. fear. athos sees it, allows him a moment to withdraw his saber. d'artagnan does so, they square off, touch sabers, and... ... jussac leads a patrol of the cardinal's guards into}
<B>__{view.}
<C>__{jussac}
<D>__{there they are!!}
<A>__{athos and d'artagnan separate as jussac and his four swordsmen stride towards them.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{jussac. again.}
<A>__{athos steps forward to meet him.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{i told you the next time we met i'd want an answer. but i didn't expect you so soon.}
<C>__{jussac}
<D>__{the three of you are under arrest. the boy's of no interest to me and is free to go. do you intend to resist?}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{oh, don't be stupid. of course we intend to resist. just give us a second.}
<A>__{porthos huddles with athos and aramis.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{interesting odds. five of them and three of us.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{it hardly seems fair. let's give them the chance to surrender.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{excuse me, but there are four of us.}
<A>__{they turn and regard d'artagnan.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{this is not your fight. you're not a musketeer.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i may not wear the uniform, but i believe i have the heart of a musketeer.}
<A>__{the three musketters exchange smiles. d'artagnan's youthful bravado manages a small dent in their cynicism.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{bold and brave.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{a poet.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{have you got a name, boy?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{d'artagnan.}
<C>__{porthos}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{d'artagnan?}
<A>__{the name has meaning for all of them. the musketeers look at each other, deadpan, shake their heads.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{impossible.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{it couldn't be.}
<A>__{athos knows that it is. he steps forward, extends a hand. the others follow, shake as well. athos introduces each in turn.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{athos... porthos... aramis.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{pleased to meet you... how do you do?... good to see you again...}
<A>__{meanwhile, jussac and his guards look on with increasing impatience. he clears his throat, draws his saber. the musketeers turn toward the guards, d'artagnan standing among them.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{well. now that we're all acquainted...}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{the cardinal's guards.}
<A>__{d'artagnan and the musketeers draw their swords... and charge.}
<B>__{fight}
<A>__{suddenly: nine men are locked in mortal combat. athos takes a guard named cahusac, porthos battles biscarat, and aramis battles with two adversaries at once. d'artagnan looks for an opponent... and finds himself face to face with jussac. the fighting style of the musketeers is an exuberant mixture of styles and techniques. athos is a brutal swordsman, his strokes overpowering and savage. his repertoire also includes swift kicks, solid punches, the occasional elbow when necessary. aramis is a seamless and graceful technician, he handles his two opponents with balletic ease, an artist working with steel and flesh, rather than paint and canvas. and last, and perhaps the most entertaining of all, porthos. he is a walking arsenal, carrying a variety of bizarre weapons on his body a crossbow, daggers, bolo, nunchucks all of which he uses with the polished skill of a master. add this funhouse of armaments to his already impressive size and strength, and you have a oneman wrecking crew of epic proportions. d'artagnan's youthful energy is by now familiar. he bounds about like a newborn tiger, encircles his adversary, changing stance and shifting his ground with alacrity. jussac is having a hard time defending himself against his opponent who seems to be attacking from all directions at once.}
<C>__{jussac}
<P>__{(losing patience)}
<D>__{stand still! how do you expect me to kill you if you keep jumping around!!}
<B>__{monastery}
<A>__{a monk watches from the bell tower, incensed by the battle raging on the field below. he grabs the bell rope, gives it a mighty pull... and sounds a clamorous alarm.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{porthos reacts to the interruption with irritation. he produces a pair of nunchucks. biscarat looks at the odd weapon with professional curiosity, slight confusion... and porthos whacks him on the side of the head, knocks him to the ground.}
<C>__{porthos}
<P>__{(eyes on the tower)}
<D>__{damn monks. always spoiling everybody's fun.}
<A>__{aramis replies while shifting from one foe to the nexterior}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{they are nearer to god...}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{they're about to get a little nearer to the hilt of my sword.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{pagan.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{papist.}
<A>__{porthos slides over to handle one of aramis' opponents. he'd rather bicker from close range. but biscarat struggles to his feet, grabs his saber. porthos sees him, sighs.}
<C>__{porthos}
<P>__{(to aramis)}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i'm fine, thank you.}
<A>__{and porthos returns to his original foe. meanwhile, athos' heavy strokes take their toll. cahusac staggers, wounded in arm, shoulder, grazed at the head and falls to the ground with a thud. aramis calls out to him, indicates d'artagnan:}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{take a look at our young friend.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{you mean he's still alive?}
<A>__{not only is d'artagnan alive, but he's making a fool out of jussac. frustrated, enraged, jussac makes a full lunge at him, but d'artagnan ducks, then slips under jussac's sword like a snake and runs him through. jussac falls to the ground, lies still. he is dead. athos and aramis react, impressed. then turn their full attention on weakening foes. they disarm and disable them with swift strokes. meanwhile, porthos chases biscarat into a grove of trees. the guard has discovered the better part of valor, now runs for his life. porthos who is at play as much as he is war takes a spanish bolo from his cloak, and whips the balls over his head. biscarat hears the odd whizzing sound, turns to face him. the color drains from his face.}
<C>__{biscarat}
<D>__{now what...?}
<A>__{porthos lets the bolo fly it catches biscarat about the neck, the balls slam into his head. the guard drops to the ground without a sound.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{god, i love my work.}
<B>__{aftermath}
<A>__{a sudden silence, save for the occasional dull groan. d'artagnan scans the battlefield, sees aramis bending over jussac's body, speaking in solemn tones under his breath.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(to athos)}
<D>__{what's he doing?}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{last rites. aramis takes death very seriously.}
<A>__{porthos returns in high spirits, stashes the bolo in a pouch under his cloak. d'artagnan sees the other weapons there, including a boomerang. maybe next time.}
<C>__{porthos}
<P>__{(re: the bolo)}
<D>__{do you know where this bolo comes from?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(a bold jest, given the circumstances)}
<D>__{the queen of america?}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{spain.}
<A>__{porthos deadpans, then grins acceptance. all for one, and one for all. d'artagnan beams.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{don't encourage him. by killing jussac, the boy's made himself an outlaw too.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{not if he leaves paris. which is exactly what he's going to do.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i can't leave. i just got here.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{go home, find a wench, live long and prosper.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{why can't i stay with you?}
<A>__{aramis and porthos look to athos. as always, he will decide.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{because i do not want you to.}
<A>__{it's hard to say whether he's acting out of concern for the boy... or he simply doesn't give a damn. whatever the case, d'artagnan is crestfallen. the musketeers mount their horses, porthos and aramis adopt a friendlier tone.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i know athos may seem cold and unfriendly, but don't let that fool you.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{he really is cold and unfriendly.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{but he's also right. this is our fight, not yours. go on, get out of here.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{whatever happened to the motto of the musketeers? 'all for one, and one for all.'}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{wake up, boy. the musketeers are just a dream.}
<A>__{athos spurs his horse, rides away. aramis and porthos follow. hold on d'artagnan as he watches the musketeers grow small in the distance. then, sadly, he steps to his horse, climbs into the saddle. it has been both the best and the worst day of his young life. that's when a group of horsemen come riding around the corner of the monastery five cardinal's guards led by rochefort himself. they see their wounded comrades, jussac dead, and the three musketeers escaping in the distance.}
<C>__{rochefort}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{there they go! after them!}
<A>__{but before rochefort and the guards can give chase, d'artagnan rides into the middle of the field to challenge them, as if to further prove himself worthy of the blue and gold.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(defiant)}
<D>__{long live the musketeers.}
<A>__{and d'artagnan draws his saber.}
<B>__{at distance}
<A>__{the three muskeeters rein their horses, look back to d'artagnan's bold charge.}
<C>__{porthos}
<P>__{(with admiration)}
<D>__{do you believe this kid.}
<A>__{d'artagnan gallops toward the guards to engage them. he races through pistol shots like a demon possessed. rochefort rides to the lead, draws his sword.}
<C>__{rochefort}
<P>__{(shouts to the others)}
<D>__{fall back! i will take him myself!}
<A>__{and like two jousting knights, d'artagnan and rochefort meet in the middle of the field. their blades connect with a resounding clash, d'artagnan is knocked clear of his saddle. he hits the ground with a painful thud. rochefort's guards leap towards him.}
<B>__{angle to include muskeers}
<A>__{porthos and aramis are greatly moved by d'artagnan's courage.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{rochefort's got the boy.}
<C>__{athos}
<P>__{(seemingly unmoved)}
<D>__{too bad.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{you can't just leave him.}
<A>__{athos spurs his horse, rides away. aramis and porthos exchange sad looks and hopeful comments.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{he has a plan.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{definitely. a plan.}
<A>__{and with that, they gallop after.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{meanwhile, d'artagnan is soon outnumbered, and quickly subdued.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{this boy fights like a wildcat.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(exhausted)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{the guard clobbers d'artagnan with the scabbard of his sword. the last thing d'artagnan sees is the three musketeers riding into the distance. then the world tilts, goes suddenly black.}
