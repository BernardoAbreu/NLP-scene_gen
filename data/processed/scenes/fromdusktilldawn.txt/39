<L>__{interior fullers' motel room night}
<A>__{the fullers are in room #12. it's identical to the one that the gecko boys are in, except that the paintings above the beds are different. jacob has fallen asleep in his clothes on the bed. scott sits in a chair, headphones on, playing an unplugged electric guitar. kate is nowhere in sight. knock... knock... knock... on the door. scott doesn't hear shit but his music. jacob stirs a bit, but doesn't wake up. pound... pound... pound... on the door. jacob springs up. he looks over at scott, who, lost in guitar heaven, is oblivious of the knocker, then to the door.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{from the other side of the door comes a friendly voice.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{i'm your neighbor in room 9, i hate to disturb you, but i'd like to ask a favor.}
<A>__{jacob swings his feet to the floor, stands up and walks to the door. as he passes scott, he says, in his direction }
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i hope none of this is disturbing you.}
<A>__{scott can't hear him, but when he sees his dad look at him, he smiles. jacob opens the door and sees... ... richard gecko standing in the doorway, looking like the nicest guy in the entire world.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{hi there, i'm from room 9, my name is don cornelius. no, not the don cornelius from soul train. me and my lady friend need some ice and we don't seem to have an ice bucket. could we possibly borrow yours? i will bring it right back.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(still partially asleep)}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{we follow jacob as he turns to the dresser to get the motel ice bucket. he grabs it, turns back to the door, takes a couple of steps towards it, then stops: in his tracks. he sees richard and seth both inside the room with the door closed, both with .45's in their hands, both aimed at him.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what is this?}
<A>__{seth slugs jacob in the mouth, knocking him to the ground.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{it's called a punch.}
<A>__{scott suddenly becomes aware of what's going on around him and instinctively stands. richard shoves his .45 in scott's mouth.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{sit down.}
<A>__{scott lowers himself back down onto his seat.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{good boy.}
<A>__{jacob lifts his head off the floor and wipes blood away from his lip. he looks at his opponent who stands over him.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(to jacob)}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{jacob.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{okay, jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. make a wrong move and i will shoot you in the face.}
<A>__{jacob rises and sits on the edge of the bed.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(to richard)}
<D>__{okay, move the jap over there.}
<A>__{keeping the gun in scott's mouth, richard makes scott rise...}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{upsy daisy.}
<A>__{...guiding him over to the bed by his father. richard removes the gun from scott's mouth and stands next to his brother, looking down at their two hostages.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(to his hostages)}
<D>__{what's the story with you two? you a couple of fags?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{he's my son.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{how does that happen? you don't look japanese.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{neither does he. he looks vietnamese.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{oh, well, excuse me all to hell.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what's this about, money?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{it's about money, all right, but not yours. you see, me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance.}
<A>__{the door to room #12 opens and a dripping wet, bikini clad kate walks in. the brothers spin their guns in her direction. kate, startled, screams. jacob and scott get on their feet and move forward. seth spins back towards the two men, gun ready to spit.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(to scott and jacob)}
<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{jacob and scott freeze. richard moves like quicksilver, shutting the door and positioning himself behind the terrified kate.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{we're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(to kate)}
<D>__{it's okay, honey. everything's going to be all right.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid.}
<P>__{(he turns to jacob and scott, who are still standing)}
<D>__{you two, simon says sit the fuck down!}
<A>__{they slowly sit. richard can't take his eyes off the dripping wet kate. both jacob and seth see this and neither men like it. both for their own reasons.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(to jacob)}
<D>__{where are the keys to the motor home?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{on the dresser.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{richie, take the keys. start that big bastard up, and drive it up front.}
<A>__{richard doesn't move from his position behind kate. kate feels his eyes on her. she slowly turns and looks at him. he looks in her face. close up kate she smiles at him.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?}
<A>__{close up richard}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{seth }
<D>__{richard!}
<A>__{richard's eyes go to seth. everybody is where they were. kate never turned around.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{not when you get around to it, now.}
<A>__{without saying a word, he takes the keys and leaves the room.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(pointing at kate)}
<D>__{you, gidget, go in the bathroom and put on some clothes.}
<A>__{she grabs some clothes from the floor and moves towards the bathroom. seth grabs her wrist.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you got three minutes. one second longer, i shoot your father in the face. do you understand what i just said?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{do you believe me?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you damn well better. go.}
<A>__{she goes into the bathroom.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{look, if you want the motor home, just take it and get out.}
<A>__{seth grabs a chair and slides it up to his two male hostages.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{sorry, pops, it ain't gonna be that easy.}
<A>__{we hear the motor home "honk" twice outside.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{get ready to move out, we're all going on a little ride.}
<A>__{jacob shakes his head "no."}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{not a chance.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{come again?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{if you're taking people, take me. but my kids aren't going anywhere with you.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{sorry, i need everybody.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{my children are not going with you, and that's that.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{that's not fuckin' that...}
<P>__{(holds up his gun)}
<D>__{this is fuckin' this.}
<P>__{(he calms down and looks at scott)}
<D>__{go sit over there.}
<A>__{scott gets up and walks to the other side of the room, leaving the two men alone. seth speaks in a quiet, conversational tone.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i ain't got time to fuck around with you, so i will make this simple. take your kids and get in the car, or i will execute all three of you right now.}
<P>__{(he cocks the gun and puts it right in jacob's face)}
<D>__{what's it gonna be, yes or no answer?}
<A>__{jacob looks at him.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{good.}
<P>__{(to scott)}
<D>__{your old man's all right, he just saved your life.}
<A>__{seth bangs on the bathroom door.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{times up, princess.}
<A>__{the bathroom door opens. kate stands there, wearing a t shirt, jeans and bare feet.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{okay, ramblers, let's get to rambling.}
