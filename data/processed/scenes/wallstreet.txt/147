<L>__{interior reception area gekko's office day}
<A>__{bud walks intently past the receptionist and down the long white marble hall.}
<L>__{interior natalie's desk day}
<A>__{natalie is on the phone. bud marches past her desk.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{yes, he wants to change that appointment to...}
<P>__{(cupping the receiver)}
<D>__{bud you can't go in there. he's in a meeting!}
<A>__{he ignores her and throws open gekko's door.}
<L>__{interior gekko's office day}
<A>__{gekko is talking with the lawyers and bankers from the bluestar deal, as bud barges in.}
<C>__{gekko}
<P>__{(looks up)}
<D>__{i didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i'm sorry, this can't wait.}
<A>__{gekko stares at him with piercing eyes.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{will you gentlemen excuse us for a few minutes?}
<A>__{the lawyers and bankers get up and discreetly leave the room. gekko waits for them to go, turns back to bud.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{what the hell do you want?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i found out about the garage sale down at bluestar. why?}
<A>__{gekko is taken by surprise.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{last night i read rudy the story of winnie the pooh and the honey pot. know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{maybe you ought to read him pinocchio. you told me you were going to turn bluestar around. not upside down. you used me.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{you're walking around blind without a cane, sport. a fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{why do you need to wreck this company?}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{because it's wreckable. i took another look and i changed my mind.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{if these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. my father worked at bluestar for twenty four years. i gave 'em my word.}
<C>__{gekko}
<P>__{(hard)}
<D>__{it's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...}
<P>__{(loosening)}
<D>__{bud, you're still going to be president. and when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. with the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{tell me, gordon when does it all end? how many yachts can you waterski behind? how much is enough?}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{buddy, it's not a question of enough. it's a zero sum game, sport. somebody wins and somebody loses. money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. like magic. that painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. i could sell it today for $600,000. the illusion has become real. and the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. capitalism at its finest.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{how much is enough gordon?}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{the richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. one third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what i do stock and real estate speculation. it's bullshit. ninety percent of the american people have little or no net worth. i create nothing; i own. we make the rules, buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.}
<P>__{(picking one up)}
<D>__{we pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...}
<P>__{(crosses to bud)}
<D>__{...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, buddy? it's the free market. you're one of us now...take advantage of it. you got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. i got things to teach you...}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{obviously...}
<A>__{as he puts his arm around bud, leading him to the door.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{believe me, buddy, i was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. bring darien...}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(at the door, confused, drained)}
<D>__{...i can't make it tonight.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{are you with me buddy?}
<A>__{at the door, a look of unmistakable power...and danger.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{i want you with me.}
<P>__{(waits)}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i'm with you gordon...}
<A>__{he walks out the door, the misery he is in washing his brow.}
<C>__{gekko}
<P>__{(to natalie)}
<D>__{...be another minute, natalie.}
<A>__{as he crosses back to the coffee table and punches up a phone number.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{this is gordon gekko. now...}
<P>__{(a beat, with controlled rage)}
<D>__{i want zip locked mouths on bluestar, or i'm gonna personally come down there and rip out your fucking throats!}
