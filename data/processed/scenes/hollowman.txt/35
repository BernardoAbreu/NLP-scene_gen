<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{so superman's flying around the city, and he's horny as hell. lo and behold he looks down and sees wonder woman, completely nude, sunning herself up on the roof of the justice league. i mean she is lying there naked and spread eagle. so superman starts thinking, "man... this is too easy. i could go down there, do a little fast pumping and be gone before she even sees me." after all he is faster than a speeding bullet, right? anyway, he swoops down, takes care of business so quick, you can't even see him. well ... i tell ya. wonder woman looks up, surprised as hell and says "what the hell was that." and the invisible man replies "i dunno know, but it sure hurt like hell."}
