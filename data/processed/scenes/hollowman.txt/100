<L>__{interior conference room night}
<A>__{matt hands out thermal goggles, while frank loads and passes out tranquilizer guns.}
<C>__{janice}
<D>__{what are the tranqs for?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{use your imagination.}
<C>__{janice}
<D>__{are you saying he's dangerous?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{we're just saying we need to be cautious.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{the metro stops running after midnight and he's on foot, so he can't have gotten too far.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{look, this isn't a monkey we're talking about. it's dr. caine. don't you think you're over reacting?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{this program is classified. if he's out there it means someone might find out about him. he could destroy the whole program.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{relax, linda. no one's gonna find out.}
<A>__{they all turn around. at the door is sebastian, back in his latex outfit.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{where the hell have you been?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i got a little stir crazy, so i went to my apartment to pick up some stuff.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{bullshit! i went to your apartment and i happen to know you did a helluva lot more than pick some stuff up.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{you, of all people how could you?}
<A>__{caught dead to rights, sebastian sinks into his chair. he thinks she knows.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{you put yourself and this project at risk.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{just what did you see in my apartment?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i saw your face and your clothes.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it was bad enough you left without an escort, but to take off the...}
<P>__{(he motions to his face)}
<D>__{out in public?}
<A>__{sebastian realizes that they don't know.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{don't make a mountain out of molehill. i didn't let anyone see me.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{that's not good enough. when you're outside the lab there are a thousand variables none of us can control. it's just not safe for you to be out there.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{come on, linda. you don't expect me to be some kind of prisoner.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{you volunteered for this, sebastian. you knew going in there could be consequences.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{for the security of this project, i'm gonna have to ask you to confine yourself to the compound.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i'm still project leader, linda. it's my decision to make.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{you're right. it's your decision. but if you leave the compound again, i will notify the oversight committee. then they can make the decision. you understand?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{matt?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{sorry, man. you'd do the same if it were the other way around.}
<A>__{a long beat. sebastian slowly rises, acknowledges linda with a nod and leaves the room. linda looks around at her silent co workers, the goggles and tranqs still on the table.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{pack 'em up... everyone go home.}
