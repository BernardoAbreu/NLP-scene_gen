<A>__{julianne has cleaned up pretty good. she sits with digger on a fashion fabric sofa. they are side by side, studying something with equal concentration. and slight concern.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{i suppose it's too late to start over.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{it's too late to start over.}
<A>__{pull back to reveal michael in his wedding tux, submitting to a final fitting from a stylish fitter.}
<C>__{michael}

<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{like i said, dazzling.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{is she going to dress you every day?}
<A>__{michael smiles over. digger smiles back. they live each other.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yeah, it's in the contract.}
<C>__{digger}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{well, then, i will take it up with her.}
<A>__{michael motions, okay, c'mon over. digger rises, goes to michael, the fitter steps back as digger shows him...}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{the cut here, here... this line...}
<A>__{fingers lightly traveling over the lapel, the side stitching, the cloth straight down the spine...}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{... trouser width, this is all classic. which means safe, something i'd wear.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i should look different.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{you should look like you dressed yourself.}
<A>__{yes? michael's grin is back. playful and friendly.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{and i'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a new yorker?}
<C>__{digger}
<P>__{(quiet smile)}
<D>__{something like that.}
<A>__{julianne loves that the boy are getting on.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(means this)}
<D>__{long trip. pretty nice of you to come.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{well, i'm close to her. i wanted to meet the one that got away.}
<A>__{said so naturally. that embarrasses michael, who looks down, his smile suddenly awkward.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.}
<A>__{steals a glance at julianne. she rolls her eyes. what a goofball, my outrageous friend.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(to digger)}
<D>__{stay, huh?}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{i honestly wish i could...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i will call george's parents. tell them i need a best man who actually looks after me.}
<A>__{julianne comes over.}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{they'd say that's my job.}
<A>__{she runs her hands over his jacket, smoothing it everywhere. with tenderness that approaches transparency. glances back at digger...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i will take it home from here.}
<A>__{pinches michael's ear. looks in his eyes.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{two words.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{major. dish.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{manicure...}
<A>__{she looks down. michael's nails are unclipped, with layers of impacted dirt. she touches his fingertips, a little more softly than she may have intended.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{fly.}
<A>__{everyone looks down. she zips michael up.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(to digger)}
<D>__{you don't miss much.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{part of being a new yorker.}
