<A>__{carnby lies on a bed with his shirt off. fischer runs the hand held scanner over carnby's torso. he looks at the results of carnby's scan on a monitor. a spinal worm is visible around carnby's spine. but it looks different than the others. it is small and shriveled and seems barely attached to the spine.}
