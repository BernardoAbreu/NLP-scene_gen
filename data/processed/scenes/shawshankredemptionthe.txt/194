<D>__{lights out!}
<A>__{the lights bump off. he finishes polishing, holds up the piece to admire. a pawn. he sets it down with the others and we realize it's the final glance for the board. a full set. he gazes up at racquel and smiles. pulls a six foot length of rope from under his pillow. lets it uncoil to the floor.}
