<L>__{exterior burch's dungeon yard day}
<A>__{it is a yard just beyond burch's. the yard is hemmed in by a brick wall. in the yard are two men, and a boy. the oldest is clemens ray a man of about 25 years of age. he is well educated. john williams is about 20 years old. he is born and bred a slave, is lacking in education, and overwhelmed with fear of the situation. finally there is a child about 10 years of age who answers to the name of randall. solomon, clemens ray, john and randall all stand naked. though they try to cover their privates a bit, they are all aware of the uselessness of modesty. radburn is present. he has before him a couple of buckets of cold water. he throws water on the naked men.}
<C>__{radburn}
<D>__{go on. warsh up.}
<A>__{the men, soaking in humility as well as water, begin to scrub with a single bar of harsh soap passed among them.}
<C>__{radburn }
<D>__{the boy, too. get him clean.}
<A>__{solomon takes some soap and rubs it over randall.}
<C>__{radburn }
<D>__{scrub now. git 'em clean.}
<A>__{solomon scrubs harder. randall clearly cold and uncomfortable appeals to solomon.}

<D>__{do you know when my mama will come?}
<C>__{radburn}
<D>__{hush him up!}
<A>__{seeing solomon has no answer for him, randall begins to cry.}
<C>__{randall}
<D>__{mama ..! mama! is she going to come?}
<A>__{doing all he can to spare the child from a certain beating:}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{quiet, please.}
<A>__{randall is becoming nearly inconsolable.}
<C>__{randall}
<D>__{mama!}
<A>__{saying anything to keep the boy quiet:}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{your mother will come, i swear she will, but you must be silent. please. be silent!}
<A>__{on the seeming strength of solomon's promise, randall goes silent. solomon looks to radburn, who just throws water on the soapy men.}
