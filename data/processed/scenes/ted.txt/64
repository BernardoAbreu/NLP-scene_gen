<C>__{lori}
<D>__{whatever you say, baby.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hey, here's to four more years, huh?}
<A>__{they clink glasses, and take a sip.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{now i know we said no gifts, but }
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{no, we didn't.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{ but, i got you something anyway, in clear violation of the "no gift" rule.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{there was no such rule.}
<A>__{john reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a small box. lori looks excited.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{lori, i've wanted to give this to you for a long time.}
<A>__{john slides the box over to lori. she picks it up.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{oh, john.}
<A>__{lori unwraps the box and opens it. inside is a pair of nice, but not super expensive looking earrings.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{those are the ones you liked, right? from that kiosk at the mall?}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{oh. yeah.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{check out the card.}
<A>__{she opens up the card, which we see as john describes it. it says, "happy 4 year anniversary! love you."}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{see, i even wrote the words with different colored markers so you wouldn't get bored while you were reading it.}
<C>__{lori}
<P>__{(unenthused)}
<D>__{great. thanks. well, um, here. this is for you.}
<A>__{lori hands john a small box. he opens it up, revealing a very nice watch.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(opens box)}
<D>__{oh wow, a hamilton!}
<A>__{he puts it on his wrist.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{i remember you liked it when you saw tom brady wearing one in gq.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yeah, i mean his was analog, but this is so awesome, i love it!}
<A>__{she reacts a bit to this.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{y'know, lori...}
<P>__{(indicating box)}
<D>__{someday, there's gonna be a ring in there. but i wanna wait `til i can get you something really special, y'know? i just don't have the money right now.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{john, i don't need the hope diamond, all i want is }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i know, but it's important to me that you have the engagement ring you deserve. and what with the credit bubble... the supreme court... i mean, look at haiti.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{look, i'm only saying this because i love you, but that's not realistic. you're never gonna have any kind of a career if you're always partying and wasting time with ted.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh, jesus, here we go }
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{john, please get him to find his own place, so we can get on with our lives.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{look, can we talk about this another time, and just enjoy our anniversary dinner?}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{yeah. fine. let's talk about it ten years from now.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(rolling his eyes with a sigh)}
<D>__{lori, we can't talk about this every time we go out. look, he's been my best friend since i was eight. and i was not a popular child. you have to understand, i had no friends before he came along. he's the only reason i ever gained any fucking confidence. i coulda wound up like that asian kid at virginia tech, but i didn't. `cause of him. so, y'know, i'm not that psyched to just, like, kick him out.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{well, it's good to know that a talking teddy bear is the only thing that kept you from gunning down your classmates, but john, you're not eight. you're thirty five. and unless you're too blind to notice, he's not your only friend anymore. you have me. and i love you.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i love you, too. you know that.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{look, i've put the best physical years of my life into this. i mean, i'm cute now, but in a few years my body's gonna fall off a fucking cliff. things'll be hanging and stretching in ways that might scare a man. i need to feel secure in the fact that you won't leave me when that happens.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{not only will i not leave you, it's gonna be even better. `cause i can have sex with you, and press your arm fat against a comic book so i can see it backwards.}
<A>__{she laughs. so does he.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{and, my boobs and vagina will all be in the same place, so that's a lot less movin' around for you.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i can do it all with one hand.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{exactly, and you can do whatever you want with the other hand.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i can write a novel. maybe a bestseller.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{we can achieve critical acclaim and become rich just by screwing each other.}
<A>__{they both laugh hard.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{well, i hope these jokes have distracted you from the actual problems in our relationship.}
<C>__{lori}
<P>__{(sigh)}
<D>__{we can't put the real conversation off forever, john.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i dunno, i got a lotta fuckin' jokes.}
