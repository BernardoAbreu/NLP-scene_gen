<L>__{interior cynthia's apartment bedroom night}
<A>__{divinci and cynthia are lying in bed. divinci has his arm around her, but he's staring at the ceiling.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{what's so interesting up there?}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{then why's it got all your attention?}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{i'm thinkin', that's all.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{about us?}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{divinci looks at cynthia.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{what if i was thinkin' about us?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{don't waste your time.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{what if i was?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{where's it gonna get us?}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{maybe i got plans.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i don't wanna hear 'em. plans just make you think somethin's gonna get better. i'm fine now. i don't need to get screwed up waitin' for something good to happen.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{i just want you to know, love is important to me.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{me, too.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{but more important is loyalty. nothing is more important than that. not love, not anything. because loyalty is about respect. you can talk about love all you want, but without respect it's empty. i mean the first thing that goes in a marriage is respect. and once it's gone, forget the love. so i am telling you, i am loyal to you. like i'm loyal to my partner. we are closer than blood. and i trust him with my life.}
<A>__{cynthia didn't really expect this from divinci. she's actually, despite herself, a little touched.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{why're you telling me this?}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{when you asked if i was thinkin' about us and i said i wasn't, i just want you to know that i do.}
<A>__{a beat, then }
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{just don't ask me to marry you.}
<C>__{divinci}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{why aren't more women like you?}
<A>__{divinci leans in and they kiss.}
