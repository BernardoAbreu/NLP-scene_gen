<A>__{another day late afternoon travis' taxi is driving down broadway with the "off duty" sign on. pov tracking shot down broadway. camera stops at palantine campaign headquarters. a few workers remain in the office. betsy's desk is vacant. fifth avenue the same afternoon camera tracks with crowded mass of manhattanites as they ooze through the sidewalks toward their various destination. individuals are indiscernible: it is simply a congested mass.}

<D>__{i first saw her at palantine campaign headquarters at 58th and broadway. she was wearing a yellow dress, answering the phone at her desk.}
<A>__{suddenly: cut of the congested human mass, in slowing motion, appears the slender figure of betsy in a stylish yellow dress. the crowd parts like the red sea, and there she is: walking all alone, untouched by the crowd, suspended in space and time.}
<D>__{travis (v.o.)(contd) she appeared like an angel out of this open sewer. out of this filthy mass. she is alone: they cannot touch her.}
