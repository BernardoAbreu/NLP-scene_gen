<A>__{of course. how long has it been? that poor security guard. she checks the car clock. it's only 85 minutes since she left the house! hard to believe. feels like another lifetime. another cop car whizzes past the line. how long before they come for her? she's got to get back to the kids. della adjusts the rearview mirror. her gaunt bloody face looks back.}
