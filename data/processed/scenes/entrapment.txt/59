<L>__{exterior deck night}
<A>__{mac leads her along the empty moonlit deck to... ...the bowsprit, a long, narrow platform, ringed by a flimsy rail, it juts far out above a churning sea. the whipping of the wind makes it seem all the more precarious.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{it only looks dangerous...}
<A>__{holds out his hand. she hesitates.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you couldn't fall off. unless someone threw you over.}
<A>__{gives her the smile. she puts her hand in his, and they hop up to the platform. walk its length to the very end. he turns now, leans casually against the fragile railing. they are inches apart.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{more intimate. for a confession.}
<A>__{gin looks down at the plume of wake leaping off the bow.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{what business. you are actually. in.}

<C>__{gin}
<D>__{yeh. i'm not an art dealer.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{of course not. you're a cop.}

<C>__{gin }

<A>__{his head tilts. just a little farther.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{nope?}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i'm a thief, mac.}
<A>__{holds the look.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{for five years, i've used the database of every client webber has to plan my jobs. museums, banks, jewelers, rich people, i have floor plans, alarm codes, passwords, the works.}
<A>__{his face absolutely neutral. unreadable.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i've made a fortune. it's not enough.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{why n...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{why wasn't it enough for you?}
<A>__{he falls silent.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{the vermeer that was stolen from hancock tower? that was my job. i scaled the building with electromagnets, and parachuted down an air vent...}
<A>__{no smile at her lips. strictly business.}

<D>__{imagine my relief.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i need a partner. for the biggest, smartest, job. ever. the one you retire off of, because nothing else could ever compare with the rush.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{ever. is such a long time.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{this is a job that can only be done in one place, in one split second in human history. if we miss that instant. we lose.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{and it's worth...?}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{eight billion dollars. that's eight thousand million .}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{how much in shillings?}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{you're not a real trusting guy.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{and i tried so hard to hide that.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{it's two jobs. the first steals something priceless from the national palace museum in taipei. we don't keep that. we trade it in for our ticket to the show.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{one moment in time, you s...}

<C>__{mac}
<D>__{your share is 50%. and one dollar.}
<A>__{her hard stare. and then, she smiles. just barely. still in his arms...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i like what you left. in the hold.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you didn't even see wha...}
<C>__{gin}
