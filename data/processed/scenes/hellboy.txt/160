<A>__{unconscious, abe floats in a special tank. led strips read water temperature, ph level, etc. he's encased in a bio cast: a cybernetic healing unit wrapped around his thorax and right arm. a web of tubes and hoses keeps him in place. shirtless and bandaged, hellboy sits and studies him, as if in a trance.}
<C>__{manning's voice}
<D>__{he'll make it }
<A>__{hellboy turns, manning is there:}
<C>__{manning}
<D>__{but not everyone was so lucky.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{two agents died today. clay probably won't survive the night. you're reckless.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{i knew those men better than you did }
<C>__{manning}
<D>__{ah, i see. that makes it all alright then.}
<A>__{he turns to leave. hellboy gets up.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{no, it doesn't make it right, but i stopped that creature, didn't i?}
<C>__{manning}
<D>__{that's what you do. that's why we need you. you have an insight.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know monsters.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{what are you trying to say?}
<C>__{manning}
<D>__{in the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there there's still one left: you.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<P>__{(a deep sigh)}
<D>__{i wish i could be more gracious but }
<A>__{bammmmm!!!! he smashes a metal locker with his stone hand and raises it above his head. manning cowers, realizing that hellboy's rage is a dangerous thing.}
