<C>__{tanjo }
<D>__{we'll stop soon. we're far enough now.}
<A>__{ivan nods. tanjo cranes into the back of the van. he turns on an overhead light, revealing... five girls. huddled in the back.}
<D>__{tanjo (russian) (cont'd) so you want to testify?}
<A>__{all the girls turn to... raya. their conscience paralyzed by the need to survive. terrified, raya looks to... luba. her eyes pleading for support. but luba turns away.}
<C>__{tanjo }
<D>__{it's okay. we all move to a new bar now. somewhere no one will come look for you. then we have a conversation.}
<A>__{the girls avoid raya's gaze. she sobs. tanjo turns off the light. the van drives off into the unknown.}
