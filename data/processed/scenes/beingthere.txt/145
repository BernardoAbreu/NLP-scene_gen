<P>__{(holds up paper, reads)}
<D>__{... 'i do not regret having political differences with men that i respect; i do regret, however, that our philosophies kept us apart.' ... 'i have no use for those on welfare, no patience whatsoever... but, if i am to be honest with myself, i must admit that they have no use for me, either.' ... 'i was born into a position of extreme wealth, i have spent many sleepless nights thinking about extreme poverty i do not know the feelings of being poor, and that is not to know the feelings of the majority of people in this world. for a man in my position, that is inexcusable.' 'life is a state of mind.' ... 'when i was a boy, i was told that the lord fashioned us from his own image. that's when i decided to manufacture mirrors.'}
