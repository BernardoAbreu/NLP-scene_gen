<A>__{as the "top story" logo is splashed across the screen, accompanied by a catchy tv theme, robert hawkins introduces america's highest rated 'news magazine' show.}
<C>__{robert hawkins}
<D>__{good evening, i'm robert hawkins and this is top story. tonight we bring you an exclusive interview with stephen geller who horrified the nation two years ago when he went berserk and murdered three clerks in a manhattan shoe store. but now, mr. geller's claim, spoken softly and articulately, is that he is the victim. according to mr. geller, the events of that fateful day were not his fault but were the fault of his psychiatrist. hard to believe...watch.}

<A>__{videocamera slowly zooms out and pans over to emil, sitting on the hotel bed watching the tv. he looks at us.}
<C>__{emil }
<D>__{louder.}
<A>__{oleg's hand reaches in front of the lens turning up the volume. the scene cuts back to stephen geller being interviewed by robert hawkins and his camera crew. he's sitting on the front lawn of a mental institution in a paint stained shirt. a showing of his artwork is displayed in the background. patients peruse the paintings of weird dysfunctional faces that avoid eye contact. one of the paintings depicts eddie flemming and leon jackson.}
<C>__{stephen geller}
<D>__{this had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. these people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.}
<C>__{robert hawkins}
<D>__{your doctor?}
<C>__{stephen geller}
<D>__{yes. my psychiatrist didn't insist that i stay on my medication.}
<C>__{robert hawkins}
<D>__{...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?}
<C>__{stephen geller}
<D>__{it was my finger that pulled the trigger, but i'm not morally responsible. my psychiatrist knew what i was capable of. how could i know. i'm not a doctor.}
<C>__{robert hawkins}
<D>__{you seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.}
<C>__{stephen geller}
<D>__{look, i'm a victim here, too. i was a year away from getting my masters in art, now i will never graduate. my life has been permanently disrupted.}
<C>__{robert hawkins}
<D>__{permanently disrupted? aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money? hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?}
<C>__{stephen geller}
<D>__{look, i'm in here. you call this a career move?}
<C>__{robert hawkins}
<D>__{and isn't there a movie in the works about you?}
<C>__{stephen geller}
<D>__{we're in negotiations, that's correct.}
<C>__{robert hawkins}
<D>__{but doesn't the son of sam law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?}
<C>__{stephen geller}
<D>__{that doesn't apply to me because i'm not a criminal. i'm not a criminal! i wasn't convicted.}
<A>__{emil leans forward listening. fascinated.}
<C>__{emil}
<D>__{i love america. no one is responsible for what they do.}
<A>__{there's a knock on the door. our videocamera pov swings over to it. then whips back to emil. emil looks at us.}
<C>__{emil }
<D>__{get in the bathroom!}
<C>__{oleg }
<D>__{whatever we do we fuck her, right?}
<C>__{emil}
<D>__{oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!}
<A>__{emil turns off the tv. our pov backs into the bathroom, closing the door but leaving it open a crack. emil looks down at his shoe. the pov pans down to the kitchen knife sticking out of emil's boot. emil's hands pull his pants cuff over it. pov pans up to emil as he moves to the door and opens it. it's not daphne and she's not world class.}
<C>__{honey}
<D>__{hi, i'm honey.}

<D>__{where's czech girl?}
<C>__{honey}
<D>__{baby, i'm anybody you want me to be. i'm a little schoolgirl, i'm mommy, i'm a czech girl.}

<D>__{now i like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure. why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.}
<C>__{emil}
<D>__{i ordered a czech girl. daphne, you know her?}
<A>__{oleg zooms in for a close up of honey. during the rest of the scene oleg films her. honey begins to undress.}
<C>__{honey}
<D>__{it's an outcall service run out of an apartment. i don't meet the other girls. aren't you gonna get undressed?}
<C>__{emil}
<D>__{where is escort service?}
<C>__{honey}

<C>__{emil}
<D>__{i like to talk to the person who runs the service. can you give me address?}

<D>__{look, man, i don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.}
<A>__{emil pulls the knife out of his boot and shoves her against the door, pushing the blade against her throat suddenly furious like he was before killing milos and tamina.}
<C>__{emil}
<D>__{give me the address!!}
<C>__{honey}
<D>__{alright, alright don't hurt me! please, it's in my book, in my purse!}
<A>__{emil backs off as she reaches for her purse, and comes out with a can of mace, spraying emil's face! emil stumbles backwards oleg holding him in the frame. he whip pans back to honey as she grabs her clothes, unlocking the door but emil's hand slams it shut! emil turns blindly, rubbing his burning eyes guarding the door. honey darts toward the bathroom she pushes open the door and runs into oleg who is videotaping her. horrified, she turns around as emil smashes her in the face so hard she topples backwards, tripping into the bathtub, pulling the shower curtain down on her! like a panther out for the kill, emil pounces. oleg films as emil lifts his hand, gripping...}
