<D>__{yes, i don't know what to make of it.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{i suppose computers have been known to be wrong.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.}

<D>__{i wouldn't worry too much about the computer. first of all, there is still a chance that he is right, despite your tests, and if it should happen again, we suggest eliminating this possibility by allowing the unit to remain in place and seeing whether or not it actually fails. if the computer should turn out to be wrong, the situation is still not alarming. the type of obsessional error he may be guilty of is not unknown among the latest generation of hal 9000 computers. it has almost always revolved around a single detail, such as the one you have described, and it has never interfered with the integrity or reliability of the computer's performance in other areas. no one is certain of the cause of this kind of malfunctioning. it may be over programming, but it could also be any number of reasons. in any event, it is somewhat analogous to human neurotic behavior. does this answer your query? zero five three zero, mc, transmission concluded.}

<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{you know that we checked the two ao units that you reported in imminent failure condition?}
<C>__{hal}

<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{you probably also know that we found them okay.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{yes, i know that. but i can assure you that they were about to fail.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{well, that's just not the case, hal. they are perfectly all right. we tested them under one hundred per cent overload.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{i'm not questioning your word, dave, but it's just not possible. i'm not capable of being wrong.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{hal, is there anything bothering you? anything that might account for this problem?}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{look, dave, i know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but i can assure the problem is with the ao units, and with your test gear.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{okay, hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{i'm sorry you feel the way you do, dave. if you'd like to check my service record, you'll see it's completely without error.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{i know all about your service record, hal, but unfortunately it doesn't prove that you're right now.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{dave, i don't know how else to put this, but it just happens to be an unalterable fact that i am incapable of being wrong.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{yes, well i understand you view on this now, hal.}
<A>__{bowman turns to go.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{you're not going to like this, dave, but i'm afraid it's just happened again. my fpc predicts the ao unit will go within forty eight hours.}
