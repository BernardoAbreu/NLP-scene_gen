<L>__{exterior shopwell's parking lot continuous}
<A>__{the cop car is spinning donuts in the middle of the empty lot. it stops. fogell and officer michaels get out, both smiling. the driver side window rolls down, reveal slater.}
<C>__{officer slater}
<D>__{alright, boys. what i'm about to show you is pretty much the greatest move in donut spinning history. behold: the reverse figure eight.}
<A>__{slater drives to the other side of the lot.}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{so, like, what's your official position?}
<C>__{officer michaels}
<D>__{if you were in, you were in. you are no longer a virgin, end of story. screw cumming.}
<A>__{suddenly, slater guns it and speeds across the lot, slamming the breaks, spinning wildly in several erratic donuts backward donuts. slater completely loses control of the car. he smashes through a bunch of shopping carts and slams into a light post, completely fucking up the cruiser. slater tries to open his door, but it won't budge. he crawls out the missing windshield, slumping onto the ground.}
<C>__{officer slater}
<D>__{alright. i think that's all the fun we're gettin' out of this one.}
