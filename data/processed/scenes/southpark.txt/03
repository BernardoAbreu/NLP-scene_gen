<A>__{from the back, we see the blond haired kid sit up from his bed. he stretches, and then walks over to his closet. we still only see the boy from the back as he reaches in his closet and pulls out an orange coat. the kid puts his coat on, then turns to camera and pulls the hood shut, so that we never get a good look at his face.}
