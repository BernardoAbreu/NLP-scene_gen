<D>__{you know, the israelis...}
<A>__{jordan recoils. christ, how long has he been there? just standing in the doorway?}
<C>__{the chief}
<D>__{... they tried women in the 1967 war. female soldiers.}
<A>__{with forced calm, jordan squeaks off the water and finds a towel.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{permission to get dressed, sir?}
<C>__{the chief}
<D>__{it seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs. israeli men would linger over wounded females often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives. they don't use women anymore.}
<C>__{jordan}
<P>__{(moving closer)}
<D>__{sir, someone mentioned you received the navy cross. may i ask what you got it for?}
<C>__{the chief}
<D>__{for pulling a 210 pound man out of a burning barrack in saudi arabia.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i see. so when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. but when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.}

<D>__{could you have pulled that 210 pound man clear, lieutenant?}
<A>__{she can't say yes. she wants to but can't.}
<C>__{the chief}
<D>__{females in combat situations impact unit cohesion. men fight better without women around. and that is an historical fact.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{it also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir. so maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.}
<A>__{she shoulders past. the chief gives her a few steps before dropping his bomb:}
<C>__{the chief}
<D>__{england went out with a stress fracture. that puts you in charge, lieutenant.}
<C>__{jordan}
<P>__{(off balance)}
<D>__{mccool's that same rank. we're both j.g.'s.}
<C>__{the chief}
<D>__{you were commissioned one month earlier, which makes you the senior officer.}
<P>__{(passing her on his way out)}
<D>__{remember. there are no bad crews only bad leaders.}
