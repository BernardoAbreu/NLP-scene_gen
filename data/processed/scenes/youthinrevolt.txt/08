<A>__{nick regards jerry from across the dining room table. there is the off screen sound of a cretin slurping cheerios. reveal jerry reading sports illustrated, scratching his balls with one hand and shoveling in cereal with the other. estelle is washing dishes when she spies something out the window.}

<C>__{estelle}
<D>__{jerry, i don't understand. what happened to the chevy nova?}
