<A>__{brendan sits against the massive gym building, writing on a piece of looseleaf paper.}
<L>__{exterior administration building later}
<A>__{brendan slips the paper under a door stenciled "vp offices".}
<L>__{exterior basketball field later}
<A>__{cold, barren. wind whistles softly and jangles the metal mesh basketball nets like windchimes. brendan stands crookedly, hands in pockets, eyes trained on the cold black horizon. a speck appears. brendan waits for it, bracing himself against the wind. laura. she puts her arms around him, a warm embrace. brendan draws back.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{did you see it all? with tug and the pin?}
<A>__{brendan looks at her a moment.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{no. i took your advice and didn't go.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{what happened?}
<A>__{laura looks at him strangely, a little uneasy.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{the papers say six dead, three around the house, one girl in the trunk of tug's car, and the pin and tug.}
<A>__{brendan's face is frozen in an ambiguous frown.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{tug tried to shoot his way out when the police got there. they tied him to dode, too. same gun. and the girl.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{huh.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{well good thing you weren't there.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{laura's face softens a bit.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you think the girl was emily?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{probably.}
<A>__{laura embraces him again, and doesn't let go.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you loved her.}
<C>__{brendan}
<P>__{(distant)}
<D>__{yeah i did.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you did all this cause you loved her. and now it's finished.}
<P>__{(tightens her embrace)}
<D>__{i love you.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{laura pulls back, looks at his face. it is a mask.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{no, it's not finished. tug pulled the trigger on em and he got the fall, but the bulls coulda found that out without me.}
<A>__{laura pulls back more.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{i set out to know who put her in the spot, who put her in front of the gun. that was you, angel.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(drifting back further)}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{it was you. what, you want the whole tale? you want me to tell it to you?}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(bewildered)}
<D>__{tell it to me.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{alright, from the top. you had your fingers in brad bramish for appearances and to keep him buying from the pin, who you were hooked with. emily came to you and brad, you saw her for what she was, an insecure little girl trying to get in. she goes on the backburner. meanwhile maybe you're getting bored, maybe just greedy, so when the pin scores big with the bricks you take your shot. you hook one, take half, and cut it back to size, but you cut it bad. maybe accidentally, maybe to down the pin's operation, doesn't matter. you put it back, but poor frisco doses off it and lands in a coma.}
<P>__{(voice strengthening)}
<D>__{so now the pin's fuming, maybe he's jealous of brad, so he comes to brad's crowd looking for blood, or at least a scape. you know trouble. there's going to be a war over this. and there's emily. she trusts you. she wants in. it's duck soup.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(murmurs)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{you frame her for the bad brick, then you cut her loose. you turn on your heel and bite her in the throat. last week on the payphone, pico and alexander, she saw something she was scared of. tug's car driving by, the pin driving, but she wouldn't have seen the pin. no, she was across the street, angel. she saw the passenger side. she saw you. she saw you and ran like she saw some devil.}
<A>__{laura's face is very still, quivering.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{brendan, why are you }
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{and she took the hit. dode hid her away, but the pin was on to her, tracked her down, told her to meet him, that they would make good. gave her a time, and a place. and sent tug. just to get the straight. but maybe you had talked tug up, or maybe he just blew a fuse, but em sprung it on him that she had her kid, and he did what anyone could count on tug doing he hit her. she took the hit for you. you let her take it.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{stop it!}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{that's the tale.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{stop it!}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{you're going to tell me it's not?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{it's not!}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{look at me.}
<A>__{she crumples against him, looking him straight in the eye.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you know me. i've only helped you. how can you it isn't true!}
<A>__{she sobs through a tensed, straight face. brendan holds her stare, but his eyes are distant.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i hope it isn't. i want you to have been on my side all along, not just trying to get me under your thumb like brad and the pin and tug.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{but i think you knew that meeting was going to blow up. i think that was your final play. but i hope i'm wrong. i hope everything i wrote in the note i dropped at gary trueman's office this morning is wrong. about your and brad's involvement in the pin's runnings. i hope you didn't steal the brick last night. in your purse.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(breathes)}
<D>__{i didn't.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{that's good. that means you didn't let me walk into a slaughterhouse. you didn't lead tug and the pin and their crews to the slaughter. and when trueman reads the note, takes my cue and searches your locker, he won't find a damn thing.}
<A>__{something changes in laura's eyes.}
