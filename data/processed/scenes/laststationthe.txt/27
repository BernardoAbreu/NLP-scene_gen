<L>__{interior yasnaya polyana. sitting room. night.}
<A>__{sofya is settled on a divan in a small room off the dining room. valentin sits beside her holding a glass of tea.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{i see a fine young man before me. clear eyes. nice features, rather handsome in a peculiar way.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{thank you, countess...}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{call me sofya andreyevna. we don't stand on formality here, as you may have observed.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{many young men ruin their looks by loose living. you're a real tolstoyan, i can tell!}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{i admire your husband immensely.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{that's excellent. he likes that.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{his ideas are beautiful...social justice...the idea...don't you think?}
<A>__{sofya drains her tea cup, signals for more.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{he's very grateful for the help you've been giving him. he told me so himself. i think it surprises him that a young man would be so diligent. when he was your age, he was whoring in the caucasus.}
<A>__{valentin's eyes are wide. she nods.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{he wrote it all down. he even gave me a copy, so i could read all the details...}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{you've read war and peace?}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{many times... twice.}
<A>__{sofya smiles at his honesty.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{when he was writing it, long before chertkov created that monstrosity at telyatinki, before all this "new religion" and revolutionary nonsense...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what do you think of chertkov, by the way?}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{he's given me an extraordinary opportunity.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{but you see what a fool he is, a self serving puritanical idiot. i have to say, it's been extremely pleasant since they've locked him in his house.}
<A>__{sofya smiles. valentin is nonplussed by her directness.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{when my husband was writing it, in the mid sixties, he'd bring me pages to re copy everyday. i was the only one who could read his handwriting. i could read his intentions, too. afternoons, we'd drink tea and discuss changes. "natasha wouldn't say that to prince andrey," or "pierre's too simple here. he's not stupid."}
<A>__{she smiles at the memory.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{but i don't count anymore.}
<A>__{silence. she sips her tea. she glances out the door to see sasha hovering nearby. listening? sasha walks away.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{you must help me, valentin fedorovich. i want only what is best for my husband and my family. i could tolerate the situation if it only concerned me what i can not do is sit back while they steal my children's inheritance. do you know i was the only person. i could understand his intention.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{i don't believe anyone wants to do that.}
<A>__{sofya gives him a condescending smile. she produces a package from the table beside her, hands it to him.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{i have a little gift for you}
<A>__{he opens it, extracts a small leather bound book. he stares at it.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{it's a diary.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{everyone should always keep a diary.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{it's a very popular activity around your husband.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{you're teasing me, but i trust you'll write the truth.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{that may not be so easy.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{nonsense. you've been listening to your friends at telyatinki...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{write what you see. that's always the place to begin.}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{what. you. see.}
<A>__{valentin fingers the package, stifles a sneeze.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{more tea?}
