<L>__{exterior the sprawl night}
<A>__{the unzoned city is full of 1950's iconography, but it all feels different than it did in the suburbs. where the burbs were ike, the city is joseph mccarthy. the fat ramblers and studebakers have a little grime on them. the women's dresses are tighter and more urgent, the men's suits have some shine at the elbows. you look over your shoulder here, move faster, and smile a lot less. and some streets you don't go on at all. anderson's python moves down one of them. he stops under a blackened suspension bridge, gets out. he's still in uniform. he holds a duffel bag. he starts to walk away from the python, then hesitates. he's left the door open. he shakes his head at his sloppiness. goes back and shuts the door. walks away again.}

<A>__{he's left a small device on the passenger's seat. digital numbers shoot by in reverse. something clicks.}
<B>__{outside the car}
<A>__{anderson continues walking away. he doesn't look back as the python is engulfed in a miniature sun of heat and flame. it's not a gasoline powered vehicle so it doesn't explode. it just ceases to exist.}
