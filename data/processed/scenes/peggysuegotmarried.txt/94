<L>__{exterior gas station}
<A>__{michael pumps air into the tires, bunched against a building. peggy approaches him, holding up a joint, smiling conspiratorially. she lights it, inhales deeply, then passes it to him. he smiles back at her, a bit surprised, but still takes the joint and inhales.}
<L>__{exterior mountain road}
<A>__{they drive up to a mountain top, peggy wearing the leather jacket. she directs michael with one arm. the motorcycle is parked. peggy and michael lie on the grass, staring down at the town lights below. michael inhales the joint, then passes it to peggy.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{this is great reefer.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{yeah. i'm surprised. it's really old... (inhales) travels well though.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know, the world looks a lot better from up here.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the world is fantastic. it's the ultimate absurd circus. i am shot from a cannon into the energy.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{what are you shooting for?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{maximum intensity. yeah. i can't wait to get out of here. i'm gonna write. i'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. push myself away from the dinner table and say 'no more jello for me, mom.'}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{don't you get along with your parents?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the only thing my father digs is cold, green money. all my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{they care about you. they're just a different generation.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{hey what's with you? i thought you were cool. you rode my bike. you blew some pot.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what's your scene miss majorette? you gonna marry mr. blue impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{i already did that. i want to be a dancer, i want to dance.}
<A>__{peggy takes off her sweater, kicks off her shoes and begins to dance. her eyes are closed, her body silhouetted by the moon. michael is transfixed. after a few beats, he walks over to her. he stretches out his arms and places them around her neck. they sway together for several beats, their bodies touching. peggy opens her eyes and sees michael gazing at her tenderly.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you know, i had you pegged all wrong.}
<A>__{michael kisses peggy. she responds passionately.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{a ray of oneness piercing the solitude. falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. you'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{is that one of your poems?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no, i just made that up. do you want to hear one?}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{i'd love to.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(eyes ablaze)}
<D>__{okay. here's a new one. it's called tenderness.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i couldn't sleep so i thought i'd scream betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. in the madhouse of dr. dread razor shreds of rat puke fall on my bare arms}
<P>__{(sees peggy grimace; he calms down)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i guess i was trying to impress you.}
<P>__{(kisses her)}
<A>__{peggy is falling for it. he fumbles with her bra straps.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{michael... you're as good as you looked.}
<A>__{his other hand reaches to undo her skirt.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i will respect you for eternity.}
<P>__{(reciting tenderly)}
<D>__{'when you are old and gray, and full of sleep, and nodding by the fire, take down this book, and slowly read, and dream of the soft look your eyes had once."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i didn't write that. that's yeats.}
<A>__{peggy is moved by the beauty of the poem. she sits up, leans over michael, runs her hand through his hair, almost motherly.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{i envy you. you have your whole life ahead of you and you know exactly what you want to do.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but forget the rat puke; write something beautiful.}
<A>__{peggy lies back down on the ground. michael takes her hand and kisses it.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{you know, this isn't really happening.}
<A>__{camera pulls back to include the entire, perfect tableau: the starry night, the motorcycle, the clouds racing across the moon and the two lovers on the mountaintop.}
