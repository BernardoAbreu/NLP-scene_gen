<A>__{charlie's living room night lansky, siegel, costello, and luciano ponder their options.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{those fucks can't leave each other alone. maranzano and masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.}
<C>__{siegel}
<D>__{let 'em kill each other off! why should we care?}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{there won't be any way to stay out of it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i think maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.}
<C>__{siegel}
<D>__{sure, frankie. fuck me. fuck meyer. fuck arnold rothstein who's made us all rich. all so you can be an fuckin' honorary sicilian!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{does maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?}
<C>__{siegel}
<D>__{if he's gonna fuck me up the ass!}
<C>__{lansky}
<D>__{hey. calm down. they're crazy. we're not. let's use that. okay?}
<A>__{siegel and costello shrug a truce.}
<C>__{lansky}
<D>__{bugsy, you and i don't need to be in business with maranzano. we got more jobs than we can handle. that's not the problem.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{so what is the problem?}
<C>__{lansky}
<D>__{the minute we sell out to maranzano, that bastard is gonna have you knocked off.}
<A>__{a momentary silence falls over the group.}
<C>__{lansky}
<D>__{he's afraid of you, 'cause you're a sicilian. and maybe, someday, you're gonna want to be the boss of bosses. if he iced you now, there'd be a stink. but if you work for him, nobody's got a beef.}
<A>__{costello mulls the logic.}
<C>__{siegel}
<D>__{the deal's too good, frankie}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what are ya thinkin', charlie?}
