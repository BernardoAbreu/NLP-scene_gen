<C>__{rasczak}
<D>__{move to retrieval on my command ! first group, now...!}
<A>__{the circle shrinks as roughnecks fall back and board the boat. more and more bugs pile in over the compound walls.}
<C>__{rasczak}
<D>__{alright, flores ! levy ! rico...!}
<A>__{suddenly, the ground collapses under rasczak. he falls in to his waist, vomits blood as something chews on him from below.}

<A>__{johnny blows the bug off her back. blood sprays from a deep gash in her neck. johnny picks her up, tries to stop the blood with his hand. the life is leaving her eyes.}
