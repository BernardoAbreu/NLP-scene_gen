<L>__{exterior street}
<A>__{white paces nervously through empty streets. he stops, to get his bearings, then turns and runs into: a silhouetted figure in a bizarre metal contraption on wheels. a skeletal hand reaches out to white, grabs his arm. an inhuman moan. terrorised, white pulls back.}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{ahhh... it hurts!...}
<A>__{the mechanized figure trundles forward, pins him to a wall. a streetlight reveals... doctor schreber covered in blood, encased in a metal framework covered in silver blades.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{what happened to you?}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{i'm... being... punished.}
<A>__{the blades are connected to the wheels they turn when he moves forward, metal cuts into his flesh, slowly skinning him alive. a torture machine. between screams of intense pain, the doctor speaks.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{i had to ahhhh find you... i... i...}
<A>__{the doctor shuts his eyes, a trickle of blood runs down his face.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{we are... living in their dreams...}
<A>__{schreber turns and rolls off into the night, screaming blades spin furiously, peeling back flesh. he glances at white one last time.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{insect... dreams...}
