<L>__{interior kennel night}
<A>__{most of the dogs are sleeping or lounging. the new dog watches them calmly, silently. he takes several steps towards a group of about five dogs and sits upright. completely still. he stares at them. a beat. the dogs are aware of something. they begin to seem a bit confused, uncomfortable. the new dog continues to stare. sitting rigidly, unnaturally still. his eyes dead, lusterless black spheres. bewildered, a few dogs start to pace. as if sensing something: a portent. a danger. but so odd. they begin a soft, purring growl. the new dog remains a statue. the growling builds. more dogs begin to pace. nervously. faster, encircling. emitting hisses, snarls. the lack of response driving them into a frenzy. barks. growls. more frenetic pacing. the din escalating. three dogs start to close in on the stranger. they attack.}
<B>__{the shadow of the new dog}
<A>__{against the kennel wall. the shadow suddenly lurches upward, seeming larger. the kennel roars.}
