<L>__{exterior long island beach. day.}
<A>__{truman runs down the beach towards the cliff he attempted to scale as a seven year old boy.}
<L>__{exterior clifftop. day.}
<A>__{truman sits on the clifftop, staring out at the view his father had been so desperate for him not to see twenty seven years earlier. however the deserted bay beyond is exactly as his father described almost identical to its neighbor. marlon, laboring, crests the rise and joins his friend on the clifftop.}
<C>__{marlon}
<D>__{what're we doing here, truman?}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{this is where it started.}
<C>__{marlon}
<D>__{where what started?}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{things. things that don't fit. loose threads. false steps. slips of the tongue.}
<C>__{marlon}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{make sense, truman. you going religious on me?}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(tears of bitterness welling in his eyes)}
<D>__{my father didn't want me to see what was over here. whatever it was, it's gone now. i never shoulda listened to him that day. i knew it was wrong.}
<A>__{we see a quick flashback of seven year old truman on the cliff face twenty seven years earlier.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{there were a hundred people on the beach that day. everybody knew what was going on except me.}
<C>__{marlon}
<D>__{i don't want to put you down but why would anybody go to all this trouble over you?}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{maybe i've been mistaken for somebody else.}
<P>__{(a memory triggered)}
<D>__{a couple of years ago, i tried to get hold of a copy of time magazine. the week before an ad said, "next week: truman burbank and the lost generation".}
<A>__{marlon shrugs, unimpressed.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{a guy with the same name as me in time magazine. it ain't a common name so i looked out for it. but the day it came out, every newstand was sold out. no library had it. i even wrote off for a back issue. never seen a copy to this day.}
<A>__{marlon remains unconvinced.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{maybe i'm being set up for something. you ever feel like that, marlon? like your whole life has been building to something?}
<A>__{marlon looks skeptically at truman. he hasn't had that feeling.}
<C>__{marlon}
<P>__{(becoming testy)}
<D>__{a coincidence. haven't you ever heard of a coincidence?}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{i'm a walking coincidence. i can't count 'em. no something's happening, marlon. i've got to get to the bottom of it.}
<C>__{marlon}
<P>__{(shaking his head in exasperation)}
<D>__{of what?!}
<A>__{why're you doing this to yourself?}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{i'm scared, marlon. i'm as scared as hell. but i've never felt more alive. it's just like she said.}
<C>__{marlon}
<P>__{(suddenly intrigued)}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{it doesn't matter. she was too beautiful for here.}
<A>__{now marlon is really confused.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{can you lend me some money? a hundred bucks.}
<C>__{marlon}
<D>__{all i got on me is the takings from the machines. why do you need it?}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{i'm going away for a while.}
