<L>__{interior vito's log cabin night.}
<A>__{steve kovack performs an exhausting, sweat drenched drum solo. april and shep now sit alone in the booth.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{i'm sorry you're not going away anymore. i know it was important to you.}
<A>__{april distantly nods her thanks.}
<C>__{shep }
<D>__{don't take this wrong; i've been there and...they don't have so much we don't have here.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{it didn't have to be paris.}
<A>__{shep sips his beer, trying to figure out how to connect with her...}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{you just wanted out, huh?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{i wanted in. i just wanted us to live again.}
<A>__{shep nods, not entirely sure what she means.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{for years i thought we shared a secret...that we would be wonderful in the world. i didn't exactly know how, but just the possibility...kept me hoping.}
<A>__{she takes a long slug of her drink.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{how pathetic is that? to put all your hopes in a promise that was never made? see, frank knows...he knows what he wants. he's found his place. he's just fine. married, two kids. it should be enough. it is for him. he's right; we were never special or destined or anything at all.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{sure you are. you're the wheelers. you're a terrific couple, everyone says so.}
<A>__{april doesn't hear, she's pursuing her thought...}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{i saw a different life. i can't stop seeing it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{can't leave, can't stay.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no damn use to anyone.}
<A>__{april turns and stares at him. the band strikes up a new number.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{come on, let's do it.}
