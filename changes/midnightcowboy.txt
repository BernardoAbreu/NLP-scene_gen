Then Joe leans back, frowning, thoughtful. We still do not see Ratso's face. Joe rises slowly, starting forward in the bus... ... passing an older couple, a schoolgirl, two ladies with straw hats, a young man trying to read, pausing when he reaches... ... the DRIVER, staring out at the Sunshine Parkway with the Driver, leaning over so he won't have to speak too loudly.}
