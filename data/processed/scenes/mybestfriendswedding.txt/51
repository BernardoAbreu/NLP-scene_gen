<L>__{exterior tennis court day}
<A>__{the court has become a giant holding pen for tonight's balloons. there are maybe a billion in assorted colors already blowing in all directions, under clear plastic sheeting which has ben spread across the top of the court's chain link fence. michael stands outside the court, clutching the chain link like a prisoner, as julianne comes through the gate. from somewhere, we hear high, squeaky, alien voice like sounds. incongruous against...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{how is she?}
<A>__{julianne absorbs this. as the bizarre sounds continue, she whirls around...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{knock it off!!!}
<A>__{we now see three stoner college guys, who have been filling the endless array of balloons from helium tanks at center court. clearly, they've been inhaling their working materials.}
<C>__{stoner kid}
<P>__{(minnie mouse)}
<D>__{yes, sir!}
<A>__{a nazi salute. when she turns back...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i asked you...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{she admits it's her fault.}
<A>__{he absorbs that. and then...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{do you think she still loves me?}
<A>__{we watch the struggle inside her. her voice drops...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{sure, she does. she's crazy about you.}
<A>__{now tears stand in both their eyes. the stoners are doing their alvin and the chipmuks impersonation festival in the b.g., singing in castrato harmony. but our two don't notice.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i keep asking, how can i explain what happened? and i keep getting that same answer all night long.}
<A>__{which is...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i can't. and it doesn't matter. i drove her to it, because i want things my way. and even if she did something tricky and unfair... she was blinded by love, okay?}
<A>__{julianne swallows. for obvious reasons.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{does that make it right...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{love doesn't have to be right. it just has to be love.}
<A>__{the stoner are now helium crooning "bridge over troubled waters." actually, they're getting better.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{she's giving up half her life for me, and i'm bitching because it hurts her.}
<C>__{stoners}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{sail on silver girl sail on by...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{she's a saint! and i'm a worthless ingrate!}
<C>__{stoners}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{your time has come to shine, all your dreams are on their way...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{tell her. i will marry her at six o'clock, if she'll still have me.}
<A>__{the stoners blend on the high note. it's pretty moving.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i will be right back.}
