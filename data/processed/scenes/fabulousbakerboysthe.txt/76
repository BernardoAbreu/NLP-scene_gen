<L>__{interior hotel corridor day}
<A>__{the next morning. frank, the early bird, is returning to the room with a newspaper under his arm. whistling happily, he rounds the corner just in time to see a man exit susie's room. astonished, then outraged, he goes to susie's door and knocks sharply.}

<C>__{susie}
<D>__{uh ...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{in case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here. so it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{decency? hey listen, pal ...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no. you listen. i had my doubts about you from the beginning}

<C>__{frank}
<D>__{how come i didn't hear anything?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're a heavy sleeper, frank. you've always been a heavy sleeper.}

<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hey, business is business.}
<A>__{he turns to leave. susie's eyes narrow.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{it wasn't business. it was pleasure.}
