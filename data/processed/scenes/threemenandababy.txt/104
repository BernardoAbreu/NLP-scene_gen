<L>__{interior kitchen late afternoon}
<A>__{michael and jack are sitting at the table.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(looking at his watch)}
<D>__{what did i tell you? ten minutes to the second!}
<L>__{interior apartment evening}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{okay, listen, you guys... i've tried everything and nothing's working: my mother's off on a cruise; mrs. razzolini won't speak to us ever since the whole business with the cops we don't want to involve any of our girlfriends; sylvia's taking it easy in europe and there's no way she's gonna come back now that michael went and told her everything's just fine and dandy. peter did a terrific job getting rid of mrs. bretsaws, and all that's left are the daycare centers, but peter's positive they're a breeding pit for a.i.d.s. so you tell me: what are we suppose to do? you want me to split with the kid? or dump her in an orphanage?}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(pretending to play the violin)}
<D>__{here we go.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{look, her mother'll be back in less than five months. let's not waste a shitload of time looking for a solution for such a short time. let's get organized.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what do you mean, organized?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well, you'll have to ask to fly the new york washington shuttle for five months, on account of serious personal problems.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what? never! i'd rather be a subway conductor.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(barking)}
<D>__{then dump her in an orphanage, 'cause there's no way we're gonna take care of her all by ourselves anymore!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{come on, stop arguing, you two! jack, you're going to have to ask to do the new york washington shu...}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(stubborn, yelling)}
<D>__{no! never.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(unruffled)}
<D>__{that way, you can do the 6 10 a.m. shift. that amounts to two bottles and two diaper changes. you do the shopping when you get home in the evening and that's all. peter, you'll take the 6 10 p.m. shift. that's two bottles and two diaper changes, her bath and her laundry. since i work at home i will take the longest shift from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. i will take her to the park for an hour, but that's it. no shopping, no cooking, no cleaning.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what if she gets up at night? whose shift is that?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{well... i thought you might do it...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{not a chance! i'm not doing the night shift. i absolutely refuse. i have too much work to catch up on for the competition.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, needless to say i refuse, too!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{listen to me, you selfish bastards! my shift is eight hours in a row. no way i'm gonna do nights too. after 6 p.m. she can scream all she wants, i don't give a shit.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you know, jack, you're a real slime ball! we give you the easiest shift: the morning. she's always in great shape in the morning, isn't she? we've got to work like crazy to save our jobs and you have the nerve to refuse nights. goddamit, she's your daughter. are you that horny?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(extremely pissed off)}
<D>__{hey, horny yourself! i don't give a shit. i don't need you guys. i will find some other way to do it. and i won't take the new york washington shuttle!}
<A>__{he exits, furious.}
