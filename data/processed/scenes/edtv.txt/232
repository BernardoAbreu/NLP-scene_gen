<L>__{interior network conference room day}
<A>__{ed is there along with cynthia and the network execs. there are more execs than before. cynthia's people are not there. this entire meeting is on ed tv. cynthia is quiet observing. ed looks whipped.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{three more months?}
<C>__{mr. scharlach}
<D>__{absolutely! ed tv is more popular than ever. congratulations. mcilvaine only, ed, we want you, in the next few weeks to spend a lot more time with your family.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{you do?}
<C>__{seaver}
<D>__{definitely. cynthia, explain it to him.}
<A>__{cynthia just stares at her, coldly.}
<C>__{seaver }
<D>__{i'11 do it.}
<P>__{(to ed)}
<D>__{people want to see what happens to them now. do your mother and step father get back together? how does your sister handle being alone? your feud with your brother.}
<C>__{scharlach}
<D>__{in fact, we have a new concept. since your family signed releases, we can follow them on camera even when you're not with them. we can cut around from family member to family member. whoever's the most exciting at that moment. mcilvaine and, of course, it's another big bonus payment for you.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{a couple of years ago my uncle roy got bit on the ass by a dog.}
<A>__{silence. what the hell is he talking about?}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{so he gave me his tickets to the u.s. open the tennis matches.}
<A>__{they still have no idea what he's talking about.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{so me and ray, we tell our friends "watch when andre agassi is gonna serve for the first time. when he's bouncing the ball and it's real quiet, we'11 yell "whoop". and you'11 all hear us."}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{scharlach}
<D>__{i see.}
<P>__{(he doesn't)}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{you know what that is? it's sad. i mean it was just so we could be heard. so we could stand out from the crowd for a second. so we did it. but we had nothing to say. just "whoop". that's it. and the stupid part i mean the really stupid part is we thought it like... elevated us above the crowd. where the fact is it made us stupider than the crowd.}
<C>__{scharlach}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{stop saying "i see." you don't see. cynthia, i owe you an apology.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{yeah. because, you didn't talk me into anything. everything you wanted me to do, i wanted to do.}
