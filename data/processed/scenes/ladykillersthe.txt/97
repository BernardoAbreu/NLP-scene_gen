<A>__{mrs. munson is looking at the cellar door. dust drifts out from under it. she takes a slow step towards it. another step. she opens the door. there is no visibility in the cellar due to swirling clay dust. she takes one step down the stairs, waving at the air in front of her face. paper money wafts in and out of the dust. we hear voices:}
<C>__{pancake }
<D>__{perfectly all right. not a problem.}
<C>__{lump }
<D>__{well there sure as shit ain't no tunnel left.}
<A>__{the clearing dust reveals the caped professor anxiously dancing from foot to foot, gathering money out of the air. as he reaches up to grab a bill that has him facing up in mrs. munson's direction, he freezes. his pov reveals her through dissipating dust.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{professor, i'm surprised.}
<A>__{there is a long beat, through which all stare at her.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...properly speaking, madam, we have been surprised; you are taken aback. though i acknowledge that the sense you intend is gaining currency through increasing use.}
<A>__{further dissipation of the dust reveals how much money there is, settling now to cover the floor of the cellar.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...you have returned from your devotions betimes.}
