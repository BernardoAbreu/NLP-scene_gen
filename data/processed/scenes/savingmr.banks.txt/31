<L>__{interior disney's office day}
<A>__{disney's office is tastefully furnished and filled with pictures of his daughters and wife. framed posters of his films provide splashes of color to the cream walls.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{have a seat, sit down.}
<A>__{he gestures to a comfy couch in the corner but pamela takes a seat in front of walt's desk instead, glancing at the sign above it: we can make them live. walt perches on the edge of the desk, close to her, gazing at her.}
<C>__{walt }
<D>__{ya know, i can't believe it. p.l. travers, right here, in my office, after all these years almost twenty of `em.}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}

<C>__{walt }
<D>__{but now, here you are. look at you! i could eat you up!}
<C>__{pamela}

<D>__{she's a doll. anyways i asked them "girls, what's so funny?" and diane said to me, "mary poppins daddy!" well, i had no idea what a mary poppins was! and then she gave me your book. and by gosh!}
<A>__{he stands up and throws his arms in the air to emphasise his pointerior}
<C>__{walt }
<D>__{my imagination was caught on fire! and i mean on fire! and those embers have burned ever since as you know.}
<C>__{pamela walt}

<C>__{pamela walt}
<A>__{yes. twenty. so you keep i've been asking, asking,}

<C>__{walt }
<D>__{i got old asking.}
<A>__{he sits back down on his desk.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{what a charming story.}

<D>__{about your daughters.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{yeah i suppose it is.}
<P>__{(he looks at the picture)}
<D>__{they're both women now. gosh! can you believe it?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{children grow up.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{now pam, a man can't break a promise to his kids. no matter how long it takes to keep. no matter how long! you might've kept me dangling all this time but now we gotcha!}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{gotcha indeed! mister disney, if you have dangled then it is at the end of a rope you have fashioned for yourself.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{pamela }
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{i was quite clear when you approached me the first time that she wasn't for sale and clear again when you approached me a year later and clear again when you approached me every annum for the subsequent 18 years. honestly, i feel corralled, ensnared }
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{pam, pam, the last thing i want is to make you feel }
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{my name, if you please, is mrs travers.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{you see, i promised them. that's a fact. you got kids?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{not }
<C>__{walt}
<P>__{(over)}
<D>__{i have never, i swear, never broken a promise to either one of my disney girls.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{well, that's very honourable of you but }
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{that's what being a daddy is all about right?}
<C>__{pamela}
<P>__{(deep breath)}
<D>__{is it?}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{this movie isn't just going to make my kids happy. it's going to make all kids happy! you see my guys are gonna do things with it that are, well, are revolutionary.}
<A>__{he's up again.}
<C>__{walt }
<D>__{revolutionary,pam!}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{oh dear }
<A>__{pamela rubs her temples as she watches him fly about the room.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{mary poppins will literally fly off the pages of your books!}
<A>__{the door opens and tommie comes in with the tea, walt gestures for her to bring it to him.}
<C>__{walt }
<D>__{now imagine! this magical woman who has only lived in your head, you'll be able to meet her, speak to her, hear her sing.}
<A>__{tommie places the tray on walt's desk and leaves the room. walt picks up the tea pot.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{yes, this singing, i am glad you've come to that.}
<P>__{(addressing his tea making)}
<D>__{milk first!}
<A>__{walt puts the pot down immediately like a scolded child and picks up the milk jug, he pours.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{that's right. now the tea }
<A>__{he picks up the pot again and pours the tea.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{and a spoonful of sugar.}
<A>__{he stirs.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{you don't mean for this film to be a musical?}
<C>__{walt}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{i absolutely do!}
<A>__{he presents her with the cup.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she takes a sip, he waits anxiously to see if his tea is any good.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{not bad. no, mister disney, mary poppins does not sing.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{oh yes she does!}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{in your books!}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{those aren't songs! they're recitations. she is not a giddy woman, she does not jig! singing is frivolous and wholly unnecessary for a governess, an educatress. no. it would just ruin it.}
<A>__{walt is baffled. he takes a sip of tea, it's disgusting, he spits it back into his cup surreptitiously, then coughs loudly. pamela's jaw drops.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{i won't have her turned into one of your silly cartoons.}
<A>__{walt takes a sharp breath on `silly' and then plasters the smile back on.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{tell ya what. you just listen to what my sherman boys have come up with and if they don't knock your socks off then i'm the king of england.}
<A>__{pamela rolls her eyes.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{if you're the king of england then you shan't exist and knowing the little of you i do; i shouldn't think you would like that very much.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{bet you would.}
<A>__{she smirks, as does he.}
<C>__{pamela}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i do quite like greensleeves.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{greensleeves huh?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{come to think of it. that's a song i wouldn't object to.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{greensleeves.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{he's not sure if she's playing with him.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{pam, i want you to know that the last thing i would do, the very last thing, is tarnish a story i have cherished.}
<A>__{he moves closer to her, takes her hand, she needs it for her teacup, it's awkward.}
<C>__{walt }
<P>__{(gazing into her eyes)}
<D>__{the pages are worn down to tissue, dog eared and falling out. i have poured over them gripped, tormented. because i love mary poppins, you got to share her with me.}
<A>__{pamela is torn between finding disney captivating and totally barking.}
<C>__{walt }
<D>__{a course nothing happens without your say so. absolutely nothing.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{quite right.}
<A>__{she extricates her hand.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{it's all in the rights agreement. as approved by your agent, dermot.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{diarmuid.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{darmitt.}
<A>__{disney hands the rights agreement and a pen to her, pamela takes it without looking and folds it up.}
<C>__{pamela}
<P>__{(waving the agreement)}
<D>__{a live action film. no animation.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{live action.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{i'd like that on tape.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{hm?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{your promise and all the discussions we have here on tape.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{tape you say.}
<A>__{she pops the rights document in her bag. walt's joviality, his bright demeanour, vanishes in a split second.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{ah there you are.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{mary poppins and the banks's, they're family to me.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{i understand. i do.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{well then!}
<A>__{she stands up and smooths down her skirt.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{shall we begin?}
<A>__{he holds out his hand for her to shake.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{let's make something wonderful.}
<A>__{she leaves his hand hanging in mid air.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{let's see if that's at all possible.}
<A>__{pamela gets up, smooths down her skirt, snorts at a picture of disney in a silly hat astride a model train and purposefully strides out of the room, a smile across her face that disney does not see.}
<C>__{walt}
<P>__{(perplexed)}
<D>__{woah.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{damn.}
