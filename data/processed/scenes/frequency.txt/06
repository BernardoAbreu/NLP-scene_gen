<L>__{exterior manhole canal & bowery continuous}
<A>__{frank uses the "adz" to rip open the heavy manhole cover.}
<L>__{interior manhole tunnel continuous}
<A>__{frank and gibson descend into the tunnel, strap lights on their leather helmets to illuminate the damp darkness. they race down the subterranean passage. the stench is thick. butch's voice suddenly booms out of the walkie talkie:}
<C>__{butch}
<P>__{(via walkie)}
<D>__{frank, you hear me? frank?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(into walkie)}
<D>__{yeah, butch?}
<C>__{butch}
<P>__{(via walkie)}
<D>__{the gas level is getting serious. the underground's combustible it could flashover. i want you to abort! now! get the hell out of there!}
<A>__{frank picks up the pace. charges ahead. guy's got balls.}
<C>__{gibson}
<P>__{(into walkie)}
<D>__{frank. we gotta go back. frank...}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(calling back to him)}
<D>__{stay with me, gib. we're gonna do this.}
<C>__{gibson}
<P>__{(charging after him)}
<D>__{i should'a been a fucking mailman.}
<A>__{frank reaches the rusted 'submarine like' vault door. pounds on the door... a faint response. he goes to work on it with the halaghan tool. gibson arrives...pretty rattled. frank gives him a wink and a smile. it's gonna be okay.}
<C>__{butch}
<P>__{(via walkie)}
<D>__{frank, where are you?}
<A>__{frank digs down, suddenly the door gives way oil and water rush from the vault, pouring over frank and gibson, foaming into the tunnel. but the door is mounted three feet off the ground. there is still three feet of oil and water trapped inside. and the smell of gas is now overwhelming...}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(into walkie)}
<D>__{we're in, butch.}
<A>__{frank probes the dark vault with the flashlight blade. through smoke we see two men huddled in the corner, trapped by three loose 'hot' cables whipping around the tiny vault like an electric hydra. con ed worker #2 shivers, ankle broken, leaning on older con ed worker #1.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{time to go home, fellas.}
<A>__{gibson sprays the room, clearing out most of the smoke. frank steps into the vault.}
<D>__{con ed worker #1 careful. if the hot end of those cables hits you, it'll conduct to the water and we're all fired.}
<A>__{frank drops to his knees, ducking under the cables, shuffles to center of the vault. places his hands at opposite ends of the halaghan tool, hoping for the cables to pass directly over his head. a hairy beat, then... frank jackknifes out of the water, ramming the halaghan into the ceiling. it worked. the teeth on the "claw end" and the spike on the "adz end" are embedded into the concrete stapling the cables to the ceiling. make that balls of steel.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{go, gibby! everybody move it.}
<A>__{gibson and con ed worker #1 help injured worker #2 out of the vault. frank checks to make sure they've cleared the vault and lets go of the tool. frank jumps into the tunnel, hoists the injured worker over his back and races back down the tunnel.}
<C>__{frank }
<P>__{(to gibson)}
<D>__{haul ass, that claw ain't gonna hold for long...}
<P>__{(into walkie)}
<D>__{take cover she's gonna flash!}
