<A>__{she wanders up the drive, onto pg&e property, moving around the plant, taking pictures of it from every possible angle. as she wanders over a big, flat, dry field to the side of the plant, she glances over her shoulder to check on her kids and notices the trail she made in the dirt has a greenish hue. she looks at the dirt right her feet. kicks the ground. below the surface, the dirt turns from brown to green. erin notes this, then looks back at her kids playing in the dirt. worry comes over her face. she heads back to them.}
