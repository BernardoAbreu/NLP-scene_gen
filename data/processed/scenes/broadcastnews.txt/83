<A>__{he puts his hand behind her neck in an awkward gesture of camaraderie. she awkwardly disengages... waves and steps inside the door to the restaurant... standing there between the two sets of doors watching tom and jennifer walk away.}
<B>__{on tom and jennifer}
<A>__{as they walk to his car, first exchanging a look of reflection over jane... then bumping accidentally, then bumping back, a look, then kissing with passion, wrapped around each other.}
