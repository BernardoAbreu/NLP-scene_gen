<L>__{interior amtrak train day}
<A>__{linus takes us back to danny. the train hurtles onward.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{absolute bedlam}
<A>__{reuben, yen, the malloys, frank, livingston, saul, basher, and linus are all talking at once right at us. right at danny. and they are not happy. the group is in an abandoned warehouse somewhere near nyc. danny is overwhelmed, like a deer caught in the headlights. he throws a desperate glance at rusty, who's looking out the window serenely, letting danny flounder.}
<B>__{moments later}
<A>__{total silence. everyone just stares at danny, waiting for an answer.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{how many can't make the deadline?}
<A>__{everyone raises their hands except reuben.}
<C>__{reuben}
<P>__{(off their looks)}
<D>__{so i'm smarter than those schmucks on wall street. whose fault is that?}
<A>__{fair enough.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{how many think if they run, they'll be found?}
<A>__{everyone raises their hands. including reuben. danny gets up, walks over to rusty. the rest of the guys shrug and begin talking amongst themselves. after a long beat.}
<C>__{danny }
<D>__{well, the only other }
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{we're on the five o'clock.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{danny }
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{amsterdam.}
<A>__{danny steps back.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{amsterdam!?}
<A>__{danny's tone draws everyone's attention. noticing this, danny and rusty move into a nearby dilapidated office doorway. the guys go back to talking, mostly about what they were doing when they were found. this rises steadily in volume until the din is obliterated by a loud voice:}
<C>__{danny }
<D>__{i'm telling you this is a death sentence!}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{fine, then stay here!}
<A>__{the guys exchange glances. danny walks over to them and sighs.}
