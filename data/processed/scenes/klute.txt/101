<L>__{exterior window cable's office day}
<A>__{the camera pulls back from a cu of cable standing at the window to a wide angle looking at cable through the window. the window is 30 or 40 stories high. the wide angle lens almost makes the building look like it is standing on point, and cable, a man suspended in space.}
<L>__{exterior wide shot: docks day}
<A>__{a tugboat has pulled in. the sound of its heavy engines, idling, runs underneath this entire sequence. a police vehicle or two has parked at the head of the dock. we see several figures on the rear deck of the tug, but it's not clear at this distance what they're doing. the police car with klute arrives. he dismounts and proceeds from dock to tug deck.}
