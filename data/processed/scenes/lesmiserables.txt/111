<A>__{valjean walks the streets, not caring where he goes, struggling with his tormented thoughts. he sees a barricade being dismantled. and bodies. suddenly he knows what he's going to do. he sees a dead soldier. he takes his jacket and swiftly pulls it on. he continues on his way in the dark. looking up he sees that he's been walking all the time towards the very barricade where marius waits. now looking like a soldier, he passes unchallenged through their lines, and into the shadows. as he passes, he notices two soldiers climbing up onto the rooftops.}
