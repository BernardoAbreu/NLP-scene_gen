<L>__{interior squirrel hill productions rachel's office day}
<A>__{the office is filled with congratulatory balloons and flowers heralding the morning's news. spector's secretary is taking congratulatory phone messages at a desk in the b.g. two assistants are struggling in through the door with a large basketed floral arrangement. spector confronts frank across his desk.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{put together a list of your expenses. your total billing... let me have it in one hour and i will see that a check is cut.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{don't you ever say what's on your mind?}
<A>__{spector cannot believe he's being so addressed especially in front the staff. the assistants stop in their tracks and look.}
<C>__{spector}
<P>__{(almost shouts)}
<D>__{what's on my mind is that you're fired, frank. she missed all her interviews yesterday because of your little date. do you realize she stood up barbara walters? first you fuck up her career...}
<A>__{behind spector, out of his line of sight, rachel and devaney appear in the doorway with more cards. they also stop and listen.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{... and now you're fucking with her head.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's between us.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{you think so? you forget who signs your check. you don't understand the role i play around here.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no. i understand.}
<A>__{spector stiffens, then decides not to take this one on.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{get your shit together and be out of here by noon.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{frank stays.}
<A>__{spector looks round, sees that devaney and rachel have been listening. rachel is silent. with a curt nod of his head, spector gestures to the assistants to leave the room. devaney weighs in.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{with this high a profile, rachel needs protection now more than ever. if he goes, you can forget miami...}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{she's signed the fucking contract, bill. you want me to read it to you?}
<A>__{rachel is watching them both.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{fuck the contract. if he goes, she's not singing a note. it's too dangerous.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{oh. 'fuck the contract.' great. why don't you let rachel speak for herself? i think she has some say in this.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{frank stays.}
<A>__{spector considers her for a beat, then looks at the others. the secretary interrupts from the back of the office.}
<C>__{secretary }
<D>__{mr. schiller calling on line one...}
<A>__{spector ignores her, still holding his look at devaney, rachel and frank.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{well, i guess this is democracy in action.}
<A>__{rachel nods. spector, turning to take the call, flashes her a "little boy" look.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{i gave in. that's not easy for me. don't i get a hug?}
<A>__{rachel is stone faced. spector covers by picking up the phone.}
<C>__{spector}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{yeah?... sure, put him on... ben how are you?... uh huh...}
<A>__{frank and rachel look at each other in silence.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{...the ambassador? what the hell are you trying to pull, ben? rachel always gets the presidential... i don't care what you thought...}
<A>__{devaney leans to frank as spector's conversation continues in the b.g.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{do you know the fontainebleau hotel in miami beach?}
<A>__{frank nods.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{how does the ambassador suite compare to the presidential for us?}
<A>__{frank thinks only for a moment.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's on the twentieth floor in the south wing. there's a service elevator right there. mainly ocean windows. should be no problem.}
<C>__{spector}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{... i'm aware of that, ben, but let me just remind you people that you invited us...}
<A>__{frank turns toward the door.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(to frank)}
<D>__{hang around, farmer. we might need your vaunted expertise.}
<A>__{she reaches forward and hits a button on spector's desk, throwing the call onto a speaker.}
<C>__{rachel}

<D>__{hello, ben honey.}
<C>__{schiller }
<D>__{rachel, congratulations, you must be thrilled at the...}
