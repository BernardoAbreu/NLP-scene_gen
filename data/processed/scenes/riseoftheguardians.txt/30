<P>__{(to another fairy)}
<D>__{walla walla, washington. we've got a trampoline mishap at 1340 ginger lane.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{quiet.}
<A>__{he then looks up to see north and sandman looking down at him. the tooth fairy is surrounded by a dozen hovering tiny fairies who come and go as she blurts out orders.}
<C>__{t0oth }
<D>__{canine, lateral and central incisor. ouch! guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 31.}
<A>__{north clears his throat. they all turn to a bewildered jack.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{hey, there he is! jack frost!}
<A>__{as north holds out his arms to welcome jack, a dreamsand snowflake appears above sandy's head.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{wow, you gotta be kidding me.}
<A>__{two yetis suddenly grab jack by the shoulders and lift him up onto his feet.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hey, hey. whoa, put me down.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{i hope the yetis treated you well?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, yeah. i love being shoved in a sack and tossed through a magic portal.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{oh, good! that was my idea! you know bunny, obviously.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{obviously.}
<A>__{bunny stands off to the side, grumbling with his arms crossed. jack suddenly notices the mini tooth fairies hovering near him, staring and twittering.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{and the tooth fairy?}
<A>__{before jack can answer, she's gliding toward him.}
<C>__{tooth}
<D>__{hello, jack. i've heard a lot about you. and your teeth.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{my, my what?}
<C>__{tooth}
<P>__{(moves in way too close)}
<D>__{open up! are they really as white as they say? yes!}
<P>__{(gasp)}
<D>__{guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 32.}
<C>__{tooth }
<D>__{oh, they really do sparkle like freshly fallen snow.}
<A>__{several swooning mini teeth flutter around a confused jack, batting their lashes and screaming like crazed beatles fans. tooth collects herself, and...}
<C>__{tooth}
<D>__{girls, pull yourselves together... let's not disgrace the uniform.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{and sandman.}
<P>__{(sees sandy is snoozing)}
<D>__{sandy! sandy! wake up!}
<A>__{sandy bolts up awake and steps up to jack, smiling.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hey! ho! anyone wanna tell me why i'm here?}
<A>__{the wisp of dreamsand above sandy's head morphs into a}
<B>__{barrage of images.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that's not really helping. but thanks, little man.}
<P>__{(to others)}
<D>__{i musta done something really bad to get you four together.}
<A>__{jack walks away from the group, frosting an elf with a tray of cookies as it marches past, then turns around.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{am i on the naughty list?}
<C>__{north}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{on naughty list? you hold record! but no matter. we overlook. now we are wiping clean the slate.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how come?}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<P>__{(more to north)}
<D>__{ah, good question.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{how come? i tell you how come! because now...you are guardian! guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 33.}
<A>__{off jack's confusion, yetis light ceremonial torches with a whoosh. elves leap from columns, unfurling homemade, celebratory banners as they descend. jack brushes off a few baby teeth who try to present him with a necklace made of paper snowflakes.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what are you doing! get, get that offa me!}
<A>__{jack's voice is drowned out by the sounds of horns and drums.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{this is the best part!}
<A>__{an elf marching band strikes up, marching into the room. two yetis move jack on to a designated spot on the floor. jack looks down to find an elf pointing at his bare feet. the elf then directs his attention to two approaching elves, carrying a pair of ceremonial boots. jack's confusion escalates.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{a yeti hands north an old large book. north blows off the dust, opens it, and begins clearing his throat. jack clenches his jaw as he scans the room: the mini teeth continue to fawn, sandy's smiling, bunny's apathetic, and north looks on with pride. jack suddenly slams his staff down, sending a blast of frost and wind across the room. the torches go out and everything stops.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what makes you think i want to be a guardian?}
<A>__{north bursts out in laughter holding the book in his hands then stops and looks to jack, stone faced.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{of course you do!}
<P>__{(to the elves)}
<D>__{music!}
<A>__{the elves blare the trumpets again. celebration!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no music! guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 34.}
<A>__{the music peters out again. an elf throws his trumpet to the ground and storms off. north, displeased, glowers.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{look, this is all very flattering, but ah...you don't want me. you're all hard work and deadlines, and i'm snowballs and fun times. i'm not a guardian.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{yeah, that's exactly what i said!}
<C>__{tooth}
<D>__{jack...i don't think you understand what it is we do.}
<A>__{tooth swoops in and turns jack's attention to the massive globe behind him.}
<C>__{tooth}
<D>__{each of those lights is a child.}
<A>__{jack looks up at the globe, taking in the enormity of this. north suddenly moves to jack's side.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{a child who believes. and good or bad, naughty or nice, we protect them.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{tooth...fingers out of mouth.}
<A>__{we cut back to discover that tooth is examining jack's teeth.}
<C>__{tooth}
<P>__{(removes fingers)}
<D>__{oh, sorry. they're beautiful.}
<A>__{jack moves away from the globe and back toward the center of the room.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{okay, no more wishy washy! pitch is out there doing who knows what!}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(scoffs)}
<D>__{you mean the boogeyman?}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{yes! when pitch threatens us, he threatens them as well. guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 35.}
<A>__{north points to the lights on the globe.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{all the more reason to pick someone more qualified!}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{pick? you think we pick? no, you were chosen like we were all chosen. by man in moon.}
<A>__{jack turns and looks to the group.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(stares, dumbstruck)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tooth}
<D>__{last night, jack. he chose you.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the man in the moon, he talks to you?}
<A>__{jack looks up to the skylight, taking in the awesome sight of the moon as it shines down on earth.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{you see, you can not say no. it is destiny.}
<A>__{jack is still confused by the news. what does it mean?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{but why, why wouldn't he tell me that himself?}
<P>__{(exasperated exhale)}
<D>__{after 300 years this is his answer? to spend eternity like you guys cooped up in some, some hideout thinking of, of new ways to bribe kids? no no, that's not for me. no offense.}
<A>__{jack turns to leave, the guardians are stunned.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{how is that not offensive?}
<A>__{except for bunny, who is relieved by this turn and looks to the others.}
<D>__{guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 36.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{you know what i think? i think we just dodged a bullet. i mean, what's this clown know about bringing joy to children anyway?}
<A>__{jack turns back. a little pissed.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{uhh, you ever hear of a snow day? i know it's no hard boiled egg, but kids like what i do.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{but none of 'em believe in you.}
<P>__{(leans in to him)}
<D>__{do they? you see, you're invisible, mate. it's like you don't even exist.}
<C>__{tooth}
<D>__{bunny! enough!}
<A>__{silence. jack tries not to look stung by this.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no, the kangaroo's right.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<P>__{(glares)}
<D>__{the, the what what'd you call me? i am not a kangaroo, mate.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh. and this whole time i thought you were. if you're not a kangaroo, what are you?}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{i'm a bunny. the easter bunny. people believe in me.}
<A>__{sandy nudges north, who acknowledges the tension in the air.}
<C>__{north}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{jack. walk with me.}
