<C>__{lady fingers}
<D>__{you want to deal? then deal them yourselves. i'm going to the john. i'm going to get something to eat, and i'm going to take a nap. you barracudas can snap all you want but at each other i'm taking a break and if you don't like it you can both go to hell.}

<C>__{the kid}
<P>__{(meaning it)}
<D>__{listen, i think it is amazing you've been able to keep going this long.}
<A>__{as he heads for the door, lancey reacts to this. then stands and looks around the room. groups of people stand in the shadows watching silently, not hostile but certainly not friendly. he is the man but he is getting beat and nobody is sorry. after a moment he turns and leaves from a side door. camera pans to hold on christian as she stops the kid by the door.}
