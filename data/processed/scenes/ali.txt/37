<L>__{interior the ring cassius night}
<A>__{is struck by the brilliance. illuminated, ready to go... dancing...warming up. counter to an expectation of anxiety, cassius can't wait to get this on. other sounds happen...irrelevant to him...and now the distant sound of liston coming into the ring...his bulked up presence, the roar he inspires, somewhere over there. and all of a sudden, cassius turns to face the angry man who wishes him death. cassius rocks left and right, like a tough kid on a corner ready to rumble. the hysteria act is gone; so is the boasting. instead, there is only cassius' stare. the effect is enigmatic: what is going on here? a referee, like a distant bird, says something we don't hear... in the corner, his feet float, waiting. there's the bell for round one.}
