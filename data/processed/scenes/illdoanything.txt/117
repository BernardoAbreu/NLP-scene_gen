<L>__{interior studio floor burke and matt 20 minutes later}
<A>__{standing just behind the four television cameras, immediately behind them, the "rail" where the show's staff and crew members and network bosses stand crowded, choreographed in the way in which they "clear" for a moving camera. behind these people is the studio audience. there is a loud laugh. burke turns around to study the audience. burke's pov happy faces accompanied by the strains of burke's love song to the crowd...}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(to matt)}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<A>__{but matt doesn't hear him... a few feet away, jeannie is making ready for her big moment. three cameras swing in front of them, tv monitors showing a master and close ups of the three characters in the scene: a short comic white man, the black female lead, and jeannie, dressed as a poor child.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(wide eyed)}
<D>__{wait. this is it.}
<A>__{angle stage}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{it's like everyone is pi... ticked off at me because i'm not colored.}
<A>__{the white man jumps on the phrase.}
<C>__{short white man}
<P>__{(correcting her pompously)}
<D>__{the word is black.}
<C>__{black lead actress}
<P>__{(correcting him with booming voice)}
<D>__{the word is african american.}
<A>__{a burst of laughter, whooping and applause from the audience. burke brags in a whisper to matt.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i had them bring in two busloads of people from black churches.}
<A>__{angle stage as they play out the scene.}
<C>__{black lead actress}
<P>__{(scolding jeannie)}
<D>__{now you use it in a sentence.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{look at me, i...}
<B>__{on jeannie}
<A>__{and jeannie begins to falter... she must somehow cry at this moment... she looks outward for help. jeannie's pov she looks at the lead actress giving jeannie all she can.}
<B>__{back to jeannie}
<A>__{jeannie still can't cry. she looks past the cameras. jeannie's pov her father nervously pulling for her.}
<B>__{back to jeannie}
<A>__{that didn't do it either. she looks into herself... she blinks there are tears running down her cheek.}
<C>__{whole audience}
<D>__{awwwww.}
<B>__{group shot}
<A>__{matt, very much as he was when he watched brando on the plane... and then some. burke, craning to make sure the network bosses are suitably transported. back to jeannie's scene}
<C>__{black lead actress}
<D>__{go ahead. use it in a sentence.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<P>__{(crying fully)}
<D>__{look at me. i love an african american.}
<C>__{black lead actress}
<D>__{look at me. i love a little redneck.}
<A>__{the black lead actress holds out her arms to jeannie, who, tears streaming down her face, runs towards the arms...}
<B>__{on burke}
<A>__{his lips pursed tightly in pleasure, then agape in shock. burke's pov jeannie has run past the lead actress and off the set, going into her father's arms instead. she jumps on him, her legs and arms wrapped around him.}
<B>__{matt and jeannie}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(pridefully)}
<D>__{you little stinker!}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{you big stinker.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{my little stinker.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{my big stinker.}
<A>__{the background to this intimacy is enormously alive. the lead actress and the character actor laughing out loud. in the b.g., we see the audience filling out preview cards as the floor manager leans in to say:}
<C>__{floor manager}
<D>__{it's okay, jeannie. take a minute. we just need to get that hug at the end.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(to floor manager)}
<D>__{amazing, right?}
<C>__{floor manager}
<P>__{(to jeannie)}
<D>__{you were great.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{thank you. that's nice.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you look happy.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{i loved it, daddy.}
<A>__{matt starts to walk her back to the set.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you want me to put you down?}
<A>__{her answer surprises him.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{no. this is okay.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{okay... now, you're not finished until you hug the lady just like you did me.}
<A>__{he puts her down. she turns from him to go back to work but, on impulse, he restrains her. he is kneeling down, holding her lightly by the arms, her back to him as he states an ultimate truth:}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i'm very proud of you. i love you more than anybody.}
<A>__{jeannie, shocked by her father's unprecedented sentiment, turns to face him and clamp a hand over his mouth so he will add no more lush and primal affection. having silenced him though, she finds that she has something of her own to say. she'd never tell it to her father, but she can't resist telling it to her acting coach.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{when i had to cry, i thought of you buried in the ground.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(a beat, then)}
<D>__{give me a kiss.}
<A>__{she does.}
