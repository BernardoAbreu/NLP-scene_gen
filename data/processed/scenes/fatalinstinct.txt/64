<A>__{laura models hats... each one becoming more outrageous. she coaxes ned into joining her. they both try on women's hats... smiling and laughing... as "brown eyed girl" plays. in one of the mirrors, we see max shady's reflection... as he also tries on women's hats, watching them, puffing his cigar.}
<L>__{interior le hula bowl restaurant night}
<A>__{laura wears a baseball cap with beer cans attached to each side with long, curved plastic straws. the cap emblem reads "beer bimbo." a price tag hangs from it. she is beaming. in the b.g., hawaiian dancers juggle flaming torches as they dance around an ice sculpture of a hula dancer.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{it's nice to be off the streets... away from all the pain and misery out there.}
<A>__{ned motions casually toward the world "out there"... sticking his thumb into the eye of a waiter who is bending over to pick up a spoon, setting off a chaotic chain reaction of small disasters that finally culminates with someone near the dance floor bumping into the torch juggler, throwing his rhythm off. distracted, he starts catching the flaming ends of the torches! ow! oh! yi! ouch! yipes! he drops them all. the waiter who bumped into him, politely picks up one of the flaming torches and hands it back to the torch juggler. he grabs the flaming end of the torch... and lets out a scream! he lunges toward a voluptuous hula girl ice sculpture, grabbing the frozen breasts. his burned hands sizzle! ned and laura don't even notice... gazing only at each other.}
<C>__{laura }
<D>__{what's he thinking when he looks at me with that goofy smile...?}
<C>__{ned }
<D>__{boy, does she look stupid in that hat.}
<C>__{laura }
<D>__{if i told him how i really feel, he'd probably fire me. what am i saying? he probably doesn't even know i exist.}
<C>__{ned }
<D>__{laura's incredible. and so smart. smart enough to recognize that ginzu knives are the gift of a lifetime.}
<P>__{(then, concerned)}
<D>__{but she never goes out with guys. i wonder why?}
<C>__{laura }
<D>__{i guess i will just have to wait. but he's married. i could wait forever. than again... maybe lana will get hit by a runaway truck. there's always a chance that...}
<C>__{ned }
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{but who cares if she... oh, sorry.}
<C>__{laura }
<D>__{that's alright. i was just rambling.}
<C>__{ned }
<D>__{go ahead...}
<C>__{laura }
<D>__{no, no, really... you first...}
<C>__{ned }
<D>__{i insist... please...}

<C>__{ned}
<D>__{yeah. i'm driving up in the morning.}
<A>__{angle max shady sits at a corner table wearing a chic beret from the hat store, voraciously devouring a huge hawaiian pit roasted pig. he wrenches the apple from the pig's mouth... takes a huge bite!}
<B>__{back to ned and laura}
<A>__{a saxophone begins to wail "lola's theme." ned looks up, his eyes drawn to the lounge. he sees... lola... striking a sexy pose on a bar stool, eyes locked on ned. dizzy walks thru, behind the bar, playing his sax. she grabs a handful of cherries from a glass on the bar, shoves them in her mouth, cheeks bulging, tongue moving furiously. a moment later, she pulls out a long chain of inter locked cherry stems. ned reacts, shaken, glancing nervously at laura. she smiles, unaware. his eyes flash back to lola.}
<C>__{laura }
<D>__{he's so cute. he can't even look me in the eye.}
<A>__{ned's reacts intensely to... lola ned's pov she stretches out sensuously on the bar, executing a series of humanly impossible erotic gymnastic positions! then, wrapping her legs around a brass pole, she spins no handed... until her thighs begin to smoke! reverse angle on entire room the eyes of every male in the restaurant are riveted on lola!}
<B>__{closer on ned and laura}
<A>__{the table starts to rise slowly on ned's side, glasses sliding toward laura. she reaches out to stop them... noticing ned's distracted expression.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(touching his arm)}
<D>__{what is it, ned? you can tell me.}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(sighs, reluctant)}
<D>__{i'm a man, laura. and all men feel passion at one time or another. even me.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(hopeful)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{what would you think of a married man who gave in to those wild, sensual, raging desires?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{oh... wow... golly...}
<A>__{she gulps, eyes wide. the drums pound faster as the dancers in the b.g. pick up the frenetic tempo!}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{what if, for just one crazy moment, he couldn't resist...? he got knocked for a loop and lost control?}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(smiles, eager)}
<D>__{gosh... that might be okay.}
<A>__{breathless, she breaks a sweat, gasping for air. the drums beat louder, faster. the b.g. dancers whip into a frenzy!}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{what if a tidal wave of lust crashed over him and he was sucked into a vortex of wild, thrashing urges?}
<A>__{both of laura's ballcap beer cans explode! beer sprays out in a huge gush, drenching her! ned is so preoccupied with his own dilemma, he doesn't even notice. he heaves a sigh... pats her hand... smiles philosophically.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{well... it's not your problem. i will work it out.}
<A>__{angle an ice pick grasped tightly in lola's hand. she walks toward ned and laura, a seething rage in her eyes. as she passes the ice sculpture, she stabs the ice pick into the crystalline hula dancer's neck! the head breaks off. she catches it and keeps coming, tossing the head casually in one hand, like a basketball. lola appears suddenly at ned and laura's table. they look up.}
<C>__{lola}
<P>__{(to laura)}
<D>__{like some ice for your drink?}
<A>__{she drops the ice mermaid head. it shatters laura's glass to bits! lola turns to ned with a cold glare.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{does your wife know you're... "working" late? i certainly hope so, mr. ravine.}
<A>__{she lights her cigarette with the ice pick lighter, then flips it like a jackknife. it sticks into ned's chair, right between his legs. lola flashes a coldly arrogant smile at laura... then exits.}
