<A>__{from jeff's viewpoint, all the windows are dark. the couple are sleeping on the fire escape. the salesman's apartment is dark as well. suddenly a match flares, and we see the salesman light a cigar. the flame of the match illuminates his face for a moment. when is dies out, we see just the glow of the cigar burning.}

<A>__{the camera is now facing jeff. we see that his left hand rests on the telephone receiver which is close to him. the phone starts to ring, but makes only the slightest sound, as he instantly picks it up. as he talks, in a low voice, he keeps his eyes on the salesman's apartment.}
