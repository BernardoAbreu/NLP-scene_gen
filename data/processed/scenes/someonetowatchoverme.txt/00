<L>__{interior mike's house queens early evening}
<A>__{winter. a celebration. close friends, cop friends, family all here to celebrate patrolman mike keegan's promotion to detective, nypd. the party spills through the house front room, dining room, kitchen, with a small fenced backyard visible beyond that. a community of cops on their off hours, their wives, kids. a mix of generations, all the way from mike's kid, tommy, and his friends, playing among the adults, to an elderly woman observing quietly from her chair at the side. the mood's warm, spirited; there's a lot of friendship here. angle: mike, in the dining room, posing for a photo with his ten year old son, tommy, proudly displaying his new gold detective's shield pinned to his jersey.}

<A>__{angle: ellie, mike's wife of fifteen years, a local product, bright and lively, and clearly proud as hell of her man. she frees herself from the crush of friends, hurrying to join him. angle: mike, ellie giving him a full mouthed smack on the lips as he hooks her into his arms. the picture's snapped, to a chorus of hoots and hollers. behind, a banner and poster blowup of mike in gun and uniform read: "finally they've recognized you, detective keegan." scotty, a patrolman with the 117th and one of mike's best pals, puts his hand vigorously, in congratulations, on mike's shoulder.}
