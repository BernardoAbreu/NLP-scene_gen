<L>__{interior tv studio day}
<A>__{a row of parents standing near their child actors, adjusting them not unlike handlers of racing greyhounds.}
<B>__{on jeannie}
<A>__{seen from a distance her father behind her. in the foreground, the mass of workers on the stage, it is, in effect, her pov, even though she is in the extreme background of the shot. we move closer to jeannie and her father even a bit behind them. jeannie is scared.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i bet i know what it looks like to you.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{a giant "find waldo."}
<A>__{despite herself, she smiles at the reference, though her tone is a bit sarcastic.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{very funny.}
<C>__{passing voice}
<D>__{five minutes, children, then we need you for work on the set.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{set?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{that pretend living room, right over there.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{okay. set. bye...}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(holding her arm)}
<D>__{wait a second, jeannie. let daddy give you a few tips here.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<P>__{(twisting away)}
<D>__{nooo. i've got to get to work.}
<A>__{she breaks free, depriving matt of the sweet and simple moment he wanted with her. she's one of the first ones on the set, other kids still hugging their parents. as cathy comes up behind matt, we can hear jeannie who, having so small a trust for her father, needs to confirm what he just told her.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<P>__{(faintly)}
<D>__{is this the set?}
<A>__{matt reacts.}
<C>__{passing voice}
<D>__{parents to room two, please.}
<P>__{(as he goes by matt)}
<D>__{parents to room two, please.}
<A>__{jeannie is watching.}
<C>__{passing voice}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{we have to clear the set.}
<A>__{matt looks him off fiercely. the passing voice addresses the friendlier parents.}
<C>__{passing voice}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{this way, parents.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{i'm glad i found you.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{other area behind grandstand seats as they walk.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{you holding up? what did you do last night after i called?}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(as if teasing)}
<D>__{what do you think i did? i cried like a baby.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{okay. okay. so you don't want to tell me. be a tough guy.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{now you got it.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{i feel relieved just seeing you after all that stuff... whew... okay.}
<P>__{(preparing to go)}
<D>__{burke wants to...}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you ever go out with him?}
<A>__{cathy is as simple and direct as she is embarrassed.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you slept with him?}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{did you hate it?}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{eventually.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(reeling a bit)}
<D>__{good lord.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{this is the thing that makes me nervous about you... you keep on assuming i'm nicer than i am.}
<A>__{he kisses her. she kisses back. then there is an extraordinarily loud and piercing voice.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{dad!!}
<A>__{he turns to see jeannie beckoning to him from the stage the director, standing at her side, joins in. he walks to them. angle stage full of actors the director is talking to jeannie who seems, even from a distance, distraught and lost. she sees matt.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{there's such trouble.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{she's very worried about being able to pretend cry when she has to and she doesn't get it about memorizing. that's all.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<P>__{(aghast)}
<D>__{that's all?!?}
<A>__{the director beckons matt to lead her away. he does.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{this isn't going to be good.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{not with that attitude.}
<A>__{she seems stung by this, unusually vulnerable. he changes tactics, softening.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{it's just that they... well, did they tell you what an audience is?}
<C>__{jeannie}
<P>__{(insulted)}
<D>__{i know what an audience is.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{good. now, because there's an audience, they want you to know all the words you have to say really well. and since you can't read yet...}
<P>__{(off her fierce look)}
<D>__{...you're going to have to be patient and try hard. i can help you.}
<A>__{she grasps at this unlikely straw.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{can you help me to cry?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(on her broad disbelief)}
<D>__{i can. i can help make it okay. trust me.}
<A>__{jeannie pauses half a beat, then:}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{i miss my mother bigger than you know.}
