<L>__{interior incinerator room night}
<A>__{st. luc continues to poke around inside the incinerator with the poker. finally his flashlight beam reveals the tattered corpse of spergazzi's parasite. deftly manipulating the hook on the poker's tip, st. luc manages to pull the parasite out into the light. garbage comes rattling down the chute. when st. luc flashes his light into the oven, we see that the garbage consists of betts' french food, half eaten, silver servers and all, the snails being especially prominent. insane giggles echo down the chute, followed by the slam of the chute door somewhere several floors above. st. luc holds the thing up to the naked light bulb above the incinerator. the light seems to go right through the parasite, illuminating the twisted vascular system, reproductive organs, etc. as st. luc examines the creature, which is still impaled on the hook of the poker, the door to the incinerator room opens behind him. a large, hairy, muscular man enters the room and approaches the oblivious st. luc. the man slips his arms up under st. luc's arms and kisses him passionately on the neck. as soon as st. luc realizes what's happening, he smashes the man in the chest with his elbow and pulls free. the man grabs st. luc again, trying to kiss him on the mouth. they struggle. st. luc is thrown to the concrete floor. the man tries to pin him down. st. luc, on the verge of being overpowered, smashes the man in the chest with the poker, parasite still hooked into its tip. the man stands up unsteadily. st. luc cracks him on the ankle with the poker and he comes crashing down. the parasite corpse is flung across the room, where it smacks wetly into the wall and slides to the floor. st. luc leaps to his feet and begins kicking the man in the head. after a furious moment or two, he suddenly stops, drops the poker, and stares at the body in horrified disbelief. st. luc slowly backs away from the man's body, which is very still and quietly oozes blood on to the damp concrete floor. he bumps into the edge of the door left open by the man. the collision seems to startle him out of his daze somewhat, and he turns, himself scratched and bleeding, and staggers up the basement steps.}
