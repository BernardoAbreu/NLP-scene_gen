<L>__{exterior garden night}
<A>__{leopold makes his way through the manicured garden in the dark. he hears an eerie metallic sound. he slows down, brushes back the thicket. the silhouette of a woman is revealed. she is once again writing in her notebook.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{miss carlson?}
<A>__{carlson spins around quickly, panicked. leopold stops. partially hidden in the brush, a sleek, oddly shaped, mechanical device. it's door open, lit from within, casting a weird glow.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{good god...}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{what are you...? you frightened me.}
<A>__{leopold moves toward the contraption and is about to touch it...}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{what sort of mechanism is this?}
<A>__{carlson shakes her head, unsure of how to proceed.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{answer me!}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{it's perfectly all right. it's...}
<A>__{leopold carefully examines the apparatus, stepping inside. carlson freezes.}
<C>__{carlson}
<P>__{(carefully, deliberately)}
<D>__{listen to me. please. move very slowly. step out of the machine. step out and i will explain whatever you want to know.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{what is this? who are you?}
<A>__{his hand comes to rest on a glowing red lever.}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{oh, god.}
<A>__{she yanks on his arm. instinctively he pulls away, accidentally thrusting the lever into action. carlson falls from the machine.}
<C>__{carlson}
<P>__{(suddenly frantic)}
<D>__{get out of there! get out now!}
<A>__{the machine lights up.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{miss carlson... i...}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{no!!!}
<A>__{the compartment door snaps shut.}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{shit!!}
<A>__{there is a bright white flash. blackness fills the screen.}
