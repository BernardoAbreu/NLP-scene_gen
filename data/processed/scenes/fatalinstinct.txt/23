<C>__{mrs. shady}
<D>__{seven long, miserable years in the slammer. and he's a bit pissed off.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{well, being locked in a tiny room with no tv can make a guy feel pretty tense.}
<C>__{mrs. shady}
<D>__{i'm very concerned about him, mr. ravine. he said you were a two bit shyster... and he's going to rip your head off and use it for a bowling ball!}
<A>__{he goes to her, putting a comforting hand on her shoulder, looking her right in the eye, attempting to provide solace.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i'm sure the experience wasn't all negative. he probably made a lot of friends...}

<C>__{mrs. shady}
<D>__{maybe so... but he said he's going to punch you in the testicles...}
<A>__{she hauls off and punches him like a pile driver! wham! he doubles over, gasping.}
<C>__{mrs. shady}
<D>__{...smash your face...}
<A>__{she knees him in the face, raising him up... then nails him with a devastating right cross, spinning him around. he collapses over the desk.}
<C>__{mrs. shady}
<D>__{...and decimate your wardrobe.}
<A>__{she grabs the tail of his suit jacket and rips it up the back!}
<C>__{mrs. shady}
<D>__{and i wouldn't want that to happen.}
<P>__{(spanks his butt)}

<D>__{your insurance file. but the policy's missing. did you take it home?}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{laura looks puzzled... wondering where it might be. then...}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{oh, wait a second...}
<A>__{she goes to her desk in the outer office, digs through a drawer. suddenly, she gasps! she is holding...}
