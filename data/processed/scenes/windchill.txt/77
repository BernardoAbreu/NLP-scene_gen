<A>__{close on the radio, midway through "rockin' around the christmas tree..." our guy listens to the crunch crunch crunch of the cop's boots outside in the snow, circling the snowbound oldsmobile. whistling along with the song that always accompanies him. suddenly the dashboard air vents all open simultaneously. a gust of supernaturally frigid cold blows in, like the icy breath of old man winter himself. white frost spreads with time lapse velocity from the air vents across the dashboard. our guy scrambles up front, slapping the air vents closed. begins ripping off strips of duct tape to plaster over the vents to keep out the lethal chill. close on our girl as her nightmare becomes even more violent }
