<L>__{interior pirelli's apartment night}
<A>__{eddie cracks the door and peeks in. diana sits on the bed, a lonely forlorn figure. she looks at eddie, and tries a smile that fails. eddie walks over to sit on the bed next to her. she falls apart, and lies down, on the verge of crying, collapsing so that her head rest in eddie's lap. they are quiet like that for a moment, she curled into a ball, eddie stroking her hair.}
<C>__{diana}
<D>__{what do you do when you don't have anyone?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you find someone.}
<A>__{she looks up at him.}
<C>__{diana}
<D>__{could you... hold me for a while?}
<A>__{eddie lays on the bed beside her. she curls up in his arms, and closes her eyes. eddie's eyes remain open.}
