<A>__{sarah stumbles numbly to the sink. she splashes her face with cold water. in the mirror her terrified reflection looks back. why me? she hears a loud clatter and spins around. it's just a drunken woman fumbling with a toilet stall door. sarah edges back out into the corridor.}

<A>__{sarah exits the pizza place into the sparse crowd on the sidewalk. as she passes a figure leaning against the wall just outside, the man turns his head to watch her. it is reese, his gaze impassive. streetlight catches the burn scar on his cheek. he is motionless, sinister in his long coat. sarah shudders. she walks on. pov sarah, on crowd, moving toward and through approaching groups of pedestrians. they seem to be glancing at her. was it always like that and she just never noticed? c.u. sarah as she look over her shoulder. pov sarah, on pizza parlor doorway. reese is gone. she resists the urge to run. on the opposite side of the street an lapd cruiser glides slowly by. sarah is about to call out but a bus blocks her view and when it had passed, the car is turning away down a side street. she passes a large window with stoker's written on it, and ducks quickly through the door.}
