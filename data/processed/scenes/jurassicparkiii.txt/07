<L>__{interior auditorium day}
<A>__{the last stop on grant's fund raising tour, it's a public lecture hosted by some foundation. there are scientists and students here, but also a lot of dino fans, some even with costumes. grant finishes his speech to what was a full house some attendees are grabbing their coats and sneaking out. this wasn't the exciting guest speaker they were all expecting. a new slide comes up. just black and white, and indecipherable.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{it's through the painstaking study of the interior chamber in multiple specimens that we can determine this exciting correlation between the larynx and the upper plate. that lets us theorize theorize, mind you that the raptor might have been capable of bird like vocalizations. which as you can imagine, would be a tremendous breakthrough.}
<A>__{he's finished, but no one seems to notice at first. then the sympostum leader stands up, leading a smattering round of}
<B>__{applause.}
<C>__{sympostium leader}
<D>__{thank you very much dr. grant. now does anyone have a question?}
<A>__{nearly every hand goes up. grant doesn't seem surprised.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{does anyone have a question that doesn't relate to jurassic park?}
<A>__{quite a few hands go down.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{or the incident in san diego, which i will remind you, i did not witness.}
<A>__{now most of the hands are down. picking one of the few remaining...}
<C>__{male student}
<D>__{your theory on raptors is good and all, but isn't all this conjecture kind of moot?}
<A>__{the student's buddy nods in agreement.}
<C>__{male student }
<D>__{i mean, once the u.n. and costa rica and everyone decides how to handle the second island, scientist will just go in and look for themselves. too clever science reporter isn't paleontology itself in danger of extinction?}
<A>__{recognizing those as fighting words, the symposium leader is about to step in. but grant will take this himself.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{no, and let me be perfectly clear on this pointerior dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago. what's left of them is fossilized in stone the actual scientists spend years to undercover.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{what john hammond and ingen created are theme park monsters. nothing more, nothing less. the class clearly disagrees with his assessment.}
<C>__{another student}
<D>__{you're saying you wouldn't want to study them if you had the chance?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{no force on this earth or in heaven could get me on that island.}
