<A>__{sam heading towards the stalled harvester. it soon becomes apparent that there is something stuck under the front of the harvester's axle. a second later it is apparent what that something is: inevitably, it's the missing rover. sam slows his rover down, approaching the scene with caution. he parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens the door of his rover, stepping outside gingerly. one sixth gravity is like walking on a trampoline. sam takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep footprints in the lunar soil.}

<A>__{the crashed rover is exactly as we left it after the accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles of the harvester. sam peers closer and sees that there is an unconscious man in a lunar industries space suit trapped inside. sam can't see the man's face he has his back to sam, his body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching for loose change on the floor of the vehicle. with great effort sam manages to prize the rover's door open. he reaches inside and begins to pull the man out sam's sheer adrenaline giving him the strength of a yeti. sam drags the unconscious man away from the crashed rover, his body leaving a big track mark in the gray soil. sam takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and turns the unconscious man onto his back. he brushes dust from the glass of the man's helmet, leans down even closer. close up the man through his helmet we see a bloody and bearded sam. sam as we remember him. the sam from the opening twenty minutes of the film. sam's face as the panic, the alarm, the shock, the realization hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has just pulled out of the crashed rover is himself. wide shot the stalled harvester sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him to the parked rover.}
