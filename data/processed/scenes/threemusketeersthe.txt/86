<L>__{interior throne room and great hall}
<A>__{louis watches from a balcony. richelieu appears, fresh from his encounter with the queen.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{i'm sorry to be late, your majesty, but i was wrestling with an important matter of state.}
<A>__{richelieu never allows the mask to slip. even for an instant. louis glances at the throne room, the increasing number of cardinal's guards on duty. they make him feel uncomfortable. louis speaks with renewed determination.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{why is it i don't see any of my musketeers?}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{i'm afraid... that's impossible.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{they have become outlaws. they are terrorizing the countryside, robbing and killing innocent people.}
<A>__{louis can't believe it.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{there must be some mistake.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{no mistake. i have reports from the local constables involved.}
<A>__{richelieu, ever prepared, produces a sheaf of papers. no doubt counterfeit. but louis has no way of knowing. he takes the papers into his hands, reacts with sadness.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{musketeers...}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{they are better off disbanded.}
<A>__{louis turns back to the balcony, the soldiers marching below. his mood glum and lonely. he sighs, moves on to another matter of business.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{your eminence, i've been hearing some very troubling rumors about you.}
<A>__{richelieu nods, not the least bit concerned.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{there are so many to choose from. is it the one about my alleged alliance with buckingham? let's see if i remember it correctly. while the english attack from without, i will undermine the throne from within depose you and become sovereign of france myself. that rumor, your majesty?}
<A>__{richelieu smiles, his face a mask of innocence.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{it does seem rather farfetched.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{if there are any doubts of my loyalty, they'll be put to rest when we appear together at your birthday celebration.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i've been thinking about that. a birthday celebration when we're on the brink of war...}
<C>__{richelieu}
<P>__{(alert, ready for this as well)}
<D>__{your subjects are eager to celebrate the birth of their king at a time like this.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i'm not so eager.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{i have an idea. why don't you discuss the matter with your queen?}
<A>__{louis looks up, wonders. as richelieu draws him deeper into his spider's strategems.}
