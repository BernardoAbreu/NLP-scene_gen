<A>__{miles and jack are seated in webbed chairs around a circular glass table. they are mid meal. everyone is more than a little lubricated, especially the birthday girl as she returns from the kitchen with another plate of food.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{mrs. raymond, this is delicious. absolutely delicious.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<P>__{(sitting)}
<D>__{they're just leftovers.}

<D>__{it was a surprise, mom.}
