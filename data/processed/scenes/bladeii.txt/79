<A>__{the reaper nearest priest turns in his direction. we recognize her as the nurse from the bloodbank. she leaps at priest priest fires a glaser round through the she reaper's head. the reaper twists in mid leap, falls to the floor, then picks herself up again. like scud's reaper, she seems unaffected by the custom made ammo.}

<A>__{having similarly disastrous results. the reapers are shrugging off their firepower. asad leaps, snapping a reaper's neck with a spinning heel kick, but the reaper keeps coming!}
<B>__{back to the priest}
<A>__{alarmed, reaching for a specialized shotgun instead. the reaper continues forward, moving so fast she almost seems a blur as ba boom! ba boom! priest pumps his shotgun repeatedly. two projectiles fire out, chained together by a length of titanium cable. the cable catches the reaper in the mid section, cutting it clean in half! the upper half of the reaper falls, then rights itself, landing on its clawed hands. impossibly, the she reaper keeps coming! she skitters towards priest on his hands like the half man from todd browning's "freaks". the half reaper launches itself at priest, hitting him in the chest, knocking him back to the floor. priest panics as he struggles with the thing, trying to fend off its claws and fangs as it locks its mouth into his arm. he screams.}
