<L>__{interior morgue}
<A>__{tiled floor and refrigerated corpses. nobody's around when gabriel enters. he walks over to a file cabinet and removes a thick folder. then he walks to the big filing cabinets, the ones that hold a body in each drawer. he strolls along, tapping each label till he finds the one he's looking for, slides it open, and looks down at the naked body of the gargoyle. he's been sewed back together. kind of. gabriel grabs the eyeless corpse under the armpits and drags him out onto the floor where he pushes the legs together and outstretches the arms, like a crucifix. from his coat gabriel takes out a small vial of oil and rubs it onto the gargoyle's feet and hands. anointing them. then with the tip of his finger, he draws a faint sign of the cross on the forehead, stands, and walks for the door. in the background, as gabriel leaves, we see the body of the gargoyle burst into flame.}
