<L>__{interior bunkhouse early evening}
<A>__{in the newly painted, spruced up cider house, homer and candy are dancing to another slow, sexy song on the radio. he is untucking her blouse, feeling under her blouse she starts to unbutton his shirt. they kiss while they dance. but the song changes abruptly on the radio to something fast and silly. homer responds to the music, dancing goofily instantly out of the mood. candy laughs, but she picks up a pillow and swings it at him, hitting him. he dances away from her. she throws the pillow; he ducks the pillow lands somewhere near the door. now homer grabs a pillow and chases her from bed to bed. she shrieks they're both laughing. they each grab a pillow and stand toe to toe whacking each other, laughing all the while, until he pins her arms behind her and, breathing hard and despite the stupid music that broke the mood they are passionately kissing again. the sound of a truck is sudden and loud.}
