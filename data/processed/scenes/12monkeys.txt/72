<L>__{exterior vacant lot moments later (day)}
<A>__{crackheads huddle against a building, sucking their pipes, oblivious to cole pulling railly past. cole scans the walls for messages in the confusion of graffiti. railly is considering her surroundings dubiously when, suddenly, cole pulls her toward the mouth of a dark and forbidding alley.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{james, no we shouldn't be here!}
<A>__{cole ignores her, yanking her after him into the alley.}
<L>__{interior dark alley day}
<A>__{two tom cats face off, arching their backs and hissing menacingly. cole avoids them as he pulls railly into the gloom. angle on railly, seeing something alarming twenty yards ahead! railly's pov: two thugs, standing over a man, kicking him. railly tries to stop, but cole, intent on the wall messages, doesn't notice the thugs. the two thugs turn and spot cole and railly moving toward them. these creeps have mean eyes, predator faces. railly digs her heels in, forcing cole to stop.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{james! we have to go back. those men...}
<A>__{too late. while cole turns and stares at her, uncomprehending, the two thugs are approaching.}
<C>__{first thug}
<D>__{hey, buddy.}
<A>__{startled, cole turns to face them. the second thug lunges for railly's purse, yanks it from her. cole reaches to grab it back, but...whack! the first thug smacks cole hard across the face with something metallic. bloody faced, dazed, cole doesn't even have a chance to clear his head as the first thug shoves the hard object against cole's cheek. it's a cheap thirty eight pistol. railly turns to run, gets two steps before the second thug knocks her roughly to the ground.}
<C>__{second thug}
<D>__{stick around, bitch.}
<A>__{looming over her, the second thug starts to unzip his fly. railly looks over to cole, sees... cole dropping to his knees, groveling at the first thug's feet.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{please! please don't hurt me!}
<A>__{the first thug steps close, kicks cole contemptuously, cocks his foot for a second kick when... cole uncoils, lunging, rising, his strong arms around the bigger man's calves, lifting him mightily, high off the ground. the gun fires wildly as cole staggers forward with the first thug in his arms and smashes the man into the brick wail behind him. the first thug goes down in a heap, dropping the pistol. zipping his fly hastily, the second thug turns to deal with cole but cole attacks him....rocking him again and again with savage blows that come one after another with lightning speed. the second thug staggers back, bloody and dazed as railly watches, amazed. turning back to the first thug, cole sees the man reaching for the dropped pistol. cole kicks him viciously in the jaw. the first thug's head whips back. snap! he collapses against the brick wall. cole turns back to see the second thug retreating down the alley as fast as he can stagger. railly stares up at cole. he looks very dangerous. he glances in her direction as he pockets the pistol.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{are you hurt?}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{uh, no. yes. i mean, just some scrapes...}
<A>__{as railly gets to her feet, she sees cole bend over the motionless thug and quickly go through his pockets.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{is he...alive?}
<A>__{cole ignores the question as he pockets the man's wallet and a handful of bullets, then turns and snaps at railly.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{come an. we're running out of time. you can't help him.}
<A>__{as cole yanks her roughly away, she looks back, sees the first thug's sightless eyes, wide open...staring blankly.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{oh, jesus, james! you killed him!}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i did him a favor. now come on.}
<A>__{cole, pulling her again, sees more "12 monkeys" on the wall.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{you didn't have a gun before, did you?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i've got one now.}
