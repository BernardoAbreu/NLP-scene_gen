<D>__{why do you go then?}

<D>__{i'm not sure i can explain to you the concept of not doing well in a class..in this case math...and the system kind of insists on the illusion that you've learned math so they make you go to summer school..it helps them avoid facing that they have failed in their mission.}
<C>__{cristina}

<C>__{bernice}
<D>__{joking.}
<C>__{cristina}
