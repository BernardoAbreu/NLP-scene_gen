<A>__{jack and trevor watch in amazement as grant slithers across the field, his large, dark, watery eyes searching out prey. jack turns to trevor, pissed, and whispers:}

<D>__{you said 'squid'!}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{it got worse.}
<A>__{the redneck and the good ol' boy watch too, mouths dropped. the diseased grant slithers through the grass just a few feet beside margaret and the older cop. they duck below the grass, looking as if they're going to have heart attacks. grant approaches a cow. the cow makes a little moo of protest when he gets too close, and steps back. the grant creature stabs one of his tentacle growths into the cow's neck, piercing it. the cow stumbles, choking. blood spurts from her neck. and she topples over.}
