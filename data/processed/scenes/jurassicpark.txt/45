<A>__{regis slowly crawls out from between a couple large boulders. he looks around carefully. he peels mud off his face and rubs his neck. he touches his cheek. close on regis' swollen cheek. he rubs it with his finger. suddenly, he swats at his own mouth. he reaches in and pulls out a leech fat with blood. he hurls it to the ground, spitting. he grabs another off his arm and rips if off, leaving a bloody streak. he digs in his pants and pulls out another. he screams. as soon as he has done so, he knows he's made a mistake. he looks around frantically. sees the rex trot down the road toward him.}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{noooooo!}
<A>__{back on hillside grant and the kids crest the hill. grant puts on the night goggles and adjusts the dial and looks toward regis. the kids can't see that far.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<A>__{grant's green pov regis and the rex bounding after him. regis hugs a tree, unmoving. grant whispers to the kids.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{it's regis and the rex is after him. but it's okay. regis knows the rex can't see him. evidently, he can only see move ment. regis'll be ok if he stays still.}
<A>__{after a long moment, the tyrannosaur walks away, disappears into the shadows. regis waits another long moment and releases his tree. grant's pov the tyrannosaur leaps out of the shadows and knocks regis to the ground. regis jumps up and backs off. the animal knocks him right back down. regis jumps up again and screams at the beast.}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{you don't want to hurt mr. regis. go away. ed's your friend. back off!}
<A>__{the rex watches him dance around. it goes toward him. this time its jaws are open. regis screams and in the middle, the scream cuts off. grant lets the goggles fall off his face. they hit the ground with a metallic clink. the rex turns toward grant and the kids.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{let's go!}
<A>__{grant grabs both the kids' hands and they begin to run. back on tour rest area drops of water splat on a big fern. light swims in the little puddle. in the sky above, clouds hurry by, intermittently revealing a half obscured moon. the torn fence lies in a crumpled, twisted mess. the wheel of a land cruiser spins. a little lizard runs in place on it. the sound of the jeep's engine. it's muldoon and ellie. their pov a single cruiser lies on its side in the middle of the road.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{oh, my god! where's the other one?}
<A>__{before the cruiser stops, she j umps out. muldoon shouts a whisper.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{ellie!}
<A>__{ellie turns in the headlight beams. muldoon tosses her a flashlight.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{wait up.}
<A>__{muldoon skids to a stop, leaps out of the car. he catches up to ellie. they share a frightened, apprehensive look. muldoon gets on his knees and and touches a muddies area.}

<A>__{ellie looks out into the forest.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{then they must be out there. they must be out there. i know it.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{perhaps.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{no! they're out there.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{i've seen a lot of animal attacks in the bush. it's not as gory and horrifying to see as you'd think. no pools of blood or exposed bones. there is usually little or no evidence left behind. and if}
<A>__{victims}
<D>__{are small, a predator can kill by just shaking the little thing to death, eating it, and leave not so much as a button.}
<A>__{a definite rustling in the brush. ellie jumps and screams. muldoon puts his hand over her mouth and pushes her down. they both squat by the cruiser. silence. ellie swallows. muldoon slowly gets up. ellie follows. their flashlights swing back and forth in the night. twigs crack under their feet. ellie hears the rustle at the edge of the forest. she shines her light into the brush. she catches her breath. her hand shakes. ellie flashes her beam right, left, up, down. jumps. something is coming at her, rolling at her. she gasps, steps back. it's too late. it's gennaro. his limp body stops at her feet. she covers her mouth. muldoon runs to her. gennaro is face down. muldoon takes his pulse.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{thank god. (beat) we have to carry him. first i have to ...}
<A>__{he stands and removes his jacket. close on muldoon tears the jacket into long strips. he wraps gennaro's wounds.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{he's losing a lot of blood. help me.}
<A>__{muldoon and ellie carry gennaro to the jeep. they lay him on the back seat. muldoon jumps in back with him. he keeps wrapping the wounds. ellie starts the engine, looks back at him.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{looks like you've been through this before.}
<A>__{muldoon looks up.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{i told you i've seen big game attacks in africa.}
<A>__{she starts the engine.}

<D>__{right.}
<A>__{ellie skids out of there.}
