<A>__{to a sudden rush through a long dark tunnel. there is a sense of enormous speed accelerating toward a brilliant light. the rush suggests a passage between life and death, but as the light bursts upon us we realize that we are passing through a subway station far below the city of new york.}
<L>__{interior subway night}
<A>__{the wheels of an express train screech through the station. jacob singer, sitting alone in the last car, wakes up. the sounds of the scream and the grating wheels merge. he is dazed and confused, not certain where he is. jacob glances around the empty car. his eyes gravitate to overhead advertisements for hemorrhoid perparations and savings banks. gradually his confusion subsides. shifting uncomfortably he pulls a thick book out of his back pocket, "the stranger" by albert camus. he begins reading. another station blurs by. jacob is a good looking man, of obvious intelligence. he is in his mid thirties. it is surprising that he is wearing a mailman's uniform. he doesn't look like one. the subway ride seems to go on interminably. jacob is restless and concerned. he glances at his watch. it is 3:30 a.m. putting his book in his back pocket, jacob stands up and makes his way through the deserted car.}
