<C>__{pat}
<D>__{nikki's waiting for me to get in shape and get my life in order, and then she's gonna be with me. and that's better than any medication.}
<C>__{dr. patel}
<D>__{pat, there's a possibility, and i want you to be prepared for it, that she may not return. true love is about letting her go and seeing if she returns. in the meantime, if you listen to that song, i don't want you to fall apart. so get a strategy, okay? you need one.}
