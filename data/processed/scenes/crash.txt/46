<L>__{interior vaughan's lincoln night}
<A>__{vaughan drives the lincoln through a scarred, bleak landscape. in the front seat with him are helen and james. seagrave is lying down in the back seat with his eyes closed.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{that was glib, wasn't it? 'james dean died of a broken neck and became immortal.' but i couldn't resist.}
<A>__{vaughan puts his hand between helen's thighs. she seems not to notice, but her eyes close dreamily every once in a while. james watches microscopically. sometimes, when the flow of traffic allows, vaughan stares intently at james while his hand works away between helen's thighs, and james looks away, flushed, like a schoolgirl.}
