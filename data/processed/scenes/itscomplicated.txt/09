<L>__{interior doctor's office following}
<A>__{way too chic for a dentist's office. jane sits nervously in a chair in a well styled, well upholstered examination room. the door opens quickly and a handsome, crisp looking doctor}
<B>__{enters.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{hi. i'm dr. moss.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(shaking his hand)}
<D>__{hi. jane adler. so, i just wanted to start with... and please don't take this the wrong way but i'm the type of person who kind of makes fun of people who get plastic surgery.}
<C>__{dr. moss}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you do? good, because, you know, some women can look a little fake and plasticky. and in my opinion worse.}
<C>__{dr. moss}
<D>__{i agree.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{oh, that's good, so, well, as against the whole thing as i am, i do have a problem that's been bugging me. my left eyelid is really saggy. i find i'm sometimes holding it up when i'm watching tv or reading and i was wondering if that's something you could fix.}
<C>__{dr. moss}
<P>__{(looking at her closely)}
<D>__{it's resting on your eye lashes.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{is it?}
<C>__{dr. moss}
<P>__{(measures her lids with a very tiny ruler)}
<D>__{actually you have the same amount of excess skin on both sides.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i do? well, i'm only interested in fixing one eye.}
<C>__{dr. moss}
<D>__{jane, what you need to fix this is a brow lift.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{a brow lift? wh what is that exactly?}
<C>__{dr. moss}
<D>__{we surgically cut at your hair line. incision goes right across here.}
<P>__{(demonstrates on himself}
<D>__{by indicating a line}
<P>__{drawn like a headband)}
<D>__{then we just lift the skin up a little tighter across the skull.}
<P>__{(jane nods, already hating this)}
<D>__{we staple it back in place right above your ears. recovery isn't all that bad but you could be fairly numb and you'll probably have a headache that lasts anywhere from say 3 to 6 months.}
