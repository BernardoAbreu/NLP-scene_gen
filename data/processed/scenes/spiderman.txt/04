<L>__{exterior empire state university day}
<A>__{as students go to class, the sound of the cyclotron spills out of the science center onto the grounds of empire state university. we see peter parker, a pleasant faced senior who's among the top in his class. sincere and serious, he has yet to develop a way with women.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(falling in step)}
<D>__{hiya peter...}
<A>__{liz allen is also a senior. she's beautiful and intelligent.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(ardent but uncomfortable)}
<D>__{hiya liz... how're you doing...?}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(teasing softly)}
<D>__{how'm i doing what?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{peter! peter! wait up!}
<A>__{harry is the school nerd. a quirky kid who, like peter, can be a little backward around girls, especially pretty ones like liz.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(to liz)}
<D>__{would you, uh... excuse us for a minute?}
<A>__{despite peter's protesting body language, harry pulls him away like a conspirator.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what is it? what...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{did the astro physics journal really accept your paper?}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(laughs, embarrassed)}
<D>__{yeah... well... all i got's the data but they've agreed to publish it when it's finished. you know... it's my calculation on the planetary conjunction.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{and its influence on the anti force. isn't it?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yes. look, harry, i am busy with...}
<P>__{(indicates liz standing there)}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, you and the rest of the class. every one is busy with liz.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(growing impatient)}
<D>__{peter?}
<A>__{a hand reaches in and smacks her bottom.}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{hiya, cupcakes...}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(elbowing him affectionately)}
<D>__{flash...!}
<A>__{they kiss and walk away.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(sneering)}
<D>__{and flash is the busiest of them all...}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{come on, harry... we'll be late for octavius.}
<A>__{harry makes a gesture dismissing ock as crazy.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{ock is nuts, don't you agree?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{ock is a genius, harry. crazy, yes! but, a genius misunderstood, and unappreciated.}
