<L>__{interior thomas's car day}
<A>__{katherine and thomas drive back down the road leading to town.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{chinamen? chosin? i've never heard her talk like that before.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{chosin reservoir was a korean war battle the marines had against the chinese, supposedly the bloodiest hand to hand fighting of the century. someone been teaching that to your class?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{sure, right next to jack 'n jill.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{where would she have heard it?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{nobody i can think of.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{maybe one.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{general hawthorne.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{did she know him?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{he didn't like children.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{you couldn't and tell a story like that to one.}
<A>__{he pulls over to the side near the copper mine entrance. no sign of the rambler.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{it was there earlier.}
<A>__{thomas drives up the dirt path to the mine's tunnel entrance. they climb out and stand near its mouth. in the dust is the rambler's tracks and several footprints leading into the mine. thomas steps up to the edge of the tunnel. it's a black, yawning thing that swallows the sunlight whole for breakfast.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{if i was smart i'd call the sheriff or somebody in town who knows this place. then again, there is one thing worse than getting killed.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{looking like an idiot if it's nothing.}
<A>__{he pops his trunk and takes out a flashlight.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{i will come along.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{no, if someone has to fall a hundred feet down a black pit, he should at least be on official duty.}
<A>__{thomas switches on the light and takes a tentative step inside.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{then again, it is kind of spooky in there. here, you can hold the flashlight.}
