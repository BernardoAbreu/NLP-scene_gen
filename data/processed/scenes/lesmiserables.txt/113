<A>__{look outs keep watch at either end of the barricaded street. many of the rest of the rebels are sleeping. valjean paces, unable to sleep, inside the cafe. dead bodies are lined up on the ground floor. he comes to a stop, and gazes on marius as he sleeps through the window.}

<D>__{in my need you have always been there. he is young he's afraid let him rest heaven blessed. bring him home bring him home bring him home! he's like the son i might have known if god had granted me a son. the summers die one by one how soon they fly on and on and i am old and will be gone. bring him peace bring him joy he is young he is only a boy. you can take you can give let him be let him live, if i die, let me die let him live bring him home bring him home bring him home!}
<A>__{valjean is now kneeling next to the sleeping marius. crane up and up seeing the little world of the barricaded street now surrounded by waiting soldiers and the streets round them packed with soldiers in their thousands, so many that we know the little band can never win. crane up and up until the barricade and the army that entraps it has become a small pool of darkness in the centre of the bright lights of paris.}
