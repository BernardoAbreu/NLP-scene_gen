<L>__{interior milo & alice's house middle of the night}
<A>__{milo sits on the couch, in dim light. alice comes in.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{you okay?}
<P>__{(sits by him, holds him)}
<D>__{i miss him, too.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior dining room terrace day}
<A>__{milo eats alone. through the window, he sees lisa inside. she's eating alone, too. gary comes trotting up.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{milo?}
<A>__{he is unclasping a manila envelope; he takes pages out.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{wow. you must have 20,000 lines of code there...}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{34,000. but they're real short lines. 'just came out that way.}
<A>__{seeing gary's code, milo knits his brow: it must be sort of like teddy's.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. and it came over me: it's in the wrong place.}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(an uncertain smile)}
<D>__{the wrong place?}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{the answer's not in the box. it's in the band.}
<A>__{milo's smile freezes. as he stares at gary, we zoom with a reverse dolly so that the background retreats queasily but gary remains dominant in frame. for milo, it feels like the very ground is going out from under him. gary continues to explain, pointing at lines of code. and milo pretends to listen. but he can't even make out the words gary speaks he hears only a jumble of echoes. milo nods mechanically; he wants to scream. or run. he perceives, amid the echoes, that gary is standing, smiling, saying "see you later." and he's gone. milo touches the pages, like some talisman of teddy.}
<C>__{lisa }
<D>__{milo? you okay?}
<A>__{it strikes him she always shows up at these moments. he gathers his wits before looking up.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{gotta go home. 'think i ate something.}
