<L>__{interior film studio. camera room day}
<A>__{we float toward the door marked camera dept. inside the room we find a young woman, a camera assistant, wearing a t shirt and heavy woolen socks and work boots and nothing else. she is draped across a table strewn with camera parts, stomach down, head resting on a black, crackle finish camera magazine, her legs spread. camera parts and cases, tripods, changing bags everywhere. a man is behind her, kissing the backs of her thighs. we hear the sound of the ad approaching with deliberately heavy footsteps. the ad pauses just outside the door.}
