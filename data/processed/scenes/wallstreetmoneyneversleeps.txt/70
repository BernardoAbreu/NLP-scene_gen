<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{if he offers you a line of coke snort it.}

<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{if he offers you a child raise it.}
<A>__{and it seems a model bomb has recently exploded at oleg's table... leaving the skinny shards everywhere. oleg sees them, stands and opens his arms.}
<C>__{oleg}
<D>__{bretton woods has arrived.}
<A>__{bretton smiles. they head over. oleg turns to one of the model girls next to him.}

<C>__{oleg }
<D>__{this is one of two hundred bottles discovered on a shipwreck off the coast of finland... thirty grand a bottle.}
