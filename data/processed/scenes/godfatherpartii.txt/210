<L>__{exterior tahoe estate day}
<A>__{the first snow of the new year has fallen; the trees are bare, and there is hush all over this part of the sierras. michael is driven in his car, looking out at the familiar sight of the home he has been forced to be away from.}
<B>__{view on michael}
<A>__{looking out from his window. the last time he had seen the estate it was warm, and the trees were full.}
<B>__{moving view}
<A>__{approaching the great stone gates; closed. the bodyguards are not readily visible, but they are there. the iron gates are opened, and one of the men makes a simple nod of respect, as the car pulls in.}
<B>__{new view}
<A>__{inside the estate, the private roads have been freshly plowed, and occasionally a worker will pause to watch the car as it passes. the grandchildren are in school now, and so the estate is especially quiet. although there are signs that children live here; a bicycle, a sled, a swing and gymnastic set, wet and with a rim of snow still on it.}
