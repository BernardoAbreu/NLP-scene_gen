<L>__{interior car. bonnie and clyde. day.}
<A>__{bonnie grabs the wheel and turns it sharply.}
<L>__{exterior car. day.}
<A>__{it hairpins off the road onto a shoulder beneath some trees.}
<L>__{interior car. bonnie and clyde. day.}
<A>__{ still settling to a stop. bonnie and clyde appear to be necking heavily now, punctuated by bonnie's squeals of passion as she squirms and hops about like a flea, trying to get to clyde. the floor gear shift is keeping their bodies apart, however. in exasperation, bonnie takes the gear shift and shoves it forward out of their way. she plunges onto clyde, burying him from view.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(kissing, biting)}
<D>__{...you ready?...}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(muffled, laughing)}
<D>__{...hey, wait...}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(giggling herself)}
<D>__{aren't you ready? well, get ready!}
<A>__{bonnie has obviously touched him. with savage coquetry she tears into her clothes and his.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(muffled)}
<D>__{c'mon, honey, c'mon, boy...let's go...let's...}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(muffled)}
<D>__{hey...hey, wait a minute...quit that now, cut it out.}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{i said, cut it out!}
<A>__{he shoves her rudely away, slamming her into the far car door. suddenly it looks as if they've been fighting. both unbuttoned and unglued, they stare silently at one another, breathing heavily. clyde gets out of the car, clearly shaken. despite the fact that he may have encountered this situation many times before, it's one that no twenty one year old boy in 1932 is sophisticated enough to dismiss easily with bravado. bonnie remains seated in the car. she seems terribly vulnerable. she fumbles about for a cigarette, too confused to figure out what didn't happen. clyde turns back and reaches through the car window from the driver's side, lighting it for her. bonnie casts clyde a fishy stare, then accepts the light.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(trying to be casual, even insouciant)}
<D>__{look, i don't do that. it's not that i can't }
<P>__{(his voice cracks,}
<D>__{the match burns his fingers, and he bangs his head onto roof of car, and he goes}
<P>__{right on)}
<D>__{ it's just that i don't see no percentage in it.}
<C>__{clyde }
<D>__{i mean there's nothin' wrong with me, i don't like boys.}
<A>__{bonnie doesn't know what she thinks, and clyde is trying to gauge her reaction whether she feels rejected or repelled. in fact, it's both along with a little latent fascination.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(finally, spitting out smoke)}
<D>__{boy...boy...boy...}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(a little annoyed)}
<D>__{boy, what?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{your advertising is dandy. folks'd just never guess you don't have a thing to sell.}
<P>__{(a little afraid)}
<D>__{you better take me home, now.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(getting back into car)}
<D>__{wait!}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{don't touch me!}
<A>__{she gets out of car, leaving clyde draped across the front seat, reaching after her.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(almost shouting)}
<D>__{if all you want's stud service, then get on back to west dallas and stay there the rest of your life!}
<A>__{this stops her. now clyde pours it on, with an almost maniacal exuberance that becomes more controlled as he gets control of bonnie.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{but you're worth more'n that, a lot more, and you know it, and that's why you come along with me. you could find a lover boy on every corner in town and it doesn't make a damn to them whether you're waiting on tables or picking cotton, so long as you cooperate. but it does make a damn to me!}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(turning, intrigued)}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{why? because you're different! you're like me and you want different things.}
<A>__{bonnie is hooked now.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you and me travelin' together, we could cut clean acrost this state, and kansas, too, and maybe dip into oklahoma, and missouri or whatnot, and catch ourselves highpockets and a highheeled ol' time. we can be somethin' we could never be alone. i will show you...when we walk into the adolphus hotel in san antone', you wearin' a silk dress, they'll be waitin' on you and believe me, sugar, they're gonna know your last name.}
<A>__{he stops, having begun to woo her to something more intense than a casual, physical coupling.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{when'd you figure that all out?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{first time i saw you.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{how come?}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(intensely, with real honesty)}
<D>__{'cause you may be the best damn girl in texas.}
<A>__{close up. bonnie.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{who are you, anyway?}
