<L>__{exterior broad avenue on batwing}
<A>__{the black ultralight hurtles down broad avenue at full speed, on a suicide mission. missiles streak past on either side. machine gun fire peppers the dome of the cockpit. the rear stabilizer wing takes a direct hit... and bursts into flame! the batwing, trailing thick black smoke, bears down on the tank like a kamikaze plane. bomb bays open as batman dumps the last of his high explosives directly into the path of the tank. the batwing takes a hard bounce off the top of the tank and crashes to the street. and suddenly a gaping chasm opens underneath the tank as the bombs go off and broad avenue begins to split wide open!}
