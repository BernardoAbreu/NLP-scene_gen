<L>__{interior tina's mother's bedroom. night.}
<A>__{just inside the door nancy slips and goes down hard. glen finds her in the dark more by touch than sight.}
<C>__{glen}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{yeah. something slippering all over here...}
<P>__{(feeling)}
<D>__{tina?}
<A>__{no answer. the room is quiet as a tomb. except for a stead dripping, from all over. then glen finds a light switch. on the click the devastation is revealed. there's blood everywhere: up the walls, over the clawed ceiling, soaking the killing floor of the bed, and pooling in the dark red puddle where nancy has slipped and fallen.}
<C>__{glen}
<D>__{oh, shit...}
<A>__{nancy wobbles up and sees tina in the center of the ravaged bed. unmistakeably and utterly dead. nancy presses against the wall, then contorts and chokes.}
<C>__{glen }
<P>__{(numb)}
<D>__{i...i'm gonna call the cops }
<A>__{he bursts from the room. tight on nancy. she turns away from the body in repulsion, sticking her head through the shattered window rod lane used for his escape, sucking in the cold night air and moaning.}
