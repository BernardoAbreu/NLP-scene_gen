<A>__{thamo and lobsang sit inside a idreljam" a rough palanquin, which is attached to two poles and carried between two mules. the vehicle rises and falls, pitches and twists as it is carried along the roadless, tibetan plains. lhamo reaches forward and pulls back a curtain.}

<A>__{the boy is traveling with a caravan. it is not, in fact, an enormous caravan, maybe fifty people, including: lhamo's family, members of the search party, monks, muslim traders. the dreljam driver looks over at lhamo and signals that the boy should close the curtain. lhamo does so, only to lean across his brother to look out the other side of his tiny carriage. the other side opens to a view of the great, empty land. a herd of deer grazes beside the travelers. mountains rise in the distance. a flock of geese flies overhead. lhamo closes the curtain.}
