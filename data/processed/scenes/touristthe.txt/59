<A>__{frank lies huddled on his back in the awning behind the leather shop, barely able to control his frantic breathing. he's mere feet away from the men who are trying to kill him... he looks up and sees: the scowling face of an italian woman peering out over her window box. frank raises a desperate finger to his lips. a prayer that she won't give him away. she looks at him disapprovingly. then disappears back inside. close on frank as he waits, his heart pounding. seconds tick past... is he safe? rrrrrip! a black cylinder, like the barrel of a gun, tears through the awning fabric inches from his frank's head. he cries out. the awning rips and dumps him down hard onto the cobblestones below...}
