<D>__{no. we'll take them ourselves.}
<A>__{inside the computerized weapons bay the gunner hunches over his tracking screen. rambo's huey is a shimmering blob weaving behind a targeting reticle. the ranging radar emits a rhythmic pinging which increases in frequency.}
<L>__{exterior soviet copter}
<A>__{two air to air rockets flash from support pylons on the stub wings and roar toward the huey two hundred meters ahead.}
<B>__{angle on huey}
<A>__{as the rockets skim past, missing only barely, to explode in the jungle. over rambo's shoulder through the front canopy, as the huey flies through the rising fireballs. rambo sees what he needs, a narrow river, a tributary of the ca, slicing through the rain forest. the soviet juggernaut is gaining as rambo dives his gunship "onto the deck," tearing down through an opening in the trees and skimming over the surface of the river. the soviet craft can't follow. the enormous trees form a canyon, the walls of which overhang the river. rambo is actually zig zagging beneath the jungle canopy in places. they flash in and out of dense shadows. the landing skids throw up spurts of muddy water as the huey banks. two more rockets arrow toward them. one explodes in a tree above. the other flashes past. hits the river ahead. they fly through a wall of spray. brewer gives his rebel yell.}

<D>__{pretty low. couple of seconds worth.}
<A>__{rambo is plugged into some insane second sight, knowing the curves before they curve. he flies with absolute concentration.}
