<L>__{interior bridge salvage barge day}
<A>__{we're back in bond land: a high tech control room, with lots of monitors and white suited technicians. bond and wade are pushed through the door, followed by taro and the two goons.}
<C>__{taro}
<D>__{here they are, captain.}
<A>__{the "captain" turns from a monitor: it's sidney.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{just give me one goad reason mister bond, from lloyds of london why i shouldn't kill both of you, burn your boat, and use your bodies for shark bait.}
<C>__{wade}
<P>__{(chirping up)}
<D>__{so you two know each other!?! small world, ain't it? what happened? commitment problems?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{who is he?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{sidney winch, meet }
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{jack wade. citibank. commercial loan division. if you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat }
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{ shut up!}
<C>__{bond}
<P>__{(to wade)}
<D>__{you have to excuse miss winch: she thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...}
<P>__{(pauses)}
<D>__{...but she won't kill us.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{no. first, because i don't think it's in your nature. and second, because there's no gold down there.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{so charming! so suave!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{don't insult me. i'm not one of your 'little london girls' who falls for the lies.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{so it was commitment!}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{every wharf rat from here to hong kong knows what's on that boat and i'm claiming it. one third of that gold is mine.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{that's fine, but even a little london girl knows that one third of nothing is still nothing.}
<A>__{there's a flicker of doubt in her eyes. she turns to taro:}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{was he carrying anything?}
<A>__{taro holds up the bond's diving belt, indicating 'nothing'. angrily:}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{search him.}
<A>__{the men look at bond wearing only swim trunks. nobody moves.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{do i have to do everything around here?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i hope so.}
<A>__{frowning, sidney moves to bond. as she reaches into his trunks, we cut to their faces. their eyes are locked on each other:}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i hope you'll be gentle.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{think about mom.}
<A>__{bond winces. she's goosed him.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{... unusual technique.}
<A>__{returning to the wide shot, she opens the sack. shows the gold:}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{and what do you call this?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{ the family jewels?}
<A>__{she scowls, takes out the uranium tooth. looks at it, blankly, and holds it out to a technician, who examines it.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{...i don't know. i'm not sure }
<A>__{just then, a crewman bursts in:}
<C>__{crewman}
<D>__{boss! we got company comin' up off the starboard bow!}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(exiting, to taro)}
<D>__{bring them.}
<A>__{taro motions with his uzi for bond and wade to follow... but bond hesitates, looking back at the technician with the uranium.}
