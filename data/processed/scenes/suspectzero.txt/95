<L>__{interior a hospital room morning}
<A>__{mackelway's head is ringing. feels like he can hear electricity in the walls around him. slowly, he awakens. above him are fluorescent lights. monitors blink... fran is here. so's charlton. mackelway tries to sit up. the shock of pain from his chest stops him.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{how ya doin'?}
<A>__{mackelway half nods. his chest is bandaged.}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{we're gonna need everything you can remember about this guy, tom. physical description, any kind of distinguishing characteristics.}
<A>__{that was terse. charlton looks pretty pissed off.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<P>__{(scratchy)}
<D>__{where is he?}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{the suspect fled. couple janitors walked in on it.}
<P>__{(before mack can ask:)}
<C>__{charlton }
<D>__{they're fine. but the description they gave of him wasn't worth a damn.}
<A>__{mackelway nods.}
<C>__{charlton }
<D>__{case you're curious the real professor daitz is on sabbatical, out of the country. we can't find him.}
<P>__{(mackelway nods)}
<D>__{whose idea was it to meet there?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{his, sir.}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{uh huh. did he ask you to come alone?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{but you figured you'd get a bigger pat on the head if you wrapped this whole thing up without any help is that it?}
<A>__{the truth? charlton has him pegged. but:}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{sir, i'm the one who took the call. agent mackelway was acting under the assumption that i'd already checked the guy out. we're both to blame.}
<A>__{hold it. that was a major exaggeration, if not an outright lie. mackelway eyes her, thrown. she's poker faced. charlton, however, seems unmoved...}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{did agent mackelway attend the interview unaccompanied?}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{then whose fuck up is it?}
<A>__{mackelway eyes her: "thanks for trying." she nods.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<P>__{(at charlton)}
<D>__{it was... poor judgment, sir.}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{you wanna work alone, start your own agency.}
<A>__{mackelway can do nothing but nod. then, bailing him out, another composite artist enters, tools in hand. charlton sighs, frustrated.}
<C>__{charlton }
<P>__{(re: composite artist)}
<D>__{let's get you two started.}
<A>__{composite artist is ready to begin...}
