<D>__{colonel kurtz, i guess.}
<C>__{kurtz}
<D>__{i'm kurtz.}
<C>__{willard}
<P>__{(he salutes)}
<D>__{captain b.l. willard reporting his presence, sir.}

<A>__{looking at him a long time. then he returns the salute, and simply:}
<C>__{kurtz}
<D>__{at ease...}
<P>__{(pause, as he regards him)}
<D>__{sit down.}

<A>__{there is, of course, no chair or anything like a chair. but behind and around him, kurtz's men begin to sit on the ground, cross legged. finally, willard sits as well. then kurtz does. moonby lights a joint, and passes it respectfully to kurtz throughout the scene, the joint is passed from man to man, ritualistically.}
<C>__{kurtz}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{why did you come to ... my province.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{we were attacked down river. we need supplies and medical help.}
<C>__{kurtz}
<D>__{you were not coming here, to see me?}
<C>__{willard}
<P>__{(finding it more and}
<D>__{more difficult to go}

<D>__{no no, sir.}
<C>__{kurtz}
<D>__{you came up my river in that small boat. so simple. i always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you are the final justice, aren't you?}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{what do you mean, colonel?}
<C>__{kurtz}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{what other reason could you have come? a captain. ranger. paratrooper. graduate of the recondo school. am i right about these things?}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{you know you're right.}
<A>__{there is a clear, incredible intelligence about this man.}
<C>__{kurtz}
<D>__{then the agency approached you. maybe in a bar in quinon or pleiku. simple. a year's pay for one life. perhaps a village elder, or a tax collector. nobody's orders but your own. exciting work.}
