<A>__{the door is open as guido enters. he's confused, worried that luisa has gone, perhaps. but then he sees a figure moving about in the dressing room, emptying a closet.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{darling?}
<A>__{dante appears, stuffing guido's things into a suitcase.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{we're going back to rome.}
<C>__{guido}
<P>__{(anxious)}
<D>__{where's luisa?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{luisa? she's gone. she's had it with you.}
<P>__{(different tone)}
<D>__{and quite frankly, so have i. you drag a whole crew up here and then you just disappear.}
<C>__{dante }
<D>__{i can't protect you anymore. and claudia is in rome. makeup tests start today. remember?}
<C>__{guido}
<P>__{(sits)}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{you can't. you must. don't sit down.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{i need help.}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(still packing)}
<D>__{you've had help. you've seen the doctors, you've seen the priests, you've taken the cure.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{i'm not cured.}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(decisive, no arguments)}
<D>__{that's enough! the movie calls, your star has landed. fausto take his things please.}
<A>__{dante walks over to the door with the suitcase, passing fausto. a bellboy and a luggage cart stand in the hall.}
<C>__{dante }
<P>__{(impatient, at the door)}
<D>__{guido! andiamo!}
