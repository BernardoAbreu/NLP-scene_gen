<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{(note: we have to invent some brief scene to indicate that three days have gone by. from this we)}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{the butler opens the door. swana enters, her manner showing her complete familiarity with the place.}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{good morning, your highness.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{good morning, gaston.}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{count d'algout is still asleep.}
<C>__{swana}
<P>__{(as she walks toward leon's room)}
<D>__{that's all right.}
<A>__{leon's bedroom the curtains are drawn. the night light is still on. leon, a dressing gown over his pajamas, is sound asleep in a big arm chair. as swana enters, she sees him with some alarm.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{leon! what in heaven's name...!}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{is anything wrong? are you ill?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i just couldn't sleep. i got up and went back... and then got up again. these last few days... whew!}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. much as i'd love to rob the bolsheviks of their filthy money, i won't do it at the expense of your health. particularly as we know we won't get much.}
<P>__{(tenderly)}
<D>__{you look so pale... pale but interesting.}
<A>__{there is a knock at the door.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{gaston enters with a breakfast tray.}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{your breakfast, monsieur.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i don't feel like any breakfast.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{nonsense. how can you fight the reds and make yourself agreeable to the whites if you don't keep up your strength.}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{shall i draw your bath, sir?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{make it ice cold.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{not in your condition.}
<P>__{(to gaston)}
<D>__{make it tepid, gaston... tepid and tender. and lay out his gray suit.}
<P>__{(to leon)}
<D>__{afterwards i will drive you through the bois. slowly... in waltz time.}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{a blue shirt, perhaps?}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{blue? let's offset his mood. find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{very well, your highness.}
<A>__{gaston disappears into the bath dressing room. swana makes leon sit down and seats herself beside him.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{now... here we have two very handsome soft boiled eggs. do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? probably not. they have such unfeeling eyes. we'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... darling, i haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy two hours!}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(irritably)}
<D>__{oh, please, swana! i don't know whether i'm standing on my head or my heels. here you are blaming me for neglecting you when i'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{you haven't seen her yet?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{no, and believe me i've tried everything! i must have telephoned her a hundred times. i've sent her telegrams, i've sent her flowers... i asked her to dinner... i offered her seats for the opera...}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{that proletarian! in the old days we'd have had her flogged.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{that wouldn't have done any good. not with her.}
<P>__{(forgetting himself)}
<D>__{she's the most incredible creature i've ever seen.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{you just told me you hadn't seen her.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{well... er... i caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{imagine the carpets of a self respecting parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! what does she look like?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{you can't imagine.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{that bad?}
<P>__{(leon nods)}
<D>__{old or young?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{timeless. when she comes into a room you'd think that the bolsheviks had taken over paris. she wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by schiaparelli. what a woman! what a woman! there is a russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{you saw all that in one glimpse?}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open!}
<P>__{(he walks over to the bathroom)}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let gaston shave you.}
<A>__{leon exits into the bathroom. as he does so a bell rings.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{gaston!}
<A>__{there is no answer. after a slight pause she herself goes to answer the bell.}
