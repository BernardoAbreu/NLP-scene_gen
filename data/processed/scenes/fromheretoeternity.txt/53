<L>__{exterior kuhio park night}
<B>__{medium shot park bench}
<A>__{karen sits on the bench, her ankles crosses primly, very ill at ease. there is payday activity here also; amorous strolling couples; men in ones and twos looking for pickups. several unattached men pass karen, ogle her. she is about to get up and leave when warden comes into shot, stands over her. his civilian suit is neat and well cut. both are strained, awkward, antagonistic. now that the step has been taken they are not at all sure it was a clever one.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{why, hello. i didn't think you were coming.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{why not? i'm not late.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no, i guess you're not. but then i came a little early. i must have been overanxious. you weren't overanxious though, were you? you got here right on the dot.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{maybe i'd of been early too only i stopped to get a drink.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you certainly chose a savory spot for our meeting.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{would you rather it'd been the cocktail lounge of the royal?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no, but i've had five chances to be picked up in the last few minutes.}
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(sits beside her on the bench)}
<D>__{that's par for the course around here.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{well, i don't care for it. i never went in much for back alley loving.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{didn't you?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you probably think i'm a tramp, don't you?}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{what makes you think i'd think that?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{don't try to be gallant, sergeant. if you think this is a mistake, come right out and say so.}
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(outrage)}
<D>__{listen, what started all this, anyway? why'm i shakin inside like a school kid out with teacher! where'd i come up with a yen for of all things the compny commander's wife! and her actin like lady astor's horse all because i only got here on time!}
<A>__{warden's burst shatters the tension. karen breaks into laughter. after a moment, warden joins in.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{on the other hand, i've got a bathing suit under my dress.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{funny. i got one in a u drive it parked around the corner.}
<A>__{he takes her hand. they rise and walk away, backs to camera. they merge with the other couples in the little park.}
