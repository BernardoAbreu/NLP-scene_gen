<L>__{interior quail's office day}
<A>__{quail is seated at a computer console in a vast beehive of a room. numerous people are typing information onto the screens. quail pauses in his typing, thoughtful. he then types in a little more information, then pauses again. on the screen, a sentence types itself... why have you stopped? request more information. quail read it and continues.}
<L>__{interior mcclane's office rekall day}
<A>__{scene opens on a cu of mcclane, a genial, bubbling, enthus iastic man.}
<D>__{mcclane we're all dreamers, douglas. but here at rekall, dreams are our business.}
<A>__{he presses a button on his desk and the chairs on which they are seated appear to be in outer space. countless stars glitter all around. startlingly, a comet whizzes by. quail is amazed. mcclane grins and presses the button again. the scene changes to a beautiful underwater coral reef. multi colored fish swim around the chairs and desk.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{but... is the process really that effective? a false memory!? mcclane}
<P>__{(shaking his head; smiling)}
<D>__{we prefer the term "extra factual implant". your memory will be complete in every way. you will have gone to mars. we guarantee that.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{is it in any way dangerous? i mean, the medical techniques? mcclane not when you deal with qualified operators like us.}
<A>__{he presses the button again and the normal office returns. quail looks around, impressed.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{it's just incredible. mcclane and look at our follow up program!}
<A>__{he puts items on the desk as he talks.}
<D>__{mcclane}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{space flight ticket stub... passport... vaccination certificates... matchbooks from martian nouvelle cuisine restaurants, souvenirs, post cards... even names of people you met now back there who you can call and discuss your trip with... by the way, we plant these things where you'll come across them at random in the future.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{but... i will know i hired you. that'll destroy the whole illusion. mcclane}
<P>__{(smiling; self satisfied)}
<D>__{but you won't remember me, or having been here.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{i won't? mcclane your money back if you do! we've never paid out yet.}
<A>__{quail slumps backs in his chair, overwhelmed.}
<D>__{mcclane}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and we have a special this month, for only two hundred thousand dollars more.}
<A>__{at the press of a button, a list appears on the wall... a14 millionaire playboy a15 sports hero a16 industrial tycoon a17 intelligence agent}
<D>__{mcclane}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you can have a new identity for the duration of the trip. pick one.}
<A>__{quail's eyes linger on "intelligence agent."}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{"intelligence agent"... wouldn't that be dangerous? i might attack.... mcclane}
<P>__{(airily)}
<D>__{no. no. you're a retired agent. mars was your last mission and you're never to break your cover. but you'll have got the girl, killed the baddies, and saved the universe. not bad, eh?}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{i don't know... about the whole thing... it's all such a fake. i won't really have gone. i won't really.... mcclane}
<P>__{(kind but firm)}
<D>__{let's face it, douglas, you, and millions of people like you have no chance of ever getting to mars and you'd never qualify as a secret agent for eio. this rekall is the only way to achieve your dream.}
<A>__{he gets up and walks around to quail's chair.}
<D>__{mcclane}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{think about it, douglas. think, too, what a terrible boor a real holiday is. lost tickets, endless arguments, lousy hotels, missed connections, rotten weather... rekall will supply you with perfect, happy memories.}
<A>__{quail is thoughtful, willing to be totally convinced.}
