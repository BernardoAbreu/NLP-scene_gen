<A>__{norrington emerges from a gangway and sees his other ship moving away.}
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{sailors! back to the interceptor!}
<A>__{but the distance is already too great. one brave sailor tries to swing across on a rope, errol flynn style, but falls short with a splash. jack waves, and shouts across the distance }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{thank you, commodore, for getting our ship ready to make way! we'd've had a hard time of it by ourselves!}
<A>__{norrington seethes, but his order to gillette is measured:}
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{raise the sails.}
<C>__{gillette}
<D>__{the wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.}
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{we need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.}
<A>__{gillette looks surprised at the order but relays it.}
<C>__{gillette}
<D>__{hands! come about! jackets off the cannons!}
<P>__{(to norrington)}
<D>__{we are to fire on our own ship?}
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.}
<A>__{the steersman turns the wheel. the dauntless' course does not change one whit.}
<C>__{steersman}
<D>__{captain, there's a problem.}
<A>__{the steersman spins the wheel. it goes round and round, with no signs of slowing.}
<C>__{steersman }
<D>__{he's disabled the rudder chain, sir.}
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{so it would seem.}
<A>__{the interceptor dwindles with distance. gillette watches it go, with some degree of admiration.}
<C>__{gillette}
<D>__{he's got to be the best pirate i've ever seen.}
<A>__{norrington reaches out, stops the spinning ship's wheel.}
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{so it would seem.}
<A>__{the interceptor makes for the horizon line. a slow dissolve and with the time passage, the ship is gone; the sky turns a deep twilight blue }
