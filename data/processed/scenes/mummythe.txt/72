<A>__{down in the bazaar, people are screaming and quickly backing away from the shriveled corpse of the egyptologist. a partially decayed hand reaches down and takes the sacred canopic jar out of the egyptologist's shriveled hand. it's imhotep, having regenerated even further. he looks up and catches eyes with o'connell. imhotep grins, then unhinges; his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman size, and then a huge swarm of flies comes out of his mouth and races straight up at o'connell and jonathan. they both slam the shutters. the flies slam into the closed window and immediately spread throughout the bazaar. sending people screaming and running. egyptologist's office day for night o'connell and jonathan look at each other, panicked.}
