<L>__{exterior park day}
<A>__{we float down through a serene, leafy park to the children's play area. there, in the sandbox, a beautiful five year old girl plays among a group of kids.}
<C>__{gigi }
<D>__{i have a theory about how this all started...}
<A>__{a six year old boy approaches. he watches the little girl for a moment as she gently shapes her sand castle. and then out of nowhere the little boy pushes the}
<B>__{little girl down.}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{why did you do that?}
<C>__{little boy}
<D>__{because you smell like dog poo.}
<A>__{some of the other kids snicker at this brilliant one liner. our little girl's face turns red.}
<C>__{little boy }
<D>__{you're so stupid just like dog poo! you're made of poo!}
<A>__{and then, just to punctuate, he jumps on the sandcastle, smashing it. finally, our little girl starts to cry.}
