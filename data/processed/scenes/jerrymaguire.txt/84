<D>__{why the fuck am i here? i feel like i'm five years late for the prom.}
<A>__{in a look, jerry sizes up the situation. with a hand on tidwell's large shoulder, he smoothly pumps up the big man's ego.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{come on. come with me. we're going to take a walk through this lobby. i want every media guy, every player rep, everybody to see you for what you are. the best kept secret in the nfl. the biggest wide receiver in the game. let 'em see ya, rod. and whatever you do, don't sit down. let 'em see how big you are. you ready? let's do it.}
<A>__{he is privately thrilled, but offers only:}
<C>__{tidwell}
