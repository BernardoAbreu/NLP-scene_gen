<A>__{seq. 2100 tar pit grug chases guy across a trembling landscape.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{this is pointless. we're running out of time. everything is collapsing. you're being irrational and counterproductive.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{big words anger me. keep talking.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{countermeasures.}
<A>__{belt throws fruit at grug. the fruit hits grug square in the face. he's blinded. he doesn't stop.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{remember how you were this morning? you changed, remember? idea man? modern man?}
<A>__{guy comes to a sudden stop he's stepped in a small puddle of tar. grug wipes his eyes clean of fruit.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{i... am... a... caveman.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{no, no, no wait.}
<A>__{guy and grug do a slow motion plunge over a tar fall. as they descend grug swings at guy, coating himself with tar. grug's arms are held like glue. his punches stop well short of guy's face. guy and grug arrive in a wide pool of tar. they sink slowly.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{hnnnnnngh! no. what is this stuff that saves you from my punches?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(hollow)}
<D>__{tar.}
<A>__{the tone of guy's voice sinks in. grug ceases his attack.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{please grug. you have to stop struggling.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{no. i have to get back to them.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{grug! stop!}
<A>__{grug looks to guy.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{no one gets out of this. believe me. i know.}
<A>__{grug gets it.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{your...?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{family. yeah.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{grug looks at guy again he needs more than that. guy takes a deep breath this is going to be hard.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i was little when it happened. the last thing my parents told me was, "don't hide. live. follow the sun. you'll make it to tomorrow."}
<A>__{this resonates with grug. a thread of light trickles through the storm, falling just near enough to guy he can gather it in his palm.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{you followed the light. my daughter is a lot like you.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{no. she's like you. she loves you but always forgets to say it. just like you forget to tell her.}
<A>__{grug ponders this. a change comes over grug. he focuses on guy. this hits grug hard.}
<C>__{grug}
<P>__{(crushed)}
<D>__{i guess i was just busy keeping them all alive.}
<A>__{guy considers grug.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{it's okay. that's what dads do.}
<A>__{grug smiles. he regards guy in a different light. he sees him not as a boy but a man. someone good enough for his little girl.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{that's right... but we can't do that from here. we need one of your ideas.}
<A>__{the music turns.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{come on. you can do it.}
<A>__{buoyed by grug's encouragement, guy swings into action mode.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{belt! emergency idea generator, activate!}
<A>__{belt hits guy in the head with a rock.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{ow!}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i've got it!}
