<L>__{exterior rodney's wunderland fire pit night}
<A>__{someone (buddy) is filming a raging party consisting of a lot of strung out young white trash junkies just like the ones jimmy was interviewing before. it's certainly a weird bunch. they all look alike, dress similar, and have the same type of crystal methamphetamine induced facial expressions. most of them are smoking weed and drinking forty ounce beers while dancing around a campfire and playing the bongo drums. they all seem to be having more fun than anyone should be allowed. camera pans to jimmy, so we realize that he's not filming. our best guess would be that it's buddy who's filming. jimmy screams at the camera over the noise of the bongo drums.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{where's judy?}
<A>__{buddy's hand comes into frame as he points by the fire pit. we now see jimmy see judy. she dances fervently drinking a forty surrounded by tons of other drunk, happily intoxicated teenagers. say what you might about the attendees to the event, this party is a fucking rager and judy is happy to be the center of everyone's attention. everyone dances faster and faster as the rhythm of drums beat faster and become more intense. it's an all out jam session. jimmy heads to the center of the circle of people dancing around judy. camera follows him with a zoom as he does.}
<B>__{jump cut}
<A>__{who knows how much later. minutes or hours, the party rages forward. the camera spins around. the party has reached a new level of drunken absurdity. most of those who are dancing are drunk, stoned or both. in the background, while it's too dark and hectic see anything explicit, some of the teenagers are engaged in a variety of sexual activity. some have threesomes. some are probably having oral sex. still others dance around them in the foreground. camera zooms in on uncle rodney. standing just behind him, we see of flash of someone recognizable. it's a skinny woman, she looks vaguely familiar, but it's hard to get a fix with all the craziness going on. she turns her head to look over at rodney. now we can clearly see that this person is... hazel with her eyes wide and clearly in the height of rolling on crank. and she's saying something to uncle rodney that's definitely pissing him off. bodies wipe the frame.}
<B>__{jump cut}
<A>__{moments later. camera catches judy who hasn't missed a step along the way to being a high, drunken mess. the rhythm of the drum beats is ever present. uncle rodney comes up behind her and wraps his arms around her shoulder, saying something to her, but we can't hear it over the noise. jimmy approaches and they start talking. jimmy doesn't notice, but there are about four or five of the kids, especially a couple of rodney's bigger guys standing not too far behind uncle rodney watching the conversation intensely. it's really difficult to put your finger on it exactly, but something doesn't seem right here. uncle rodney lets go of judy and puts his arm around jimmy. with the noise of the drums and the fact that we're zoomed in from a distance, we can't hear anything they're saying. now uncle rodney and jimmy are having a conversation as they move towards the camera. though jimmy can't see it, we can see that rodney's bigger guys, the ones that were standing behind uncle rodney are now pushing judy along behind jimmy and rodney. though uncle rodney seems to be having a very light and friendly conversation with jimmy, we continue to get the feeling that something ominous is afoot. finally, they approach camera and we can hear them.}
<C>__{uncle rodney}
<D>__{i'm so glad you guys came down here. we never would have guessed you'd come and see us.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{you've been awesome. judy loves it here.}
<A>__{uncle rodney's got jimmy in an incredibly friendly one armed side hug.}
<C>__{uncle rodney}
<D>__{i knew she would. by the way.}
<A>__{rodney's face drops.}
<C>__{uncle rodney}
<D>__{i know what you did to dinko.}
<A>__{this hits jimmy like a lead weight. before he can react at all, and before he realizes that anything is happening, jimmy is suddenly thrown into a headlock by uncle rodney. off camera, something similar is happening to judy.}
<C>__{judy }
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{what the fuck are you doing?! jimmy, jimmy!}
<A>__{judy screams his name over and over.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{jimmy! jimmy!}
<C>__{buddy }
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{shut it, bitch!}
<A>__{smack! judy's been hit by buddy off screen. camera shuts down.}
