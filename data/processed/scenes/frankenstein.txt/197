<L>__{int walton's cabin night}
<A>__{walton enters... and freezes at the sound of soft weeping. he can't see the bad from here. could it be the dead man? he glances down. wet footprints lead across the floor. he eases forward. the tiny bed chamber comes slowly into view. a dark figure is hunched and weeping at bedside, holding the corpse's hand. walton is stunned.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{the figure swivels its head, revealing its face to the dim yellow light:}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{he never gave me a name.}
<A>__{walton hisses a terrified intake of breath. he lunges to the desk, slaps his hand on the pistol lying there. a frozen beat. wondering if he should snatch it up. eyes dancing with fear and speculation. the creature makes no move. unconcerned.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{you were with him at the end.}
<C>__{walton}
<P>__{(finds his voice)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{i was watching.}
<A>__{walton glances to the porthole, ajar and creaking in the breeze, chilled at the thought. the creature returns his gaze to victor.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{i longed to be with him. but i wanted his final moments to have peace. i could see you were a friend to him.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{what is that to you? evil as you are.}
<C>__{creature}
<P>__{(swivels his gaze)}
<D>__{i am as he made me. in his own image.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{you drove him to his torment.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{and he drove me to mine.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{then why weep for him?}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{would you not? he was father. and mother. we fell from grace together. he from his god. i from mine.}
<A>__{the creature gently strokes victor's cheek. he reaches up with two fingers, closes the staring eyes. a whisper:}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{could we ever have forgiven?}
<A>__{the question goes unanswered. the creature rises, gliding in shadow to the door. pauses.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{i've never been shown a kindness. show me one now.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{what kindness?}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{build for him a pyre. light up the sky with his passing.}
<A>__{and then the creature is gone, vanishing smoothly into the night...}
