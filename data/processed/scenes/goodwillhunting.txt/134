<L>__{interior lambeau's office day}
<A>__{tom and will are sitting waiting for lambeau.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{!!! !}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{!!! !}
<A>__{lambeau enters going over a thick proof will has completed.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{this is correct. i see you used mclullen here }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i don't know what it's called.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{ this can't be right.}
<P>__{(examining proof)}
<D>__{this is going to be very embarrassing. have you ever considered }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i'm pretty sure it's right.}
<A>__{will gets up to leave.}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(turning back)}
<D>__{can i ask you a favor, can we do this at sean's from now on? 'cause i leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me }
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{that's fine, but did you ever think }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{it's right.}
<P>__{(a beat, heading out)}
<D>__{take it home with you.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{will, what happened at the tri tech meeting?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i couldn't go 'cause i had a date. so i sent my chief negotiator.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{will, on your own time, you can do what you like. when i set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{then don't set up any more meetings.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{i will cancel every meeting right now. i will give you a job myself. i just wanted you to see what was out there.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{maybe i don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{the least you can do is show me a little appreciation.}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(indicates proof)}
<D>__{you know how fuckin' easy this is to me? this is a joke!}
<P>__{(crumples proof)}
<D>__{and i'm sorry you can't do this. i really am. 'cause if you could i wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. think of how many fights you could have been in by now.}
<A>__{will turns around reveling that he's lit the proof on fire. will drops it on the floor. lambeau drops to his knees and puts it out. he looks up at will.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{you're right, will. i can't do that proof and you can. and when it comes to this there are only twenty people in the world that can tell the difference between you and me. but i'm one of them.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{well, i'm sorry.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{so am i.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{yes. that's right, will. most days i wish i never met you. because then i could sleep at night. i wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. and i wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away.}
<A>__{lambeau gathers his composure and calmly walks over to the wrinkled proof. he picks it up, smooths it out.}
