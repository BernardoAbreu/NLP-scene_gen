<A>__{she walks around back and looks underneath the trailer: a mass of charred and melted insulation.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{look at this. we can't live here anymore!}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{it's just a tin crapper.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{no, it was our house.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{so, we're gettin' a new one, right?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{jesus, you could have killed yourself and your brother.}
<A>__{she grabs the blowtorch and slams it to the ground, but it is indestructible.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{it's not yours, he gave it to me.}
<A>__{she goes to the car, takes out her gun then puts the blow torch on the ground and aims at it but t.j. grabs it.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{put it down.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{put it down.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{are you gonna shoot me now, too?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{put that thing down!}
<A>__{he ignites the blow torch to spite her.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{maybe he didn't like gettin' shot in his own house. maybe that's why he left.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{that was an accident.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{some accident you shot him in the foot.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{he spent the food money on scratch cards, t.j.}
<C>__{t.j.}

<A>__{she tries to grab it out of his hand, but he is too strong.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{t.j. come on now.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{you can't have it. it's mine.}
<A>__{his eyes fill with tears, but his face stays tight. she grabs at it again, but he jerks it away. she pauses and stares at him.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{he was clean for 23 months.}
<A>__{they look at one another.}
<C>__{ray }
<P>__{(chokes back tears)}
<D>__{i didn't know how else to keep us together. i mean...he's a good dad when he's not gamblin'.}
<A>__{he cuts off the blow torch.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{yeah, awesome dad. robs us and takes off a week before christmas.}
<A>__{she walks up to him and wipes a tear from the side of his face. he shakes it off. they stand in the cold air for a long moment their breath visible. she touches his hair.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i know.}
