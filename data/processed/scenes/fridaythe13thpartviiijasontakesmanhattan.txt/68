<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but i'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do.}
<A>__{he's made a big decision. sean takes her hand as they walk on.}
<B>__{their point of view}
<A>__{moving closer and closer to the bridge door, having not the slightest inclination of what's in store for them.}
<B>__{sean}
