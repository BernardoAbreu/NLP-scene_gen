<A>__{a cat bats at a ball of paper. on it, two words are visible: dear liz. hellboy's tail scoops up the paper and throws it in a brimming wastebasket. he's sitting at a stainless steel desk, deep in concentration, writing with evident difficulty. the floor around him is covered with more crumpled pages. in the background, the projector is showing duck soup. myers pushes in a cartload of chili.}
