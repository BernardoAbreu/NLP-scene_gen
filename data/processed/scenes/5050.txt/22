<L>__{exterior mount sinai hospital later}
<A>__{adam enters the hospital...}
<L>__{interior hospital. examining room later}
<A>__{adam leafs through a pamphlet on incontinence. the pedantic dr. ross enters and completely ignores adam. instead, he looks over adam's chart, examines his mri scans, and pulls out a dictaphone }
<C>__{dr. ross}
<P>__{(into the dictaphone)}
<D>__{patient has been complaining of excessive urination, back pain, and night sweats. blood tests and urine analysis are normal. mri indicates a massive intraduaral extradural}
<C>__{malignant schwannoma}
<D>__{neurofibrosarcomas extending into psoas muscle with nerve root compression syndrome and bone erosion.}
<A>__{we see adam's face gradually look more and more confused, he slowly begins to raise his arm as if to ask a question.}
<C>__{dr. ross }
<D>__{growth extends from the l2 to l5. cytotoxic antibiotics are recommended.}
<A>__{dr. ross turns to see adam holding his arm in the air.}
<C>__{dr. ross }
<D>__{yes. questions?}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(dumbfounded)}
<D>__{i have no idea what you just said. is there something wrong with me?}
<C>__{dr. ross}
<P>__{(points to mri)}
<D>__{if you look here on your mri, you see this cephalopod like object spreading down along your spinal column?}
<A>__{adam squints. it all looks the same.}
<C>__{dr. ross }
<D>__{that is a massive schwannoma neurofibrosarcomas.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i still have no idea what you're talking about.}
<C>__{dr. ross}
<D>__{it's a malignant tumor.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what?!...a tumor? no.}
<C>__{dr. ross}
<D>__{i'm afraid so.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{how is that possible?...i don't smoke. i don't drink. i eat healthy...i even recycle.}
<C>__{dr. ross}
<D>__{well adam it's actually quite fascinating. your cancer is the result of an incredibly rare gene mutation in chromosome 17p in the p53 gene that causes the growth of malignant cells in tissue around the nerves. in your case it's grown along the nerves in your lower spine.}
<A>__{adam looks at himself in the mirror.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(still in denial)}
<D>__{but, look at me. i don't look sick.}
<C>__{dr. ross}
<D>__{cancer often has no specific symptoms. people can go years with out knowing they're sick. we're lucky we caught it before it metastasizes.}
<C>__{dr. ross }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm going to put you on a 4 month regimen of chemotherapy. it's an aggressive dosage so you might want to think about taking some time off from work.}
<A>__{this is real. adam walks to the window and presses his face against the glass. he looks down at the city below. from 15 stories up, the people on the street look like miniature figurines. adam turns back to dr. ross.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{can't you just cut it out of me?}
<C>__{dr. ross}
<D>__{yes, that is an option. but because the tumor has spread to a such significant size. cutting it out now would be risky.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{well what are my chances of beating this?}
<A>__{dr. ross puts on his best act of reassurance. his words are seemingly genuine, his tone is anything but.}
<D>__{dr. ross listen, you're in good hands. the best thing for you to do right now is to not worry...let me do the worrying. alright?}
<A>__{dr. ross takes a long look at adam's devastated face.}
<C>__{dr. ross }
<D>__{maybe you should talk to someone.}
<A>__{dr. ross hands adam a business card for the "mount sinai psychology group".}
<C>__{dr. ross }
<D>__{we have a whole department of psychologists here in the hospital. they specialize in cases...in these...sort of matters. they'll be able to help you.}
<A>__{not knowing what else to say, dr. ross looks at his watch, looks back to adam, and moves to the door.}
<C>__{dr. ross }
<D>__{hang in there champ.}
