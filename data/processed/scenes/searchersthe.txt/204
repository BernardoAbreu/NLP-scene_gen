<A>__{she is giving him an appraising once over, then signals the musicians to play. she rests her buttocks against a table and waits, her eyes challenging martin to make a move. emilio is watching estrella and martin with something akin to bored amusement.}

<A>__{ethan has poured a drink for mose, now one for himself leaving martin's glass empty.}
<C>__{mose}
<D>__{i been helpin' ye, ethan... i been lookin' all the time...}
<A>__{martin turns back to the bar to take his glass. he finds it empty.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(to ethan's back)}
<D>__{thanks for nothin'...}
<A>__{he angrily throws a coin on the counter, appropriates the bottle and his glass and heads for a table closer to estrella. neither ethan nor mose seems aware of his going.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{well, the reward still stands...}
<C>__{mose}
<D>__{don't want no money, ethan... jus' a place a roof over m' head... a little grub... a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...}

<D>__{you help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...}
<C>__{mose}
<D>__{swear it, ethan?... given word?}

<P>__{(impressively)}
<D>__{ethan... i found a man's seen her... knows where little debbie is!}
<A>__{ethan stares at him. mose nods his reaffirmation of it. then ethan's hand locks on the old man's shoulder.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{who? where is he... this man?}
<A>__{mose winces under the grip. he can't speak, but he looks past ethan and he points. ethan turns. emilio swings his boots off the table and slowly crosses to them. he lets cigarette smoke curl out of his mouth. then he smiles.}

<D>__{i am this man, senor... emilio gabriel fernandez y figueroa... at your service...}
<P>__{(afterthought)}
<D>__{...for a price...}
<P>__{(he smiles)}
<D>__{...always for a price...}
<A>__{as the men study each other, estrella begins her dance and the rhythmic click of the castanets will beat like a metronome. emilio looks at the bottle on the bar, disdainfully pushes it away and imperiously signals the proprietor to bring something better.}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{un otra!}
