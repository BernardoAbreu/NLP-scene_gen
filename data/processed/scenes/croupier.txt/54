<A>__{jack comes into the gents, another smoke filled room. three or four men are arguing over a drug deal, standing in front of the urinal. one of them has an envelope full of cash, another a packet of drugs. jack goes to a lavatory stall, opens the door. in the stall the fair haired man who was at matt's table is sitting on the lavatory, his trousers round his ankles. the girl in the bathing suit is sitting on his thighs, bobbing up and down. jack sees a butterfly tattoo on her left cheek, the queen of spades.}
