<L>__{interior kathleen's store day}
<A>__{kathleen is sitting on a stool reading to a group of children, including annabel and matt, who are crammed into her store. joe is watching, along with some parents as kathleen reads from a roald dahl book.}
<L>__{interior kathleen's store later}
<A>__{matt is sitting on the floor reading a book. kathleen is showing annabel a copy of a book called betsy tacy.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{this is her best friend tacy, whose real name is anastasia, and then in the next book betsy and tacy become friends with tib, whose real name, i am sorry to tell you, is thelma.}
<A>__{in another section of the store: george is showing joe a first edition of swiss family robinson from the glass case.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{the illustrations are hand tipped, which is why }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{it costs so much.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it's why it's worth so much.}
<A>__{joe smiles and turns to see kathleen and annabel at a whole shelf of betsy tacy books.}
<C>__{annabel}
<D>__{i want all of them.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{that might be an awful lot for your dad to buy at one time.}
<C>__{annabel}
<D>__{my dad gets me all the books i want.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<P>__{(looking over at joe)}
<D>__{well, that's very nice of him.}
<C>__{annabel}
<D>__{that's not my dad. that's my nephew }
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{oh, i don't really think that's your nephew }
<A>__{as joe approaches.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{it's true. annabel is my aunt. aren't you, aunt annabel?}
<A>__{annabel nods solemnly.}
<C>__{annabel}
<D>__{and matt is }
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{let me guess.}
<P>__{(to matt)}
<D>__{are you his uncle?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{his grandfather?}
<A>__{annabel and matt start giggling.}
<C>__{kathleen }
<D>__{his great grandfather?}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(shouting with glee)}
<D>__{i'm his brother.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{annabel is my grandfather's daughter. and matt is my father's son. we are an american family.}
<A>__{he smiles at kathleen, who finds herself smiling back. annabel suddenly sneezes. kathleen takes a handkerchief from her sleeve. it's an old fashioned hankie that's embroidered. she offers it to annabel, who instead wipes her nose with her hand and then looks at the handkerchief, a little puzzled.}
<C>__{annabel}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{a handkerchief. oh my, do children not even know what handkerchiefs are? a handkerchief is a kleenex you don't throw away. my mother embroidered it for me you see? my initials and a daisy, because daisies are my favorite flower.}
<C>__{annabel}
<D>__{orchids are my favorite flower.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<P>__{(to joe)}
<D>__{you know what else children don't know? they don't know what a telephone booth is?}
<A>__{joe is looking at kathleen.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{kathleen kelly. i own this store. are you are?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{joe. just call me joe.}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{we'll take these books.}
<A>__{he gets the one matt is reading. and the two other kathleen has gotten for annabel.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{these are wonderful books. as annabel gets older the characters in the books do, too.}
<P>__{(to annabel)}
<D>__{you can grow up with betsy.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you're going to come back again, aren't you?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{this is why we're never going to go under. our customers are loyal.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<P>__{(by way of explanation)}
<D>__{they're opening a foxbooks around the corner.}
<C>__{annabel}
<D>__{foxbooks! my daddy }
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(gently putting his hand over her mouth)}
<D>__{ likes to buy at discount. don't tell anyone that, annabel, it's nothing to be proud of }
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(spelling)}
<D>__{f o x.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{that's amazing. you can spell fox. can you spell dog?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{f o x.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{matt, look at this dinosaur book. wouldn't you like a dinosaur book? annabel, maybe you could read this to matt while i wrap things up here.}
<P>__{(moves them to a corner, to them quickly)}
<D>__{sit down, read, and don't listen to anything i say.}
<A>__{returns to counter and gives kathleen some cash.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{and the dinosaur book too.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{the world is not driven by discounts, believe me. i've been in business forever. i started helping my mother here after school when i was six years old. i used to watch her, and it wasn't that she was selling books, it was that she was helping people become whoever they were going to turn out to be. when you read a book as a child it becomes part of your identity in a way that no other reading in your life does.}
<P>__{(stops herself)}
<D>__{i guess i've gotten carried away.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you have, and you've made me feel...}
<A>__{he can't finish the sentence. he looks at her and sees, behind her on the shelf, a picture of a woman who is unmistakably kathleen's mother, with a young kathleen.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{enchanting, your mother was enchanting.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{she was. how did you know that?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{lucky guess.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{anyway. she left the store to me, and i'm going to leave it to my daughter.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{how old is your daughter now?}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{oh, i'm not married. but eventually.}
<A>__{she smiles at joe...}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{so foxbooks can...}
<C>__{kathleen and george together}
<D>__{go to hell.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<P>__{(handing him his books)}
<D>__{here you go.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{we ready?}
<A>__{annabel and matt join him at the counter. kathleen gives them each a lollipop.}
<C>__{annabel}
<D>__{bye, kathleen.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{goodbye, annabel. bye, matt. what about cat? can you spell cat?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{f o x.}
