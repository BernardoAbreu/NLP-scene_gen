<A>__{camera tracks past a pool table where two rats are playing nine ball. they make a few shots, then the phone rings. the camera continues to track past a small table where azul's guitar case lies open. weapons adorn it, with each knife, each gun in its pocket, in its own place. the camera continues tracking to a dresser on which sits azul's cellular phone. a delicate female hand lifts the receiver. the camera is now positioned above the bed as the girl answers the phone.}

<A>__{he rolls over and wakes a girl sleeping beside her. girl #2 takes the phone and passes it to a third girl as girl #2 tries to wake azul (he is sleeping between girls #2 and #3.). girl #3 has the phone to her ear as if listening for background conversation. the two rats playing pool are staring longingly at the three girls in azul's bed. they look hungry and deprived. one hits the other, signaling it's his shot. while one shoots, the other watches. azul awakens and grabs the phone.}
