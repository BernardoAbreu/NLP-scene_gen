<D>__{just can't get away from you guys. escaping for a night on the town, eh?}

<C>__{adlai}
<D>__{gotta keep up appearances. of course, i don't care anymore. i'm a political dead man. you ever seen a man cut his own throat like i did today?}
<A>__{kenny has no answer to that. he looks down, pained for adlai.}
<C>__{adlai }
