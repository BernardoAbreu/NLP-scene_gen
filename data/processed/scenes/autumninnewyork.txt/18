<C>__{celia}
<D>__{look, i have no right to say this, okay? and you can fire me if you want, but in the six weeks we've been open you've brought in six different women tonight makes seven and it's really starting to get to me.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{in what way?}
<C>__{celia}

<D>__{nope. in fact, john's been looking for an assistant. tell him you've just been promoted.}
<A>__{wills smiles, pats her in the shoulder, and moves on. she can't believe it. a waiter carrying a birthday cake blazing with candles and decorated with a woman's hat made of meringue latticework passes by on his way to the rear dining room. from inside, voices begin to sing happy birthday. wills, his curiosity piqued, follows.}
