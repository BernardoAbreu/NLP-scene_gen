<L>__{interior mills' apartment building, stairwell night}
<A>__{mills walks up the creaky stairs. he carries his briefcase, a six pack and art books. somerset follows, reading a case file.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{we think he acted like he was delivering a package. the doorman at mr. gold's building says he doesn't even look at anyone who goes in anymore.}
<A>__{mills opens a door to the roof }
<L>__{exterior mills' apartment building, rooftop night}
<A>__{mills and somerset walk onto the roof. it is a spectacular view on all sides. miles of city lights. breathtaking. sounds of the city reach them.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{no connection between the two victims?}
<A>__{mills shakes his head, unloads what he's holding onto a rusty table. he sits in one of two lawn chairs. somerset sits across from him.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{no witnesses of any kind?}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{none. which i can't understand. it's like this guy's invisible.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{in this city, minding your own business is a perfected science.}
<A>__{somerset takes a picture from the file, the drawing of the sun with an eye at its center. he opens a book, christian symbols, which is full of illustrations. he starts paging through.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{at the precinct, sunday nights, they offer a public crime prevention course. and, the very first thing they teach is that you should never scream "help" if you're in trouble. scream "fire." because people don't want to get caught up in anything. but, a fire... that's entertainment. they come running.}
<A>__{somerset holds the books up to mills, points to a picture of the sun and eye, same as the drawing mills found.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{"the sun in splendor with the eye." it refers to god the father, and to saint thomas aquinas.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{which saint is he?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{aquinas wrote a summary of theology, summa theologica. and he wrote about the seven deadly sins.}
<A>__{mills takes the book and looks it over.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{now, what else have you got?}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{look, i appreciate being able to talk this out, but... it's my case.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{so... satisfying my curiosity. i'm still leaving town on sunday.}
<A>__{mills is pondering, very tired. he unlatches his briefcase, takes a photocopy of the photo of the falsely pretty woman and hands it to somerset.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{the eyes were circled. with mr. gold's blood.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{this is his wife?}
<C>__{mills}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{she was away on business. she got back the day he was killed. if this means she saw anything, i don't know what. we've questioned her about ten times.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{and, if it's a threat?}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{we put her in a safe house.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{this is the one thing.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i know.}
