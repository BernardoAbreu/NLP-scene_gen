<A>__{the song continues. enid sits in her bean bag chair. her hair is now dyed back to black. as the song ends, she picks up the needle and starts it again.}

<D>__{so you really liked it? yeah, there's some really rare performances. you liked that memphis minnie, huh?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "devil got my woman" i mostly just keep playing that one over and over... do you have any other records like that?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{the skip james record? yeah, that's a masterpiece. there are no other records like that! i actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. it's one of maybe five known copies.}
<C>__{enid}
<P>__{(nearly sincere)}
<D>__{wow!}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{do you want to see it? i can run upstairs and get it...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{yeah, sure, i guess...}
<C>__{seymour}

<A>__{seymour returns with the 78, holding it like a precious object.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{here it is. it's only about v minus and has an incipient lam crack, but plays decent as i recall.}
<A>__{seymour passes the 78 to enid who follows suit and holds it carefully by the edges.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{wow...}
<A>__{enid pretends to drop the record.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{oops! i dropped it!}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{no!!!}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{hey, i was only kidding!}
<A>__{she hands the record back to seymour, who's shaken and embarrassed.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{jesus, seymour... are you all right?}
