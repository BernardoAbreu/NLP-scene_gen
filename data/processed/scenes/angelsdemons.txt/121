<A>__{close on a handwritten page, half filled with mathematical computations; the other half with a scratchy handwritten prose. (if we're eagle eyed, we'll notice the phrase we move past just as we cut into the scene is "may his will be done," the same phrase we just heard mortati utter.) commandante rocher is at his desk, vittoria's leather bound journals on the desk in front of him. he's studying them carefully, and seems troubled by what he reads. through the glass walls of his office, we can see a commotion in the still chaotic swiss guard headquarters. someone is walking toward us, briskly, a woman's voice complaining loudly in italian. rocher calmly places the journals on top of the screen of the video monitor inlaid in his desk, the one we saw earlier, with a keyhole where a power switch should be. he pushes a button and the monitor rotates shut, into an inlaid panel in the desk's surface. it closes just after }

<D>__{i demand that you return them to me.}

<D>__{this isn't italy. it isn't even rome. the vatican is its own country, with its own laws, and when those journals crossed our border they became our property. you will get them back when i have decided they contain nothing of value to this investigation.}

<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{do you have something to hide, commandante rocher?}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{do you, doctor vetra?}
<A>__{he stresses her title, as if it offends}
