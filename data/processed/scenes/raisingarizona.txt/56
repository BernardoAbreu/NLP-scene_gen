<A>__{peeling out from in front of the bank.}
<L>__{interior gale and evelle's car}
<A>__{gale is driving; evelle starts pawing through one of the sacks.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{that old timer threw off my concentration. otherwise it would a gone smoother.}
<C>__{evelle}
<D>__{we done okay. yessir. this ought to split nicely three ways.}
<A>__{a thought registers with gale and evelle at the same moment. they look at each other. they both twist frantically to look in the back seat. bellowing:}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{goddamnit! ya never leave a man behind!}
<A>__{ka pop! with a loud flat crack something detonates in the front seat and the interior of the car is spattered with bright blue painterior gale and evelle, both covered in blue, are screaming in rage, fear and incomprehension. blue dollar bills snap and flutter around the inside of the car. the car is swerving wildly as gale drives blind, the inside of the windshield covered with blue painterior he reaches forward to wipe clear a patch of windshield.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{as the blue paint is smeared away we see hi and ed's car parked broadside in the middle of the road. hi and ed are in front of it, hi aiming his scatter gun, ed a revolver. the guns spit orange flame. hi's pov down the barrel of his shotgun. the car with the blue interior is swerving crazily at us, one front tire blown out. hi lets go with the other barrel. the shot chews up the front grill, shatters one headlight and blows out the other front tire. the hood of the car flies open. the car is squealing to a halt and gale and evelle pile out, still bellowing.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{goddamnit h.i., ain't we got enough to contend with?}
<A>__{ed is running over to gale and evelle's car, throwing open the back door to look for the baby but coming out only with dr. spock's baby and child care. evelle is staggering around in shock, looking in disbelief at his own blue body.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{where's the baby?}
<A>__{evelle points this way and that, in a state of confusion.}
<C>__{evelle}
<D>__{i think we left him on the roof of the... he must be back at the...}
<A>__{hi and ed are climbing into their car.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{let us come with you!}
<A>__{hi and ed are already peeling out.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{...he's our baby too!}
<B>__{close on nathan jr.}
<A>__{sitting placidly in his car seat that sits in the middle of the road in front of the bank. we can hear the wail of the police siren still approaching. as we hold on nathan jr. we hear the distant booming of a shotgun. as we boom up to show the empty street beyond the baby, we hear the crack of return fire and furiously squealing brakes. the screech culminates in a loud explosion that snaps off the siren wail. the police car is apparently history. from beyond the crest of the road ahead a ball of flame has leapt up with the explosion. as the explosion echoes and fades we hear the deep rumble of an approaching engine. lenny smalls' motorcycle appears over the rise. framed against fire and smoke, he is coming directly toward us, and the baby.}
<B>__{from behind hi and ed}
<A>__{as they top a rise coming from the other direction. we see the baby sitting in the middle of the street, and lenny fast approaching from the background.}
<B>__{locked down to motorcycle}
<A>__{the extremely low wide shot, locked down to the speeding bike, shows us rushing toward the rear of nathan jr's car seat. with a clank of chains lenny's hand drops down into frame, palm forward, tensing to scoop up the car seat that we are almost upon. a tattoo on lenny's wrist reads "no prisoners."}
<B>__{reverse}
<A>__{low shot with nathan jr. in the foreground. he is scooped up and out of frame as lenny roars by.}
<B>__{on lenny}
<A>__{roaring along. he hooks the car seat over his handlebars. over hi and ed's shoulders lenny is approaching. under her breath:}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{what is he?}
<C>__{hi}
<D>__{...d'you see him too?}
<A>__{lenny is sawing a shotgun out of his back holster and leveling it at the oncoming car. lenny is sighting down the gun, swinging it around as he approaches the car.}
