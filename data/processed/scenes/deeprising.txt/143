<A>__{leila trembles in the waist high water. the pump's heartbeat seems to have gotten louder. ka chunk ka chunk ka chunk. leila slowly starts edging her way around the corpse. ka chunk ka chunk ka chunk ka chunk. her eyes are transfixed, staring at the abomination, too scared to scream. ka chunk ka chunk ka chunk. her back is to the gaping hole as she slowly starts to pass in front of it. ka chunk ka chunk ka chunk. the water swirls around her waist. ka chunk ka chunk ka chunk. she's almost past the gaping hole now. ka chunk ka chunk ka chunk... then something grabs her! she screams! and falls back towards the gaping hole but it's only a twisted piece of metal off a strut. she exhales. relieved. ka chunk ka chunk ka chunk. suddenly, leila's whole body spasms. she screeches wildly, in great pain. the she's ripped backward out through the gaping hole. gone. water sloshes back in. ka chunk ka chunk ka chunk.}
