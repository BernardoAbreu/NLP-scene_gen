<L>__{exterior the ranch another day}
<A>__{a cloud of dust. a dozen or so horses are running in an arena by the stables. tom is riding among them, holding a long stick with an orange flag at the end of it, waving it at the young horses, making them run away from him. the colts stay close together. one of the horses, pilgrim, stays at a distance, off to himself. grace watches from along the railing. she alternates her attention from the horses... to tom.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what we're doing here, grace, is trying to get him to learn how to be a horse again.}
<A>__{he cracks the flag, the horses move together...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{the others already know, see. that's how they are in the wild herd animals...}
<P>__{(cracks the flag)}
<D>__{...when they've got a problem, like they have now with me and this flag, they look to each other. but old pilgrim there has forgotten. i'm the rock and they're the hard place. he thinks he hasn't got a friend in the whole wild world...}
<A>__{c.u. on grace, who clearly feels the same way... but wants desperately not to. she watches him ride off towards pilgrim who has stopped like all the others at the far end of the ring. he stands by himself, tossing his head, snorting, not wanting to be around other horses. tom cracks the flag, keeping them moving. pilgrim does his own private dance. tom rides by grace and hands her the stick;}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{hold this for a minute...}
<A>__{grace stiffens. she doesn't want to, but she's afraid to say "no" to tom. he just insists by tossing it to her...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{hold onto it, go on...}
<A>__{she's forced to catch it. he turns and rides away, chasing down pilgrim, trying to edge him toward the herd. for a moment, he has him breaking to the left with the horses. but as soon as he's clear of tom, he separates himself and comes to stop on his own. tom rides back to grace, taking back the flag.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{we'll get there, grace.}
<A>__{as he says this, he flashes a small, reassuring smile and a little wink. grace melts just a little. as he rides away. annie appears, having come from the creek house. she calls:}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{grace? the clinic just called... they had to change your physical therapy appointment. we have to leave now.}
<A>__{grace frowns a little her mother's "perfect timing." annie approaches the arena, watching tom riding. as he passes her;}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{hello, annie...}
<A>__{annie notices how he says her name.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{mr. booker...}
<A>__{he flashes a smile in her direction and annie's expression comically matches her daughter's reaction. she quickly covers it, however. her eyes follow him as he glides around the arena. it's like watching a great ballet his control of the horses, his effortlessness, his grace, his strength... she smiles to herself in appreciation. then catches herself:}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(to grace)}
<D>__{you got everything you need?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{if i had everything i need, i wouldn't be going to physical therapy.}
<A>__{tom approaches as he overhears grace respond;}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(trying to cheer her)}
<D>__{honey, come on. would you like to stay in town for dinner? maybe see what movie's playing tonight?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{why? there's no food in the house?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{no. i just thought... forget it.}
<A>__{he's getting a clearer view of their relationship.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you know, we're branding here tomorrow. if you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{branding?}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{i haven't branded in years.}
<A>__{tom chuckles.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i will come.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{uh, i don't, honey. branding? oooh... i think we'd just be in mr. booker's way.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{as long as you don't get in the way of the branding iron, it doesn't matter too much.}
<A>__{annie smiles. she turns to grace, questioningly. grace says matter of factly, to prove her pointerior}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i watched margo neuberger get a tattoo.}
<A>__{tom squints. annie shrugs and nods.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{as grace and annie walk to the car, tom says:}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{hey, grace maybe we can get your mom to put me and you branding on the cover of her magazine. start a whole new fashion craze.}
<A>__{they continue walking as grace smiles, enjoying being singled out for his joke. annie responds, almost flirtatiously.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{try not to fall off your high horse, mr. booker.}
<A>__{tom tips his hat and rides away... annie smiles and nods... grace doesn't like their sudden familiarity. or her mother's coy manner. as they enter the suburban, grace asks point blank;}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{did you call dad today?}
<A>__{annie is caught off guard. tom, riding in the arena, catches himself looking after them... then goes riding after pilgrim.}
