<A>__{catherine straightens, with her bag of groceries, shutting her car's back door. she sees, a short distance away }
<B>__{a man}
<A>__{standing at the open rear door of a brown panel truck. his right forearm is in a cast and sling; he is struggling, unsuccessfully, to hoist an armchair into the truck. parked nearby, other cars, rvs, a boat on a trailer. a thin, breast high fog fills the lot; arc lights make yellow pools. catherine hesitates, then crosses towards the man.}

<D>__{help you with that?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{would you? thanks.}
<A>__{his voice is odd, strained, very soft. a fog lamp, set on end on the ground, distorts his features from below. we can't get a good glimpse of his face, but his body is plump, above average height; he's in his mid 30's. she sets down the bag, then together they easily lift the chair into the truck.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{let's slide it up, you mind?}
