<D>__{later. vernon is standing there staring at the sleeping kids.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{wake up! who has to go to the lavatory? everyone raises their hands.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{14. interior library day}
<D>__{later. we see the clock, it now says 10:22. we see andrew stretching. we see bender tearing pages out of a book. he is tossing them around.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{that's real intelligent.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{you're right...it's wrong to destroy literature... he continues to tear pages out.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{it's such fun to read...and, molet really pumps my nads!}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(pronouncing it correctly)}
<D>__{mol yare.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i love his work. bender tosses the rest of the pages at brian. he picks up the card catalogue drawer and begins to take cards out.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{big deal...nothing to do when you're locked in a vacancy..}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{speak for yourself...}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{do you think i'd speak for you? i don't even know your language! andrew turns to claire.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{hey, you grounded tonight? claire shrugs.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i don't know, my mom said i was but by dad told me to just blow her off.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{big party at stubbies, parents are in europe. should be pretty wild...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{yeah, can you go?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i doubt it...}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{how come?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{well 'cause if i do what my mother tells me not to do, it's because because my father says it's okay. there's like this whole big monster deal, it's endless and it's a total drag. it's like any minute... divorce...}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{who do you like better?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{you like your old man better than your mom?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{they're both strict.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{no, i mean, if you had to choose between them.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i dunno, i'd probably go live with my brother. i mean, i don't think either one of them gives a shit about me...it's like they use me just to get back at each other. suddenly, from the back of the room. allison speaks.}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{ha!!! everyone looks at her shocked. allison blows her hair out of her eyes and grins.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{shut up!}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{you're just feeling sorry for yourself...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{yeah, well if i didn't nobody else would.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{aw...you're breaking my heart...}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{sporto...}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{what? bender jumps down and goes next to andrew.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{you get along with your parents?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{well if i say yes, i'm an idiot, right?}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{you're an idiot anyway...but if you say you get along with your parents well you're a liar too! bender turns and walks away from him. andrew follows and pushes bender.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{you know something, man...if we weren't in school right now, i'd waste you! bender points his middle finger at the floor.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{can you hear this? want me to turn it up? bender flips his hand around so he is now giving andrew the bird. brian comes over and puts a hand on each of the guy's shoulders.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{hey fellas, i mean... andrew pushes away from brian.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{...i don't like my parents either, i don't...i don't get along with them...their idea of parental compassion is just, you know, wacko! bender turns to brian.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{dork...}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{you are a parent's wet dream, okay? bender starts to walk away.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{well that's a problem!}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{look, i can see you getting all bunged up for them making you wear these kinda clothes. but face it, you're a neo maxi zoom dweebie! what would you be doing if you weren't out making yourself a better citizen?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{why do you have to insult everybody?}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{i'm being honest, asshole! i would expect you...to know the difference!}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{yeah well, he's gotta name!}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{yeah,}
<P>__{(to brian)}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{brian...}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{see...}
<C>__{bender}
<P>__{(to brian)}
<D>__{my condolences... bender walks away.}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(to bender)}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{what's yours?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{claire...}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{ka laire?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{claire...it's a family name!}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{nooo...it's a fat girl's name!}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{well thank you...}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{you're welcome...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i'm not fat!}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{well not at present but i could see you really pushing maximum density! you see, i'm not sure if you know this...but there are two kinds of fat people. there's fat people that were born to be fat, and then there's fat people that were once thin but they became fat...so when you look at them you can sorta see that thin person inside! you see, you're gonna get married, you're gonna squeeze out a few puppies and then, uh... he mimes becoming fat, making noises. claire gives him the finger.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{oh...obscene finger gestures from such a pristine girl!}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(resentfully)}
<D>__{i'm not that pristine! bender bends down closer to claire.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{are you a virgin?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i will bet you a million dollars that you are! let's end the suspense! is it gonna be...}
<P>__{(another beat)}
<D>__{...a white weddin?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{why don't you just shut up?}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{have you ever kissed a boy on the mouth?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{have you ever been felt up? over the bra, under the blouse, shoes off...hoping to god your parents don't walk in? claire is getting upset.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{do you want me to puke?}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{over the panties, no bra, blouse unbuttoned, calvin's in a ball on the front seat past eleven on a school night?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{leave her alone! bender slowly stands and faces andrew.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{i said leave her alone!}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{you gonna make me?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{yeah... bender walks over to where andrew is standing.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{you and how many of your friends?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{just me, just you and me. two hits. me hitting you, you hitting the floor! anytime you're ready, pal! bender goes to hit him but andrew gets bender down on the ground with a wrestling move.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{i don't wanna get into to this with you man... andrew gets up.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{why not? bender gets up.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{'cause i'd kill you...it's real simple. i'd kill you and your fucking parents would sue me and it would be a big mess and i don't care enough about you to bother.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{chicken shit... andrew turns and walks away. bender takes out a switchblade and opens it. he stabs the switchblade into a chair.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{let's end this right now. you don't talk to her...you don't look at her and you don't even think about her! you understand me?}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{i'm trying to help her!. we see the janitor, carl come into the room.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{brian, how you doing?}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{your dad works here? brian is embarrassed.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{uh, carl?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{can i ask you a question?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{sure...}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{how does one become a janitor?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you wanna be a janitor?}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{no i just wanna know how one becomes a janitor because andrew here, is very interested in persuing a career in the custodial arts...}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{oh, really? you guys think i'm just some untouchable peasant? peon? huh? maybe so, but following a broom around after shitheads like you for the past eight years i've learned a couple of things...i look through your letters, i look through your lockers...i listen to your conversations, you don't know that but i do...i am the eyes and ears of this institution my friends. by the way, that clock's twenty minutes fast! everyone groans. bender smiles.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{shit!}
