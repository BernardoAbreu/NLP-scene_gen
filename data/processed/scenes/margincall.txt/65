<L>__{interior sarah robertson's office day}
<A>__{sarah is sitting at her desk staring out the window. she calmly gets up and walks over to the door and slowly closes it. then she reaches out and twists the blinds on the glass wall separating her office from the floor giving herself total privacy. she walks over to her desk and sits down. she reaches over and grabs a box of tissues, methodically preparing to cry, almost like a surgeon preparing to work. she sits at her desk still seemingly calm and collected. her face starts to tweak just a little, but it just will not give way. again she tries. and again. she can not cry. she can't believe it. the deeply tragic look of total failure floods her eyes but still hardly a twitch on her face. still no tears. finally she makes a forced noise like a sob, but it isn't real and she knows it. then she tries to laugh to herself, she tries again to laugh, but it too is not real. she does feel something, but she simply and very sadly can only openly express even to herself... nothing. i e. will's convertible eric's townhouse day will and seth pull up in front of a very nice large townhouse. they both look up at the house dreading going in.}
