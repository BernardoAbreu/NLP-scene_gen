<L>__{interior apartment day}
<A>__{the elevator doors open, peter and cop #2 exit.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(key in hand)}
<D>__{this is it. please come in... can i get you a cup of coffee or something? cop #2 no thanks. i will just wait out here.}
<A>__{peter enters the apartment and calmly crosses through the house, carrying the basket. as soon as he's out of the cop's sight, he starts running like a madman down the corridor. he runs into michael who was just coming to meet him.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{hey, what's happening? what were those cops doing...}
<A>__{peter shuts him up, grabs him roughly under the arm and leads him into his room, closing the door behind them. peter speaks softly but he's totally freaking out, he can hardly breathe.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{michael... michael... we're in deep trouble. the package... the package...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yeah? what?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{there's a cop on the doorstep... he didn't see you... he mustn't see you... we're in deep trouble, michael...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{tell me what...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{the package they came for wasn't the baby, it was dope, drugs, a shitload of dope! we were stopped by some cops down on the street.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{but did the cops see the dope?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{no, it's right here.}
<A>__{he takes out the package.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{shit!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{we'll get twenty years if the cops find this on us! climb down the fire escape and hide it... anywhere!}
<A>__{michael takes the package, opens the window and starts to climb out it when peter stops him.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{hey, whatever you do, don't lose the goddamn dope, we gotta be able to return it to those dealers or we're dead. those guys are serious.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{don't worry.}
<A>__{he starts down the fire escape, then stops and turns back.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{oh, by the way, i put some water up to boil for her bottle.}
<A>__{michael disappears. peter picks up mary, grabs his wal let and leaves the room. when he gets to the hall, he discovers that cop #1 has joined cop #2, to whom he is whispering something. peter holds his license out for them to see.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{here's my license. cop #1 i'm afraid i'm going to have to ask you to remain in the apartment. the narcotics squad will be arriving any moment now. they want to ask you a few questions.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{narcotics squad? what do they want with me? i don't even use aspirin!}
