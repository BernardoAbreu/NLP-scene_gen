<A>__{it's a few minutes later. "techno syndrome" (mortal kombat!) begins to play. there's a beat, and then steve, in a tuxedo, rushes out onto stage. the applause is deafening, girls screaming, etc. he raises his hands for silence, and then "presents" andrew, also in a tuxedo. mixed reaction from the crowd. andrew's carrying a deck of cards; he fumbles them, they spill onto the floor. audience laughter; steve throws up his arms in exasperation. andrew shrugs, and all the cards leap back up into his hands. there's a beat, and then the audience goes apeshit.}
