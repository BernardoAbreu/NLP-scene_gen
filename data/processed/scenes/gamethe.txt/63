<L>__{50. i n t . b a e r g r a c e o f f i c e s d a y}
<A>__{pan from a window. outside, we see a sign baer grace lumber and the helicopter, now idle on a pad. move past a humming fax machine, find schuyler addressing alan baer across a table. a couple of other lumber execs are present. everyone wears a stricken expression, schuyler's tone is matter of fact.}
<C>__{baer}
<D>__{you've been planning this for months, haven't you? sandbagging me like this, selling us for scrap...}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{bg lumber is not profitable and hasn't been for years, my duty is to salvage what i can. these are the closing papers, in ten minutes i'm going to present the sale terms to the shareholders and elect my new management team.}
<A>__{as he speaks, schuyler moves to the fax machine. a transmission has come through, he picks up the sheaf of papers.}
<C>__{baer}
<D>__{i was friends with your father, you bastard, i watched you grow up, and now you kick me in the balls }
<A>__{schuyler squints at the papers in his hand, flipping through them. close, the entire transmission has been garbled. the words all bleed together incomprehensibly, it looks like a child's scribbles.}
<C>__{baer }
<D>__{that's not how you play the game.}
<A>__{schuyler turns on him, a suspicion forming...}
<C>__{baer}
<D>__{you could've fucking told me!}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{what game?}
<A>__{schuyler studies the senseless pages for a moment then puts them down, shaking off his apprehensions.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{never mind... we'll just have to go with the earlier draft.}
<A>__{in bg, one exec picks up a page, whispers to an assistant, who moves out of the room. schuyler moves to his briefcase. it's locked. he starts patting his pockets.}
<C>__{baer}
<D>__{can't find your keys?}
<A>__{baer has a malevolent expression. schuyler looks at him.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{where are they.}
<C>__{baer}
<D>__{up your ass?}
<A>__{a couple of execs stifle chuckles. schuyler's suspicions mount.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{up my ass, very funny...}
<A>__{his eyes drift to a piece of corporate stationary on the table in front of him. he picks it up: insert under baer grace letterhead we see a handscrawled note: "crs called." we don't see what's written below. schuyler is reeling, paranoia confirmed.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i don't ok. ok, you're with crs...}
<A>__{baer stares at him blankly. schuyler puts a hand over his eyes, seems disoriented, trying to piece it all together.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{so the game, it's just a screen, to blow this deal...}
<C>__{baer}
<D>__{i'm not following you.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{like hell you aren't. how did you get my brother involved, that's unforgivable.}
<A>__{the assembled execs are looking at schuyler in utter confusion. as he speaks, the assistant returns with some paperwork. schuyler stares at him menacingly. hesitantly:}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{um... sorry to interrupt. we've been having some trouble with this fax, so they re sent the material. it's all ok now.}
<A>__{the assistant comes over, cheerfully places the crucial documents in front of schuyler. the assistant fishes in his pocket.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{oh and mr. van orton are these yours? the pilot found 'em on the floor of the chopper...}
<A>__{schuyler gingerly takes the keys which the assistant holds out, looks from them to the paperwork. then he glances back at the handwritten note on the table: insert note: it actually reads "cbs called." (schuyler's thumb or a post it note covered the base of the b before, making it look like an r.) it continues "re: interview with alan b. on sun..." schuyler takes a breath, reassembles his composure and consults his watch. he rises, anxious to put the last few minutes behind him.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{everything seems to be in order. please disregard my last comments. the shareholders meeting is about to get underway... shall we?}
<A>__{he heads for the door. as he leaves, the execs exchange looks.}
