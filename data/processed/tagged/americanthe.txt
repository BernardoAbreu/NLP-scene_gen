<L>__{interior dacha night}
<A>__{jack (dark, fit, mid forties) is staring at the embers of a log fire. he sips from a thick cut crystal glass of whiskey. the impressive us army special forces crest tattooed on the shoulder of his bare torso is at odds with jack's quiet manner and the distinguished silver that flecks his hair and stubble. jack is no longer young. a creak behind him and his eyes flick over his left shoulder. ingrid (34) is naked. with an intimate familiarity she kisses jack on the top of his head, sits close behind him and wraps her arms around her lover, linking her slender hands across his upper chest. her head resting on his shoulder, her face beside his, ingrid and jack watch the fire together in easy silence.}
<L>__{exterior woods morning}
<A>__{ingrid leads jack through the trees. her coat has a white fur collar. they are fresh faced and warm from bed. they head towards a vast and frozen lake. jack senses something in the woods. beneath the conifers: impenetrable darkness. jack looks around. thick snow blankets the world and muffles any sound. there is not the slightest breeze.}

<L>__{exterior lakeside morning}
<A>__{they continue through the woods until they reach the shoreline of the lake. ingrid steps onto the ice. holds out her hand. a beat. jack takes ingrid's hand. solid as stone, the frozen lake takes his weight. they walk out, ingrid slipping and laughing. the landscape is magical. jack begins to relax, slipping and swearing. suddenly, he stops. there are footprints in the thin snow going out across the lake.}

<D>__{snow hare.}
<A>__{beside the snow hare's prints are those of a man.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{a hunter?}
<A>__{jack studies the two sets of tracks. those of the snow hare are heading out into the lake. the man's prints are heading in the opposite direction, towards the shoreline. jack spins around in the direction they've just come from. no one. then, about ten metres inland from the edge of the lake, a low branch dips and a thick rug of snow falls from the branch. jack grabs ingrid, yanks her towards the cover of the lakeside trees and pushes her down into the snow. she grunts, winded. he lies besides her. we hear the crack of a bullet so quiet it might be a bough snapping under the weight of winter. it isn't. jack pulls a walther ppk s semi automatic handgun from the pocket of his parka. cocks it. waits. then bobs up and down once. there's another crack from the trees. jack pinpoints the spot from the drift of blue smoke, almost invisible in the winter air. there's someone in the shadows. he rubs snow into his woollen hat, edges up until he can just see over the snow and pumps three shots into the dusk under the trees. we hear a muttering groan and then a sliding sound, as if jack has just shot a tobogganist. more snow slides off the trees. jack waits. ingrid gathers her breath but loses her wits:}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{you have a gun.}
<A>__{jack keeps his eyes fixed on the trees.}
<C>__{ingrid}

<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{jack?}
<A>__{he stands up slowly and walks inland towards the corpse that is just visible now in the shadows beneath the trees. ingrid follows, frightened. the man is slouched forwards in a drift of snow, his body cushioned in white softness. jack kicks the sole of his boot. he's dead.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{jack talk to me!}
<A>__{jack grabs his collar and turns him over. he doesn't recognise him. jack fumbles at his buttons and rummages in his clothing. in his breast pocket he finds a military identity pass.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{who is he?}

<D>__{a hunter.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{he's not dressed like a hunter. why is he alone? hunters always go in pairs. for safety.}
<A>__{swiftly, jack removes the bolt from the man's rifle and throws it far into the trees.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{go for help. call the police.}
<A>__{ingrid sets off, stumbling up the track they have made through the snow. jack shoots her just once, in the nape of her neck. she twitches in the snow, her blood staining the white fur of her coat collar. from a distance, ingrid looks like a shot snow hair. jack approaches her. and steps over her, trying not to look down. trying not to look back.}
<L>__{exterior dacha morning}
<A>__{outside the dacha is another man, standing by a black mercedes benz sedan. the second hunter. he is holding an automatic pistol but he's not on alert. jack fells him easily with a bullet in the ear. he removes the clip from his walther and reloads it.}

<A>__{jack takes the envelope and puts it in an inside pocket. larry is about to speak but stops. the waiter reappears and puts down two cups of coffee. larry puts two cubes of sugar in his cup and starts stirring. then speaks low and fast:}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you can't stay here, jack. you won't see `em coming, not in a big city. but you can't go far, either. if the gentlemen whose accounts you closed belonged to brink, gallazzo, simenov any of the first division you have four or five hours at most before every airport, train station, bus stop, toll booth and ski lift from stockholm to skopje is under surveillance.}

<A>__{we're in another world. jack's car is winding its way up a twisting mountain road towards... ...a ramshackle, lonely, desolate italian hilltop town. the town sits beneath it's own castle. medieval towers, gables, streets and church bells: framed by the snow capped mountain peaks beyond. this is not the italy of e.m. forster or of bella tuscany. this is the italy where the crusaders built their fortresses. the italy where sergio leone conceived of his great westerns. a church bell tolls...}
<L>__{exterior cross roads day}
<A>__{jack stops the car. at the crossroads is a signpost pointing to the town. the sign reads:}
<B>__{castelvecchio.}
<L>__{interior car continuous}
<A>__{jack looks at the sign. he looks up at the silent town, at the vast stone ramparts. an old man comes out of a crooked medieval doorway, stares at jack and disappears into another building. jack looks at the dead sockets of the windows, random beneath the rotting patchwork of rooves. a dog barks. the wind hisses. the atmosphere is deathly. jack makes a decision. and drives away.}
<L>__{exterior italian landscape day}
<A>__{we see jack's car heading away from castelvecchio. the car crosses a spectacular viaduct that spans a deep}

<T>__{fade out: fade in:}
<L>__{exterior castel del monte, main square day}
<A>__{castel del monte is a well preserved, happy looking little mediaeval town with a handful of tourists. a chunk of time has passed. jack is sitting on a table outside a small bar wearing dark glasses, sipping a coffee and reading a guide book. he looks like a tastefully dressed, well educated american tourist. he blends in. and no one pays him much attention as he finishes his coffee, pays his bill, gets up and leaves. we follow jack as he passes the parapet of the town ramparts and looks across the spectacular valley... ...towards the deserted castelvecchio.}
<L>__{exterior castel del monte, old town centre day}
<A>__{at a leisurely pace, jack passes a row of municipal rubbish bins just inside the fortified gates to the old town. hidden well behind the bins we catch sight of jack's parked}
<B>__{car.}
<L>__{exterior castel del monte, town square day}
<A>__{we're right in the heart of the mediaeval old town: like the stronghold at the centre of a castle. jack approaches a small family run bed and breakfast just off the main square. the sign reads: "pensione abruzzo".}
<L>__{interior pensione abruzzo day}
<A>__{the internal courtyard is refreshingly cool. in the centre of the courtyard is a fountain made of marble shot through with black veins. in the fountain stands an alabaster statue of a girl. she's wearing a toga and holding a clam shell from which the water falls. the water is delivered by a two and quarter millimetre diameter pipe made of bronze. as jack crosses the courtyard he glances at the statue. he finds it hard to tear his eyes away.}

<A>__{a toothbrush in the glass by the sink. the guidebook on the bedside table. apart for this, jack has avoided unpacking: living entirely out of his holdall for some time. from the holdall, jack produces a pair of leica 15x56 geovid brf rangefinding binoculars. through his casement window he has good view of}
<B>__{castelvecchio.}
<A>__{he sweeps the town in grid formation: calm and methodical. this is a routine assessment. jack's pov: apart from the occasional appearance of an old man, woman or dog, the dead town across the valley is empty.}

<A>__{jack is lying on top of his bed, fully clothed and wide awake. taped to the inside of the wooden bed frame... ...is his walther semi automatic handgun.}

<A>__{blinding sun fills frame. jack is ostensibly photographing the sights: the mediaeval architecture, the square, the church.}
<L>__{exterior castel del monte, church day}
<A>__{the church is at the top of town. a priest, dressed in black, surveys the world below him: locals are going about their business, a few scattered tourists are enjoying their holiday. one `tourist' catches the priest's attention. perhaps it's his build. or the fact that he's the only tourist on his own. or perhaps it's the obsessive grid like methodology with which jack photographs the little town...}
<L>__{exterior castel del monte, alleyway day}
<A>__{jack turns casually down one of the town's many narrow alleyways. the alleyway way bends left and right in a series of blind corners and dark tunnels, the street enclosed by arches, criss crossed by flying stone buttresses and flanked by outside stairwells. it's a stalker's heaven or hell depending on how dangerous the prey. jack proceeds along the alleyway until he gets to a crossroads where four narrow alleyways converge. each alleyway leads uphill or downhill with varying degrees of steepness. jack photographs each alleyway. from an upstairs window he can hear the soundtrack of a game show on television. from another alleyway comes the sound of a barking dog. no dog is visible. curious, jack turns around, walking back the way he came. the sound of barking gets louder. on his right hand side, jack finds a hidden archway. the hidden archway resembles an archer's slit but is big enough for a gown man to slip through. unlike a window, the `slit' is actually just a crack in a triangular convergence of two separate and slightly overlapping ancient stone walls. the confluence of two stone surfaces makes the narrow gap between them very, very difficult to spot. jack slips though the hidden archway. inside is a courtyard.}
<L>__{interior courtyard day}
<A>__{rotting doors lead to abandoned cellars and storerooms. a mongrel tied to a post is barking savagely, his leash keeping him inches from sinking his bared fangs into jack. jack stares at the dog: a mysterious creature of fear and fury.}
<L>__{exterior narrow alleyway day}
<A>__{jack reappears through the hidden archway and slips back into the narrow alleyway. it's like he's materialised from thin air. he takes 2 photographs: first of the hidden archway and then of the street sign: via romana. just then a man on an original 1970s ducati turns down the alleyway and drives towards him. casually, jack continues walking. the ducati gets nearer. the man on the ducati is wearing a black crash helmet with a tinted visor. jack picks up his pace. the ducati is ten metres away. jack's right hand moves towards his pocket. five metres. jack's hand goes in his pocket. two metres. bang! jack drops to his knees. bang! the ducati backfires for a second time. a pause. still on his knees, jack pretends to tie his right shoe lace. the man on the ducati stops outside an apartment further up the alleyway, gets off his rickety motorbike and removes his helmet. he's a corpulent, ruddy faced italian man in his late sixties. he glances at jack. jack stands.}

<A>__{a woman's voice comes from within the house loud and angry distracting the man on the ducati, who screams back passionately, enters his front door, and shuts it behind him with a hearty slam. jack walks on.}

<C>__{clara}

<C>__{clara}
<D>__{stand by me.}
<A>__{he obeys her order. he walks out to her and she takes his hand under the water, holding it out in front of them. jack spots it resting on the smooth stone of the lake bed. brassy and gleaming. a spent shell. he covers it with his foot.}

<D>__{keep still. watch.}

<D>__{it is said that if these fishes bite at two hands holding, then love is good for the people.}

<D>__{maybe we should...}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{do you make love in the water?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i haven't.}

<D>__{what's wrong?}
<A>__{he doesn't know what to say. she looks at him: confused, searching.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{let's eat.}

<A>__{about this he's telling the truth. clara reaches for the red purse. from behind the picnic hamper lid we hear the click of a cocking mechanism. clara hesitates for a moment. jack watches her intently. she reaches into her purse. jack is expressionless. when clara withdraws her right hand she is holding a tube of}
<B>__{suntan lotion.}
<A>__{a beat. jack watches as she commences smoothing it into her skin, rubbing it around her breasts, pushing them aside, pressing them upwards. then she caresses the lotion into her belly and down her thighs, bending at the waist as she works it into her shins.}

<D>__{will you put this on my back?}
<A>__{she proffers him the suntan lotion. jack stares at her baking body, transfixed by its terrible and perfect beauty. hidden behind the lid of the picnic hamper... ...his trembling right hand grips tightly to his walther. a long pause.}

<D>__{sure. you?}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{everything's just fine.}

<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{buy yourself a retirement clock.}
<A>__{her american accent shows that she's letting her guard down. maybe it's designed to make jack do the same. it doesn't.}

<D>__{how do you know i'm retiring?}
<A>__{she leans forward and kisses him lightly and quickly and on the lips.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{have you taken your girl up to the meadow yet?}
<A>__{jack doesn't answer. his whole body is tense for the bullet that he knows his coming. perhaps there is a second person in the car. just then... ...a coach pulls into the car park. it stops with a hydraulic hiss and dozens of teenage kids descend. mathilde looks both irritated and relieved.}

<A>__{jack tenses as mathilde raises her hand in farewell. the ford pulls away and disappears down the slip road onto the autostrada. jack watches it go. thumbs back the lever on his walther. gets into his citroen. and opens the envelope. no wires. no tricks. just a hundred thousand us dollars. jack stares at the money. he isn't supposed to be alive. for a while he stays put. he shuts his eyes in the sunshine and listens to the laughter of the teenage kids. to a girl calling: "amore!" to the cicadas. to the distant rush of traffic on the autostrada.}
