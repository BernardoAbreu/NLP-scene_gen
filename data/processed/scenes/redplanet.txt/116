<L>__{exterior martian horizon}
<A>__{the sun begins to set. 30 miles away, the terminus, the line where night turns to day, begins to advance across the planet towards them. in the dark of the shadow, the frost forms a dozen feet behind and follows growing, growling the cold advancing towards us with a crackling crunching freezing whine. it's as if the cold has a sound...}
<B>__{back at hillock}
<A>__{gallagher and burchenal can see the darkness approaching. digging madly. cackling. losing their minds. can't tell who is who as they're silhouetted against the sun, one now inside the hillock throwing rock back as the other clears. the sun continues to drop. terminus continues its pernicious hissing and freezing approach. halfway inside now. on his knees, suit light on, gallagher chops away at the rock. when he's thigh deep in debris, he backs out, dragging the leavings with him. burchenal leaps in, replacing him. dripping in sweat, nutty, but at least they're doing something. the last of the sun disappears. their breath is in the air. the darkness and frost reaches them now. the sweat begins to freeze, ice in their hair and eyebrows and stubble. but they've dug most of the shelter. they continue to thrash and chop away. the frost is now everywhere. gallagher climbs inside. burchenal drags a lava boulder over to seal the entrance. climbs in, hooks his tool into the rock and seals it shut.}
