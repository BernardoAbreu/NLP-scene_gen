<A>__{vinnie rounds the corner and sees nothing. he walks a little further and notices a trail of smelts lined up on the ground. he follows the trail around a corner and we see roc, unconscious but moaning. he is sitting against the ground, with his legs spread apart and the pail over his head. the trail of smelts leads to his crotch. there is one halfway into his zipper, with its tail flipping. vinnie takes in this sight, then rushes over to roc and stands him up.}

<C>__{ace}
<D>__{guess what, boys, it's nap time.}
<A>__{ace gently releases the hook. just as vinnie and roc turn to look, the iron hook shears both of their heads clean off. two headless bodies fall to the ground in slow motion with blood gushing from their necks. close on ace horrified}
