<L>__{exterior martian plain day}
<A>__{a landscape so huge, it's hard to comprehend. five tiny figures progress across the bottom of the frame. they've already come a long ways. beginning to string out. pause and regather. pettengill stops to catch his breath.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{how you doing?}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{little tired. i'm okay.}
<C>__{santen}
<D>__{you should have put more treadmill time in.}
<C>__{pettengill}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{go fuck yourself.}
<C>__{santen}
<D>__{what'd you say?}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{ahhh...musclehead, go fuck yourself??}
<A>__{they're both getting louder and louder...}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{guys...}
<A>__{burchenal reaches out, checks their wrist monitors.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{we're doing fine. in point of fact, he's using less o2 than you are. we can stop a minute. unless you two want to shout at each other and use up your air.}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{santen}
<D>__{fine. i'm sorry, too.}
<A>__{no one's sorry. they rest. use the moment to look around. it's pretty astounding. chantilas uses the respite to re scan his abdomen. puts the device away again. he's in pain but refuses to acknowledge it.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{how you doing?}
<C>__{chantilas}
<D>__{things are as they are.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{lord. look at it, we're on mars. pretty damn amazing.}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{it' weird. there's nothing here.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{it's mars.}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{no, i mean there's not even a trace of the algae.}
<A>__{he kneels down, examines a rock. nada.}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{even if it all died, there'd be something a dried algal mat, traces on the lee sides, something. nothing. nada.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{he's right. we sent up fifty two varietals. blue green, black, orange. anhydriobiosics, chemotrauphs, even a thibacillus that could grow autotrophically on elemental sulfur. not only are they dead, they're all just gone. i don't get it. it's like they were scoured off the rock.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{maybe there was never anything in this valley.}
<A>__{as they walk, burchenal checks his hcc.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{if we are where we think we are }
<A>__{map appears on a small screen, he mutters to it, overlays of all the algae and lichen that were on mars appear.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{this valley was covered with blue algae a month ago. valley back one should have been covered in an orange red chloroflectic. he's right. it's weird. there should be something.}
<A>__{they crest a small rise. below lies a valley that closes down quickly into an extremely narrow canyon. burchenal and santen check their hhc maps.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{this, however, makes sense.}
<C>__{santen}
<D>__{debris apron. delineated valley fill. depositional fan...}
<A>__{he double checks with chantilas. seems they're going the right way. chantilas leans back heavily against a rock.}
<C>__{chantilas}
<D>__{good. you gotta keep moving...}
<A>__{chantilas doesn't get up.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{and what're you gonna do, sit here and watch? you getting old and lazy?}
<C>__{chantilas}
<D>__{my spleen's ruptured. there's significant internal bleeding. i'm not going any further. and trying to carry me will slow you down just enough that we can all die.}
<A>__{robby's stunned, frantic.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{we'll get you to the hab. lock out the spine impulse and you can walk one of us through it.}
<C>__{chantilas}
<D>__{no. you won't.}
<A>__{santen takes charge. it's his mission now.}
<C>__{santen}
<D>__{we build a litter. we take him.}
<C>__{chantilas}
<P>__{(stern)}
<D>__{chain of command once we hit the surface starts with me. and i'm ordering you to go, lieutenant. now.}
<P>__{(turns to robby)}
<D>__{i've only got about forty minutes. there's really not much pain. put me around the corner where i've got a view.}
<A>__{they lift him to the other side of the rock. gallagher stays with chantilas a moment. stricken, speechless. inside gallagher's helmet, we can see as the tears roll down. then }
<C>__{chantilas}
<D>__{it's okay. i'm not sorry i came.}
<A>__{gallagher takes one last look over his shoulder. we are already pulling back, back, back. tiny figures in the landscape once again. one left behind.}
