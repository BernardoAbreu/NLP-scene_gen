<L>__{interior police station showers moments later}
<A>__{a deputy enters the showers and sees a naked woman on top of a deputy, their arms locked in a struggle. the deputy cracks the naked woman in the back of the head with her baton and she falls to the side, revealing meagan now dressed in the deputy's uniform laying on the shower floor. the deputy realizes her mistake too late meagan sprays her in the face with mace and she sinks to her knees, screaming and clutching her face. meagan leaps to her feet, grabs a towel to hold over her face (as if she had a broken nose) and starts to exit. on her way out, meagan is passed by several deputies charging into the showers to restore order. she gestures them on, then slips into an emergency exit to freedom.}
