<LOC>__{EXT   NIGHT   URBAN TERRACE}
<ACTION>__{A row of rundown terrace houses. Some are boarded up. Not all the street lights work. Those that do cast shadows of parked vehicles glistening in the rain. A front door opens and DON appears with rubbish which he puts in a bin. He hears something and looks up to see four big horses pulling a hulking great wagon down the middle of the street. The wagon is a gigantic windowless box. The horses are harnessed and there are reins but no sign of a driver. It's a very weird sight. DON, unable to take his eyes off this amazing apparition shouts back into the house from where light from a TV flickers.}

<ACTION>__{The wagon has stopped. The back begins to open, top, bottom and sides, like a dark menacing flower unfolding its petals. Shadowy FIGURES manoeuvre the side panels and begin to raise the roof. While this is happening THE CAMERA tracks around to reveal a garishly lit club across the street. A group of DRUNKEN YOUTHS emerge from the club, staggering, laughing, shouting, drinking, breaking bottles, and throwing up. The LADS grope the GIRLS. Everyone's having "a great time". They see the wagon and stop, unsteadily, in their tracks.}
<CHAR>__{MARTIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What the...!}
<ACTION>__{We now see what they see. The wagon has been converted into a stage. We're looking at an old fashioned and very shabby travelling theatre. Electric footlights are powered by a clanking generator. The pediment above the stage carries the words: THE ASTONISHING IMAGINARIUM OF DOCTOR PARNASSUS. PERCY, a dwarf, dressed as a medieval demon and rigged out as a one-man band plays a fanfare introducing a young man (ANTON, 18-19 years old) who emerges from the back of the stage dressed as MERCURY, the messenger of the gods, with wings on his helmet and sandals.}
<DIAL>__{ANTON/MERCURY Ladies and Gentlemen... Step up! Step up!... I, Mercury, the messenger of the gods, invite you... tonight, for one night only... at this very venue... to enter the mind, the very great mind, of Doctor Parnassus!}
<ACTION>__{PERCY does a roll on the drum as a curtain behind ANTON/MERCURY rises to reveal DOCTOR PARNASSUS - he appears to be an Indian holy man - long scraggly beard, chalk white make up, a large red circle on his bald head, a crown of yellow flowers, strings of beads, and partially covered in a loose-fitting swath of white cloth - apparently levitating several feet above the stage. (He's sitting on a glass plinth). DOCTOR PARNASSUS is seemingly in a trance. A bronze tripod containing burning incense stands beside him.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{ANTON/MERCURY (CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Doctor Parnassus... as old as time... yes, ladies and gentlemen, more than a thousand years old ... he has the power to empower your mind. A secret learned in the mystic East. Let Doctor Parnassus open your imagination. Let him guide and transport you to worlds and possibilities you never dreamt of... If you dare. But... Beware... there are dangers. You will have to choose. Will your soul fly?... Or will it be dashed on the rocks of darkness? The choice is yours and yours alone. Transcend the heights on Beauty's wing.}
<ACTION>__{A young woman, VALENTINA,(wearing a wig of long blonde hair and a white, flowing costume which gives her prominent hips and breasts) stands facing an elaborately framed full-length mirror nestled upstage amongst cut-out trees representing a forest... This is `Beauty'. She turns and steps forward. ANTON takes her hand. They make a couple of dance steps together. They look enchanting and enchanted.}

<ACTION>__{ANTON tries to prevent MARTIN from getting on stage. But MARTIN thumps ANTON and pulls him into the `audience'. MARTIN'S drunken MATES laugh and applaud. MARTIN is now on stage and heading for DOCTOR PARNASSUS who is still in a trance. PERCY tries to head him off but MARTIN shoves PERCY off the stage. PERCY lands on the ground with a crash. More laughter from the MOB.}

<ACTION>__{MARTIN lunges at `Beauty' who retreats up stage. MARTIN blunders into the scenery as he pursues `Beauty' who stays just out of reach. She takes cover behind a cut-out tree. ANTON and PERCY climb back onto the stage as MARTIN continues to chase `Beauty'. VALENTINA evades him by ducking through the mirror (made of flexible reflective material slit down the middle). MARTIN crashes after her. ANTON and PERCY exchange worried looks. They look at DOCTOR PARNASSUS. Should they wake him from his trance? They decide not to but it's a difficult decision.}
<LOC>__{INT/EXT   MAGICAL FOREST}
<ACTION>__{The stage set, which was clearly only a few feet deep, now seems much deeper and to contain many more cut-out trees. `Beauty' weaves in and out of the 2 dimensional trees as MARTIN chases her further into the increasingly magical forest. Beauty's costume has been transformed into something wonderful. (A rainbow studded with diamonds?) VALENTINA comes into view. MARTIN is in hot pursuit.}
<CHAR>__{MARTIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Come here you little sexpot!}
<ACTION>__{VALENTINA stops, turns, smiles sweetly and slams her fist hard into MARTIN'S gut. He doubles up. VALENTINA pauses for a moment, contemplating doing some serious damage, before striding off. MARTIN staggers to his feet.}

<DIAL>__{Come back! You bitch!}
<ACTION>__{He rushes after her but, trips on a root (a real 3 dimensional tree root) and pitches face first to the ground. Recovering, he looks up. Shock. He is surrounded by a dark, terrible, and very REAL forest. `Beauty' has vanished.}
<LOC>__{EXT   THE STAGE     NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{VALENTINA, `Beauty', slips back on stage through the mirror. Her costume has reverted to its original state. She examines her knuckles on the hand with which she punched Martin. ANTON looks at her. She shrugs. DR. PARNASSUS is still in a trance, his lips moving soundlessly. ANTON watches DOCTOR PARNASSUS in awe. `Beauty' sighs. She's had enough.}

<CHAR>__{MARTIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mum...Mum!...}
<ACTION>__{His voice echoes through the giant trees. But his cries are interrupted by another sound...a Tarzan-like howl. MARTIN spins around. Strange creatures are swinging on vines through the giant trees. They are all around him. They look like HANDS... with little heads and arms where the wrists should be. They are all howling and jabbering. From behind, a HAND CREATURE swings down and grabs MARTIN by the collar, hoisting him high into the air. Clearing the trees, MARTIN sees he is not alone. There are many other people - all in the clutches of HAND CREATURES swinging on "vines". But, the "vines" are actually long, slim tentacles... dangling from enormous, luridly coloured JELLYFISH that float through the dark, frightening, sky. From some of the tentacles, bottles of booze dangle - just out of reach of the struggling crowd - all desperate for a drink.}
<CHAR>__{MARTIN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Please... I'll never...! Never again!. Honest!... From now on... I swear!.. Not a drop!}
<ACTION>__{With a smile of satisfaction, the HAND CREATURE stops jabbering and let's go of MARTIN'S collar. Down he plummets. The ground rushes up. MATRTIN is as good as dead. But when he hits the ground, rather than going SPLAT!!, he bounces high in the air, turns a couple somersaults and lands on his feet. He can't believe what has just happened... and then he hears music. Beautiful, ethereal music. In the distance a light is glowing. It's the sun, rising above a majestic mountain pass. Cut into the rock, is a long stairway winding up to the summit. The HAND CREATURE swings down, gives MARTIN the "thumbs up", and points encouragingly toward the stairway. Reformed and determined, MARTIN heads for the      stairs. But on reaching them he discovers that each one is 6      feet high. The stairway is ridiculously steep and difficult.      Letters are carved into the first stair..."THE 12X12 STEP      PROGRAM...GOOD LUCK". This is going to be tough. The sound of a honky-tonk piano makes him turn. Behind him the sky is dark. A roadside bar/nightclub with flashing neon lights has appeared. He hesitates. He could use a drink before the long climb. He heads for the club. The door to the club is opened by a mechanical fairground figure of a jolly smiling man (MR NICK) distinguished by a bowler hat and a red waistcoat.}
<CHAR>__{MR NICK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hi there. C'mon in. Looks like you could use a drink.}
<ACTION>__{MARTIN, relieved and reassured by the welcome, steps inside. The door closes followed by the sound from within of much gaiety and laughter. THE CAMERA pulls back as the nightclub suddenly EXPLODES IN A}

A sign proclaims "Please Take Generously" Directly behind the glass box is a half-globe with the continent of Africa featured. Sitting on top is Percy playing something ethnic but tasteful on a flute with one hand...his other is held out pathetically... a beggar. He's blacked up and dressed in rags. He doesn't look happy. He sneaks nervous glances at the glass box of money. The wagon, newly painted in sleek and stylish black and white, stands in Bond Street or some similarly fashionable street with expensive shops and art galleries. RICH WOMEN anxious to be conspicuous in their consumption of wealth glide past. New signs proclaim `The Choice Is Yours' `The Imaginarium - More Exclusive than ever'. The stage, hung with soft,flowing, gauzy fabric, has been chromatically divided in half - one side black, the other white. On the dark side a bloated, sun-glassed woman consuming vast quantities of food reclines on an elaborate lounge. She is, in fact, a very uncomfortable ANTON in full and fulsome drag. Center stage stands DR. PARNASSUS dressed as a stylized doctor with head reflector. In his hand is a staff with an elaborate sun on the top. He is blindfolded. On the white side of the stage stands the mirror and a stylized Tree of Knowledge with bright red apples. Under the tree, and reflected in the mirror, sits VALENTINA as Eve...naked except for a long wig that maintains her modesty. She gracefully combs her hair. Above the mirror is a sign proclaiming "The Naked Truth". DR. PARNASSUS, peeking under his blindfold, is distinctly uncomfortable by his daughter's lack of attire. TONY, in a beautifully cut white suit, and wearing his `romantic' Venetian carnival mask sits in profile in a dreamy pose on the edge of the white side of the stage. Nobody speaks. They pay no attention to the crowd. A few women stop, curious. One of them takes out some money and puts it in the glass plinth and turns to go.}

But as they rush in that direction another wall rises up blocking them. Again it is painted with a hill and TONY frozen in midstride. A third and fourth wall rise up.. surrounding and trapping the RUSSIANS. There is a cell door in one wall. Like crazy animals they start throwing themselves against the door trying to break it down. It won't budge. While the others batter the door, GREGOR, who has been somewhat affected by the soft shampoo commercial world, sits quietly in a corner picking pretty flowers. Exhausted, the other RUSSIANS collapse on the ground. GREGOR gently breathes in the aroma of the flowers and exhales. As he does the door swings open. The other RUSSIANS gape at him... then barrel out the door. Outside is a new, beautiful, landscape - the sky dotted with white fluffy clouds. Extending from the ground to each cloud is an incredibly long ladder. On each ladder is a person climbing upwards. The RUSSIANS spot Tony. He is already a hundred feet up a ladder and climbing. Unfortunately, their way is blocked by an over-bright, hyper- active, wide-eyed sales girl.}

He gets it to his mouth as if to swallow it when... ... the ground erupts and a giant London policeman's helmet rises up (we are talking 20 feet tall)and revolves - revealing DR.

From inside the giant mouth a smiling policeman beckons the RUSSIANS to come on in.. The terrified RUSSIANS let go of the lynching rope. TONY drops to the ground and, with a whistle, the brass pipe flies out of his mouth. Behind the RUSSIANS a painted backdrop unfurls..it reads "JOIN THE FUZZ.. WE LOVE VIOLENCE".. and a chorus line of LONG-LEGGED GIRLS in mini-skirted police outfits appear - high-kicking a snappy song and dance number. The astonished RUSSIANS don't know what the fuck is going on. Suddenly, a friendly OLD WOMAN'S VOICE is heard shouting something in Russian. Spinning around, the RUSSIANS see an old BABOUSHKA (Russian grandmother) outside a tumble-down cottage waving gaily to them. A stunned pause. Then, pell-mell, they rush to her.}
