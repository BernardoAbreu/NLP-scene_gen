<L>__{interior greenhouse moment later}
<A>__{through the steamy panes, we see grady approach with the balloon, enter. he crosses to a high table, sets the balloon down, and steps back, considering the placement.}
<P>__{sara o.s.)}
<D>__{feeling guilty?}
<A>__{grady jumps startled and turns. sara has materialized behind a ficus, large potting gloves on her hands.}
<C>__{sara }
<D>__{i can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{totally. i'm sorry. a lot was happening this morning. can you talk?}
<A>__{sara nods, moves the ficus to another table.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{walter's on campus, being the good soldier for wordfest. but he's a basket case. someone stole marilyn's jacket last night. and poe's missing, too.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i heard.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{you heard? how?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{a twelve year old policeman came by the house this morning.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{did you confess?}
<A>__{grady looks up, mildly alarmed.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{really? that was fast.}
<C>__{sara}
<P>__{(frowning)}
<D>__{i'm kidding. hello?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{oh. right. ha. listen, about last night. there is something i need to tell...}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{are you limping? why are you limping?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{hub? oh, well, that's part of what i need to . . .}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{did you pass out again, grady? did you fall somewhere?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{no. i mean. well, actually, yes. sort of. i don't remember. listen, sara, i have to tell you something.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{all right.}
<A>__{sara settles back, folds her arms. waiting.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i...}
<A>__{as grady stares into sara's eyes, things begin to blur.}
<C>__{grady }
<D>__{...want to be with you.}
<A>__{sara looks at him.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{gee, grady, that sounded so heartfelt. i don't know whether to swoon or smirk.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{really, sara, i...}
<A>__{sara holds up one gloved hand.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i believe you. i believe you want to be with me. but this is not just about me anymore.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i know that. i know what's at stake here...}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{no, i don't think you do. and besides... i haven't decided yet.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{about the baby.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{that ...and you.}
<A>__{grady goes still, watches sara strip off the gloves, drop them on a table.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i'm not going to draw the map for you on this one, grady. times like these you have to do your own navigating.}
<A>__{sara turns to leave, then stops, squinting far down the street.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{who's that sitting in your car?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{james leer.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{what's he doing out there?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i'm sort of helping him work through some issues.}
<A>__{sara raises an eyebrow, then pushes through the door.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{isn't he lucky.}
<A>__{grady watches her ripple across the glass, head for the house, and wave. james, slumped low in the galaxie, offers a limp hand in return, but it's too late. she's already gone.}
