<L>__{interior julie's apartment continuous action}
<A>__{but as burnett enters the house, all he notices are that two dogs start yapping hysterically. he can't see her. but she can see him. from behind the door, she comes out swinging a bat. burnett ducks and julie smashes the hat stand instead.}

<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{i knew her from way back. from time to time, you know... we'd get together. mess around, you know?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{wrong.}
<A>__{julie swings for real, nearly taking burnett's head off.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{okay. okay. so i exaggerated. it's a man thing.}
<A>__{she swings again, but he's had enough, he moves quickly, catching the bat with his hand and ripping it away from her.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{you know what? you don't wanna believe me? that's fine with me! go it alone.}
<A>__{burnett heads toward the open door. julie's veneer drops as she shrinks to the floor.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i saw it all... i watched him shoot her. like she was nothing.}
<P>__{(trying to hold it together)}
<D>__{please shut the door.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{you don't got any more golf clubs or bats, do you? nothin' that you can swing at me, do you?}
<A>__{she shakes her head. he carefully steps forward.}

<D>__{then lemme introduce myself. i'm mike lowrey. and i'm here to help you.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{you're not what i expected.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{yeah, well neither are you. you swing like barry bonds.}
<A>__{burnett nods and crosses over to help julie to her feet.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{alright. look here, i need to know if you've called anybody. or if you told anybody else where you are?}
<C>__{julie}

<A>__{burnett's getting a "not again" look on his face when kuh boom! a shotgun blast blows the front door open. clutching the bag, julie races around the living room.}

<C>__{julie}
<D>__{luke?! where's my other dog?!}
