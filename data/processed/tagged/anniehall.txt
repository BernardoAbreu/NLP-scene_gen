"i would never wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member." that's the key joke of my adult life in terms of my relationships with women. tsch, you know, lately the strangest things have been going through my mind, 'cause i turned forty, tsch, and i guess i'm going through a life crisis or something, i don't know. i, uh ... and i'm not worried about aging. i'm not one o' those characters, you know. although i'm balding slightly on top, that's about the worst you can say about me. i, uh, i think i'm gonna get better as i get older, you know? i think i'm gonna be the the balding virile type, you know, as opposed to say the, uh, distinguished gray, for instance, you know? 'less i'm neither o' those two. unless i'm one o' those guys with saliva dribbling out of his mouth who wanders into a cafeteria with a shopping bag screaming about socialism.}

<A>__{the camera pulls back, showing alvy sitting with two men at a table set up near the actors. a mirror, running the whole width of the wall, reflects the two actors, a script lying on the table between them. it is obvious now that they are rehearsing a scene that alvy wrote.}

<D>__{okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, i guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! you know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here ... in a health food restaurant on sunset boulevard. goodbye, sunny.}

<D>__{tsch, whatta you want? it was my first play. you know, you know how you're always tryin' t' get things to come out perfect in art because, uh, it's real difficult in life. interestingly, however, i did run into annie again. it was on the upper west side of manhattan.}
<A>__{annie, singing "seems like old times, " overlaps alvy's speech and continues over the next scene, where alvy, standing in front of a manhattan theater, shakes hands with annie and her escort. the theater marquee reads "ophuls prize film: 'the sorrow and the pity'."}
<C>__{alvy's voice}
<P>__{(over the theater scene and, annie's singing)}
<D>__{she had moved back to new york. she was living in soho with some guy.}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{and when i met her she was, of all things, dragging him in to see "the sorrow and the pity." which i counted as a personal triumph. annie and i ...}
<P>__{(alvy's voice continues over the}
<D>__{scene shot through a window of manhattan cafe showing alvy and annie sitting at a table, laughing}
<P>__{and enjoying themselves)}
<D>__{... we had lunch sometime after that, and, uh, just, uh, kicked around old times.}
<A>__{a series of flashbacks following in quick succession while annie continues to sing: annie and alvy going up the fdr drive, the day they met playing tennis, annie driving, alvy bolding up partially eaten sandwich. annie and alvy in the hamptons house kitchen, annie banding a live lobster to alvy, who drops it in the pot on the stove. annie and alvy walking side by side by the shoreline. alvy at the tennis club, packing his bag, as he looks over his shoulder and sees annie, hands on her face, then clapping, as she offers him a ride home in her car. annie opening the door to alvy the night he came over to kill the spider; annie and, alvy in the bookstore buying the "death" titles; annie and, alvy in their hamptons house, annie reading a school catalogue, the night alvy puts in the red light. the memories continue to flash on the screen: annie and alvy at a friend's house, alvy blowing the cocaine all over the sofa; annie and alvy playing tennis; annie and alvy having a picture taken backstage at the college performance in annie's hometown; alvy bolding annie close, the night he came over to kill the spider. and continue: annie carrying her luggage and clothes into alvy's bedroom, alvy following, the day she first moved into his apartment. annie holding up her sexy birthday present from alvy, then leaning over and kissing him; annie and alvy walking down a city street, holding each other close; sitting on the park bench, observing the people; and kissing, on the fdr drive, the new york city skyline behind them. the music stops. returning to the present, the camera, focusing through the cafe window, shows annie and alvy across street. they look about at the city traffic. lunch is over; it's time. alvy and annie shake hands and kiss each other friendly like. annie crosses the street, alvy watching her go. then he turns, and slowly walks down the street off screen. his voice is heard over the scene:}
<D>__{alvy's voice over after that it got pretty late. and we both hadda go, but it was great seeing annie again, right? i realized what a terrific person she was and and how much fun it was just knowing her and i i thought of that old joke, you know, this this this guy goes to a psychiatrist and says, "doc, uh, my brother's crazy. he thinks he's a chicken." and, uh, the doctor says, "well, why don't you turn him in?" and the guy says, "i would, but i need the eggs." well, i guess that's pretty much how how i feet about relationships. you know, they're totally irrational and crazy and absurd and ... but, uh, i guess we keep goin' through it because, uh, most of us need the eggs.}
