<A>__{ and then snap open again, startled wide with fear. but this is no longer twelve year old elizabeth standing on the stern of the dauntless; this is twenty year old elizabeth, lying in bed in the dark. she remains motionless (were the images we just saw a nightmare, or a jumbled childhood memory?) elizabeth slowly looks as far out the corner of her eyes as possible without moving. might there be someone in the room with her, looming over her? she turns, ready for anything. she is alone. elizabeth sits up, turns up the flame on an oil lamp besides the canopied bed. she carries the lamp across the room to a dressing table, sits down. she pulls one of the small drawers all the way out, reaches into a space beneath it and removes the medallion. she has kept it all this time. it has not lost its luster or its sense of menace. she gazes at it as she absently returns the draw to its place a booming knock on the door; elizabeth jumps up, startled knocking over her chair.}
<C>__{swann }
<D>__{elizabeth? is everything all right? are you decent?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{yes yes.}
<A>__{she puts the medallion on, throws on a dressing gown as swann enters, carrying a large box. a uniformed maid, estrella, follows.}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{still abed at this hour? it's a beautiful day!}
<A>__{estrella pulls back the heavy curtains, revealing: beneath a blue sky lies the bucolic town of port royal, built on a natural harbor. on a bluff at the mouth of the harbor stands fort charles, its stone parapets lined with cannon.}
<C>__{swann }
<D>__{i have a gift for you.}
<A>__{he opens the boxes, and displays for her a gorgeous velvet dress. she lets out an admiring gasp.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{it's beautiful. may i inquire as to the occasion?}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?}
<A>__{elizabeth happily takes it, disappears behind a screened off dressing area. estrella follows, carrying the box.}
<C>__{swann }
<D>__{although...i did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{ceremony?}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{captain norrington's promotion ceremony.}
<A>__{elizabeth peeks around the screen.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i knew it.}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{or, rather, commodore norrington...a fine gentleman, don't you think?}
<P>__{(no answer)}
<D>__{he fancies you, you know.}
<A>__{behind the screen, elizabeth gasps.}
<C>__{swann }
<D>__{elizabeth? how's it coming?}
<A>__{on elizabeth she holds her hair and the medallion (still around her neck) out of the way as the maid cinches her into a corset over her slip. estrella has her foot in elizabeth's back as she pulls the laces tight.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{difficult ... to say.}
<C>__{swann }
<D>__{i'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in london.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<P>__{(holding her breath)}
<D>__{women in london must have learned to not breath.}
<A>__{estrella is finished. elizabeth takes a breath and winces. a butler appears in the doorway of the room.}
<C>__{butler}
<D>__{governor? a caller is here for you.}
