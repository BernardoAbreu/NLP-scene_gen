<L>__{interior buck's car. day.}
<A>__{shot of little fuzzy doll tied by a white shoestring to the rear view mirror of a car. the car is moving; the doll is bouncing up and down. in the front seat are buck and blanche barrow. buck is a jovial, simple, big hearted man. a little chubby, given to raucous jokes, knee slapping and broad reactions. he is, in many ways, the emotional opposite of his brother. it doesn't take much to make him happy. blanche, his wife, is the direct opposite of bonnie. she is a housefrau, no more and no less, not terribly bright, not very ambitious, cuddly, simpering, madly in love with buck and desirous of keeping their lives on the straight and narrow. as the scene begins we hear and then see buck, driving, singing "the great speckled bird." blanche is sitting next to him looking at a movie magazine, appearing fairly miserable.}
