<A>__{finnegan swims down to the floor of the ballast. then into a passageway lined with black pipes. pantucci right behind him. strange noises reverberate through the murky waters. creaks and moans. spooky shit. both men are wide eyed as they swim. weaving their way through a maze of pipes and ducts. the things could come out of almost anywhere. bubbles drift up from the darkness below. the music is tense...very very tense. pantucci falls behind. he swims around a curve and right into a severed human arm! air bubbles blast out of his mouth as he screams. the fingers on the dead hand seem to reach out for him. he fights his way past and swims off in a panic.}
