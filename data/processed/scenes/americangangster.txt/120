<L>__{interior frank's penthouse apartment night}
<A>__{the penthouse is now richly decorated. the r & b music playing through a state of the art stereo system. it's a kind of office party for frank's brothers, cousins, wives and girlfriends, distributors like rossi and other east harlem guys, charlie williams, couple of cops on frank's payroll, and the chemical bank vice president.}

<C>__{sibota}
<D>__{so i hear. you have him come see me. we'll give him a try out.}
<A>__{as the scout hands his card to frank, we whip over to where teddy, his driver jimmy racine and their girlfriends, coked up, are laughing as a black cop, flashing his detective's shield, pretends to frisk jimmy.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{what's this?}
<P>__{(taking a .45 from jimmy's pocket)}

<C>__{detective}
<D>__{what is that, a bribe? oh, now you're all under arrest.}

<D>__{i said, what the fuck was that?}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{what was what?}
<A>__{the room explodes with a boom and the detective crumples to the floor, clutching at his leg, blood running through his fingers onto the carpet. frank stares.}
