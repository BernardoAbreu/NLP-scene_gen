<L>__{exterior turner plantation night}
<A>__{ february march, 1847 alone out on the edge of the bayou, solomon is playing a low air on his violin while snacking on scraps of bacon. as he plays, something appears in the distance. from the edge of the bayou, coming forth like an apparition arisen from the earth, is celeste. she is a young woman of about 19 years of age and far whiter than most blacks. "it required close inspection to distinguish in her feature the slightest trace of african blood." beyond that, she is pale and haggard, but still lovely. dressed in a white gown, she emerges from the water. draped on her dress, her period. a line in her skirt. it's very visible, but not shocking. a ribbon of red in her dress. celeste moves to solomon without fear or hesitation. as solomon, startled, takes her in, celeste says quite plainly:}
<C>__{celeste}
<D>__{i am hungry. give me food.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{celeste}
<D>__{i'm hungry.}
<A>__{solomon gives celeste some of his food. celeste, famished, devours it.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{what is your name?}
<C>__{celeste}
<D>__{my name is celeste.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{what are your circumstances?}
<C>__{celeste}
<D>__{i belong ta massa carey, and 'ave been two days among da palmettoes. celeste is sick and cain't work, and would rather die in the swamp}
<C>__{celeste }
<D>__{than be whipped to death by the overseer. so i took myself away. massa's dogs won't follow me. the patrollers 'ave tried to set dem on me. but dey a secret between dem and celeste, and dey won't mind the devilish orders of the overseer.}
<A>__{celeste lifts her head from the food on which she gnaws.}
<C>__{celeste }
<D>__{do you believe me?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{celeste}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{there are some whose tracks the hounds will refuse to follow.}
<C>__{celeste}
<D>__{give me more food. i'm starvin'.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{this is all my allowance for the rest of }
<C>__{celeste}
<D>__{give it to me.}
<A>__{almost as if compelled, solomon does as ordered. as she eats, celeste aggrandizes herself:}
<C>__{celeste }
<D>__{most slaves escape at night. the overseers are alert for such chicanes. but celeste tricked dem 'n alight in the middle of the day wit the sun up at its highest. the place of my concealment now deep in the swamp, not half a mile from massa's plantation, and a world apart. a world a tall trees whose long arms make fo' a canopy so dense dey keep away even the beams of the sun. it twilight always in celeste's world, even in the brightest day. i will live there, and i will live freely. the overseers are a cowardly lot. dey will not go where their dogs show fear and where it always be night. others will join me in the twilight, and we ain't gunna be slaves no 'mo forever}
<A>__{solomon isn't sure what to say. before he can say anything:}
<C>__{celeste }
<D>__{celeste will come to you again in the night. you will have food for her.}
<A>__{celeste departs the way she came; as though she were a vision.}
