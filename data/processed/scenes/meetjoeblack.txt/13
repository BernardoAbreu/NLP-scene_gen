<A>__{the busy medical community at 68th street and new york avenue.}
<L>__{interior corinth coffee shop, new york avenue day}
<A>__{a thriving eatery diagonally across from the hospital's entrance, customers cheek by jowl as a pair of waiters juggle breakfasts served to a noisy throng of doctors, residents and interns. susan has squeezed into a seat in the corner. a counterman, with a smile and a greeting, places a cup of coffee in front of her. a sense this is a daily ritual, arming herself for the day; immediately she becomes aware of a man behind her speaking into the pay phone. an attractive young man, early 30's, a pair of suitcase at his feet, a raincoat slung over his shoulder.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{...honey, you've got to go on... there's a time to sow and a time to reap, you sow now and forget about him... yeah, i liked him, i don't like him anymore... because you're my honey and anybody messes with you messes with me i'm on a plane in a minute... as soon as i get my phone in, you're my first call, that's a promise... where you going now?... good, hit the books, get that degree, one day we'll hang out a shingle together... you bet, honey... later.}
<A>__{the young man hangs up, turns around and sits down to an overflowing plate of eggs and meat, potatoes and toast, the counterman refills his cup and the young man ties into the breakfast, eating it with such relish that susan can't take her eyes off him. he senses her eyes, glances over, his cheeks filled with a mouthful of food, swallows embarrassedly.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{good morning, i was talking kind of loud there, sorry.}
<C>__{susan}

<C>__{young man}
<D>__{i'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with honey's guy. he was fooling around and honey caught him at it. one girlfriend wasn't enough for him.}
