<A>__{movietone newsreel continues. the british press are gathered in a huge victorian parlor. dark woods, rich leather, a bank of microphones, an electric expectancy... bill and slim stand next to a seated amy. amelia steps to the microphones...}

<D>__{i was a passenger on this journey. just a passenger. everything that was done to bring us across was done by wilmer stultz and slim gordon. all the praise...}
<C>__{reporter}
<P>__{(calls out)}
<D>__{but you can fly, can't you?}
<A>__{amelia stares at the man. conflicting agendas.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{this flight was solely to the credit of bill and slim. women should know, however, that i have had 500 hours solo flying and once held the women's altitude record.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{so you could have done it yourself!}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{this particular flight, under these conditions, i wonder if anyone but bill stultz could have pulled it off. but certainly, one day a woman will do this. as easily, as skillfully, as professionally as any man.}
<A>__{such calm self possession. such confidence in that.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{aviation is clear today for the pioneer. and if the pioneer has good ideas nobody will ask whether the pioneer is a man or woman.}
<A>__{polite applause. mostly from women. she looks around the room.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{i hear your doubt. that doubt is our challenge. this is where our atlantic flight, or any other good flight by a woman can help...}
<A>__{she nods. to them, to herself.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{it starts women thinking.}
