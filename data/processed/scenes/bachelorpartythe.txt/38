<A>__{charlie in booth. the broad grin has disappeared from his face. as seen through the closed glass doors of the booth, he is a very sullen and despondent young man. he stands now, pushes the doors open, and comes out. camera pulls back so that we can see the whole area of the bar near the phone booths. next to the phone booth are two doors marked guys and dolls. kenneth is coming in from the deeper recesses of the bar where the other members of the bachelor party are grouped in a booth. he is headed for the door marked guys. charlie regards kenneth bleakly as he approaches.}
