<P>__{(to joyce)}
<D>__{you know this guy?}

<D>__{i'm beginning to wonder.}
<A>__{the letterman regular takes a seat as he watches the monitor. he seems more intrigued than joyce. letterman show stock footage}
<C>__{letterman}
<D>__{but i have a feeling though, if you wanted to, you could probably get by on what you make selling your work. because i know people are after you to write other things. you're publishing this anthology...}

<C>__{harvey}

<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{i'm no show biz phoney. i'm telling the truth. come on, man.}
