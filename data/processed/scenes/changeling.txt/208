<A>__{christine and ybarra watch as mr. and mrs. clay lead their son into their car. as they drive off, christine finally breaks the silence.}

<A>__{changeling a true story}
<C>__{ybarra }
<D>__{and he wouldn't be, if it wasn't for walter.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{your son did a brave thing, mrs. collins. you should be very proud of him.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{ybarra}
<D>__{you don't think he's still out there, do you?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{why not? three boys made a run for it that night, detective. if one got out, maybe either or both of the others did too. maybe walter went through the same fears he did. afraid to come home or identify himself, afraid he'd get into trouble, that people might think it was his fault. either way, it gives me something i didn't have before tonight.}
<C>__{ybarra}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{she looks at him...and smiles.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{hope.}
<A>__{she turns and walks off into the night, as we superimpose: gordon stewart northcott was hanged on october 2, 1935 in exchange for his cooperation and a guilty plea, sanford wesley clark was sentenced to the whittier state school for boys for five years. upon being released in 1934, he returned home to canada, and was never heard from again. upon returning to duty after his suspension, captain j. j. jones was demoted to lieutenant and subsequently sued by christine collins in civil court. he was found guilty and fined $10,800 (equal to $125,000 in 2006 dollars). he never paid. one year after the city council recommended the removal of the los angeles chief of police, james e davis resigned from office and was replaced by roy e. steckel. changeling a true story davis reclaimed that office in 1933, where he created the red squad, notorious for attacking communists and their offices, but was forced to resign a second time under a cloud of police corruption. in the aftermath of the city council hearings, the criminal justice system in california was revised to prevent women from being incarcerated or institutionalized for the crime of disagreeing with a male police officer. strict medical procedures were set in place to prevent future abuse. in november 1929, los angeles mayor george e. cryer was voted out of office after three terms. he was later found to have been the front man for the crawford organized crime syndicate, which ran prostitution and gambling rackets throughout southern california. for the rest of his life, reverend gustav a. briegleb used his radio show to expose police misconduct and political corruption. he also published "the layman's handbook of daniel." the california community of wineville, near riverside, became synonymous with the infamous northcott murder ranch. in order to shake free of the scandal, the residents changed its name to mira loma. christine collins never stopped searching for her son. the fate of walter collins remains a mystery. if he was able to escape the northcott ranch, he would be 86 years old today.}
