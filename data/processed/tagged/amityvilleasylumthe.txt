<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{well an institution such as this one is a very different proposition.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{oh yes. yes i know. you'll see i've also worked cleaning a school, so i am used to big areas.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{yes i've seen that. when i say this is a different proposition i mean in terms of the sensitivity required due to the nature of what we do here.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{oh yes, yes of course.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{you would mainly be working night shifts at a time when patients are on lock down. but many of our patients here have psychological disturbances so there may be situations where you have to clean up things you may not be used to cleaning up. if you know what i'm saying.}

<D>__{i know what you mean, yes.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{would that bother you?}

<D>__{it may be strange at first but i actually have some experience in}

<A>__{i see. how is your mother now?}
<C>__{lisa}
<A>__{well... she passed away.}
<C>__{mixter}
<A>__{i'm sorry to hear that. so... it's important to me that every employee here, whether they are a psychiatrist, an orderly or a cleaner, needs to fully understand what our mission statement at this hospital is.}
<C>__{lisa}
<A>__{okay.}
<C>__{mixter}
<A>__{high hopes was only built two years ago and as an institution we have only been running for just over a year now. so we're still building our reputation. but i am very clear on what i want that reputation to be. i intend to make this institution one of the foremost centres for mental health treatment in the country. if you look into my history you'll know that i have a stellar reputation in the field of psychiatry and i want to use that to help others. that is why i have put my own money into the creation of this institution. we are only just starting out but we have a long term ambition to be considered the best. so what i require is that every person who works at this institution, in any capacity, must be professional and sensitive to the needs of the patients. unlike other institutions, the welfare and care of our patients comes first here.}

<D>__{this is the storage cupboard. everything you will need for each task is here, each shelf is labelled.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{the most obvious task is hoovering. this is our hoover here, it's straight forward. you'll be surprised that although it's powerful it's very quiet, because we are working when everyone's in bed so obviously we don't want to wake them up! it has a telescopic suction tube and six stage filter system. so a lot more powerful than you may be used to.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{the mop and bucket is here, we usually use standard bleach to mix with the water so that's straight forward. but there is this specialist stain remover that you must use if there are any stains on the floor or carpet. it needs to be sprayed and left to set for twenty minutes before scrubbing or mopping. it's a special formula for tea, coffee, water marks and other yellow and brown discolourations on the carpets or floors. it's pretty strong so wash your hands after you use it!}
<C>__{lisa}
<C>__{okay}
<C>__{delaney}

<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{gross!}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{yes! i think a lot of the time it's the staff doing it, not the patients! but we have this gumcart, which is a bit complicated but it's easier than just scraping the gum. the steam is super heated to one hundred eighty degrees and delivered at seven point zero bar pressure. it can produce a hundred and fifteen litres of superheated steam per minute.}

<D>__{no problem. now here we come to the most dangerous chemical we have. this is a concrete cleaner, very toxic stuff, so you have to wear the face mask and gloves we have here, okay?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{this is for cleaning and descaling brick, stone and concrete and for metal de rusting. for concrete you must mix it one part to four parts water. brush or spray it on with the equipment here then leave it five to ten minutes to set, then rinse it off. but for those stubborn son of a bitch marks use it neat!}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{delaney}

<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{she was a member of a witchcraft cult. they kidnapped six people for a demonic ritual. five were killed but one got away and led police to the cult. she turned her trial into a circus, talking about lots of crazy stuff. the media enjoyed it but she got certified insane by the court. she's been around a few institutions since. now she's here.}

<D>__{they first brought him in about six months ago. no one knows where he came from, he literally just turned up late one night. an orderly found him wandering the grounds. first of all he was like missus hardesty upstairs catatonic. then a few weeks later he started to respond to doctor mixter and the nurses through facial expressions and gestures. but soon, he got violent. very violent. he'd have bursts of rage and beat other patients. one day he appeared to have a seizure and collapsed. a young doctor tried to take his vital signs. patient x here throttled him so hard he crushed his larynx. it took six orderlies to restrain him. now they won't even let him out for the obligatory hour a day exercise. we still don't know who he is.}

<D>__{i don't think that's true. if i've learnt anything from the patients on ward x, it's that some people have a mind that works in a different way to other people. those people who do bad things have fed the evil within them more than the good. it's not possession, it's sickness. sickness of the soul.}

<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{yes that's right. i'm writing a college paper and i had heard some rumours in the neighbourhood about native americans being killed on the land down on oceans avenue.}

<D>__{yeah it's awful.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{you know most of the town was very upset when they decided to build that mental institution on the land. that used to be a nice suburban neighbourhood, now there's this big eye sore there. we had a thousand names on a petition. but i guess that doctor who runs the place has enough money to pay off the people in high places.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{so what about the native americans? is that story about them being killed on that land true?}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{there's something on that here.}
<A>__{gloria flips through one of the books.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{ah yes, here it is. (reading) in the 18th century there existed a group of native americans in amityville known as "the satchem tribe" led by satchem takapausha, the chief. the tribe had fled salem in massachusetts to escape persecution by the christians who were persecuting members of the tribe because of their witchcraft practices. these practices included a ritualistic human sacrifice of six people (the significance of six being related to the biblical number of man and creation) in order to induce the spirit of their god, the dark master, who they believed manifested his powers through his devoted followers, giving them immortality. the hundred strong tribe settled in amityville but were later chased off the land by local christians. satchem accused the christians of not properly compensating his tribe for the land. a war started and the christians hired a hunter called john underhill from salem. at the site where one twelve oceans avenue was later built in amityville, underhill killed all of the tribe. the indians were buried in a mass grave on the site. before he died satchem vowed revenge. according to local legend, chief satchem is believed to have subsequently haunted the land. various parapsychologists and mediums have claimed that satchem's vengeful spirit influenced the 1974 defeo murders at one twelve oceans avenue and the haunting of the subsequent owners. although such assertions are widely disputed.}

<D>__{then someone is helping her get access to this stuff! someone who works here! please doctor mixter. just check out her cell and speak to her. if i'm wrong about this and it's all just her delusions then fine. i will accept that. but i had to tell you. you testified at her trial didn't you?}

<C>__{lisa}

<A>__{bang! the shot gun blasts a hole through patient x's chest, blood splatters over lisa. suddenly a white light fills the room and allison defeo materialises. she is dressed in a clean white dress, her angelic complexion bears no wounds. allison takes the hand of patient x's corpse. the white light swarms over patient x's body and he rises to his feet. his head is now intact and he is dressed in a white robe. he looks at allison and they share a peaceful smile. allison walks with patient x through a doorway filled with a blinding white light. they disappear and the light slowly dissipates.}

<D>__{morning katherine, how are you?}
<C>__{presenter}
<D>__{i'm good thank you. so doctor, can you tell us a little more about the book?}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{well, it features a blow by blow account of the evening. it was obviously a very harrowing experience and for me it was rather therapeutic to deal with my feelings about what happened in writing.}
<C>__{presenter}
<D>__{how has it affected the hospital doctor?}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{obviously we were all left very numb by events for a long time and i know a lot of people in the town felt we should close the institution. but that never occurred to me. i feel that people should be brought closer by tragedy and the staff and i have definitely become closer, both as colleagues and friends, since the incident. that bond makes for a better institution in my opinion, so we will continue to go from strength to strength.}
<C>__{presenter}
<D>__{you mentioned there that some people wanted the place to close. i know many were also resistant to the opening of the institution in the first place given that it was built on the site of the infamous house, where ronald defeo murdered his family in the seventies. i know a lot of people associated with that case were accused of exploiting it for their own ends. you've also faced some criticism for that, particularly as we heard last week that you have sold the movie rights to this book. how do you respond to that criticism?}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{well i know that some people accuse me of hurting the memory of the victims but i feel i'm helping the memories of those involved live on. granted, some victims were criminally insane but other victims were loyal staff who had families and i'm determined that they not be forgotten. each staff member gets their own chapter in the book so that the readers can get a full picture of what wonderful people they were. i always say that all forms of media, whether it be books, newspapers, tv or movies, are a preservation of life. our physical bodies may die but our images live on when we are famous. our work and our passion is preserved, therefore it's as if our souls are preserved. through all of these forms of media we are, in effect, immortal.}
