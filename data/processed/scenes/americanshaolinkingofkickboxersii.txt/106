<L>__{interior san de chamber evening}
<B>__{establishing shot of san de and the girls school headmistress.}
<A>__{also in the room are two high ranking police officials. the headmistress is yelling at the top of her lungs, and san de is just sitting there, letting her vent. she has obviously been going at it for some time, because her face is sweaty and flushed. she stops when drew and the d.s. enter and points an accusing finger at drew.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{he's the one!}
<C>__{san de}
<D>__{drew, i think you know headmistress low. correct?}
<A>__{drew can only nod.}
<C>__{san de }
<D>__{the police have also come. a morals violation is what brought them...}
<A>__{drew's head snaps up at the words "morals charge"}
<C>__{police lieutenant}
<D>__{we demand that he leaves the temple, and china!}
<C>__{police captain}
<D>__{he's a disgrace, to the temple and to this country. he must leave.}
<A>__{they all agree that drew should leave, and for a moment the sound of the three of them agreeing fills the room (ad libs).}
<B>__{angle on drew}
<A>__{who is staring down into the abyss.}
<C>__{san de}
<D>__{this is a serious issue, there is no question. this we will have to take under advisement but we will handle matters of this temple.}
<C>__{police captain}
<D>__{this involves more than just the temple. i am authorized to escort him from your temple to the jail now, tonight, where he will be held until he leaves the country.}
<A>__{san de pauses, letting this sink in. the d.s. steps forward.}
<C>__{d.s.}
<D>__{master, may i?}
<P>__{(san de nods)}
<D>__{we accepted a challenge when this disciple came into our ranks. if we force him to leave china, we admit failure. can we do that?}
<A>__{the police don't have an easy answer to that.}
<B>__{angle on drew}
<A>__{who is surprised that the d.s. is sticking up for him.}
<C>__{d.s.}
<D>__{you are wise. you know what is right and what is not right. this disciple does not even know right from wrong. who will teach him if we do not?}
<A>__{this sinks in, and the police have nothing to say. the headmistress will not keep quiet, however.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{he does not belong here!}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(whisper)}
<D>__{chill out, honey!}
<A>__{drew catches a hard look from the d.s.}
<C>__{d.s.}
<D>__{would you be so hard hearted as to turn him away from that which he so desperately needs?}
<A>__{she is about to speak, but thinks better of it. san de stands up, signalling that the meeting is over.}
<C>__{san de}
<D>__{thank you all for coming. i am pleased that you brought this problem to our attention. may you sleep well tonight knowing that the situation has been swiftly resolved.}
<C>__{police captain}
<D>__{i do not wish to visit you again with this kind of news.}
<C>__{san de}
<D>__{you will not have to.}
<A>__{the headmistress starts to say something, but san de holds up his hand, stopping her. he leads them out, then closes the door and comes back to face drew.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{master, i can't tell you how sorry i am. i appreciate you both going to bat like that for me. i won't let it happen again.}
<C>__{san de}
<D>__{neither will we. you must leave the temple in the morning.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{but i thought... the police...}
<C>__{d.s.}
<D>__{you do not deserve to leave the country as a criminal, but you cannot stay.}
<A>__{drew sits for a moment, looking back and forth between san de and the d.s. his eyes are filling with tears, and he wipes at them.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{i'm sorry, master.}
<C>__{san de}
<D>__{as am i.}
<A>__{drew gets up and walks out of the chamber.}
