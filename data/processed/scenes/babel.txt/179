<L>__{interior room, anwar's house afternoon}
<D>__{night begins to fall. from the window we can hear the noises of the town: voices, goats bleating, camels moaning, music from a radio. susan wakes from her slumber and turns to richard, who is leaning on a wall, tired, sweaty, with his eyes closed.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{richard.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{what do you need?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{richard... if i die, take care of the kids. especially mike, he really needs you.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{you're not going to die. you can't die. you just can't.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{don't ever leave them again.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{no, i'm not going to leave them and don't you even think about leaving me, because i will kill you like nobody's killed you before. she smiles. he caresses her.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i peed my pants.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i couldn't hold it in and i peed.}
<A>__{richard touches between her legs and feels the moisture.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{i'm going to tell mike on you, so you never scold him again.}
<A>__{they both laugh. she grimaces in pain when she does.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i need to pee again.}
<C>__{richard}
<P>__{(to anwar)}
<D>__{do you have a pot i can borrow?}
<A>__{anwar looks in a corner and hands it over.}
<C>__{richard }
<P>__{(to anwar)}
<D>__{can you leave us alone for a moment?}
<A>__{the grandmother and anwar exit.}
<C>__{richard }
<D>__{come, try it like this.}
<A>__{he lifts up her dress, pulls down her underpants and sets the basin under her. she puts her arm around him to pull herself up, but can't move her right arm.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i can't.}
<A>__{they laugh. he kisses her. we start to hear the stream.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{now i can.}
<A>__{while she pees, they kiss painfully. she starts to cry.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{forgive me my love. when pat died i didn't know what to do, the pain drove me crazy... i was scared, that's why i left... forgive me.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i was scared too... when i saw pat lying still in his crib...}
<A>__{her voice breaks up and she can barely go on.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{it wasn't my fault, it wasn't... i couldn't do anything for him...}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{no, it wasn't your fault. i was wrong... he strokes her head.}
<C>__{richard }
<D>__{shhh... it wasn't your fault my love, it wasn't anybody's fault... pat just left...}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{forgive me, please.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{forgive me for not forgiving you. richard hugs her and starts to laugh.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{you missed; you got my leg. they both laugh, and as they do, the blanket covering susan's wound slips off. richard sees her swollen, bruised arm. he touches it.}
<C>__{richard }
<D>__{does it hurt?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{so much... so much... richard looks worried and leaves the room.}
