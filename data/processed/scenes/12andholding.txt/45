<L>__{exterior woods three weeks later afternoon}
<A>__{tight on a chain saw chopping down a tree. widen to reveal a construction crew, tearing down the last of the woods. rows and rows of stumps make it look like a graveyard for trees.}
<C>__{malee }
<D>__{it's gone! it's all gone!}
<A>__{we find malee and jacob, straddling their bikes a few feet away from the site. leonard is beside them on a scooter. he as a band aid on his forehead.}
<C>__{malee }
<D>__{if rudy was alive, he'd be freaking out right now.}
<A>__{leonard shoots malee a look. she silences herself.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{you holding up alright, jacob?}
<A>__{jacob shrugs.}
<C>__{leonard }
<D>__{i'm sorry. i wish i could have done something.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{jeff and kenny were the ones that started the fire. it was their fault. or maybe mine. i should of been there.}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{you wouldn't have been able to do anything. and it could have been you who died.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i wish it was. you know the last thing rudy said to me? he said, i can't be a pussy all my life. he was right, i am. and rudy might be dead because of it.}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{don't say that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why don't you talk to your parents about this?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{they can't help me.}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{give them time. it'll get better.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what if it doesn't? my dad hasn't gone back to work yet. what if he loses his job. we could lose our house. i could be homeless.}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{then you'll stay with me.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{or me.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{we're best friends. we...}
<A>__{suddenly, something catches malee's attention off screen. it's gus, standing beside a bulldozer.}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{that guy. i like know him. he's one of my mother's patients.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{i've never seen a patient of hers actually out and about.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{should we go over and say "hi"?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i just want to get out of here.}
<A>__{leonard and jacob start heading off. malee stays for a beat, eyeing gus as he removes his t shirt and exposes his rock abs. she is obviously turned on.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{you coming, malee?}
