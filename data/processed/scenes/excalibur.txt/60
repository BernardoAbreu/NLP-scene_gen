<A>__{the old knight rushes after the boy, sword drawn, to defend his flank, and the others follow, a battle cry issuing from them that is terrifying in its fierceness.}

<L>__{exterior outside the castle night}
<A>__{arthur fights like a wounded lion at the center of the savage melee of sword and shield, and once again the two sides fall apart. uryens and lot are standing in the moat among the bodies of their men, are reduced to eleven knights, all wounded. arthur is flanked by twenty men at arms, most of them wounded, and trembling now beyond exhaustion with blood lust. arthur steps forward alone, and addresses his opponents.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you are in my hands, to slay or spare. i need battle lords such as you. swear faith to me and you shall have mercy.}
<C>__{uryens}
<D>__{noble knights swear faith to a mere squire?}
<A>__{arthur turns, searching for merlin. he spots him watching from a distance. they stare at each other, merlin implacable, arthur's eyes pleading. it's obvious that merlin isn't going to help.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you are right. i'm not yet a knight.}
<P>__{(gaining strength)}
<D>__{you, uryens, will knight me.}
<A>__{he unsheathes excalibur and goes forward, kneeling before uryens and offering him the sword.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{then as knight to knight i can offer you mercy.}
<C>__{merlin}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{what's this, what's this?!}
<A>__{arthur, kneeling, bows his head and uryens steps up to him, his features set. he accepts the sword. lot watches, a mad hope dancing in his eyes.}
