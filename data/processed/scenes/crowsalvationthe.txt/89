<A>__{erin exits the front door and we see her framed against the huge house, a rich man's castle built in the twenties of quarried stone, quarter sawn oak and leaded glass. erin, like her sister, a child of privilege. she approaches alex.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{daisy. how did you know?}

<C>__{erin}
<D>__{i know who you are.}
<P>__{(no response)}

<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i'm not hiding. i'm right here.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{you killed lauren! you killed her!}
<A>__{erin shakes her head, trying to absorb what's going on, then rushes alex, screaming, beating on him, fists of fury.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{not me. dirty cops killed her. dutton, erlich...}
<A>__{alex tries to handle her flailing arms but she's too manic. he's getting hit in the face, the chest, and it's hurting. he grabs her roughly, gets her to stop.}

<D>__{no! why are you haunting me?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{because you need to understand. and you need... to be careful.}
<A>__{he tries to give it to her one more time, then flips the card through the air. she turns, watching its flight all the way to the landing by the front door...}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{i'm sorry. your father wasn't right.}
<A>__{she turns back and... he's gone. erin walks to the door. despite herself reaches for the card on the landing. it's... the corvette registration which we see clearly for the first time. owned by a company called delt. the address is}
