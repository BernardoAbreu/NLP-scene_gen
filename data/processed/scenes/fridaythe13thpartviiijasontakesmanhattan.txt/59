<L>__{exterior tamara's stateroom stalking point of view}
<A>__{as we approach her door, still cracked open from mcculloch's entrance. we get there just in time to see tamara slip her arms around mcculloch, planting her lips on his, pressing her nubile flesh up against his stiffly starched shirt.}
<L>__{interior tamara's stateroom continuous}
<A>__{as she holds him tight. he finally breaks away in a fit of anger.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{oh, you've done it now. not only are you going home, i will see to it that you spend next year back in a high school classroom!}
<A>__{he storms for the door, swinging it open, coming face to face with:}
<B>__{wayne}
<A>__{who casually lowers his camcorder.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{i don't think so, mr. mcculloch.}
<P>__{(to wayne)}
<D>__{did you get anything good?}
<A>__{his eyes are unable to leave her nakedness.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{oh yeah.}
<A>__{she quickly slips on her robe again, all business. mcculloch realizes what has just transpired.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{you'll never get away with it.}
<P>__{(eyeing wayne)}
<D>__{and you can forget about ever attending any film school.}
<P>__{(serious beat)}
<D>__{you're both going to be very, very sorry.}
<A>__{he storms off. wayne looks very, very nervous. tamara steps over to him, cuddling up.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{relax, wayne. he won't risk doing a thing.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{can i have the tape?}
<A>__{he pops the eject button, absently handing it over. wayne steps into her room, nervous and excited to be there. he lifts the glass of champagne she poured for mcculloch.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{this is going to sound supremely lame...but i've had the major hots for you since our sophomore year, tamara.}
<A>__{he gulps down the fizz. she forces a smile, stashing the incriminating videotape.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{that's sweet, wayne. look, i'd love to chat but i'm really pressed for time.}
<P>__{(ushering him to door)}
<D>__{let's try to get together later, okey doke?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{but i thought...}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{thanks for the camerawork.}
<A>__{and out he goes, the door shut in his face. wayne stands outside her room, realizing he's a major chump.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{wayne, you're an asshole.}
<A>__{he despondently exits.}
