<L>__{interior pie shop day}
<A>__{behind the dusty counter is... mrs. lovett, a venal, vigorous and slatternly woman in her}
<L>__{40's.}
<A>__{she is currently busy chopping a loathsome mess of suet with a wicked looking knife, her greasy hair hanging down over her face. the moment todd enters and the bell at the door sounds her head snaps up and her eyes are on him like a bird of prey:}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{a customer!}
<A>__{todd is startled, starts to go }
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{wait! what's yer rush? what's yer hurry?}
<P>__{(she sticks the knife into the counter)}
<D>__{you gave me such a }
<P>__{(wipes her hands on her}
<D>__{apron) ) fright. i thought you was a ghost. half a minute, can'tcher? sit! sit ye down!}
<P>__{(an order)}
<D>__{sit!}
<P>__{(he obeys)}
<D>__{all i meant is that i haven't seen a customer for weeks. did you come here for a pie, sir?}
<P>__{(todd nods. she flicks a}
<D>__{bit of dust off a pie}
<P>__{with a rag)}
<D>__{do forgive me if me head's a little vague ugh!}
<P>__{(she plucks something off the pie, examines it)}
<D>__{what is that? but you'd think we had the plague }
<P>__{(she drops it on the floor and stamps on it)}
<D>__{from the way that people }
<P>__{(she flicks something off the pie with her finger)}
<D>__{keep avoiding }
<P>__{(spotting it moving)}
<D>__{no, you don't!}
<P>__{(she smacks it with her hand)}
<D>__{heaven knows i try, sir!}
<P>__{(lifts her hand, looks at it)}
<D>__{tsk!}
<P>__{(she wipes it on the edge of the counter)}
<D>__{but there's no one comes in even to inhale tsk!}
<P>__{(she blows the last dust}
<D>__{off the pie as she brings}
<P>__{it to him)}
<D>__{right you are, sir. would you like a drop of ale?}
<P>__{(todd nods)}
<D>__{mind you, i can't hardly blame them }
<P>__{(pouring a tankard of ale)}
<D>__{these are probably the worst pies in london. i know why nobody cares to take them i should know, i make them. but good? no, the worst pies in london even that's polite. the worst pies in london if you doubt it, take a bite.}
<P>__{(he does. it's horrible)}
<D>__{is that just disgusting? you have to concede it. it's nothing but crusting here, drink this, you'll need it }
<P>__{(she gives him the ale)}
<D>__{the worst pies in london.}
<A>__{during the following, she slams lumps of dough on the counter and rolls them out, grunting frequently as she goes:}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{and no wonder with the price of meat what it is }
<P>__{(grunt)}
<D>__{when you get it.}
<P>__{(grunt)}
<D>__{never}
<P>__{(grunt)}
<D>__{thought i'd live to see the day men'd think it was a treat finding poor}
<P>__{(grunt)}
<D>__{animals}
<P>__{(grunt)}
<D>__{wot are dying in the street. mrs. mooney has a pie shop, does a business, but i noticed something weird lately all her neighbors' cats have disappeared.}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{have to hand it to her wot i calls enterprise, popping pussies into pies. wouldn't do in my shop just the thought of it's enough to make you sick. and i'm telling you them pussy cats is quick.}
<P>__{(leans on counter, exhausted)}
<D>__{no denying times is hard, sir even harder than the worst pies in london. only lard and nothing more }
<P>__{(as todd gamely tries another mouthful)}
<D>__{is that just revolting? all greasy and gritty, it looks like it's molting, and tastes like well, pity a woman alone with limited wind and the worst pies in london!}
<P>__{(sighs heavily)}
<D>__{ah sir, times is hard. times is hard.}
<A>__{she finishes one of the crusts with a flourish as the music ends. todd, meanwhile, is gulping at his ale, trying to wash down mrs. lovett's hideous creation.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{trust me, dearie, it's going to take more than ale to wash that taste out. come with me and we'll get you a nice tumbler of gin.}
<A>__{she leads him through the curtains at the back of the pie shop and into...}
