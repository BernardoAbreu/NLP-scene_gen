<D>__{did you read about a boat that washed up outside of new orleans about four months ago? twelve bodies on board.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{who didn't? big news. out of brazil, wasn't it?}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{yes. that's my case. now it's yours. all the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. decapitated. brains extracted. limbs torn to shreds. it looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{so the method of death is the only connection?}
<C>__{pendergast}

<C>__{pendergast}
