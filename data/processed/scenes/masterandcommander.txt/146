<L>__{150. ocean day}
<A>__{wide to see the two ships. the surprise and the acheron with a mile of sea between them. it's like some great ocean race, with neither prepared to take in canvas despite the appalling conditions.}
<L>__{151. quarterdeck later, day}
<A>__{they are running fast before a dangerous, following sea: a landscape of hills and valleys, the whole thing in terrifying motion. the forecastle now vanishes in foam with every plunge, rising each time with water pouring over the waist and spouting from her scuppers. killick comes up with the coffee pot inside his jacket. jack drinks from the spout, peering ahead into the murk. a wild unruly part of him is loving this. above him, more top men struggle up the rigging, with the mast drawing crazy figure of eights on a rushing sky.}
