<L>__{interior big top night}
<A>__{amos leans over so karl can sign a contract on his back. he spots edward walking back into the tent.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{hey kid! your friend just made himself a star.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{that's great.}
<A>__{amos hands off the contract to a clown.}
<P>__{(introducing)}
<D>__{my attorney, mr. soggybottom.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{good to meet you.}
<A>__{mr. soggybottom honks his horn, then waddles off.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{what's the matter with you, kid? i haven't seen a customer so depressed since the elephant sat on that farmer's wife.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{get it? "depressed?"}
<A>__{karl chuckles.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{see! the big guy likes it.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i just saw the woman i'm going to marry, i know it. but then i lost her.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{tough break. most men have to get married before they lose their wives.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(with absolute conviction)}
<D>__{i'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. that or die alone.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{jesus, kid.}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{let me guess. real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{i know her uncle. friends of the family.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{who is she? where does she live?}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{kid. don't waste your time. she's out of your league.}
<A>__{as amos starts to walk away, edward hurries to catch up with him. karl follows as well.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{what do you mean? you don't even know me.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{sure i do. you were hot shit back in hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. you don't have a plan. you don't have a job. you don't have anything but the clothes on your back.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i've got a whole backpack full of clothes!}
<A>__{he points to the bleachers, where no backpack is to be found.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{someone stole my backpack.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. this here is the ocean, and you're drowning. take my advice and go back to puddleville. you'll be happy there.}
<A>__{getting in front of amos, edward stops him.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{wait. you said i don't have a plan. i do. i'm going to find that girl and marry her and spend the rest of my life with her.}
<A>__{amos smiles, amused.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i don't have a job, but i would have a job if you gave me one. and i may not have much, but i have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{sorry, kid. i don't do charity.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i will work night and day, and you won't have to pay me. you just have to tell me who she is.}
<A>__{amos takes a long look at him. ultimately, there's no way he can say no. he shrugs. what the hell.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{every month you work for me, i will tell you one thing about her. that's my final offer.}
<A>__{edward shakes amos's hand before he can retract the offer. we move into a montage:}
