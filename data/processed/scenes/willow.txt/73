<A>__{willow hugs the baby while he sits between madmartigan's legs, and the shield zooms down the moun tain, zig zagging through trees. madmartigan steers by using sorsha's sword as a ski pole. the nockmaar horsemen gallop after them. the shield skips and flies over snowdrifts and bumps. raziel squawks in terror above them. just missing trees and rocks, they pick up speek. their eyes sud denly widen. dead ahead is a huge wall of ice!}
