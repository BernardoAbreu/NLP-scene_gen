<L>__{interior theatre morning}
<A>__{stan inside. it's as if he's just teleported into beirut. weapons, hummers, a huge armored bus is jacked up at one end of the theatre. gabriel's men go about readying themselves. one of the mercs walks over to gabriel to show a modified electronic dog collar.}
<C>__{stanley}
<P>__{(realization hitting him)}
<D>__{you're going into the fucking bank.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{that's what i'm telling you, stanley. we are at war.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{war? who are we at war with?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{anyone who infringes on america's freedom. terrorists' states, stanley. someone must take their war to them. they bomb a church, we bomb ten. they hijack a plane, we take out an airport. they execute american tourists, we tactically nuke an entire city. we must make terrorism so horrific that it becomes unthinkable to attack americans.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{i'm out. i'm not doing this. you're insane.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{maybe. i wanted you to do this because you wanted to, because we need men like you, but our time table's been moved up. just relax and it will all be over in twenty four hours. you're rich, stanley. pretty soon holly and you will be basking in the sun on the deck of some eighty foot scarab, eating bon bons and living the good life.}
<A>__{he turns to walk off. stanley looks around. he spots a generator and moves toward it. stanley reaches down to the power board on the generator and gives a large dial a twist. suddenly, the hundreds of lights in the rack begin to arc. in a shower of glass they start exploding from the huge amperage shooting through them from the generator. gabriel turns to see stan standing next to the generator. he moves toward him just as the room goes black. in a moment the secondary lights come up. no stanley.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{pretty slick.}
<C>__{marco}
<P>__{(walking over)}
<D>__{you want to send a team after him?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{no. he'll be back. we gotta move. load up.}
