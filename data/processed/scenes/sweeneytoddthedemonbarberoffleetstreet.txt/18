<L>__{exterior exclusive street day}
<A>__{anthony, now out of his sailor's uniform, is walking along the sidewalk near the judge's mansion, absorbed in a copy of baedeker's london. he stops, lost, trying to get his bearings, studying his map. then an unusual sound emerges through the normal cosmopolitan bustle. it is the sound of a woman humming. he looks up to see... johanna, a 16 year old girl with golden hair, beautiful and hauntingly sad. she sits at her window above, behind bars, humming to herself as she does needlepointerior anthony watches her, absolutely mesmerized. johanna notices a bird seller passing. he carries a long, wooden pole with little bird cages attached.}
<C>__{johanna}
<D>__{green finch and linnet bird, nightingale, blackbird, how is it you sing? how can you jubilate, sitting in cages, never taking wing? outside the sky waits, beckoning, beckoning, just beyond the bars. how can you remain, staring at the rain, maddened by the stars? how is it you sing anything? how is it you sing?}
<A>__{then ... she sees anthony on the sidewalk below. music continues. there is a long look between them. her intense, melancholy expression moves him. she continues singing, the strange anguish and yearning of her words seem intended only for him...}
<C>__{johanna}
<D>__{my cage has many rooms, damask and dark. nothing there sings, not even my lark. larks never will, you know, when they're captive. teach me to be more adaptive. green finch and linnet bird, nightingale, blackbird, teach me how to sing. if i cannot fly, let me sing.}
<A>__{then she turns away quickly, alarmed, when someone enters her room. she looks terrified. below, anthony is concerned for her. he sees her move from the window. he is craning to see better when a beggar woman a filthy tendril of a woman, her foul clothes of rags like a second skin suddenly thrusts her arm up from the curb, imploring:}
<C>__{beggar woman}
<D>__{alms! ... alms! ... for a miserable woman on a miserable chilly morning...}
<P>__{(anthony drops a coin into her hand)}
<D>__{thank yer, sir, thank yer.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{ma'am, could tell me whose house this is?}
<C>__{beggar woman}
<D>__{that's the great judge turpin's house that is.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{and the young lady who resides there?}
<C>__{beggar woman}
<D>__{that's johanna, his pretty little ward. keeps her snug, he does, all locked up ... so don't you go trespassing there or it's a good whipping for you or any other young man with mischief on his mind...}
<A>__{she suddenly leers into a lewd and demented assault:}
<C>__{beggar woman}
<D>__{'ow would you like a little muff, dear, a little jig jig a little bounce around the bush? wouldn't you like to push me parsley? it looks to me, dear, like you got plenty there to push.}
<A>__{she grabs at anthony's crotch anthony starts back she turns away, instantly plaintive again, and appeals to other pedestrians as she goes:}
<C>__{beggar woman}
<D>__{alms! ... alms!... for a desperate woman...}
<A>__{anthony considers the mansion. he sees a figure standing at a window, unclear behind the shutters, watching him. he sits on a bench outside the mansion and sings quietly:}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{i feel you, johanna, i feel you. i was half convinced i'd waken, satisfied enough to dream you. happily i was mistaken, johanna! i will steal you, johanna, i will steal you...}
<A>__{then the figure disappears from the window above. anthony stands, waits. then the doors to the mansion swing open... anthony is expecting johanna... but it is judge turpin, the predator we met in todd's flashback, who steps into the doorway. he seems a different man now. paternal and warm, he smiles and beckons to anthony. anthony hesitates, unsure. the judge beckons again. again the warm smile.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{come in, lad. come in...}
<A>__{anthony goes into the mansion.}
