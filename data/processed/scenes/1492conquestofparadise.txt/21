<A>__{the jury is alone to deliberate. food and wine has been laid out on tables. in the distance, students' cries carry over the conversation. sanchez approaches.}

<D>__{the treasurer of spain honors us with his presence.}
<A>__{sanchez bows slightly.}

<D>__{you know, your eminence, the fascinating thing about power, is that what can be given so effortlessly...}

<D>__{... can so easily be taken away.}
<A>__{and he drinks with a smile.}
