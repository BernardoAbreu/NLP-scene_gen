<L>__{exterior central park west late afternoon}
<A>__{dusk falls on the park. charlotte, red cheeked and happy, carrying shopping bags, walks into a brisk autumn breeze. she smiles at a bunch of school kids, dressed in halloween costumes, being led on their trick or treating.}
<L>__{interior elysium rear office afternoon}
<A>__{wills sits at a desk, reading the newspaper. john, inspecting a king henry viii costume on a hanger, shouts into the telephone }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh no, your boy made it! at ten minutes before close! all night i got a card announcing a halibut special, only i got no halibut! now it's sunday and i got three dozen cats lickin' their chops in the alley! tony, i don't wanna hear it! i don't wanna hear it! i don't wanna man, go to hell!}
<A>__{he slams down the phone. his face is beet red. wills looks up calmly from his paper }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{are you familiar with the phrase, "you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar?"}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{are you familiar with the phrase, "mind your own god damn business?"}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{sure, it's from poor richard's almanac. but the last time i checked }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no, your business is to smile, make friends, and get rich! my business is the business.}
<A>__{john heads out, then stops abruptly and looks back. his tone is suddenly calm and curious }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what're you doin' here, anyway? you got a girl. go home. carve a pumpkin.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{we can't spend every waking moment together.}
<A>__{john looks at him strangely, with a hint of suspicion }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{why not?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{no, seriously. why not?}
<A>__{wills has no answer. john moves closer when celia, his new assistant, enters cheerily }
<C>__{celia}
<D>__{special delivery!}
<A>__{she tosses him a paper bag; he catches it.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{no trouble?}
<C>__{celia}
<D>__{none.}
<A>__{wills removes a pair of red plastic horns. john shakes his head with disbelief.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{every year. you got no imagination.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{it's a classic. a little spirit gum and voila!}
<A>__{he holds the horns up to his forehead.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{ young women are rendered helpless.}
<C>__{celia}
<D>__{it's true. i see a guy with horns growing out of his head and my knees go weak.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{of course it's biological.}
<A>__{they share a laugh. a flirtatious charge passes between them. she blushes slightly and exits. john looks suspiciously at wills.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what's goin' on?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{at home.}
<A>__{wills smiles at him as though he were insane }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{nothing. honestly. we're having a lot of fun. we're very happy.}
<A>__{from the next scene, we hear charlotte laughing }
<C>__{charlotte's voice}
