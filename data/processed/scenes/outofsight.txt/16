<L>__{exterior prison yard day}
<A>__{foley and buddy sit atop a cement picnic table watching as nearby, the "winning" boxer still wearing last night's pummelling on his face gloats to a group of cons. he throws a fake punch at one of them as he demonstrates his winning technique...}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{guy's braggin' he won a thrown fight. fuckin' pathetic.}
<A>__{foley looks at the other side of the yard where maurice now stands at the far side of the yard coldly watching the guy, one hand thrust into his pocket. foley watches as maurice stops the new inmate the older guy who looked out of place at the fights as he comes out into the yard.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{it's richard ripley.}
<C>__{buddy}
<P>__{(looking now)}
<D>__{the wall street guy? oh, yeah. i didn't recognize him without his rug.}
<A>__{foley watches as maurice talks to the new inmate, the guy nodding, acquiescent, respectful.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{dick the ripper they called him, on account of all the people he ripped off.}
<A>__{foley watches as ripley now makes a note in a black book.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{what's he doin' here?}
<C>__{glenn }
<D>__{three years.}
<A>__{they look to where glenn michaels, the blond guy in dark shades we saw in maurice's corner, works out on the bench press a few feet away. he's shirtless, tan, in shape.}
<C>__{glenn}
<D>__{he got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check. like that, fifty mil, signed his name.}
<P>__{(struggles with the bar)}
<D>__{whoa little help here!}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{who you talkin' to, studs? me, or buddy. i can't tell, you got those shades on.}
<C>__{glenn}
<D>__{you guys come on this is too heavy!}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.}
<C>__{glenn}
<D>__{i will take the shades off. just get this fuckin' thing off me.}
<A>__{foley helps him get the bar up. glenn sits up.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{how do you know he wrote a check?}
<C>__{glenn}
<D>__{he told me. he works the laundry with me. the guy loves to talk.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{yeah, to the u.s. attorney. i hear he rolled over on all the snitches he was doing business with and got 'em all brought up.}
<A>__{he watches snoopy talking to ripley, one eye always on the swaggering boxer across the yard, one hand in his pocket.}
<C>__{glenn}
<D>__{hey, anybody that can write a check for fifty mil, he says any thing i'm all fucking ears. like the other day, he tells me how he's got all this money in foreign banks, plus around five mil in uncut diamonds at his house. he said, quote, "where i can put my hands on it anytime."}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{cool. where's the guy live?}
<A>__{foley watches a few more of maurice's friends surround ripley. again, ripley takes out his black book, starts nodding, making notations...}
<C>__{glenn}
<D>__{detroit. snoopy miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{ever seen an uncut diamond, studs? they look like plain old rocks.}
<C>__{glenn}
<D>__{so. what's your point?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{my point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.}
<C>__{glenn}
<D>__{you think he's lying?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{use your head. the guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?}
<A>__{a bell sounds. everyone starts walking for the gate. foley watches as the boxer and his crew head for the gate, maurice still standing there with his hand in his pocket. slow motion as the boxer gets to the gate, sees maurice who moves to him now, smiling like he's so glad to see him... his left hand clapping the guy on the back, saying something like congratulations as now his right hand comes out of his pocket and we see the long metal shiv }
<C>__{buddy}
<P>__{(watching snoopy)}
<D>__{here it comes.}
<A>__{maurice wraps his left arm around the boxer's shoulder and hugs him tight for a moment, then quickly moves away. the boxer stands there like a statue, doesn't move until he's at last jostled from behind and his legs fold and he drops to the cement.}
<C>__{buddy }
<D>__{i guess the snoop doesn't like to lose, even if it's on purpose.}
<A>__{we hear a whistle blow as a guard spots the body. and now everyone moves like hell for the gate... except for... richard ripley who stands there frozen, staring down at the body. foley glances back at the approaching guards, casually takes ripley by the arm as he passes, leads him away from there, talks to him as they walk into the block...}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{you don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{oh, uh, right, thanks...}
<A>__{foley then moves away. he sees maurice looking back at him, giving him a hard stare just before he melts into the crowd.}
