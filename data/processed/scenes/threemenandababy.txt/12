<L>__{interior apartment hallway day}
<A>__{peter opens the front door, he stumbles over an object, looks down; at his feet he sees a wicker basket lined with pretty pink and white checked gingham. in the basket a tiny baby lies fast asleep, her head gently resting on a lace pillow. peter looks at this object in amazement. there is an envelope pinned to the basket with the words, "for jack" written on it. peter picks up the letter he opens it and reads.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(to himself)}

<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yeah and he also said 'don't tell anyone about it anyone at all.'}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{oh, so he told you about this?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yeah, he told me a package would be coming today, but he didn't say it'd be this!}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(very angrily)}
<D>__{boy, he's got a helluva nerve!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{just listen to the racket she's making! what are we s'posed to do?}

<C>__{michael}
<D>__{well, just to ask her advice...}

<D>__{but this is an emergency!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{no! no way! you know what a pain that woman is she'll be on the next plane here to move in with us...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{maybe i should call my mother...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{no, please leave the mothers out of this, okay?! it's only four days. we should be able to handle that, besides you know the rule around here: it's fine to have a woman over once in a while, but...}
<A>__{michael finishes the sentence in unison with him.}
<C>__{peter and michael}
<D>__{... never for more than one night at a time!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{and that includes mothers!}
