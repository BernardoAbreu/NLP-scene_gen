<L>__{interior utah's bedroom night}
<A>__{johnny dead asleep. silence. then brrrrr!! he jacknifes up like he just took 20,000 volts. his eyes read panic. he rolls up, legs scissor against tangled sheets and he collapses over empty boxes. he stumbles like a blind man through the mess until he finds a tiny indianapolis colts football helmet with a digital clock for eyes. 5:00 a.m. johnny emits a drawn out groan.}
<L>__{exterior ocean dawn}
<A>__{deafening boom as a monster wave crashes below a sky the color of slate. a distant pacific storm has brought the swell. 10 foot faces. glassy, green walls the size of houses beckoning from beyond the soup. a lone figure bobbing out beyond the break. the surfer disappears behind the swell. then reappears, grinning across the smooth offshore barrel. utah wearing a wetsuit stands beside his surfboard, craning forward to get a better look. the surfer is a woman. she moves with liquid grace, in perfect harmony with the sea, long hair flying out behind her. she undulates like a dancer. dipping, carving, slicing, making it look sooooo easy. johnny shakes his head. oh man, if she can do it...}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{fuck it.}
<A>__{he stands, grabs his board and heads out into the icy foam.}
<B>__{ocean break}
<A>__{a horizon of whitecaps churn behind him. he lies on his board, rising and dropping with the swell. so far so good. he spots a wave. a fluid gray green house rising, forever rising. utah turns. paddles. the house catching him, lifting him high upon its roof. utah is committed. he gets to his feet as his board slices along the lip. he peers over the falls, down the face holy shit! it looks like niagara. he loses balance and spirals airborne, falling bullseye into the impact zone. the entire force of the wave crashing upon him, plunging him down into the washing machine (underwater) where he spins like a whirling dervish, lashed to a slamdancing surfboard at the mercy of god. he is held prisoner in a grey green churning nightmare, like a six ton pit bull has him by the neck, shaking him. he looks around. can't tell up from down. wham! his head slams into the bottom rocks and sand. stunned, he struggles toward the light, finally bursting to the surface. gasping for breath. the good news is he's breathing, the bad news is he's surfaced in the impact zone. another wave crashes down, stuffing him back into the washing machine. leaving no sign of life in the white froth. the orangeade surfboard launches high into the sky, spinning like a misfiring trident missile, trailing its broken leash like a kite tail. in the washing machine, utah tumbles in a cold green hell. his chest is convulsing, needing air now. suddenly a figure lunges down into frame. a hand snatches a fistful of his hair and yanks him toward the surface. the woman surfer bursts through the foam. grabs her board for leverage. hauls utah's head above the water with one strong arm. he is choking, coughing, slapping fatigued arms against the surf, panic registering in his movements.}
<C>__{woman surfer}
<P>__{(yelling above the roar)}
<D>__{swim, goddammit! come on! move it!}
<A>__{the woman gets her board under one of his arms for support and sidekicks fiercely into the wave, holding him in a painful grip. with powerful strokes, she helps utah make it to calmer water outside the break. the big waves, just forming up, lift them and drop them as they pass. muted thunder when the waves hit the beach. she drags him half onto her surfboard. practically slamming his face into the board. he's coughing out saltwater. on the woman, our first good look at her. she is exquisite. hair slicked tight to her high cheekboned face, she looks sleek and feral, with eyes that burn bright. especially when she's pissed.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{look crazy son of a bitch! you wanna commit suicide, you do it someplace else!}
<A>__{she undoes her leash and swims rapidly off, returning in a few seconds with johnny's board. he takes it from her and flops over it, still coughing. wipes at the salt snot running out of his nose. there is a cut over his eye from when he re arranged the rocks on the bottom.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{look at this pig board piece a shit. it's still got the price tag on it, for chrissakes. what'd you do, buy it yesterday? you've got no business out here whatsoever.}
<A>__{still gagging and gasping, johnny manages a goofy grin.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{well, i saw you and }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem. right?! well you figured wrong, dork!}
<A>__{she yanks her board around and strokes powerfully away from him.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{hey! uh, how do i get back in?}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(without turning)}
<D>__{carefully, tough guy. very carefully.}
<C>__{utah}
<P>__{(yelling now)}
<D>__{my name's johnny utah!}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{who cares!}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{i'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and i let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when i could have easily helped him.}
<A>__{johnny calmly starts paddling toward shore. thundering white water pounding the rocks ahead of him. he's stoic in the face of certain death.}
<C>__{utah}
<P>__{(over his shoulder, gamely)}
<D>__{bye.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{wait! jesus christ!}
<P>__{(swimming back to him)}
<D>__{you're fucking crazy, you know that? you go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks. here, follow me.}
<A>__{the woman paddles parallel to the shore and utah pumps along behind her. she gets him away from the rocks, then starts watching the incoming swell, timing it to the lull between sets...}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{go when i say. but stay down. just lie on the board. alright, let's go!}
<A>__{utah paddles rapidly, following her, watching what she does. he is borne up by a low glassy wall. he bellyboards all the way into the mushy shorebreak. tumbles. stands unsteadily, grabbing his board. runs clumsily out of the retreating foam as another wave comes, sucking water out. on terra firma he looks back to see the woman kick out gracefully and disappear beyond the wave. he flops on the sand. shivering. miserable.}
