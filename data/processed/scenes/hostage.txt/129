<A>__{thomas is climbing onto the washing machine when his foot slips and he bangs his head it's so dark in ehre that thomas can't see what made him slip, but he tests the floor. his shoe makes a tacky sound. thomas cups his hand over his flashlight like before, and turns it on. a dark liquid like oil is spreading on the floor. thomas follows it with his light to the broom closet. he lets out more light and sees that the oil is red. thomas knows that something terrible is behind the door, but he is drawn to it. he reaches out kevin's lifeless body topples out, collapsing in a heap at thomas's feet. his neck is cut so deeply that his head is almost severed his eyes are open. thomas screams!}
