<T>__{fade out: fade in:}
<A>__{town square day a knot of villagers lead tyrian and his henchmen across the square directly to the blacksmith's shop. the king's men dismount and pound on the door. it swings open. valerian is standing there.}
<C>__{tyrian}
<D>__{where is he?}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{not here. i can't help you.}
<A>__{a cry goes up from the villagers. they know damn well he's in there. valerian's house tyrian pushes valerian aside and steps into the room. aided by some townfolk, his men proceed to ransack the premises, overturning barrels, sticking their swords through flour sacks, poking through the tumbledown thatch. valerian's eye falls on malkin, who has involved himself in the search.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{you too?}
<C>__{malkin}
<P>__{(returning her look)}
<D>__{damn right.}
<A>__{finding nothing, the group pushes into the metal shop, where simon is hammering an iron wheel rim back into shape on an enormous anvil. he lays down his tools and grimly watches the men go through, overturning benches and tables. tyrian props a leg up on the anvil and addresses himself to simon.}
<C>__{tyrian}
<D>__{as the proud new father of an eligible daughter who was some how overlooked all these years, it may interest you to know that the king has called for a new lottery.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{but it's months til the solstice.}
<C>__{tyrian}
<D>__{in view of what's happened, we all know what's required.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i've never taken part in your cursed lottery, and i will have nothing to do with it now.}
<C>__{tyrian}
<D>__{you were very clever. but she'll take part, like all the rest. no exceptions.}
<A>__{the search party has exhausted the room's hiding places.}
<C>__{henchman}
<D>__{nothing. if he was here, he's gone now.}
<A>__{tyrian nods and leads the way out. simon catches up and pulls tyrian aside at the door.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{all right. i know what you want. how much?}
<C>__{tyrian}
<D>__{are you offering me a bribe?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{tyrian}
<D>__{don't waste your time.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you could never afford it.}
<A>__{he spins on his heel and joins his men as they ride out of town. valerian and simon watch them go. when the riders are out of sight, they return to the shop. with a couple of stout poles, they strain to lift the anvil off its base. finally it topples over. valerian slides the base aside, revealing a trap door. she raises it and a cramped galen unfolds himself from the space below. on his face is a curious look of determination.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{smith have you ever forged a weapon?}
<B>__{weapons}
<A>__{simon is going through a cabinet, tossing out hoes, rakes, sickles, scythes, plow blades, and a knife or two. galen examines them doubtfully. now simon produces an armload of swords. galen is impressed; he looks them over carefully, testing and rejecting them in turn.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{these are your sharpest?}
<A>__{simon plucks up one of the swords, carries it to the center of the room. he lays a horseshoe on the anvil. he brings the sword down whack! and cuts the horseshoe in half.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{even tyrian carries one of these.}
<A>__{galen hefts it dubiously.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{it's sharp but it's not sharp enough.}
<A>__{valerian has been watching all this with growing concern.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{not sharp enough for what?}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{for what i'm going to do with it.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{nothing's that sharp.}
<A>__{simon gnaws his lip. reluctantly, he brings a long box from the bottom of the cabinet. he opens it. lying on a bed of silk is an exquisite two handed broadsword. the flat blade gleams like a mirror. galen reaches in and lifts it out.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{the best i ever made.}
<A>__{valerian is as awed as galen.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{it's beautiful.}
<A>__{galen brings up a finger to test the edge. simon grabs his hand away.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{don't do that!}
<P>__{(he looks at valerian)}
<D>__{girl child, when you were born i knew i had to do something, so i set about the task of fashioning an extraordinary weapon: i had the skill to make it }
<P>__{(bleak pause)}
<D>__{ but not the nerve to use it.}
<A>__{she looks at him with affection. leaning forward, she plants a kiss on his bald pate.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{i'm thankful for that.}
<P>__{(to galen)}
<D>__{no man should choose a senseless death.}
