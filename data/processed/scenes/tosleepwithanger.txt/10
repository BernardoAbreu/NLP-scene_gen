<B>__{close up of birds flying}
<A>__{as the birds circle skip's house, they do backward rolls and death grips. skip throws more rocks to keep them flying. the rocks land on gideon's roof. the sound of a person trying to learn how to play a trumpet breaks the pleasant sounds of the pigeons popping their wings and flying in circles over the house.}
