<A>__{light.}
<L>__{interior city}
<A>__{we enter with indy and the others. the city is bursting with the bright colors of various vegetable and fruit gardens, and various other exotic plant life. luscious green grass and crystal clear lakes surround many of the homes. the earthen streets are literally paved with gold. the men and women of the city are members of tyki's race. oriental pygmies. there is a peaceful, joyous quality about them. they rush toward tyki. embracing him. showering him with kisses. welcoming him home. indiana and the others are in awe of this new world. gutterbuhg walks with them. camera pans to his hands. he struggles to untie his bindings. kezure spots something. a small, solid gold garden tool. lying in a vegetable garden. kezure's eyes fill with greed. he moves to steal the can. kezure grabs the tool and begins to hide it. beneath his cloak. a large gorilla's hand grabs kezure's arm. towering over the pirate king, the gorilla waves his finger at kezure. a warning. no stealing. the nervous kezure nods. he places the garden tool back on the ground. meanwhile, indy and the others are led to an elaborate palace. they ascend the several golden stairs, toward the entrance. the palace doors open. an older man steps outside. he is bohbala. the city's ruler. a few palace guards stand beside him. bohbala raises his arms over the crowd. pygmies and gorillas drop to their knees. in revernce. tyki runs to bohbala. they embrace. tears of joy fill their eyes. bohbala wipes away his tears. he gives a warm smile to indiana and the others. he speaks. softly. in a wise voice. scraggy translates for the others.}

<D>__{he thank us...for returning his son.}
<A>__{indiana and the others smile. betsy whipsers to indy.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{if the little guy's pushin' 200 years?... how old's his father?}
<A>__{indy motions for betsy to "shhh". bohbala continues to speak. scraggy}

<C>__{scraggy}
<D>__{his name "bohbala". he is ruler of city, faithful servant of his lord and master... sun wu kung.}
<P>__{(pause, smile)}
<D>__{he welcome us to stay. as long as we wish.}
<A>__{indiana exchanges a hopeful glance with clare. as bohbala continues to speak, camera pans to gutterbuhg. the nazi has successfully untied his bindings. free. while the others listen to bohbala, gutterbuhg removes one spare bullet from his mouth. he slyly inserts the bullet into his mechanical arm. indiana is too concerned with bohbala to notice gutterbuhg.}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(anxious, to scraggy)}
<D>__{ask him where we may find the burial place...or the remains...of sun wu kung...}
<A>__{scraggy turns to ask bohbala. but his question is interrupted by gutterbuhg's mechanical arm. it extends into frame! its finger pointed at indiana! everyone stares. shocked. but the bizarre sight greatly amuses bohbala. he begins to laugh. he reaches out and pushes gutterbuhg's finger away. but the machine gun goes off! firing! bohbala is hit! in the chest. he falls. tyki kneels, cradling bohbala's head in his arms. tyki calls his father's name. it is futile. bohbala is dead. the crowd of villagers stare. confused. they are unaccustomed to}

<A>__{indiana clutches gutterbuhg by the throat.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{bastard...}
<A>__{indiana pulls back his fist to punch the nazi. but indy is stopped by the palace guards. they move their swords to his throat. indy is suddenly puzzled. the villagers fall to their knees. bowing to gutterbuhg. a distraught tyki hurriedly explains to scraggy, who translates for indy.}
<C>__{scraggy}
<D>__{it is written... if ruler is defeated by greater power...he who possess that power...}
<P>__{(points to gutterbuhg)}
<D>__{...shall become ruler!}
<A>__{gutterbuhg's eyes fill with a sadistic thrill. he raises his mechanical arm. in a "heil hitler" pose. the entire city imitates the nazi. raising their right arms. cheering. hailing their new leader. indiana is horrified by the scene. tyki is upset. screaming. he knows that gutterbuhg is truly evil! but none of the villagers listen. indiana looks to his shocked friends.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{this is turning into one helluva nightmare.}
<C>__{gutterbubg}
<P>__{(hears, smiles at indy)}
<D>__{one you will never awaken from, doctor jones.}
