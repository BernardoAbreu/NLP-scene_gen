<L>__{exterior jade palace grounds evening}
<A>__{oogway stands under the peach tree, deep in thought. shifu rushes in, emerging from the mist, extremely agitated.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{master! master!}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{hmmm?}
<C>__{shifu}
<P>__{(out of breath)}
<D>__{i have it's it's very bad news.}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{ah, shifu. there is just news. there is no good or bad.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{master, your vision...your vision was right. tai lung has broken out of prison. he's on his way!}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{that is bad news...}
<A>__{he turns to face shifu and stares at him, eyebrow raised.}
<C>__{oogway }
<D>__{...if you do not believe that the dragon warrior can stop him.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{the panda? master, that panda is not the dragon warrior.}
<C>__{shifu }
<D>__{he wasn't even meant to be here it was an accident!}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{there are no accidents.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{yes, i know. you've said that already. twice.}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{well, that was no accident either.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{thrice.}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{my old friend, the panda will never fulfill his destiny, nor you yours, until you let go of the illusion of control.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{illusion?}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{yeah. look at this tree, shifu. i cannot make it blossom when it suits me, nor make it bear fruit before its time.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{but there are things we can control.}
<A>__{shifu kicks the tree and a peach falls to his feet.}
<C>__{shifu }
<D>__{i can control when the fruit will fall.}
<A>__{a peach falls on his head and oogway chuckles. shifu tosses the peach in the air, leaps up, and splits it with a chop.}
<C>__{shifu }
<D>__{and i can control }
<A>__{shifu punches the ground, creating a hole and places the seed in it.}
<C>__{shifu }
<D>__{ where to plant the seed. that is no illusion, master.}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{ah, yes. but no matter what you do, that seed will grow to be a peach tree. you may wish for an apple, or an orange... but you will get a peach.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{but a peach cannot defeat tai lung!}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{maybe it can. if you are willing to guide it, to nurture it. to believe in it.}
<A>__{oogway covers the seed with dirt.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{but how? how? i need your help, master.}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{no, you just need to believe. promise me, shifu. promise me you will believe.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{i... i will try.}
<A>__{oogway smiles, then glances up at the sky, then back down to shifu.}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{good. my time has come. you must continue your journey without me.}
<A>__{he hands his staff to a confused shifu.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{what... what are you..?}
<A>__{oogway backs away into the swirling fog.}
<C>__{shifu }
<D>__{master, you can't leave me!}
<A>__{the petals surround oogway as he approaches the cliff's edge.}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{you must believe.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{master!}
<A>__{shifu runs after him. oogway is engulfed by peach blossoms. as the winds settle, shifu is revealed standing at the edge of a cliff. oogway is gone. we pan across to the bunkhouse.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{...so i'm like, fine, you may be a wolf, you may be the scariest bandit in haijin province...}
