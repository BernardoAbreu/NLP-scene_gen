<L>__{interior captain's office day}
<A>__{holmes is seated at his desk as prewitt and warden enter. a placard on it reads: captain holmes. a smaller desk nearby has a placard' reading: 1st sergeant warden. warden seats himself at this desk. on the walls are framed photographs of prizefighters as well as one of a large golden trophy. on holmes' desk is a small framed photograph of a very attractive blonde woman. prewitt comes to attention in front of holmes' desk.}
<C>__{prewitt}
<D>__{sir, private robert e. lee prewitt reporting to the compny commander as ordered.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{at ease.}
<P>__{(takes papers out of}
<D>__{drawer, glances through}
<P>__{them)}
<D>__{they sent your service record over... twenty two years of age... born in kentucky... enlisted first at fort myer, virginia... bugle corps... re enlisted for overseas duty... fort shafter... first bugler...}
<P>__{(benignly)}
<D>__{prewitt, i always make it a policy to talk to my new men. it's important for an officer and his men to understand each other. now i have a fine smooth running outfit.}
<B>__{angle featuring warden}
<A>__{holmes cannot see warden who is grinning at prewitt with unholy glee.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{plenty of room for advancement for a man who knows how to soldier. but he's got to show me he's got it on the ball. i don't know what you've been used to in the bugle corps, but in my outfit we run it by the book. what kind of trouble were you in over there?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{no trouble, sir.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{what made you transfer out, then?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{it's a personal matter, air.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{oh. i see...}
<A>__{he studies prew for a moment, sees warden on the edge of his chair, watching hawk like.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{something you wanted to ask, sergeant?}
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(explodes suddenly)}
<D>__{who? me? whv, yes, air. you had corpral's stripes in the bugle corps, prewitt. you took a bust to buck private to transfer to an infantry compny. why? because you like to hike?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{i dint have no trouble if that's what you mean.}
<C>__{warded}
<P>__{(grins suddenly)}
<D>__{or was it just because you couldn't stand to bugle?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{it was a personal matter.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{that's up to the compny commander's discretion to decide.}
<C>__{prew}
<P>__{(looks straight at warden)}
<D>__{all right. i was first bugler at shafter for two years. the topkick had a friend who transferred in from the states. next day he made him first bugler over me.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{and you asked out on account of that!?}
<C>__{prey}
<D>__{maybe i just ain't sensible... but that's the reason.}
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(snorts)}
<D>__{his feelings were hurt! kids they send us now!}
<A>__{warden swings his chair around, absorbs himself in work at his desk as if the prew situation is too absurd to concern himself with. holmes speaks blandly, winningly.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i've got a mighty sour company bugler here... but i suppose you wouldn't want that job.}
<C>__{prey}
<D>__{no, air.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{well, we'll get your stripes back for you, maybe an extra one for good measure. you know why you were sent over here when you requested transfer?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{holds}
<D>__{i pulled a few strings. i'm the regimental boxing coach, prewitt. i saw your fight with connors in the bowl year before last. with any luck you should have won it. i thought for a while, in the second round, you were going to knock him out.}
<C>__{prew}
<P>__{(tense)}
<D>__{thank you, sir.}
<B>__{medium close shot holmes}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{my regiment got beaten last year in the finals, as you know.}
<P>__{(savage insistence)}
<D>__{but i mean to win this year. and i will. all i've needed was a top middleweight.}
<P>__{(waves at pictures)}
<D>__{next year i will hang your picture up there with the others, my boy.}
<B>__{medium shot featuring prew}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{i'm sorry, air. but i quit fighting.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{quit fighting? when? what for?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{i just stopped, sir... after maybe you heard about what happened...}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you mean that fallow you hurt the one that went blind?}
<B>__{close shot prew}
<A>__{prew's lips are drawn tight. he nods almost imperceptibly.}
<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{during this shot maggio can be seen in b.g. through door to orderly room. he pretends to be sweeping, but stops now and then to listen.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{yes, it's too bad about that. i can understand how you feel. but those things happen in this game. a man has got to accept that possibility when he fights.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{that's why i decided i would quit, sir.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(less warmly)}
<D>__{but on the other hand, look at}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it this way. what if all fighters felt like that?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{they don't.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{would you have us disband our fighting program because one man got hurt?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{no, sir. i dint say }
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you might as well say stop war because one man got killed. our fighting program is the best morale builder we have off here away from home.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{i don't want it disbanded, sir.}
<P>__{(doggedly)}
<D>__{but i don't see why any man should fight unless he wants to.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it looks to me like you're trying to acquire a reputation as a lone wolf, prewitt. you should know that in the army it's not the individual that counts. if a man wants to get ahead he has certain responsibilities to fulfill that go beyond the regulations. it might look as though i were a free agent, but i'm not. nobody is.}
<A>__{holmes waits hopefully for a moment, then realizes prew is not going to respond further. he stands. prew snaps to attention.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{maybe you'll change your mind. in the meantime just don't make any mistakes in my outfit.}
<P>__{(to warden)}
<D>__{i've got to go into town. is there anything else for me today, sergeant?}
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(holds up papers)}
<D>__{yea, sir! the compny pond report's got to be made out. it's due tomorrow }
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you make it out. is that all?}
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(holds up more papers)}
<D>__{no, sir!}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{well, whatever it is, you fix it. if there's anything that has to go in this afternoon, sign my name. i won't be back.}
<A>__{he goes out, crossing warden's desk and knocking a wire basket filled with papers on the floor. in a moment, the sound of the screen door slamming is heard. warden picks up the papers.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{he'd strangle on his own spit if i weren't here to swab out his throat for him.}
<P>__{(to prew)}
<D>__{come on. i will show you the supply room.}
<A>__{warden goes out to orderly room, prew following.}
