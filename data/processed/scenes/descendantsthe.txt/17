<L>__{interior king house day}
<A>__{as matt speaks on the phone, he wanders out of his cluttered home office and into the dining room.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{how can i help you?}
<C>__{barb higgins }
<D>__{let's see, where to start? it's scottie. she's been texting some awful things to lani, and i'd like her to stop.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{for instance.}
<C>__{barb higgins }
<D>__{here's the latest one. "we all know you grew pubes over the summer." she sends little messages like that for no reason. she even wrote it on lani's facebook wall.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{huh.}
<C>__{barb higgins }
<D>__{she calls my daughter lanikai, implying she's like the size of an entire neighborhood. do you think that's nice?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{that's not like her at all. she's usually very sweet.}
<A>__{he glances out the window at scottie, who sits on the ground, back turned, pounding something with a big rock.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{as you may know, her mother isn't well, and maybe this is how she's dealing with it.}
<C>__{barb higgins }
<D>__{i don't care about the backstory, mr. king. my daughter comes home from school in tears.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yeah, no, i get it. i'm very sorry.}
<C>__{barb higgins }
<D>__{scottie should be the one who's sorry. i want her to come over and apologize to lani, and i don't ever want her to write to my daughter again.}
<C>__{lani }
<D>__{she can in a good way.}
<C>__{barb higgins }
<D>__{if she doesn't apologize, i'm going to tell the headmaster. you can't buy your way out of this.}
<A>__{matt draws a long exasperated breath, as if everything else weren't enough already.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{see what i mean? everybody sees me as the rich guy, the inheritor. people resent us. i resent us. even our last name king. how irritating.}
