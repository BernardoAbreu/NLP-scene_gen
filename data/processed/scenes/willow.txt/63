<L>__{exterior nockmaar campsite night}
<A>__{fires and torches burn around pitched tents. soldiers eat and drink, and meat is thrown out to death dogs. from her cage, raziel looks down at willow, still chained to the wagon next to madmartigan. willow is grinding a substance with a rock.}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{keep working at it. forget all you know, or think you know. a magician's power depends on disord er of the mind.}
<A>__{she twists her head through the bars. madmartigan squints up at her.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{you got that one covered.}
<A>__{willow hears the baby crying in a distant tent.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i hope she's all right. how much more do i have to do of this?}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{till it's in a powder. the energy exits within you...}
<C>__{willow}
<P>__{(reciting)}
<D>__{i know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self. but what's this got to do with it?}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{as below, so above. you hold the univers, willow, in your hand.}
<A>__{madmartigan clasps his forhead.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{i'm beginning to think you two deserve to be locked up.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{the universe is a living creature, like you and me, madmartigan.}
<A>__{madmartigan cynically gazes at the sky, gesturing wide ly.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{we're a tiny version of all that?}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{as above, so below.}
<A>__{madmartigan rolls his eyes. willow jumps to his feet and shows raziel the substance.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i'm all finished. now what?}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{burn it to a fine ash.}
<A>__{willow looks around. heavily armed nockmaar minions rip chunks of meat around a campfire.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{how am i gonna do that?}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{patience. concentrate. you will find a way.}
<A>__{suddenly bootsteps clomp toward them. willow quickly folds the powder inside some cloth and hides it in his pocket. the lieutenant marches up and scrutinizes them suspiciously. he abruptly snatches willow up, hacks the chain and drags him off.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<A>__{madmartigan sturggles against his chains. angry and worried:}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{hurt him and you'll answer to me!}
