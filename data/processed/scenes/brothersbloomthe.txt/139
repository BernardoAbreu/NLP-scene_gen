<L>__{exterior castle adjacent streets continuous}
<A>__{stephen, bloom and penelope are joined by the chink.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{he looks through his binoculars again.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{alright?}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{they share a brief moment with their eyes, and penelope trots off. the chink caught it. she looks at bloom slyly.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{for the record, i'm still against this. why send her in alone?}
<A>__{the chink finds a way to casually smell bloom's fingers.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{because going in alone is a very important thing to do. she's walking into a zero security tourism office during a fire drill and taking a five hundred dollar manuscript replica from a utility crawlspace. worst case scenario, a file clerk asks if she's lost. which isn't even going to happen.}
<P>__{(to the chink)}
<D>__{she's in position.}
<A>__{he spots penelope casually waiting beside an unmarked door. bloom notices the chink looking at him with a knowing grin. she mimes sealing her lips and tossing the key. she then takes the ballpoint pen detonator... out of the handbag dangling at her hip.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{cause nobody's going to know we were ever here.}
<A>__{bloom spots the handbag. something's not right.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{uh }
<A>__{the chink clicks the pen.}
