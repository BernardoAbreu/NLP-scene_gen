<A>__{tight on monitor showing jake's avatar face on the dozer camera, as he pounds a rock into the lens. the shot freezes on jake's animal snarl. wider human jake sits, bruised and bleeding, watching himself on the monitor. grace and norm stand nearby, rubbing their wrists where the zip ties bit in. selfridge and quaritch watch with disdain.}
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{you let me down, son. you got a little local pussy and completely forgot what team you play for.}
<A>__{jake meets his gaze with a defiant glare.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{parker, listen, there may still be time to }
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{shut your fucking hole!}
<A>__{grace is momentarily stunned by quaritch's fury. but she meets it with her own intensity, not backing down an inch.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{or what, ranger rick? you gonna shoot me?}
<P>__{(to selfridge)}
<D>__{you need to muzzle your dog!}
<C>__{selfridge}
<D>__{can we just take this down a couple notches, please.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(to quaritch)}
<D>__{you say you want to keep your people alive. start by listening to her.}
<A>__{jake nods to grace to continue.}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(to selfridge)}
<D>__{this is bad, parker. those trees were sacred to the omaticaya in a way you can't imagine.}
<C>__{selfridge}
<D>__{you know what? you throw a stick in the air around here it falls on some sacred fern.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i'm not talking about pagan voodoo here i'm talking about something real and measurable in the biology of the forest.}
<C>__{selfridge}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{which is what exactly?}
<A>__{grace's nerve fails. a rush of conflicting emotions the need to act, to do something, colliding with her scientific rigor.}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(to jake)}
<D>__{i can't do this. how am i supposed to reduce years of work to a sound bite for the illiterate?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{just tell him what you know in your heart.}
<A>__{she turns to parker, steeling herself.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{alright, look i don't have the answers yet, i'm just now starting to even frame the questions. what we think we know is that there's some kind of electrochemical communication between the roots of the trees. like the synapses between neurons. each tree has ten to the fourth connections to the trees around it, and there are ten to the twelfth trees on pandora }
<C>__{selfridge}
<D>__{that's a lot i'm guessing.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{that's more connections than the human brain. you get it? it's a network a global network. and the na'vi can access it they can upload and download data memories at sites like the one you destroyed.}
<C>__{selfridge}
<D>__{what the hell have you people been smoking out there? they're just. goddamn. trees.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you need to wake up, parker. the wealth of this world isn't in the ground it's all around us. the na'vi know that, and they're fighting to defend it. if you want to share this world with them, you need to understand them.}
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{we understand them just fine. thanks to jake here.}
<A>__{jake shares a look of alarm with grace as quaritch selects a new clip on the main monitor tight on monitor video log image of jake, looking haggard and borderline deranged, rambling in a late night monologue.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{they're not going to give up their home they're not gonna make a deal. for what? lite beer and shopping channel? there's nothing we have that they want. we're a horror to them. we're the monsters from space.}
<A>__{jake watches with a growing dread as his words condemn the people he has grown to love.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{they're never going to leave hometree.}
<A>__{quaritch freezes the recording.}
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{since a deal can't be made it gets real simple.}
<P>__{(to jake, icily)}
<D>__{so thanks. i'm getting all emotional. i might just give you a big wet kiss.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{parker, we have to talk, like rational people.}
<C>__{selfridge}
<D>__{well, i'd cherish that, but unfortunately you're out of here on the next shuttle. all of you. i'm shutting down the avatar program, effective now.}
<A>__{on jake, grace and norm, speechless.}
