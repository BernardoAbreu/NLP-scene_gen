<L>__{interior multi storied auto park san antonio day}
<A>__{the station wagon enters the building. doc takes a bright orange ticket from an attendant behind a glass window, then accelerates the wagon up a rampway leading to the upper levels of the building.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{checks his watch momentarily as he prowls the wagon between long rows of automobiles.}
<A>__{the station wagon's tires whine through a sweeping turn within the auto park's uppermost level through the building's portals the bright morning sun can be seen reflecting off the city's rooftops. doc pulls the wagon to an abrupt halt within a parking stall at an isolated area. he steps out onto the concrete flooring, slams the door shut. doc turns away from the car. as he approaches the elevator, doc tears the orange auto park stub into fragments and drops them into a trash bin without missing a stride.}
