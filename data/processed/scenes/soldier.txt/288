<A>__{muzzle flash! fffwhooomp! crawler two fires another round. the vehicle is squatting not thirty yards from the trench garden, pouring round after round into the colony, lighting the night with bright colored flowery blasts. crouched in the wind not far from the vehicle, the two new soldiers from the back seat have set up a mortar, and they too are firing away.}

<A>__{the gunner is looking through his scope, methodically aiming and firing as caine 607 at the wheel watches impassively. ka foomp! another shot, the vehicle rocks, and, five hundred yards away, fire and dirt fountain thirty feet into the air. beep! beep! a light on the dash blinks on. caine 607 switches on a radarscope, spots a blip. the gunner takes his eyes off the scope, looks at the blip. caine 607 is already manipulating a spotlight, looking across the gunner out the right window. the spotlight stabs the darkness, finds a moving vehicle a half mile of moving toward them. it's crawler one with its lights out. as caine 607 flicks off the spotlight, the gunner turns back to the scope and resumes his deadly barrage. caine 607 speaks into the radio mike.}
