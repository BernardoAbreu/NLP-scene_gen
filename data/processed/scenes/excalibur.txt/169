<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{what's behind that beauty? a wizened, cold hearted snake.}
<A>__{merlin steps back, grandiose and melodramatic.}

<D>__{you are a snake about to strike!}
<A>__{he raises his staff.}
<C>__{merlin}

<A>__{he lowers the staff with dreamlike slowness and she slinks right up to him.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{burning with the fire of desire, i am the flames that consume the staff to ashes.}
<A>__{she winds her fluttering hands around the staff, and the shadows they cast upon the tent give the illusion of licking flames.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{i am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{i am the desert, where water disappears }
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{ i am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{ i am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...}
<A>__{she laughs at her cleverness.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{fog and mist! you couldn't be that. you don't have enough magic.}
