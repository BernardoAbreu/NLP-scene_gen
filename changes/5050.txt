<ACTION>__{Adam enters the Hospital. The mood is calm. All the chaos one would expect to find in a hospital of this size is tucked away behind the sterile and monochrome walls. Adam walks to the reception counter. The RECEPTIONIST is engrossed with the latest edition of US Weekly. She ignores Adam who just stands there awkwardly, unsure of what to do. Adam gives out a small cough to grab her attention. The Receptionist keeps her eyes fixed on her magazine.}

<ACTION>__{The interior of Adam's house is spotless. Pictures on the walls: Adam and his dad sailing. Adam and his parents at his Bar Mitzvah. Adam and his best friend, Seth, at High School Graduation. A University of Berkeley hat. A National Academic Achievement Award in the Sciences. Curled in a fetal position, Adam sleeps peacefully next to RACHEL (25), his loving girlfriend. Cute, charming, and artsy, Rachel is "Winnie Cooper" all grown up. The sound of the waves crashing stops abruptly. A loud obnoxious alarm clock goes off. Startled, Adam jumps up. Drenched in sweat, and completely disoriented, he looks around in confusion. After a moment, Adam pulls an earplug out of each ear, and turns off the alarm. The sound of the crashing waves turns back on. Adam pushes a button on the alarm clock and the sound of the waves stops, but the loud obnoxious alarm returns. He pushes the clock again. The alarm turns off but now we hear the sound of crickets chirping. Again Adam pushes a button, this time we hear the sound of a loud thunder/rain storm, he pushes a button again, this time we hear the sound of loud clanging church bells. Rachel rolls over -}

<LOC>__{INT. BEDROOM CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER}

<ACTION>__{SETH (25), pulls up in front of Adam's house in his white Neon and HONKS the horn. On the bumper is a sticker: "Let's put the Christ back in Christmas." Overweight, well dressed, and wearing an air of confidence, Seth pulls out a massive joint, lights it and takes a hit. Just then Seth looks over at 3 YOUNG SCHOOL CHILDREN and their MOTHER waiting for the school bus. The mother's jaw is on the ground in shock. Seth hides the joint and smiles in embarrassment.}
