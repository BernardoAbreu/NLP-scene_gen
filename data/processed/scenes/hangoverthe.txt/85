<L>__{interior chaps dressing room}
<A>__{the dressing room is packed with muscular, tan, buck naked men, walking around, rubbing baby oil on themselves, donning chaps and codpieces, getting ready for the next show. chastity and the guys move through the mob of beefcake, staying ridiculously close together. vick stops at one dancer, trying not to look down at his junk:}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{excuse me, friend, can you tell me where roger is?}
<C>__{beefcake cowboy}
<D>__{oh, hey, vick! roger's over there.}
<A>__{he points to a really hot, really naked guy with a funky mullet, stretching out in front of his mirror. the guys shuffle over to him. vick tries to be supportive with stu:}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{he's cute...i guess...?}
<A>__{stu shrugs, yeah, i guess...? as they draw close, roger sees them, and smiles.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{oh! hey guys!}
<A>__{he hugs all of them. the guys make sure to keep their asses arched back to avoid genital contact.}
<C>__{roger }
<D>__{i'm surprised you're even walking yet, stu.}
<C>__{stu}
<P>__{(inhaling sharply)}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{listen, man, we don't really remember what happened last night, can you fill us in?}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{really? no memory?}
<A>__{stu shakes his head, wide eyed, scared...}
<C>__{roger }
<D>__{well, i must say, stu, i'm a little hurt.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{did we...you know...do anything?}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{well, duh? yeah?}
<A>__{the guys all freeze. a beat. then vick pats stu's shoulder, supportive.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{was i...the boy or the girl?}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{oh, honey, you were everything.}
<A>__{stu whimpers. vick and alan exchange a look, holy shit!}
<C>__{roger }
<D>__{but you were nothing like vick.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{wait what?!}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{i know, i'm sort of over group stuff too, but alan insisted.}
<A>__{now it's alan's turn to look stunned.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{you insisted?! why'd you insist?!}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{i don't know! i don't know why i insisted!}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{actually, after the anger went away, it was really quite tender.}
<A>__{the guys look at each other, nauseous.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i'm really not sure we can be friends anymore...}
<A>__{finally, chastity starts laughing.}
<C>__{chastity}
<D>__{guys: he's kidding.}
<A>__{roger breaks into a smile and slaps five with chastity. the guys all exhale, incredibly relieved.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{not cool, roger. not cool.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{so what did happen last night?}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{oh, well, you guys came in near the end of our last set, like 2ish. doug pretty much dragged you in.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{really? doug did?}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{oh no, my doug, not your doug. black guy, shaved head?}
<A>__{the guys look at each other, confused.}
<C>__{roger }
<D>__{he's a cake designer, he said he met you guys at some sort of birthday party at the rio?}
<C>__{vick}
<P>__{(snapping his finger)}
<D>__{the guy from the jimmy lang surveillance video.}
<A>__{the guys nod, right.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{anyway, for the big finale of our show, we always bring someone on stage, and, well, stu, you volunteered pretty aggressively.}
<P>__{(to nearby dancer)}
<D>__{hey dallas, do we have the video of last night's show?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{no! that's cool, i don't need to see it }
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{we must see that video.}
<C>__{dallas}
<D>__{it's in the machine.}
<A>__{roger nods and presses play on a little vcr tv combo sitting in front of his mirror. on the tv a very brokeback, chippendale's style male revue starts playing. stu gasps. roger fast forwards.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{you were pretty mellow at first, stu, but once we got you into the chaps, you really came alive oh, here it is.}
<A>__{on the tv we see stu, wearing only his "i roger" g string and assless chaps, grinding on stage with the golden pony dancers. he is way fatter, paler, and hairier than the greased young studs. the guys look away, oooo.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i'm a dad, i i don't get to the gym as much as i'd like...}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{you even taught us the pony, which we'd never even heard of before...}
<A>__{on the tv stu gets on all fours on the stage, and eagerly gestures for the dancers to take turns "riding" him. stu's face drops.}
<C>__{roger }
<D>__{and then, of course, the piece de resistance: the ride of the valkyries.}
<A>__{on the video stu clutches onto roger from behind as they ride a lavender mechanical bull together. the crowd goes wild.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{annnnd that would explain the searing ass pain.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{after the show, we split a couple pitchers of flirtinis, you had our stylist cut your hair like mine, and then you split.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{and what time was all this?}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{4:30 in the morning? 4:45?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{and our doug was with us?}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{yeah, he had passed out by then, but you carried him out. it was all very officer and a gentleman.}
<A>__{the guys look at each other, confused.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{wait, so we left with doug at 4:45, we got back to the hotel at 5:00, and doug was gone by 5:30 when chastity met back up with us?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{that doesn't make any sense.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{did we lose him along the way?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{he was passed out, how far could he have gone ?}
<A>__{just then, vick's cellphone rings. the caller id reads "mandalay bay." he answers:}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{hello?}
