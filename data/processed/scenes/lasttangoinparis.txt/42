<L>__{interior hotel marcels room evening}
<A>__{marcel is in his red plaid bathrobe. he sits at his desk, clipping coupons from a newspaper. [oc] knock on door}
<B>__{dialogue is french}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{come in!}
<A>__{paul comes in. he is in a matching red plaid bathrobe.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you wanted to talk to me. go on, then. you know i haven't come to cry with you?}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{do you mind if i carry on working?}
<A>__{he does while paul roots around.}
<C>__{marcel }
<D>__{it helps me a lot after what has happened.}
<A>__{he takes notice of paul's robe.}
<C>__{marcel }
<D>__{identical. rosa wanted them identical.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{our bathrobes? you can't tell me anything i don't already know.}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{same colour, same pattern.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes, yes, yes.}
<A>__{paul takes a look at one of the newspapers from marcel's desk.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{your meticulous. i've always wondered why you save newspaper clippings. is it work? or a hobby?}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{hobby? i don't like that word. let's say it's some extra cash. i do it for an agency.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{oh, so it's serious. it's a job that makes you read? very educational.}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{be honest. you didn't know we had the same bathrobes.}
<A>__{paul finds this very amusing.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{marcello...}
<A>__{he sits on marcels bed.}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{we've got a lot of things in common.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{marcello, i know everything.}
<A>__{he flicks the light on and off as he talks.}
<D>__{no, rosa often talked to me about you. i don't think there are many marriages like that. it's strange... i'm thirsty.}
<A>__{he heads to the door.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{would you like a shot of bourbon?}
<A>__{marcel stops him.}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{hold on. here's the bourbon.}
<A>__{he takes a bottle of bourbon from a hiding place. paul joins him. he pours a glass for paul.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{was that a present from rosa, too?}
<A>__{he pours a glass for himself.}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{i don't really like bourbon, but rosa wanted me to keep a bottle here in my room.}
<A>__{he sits back down.}
<C>__{marcel }
<D>__{i was asking myself this question. if, with these little things, unimportant things, we could go back over things, and understand together.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{together?}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{it's almost a year that rosa and i... not passionately, but regularly... i thought i knew her as much as you can know...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{your mistress...}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{for example, a while ago, something happened that i still don't understand. do you see there, on the wall?}
<A>__{he points to a spot on the wall above them.}
<C>__{marcel }
<D>__{she had climbed onto the bed and she was trying to tear at the walls with her hands. i stopped her because she was breaking her nails. she had a strange... violence about her. i'd never seen her like that.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{our room is painted white. rosa wanted it to be different from the other rooms in the hotel.}
<A>__{marcel takes some lips salve from his bathrobe pocket.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{to make it look like... a more normal home. but... it had to be changed here, too. i think she started with the wall.}
<A>__{paul takes notice of the lip salve operation.}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{a cold sore. i don't know. shit.}
<A>__{paul regards him for a second.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you're lucky huh? you were... you must have been very handsome 20 years ago.}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{not as much as you.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you've still got all your hair.}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{my hair... i have to have it trimmed often. and wash it. i wash it nearly every day.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{don't you have massages?}
<A>__{he massages his own temples.}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{yes, i do.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you're in good shape.}
<A>__{he paws at marcel's stomach.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{what do you do for... your stomach? that's my problem.}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{for that...}
<A>__{he gazes across the room.}
<C>__{marcel }
<D>__{i have a secret.}
<A>__{he gets up and heads across the room.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{tell me!}
<A>__{he takes a bar from the floor and slides it into a spot on the top of a door frame.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{ah...}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{are you leaving us? i saw your suitcase was packed. ah... america. why was she unfaithful to you?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you can't believe that rosa... killed herself. it's hard for me to... believe, too.}
<A>__{while paul has a moment of reflection, marcel shows him his pull up leg kick combo on his pull up bar.}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{this is my secret! thirty times every morning.}
<A>__{paul leaves, disgusted.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(english)}
<D>__{really, marcello, i wonder what she ever saw in you.}
