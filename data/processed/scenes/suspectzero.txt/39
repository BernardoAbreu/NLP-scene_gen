<A>__{a three story victorian residence in decay, next door to a church soup kitchen in the middle of oklahoma city's skid row. rain falls. the street is still. mackelway approaches this halfway house. a few lights shine within, and the blue glow of a tv. upstairs can be heard the strident, off key voice of somebody singing.}
<L>__{exterior interior hope house doorway continuing}
<A>__{the front door is open. through a screen door, mackelway can see an old fashioned "foyer." he knocks. waits. two sounds dominate: the buzz from that tv, and the strident singing, which we realize is an a capela version of "la vida loca" audible through an open bedroom window. but no one's coming to answer the door, and it's wide open anyway... so mackelway enters.}
