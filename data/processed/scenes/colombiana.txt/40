<L>__{exterior rough neighborhood night}
<A>__{the denizens of this world look every bit as dangerous as they are. gangbangers, con artists, trouble waiting to happen at every turn.}
<B>__{angle on cat}
<A>__{cat, walking down the block as the eyes of everyone she passes follow her. she stops on a street corner. seems lost. opposite her a group of men, hanging outside a bar see her. the leader of the group calls her over.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{hey kid. you know what time it is?}
<A>__{cat shakes her head.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{it's late, and this is not the kind of place a kid should be hanging out. what are you doing here?}
<A>__{cat hands him her paper. he looks at her, suspicious.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{cataleya.}
<A>__{the man takes a moment...}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{wait here.}
<A>__{he disappears up a small alley into the darkness beyond. cat, not knowing what to do, sits down on the curb, watches street life. she sees... hookers soliciting men in passing cars. cops sitting in a patrol car, bored, blase. men playing craps against a wall. some very discreet dope deals, more sleight of hand than anything else.}
<B>__{close on a fist colliding with a face}
<A>__{a very bloodied face. once, twice, three times.}
<B>__{pull back to}
