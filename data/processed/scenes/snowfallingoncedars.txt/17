<L>__{interior courtroom morning}
<A>__{whaley stares down the end of his needle nose. the air of disdain of a man playing chess with an unworthy opponent.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{so this...foam you found in the lungs. how does it get there?}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{as i testified. it occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration. i believe i said that.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{but a drowned person can't breathe.}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{of course not. the foam means that he went in breathing.}
<A>__{ah.}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{that's why the autopsy report identifies drowning as the cause of death.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{your report says death by drowning , which means he went into the water alive and breathing. and the report is accurate...?}
<C>__{whaley }
<D>__{of course it's accurate, but...}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{of course, it is. now as to the head injury. you say made by an object narrow and flat. that is your inference , correct?}
<C>__{whaley }
<D>__{it's my job to infer, that's what coroners do. you get hit with a crowbar, or a ball peen hammer, or fall off a motorcycle, the injuries look different, that's my area of expertise.}
<A>__{nels nods. he can be quiet now. the witness distracted from volunteering the opinions nels did not wish for.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{in your motorcycle example. those injuries are produced by the head being propelled against an object. rather than the reverse, yes?}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{obviously.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around? or would both look the same.}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{the same.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{so if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{if the head was moving fast enough, but i don't see how it could be.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{is it possible?}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{sure, anything's poss...}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{is it fair to say that you do not know for certain which it was.}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{i already said that, b...}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{and that you can't say for certain whether the head injury was sustained before or after death?}
<A>__{whaley thinks.}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{for certain, no.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{but you are certain that he died by drowning.}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{for the third time, yes.}
<A>__{nels nods. whaley is beyond frustrated.}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{can i say something, here?}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand. the report says 'recent origin'. how recent? as much as 24 hours before death?}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{absolutely not. probably one or two hours. four at the most.}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{are you absol...}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{yes , i'm sure.}
<A>__{nels nods. silence.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{thank you, horace. no more questions.}
<A>__{horace wants to say more. doesn't immediately move.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{we'll take our luncheon recess. reconvene at...2 o'clock sharp.}
<A>__{the gavel cracks onto the block. judge fielding stands to leave, and the bailiff begins to usher the jury from its box. abel martinson, the deputy, stands near as kabuo rises. as he puts his hand gently on kabuo's arm, the defendant turns smoothly... ...to face a woman. standing at the rail. and beneath the courtroom buzz...}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{how are the kids?}
<A>__{the voice so colloquially american, we are taken back. having envisioned kabuo as a silent samurai.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{they need their father.}
<A>__{the look holds. abel increasingly uneasy.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{well. just a few more days.}
<C>__{abel }
<D>__{look, art's gonna want me t...}
<C>__{kabuo }
<D>__{you look beautiful.}
<A>__{abel grasps his arm.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{i look terrible. don't sit so straight like tojo's soldier. the jury will be afraid of you.}
<A>__{he thinks about that. abel tugs him.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{okay, i will hide under the table from now on. that make you happy?}
<A>__{and for the first time. he smiles. and seems suddenly very american indeed. she stares back, her heart in her eyes. abel tugs harder, but he can't budge the defendant.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{i'm not going until you smile.}
<A>__{but she doesn't. so his fades. one last look. and he lets abel lead him away. hold on her. watching him go.}
