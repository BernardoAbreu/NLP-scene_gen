<L>__{interior tracy's apartment day}
<A>__{a knock at the front door. after a moment, tracy comes into the front hallway and, crossing to the door, stubs her toe on the open closet door. she swears under her breath and angrily slams the closet door shut. then, grabbing her injured toe, she hops to the front door.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{who is it?}
<C>__{clifford }
<D>__{my name's john clifford. i'm a private investigator.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{a what?}
<C>__{clifford }
<D>__{a private detective.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{what do you want with me?}
<C>__{clifford }
<D>__{i'd just like to talk, ask a few questions.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{i've got nothing to say about anything or anybody.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{clifford }
<D>__{listen, lady, i can be back in thirty minutes with a search warrant and a handful of cops, and i can probably have you arrested, whether or not the charges would stick. now do you want to let me in and talk?}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{have you got a badge?}
<C>__{clifford }
<D>__{i will show you a badge when you open the goddamn door!}
<A>__{tracy unbolts the door and opens it. clifford walks right in and closes the door behind him.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{i don't carry a badge. i'm issued a license, a piece of paper, and i left it at home. you're tracy fuller?}
<A>__{tracy nods.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{can we sit down?}
<A>__{tracy leads him into the living room. they sit. clifford gives her a picture.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{do you recognize this man?}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{clifford lets out a sigh of frustration, realizing that this woman will continue to be difficult.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{he's escaped from the insane asylum. in 1972, he murdered two children... broke into a house and found them asleep in bed. it was a little boy, five an a half, and a little three year old girl. after the coroner's investigation, their bodies were taken to the mortuary, where the undertaker took one look at them and said he couldn't have their bodies reconstructed for the funeral without six days of steady work. then he asked what had been the murder weapon, because looking at the mess in front of him, he couldn't imagine what had been used. the coroner told him there had been no murder weapon. the killer had used only his hands.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the undertaker went to work and had them done in four.}
<A>__{the picture falls out of tracy's hands. she is stunned to the point of nausea.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{tracy}
<P>__{(barely able to say it)}
<D>__{he's been here.}
