<A>__{a murky sound of displeasure emanates round the arena. the audience don't know who he is and don't care either.}

<D>__{and in the other corner a man that needs no introduction to destruction, the solo warrior of walthamstow, sometimes known as buckshot peter, or sometimes known as the dictator to the devastator, he put the ' e ' in eradicate, the ' o ' in obliterate and the ' a 1 in annihilate, you know this monster of a monster, the sinister prime minister.. . .

<D>__{now i want a good dirty fight lads, so now it's that time again.. let's. . . . get ready to rrrrrrummmmmble.}
<A>__{the two come out to fight. bomber harris lifts his monster hands to do damage. they pace each other for a second. then micky lets one go. it hits bomber harris square on the jaw this has the effect of forcing blood out of his ears the man is positively out cold. we crashtrack into various characters' reactions: brick top, turkish and tommy etc. all are in shock. the ref (who is obviously paid off as well) tries to resuscitate harris but it's not happening, he catches a look of desperation from one of the villains and is eventually left with little choice but to hold micky's hand up. we cut to the nasty looking characters that we saw before they have approached with their heavies, and they are obviously not satisfied.}
