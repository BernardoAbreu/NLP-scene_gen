<L>__{interior campus library day}
<A>__{autumn sits at a tutorial table, looking at her notes. she becomes aware of someone approaching. she looks up to see darnell.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{hey, autumn.}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{hi, darnell. what are you doin here?}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{my advisor says i need a tutor. ya know, just to get me over a couple rough spots.}
<P>__{(showing her a paper)}
<D>__{i saw your name on this list. i figured if you couldn't keep my attention, nobody could.}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{i'm sorry, darnell, but i've already been assigned. you're gonna have to find somebody else. i'm tutoring scott sherman.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{not anymore. i asked coach winters to switch us.}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{coach winters wouldn't do that.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{yeh he would. i'm a bigger prospect than sherman.}
<P>__{(pointing across the way)}
<D>__{he's a lineman on the scout team.}
<A>__{autumn looks back to where darnell is pointing. sure enough, scott sherman is hard at work with another tutor. autumn can't believe it. she tries to compose herself. darnell sits down across the table from her.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{c'mon autumn, you could teach me some real erudition.}
<C>__{autumn}
<P>__{(trying to whisper, pissed)}
<D>__{will you stop using those big words. it sounds ridiculous.}
<C>__{darnell}
<P>__{(serious about this)}
<D>__{what doya mean? i'm improvin' myself. i learn a new word out of the dictionary every day. mendacious, pejorative, antithetical, commensurate...}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{and you don't ever use them right. pretending to be smart is not the same as being educated. or erudite. it's just a con. and it makes you sound stupid, no matter how big a prospect you are.}
<A>__{darnell is genuinely hurt by this dose of reality. his customary bravado melts away.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{o.k... even more reason for you to be my tutor. you already taught me something.}
<A>__{autumn, disarmed by his sudden humility, has no real rebuttal. she would have had to tutor him anyway, but now she's having trouble being angry about it.}
<B>__{alvin mack}
<A>__{at another table, looking distracted and bored as his tutor reads his history assignment to him. alvin takes out a walkman and puts the headphones on. we hear a horn beep.}
