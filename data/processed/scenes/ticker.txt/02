<A>__{they share a grin, pass a bag lady who wears a pie tin crown, holding her hand out to a pimp getting into a cadillac.}
<C>__{bag lady}
<D>__{a small gift, sir, for the queen ...}
<A>__{the pimp ignores her, screeches off. the bag lady pulls out a pad, adds his license number to a list, glances up at rice and reilly.}
<C>__{bag lady }
<D>__{i keep a record, see? they don't pay, i don't forget.}
<A>__{rice fishes some change out of his pocket.}
<C>__{rice}
<D>__{here you go, your highness.}
<C>__{bag lady}
<D>__{thank you, officer.}
<A>__{she pushes her shopping cart away. rice and reilly look at each other, crack up, surprised she knew he was a cop.}

<C>__{rice}
<D>__{one of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. when that happens, you'll wish you had family.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{no thanks. i got close but it never woulda worked.}
<A>__{they stop beside a dirty, beat up studebaker parked in the alley, climb in, reilly behind the wheel.}
<B>__{inside the studebaker}
<A>__{cluttered with debris clothes, boxes, personal items. reilly jiggles the ignition the engine coughs and sputters, finally turns over.}
<C>__{rice}
<D>__{why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{what are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.}
<C>__{rice}

<D>__{what was it this time?}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{she wanted to cook me breakfast.}
<A>__{the white van appears up ahead and turns into a seemingly deserted building's garage. reilly and rice exchange a glance as they wait to see lights come on in the building. they don't. two flashlight beams criss cross through the windows of the building briefly, then disappear. they hear a brief heated argument, that is cut short abruptly. then silence.}
<C>__{reilly }
<D>__{c'mon, let's check it out.}
<C>__{rice}
<D>__{we're vice, i didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. but if you're so gung ho, we'd best call it in for some back up.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{nah, let's just take a look see.}
<A>__{reilly jumps out and heads for the building. rice rolls his eyes, follows.}
