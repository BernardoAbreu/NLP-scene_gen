<L>__{interior. construction zone sector six day}
<A>__{an arc of blue light. a uniformed worker steers a plasma torch over a conduit. in the fog of smoke, we see wires being spliced, circuits, tested. outsiders in hardhats, goggles and cup masks. lincoln comes over the crosswalk, starkly contrasted in dacron coveralls and a hooded gasmask. the crew foreman intercepts him drawn, desiccated features, a husky drawl. his name is mccord }
<C>__{mccord}
<D>__{sorry, chief. i can't let you get any closer. we got live wires over there.}
<A>__{lincoln's reply is muffled by the gasmask, lost in the noise.}
<C>__{mccord}
<D>__{what's that you said?}
<A>__{lincoln repeats to no avail. frustrated, he peels off his gasmask }
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i said i can't hear you.}
<A>__{m c c o r d c h u c k l e s at the irony.}
<C>__{mccord}

<C>__{lincoln}

<C>__{mccord}
<D>__{i guess if we bust our backs, we could be out of here by the end of the week.}
<C>__{lincoln}
