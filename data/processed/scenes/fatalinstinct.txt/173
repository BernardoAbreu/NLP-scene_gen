<A>__{lana's feet step out of the tub, water dripping all around. she picks up the pointed saw from the floor.}
<B>__{on the landing}
<A>__{ned and laura still embrace, her forearms crisscrossed behind his neck. it's been a long embrace. suddenly, lana and lola both appear, screaming like banshees! lana charges from the bathroom, grasping the sharp saw blade! lola races at them from the stairway... with the ice pick! without missing a beat, laura raises the barrels of both guns and fires at them simultaneously... right next to ned's ears. the impact of one bullet knocks lana all the way back through the bathroom, crashing spectacularly out the window! the other bullet sends lola flipping down the staircase! ned looks stunned, his eyes crossed... the thundering gunshots still ringing in his ears. laura proudly blows the gunsmoke away from the end of each barrel.}
