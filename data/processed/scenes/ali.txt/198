<L>__{interior n'sele gym speed bag day}
<A>__{a syncopated, obscuring, blurred shape of the bag turned into a percussion instrument by ali's fast hands trying to get even faster.}
<C>__{ali}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{faster! faster!}
<C>__{dundee}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{time!}
<A>__{ali slams a right hook at the bag. it almost explodes. optional: ali takes body hits, tries sliding off head shots.}
<L>__{interior ring ali's eyes}
<A>__{feints his left and throws a right. it surprises holmes.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you can't lead a right hand. not at him!}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{too long...to get it there. man, i mean, to think you could hit him with a right lead...it's insulting... nobody would lead a right...}
<A>__{ali sees something beyond the ring. and, now, flicks four ripping left jabs into holmes and slides sideways as holmes tries to catch ali with a right. but ali changes directions, changes back and now comes over holmes' right with his own left cross, and a six or seven punch combination. it is ali dancing and floating. crowd cheers..."time."}
<B>__{bundini}
<A>__{meanwhile, has thrown his arms around dick sadler, foreman's manager. (we realize this is why ali segued from serious work to snapping his traditional left jab.)}
<C>__{bundini}
<D>__{i got him! lock him up.}
<C>__{sadler}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{hey, hold up, chump! make this chump turn me loose.}
<A>__{sadler's there with his wife and another couple. rudy joins, laughing. bundini turns loose sadler. ali and sadler like each other.}
<C>__{sadler }
<D>__{this is my wife, irene...}
<A>__{sadler affectionately puts an arm around ali's neck and reaches up and pretends to hit ali on top of the head with a fist for bingham's camera. ali bites his lower lip and starts wrestling with sadler, putting him in a headlock. sadler's arm is around ali's waist.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{hey! look! look at george foreman's trainer, feelin' me up on purpose! on the side, to see if i'm in shape!}
<A>__{more laughter. sadler's beret falls off. rudy puts it back on.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{can i have your autograph?}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{we'll, you ain't gonna find no fat! watch out!!}
<C>__{sadler}
<P>__{(lunges for wife's note pad)}
<D>__{give me that thing!}
<C>__{bingham}
<P>__{(breaking through)}
<D>__{muhammad. give her an ali button!}
<A>__{the gang laughs.}
<C>__{sadler}
<D>__{no, you ain't.}
<P>__{(concedes)}
<D>__{all right, give my wife an ali button.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{she's gotta put it on.}
<C>__{sadler}
<D>__{give my wife one.}
<C>__{bingham}
<D>__{bo'dini, you got ali buttons?}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{"george" buttons is all i got. in my bedroom! all over the bed! everywhere! to remind me...of all of ya'. all of ya'! reminds me of all ya'!}
<A>__{throughout the above he's pretending to jab at dick, who's laughing and feinting at him. it's raucous. fond relationships transcend the adversarial roles. they are all of the tribe of boxers. sadler is a particularly bright and talented man. meanwhile...}
