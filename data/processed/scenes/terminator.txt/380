<L>__{interior exterior drainage culvert night}
<A>__{angle looking out from the mouth of an enclosed concrete storm drain that passes under the road. reese, followed by sarah, trudges down the slope and ducks inside. the floor is wet but he doesn't seem to mind. they both hunker down with their backs to the concrete, facing each other. they look beaten, grimy, exhausted. she huddles under the blanket, waif like.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{you cold?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{freezing.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{come here.}
<A>__{she sits beside him and they wrap their arms around each other with the blanket covering both of them.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{reese...you got a first name?}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{kyle.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{kyle, what's it like when you go through time?}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{white light. pain. like being ripped inside out... slowly. like being born, maybe.}
<A>__{sarah scowls and draws her hand out from under his jacket.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you're wet. oh my god.}
<A>__{in the beam of the flashlight her hand is glistening with blood.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{i caught one, back there.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{caught one? you mean you got shot?}
<A>__{reese shrugs.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{it's not bad.}
<A>__{sarah sits up and turns toward him.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{we gotta get you to a doctor.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{it's okay. forget it.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{forget it? are you crazy? let me see it.}
<A>__{sarah opens his jacket and the flashlight beam shows his shirt bloodsoaked at the shoulder.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{jeez. you idiot. take this off.}
<A>__{she cradles the flashlight between her knees and opens the first aid kit as he removes his jacket.}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(looking at the wound)}
<D>__{see. missed everything. passed through the meat.}
<A>__{sarah starts swabbing the flesh wound.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{this is gonna make me puke. talk about something.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{just talk. tell me about my son. is he tall?}
<A>__{she places a gauze pad in place and starts to wrap it.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{about my height. he has your }
<P>__{(winces)}
<D>__{...damn...he has your eyes.}
<A>__{sarah glances at his face for a second and then goes back to work.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{what's he like?}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(thoughtful)}
<D>__{you trust him. he's got that strength. you'd die in a second for john.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{well, at least i know what to name him. i don't suppose you'd know who the father is? so i don't tell him to get lost when i meet him.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{john never said much about him. he dies. even before the war...}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{stop! i don't want to know. hold still. so...it was john that ordered you here?}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{i volunteered.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you volunteered?}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{it was an honor. a chance to meet the legend. sarah connor. who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. from when he was a kid. when you were in hiding, before the war.}
<A>__{she stops taping. she seems lost, her bravado dissipated.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you talk about things i haven't done yet in the past tense. it's making me crazy. i can't think.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{are you sure you've got the right person?}
<A>__{reese appraises her coldly.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{i'm sure.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{come on, me? the mother of the future? am i tough? organized? i can't even balance my checkbook. i cry when i see a cat that's been run over... and i don't even like cats.}
<A>__{she pulls the bandage tight with a knot.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{ow! no, it's okay. it's better tight.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{and anyway, what do i know about guerrilla warfare?}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{you'll learn.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{look, reese, i didn't ask for this honor and i don't want it. any of it.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{john gave me a message for you. made me memorize it. 'sarah"...this is the message... 'sarah, thank you. for your courage through the dark years. i can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will. you must be stronger than you imagine you can be. you must survive, or i will never exist.' that's all.}
<A>__{sarah stares at him as the enormity of it all becomes real to her. reese moves his arm, testing the bandage.}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{good field dressing.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(brightening)}
<D>__{you like it? it's my first.}
<A>__{he rebuttons his shirt and they return to the warmth conserving embrace. sarah gazes out the entrance, into the night.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{sleep. it'll be light soon.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(closing her eyes)}
<D>__{okay. talk some more.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(murmuring)}
<D>__{about where you're from.}
<A>__{kyle watches the helicopter circling far in the distance.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{alright.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you stay down by day, but at night you can move around. the h k's use infra red so you still have to watch out. but they're not too bright. john taught us ways to dust them them. that's when the infiltra tors started to appear. the terminators were the newest, the worst...}
<A>__{during his monologue we have panned into the darkness outside and to the helicopter, which flies out of frame, leaving black. a rotor roar fades up.}
