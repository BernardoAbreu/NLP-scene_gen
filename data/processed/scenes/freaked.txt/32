<L>__{interior freak house}
<A>__{it takes a few moments for rick's eyes to adjust to the dim light. there's nobody in sight. the walls are lined with dark cubicles, stacked atop each other with walkways like prison cells. rick staggers to his feet, and makes his way forward.}

<A>__{juan scratches himself behind the ear with his hind leg.}
<C>__{juan}
<D>__{welcome to hell, rick. shake?}
<A>__{he extends a hand to rick. rick doesn't take it. he hears a slight rustling noise from the direction of the cubicles, and turns to look around the apparently empty freak house.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{no thanks. i don't plan on staying long. how many of you are there in here anyway?}
<A>__{juan shrugs mischievously and sticks his snout in rick's face.}
<C>__{juan}
<D>__{first, i have a question for you, ricardo. who starred in the film "international velvet?"}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{juan}
<D>__{well, perhaps we should ask the worm!}
<A>__{the top right cubicle lights up, revealing the worm. he is a man with no arms and legs, and the wrinkly, slimy body of a worm. his face is learned looking, with spectacles, a small goatee, and a pipe which he puffs on pompously.}
<C>__{juan}
<D>__{tell us, worm, who starred in "international velvet?"}
<A>__{he puffs pensively on his pipe for a second.}
<C>__{the worm}
<D>__{yes, yes ... very interesting... international velvet... the perfectly appalling sequel to national velvet, i believe. no dramatic verisimilitude whatsoever.}
<C>__{juan}
<D>__{yes, worm. but who was the star?}
<A>__{the worm takes a long, thoughtful drag on his pipe...}
<C>__{worm}
<D>__{olivia dehavilland.}
<C>__{juan}
<D>__{olivia dehavilland... rick, do you agree or disagree?}
<C>__{rick}
