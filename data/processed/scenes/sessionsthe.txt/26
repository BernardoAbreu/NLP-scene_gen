<L>__{exterior carmen's driveway. day}
<A>__{vera wheels mark towards his first interview. the more we see vera, the more we like her.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{there was no denying it. a door had opened which i could not close, and in invisible writing it said: "do not enter".}
<L>__{interior carmen's place. day}
<A>__{we see the slowly rotating reels of a portable cassette recorder. we hear a female voice.}
<C>__{carmen }
<D>__{some positions, like that one, are pretty much impossible.}
<A>__{carmen, early 30s, is a paraplegic in a wheelchair. she is pretty and animated, and has full use of her hands.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{i don't know if you can quite visualize it. it's called a lateral, or sideways reverse cow girl.}
<A>__{it is obvious that mark cannot visualize it. although she doesn't give much away, we sense that vera can.}
<C>__{carmen }
<D>__{don't worry about it then. it's just a question of depth of penetration.}
<C>__{carmen }
<D>__{to some people it's really important, like my partner, for example. it's not such a big deal for me. i get just as excited when he licks my nipples, if and when he bothers to do it.}
<A>__{mark looks troubled.}
<C>__{carmen }
<D>__{i think the tape's about to run out.}
<A>__{at that very moment, there is a click, and the tape runs out. vera flips the tape over, sets it running in record mode, and takes her place again behind mark's gurney.}
<C>__{carmen }
<D>__{do you want to keep going?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{uh, i think i've actually got enough to work on. thanks.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{get back to me if you need anything else. oh, and let me give you greg's phone number. he's full of stuff you wouldn't think was possible.}
