<B>__{camera high}
<A>__{activity on the eleventh floor below. typewriters working, adding machines, filing clerks, secretaries, and so forth. neff, wearing his hat and carrying his briefcase, enters from the vestibule. he walks towards his office. he passes a few salesmen, etc. there is an exchange of greetings. just as he reaches his office a secretary comes out. she stops.}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{oh, mr. neff, mr. keyes wants to see you. he's been yelling for you all afternoon.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{is he sore, or just frothing at the mouth a little? here, park these for me, sweetheart.}
<A>__{he hands her his hat and briefcase and continues right on, camera with him, to a door lettered:}
<D>__{barton keyes claims manager}
<A>__{keyes' voice is heard inside, plenty loud. neff grins as he opens the door and goes in. a 34 keyes: office (day) a minor executive office, not too tidy: large desk across one corner, good carpet, several chairs, filing cabinet against one wall, a dictaphone on the corner of the desk. keyes is sitting behind the desk with his coat off but his hat on. a cigar is clamped in his mouth, ashes falling like snow down his vest, a gold chair and elk's tooth across it. on the other side of the desk sits sam gorlopis. he is a big, dumb bruiser, six feet three inches tall a dirty work shirt and corduroy pants, rough, untidy hair, broad face, small piggish eyes. he holds a sweat soaked hat on his knee with a hairy hand. he is chewing gum rapidly. as neff opens the door, keyes is giving it to gorlopis.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{wise up, gorlopis. you're not kidding anybody with that line of bull. you're in a jam and you know it.}
<C>__{gorlopis}
<D>__{sez you. all i want is my money.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{sez you. all you're gonna get is the cops.}
<A>__{he sees neff standing inside the door.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{come in, walter. this is sam gorlopis from inglewood.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{sure, i know mr. gorlopis. wrote a policy on his truck. how are you, mr. gorlopis?}
<C>__{gorlopis}
<D>__{i ain't so good. my truck burned down.}
<A>__{he looks cautiously sideways at keyes.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{yeah, he just planted his big foot on the starter and the whole thing blazed up in his face.}
<C>__{gorlopis}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{and didn't even singe his eyebrows.}
<C>__{gorlopis}
<D>__{no sir. look, mister. i got twenty six hundred bucks tied up in that truck. i'm insured with this company and i want my money.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{you got a wife, gorlopis?}
<C>__{gorlopis}
<D>__{sure i got a wife.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{you got kids?}
<C>__{gorlopis}
<D>__{two kids.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{what you got for dinner tonight?}
<C>__{gorlopis}
<D>__{we got meat loaf.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{how do you make your meat loaf, gorlopis?}
<C>__{gorlopis}
<D>__{veal and pork and bread and garlic. greek style.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{how much garlic?}
<C>__{gorlopis}
<D>__{lotsa garlic, mr. keyes.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{okay, gorlopis. now listen here. let's say you just came up here to tell me how to make meat loaf. that's all, understand? because if you came up here to claim on that truck, i'd have to turn you over to the law, gorlopis, and they'd put you in jail. no wife. no kids }
<C>__{gorlopis}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{keyes}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{and no meat loaf, gorlopis!}
<C>__{gorlopis}
<D>__{i didn't do nothin'.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{no? look, gorlopis. every month hundreds of claims come to this desk. some of them are phonies, and i know which ones. how do i know, gorlopis?}
<P>__{(he speaks as if to a child)}
<D>__{because my little man tells me.}
<C>__{gorlopis}
<D>__{what little man?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{the little man in here.}
<A>__{he pounds the pit of his stomach.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{every time one of those phonies comes along he ties knots in my stomach. and yours was one of them, gorlopis. that's how i knew your claim was crooked. so what did i do? i sent a tow car out to your garage this afternoon and they jacked up that burned out truck of yours. and what did they find, gorlopis? they found what was left of a pile of shavings.}
<C>__{gorlopis}
<D>__{what shavings?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{the ones you soaked with kerosene and dropped a match on.}
<A>__{gorlopis cringes under the impact.}
<C>__{gorlopis}
<D>__{look, mr. keyes, i'm just a poor guy. maybe i made a mistake.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{that's one way of putting it.}
<C>__{gorlopis}
<D>__{i ain't feelin' so good, mr. keyes.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{sign this and you'll feel fine.}
<A>__{he puts a blank form in front of him and points.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{right there. it's a waiver on your claim.}
<A>__{gorlopis hesitates, then signs laboriously.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{now you're an honest man again.}
<C>__{gorlopis}
<D>__{but i ain't got no more truck.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{goodbye, gorlopis.}
<C>__{gorlopis}
<P>__{(still bewildered)}
<D>__{goodbye, mr. keyes.}
<A>__{he stands up and goes slowly to the door and turns there.}
<C>__{gorlopis}
<D>__{twenty six hundred bucks. that's a lot of dough where i live.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{what's the matter, gorlopis? don't you know how to open the door? just put your hand on the knob, turn it to the right, pull it toward you }
<C>__{gorlopis}
<P>__{(doing just as keyes says)}
<D>__{like this, mr. keyes?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{that's the boy. now the same thing from the outside.}
<C>__{gorlopis}
<P>__{(stupefied)}
<D>__{thank you, mr. keyes.}
<A>__{he goes out, closing the door after him. keyes takes his cigar stub from his mouth and turns it slowly in the flame of a lighted match. he turns to neff.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{what kind of an outfit is this anyway? are we an insurance company, or a bunch of dimwitted amateurs, writing a policy on a mugg like that?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{wait a minute, keyes. i don't rate this beef. i clipped a note to that gorlopis application to have him thoroughly investigated before we accepted the risk.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{i know you did, walter. i'm not beefing at you. it's the company. the way they do things. the way they don't do things. the way they'll write anything just to get it down on the sales sheet. and i'm the guy that has to sit here up to my neck in phony claims so they won't throw more money out of the window than they take in at the door.}
<C>__{neff}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{okay, turn the record over and let's hear the other side.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{i get darn sick of picking up after a gang of fast talking salesmen dumb enough to sell life insurance to a guy that sleeps in the same bed with four rattlesnakes. i've had twenty six years of that, walter, and i }
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{and you loved every minute of it, keyes. you love it, only you worry about it too much, you and your little man. you're so darn conscientious you're driving yourself crazy. you wouldn't even say today is tuesday without you looked at the calendar, and then you would check if it was this year's or last year's calendar, and then you would find out what company printed the calendar, then find out if their calendar checks with the world almanac's calendar.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{that's enough from you, walter. get out of here before i throw my desk at you.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i love you, too.}
<A>__{he walks out, still grinning. a 35 exterior offices twelfth floor neff comes out of keys' office and walks back along the balcony. activity of secretaries going in and out of doors, etc. neff enters his own office.}
<C>__{neff's voice}
<P>__{(over scene)}
<D>__{i really did, too, you old crab, always yelling your fat head off, always sore at everyone. but behind the cigar ashes on your vest i kind of knew you had a heart as big as a house... back in my office there was a phone message from mrs. dietrichson about the renewals. she didn't want me to come tomorrow evening. she wanted me to come thursday afternoon at three thirty instead. i had a lot of stuff lined up for that thursday afternoon, including a trip down to santa monica to see a couple of live prospects about some group insurance. but i kept thinking about phyllis dietrichson and the way that anklet of hers cut into her leg.}
<A>__{a 36 interior neff's office anderson, a salesman, sits at one of the desks, filling out a report. neff enters, goes to his own desk. he looks down at some mail. on top there is a typewritten note. he reads it, sits down and leafs through his desk calendar. a 37 insert closeup calendar page showing date: thursday 23 may and five or six appointments penciled in tightly on the page.}
