<A>__{quoyle and alvin inspect quoyle's newly finished boat. it is a beauty, to be sure, and the old builder watches quoyle lovingly running his hand across the smooth gunnel. alvin doesn't smile. that's not his style.}
<C>__{alvin}
<D>__{gotta paint the name. what'll it be? 'the tall and quiet woman'?}

<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{my dad went over the side this mornin'. tangled in th' sling stone line.}
<A>__{a sob escapes from this strong man's throat. he ignores it. no one knows what to say.}
