<L>__{interior pepe's warehouse home day}
<A>__{the warehouse, is filled with piles of rusting scrap metal, the cannibalized carcasses of cars, trucks, shipping containers, welding equipment, hammers tongs, all sorts of tools. in the corner is one fully built truck, a big red monster with huge demolition fenders. this is home to old pepe, an ancient, blind man, who is working away, building yet another set of oversized chimes out of scrap metal.}

<C>__{pepe}
<D>__{if that's what you want to call it.}
<A>__{cat kisses pepe, taps one of the chimes, it makes the most ethereal sound as one chime bangs against the other. she opens a cupboard in the makeshift kitchen area, and starts unpacking the groceries.}
<C>__{pepe}
<D>__{did you get the beans i like?}

<A>__{the door opens, reveals shelves with dozens of passports, stacks of cash.}
<C>__{pepe}
<D>__{cataleya. no one knows what happens tomorrow, next year is a long time away. how was your trip?}
