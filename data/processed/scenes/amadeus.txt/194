<L>__{interior mozart's apartment living room night 1790's}
<A>__{mozart sits working frantically at this demonic music. his whole expression is one of wildness and engulfing fever. he pours wine down his throat, spilling it, and grimaces as it hits his stomach. all around him are manuscripts. there is a banging at the front door. mozart does not hear it; the music raves on. another knocking comes, louder. constanze appears from the bedroom and stares at her distracted husband. the knocking is repeated again, even more violently and insistently.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{wolfi. wolfi!}
<A>__{he looks at her. the music breaks off. silence. an enormous bang at the door startles him. constanze moves to open it.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{no. don't answer it!}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{mozart springs up. he is clearly terrified.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{tell him i'm not here. tell him i'm working on it. come back later.}
<A>__{he runs out of he room, into his workroom, and shuts he door. now a little scared herself, constanze goes to he front door and opens it cautiously. schikaneder stands there, floridly dressed as usual. lorl is seen peeking out from the kitchen.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{am i interrupting something?}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{not at all.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<P>__{(peering into he room)}
<D>__{where's our friend?}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{he's not in. but he's working on it. he said to tell you.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{i hope so. i need it immediately.}
<A>__{he pushes her into the room.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{is he happy with it?}
<A>__{he sees he manuscript on the table, and goes to it eagerly.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{is this it?}
<A>__{he picks up a page without waiting for a reply.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{what the devil is this? requiem mass? does he think i'm in the funeral business?}
<A>__{mozart opens he workroom door. we see him as schikaneder sees him: wild eyed, extremely pale and strange.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{leave that alone!}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{wolfi!}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{put it down!}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{put it down, i said! it's nothing for you.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{oh! i'm sorry! i'm sorry! what have you got for me? is it finished?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{what? the vaudeville, what'd you think?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{can i see it?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{because there's nothing to see.}
<A>__{he giggles triumphantly. schikaneder stares at him.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{look, i asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{well, we can.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{so let me see it. where is it?}
<A>__{mozart, with a bright, rather demented smile presents his head to schikaneder.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{here. it's all right here, in my noodle. the rest is just scribbling. scribbling and bibbling. bibbling and scribbling. would you like a drink?}
<A>__{he giggles. schikaneder suddenly grabs his lapels.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{look, you little clown, do you know how many people i've hired for you? do you know how many people are waiting?}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{leave him alone!}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{i'm paying these people. do you realize that?}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{he's doing his best.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{i'm paying people just to wait for you. it's ridiculous!}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{you know what's ridiculous? your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. only an idiot would ask wolfi to work on that stuff!}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{oh yes? and what's so intelligent about writing a requiem?}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{money! money!}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{you're mad! she's mad, wolfi.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{oh yes, and who are you? he's worked for kings. for the emperor.}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{schikaneder suddenly takes mozart by the arms, and speaks to him with intense appeal.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{listen, wolfi. write it. please. just write it down. on paper. it's no good to anyone in your head. and fuck the death mass.}
