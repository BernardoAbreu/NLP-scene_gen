<L>__{40 scene deleted interior cynthia bishop's apartment day}
<A>__{john sits on the edge of cynthia's bed, slowly undressing.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's just so blatantly stupid, i have a hard time believing you did it.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{what's so stupid about it?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{that you...you don't even know the guy.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{shit, after what you've told me, i don't know. i should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i like the way he dresses.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what if this tape gets into the wrong hands?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{"the wrong hands"? we're not talking about military secrets, john. they're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{jesus christ. and he doesn't have sex with any of them? they just talk?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{jesus. i could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{doesn't work. he has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{interact, fine, but did you have to masturbate in front of him, for god's sake? i mean...}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i felt like it, so what? goddam, you and ann make such a big deal out of it.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you told ann about this?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{of course. she is my sister. i tell her almost everything.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i wish you hadn't done that.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's just something i'd prefer she didn't know about.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{she's a grown up, she can handle it.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i just...ann is very...}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{hung up.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it just wasn't a smart thing to do. did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you realize you have no recourse legally? this stuff could show up anywhere.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{it won't. i trust him.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(disbelieving)}
<D>__{you trust him.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{yeah, i do. a helluva lot more than i trust you.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{exactly what i said. i'd trust him before i'd trust you. how much clearer can i be?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it hurts that you would say that to me.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{oh, please. come on, john. you're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. you're a liar. but at least i know you're a liar. it's the people that don't know, like ann, that have to watch out.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{by definition you're lying to ann, too.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{that's right. but i never took a vow in front of god and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{look, are we going to do it or not?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{actually, no, i've changed my mind. i shouldn't have called.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(ingratiating)}
<D>__{well, i'm here now. i'd like to do something...}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{how about straightening up the living room?}
<A>__{john doesn't smile.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{come on, john. you should be happy, we've gone this far without ann finding out, i'm making it real easy on you. just walk out of here and i will see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{did he put you up to this?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{graham.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{no, he didn't put me up to this. jesus, i don't need people to tell me what i should do. i've just been thinking about things, that's all.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i can't believe i let him stay in my house. right under my nose. that deviant fucker was right under my nose and i didn't see him.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{if he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(looks at her)}
<D>__{god, you...you're mean.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i know. will you please leave now?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{maybe i don't want to leave. maybe i want to talk.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{john, we have nothing to talk about.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i knew it, i knew it. things are getting complicated.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{no, john, things are getting real simple.}
