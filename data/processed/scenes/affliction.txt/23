<A>__{jack behind the wheel. beside him evan twombley, 60, fleshy, irish, wearing brand new scarlet wool pants, jacket and cap. he feeds on the misfortunes of others.}
<C>__{twombley}
<D>__{it's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. no advantage there, kid.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't worry, mr. twombley, i know where those suckers are. rain or shine, snow or no snow. i know deer. we'll kill us a buck today. guaranteed. before ten.}
<C>__{twombley}
<D>__{guaranteed, eh?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yep. right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. the bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.}
<P>__{(gestures to gun rack)}
<D>__{this gun gets fired before ten o'clock. whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. i will put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. that's what you're paying me for, ain't it?}
<C>__{twombley}
<D>__{damn straight!}
<A>__{hewitt looks at twombley's rifle: a winchester m 94 pump action, custom carved stock and not a scratch on it. never fired, at least not by twombley.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{done much shooting with that rifle yet?}
<C>__{twombley}
<P>__{(eyes him)}
<D>__{tell you what. you get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{if you get it?}
<C>__{twombley}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you might not kill it.}
<C>__{twombley}
<D>__{you think so.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you might gut shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. i may have to shoot it.}
<C>__{twombley}
<D>__{you take care of your end, kid, i will take care of mine.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{mmm.}
<C>__{twombley}
<D>__{you understand what i'm saying? i want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i get it.}
<P>__{(disdain)}
<D>__{no sweat. you'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. and you'll have him by coffee time.}
<C>__{twombley}
<D>__{and you'll get your extra hundred bucks.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{wonderful!}
