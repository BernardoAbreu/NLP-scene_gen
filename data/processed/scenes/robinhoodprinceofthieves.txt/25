<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior kitchen}
<A>__{liquid tumbles into a goblet. the three men at a table in the kitchen. the fat girl, sarah, who pretended to be marian, serves. flashes a lusty smile at aslan, who glances at robin "help!" marian arrives. in a gown. stunning. an impish grin.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{i trust lord locksley has recovered from his indisposition.}
<A>__{aslan laughs. robin glares.}
<L>__{exterior dubois mansion day}
<A>__{rock strewn hills. grazing sheep. sun peeking through clouds. robin and marian walk. anger and anguish in her voice.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{why would he wish me to be protected by the boy who burned my hair when i was a child?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{we were together five terrible years in a saracen prison.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{how do i know you didn't abandon him there to save your own skin.}

<C>__{marian}
<D>__{i will forward your condolences to my mother.}
<A>__{she turns her back. he searches for a way to reach her.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{on my return, i found my father dead. the sheriff denounced him as a druid and took our lands.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{the people fear the druids so much they'd believe anything. nottingham would have me burned at the stake as a witch if he thought he could possess my property.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{why do you not join your mother in london? you would be safer there.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{i will not retreat. besides, i have no interest in life at court. gossip mongering and currying favor. here i am my own person.}

<C>__{marian}
<D>__{my brother is dead. you cannot take his place.}
<A>__{robin grabs and holds her.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{marian, i don't want to replace him.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<A>__{their eyes meet... a sudden intimacy between them. robin moves closer. marian begins to respond, then pulls away.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{this is wrong.}
<A>__{she runs back to the house. robin stares after her. aslan appears in the doorway with duncan.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{robin! the old man hears horses. approaching fast.}
<A>__{he runs to a bluff... a column of soldiers snakes up the hillside.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{twenty or more. in battle armor.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{soldiers coming here? is this your protection?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i killed some of the sheriff's men. i fear i have placed you in danger.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{i can take care of myself. there are horses in the stable. go!}
<A>__{aslan runs into the stables.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i'm not leaving.}
<A>__{marian ices him with a glare. aslan reappears, with two bareback horses. soldiers appear on the crest, led by gisborne... with a mischievous grin, marian runs to the soldiers.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{stop them! they're stealing my horses!}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{damn the girl! aslan, can you ride?}
<A>__{in answer, aslan grins. leaps onto a horse. with a single swift move he hoists duncan up behind him and digs in his heels. the mare leaps forward, and over the estate wall.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{he can ride.}
<A>__{he heads his horse at the wall. it stumbles. barely clears it. stones fly. robin struggles to hold on. marian stands directly in gisborne's path.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{you have been sheltering outlaws, lady marian.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{they're thieves, you imbecile. bring back my horses, or the sheriff will know of your cowardice.}
<A>__{gisborne knows she is lying.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{you're lucky he didn't steal your virtue too.}
<P>__{(to his men)}
<D>__{a crown to the man who brings me locksley's head.}
<A>__{he leads the pursuit. a soldier hangs back. grabs marian's hair.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{a kiss for me, saxon bitch.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{kiss this!}
<A>__{she unsheathes the dagger from under her skirt. jabs the blade into his wrist.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{try me again, if you want to leave a hand behind.}
<A>__{shocked and pained, the man gallops away. marian looks down at her dagger hand. it shakes violently.}
