<L>__{exterior streets. day.}
<A>__{burbage and a solid wedge of the chamberlain's mend are cleaving a path through the crowds. their faces are grim.}
<L>__{interior the rose theatre. stage auditorium under the stage.}
<B>__{day.}
<A>__{we are in act iii scene i. ned alleyn as "mercutio" and nol as "benvolio", and two "montague" sidekicks are in occupation of the stage, when the "capulets" swagger in, four of them headed by james hemmings as "tybalt."}
<C>__{nol as benvolio}
<D>__{"by my head, here comes the capulets."}
<C>__{alleyn as mercutio}
<D>__{"by my heel, i care not."}
<C>__{james hemmings as tybalt}
<D>__{"follow me close, for i will speak to}
<P>__{them. (with bombast to "mercutio")}
<D>__{gentlemen, good e'en: a word with one of you."}
<A>__{ned comes out of character.}
<C>__{alleyn}
<D>__{are you going to do it like that? and before the humbled actor can reply ned continues.}
<C>__{alleyn }
<D>__{and but one word with one of us? couple it with something, make it a word and a blow.}
<A>__{but suddenly six more men and a dog invade the stage, ready to fight. burbage and the chamberlain's men have arrived to avenge burbage's honour with swords, clubs, and a bucket (containing pig swill).}
<C>__{burbage}
<D>__{where is that thieving hack who can't keep his pen in his own ink pot!?}
<A>__{will has already leapt up onto the stage.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what is this rabble?!}
<A>__{burbage aims a blow at will, who ducks and grabs a stave from the nearest actor, and parries the blow. he swings at burbage, a chamberlain's man swings at will, thomas cries out, someone else slashes the stage hangings bringing down the drapes, and in a moment the admiral's men and the chamberlain's men, using their much rehearsed skills, are brawling with weapons and fist, using everything short of unbuttoned rapiers. crab, the dog, is yapping and snapping at any legs he can reach. henslowe, a little slow to catch up on the situation, checks the page in his hand. fennyman, much slower to catch up, watches enthralled.}
<C>__{fennyman}
<P>__{(to henslowe)}
<D>__{wonderful, wonderful! and a dog!}
<A>__{but now henslowe has worked out that these actors don't belong, nor does the scene. he enters the fray, but his interest is protecting his property. big burly ralph is using a couple of unlit torches as weapons; he breaks one of them over an enemy's back and henslowe turns on ralph}
<C>__{henslowe}
<D>__{not with my props!}
<A>__{viola is doing well enough, tripping up an enemy with a well judged stave, and then using it to deflect a blow aimed at will}
<C>__{viola}
<D>__{will! what ?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{a literary feud. quite normal.}
<A>__{then he is smashed over the head. he falls off the stage taking viola with him. under the stage is a space (known as hell) and will shoves viola into this space.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{stay hid!}
<A>__{he gets back onto the stage, where the goings on are worthy of the four musketeers and robin hood combined, with sam gosse, dressed as "juliet," fighting with the best of them. there is a stack of cushions, stored for the expensive seats, and as the stack s knocked over, ned alleyn and others grab cushions to use as shields. soon cushions are being ripped, and the air is full of flying feathers. the trap door in the stage opens, viola's head pops up. she looks around and, surrounded by milling legs and floating feathers, a boot catches her sideways and half knocks her wig off. in danger of having her cover blown, she ducks down again, leaving the trap open just nicely for will to plummet down it.}
