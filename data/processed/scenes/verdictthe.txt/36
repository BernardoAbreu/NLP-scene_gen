<D>__{frank: i don't think i'm talking out of school, but i just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if i may say, you haven't got the best of records.}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{...things change.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{...that's true. sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. now, i remember back to when you were disbarred...}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{i wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{and it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i myself would take it and run like a thief.}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{i'm sure you would.}
