<L>__{68 milk bar. explosion. outside. day.}
<A>__{the jukebox is flung into the middle of the street. there is blood, strips of flesh, material, the same scene as at the cafeteria; the white smoke and shouts, weeping, hysterical girls' screams. one of them no longer has an arm and runs around, howling despairingly; it is impossible to control her. the sound of sirens is heard again. the crowd of people, the firemen, police, ambulances all rush to the scene from place bugeand. the ambulances arrive at rue michelet. they are already loaded with dead and wounded. the relatives of the wounded are forced to get out. the father of the child who was buying ice cream seems to be in a daze: he doesn't understand. they pull him down by force. the child remains there, his blond head a clot of blood. the policemen try to bring order to the chaos, are forced to shout, push, threaten. the wounded swarm around the ambulances. a commissioner sends off the first one.}
<C>__{commissioner}
<D>__{what time is it?}
<C>__{policeman}
<D>__{a quarter to seven.}
<A>__{the commissioner goes to the second ambulance, pulls down a man who is trying to enter by force, slams the door, and shouts to the driver. his face is pale and drawn; the veins of his neck are swollen.}
<C>__{commissioner}
<D>__{go away, for god's sake!}
<A>__{the auto leaves and now, the third explosion resounds in the distance. it is heard clearly and violently from the mauretania section. the commissioner stops midway in his last gesture, and likewise, all the others, who are paralyzed with fright, incapable of taking action again, of accepting such reality for a third time. in place bugeand, there also, the people are motionless. all of them are looking in the same direction. their faces are alike in their terror, alike in their sense of impotence, alike in their deep sadness.}
