<A>__{indy lands in a shower of glass on the jutting roof of the museum's first floor. he rolls to a crouch and is immediately being fired upon. the germans, cut off from the museum, are standing on the palace walkway firing at him. indy takes off fast for the rear of the museum.}

<A>__{kehoe, craning to locate indy, has the ford rolling slowly along the back of the museum. bang scouts from the back seat. indy appears on the roof at a run, gauges the movement of the car and jumps from the roof of the museum to the roof of the sedan. unfortunately, the roof of the old car can't take it and indy's legs knife right on through to the interior, where he scares the hell out of kehoe.}
