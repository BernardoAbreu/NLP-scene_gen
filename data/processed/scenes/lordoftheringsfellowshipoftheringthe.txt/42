<L>__{exterior bag end night}
<A>__{the party is still in an excited uproar... some 50 yards away as we pan across a moonlit lane to the front door of bag end. door opens, pulled by an invisible hand.}
<L>__{interior bag end night}
<A>__{the door quietly closes...bilbo materializes as he pulls a plain gold ring off his finger. bilbo laughs as he tosses the ring in the air, then places it in his pocket.}
<T>__{angle on:}
<A>__{bilbo emerges from the passage, carrying a walking stick. he finds gandalf looming over him.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{i suppose you think that was terribly clever?}
<C>__{bilbo}
<D>__{come on, gandalf! did you see their faces?}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{there are many magic rings in the world, bilbo baggins, and none of them should be used lightly.}
<C>__{bilbo}
<D>__{it was just a bit of fun. oh, you're probably right as usual.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{you will keep an eye on frodo, won't you?}
<C>__{bilbo}
<D>__{i'm leaving everything to him.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{what about this ring of yours? is that staying too?}
<A>__{close on: bilbo...he gives gandalf a look and nods toward the mantelpiece.}
<C>__{bilbo}
<D>__{yes, yes, it's in an envelope...over there on the mantelpiece. gandalf frowns at the empty mantelpiece...bilbo suddenly feels his waistcoat with a look of guilty surprise.}
<C>__{bilbo }
<D>__{no, wait. it's here in my pocket. isn't that...isn't' that odd now? yet, after all, why not? why shouldn't i keep it?}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{i think you should leave the ring behind, bilbo. is that so hard?}
<C>__{bilbo}
<D>__{well, no...and yes. now it comes to it, i don't feel like parting with it. it's mine. i found it. it came to me!}
<A>__{angle on: gandalf looks down at bilbo with rising concern.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{there's no need to get angry.}
<C>__{bilbo}
<D>__{well, if i'm angry, it's your fault! it's mine. my own, my precious.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{precious? it's been called that before, but not by you.}
<C>__{bilbo}
<D>__{so? what business is it of yours what i do with my own things? bilbo's voice, shape and manner have suddenly changed.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{i think you've had that ring quite long enough.}
<C>__{bilbo}
<D>__{you want it for yourself!}
<A>__{gandalf rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow suddenly seems to fill the room}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{bilbo baggins do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks! bilbo cowers from gandalf, disarmed by his power...a frightened hobbit. gandalf's expression softens.}
<C>__{gandalf }
<D>__{i am not trying to rob you. i am trying to help you. sobbing, bilbo runs to gandalf and hugs him.}
<C>__{gandalf }
<D>__{all you long years we've been friends...trust me as you once did. let it go!}
<C>__{bilbo}
<D>__{you're right, gandalf...the ring must go to frodo.}
<A>__{bilbo lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door.}
<C>__{bilbo }
<D>__{it's late, the road is long... yes, it is time.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{bilbo?}
<C>__{bilbo}
<D>__{hmmm?}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{the ring is still in your pocket.}
<A>__{bilbo hesitates...reaches into his pocket.}
<C>__{bilbo}
<D>__{oh, yes.}
<A>__{close on: bilbo pulls out the ring...he stares at it in his palm. with all his will power, bilbo allows the ring to slowly slide off his palm and drop to the floor. close on: the tiny ring lands with a heavy thud on the wooden floor.}
