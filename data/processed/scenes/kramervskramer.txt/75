<A>__{note: the following scene, which is written as one, is actually to be played so that each time we cut back to the woman who is being interviewed as housekeeper, it is a different woman: sometimes nervous and excited, sometimes large and lugubrious, with six shopping bags, sometimes looking like a headmistress at dachau. they are uniformly (until the last) unappetizing. throughout this, we see ted becoming increasingly desperate.}
