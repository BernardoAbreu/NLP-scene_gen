<L>__{interior dante's inferno night}
<A>__{alex flashes back into the real world. and then one by one, so do the others. it's a glorious sight. each one is heralded by buzzing static, and then a rippling in space, an image stuttering in and... pop! pop! pop! one after another come flashing back in bursts of light! there are dozens. the inferno is filled with them, like a flurry of flashbulbs going off. familiar faces and people we've never seen. benz, laurie, stilts, deloach... pop! and there's nick! and more, and still more! forty, fifty... just how many people did arcade take? everyone is grinning, crying, hugging one another.}
<B>__{space shimmers}
<A>__{just before alex. someone else is trying to fight their way back. it's greg. he's blinking back into reality.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{greg!!!}
<A>__{he flickers for a moment, tentative...}
<C>__{greg}
<P>__{(fading in and out)}
<D>__{alex! you did it!}
<A>__{...and then he's back for good. he wraps his arms around alex, grabbing her so tight that it's almost painful. both of them are sobbing.}
<C>__{greg}
<P>__{(in between kisses)}
<D>__{you did it...}
<A>__{together, the two of them start towards the door, eager to leave this place. in groups of twos and threes, the others follow.}
