<D>__{back to hell, asshole }
<A>__{her body undulates as mammon's shape tries to come through. pulsating through her arms, her chest her face. angela bites into his palm. john recoils. she shoves him off and john hits the tile hard. angela jumps from the tank, pushes past in a blur. john spins to see midnite standing right there angela now firmly in his size twelve grasp.}
