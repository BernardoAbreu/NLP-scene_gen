<A>__{patterson and starling standing on the high ground where the embankment will start. from here, there is a slope down to the river itself. also present is ungan signh, who we saw earlier standing precariously atop the water tower. singh, enormously powerful, is another assistant. bright, a great worker, another main character in what is to follow. now patterson starts to walk down the slope towards the river it's not that easy to do without falling, but that doesn't bother him. he talks and gestures as he explains to the other two who move down with him. singh, for all his massive size, moves like a cat. starling does not, slipping and sliding.}
