<ACTION>__{He is a bespectacled man in his thirties, hale but somewhat bookish. He stands, tuxedoed, in the wings of a theater, looking out at the stage, listening intently to end of a performance. In the shadows behind him an old stagehand leans against a flat, expressionlessly smoking a cigarette, one hand on a thick rope that hangs from the ceiling. The voices of the performing actors echo in from the offscreen stage:}

<ACTION>__{With this the stagehand behind Barton furiously pulls the rope hand-over-hand and we hear thunderous applause and shouts of "Bravo!" As the stagehand finishes bringing the curtain down, somewhat muting the applause, the backstage actor trots out of frame toward the stage. The stagehand pulls on an adjacent rope, bringing the curtain back up and unmuting the applause. Barton Fink seems dazed. He has been joined by two other men, both dressed in tuxedos, both beaming toward the stage. BARTON'S POV Looking across a tenement set at the backs of the cast as the curtain rises on the enthusiastic house. The actors take their bows and the cry of "Author, Author" goes up from the crowd. The actors turn to smile at Barton in the wings.}

The star of the Bare Ruined Choirs was not seen on the stage of the Belasco last night though the thespians involved all acquitted themselves admirably. The find of the evening was the author of this drama about simple folk fish mongers, in fact  whose brute struggle for existence cannot quite quell their longing for something higher. The playwright finds nobility in the most squalid corners and poetry in the most callused speech. A tough new voice in the American theater has arrived, and the owner of that voice is named... Barton Fink."}

<CHAR>__{GARLAND} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night  if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.}
<CHAR>__{BARTON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{To see pap.}
<CHAR>__{GARLAND} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.}
<CHAR>__{BARTON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-}

<ACTION>__{Barton leans earnestly forward.}
<CHAR>__{BARTON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, Garland, don't you see? Not the kind of success where the critics fawn over you or the producers like Derek make a lot of money. No, a real success  the success we've been dreaming about  the creation of a new, living theater of, about, and for the common man! If I ran off to Hollywood now I'd be making money, going to parties, meeting the big shots, sure, but I'd be cutting myself off from the wellspring of that success, from the common man.}
<ACTION>__{He leans back and chuckles ruefully.}
<CHAR>__{BARTON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.}
<CHAR>__{GARLAND} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism  if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.}
<ACTION>__{Barton glumly lights a cigarette and gazes out across the floor. Garland studies him.}
<CHAR>__{GARLAND} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{...Look, they love you, kid everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?}
<CHAR>__{BARTON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{GARLAND} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Take my copy. You're the toast of Broadway and you have the opportunity to redeem that for a little cash strike that, a lot of cash.}
<ACTION>__{Garland looks at Barton for a reaction, but gets none.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{HOTEL LOBBY}
<ACTION>__{A high wide shot from the front door, looking down across wilting potted palms, brass cuspidors turning green, ratty wing chairs; the fading decor is deco-gone-to-seed. Amber light, afternoon turning to evening, slopes in from behind us, washing the derelict lobby with golden highlights. Barton Fink enters frame from beneath the camera and stops in the middle foreground to look across the lobby. We are framed on his back, his coat and hat. The lobby is empty.  There is a suspended beat as Barton takes it in. Barton moves toward the front desk.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{THE REVERSE}
<ACTION>__{As Barton stops at the empty desk. He hits a small silver bell next to the register. Its ring-out goes on and on without losing volume. After a long beat there is a dull scuffle of shoes on stairs. Barton, puzzled, looks around the empty lobby, then down at the floor behind the front desk.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{A TRAP DOOR}
<ACTION>__{It swings open and a young man in a faded maroon uniform, holding a shoebrush and a shoe  not one of his own  climbs up from the basement. He closes the trap door, steps up to the desk and sticks his finger out to touch the small silver bell, finally muting it. The lobby is now silent again.}

<ACTION>__{SIXTH-FLOOR HALLWAY Barton walks slowly toward us, examining the numbers on the doors. The long, straight hallway is carpeted with an old stained forest green carpet. The wallpaper shows faded yellowing palm trees.  Barton sticks his key in the lock of a door midway down the hall.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{HIS ROOM}
<ACTION>__{As Barton enters. The room is small and cheaply furnished. There is a lumpy bed with a worn yellow coverlet, an old secretary table, and a wooden luggage stand. As Barton crosses the room we follow to reveal a sink and wash basin, a house telephone on a rickety night stand, and a window with yellowing sheers looking on an air shaft. Barton throws his valise onto the bed where it sinks, jittering.  He shrugs off his jacket. Pips of sweat stand out on Barton's brow. The room is hot. He walks across the room, switches on an oscillating fan and struggles to throw open the window. After he strains at it for a moment, it slides open with a great wrenching sound. Barton picks up his Underwood and places it on the secretary table. He gives the machine a casually affectionate pat. Next to the typewriter are a few sheets of house stationary: "THE HOTEL EARLE: A DAY OR A LIFETIME." We pan up to a picture in a cheap wooden frame on the wall above the desk. A bathing beauty sits on the beach under a cobalt blue sky. One hand shields her eyes from the sun as she looks out at a crashing surf. The sound of the surf mixes up.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{HIS POV}
<ACTION>__{A naked, peeling ceiling.  The hum  a mosquito, perhaps stops.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{BARTON}
<ACTION>__{His eyes move this way and that. After a silent beat, he shuts them again. After another silent beat, we hear  muffled, probably from am adjacent room  a brief, dying laugh.

You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay.  The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship.

And the king, Nebuchadnezzar, answered and said to the Chaldeans, I recall not my dream; if ye will not make known unto me my dream, and its interpretation, ye shall be cut in pieces, and of your tents shall be made a dunghill."}

Sunlight burns against the sheers of Barton's window, making it a painfully bright patch in the room which itself remains fairly dim. Barton sits at the secretary, typing furiously. He finishes a page, yanks it out of the carriage, and places it face-down on a short stack of face-down pages. He feeds in a blank sheet and resumes his rapid typing. He is sweating, unshaven, and more haggard even than when we left him the previous night. The telephone rings. After several rings Barton stops typing and answers it, absently, still looking at his work. His voice is hoarse.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{JUMPING BACK}
<ACTION>__{Wide on the hallway. Charlie Meadows has emerged from the elevator and is hellishly backlit by the flame. His suit coat hangs open. His hat is pushed back on his head. From his right hand his briefcase dangles. He stands motionless, facing us. There is something monumental in his posture, shoulders thrown back.}

<DIAL>__{...They say I'm a madman, Barton, but I'm not mad at anyone. Honest I'm not. Most guys I just feel sorry for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to think about what they're going through. How trapped they are. I understand it. I feel for 'em. So I try and help them out...}
<ACTION>__{He reached up to loosen his tie and pop his collar button.}
<CHAR>__{CHARLIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{...Jesus. Yeah. I know what it feels like, when things get all balled up at the head office. It puts you through hell, Barton. So I help people out. I just wish someone would do as much for me...}

<ACTION>__{Wearily:}
<CHAR>__{CHARLIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't be.}
<ACTION>__{He rises to his feet and kneels in front of Barton at the foot of the bed. The two men regard each other. Charlie grabs two bars of the footboard frame, still staring at Barton. His muscles tighten, though nothing moves. His neck fans with effort. All of his muscles tense.  His face is a reddening grimace. With a shriek of protest, the metal gives. The bar to which Barton is handcuffed had come loose at the top and Barton slides the cuff off it, free. Charlie gets to his feet.}
<CHAR>__{CHARLIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm getting off the merry-go-round.}

<ACTION>__{He leaves. Barton rises, picks up Charlie's parcel, and his script.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{THE HALLWAY}
<ACTION>__{As Barton emerges. Flames lick the walls, causing the wallpaper to run with the tack glue sap. Smoke fills the hallway. Barton looks down the hall.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{HIS POV}
<ACTION>__{Charlie stands in front of the door to his room, his briefcase dangling from one hand, his other hand fumbling in his pocket for his key. With his hat pushed back on his head and his shoulders slumped with fatigue, he could be any drummer returning to any hotel after a long hard day on the road. He opens the door and goes into his room.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{BACK TO BARTON}
<ACTION>__{He turns and walks up the hallway, his script in one hand, the parcel in the other. A horrible moaning sound  almost human  can be heard under the roar of the fire.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{BLACKNESS STUDIO HALLWAY}
<ACTION>__{We are tracking laterally across the lobby of an executive building. From offscreen we hear:}

<CHAR>__{BARTON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Or Uncle Dave!}
<ACTION>__{Our track has brought Barton into frame in the foreground, unshaven, unkempt, bellowing into the telephone. In a hallway in the background, a secretary gestures for Barton to hurry up.}
<CHAR>__{OPERATOR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I understand that, sir, but there's still no answer. Shall I check for trouble on the line?}
<ACTION>__{Barton slams down the phone. LIPNIK'S OFFICE Barton enters, still clinging on to Charlie's parcel. Lou Breeze stands in one corner censoriously watching Barton. Lipnik is at the far end of the room, gazing out the window.}

<DIAL>__{Fink.}
<CHAR>__{BARTON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mr. Lipnik.}

<DIAL>__{...Siddown.}
<ACTION>__{Barton takes a seat facing Lipnik's desk.}
<CHAR>__{LIPNIK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{BARTON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Congratulations.}
<CHAR>__{LIPNIK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.}
<CHAR>__{BARTON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes sir, they}
<CHAR>__{LIPNIK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Anyway, I had Lou read your script for me.}
<ACTION>__{He taps distastefully at the script on his desk, which has a slightly charred title page.}
<CHAR>__{LIPNIK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.}
<CHAR>__{BARTON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.}
<CHAR>__{LIPNIK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't gas me, Fink. If you're opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let YOU run the the studio. It doesn't and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run THIS particular asylum. So let's put a stop to THAT rumor right now.}
<ACTION>__{Listlessly:}
<CHAR>__{BARTON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes sir.}
<CHAR>__{LIPNIK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was  well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?}
<CHAR>__{LOU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes, Colonel.}
<CHAR>__{LIPNIK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hell, I could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but I won't insult your intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. They don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul  well, all right, a little bit, for the critics  but you make it the carrot that wags the dog. Too much of it and they head for exits and I don't blame 'em. There's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten Feet Square".}
<CHAR>__{LOU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".}
<CHAR>__{LIPNIK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Look at "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas". These are big movies, Fink. About big men, in tights  both physically and mentally. But especially physically. We don't put Wallace Beery in some fruity movie about suffering  I thought we were together on that.}
<CHAR>__{BARTON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm sorry if I let you down.}
<CHAR>__{LIPNIK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink  you're a goddamn write-off.}
<CHAR>__{BARTON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<ACTION>__{This sets Lipnik off:}
<CHAR>__{LIPNIK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You arrogant sonofabitch!  You think you're the only writer who can give me that Barton Fink feeling?!  I got twenty writers under contract that I can ask for a Finktype thing from. You swell-headed hypocrite!  You just don't get it, do you?  You think the whole world revolves inside whatever rattles inside that little kike head of yours. Get him outta my sight, Lou. Make sure he stays in town, though; he's still under contract. I want you in town, Fink, and outta my sight. Now get lost. There's a war on.}
