<L>__{exterior jackson home same moment}
<A>__{next door to the ripons. fleury knocks. door opens: a sad man with black bags under dying eyes. disgusted resigned breath through a half open mouth. silver watch and polo insignia... sees al ghazi, eyes come alive, teeth grit.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{mr. aaron jackson?}
<C>__{aaron jackson}
<P>__{(re: al ghazi)}
<D>__{get him away from me }
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{ easy, sir. he's a friend to us }
<C>__{aaron jackson}
<D>__{ i don't know either one a' you.}

<D>__{i'm special agent ronald fleury of the fbi. this is colonel al ghazi with the saudi state police }
<C>__{aaron jackson}
<D>__{ the police: they attacked.}
<A>__{al ghazi quietly backs away, walks away. fleury looks after him, turns back to mr. jackson who stares after al ghazi: hate. fleury unsure what to do nexterior}
<C>__{aaron jackson }
<D>__{i just put my boys down for the first time in two days. i can't wake `em and sure as hell can't be gone if they stir on their own.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{can i come back?}
<C>__{aaron jackson}
<P>__{(too loud)}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{your boys...}
<A>__{jackson remembers the warning he just spoke...}
<C>__{ronald fleury }
<D>__{to ask about two nights ago.}
<A>__{fresh tears re animate his face:}
<C>__{aaron jackson}
<D>__{when my wife's jaw was shot off in front of our sons? my sons who sat with her while she bled to death? couldn't speak because she didn't have the bottom of her face and i wasn't home and my baby boys are destroyed for life and my five year old had a box of band aids in his hand when i finally got home?}
<A>__{silence outside of mr. jackson's sobbing. fleury sick to his stomach. desperate to let this man alone. no eye contact.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{...i won't pretend to know...}
<A>__{aaron jackson settles, wipes away tears, appreciates the honesty. then bites back into his rage:}
<C>__{aaron jackson}
<D>__{kill everyone that had something to do with this. everyone related to them. everyone who knew them.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and all you'd be doing is their recruiting for them... it's an entire generation: not small and isolated like they say. but a generation that thinks what they did to my wife, to my children, is a "calling"...}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{up the street, there was a wreck, did you see any }
<C>__{aaron jackson}
<D>__{ notice how it wouldn't take a lot to disguise your friend}
<P>__{(points to al ghazi)}
<D>__{as a mexican? think he couldn't handle crossing our deserts? look around!}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{aaron }
<C>__{aaron jackson}
<P>__{(explodes)}
<D>__{ let me finish god damn you }
<A>__{a child's scream from inside. piercing. scary. jackson goes red, clenched fists, steps to fleury who takes an instinctive step backward, guard up. jackson stops, spins back inside. a door slam that rattles the plywood sheet covering the shattered window. the screams become night terror shrieks.}
