<L>__{int hull of yacht evening}
<A>__{chiron: "11:00 pm. atlantic ocean. 10 hours to go".}
<B>__{pan past piles of evidence boxes full of everything}
<A>__{imaginable: guns, videotapes, drugs, etc...}
<B>__{pan past a pile of explosives wrapped with cable and attached}
<A>__{to a timer, counting down: "1:59, 1:58, 1:57..." pan to milo and cass seated on the floor, tied together, back to back, arms strapped to their sides. pan to the doorway, where bobby stands, inspecting the room.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{ok. guess that's it. gotta go.}
<P>__{(checking them out) you know what?}
<D>__{you guys make a great couple.}
<A>__{bobby exits and cass and milo are alone. suddenly, cass starts giggling.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{what's so funny?}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{my mom was worried i wouldn't have plans for xmas eve.}
<A>__{cass is laughing harder and harder until milo realizes:}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{hey, are you crying?}
<C>__{cass}
<P>__{(sobbing)}
<D>__{no. i'm not...}
<A>__{milo doesn't know what to do. his hands are trapped in front of him, he can't even pat her on the shoulder.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{ok, just don't...}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{i'm not crying.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i know you're not.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{i just...(miserable) i can't believe i going to die by being blown up and sinking to the bottom of the ocean with someone who thinks i'm a total liar.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{we're not gonna die.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{oh yeah? what's the plan?}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{well...}
<A>__{milo looks around. there is a small porthole in one wall. milo assumes a take charge manner:}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{ok. here's what we do. we're going to synchronize our efforts in order to cross the room and manipulate the bomb out of the room and into the water in order to diffuse the explosive impact.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{you mean we're going to throw the bomb out the window?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{uh, yeah. or we can just wait to get blown up.}
<A>__{close on the timer: "1:19, 1:18, 1:17..."}
<C>__{cass}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{i'm with you. go, team, go.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{that's the spirit. ok, first we're going sideways: to the left...}
<A>__{milo leans one way, cass leans the other: they don't move.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{ok. my left this time...}
<A>__{they both lean to the left and topple over. milo is facing the direction of the bomb.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{now we're gonna work our way over to the bomb.}
<A>__{they start moving like a sideways inchworm, creeping along.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{and i don't think you're a total liar, but in my own defense, i was one of the top detectives in my division, i had been working that case for months, and then you just waltzed in and solved it.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{i didn't just "waltz in". you know i had been working it for months, too. isn't it possible that we're both good at our jobs, and i just happened to come out ahead?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(fumbling)}
<D>__{oh. well, i...(blurting out) look, i was confused, i had never been in love before!}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{well, neither had i!}
<A>__{milo seems surprised to hear this. but before he can respond, the boat rocks on a wave and they are sent rolling in cass' direction. as they roll:}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{ow...}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{shit..}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{dammit...}
<A>__{they are stopped when milo's face is slammed into the side of the boat. milo lets out a grunt. beat.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{milo?}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(muffled)}
<D>__{i'm ok. ok, we need to turn to the right, and wait for the next wave.}
<A>__{they both start turning separate ways:}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{my right.}
<A>__{they turn to the right and wait. after a moment:}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{so. you were in love with me?}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{of course i was in love with you, why do you think i married you?}
<A>__{no response. behind her back, milo looks sheepish. cass}
