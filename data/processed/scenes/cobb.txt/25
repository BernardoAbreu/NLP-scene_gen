<L>__{exterior mountain lodge night}
<A>__{stump parks and approaches somewhat warily. the sound of breaking glass and shouting voices. stump hurries to the door to escape the rain and finds refuge under the eave. the noise is frightening from that close. he stands unsurely does he knock? when the door is thrown open a black man, willie, 40, with a suitcase stands wildly upset, screaming back into the house.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{fuck you, mr. cobb, i have too much dignity to spend another moment with you. i hope you die before the sun comes up and may you rot in hell!}
<A>__{the man whirls and is shocked to see stump standing there with his own suitcase.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{i'm a writer.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{you mean he actually found somebody to take the job?}
<A>__{willie bursts out into crazed laughter, as if the world of cobb was finally too absurd. cobb and a writer? in this weather? in any weather? and the man walks through the rain, laughing, heading on foot down off the mountain as stump just stares. stump turns and steps into the open doorway.}
