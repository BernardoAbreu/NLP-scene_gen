<L>__{exterior starbucks day}
<A>__{sitting outside, alex hunches over the table, increasingly anxious. clear listens; expression skeptical.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. i'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. that, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{that's total bullshit. you can find death omens anywhere you want to.}
<A>__{she picks up her paper coffee cup.}
<C>__{clear }
<D>__{hey, look! "coffee" starts with a "c" and ends with an "e." so does the word "choke!" we're going to choke to death! oh no! starbuck was a whaler. we're going to be harpooned!}
<A>__{alex angrily glares at clear. clear drops her tone.}
<C>__{clear }
<D>__{you'll go nuts if you start with that shit.}
<A>__{ms. lewton appears from around the corner. she starts toward the entrance, but pauses, tensing when she sees alex. he cautiously flashes a greeting smile. the teacher, however, averts her eyes and continues into the coffee shop. alex sighs, guiltily. clear sympathizes with both of them.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{she's leaving the school. moving away.}
<A>__{alex studies, appealing to her...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{clear, how do we know that by just sitting here, breathing this air or sipping the coffee, having crossed the street... we haven't started in motion the events that will lead to our death? fifty years from now. ten years. tomorrow.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you don't unless... you're able to open yourself to the signs i'm willing to show you.}
<A>__{he leans foward, removing a peice of paper from his pocket. close alex's hand slides across the table. opening his hand reveals the piece of paper reading, "... tod..." clear's hand enter's frame to take the paper. camera follows as she raises it, her expression obviously puzzled. as she eyes alex for an explanation, camera cranes down quickly to the empty paper cups on the table... ... a slight approaching breeze knocks them over. down the street heading west a somewhat cherry 70's muscle car speeds in the direction of the starbucks. carter horton is driving. terry chaney rides shotgun. carter looks out the window. carter's pov moving alex and clear she holds the paper as alex, apparently, explains the story. carter's car carter scowls, his anger rising as he slows, staring at the perceived reasons for his problems.}
<B>__{alex and clear}
<A>__{her eyes turn from the paper to alex, concerned about him...}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{i don't understand... did you see tod die? did it happen again, like on the plane?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{no, but it might as well be the same thing. this was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. but here... you're suggesting tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active presence.}
<A>__{alex nods, feeling she's understanding.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{the mortician said death has a design. now... if you, me, tod, carter, terry, billy, ms. lewton messed up that design, because, for whatever reason, i was able to see death's plan... then we cheated it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but what if it was our time, what if we were not meant to get off that plane? what if it is still is our time? if... it... is still not finished with us? we will all still die; now, not later.}
<A>__{troubled and deeply concerned, clear studies alex.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{unless... we find the pattern. and cheat it again.}
<A>__{clear sets the paper down, looking sadly at alex.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{after hearing you, just now... i do believe...}
<A>__{alex leans back and sighs, relieved...}
<C>__{clear }
<D>__{...that tod killed himself.}
<A>__{alex is taken aback, hurt and angry.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{then there's no one left who can help me.}
<A>__{carter's car his eyes having never left alex, carter suddenly cranks the wheel hard to the left to make a tight u turn.}
<B>__{billy hitchcock}
<A>__{rides his bike. he reacts, startled by... billy hitchcock's pov carter's car barreling down towards him. the car cuts in front of the bicycle to complete the u turn.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{billy swerves to the left, directly in front of an oncoming car. the car swerves right, as does billy, avoiding a certain fatal collision for the cyclist. the oncoming car honks! carter's car pulls up to the curb. oblivious to the accident he almost caused, carter gets out, strutting toward the tables outside the coffee shop. inside the car, terry sighs...}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{baby, come on... not now.}
<A>__{but her boyfriend continues. she gets out and hustles after him.}
<B>__{alex and clear}
<A>__{their attention drawn by the commotion, clear and alex watch carter horton approach them, followed by terry, who stops, irked, near the curb at the crosswalk.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{carter...}
<A>__{at that moment, ms. lewton exits with an ezpresso drink. sensing trouble, she has no energy or desire to involve herself.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{kind of have a reunion, here.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{let it go!}
<A>__{carter steps before ms. lewton, blocking her exit...}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{when are you moving?}
<C>__{ms. lewton}
<D>__{a couple of weeks.}
<A>__{she can't wait to leave. while trying to walk around carter...}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{we're losing our favorite teacher.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{look, there's something you should all know.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{alex...}
<A>__{carter eyes alex, continuing the taunt. he raises the volume of his words to drown out alex's words and incite conflict.}
<C>__{carter }
<D>__{lived here herwhole life.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{this'll be hard to believe.}
<A>__{ms. lewton's eyes flash to alex, afraid of him.}
<C>__{carter }
<D>__{and now she has to move. all because of browning.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{listen to me, we may all be in danger...}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{shut up! the both of you!}
<A>__{the two boys stop their heated exchange.}
<C>__{terry }
<D>__{they died! we lived!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{get over it! i won't let that plane crash be the most important thing in my life. i'm moving on, carter, and if you're gonna waste your life beating the shit out of alex everytime you see him, then you can just drop fucking dead!}
<A>__{head and shoulders remaining angrily in carter's direction, terry takes a blind step off the curb and into the crosswalk, without a cut... a bus suddenly speeds into frame and, thud! plows directly right into her... alex, clear, carter and ms. lewton are splattered with blood before they can even recoil.}
