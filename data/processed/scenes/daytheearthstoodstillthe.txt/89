<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior hallway barnhardt's house night}
<A>__{as the m.p. captain and klaatu enter the front door, which is held open for then by hilda. she gestures them toward the half open door of barnhardt's study, where barnhardt can be seen puzzling over the problem on the blackboard. the captain knocks on the open door to attract his attention and enters with klaatu.}
<L>__{interior barnhardt's study}
<A>__{barnhardt turns from his deep preoccupation at the blackboard, chalk in hand.}
<C>__{m.p. captain}
<D>__{this is the man you wanted to see, professor.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<P>__{(studying klaatu curiously)}
<D>__{thank you, captain.}
<C>__{m.p. captain}
<D>__{i will wait outside.}
<A>__{he steps out into the hall, closing the door. barnhardt continues to study klaatu for a moment, then points to the notations he made on the blackboard. there is a controlled but anxious excitement in barnhardt's attitude.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<D>__{you wrote this?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(nodding easily)}
<D>__{it was a clumsy way to introduce myself but i understand you're a difficult man to see.}
<P>__{(glancing at the}
<D>__{blackboard}
<P>__{reproachfully)}
<D>__{i thought you'd have the solution by this time.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<D>__{not yet. that's why i wanted to see you.}
<A>__{klaatu glances at the work barnhardt has been doing on the board. then he points to one of the expressions in an equation.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{all you have to do now is substitute this expression }
<P>__{(pointing to a specific place)}
<D>__{ at this pointerior}
<A>__{impressed and interested, barnhardt tugs at his chin as he studies and weighs the results.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<P>__{(slowly, thoughtfully)}
<D>__{yes that will reproduce the first order terms. but what about the effect of the other terms?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{almost negligible... with variation of parameters, this is the answer.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<D>__{how can you be so sure? have you tested this theory?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(with a slight smile)}
<D>__{i find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.}
<P>__{(barnhardt stares at him blankly)}
<D>__{i understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<P>__{as though unsure of what he's heard)}
<D>__{yes yes, i have.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{my name is klaatu.}
<P>__{(noting that}
<D>__{barnhardt's expression is changing from amazement to}
<P>__{incredulity)}
<D>__{i spent two days at your walter reed hospital. room 309. my doctor's name was major white and i had a very attractive nurse called ruth, who's getting married next wednesday.}
<P>__{(klaatu waits for}
<D>__{this to sink in, then speaks with}
<P>__{quiet authority)}
<D>__{if you are not interested or if you intend to turn me over to your army we needn't waste any more time.}
<A>__{barnhardt hesitates for a long, thoughtful moment. then he goes to the door, opens it and speaks to the captain outside.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<P>__{(to the captain, his}
<D>__{voice a little}
<P>__{unsteady)}
<D>__{you can go now, captain. please thank general cutler and tell him tell him that i know this gentleman.}
<A>__{barnhardt closes the door and turns to find klaatu watching him with a faint smile. barnhardt sinks into a chair, trying to adjust his mind.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{you have faith, professor barnhardt}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<D>__{it isn't faith that makes good science, mr. klaatu. its curiosity.}
<P>__{(unable to conceal his interest)}
<D>__{sit down, please. i have several thousand questions to ask you.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(ignoring the invitation)}
<D>__{i would like to explain something of my mission here.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<D>__{that was my first question.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(with some bitterness)}
<D>__{it was my intention to discuss this officially with all the nations of the earth but i was not allowed the opportunity. i have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.}
<P>__{(gathering his thoughts)}
<D>__{we know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. we also know that you are experimenting with rockets.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<D>__{yes that is true.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{in the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. but in the hands of your people }
<P>__{(he shrugs and shakes his head)}
<D>__{we've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{if you mean that you are afraid of us }
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(with cool impressive emphasis)}
<D>__{we want to be sure you don't make let us say an unfortunate mistake. we know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... you see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.}
<P>__{(indicating the telephone)}
<D>__{we discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.}
<P>__{(he paces thoughtfully)}
<D>__{so long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves with your primitive tanks and planes we were unconcerned. but soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. that, of course, we cannot tolerate.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<P>__{(thoughtful and impressed)}
<D>__{these other planets do they have peace and security?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{we had our atomic wars thousands of years ago.}
<P>__{(he smiles wryly)}
<D>__{after that we fought with bows and arrows. then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution that aggression leads to chaos.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<P>__{(with deep conviction)}
<D>__{we scientists understand this. even we primitive scientists.}
<P>__{(straightforwardly)}
<D>__{what exactly is the nature of your mission, mr. klaatu?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{i came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger very grave danger. i am prepared, however, to offer a solution.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<D>__{would you care to be more specific?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(evenly)}
<D>__{what i have to say must be said to all concerned.}
<P>__{(with a suggestion of deference to barnhardt)}
<D>__{it is too important to be entrusted to any individual.}
<A>__{barnhardt is forced reluctantly to accept klaatu's refusal to go any further. after a moment's thought, he speaks seriously, but with a twinkle in his eye.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<D>__{i gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(sternly, as this}
<D>__{unpleasant episode}
<P>__{is recalled)}
<D>__{i come to you as a last resort and i confess that my patience is wearing thin.}
<P>__{(with jovian annoyance)}
<D>__{must i take drastic action in order to get a hearing?}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<P>__{(uneasily)}
<D>__{what what sort of action do you mean?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{violent action since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{leveling the island of manhattan, perhaps or dropping the rock of gibraltar into the sea.}
<A>__{barnhardt stands staring at him for a moment, passes his hand across his brow. then, as klaatu watches, barnhardt paces the floor, trying to digest what he has heard. after a moment, he turns to klaatu.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<D>__{would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists i am calling together?. perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(quietly, evenly)}
<D>__{that's what i came to see you about.}
<A>__{barnhardt flings him a glance, then looks momentarily sheepish. but his own eagerness carries him on. he paces the floor thoughtfully.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<D>__{it is not enough to have men of science. we scientists are too easily ignored or misunderstood. we must get important men from every field. educators philosophers church leaders men of vision and imagination the finest minds in the world.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{i leave that in your hands.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<D>__{you'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{no not at all.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<D>__{what about your personal safety in the meantime? what about the army and the police?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{my name is carpenter and i'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<P>__{(smiling, but a little concerned)}
<D>__{i'm afraid i can't offer you any real protection. i have no influence in cases of inter planetary conspiracy.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{i'm sure i will be quite safe until the meeting.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<P>__{(he suddenly pauses, thoughtfully)}
<D>__{one thing, mr. klaatu. suppose this group should reject your proposals. what is the alternative?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(with a sense of quiet, inescapable power)}
<D>__{i'm afraid you have no alternative. in such, a case the planet earth would have to be }
<P>__{(he looks for the right word)}
<D>__{ eliminated.}
<A>__{the implications of this statement leave barnhardt speechless, his keen mind reeling.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<D>__{such power exists?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{i assure you such power exists.}
<A>__{barnhardt stands silent for a moment, trying to collect his shattered thoughts. klaatu watches him as he starts pacing again.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<D>__{the people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. they must understand what is at stake.}
<P>__{(after a thoughtful moment, he looks up)}
<D>__{you mentioned a demonstration of force }
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<D>__{would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{yes of course.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<D>__{something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. something that would affect the entire planet.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(with a nod)}
<D>__{that can easily be arranged.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<P>__{(frightened by his}
<D>__{easy assumption of}
<P>__{infinite power)}
<D>__{i wouldn't want you to harm anybody or destroy anything.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(easily)}
<D>__{why don't you leave it to me? i will think of something.}
<C>__{barnhardt}
<P>__{(with a nervous half smile)}
<D>__{maybe a little demonstration.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(thinking about it)}
<D>__{something dramatic but not destructive.}
<P>__{(intellectually amused)}
<D>__{it's quite an interesting problem.}
<P>__{(barnhardt nods vaguely)}
<D>__{would day after tomorrow be all right? say about noon?}
<A>__{klaatu's bland manner leaves barnhardt shaken, almost wishing he'd never started this business.}
