<A>__{a tiny room overlooking the dance floor. crammed with electronic gear, at the center of which is tex arcana, whipping from one deck to another, hands flying. he's in a wheelchair, which pivots nimbly, managing to high five lenny as he walks in.}

<D>__{present. something i had made. let me know what you think.}
<C>__{tex}
<D>__{hey, alright. got something here for you, too.}
<P>__{(passes him an envelope)}
<D>__{it just showed up tonight, don't know who left it.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{fan mail from some flounder?}
<A>__{lenny looks at the envelope, which has "nero" hand printed in block letters. tex takes a pull from a flask as he takes a squid deck out of a drawer and sticks the tape in. he puts on the headset and pushes play. in pov we are on a beach. early morning. we are running flat out, with the wind. looking down... we are barefoot on the wet sand. foaming water races up the sand and breaks around our strong male legs. looking up again, to see our running companion... a beautiful lithe woman in shorts and t shirt. she laughs and we speed up. an exquisite moment of pure life force. tight on tex's face... as a tear leaks from the corner of his eye. he is smiling like he is listening to beautiful music. we see the quiet magnificence of lenny's gift. tex opens his eyes. looks for lenny to say thanks: but lenny's gone. not a guy to hang around for thanks yous.}
