<C>__{glenn}
<D>__{you're gonna bust me for picking up a car?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{for the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.}

<C>__{karen}
<D>__{ripley? you mean the wall street guy?}
<C>__{glenn}

<C>__{karen}
<D>__{if i didn't know you, glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead. look at it that way. go on.}
