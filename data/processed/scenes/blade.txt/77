<T>__{fade in :}
<A>__{on dragonetti, his face covered with a black condemned man's hood frost stands before him, grinning like the cheshire cat. he's dressed from head to toe in a black motorcycle suit boots, gloves, a visored helmet tucked under one arm. mercury and quinn are standing nearby, similarly attired. we're on a stretch of rocky coastline, tucked away in a secluded cove. dragonetti has been stripped bare, chained like prometheus to an ancient standing stone.}
<C>__{dragonetti}
<P>__{(straining)}
<D>__{what is this? where am i?!}
<A>__{frost steps forward, pulling dragonetti's hood off. dragonetti stares at his surroundings, horrified.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{when was the last time you stopped to appreciate a sunrise, dragonetti? three, four hundred years?}
<A>__{frost checks his watch, then looks to the ocean. on the horizon, a sliver of gold appears.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{how do you like that? right on time.}
<C>__{dragonetti}
<P>__{(snarling)}
<D>__{the other elders will never let you get away with this!}
<A>__{just then, the twelve vampire elders emerge behind frost, forming a circle around dragonetti. all wear business suits, gloves, along with high tech "sun masks" to protect their faces from the light's lethal rays. they stare at dragonetti like a silent jury. his face darkens, anger rising but there's a desperation in his eyes now too. he speaks in the secret tongue:}
<C>__{dragonetti}
<P>__{(subtitled)}
<D>__{don't you see, you fools?! he'll betray you too! he's planning on invoking lamagra himself!}
<A>__{the vampires just smile and shake their heads.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{the wheel turns, old fang. guess you just got a little too long in the tooth.}
<A>__{dragonetti's cries are cut short as frost forces the aging vampire's mouth open, ripping out his fangs with his bare hands. dragonetti gurgles and shrieks, sounding like a dying animal. frost turns to face the twelve now, his eyes bright with victory. he pulls on his motorcycle helmet, as do mercury and quinn. behind them, dragonetti struggles furiously against his chains to no avail as the first faint rays of daylight fall upon him, channeled inward by the natural formation of the cove dragonetti howls, his skin beginning sizzle and smoke. then he catches fire like paper beneath a magnifying glass. he thrashes about as his flesh starts to run from his body.}
<B>__{the vampire elders}
<A>__{watch, impassive, protected by their masks when suddenly, twelve figures rise up behind them, clad in bike helmets and black leather, just like frost. the intruders grip each of the elders in a strangle hold, ripping their masks off.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{dragonetti was right. you were fools to trust me.}
<A>__{frost flips down the visor of his helmet even as }
<B>__{the red sun}
<A>__{rises in all its fiery glory. one by one, the vampire elder's heads catch fire, skullflesh sizzling away burning down the line of them in successively building intensity until all twelve explode in a conflagration of blinding}
<B>__{white light.}
<A>__{frost and his compatriots are blown off their feet by the sheer intensity of the occult blast a blast which sends the skeletal bodies of the elders slamming into the rock wall. when it's over, frost picks himself back up. we see that the only thing left of dragonetti and the others are }
<B>__{thirteen shadow silhouettes}
<A>__{permanently etched onto the rock's surface, just like the bombing victims of hiroshima.}
