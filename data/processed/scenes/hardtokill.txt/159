<A>__{we are not sure where we are yet. in the distance, we see a procession of marching men, all wearing kilts, and all the accoutrements of traditional scottish garb. in the front, several paces ahead of the neatly marching lines of men, is a single bagpiper. behind all of them is a hearse, being nobly escorted by mounted police.}

<A>__{now we see them fully: the colors, the feeling, the emotion of caring men marching in the funeral parade of a fallen comrade. camera pan's over to reveal a section of mourners mostly police but with some civilians. the camera moves closer and pans to the front row, where we see storm in full police regalia, a medal of valor around his neck. andy and sonny are standing near at sober attention. the procession stops and the lone bagpiper continues to play the dirge as he walks up and takes his position on a section of lawn. the pallbearers remove the flag from the casket and present it to the chief of police, who now slowly approaches the group of mourners and stops directly in front of sonny storm. he presents the flag and salutes sonny. the lone bagpiper stops and an officer on trumpet begins playing "taps." the coffin is slowly lowered. full screen tv monitor finally: the film that storm shot that night seven years ago on the wharf. spliced with the audiotape with subtitles including each speaker's name to make every word and identity clear. we see: the two shadow men step from the station wagon. the "pushed" film clearly reveals them to be trent and holland. we see them conspire with calabrese and vitale.}
