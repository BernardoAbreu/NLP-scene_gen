<A>__{a grey, dingy, cell block style room â€” now crammed with elle's clothes, the pink fluffy love seat and potted palm, along with an elliptical cross trainer, pink flamingo party lights and a neon pink margarita glass sculpture. elle tries to shove a large law textbook into her tiny prada backpack to no avail. she gives up and tosses the book onto the bed where underdog leaps away to miss being squished.}
