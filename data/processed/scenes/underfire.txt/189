<A>__{p.o.v. several tanquettas and earth movers coming over the hill in the distance. the refugees look up fearfully and some hide. as the war machinery gets closer, we see that: sandinistas are driving the machines draped with red and black (f.s.l.n.), blue and white (nicaraguan), and yellow and white (the vatican) flags. graffiti of victory covers the tanquettas. people come into the street cheering, embracing, only gradually realizing what has happened.}
