<L>__{interior bedroom bathroom night}
<A>__{helen walks harry to the edge of the bed and sits him down. she puts her hand on his chest and pushes, causing him to lie back.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{don't move. i will be right back.}
<A>__{she turns on the stereo. a kenny g disc she put in there earlier. soft tenor sax flows around the room. helen enters the bathroom and shuts the door partway. she opens a cupboard and quickly pulls out some things she hid there earlier. a bottle of champagne on ice. two glasses. some trashy lingerie.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i will just be a second. so what happened tonight at the office?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i couldn't believe it. i go back to get this report i need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead i answer it }
<A>__{helen is hurrying to put on the unfamiliar lingerie. g string panties and low cut bra. she holds up the garter belt, turning it backward and forward, trying to figure out which way it goes. on harry, yawning. lying with the ease of years of practice.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it's the big client in japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown }
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(keeping him talking)}
<D>__{what'd you do, honey?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well i pull out the manual on their setup, which is the new 680 server...}
<A>__{helen is pulling up the black stockings. she fastens the garters to the tops. her features are a scowl of concentration. she is very earnest in her preparations.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{...and i'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable... really wild.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(putting on black pumps)}
<D>__{it sounds wild. so now you're a big hero, right? for fixing their system.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(faintly)}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{my husband the hero.}
<A>__{red lipstick. then she puts a little perfume on her wrists.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i will be right there, honey. just a minute.}
<A>__{harry doesn't answer. helen puts a little perfume down the front of her panties.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{just a second.}
<A>__{helen quickly pours two glasses of champagne. then she slinks around the doorframe, making her entrance. she looks like a living 900 number. helen stands before the bed, looking down, holding the champagne glasses. on harry: sprawled on the bed, fully clothed, snoring softly. a little bit of drool is coming out the side of his mouth. hold on helen, all dressed up with no place to go. she gazes down at him, her shoulders slumping.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{happy birthday, harry.}
<A>__{she sighs deeply and downs her champagne in one long gulp.}
