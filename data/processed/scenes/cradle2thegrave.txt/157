<L>__{interior hangar}
<A>__{in here, the hangar door continues to open as the tank makes its slow approach. archie's not a great driver. tommy sweeps the muzzle of the machine gun across the group.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{just be cool!}
<A>__{at which point, russell breaks for his five ton truck.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{i said don't move, motherfucker!}
<A>__{russell just keeps going. slides open the side door in the back of the five ton, revealing... a twin fifty machine gun. two barrels, .50 caliber. dangerous even for a tank. russell vaults in and takes aim.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{fucking amateurs!}
<A>__{he starts firing. people start running. .50 cal. rounds take big chunks out of whatever they hit.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{shit! what do we do?}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{shoot back!}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{how?}
<A>__{the question's answered for him. he somehow does the right thing. and... tommy's machine gun begins ripping chunks out of the five ton and everything near it. tommy's a horrible shot; the gun's more in control of him. but... russell finally dies under a hail of heavy lead.}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{twin .50's some major firepower. how'd that little shit get one?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{motherfucker. couldn't fucking listen.}
