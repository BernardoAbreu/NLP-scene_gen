<L>__{interior boulder diamond exchange night}
<A>__{the three girls stand at the end of a large hallway. at the other end is a glass case, full of diamonds. sissy pulls and aerosol can from her utility belt and sprays the air in the hallway. she watches the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly at the sound of the spray. suddenly, within the mist, laser beams become apparent. sissy hands the decibel monitor to chrissy and takes a few steps back, shaking her hands to limber up. she then runs forward and does an impressive series of flips down the hallway, not touching a single laser beam. chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly. once sissy's flipping comes to a stop at the other end of the hallway near the diamond case, she makes a hand gesture to justice. justice nods, and proceeds to do the same series of flips down the hallway, not tripping the alarm. chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly. justice lands beside sissy, and then sissy gestures to chrissy. chrissy tosses the decibel monitor over the laser beams, sissy catches it, and the monitor rises only slightly. then, chrissy proceeds with her series of flips, which are even more impressive than the other two, including running up walls and pushing into handstand flips. when she passes the last laser beam, she lands between sissy and justice, arms in the air like a gymnast. then, she lets out a loud, manly fart. the decibel monitor goes red and an alarm starts ringing through the building.}
