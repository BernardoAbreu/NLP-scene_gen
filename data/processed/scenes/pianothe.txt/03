<A>__{two of the men are black, all are battered, tattooed and tough, some are drunk. behind the woman is her daughter, a girl of ten in scottish dress. she too is carried on the shoulders of seamen. ada is placed on the sand. she looks down at her feet sinking into the wet sand, then up at the huge confusion of fern and bush in front of her. the sound of sea behind is thunderous. several of the seamen have formed a group and are pissing on the sand. her daughter is on all fours evidently being sick. but ada's attention is diverted to the seamen who are staggering through the waves with a huge piano shaped box. they put it down as soon as they get to 5hore but ada makes gestures that they must immediately bring it to higher safer ground. the piano placed to her satisfaction she hovers near it, one hand in constant touch of it while her daughter grips her free hand. sc 10 exterior beach day sc 10 two seamen finish carrying the last crate to shore. trunks and boxes including an open crate with hens are scattered carelessly along the shore. the seamen gather together. after a discussion in which they look between ada and her child and their coaster out on the sea, one of the men approaches. behind him the other men keep their eyes out to sea or down on the sand. they don't want to be involved. the sight of the women alone on this beach is too hopeless.}
