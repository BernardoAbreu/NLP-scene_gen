<L>__{interior a posh party in the hills night}
<A>__{the party is chock full of trophy wives and their decidedly less attractive husbands. diane is in a full blown booze and ritalin induced monologue, having cornered two women.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{my god, let me tell you, breaking my hand on that bitch's face...}
<A>__{the two women recoil.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{...was the best thing that ever happened to me.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{phase three: rambling incoherent monologues in public.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{i feel fantastic, just fabulous. i mean, i feel like i could run a marathon like that bruce jenner guy. he did that, right? boy, i will tell you before he had that face lift that made him look like a drag queen, i would've let him stick his javelin in me any day.}
<A>__{suddenly, her ears unconsciously pick up the strands of a conversation going on behind them between two husbands.}
<D>__{husband #1 so i looked each and every juror in the eye }
<C>__{diane}
<P>__{(spinning around)}
<D>__{i want to talk to you about juries, will you come and talk to me about juries? husband #1 uh...}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{i'd like to be on a jury and say "guilty!" or "sidebar!" what do you think goes on in all the sequestered situations? do you think any of the jurors have sex with each other? i was once on an episode of love boat, playing the role of "bikini girl" and my line was "i will have another," it was with "isaac" at the pool bar. i had to suck one of the associate producers off to get the line, but it got me my sag card, so i guess it was worth it.}
<B>__{t}
<A>__{he men shoot each other an uncomfortable glance.}
<D>__{husband #2 uh, i think i could use a refill. husband #1 me too,}
<P>__{(to diane)}
<D>__{please, excuse us.}
<A>__{they head towards the bar and diane follows. the two women she turned away from shake their heads at the spectacle.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{but, but we were talking about juries and isaac and, and that drag queen i broke my face on and..}
<A>__{the two men try to ignore her, but she keeps following them. she finally realizes they aren't stopping. she grabs the first man by the shoulder, pissed.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{hey! cockbreath!}
<A>__{the party stops. everyone is staring at diane as the music continues to play. she looks around the room at the disapproving eyes, panic setting in.}
