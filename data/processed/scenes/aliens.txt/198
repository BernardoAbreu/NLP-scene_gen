<A>__{newt scurries like a rabbit as the looming figure of the alien appears above, seen through the bars. a section of grille is ripped away behind her. she scrambles desperately. another section is ripped away right at her heels. light pouring in. the next will be right above her.}

<A>__{the queen spins at the sound of door motors behind her. the parting doors reveal an inhuman silhouette standing there. ripley steps out, wearing two tons of hardened steel. the power loader. like medieval armor with the power of a bulldozer. she takes a step...the massive foot crash clangs to the deck. she takes another, advancing. ripley's expression is one you hope you'll never see... hell hath no fury like that of a mother protecting her child and that primal, murderous rage surges through her now, banishing all fear.}

<D>__{get away from her, you bitch!}
<A>__{the queen screeches pure lethality and leaps. wallop! a roundhouse from one great hydraulic arm catches it on its hideous skull and slams it into a wall. it rebounds into a massive backhand. crash! it goes backward into heavy loading equipment.}

<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{the queen emerges as a blur of rage, lashing with unbelievable fury. the battle is joined. claws swipe, tail lashes. ripley parries with radical swipes of the steel forks. they circle in a whirling blur, demolishing everything in their path. the cavernous chamber echoes with nightmarish sounds...whine, crash, clang, screech. they lock in a death embrace. ripley closes the forks, crushing two of the creature's limbs. it lashes and writhes with incredible fury, coming within inches of her exposed body. she lifts it off the ground. the hind legs rip at her, slamming against the safety cage, denting it in. the striking teeth extend almost a meter from inside its fanged maw, shooting between the crash bars. she ducks and the teeth slam into the seat cushion behind her dead in a spray of drool. yellow acid foams down the hydraulic arms toward her. the creature rips at high pressure hoses. purple hydraulic fluid sprays ...machine blood mixing with alien blood. they topple, off balance. the queen pins her. ripley hits a switch. the power loader's cutting torch flares on, directly in the thing's face. they roll together, over the lip of a rectangular pit, a vertical loading airlock.}
