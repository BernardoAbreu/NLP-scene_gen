<A>__{the windows of the pick up are now badly fogged, obscuring the guard's view. he licks his lips, deciding to investigate closer. the guard unlocks the front door and starts toward stormie and erwin. they spot him coming and break their embrace. in another moment, the pick up is peeling out of the parking lot. the guard watches the truck go, shakes his head, and goes back inside to start his rounds. up the street, parked with the lights off in the night shade of a large tree, stormie and erwin watch as the guard starts down the glass enclosed hallway towards the morgue.}
