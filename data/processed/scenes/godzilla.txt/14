<A>__{as the van disappears down the road, we crane up revealing a city sign reading: chernobyl, russia.}
<L>__{exterior chernobyl dirt park rain day}
<A>__{with the infamously crippled nuclear power plant in the distance, the utility van slides to a muddy stop by this field of dirt. nick hops out quickly and rushes to the back of the van. he opens the back of the van and grabs several metallic cases. walking a few yards away from the van, he dumps the cases on the ground, opening them to reveal an assortment of sophisticated scientific equipment. taped to the inside are several photos of a girl we'll meet later. some of the photos are of her looking young and beautiful. others are of the two of them happily together. with a switch he turns on the equipment which comes to life. inside one of the cases are several cables attached to long spikes. he grabs them and dashes away.}

<A>__{he attaches the cables to the battery and they spark! nick yelps and jumps back. shaking off the shock, he rushes back over to the mud pit, dropping down to his knees. suddenly, raising from the mud we see dozens of earthworms. excitedly tatopoulos grabs a big empty glass jar and begins filling the jar with worms, happily in his element.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{..."i'm singin' in the mud, just scooping up my worms..."}
<A>__{unable to hear over his walkman, he is oblivious as an enormous russian military helicopter lands right behind him. from the intense wind kicked up by the helicopter, tatopoulos finally turns in time to see several russian officers coming toward him. nick scrambles to his feet.}
