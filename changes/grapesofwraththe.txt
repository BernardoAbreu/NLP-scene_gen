<DIAL>__{"THE GRAPES OF WRATH" Screenplay by Nunnally Johnson Based on the Novel "The Grapes Of Wrath" By John Steinbeck}
<ACTION>__{AN OKLAHOMA PAVED HIGHWAY in daylight. At some distance, hoofing down the highway, comes Tom Joad. He wears a new stiff suit of clothes, ill-fitting, and a stiff new cap, which he gradually manages to break down into something comfortable. He comes down the left side of the road, the better to watch the cars that pass him. As he approaches, the scene changes to a roadside short-order RESTAURANT on the right side of the road. From it comes the sound of a phonograph playing a 1939 popular song. In front of the eatery is a huge Diesel truck labeled: OKLAHOMA CITY TRANSPORT COMPANY. The driver, a heavy man with army breeches and high- laced boots, comes out of the restaurant, the screen door slamming behind him. He is chewing on a toothpick. A waitress appears at the door, behind the screen.}

<DIAL>__{When you be back?}
<CHAR>__{DRIVER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Couple a weeks. Don't do nothin' you wouldn't want me to hear about!}
<ACTION>__{We see him climbing into the cab of the truck from the right side. Getting behind the wheel, he is releasing the handbrake when Tom appears at the driver's seat window.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How about a lift, mister?}
<CHAR>__{DRIVER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Can't you see that sticker?}
<ACTION>__{He indicates a "No Riders" sticker on the windshield.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sure I see it. But a good guy don't pay no attention to what some heel makes him stick on his truck.}
<ACTION>__{After a moment of hesitation the driver releases the brake.}
<CHAR>__{DRIVER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Scrunch down on the running board till we get around the bend.}
<ACTION>__{As Tom scrunches down on the running board the driver throws the truck into gear and it moves. The scene dissolves to the CAB OF THE TRUCK. It is day, and Tom is seated beside the driver, who is surreptitiously eyeing him, trying to confirm some suspicion--an inspection which Tom ignores at first.}
<CHAR>__{DRIVER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Goin' far?}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(shaking his head)}
<DIAL>__{Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.}
<CHAR>__{DRIVER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Lookin' for a job?}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.}
<CHAR>__{DRIVER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(after a curious glance)}
<DIAL>__{Oh!}
<ACTION>__{Cautiously, the driver's eyes drop to Tom's feet. We see TOM'S SHOES. They are prison shoes--new, stiff and bulky. Curiosity is in the eyes of the DRIVER as they shoot a swift glance at Tom. TOM is looking straight ahead, with the dead- pan look that prisoners get when they are trying to conceal something. The DRIVER'S eyes take in Tom's hands and the stiff coat.}
<CHAR>__{DRIVER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Been doin' a job?}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah.}
<CHAR>__{DRIVER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(After a pause)}
<DIAL>__{Got a trade?}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(evenly)}
<DIAL>__{Why don't you get to it, buddy?}
<CHAR>__{DRIVER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(uneasily)}
<DIAL>__{Get to what?}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?}
<CHAR>__{DRIVER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Naw--not much!}
<CHAR>__{DRIVER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a little frightened)}
<DIAL>__{I stay in my own yard.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(without emotion)}
<DIAL>__{Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?}
<CHAR>__{DRIVER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You ain't got to get sore.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(coldly)}
<DIAL>__{Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.}
<CHAR>__{DRIVER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I didn't mean nothing.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(After a pause)}
<DIAL>__{See that road up ahead?}
<CHAR>__{DRIVER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's where I get off.}
<ACTION>__{With a sigh of relief the driver puts his foot on the brake. The TRUCK stops and Tom gets out. He look at the uneasy driver contemptuously.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're about to bust to know what I done, ain't you?  Well, I ain't a guy to let you down.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(Confidentially)}
<DIAL>__{Homicide!}
<ACTION>__{The driver throws the truck into gear. He doesn't like this at all.}
<CHAR>__{DRIVER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I never asked you!}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(as the truck moves away)}
<DIAL>__{Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I hadn't tol' you.}
<ACTION>__{He looks indifferently after the truck and then starts on foot down the dirt crossroad. A wind has begun to blow. The scene dissolves to the roadside under a WILLOW TREE in daylight. The wind is still blowing. Sitting on the ground, his back against the tree, Casy, a long, lean man in overalls, blue shirt, and one sneaker, is fixing something on the other dirty sneaker. To the tune of "Yes, Sir, That's My Baby" he is absent-mindedly singing.}
<CHAR>__{CASY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mmmmm he's my saviour. Mmmmm my saviour, Mmmmmmmmmm my saviour now.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(Looking up as Tom comes down the road)}
<DIAL>__{Howdy, friend.}
<ACTION>__{Carrying his coat under his arm, TOM wipes his face with his cap as he cuts off the road to acknowledge the greeting.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Howdy.}
<ACTION>__{He stops, grateful for the momentary relief of the shade.}
<CHAR>__{CASY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(surprised)}
<DIAL>__{Yeah. On my way home now.}
<CHAR>__{CASY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, I do declare!}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(Grinning)}
<DIAL>__{I baptized you, son.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(staring)}
<DIAL>__{Why, you're the preacher!}
<CHAR>__{CASY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(Reminiscently)}
<DIAL>__{But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(Sighing)}
<DIAL>__{But not no more. I lost the sperit.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(with a grin)}
<DIAL>__{Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.}
<CHAR>__{CASY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.}
<CHAR>__{CASY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(shakes his head sadly)}
<DIAL>__{At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I never let one go by me when I could catch her.}
<CHAR>__{CASY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(Fervently)}
<DIAL>__{I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(after a moment,}
<DIAL>__{figuring there is no percentage in continuing this philosophical discussion, pulls out a flask, which}
<DIAL_PAR>__{he extends)}
<DIAL>__{Have a little snort?}
<CHAR>__{CASY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(holding the flask)}
<DIAL>__{Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(shaking his head)}
<DIAL>__{--but my heart ain't in it.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(He takes a long pull)}
<DIAL>__{Nice drinkin' liquor.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.}
<CHAR>__{CASY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(handing back the flask)}
<DIAL>__{Been out travelin' around?}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.}
<CHAR>__{CASY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, I never. What?}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I been in the penitentiary for four years.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(He drinks)}
<CHAR>__{CASY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Excuse me for asking.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.}
<CHAR>__{CASY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And you ain't ashamed?}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(shaking his head)}
<DIAL>__{He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.}
<CHAR>__{CASY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ain't you seen your folks since then?}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(putting on his coat)}
<DIAL>__{No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?}
<CHAR>__{CASY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(putting on his sneaker)}
<DIAL>__{It don't matter. Ever since I lost the sperit it looks like I just as soon go one way as the other.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(Rising)}
<DIAL>__{I'll go your way.}
<ACTION>__{They pause at the edge of the shade, squint up at the sky, and then move off. The scene dissolves to the SURFACE OF A DIRT ROAD by daylight. Leaves are scuttling across it. The top soil begins to fly up. It is not a hard wind as yet, but it is steady and persistent. Tom's and Casy's feet walk into sight.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.}
<CHAR>__{CASY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(worriedly)}
<DIAL>__{Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!}
<CHAR>__{CASY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.}
<ACTION>__{Tom, holding his cap on his head with his hand, looks up... The TOPS OF THE TREES are bending before the wind. TOM AND CASY continue walking.}
<CHAR>__{CASY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Is it fur?}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(still looking back)}
<DIAL>__{Just around that next bend.}
<ACTION>__{TOM AND CASY are almost being blown along and dust is rising from the road.}
<CHAR>__{CASY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(lifting his voice above the wind)}
<DIAL>__{Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(pointing ahead)}
<DIAL>__{That's our place.}
<ACTION>__{The JOAD CABIN is an ancient, bleak, sway-backed building. There is neither sign of life or habitation about it.}
<CHAR>__{CASY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(looking back)}
<DIAL>__{And it ain't any too close, either! We better run!}
<ACTION>__{A DUST STORM, like a black wall, rises into the sky, moving forward. TOM AND CASY are running, but looking back over their shoulders as the DUST STORM nears. Dust rises from the ground to join and thicken the black wall. TOM AND CASY are seen racing down the road to the cabin, the wind whipping up the dust. The two men smack open the door and slam it shut after them. The screen begins to grow dark as the storm sweeps over the land. It becomes black. In THE CABIN, it is black too, but the sound is different. In addition to the sound of the wind there is the soft hissing of sand against the house.}
<CHAR>__{TOM'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ma?... Pa?... Ain't nobody here?}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(After a long silence)}
<DIAL>__{Somepin's happened.}
<CHAR>__{CASY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You got a match?}
<CHAR>__{TOM'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There was some pieces of candle always on a shelf.}
<ACTION>__{Presently, after shuffling about, he has found them and lights one. He holds it up, lighting the room. A couple of wooden boxes are on the floor, a few miserable discarded things, and that's all. Tom's eyes are bewildered.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{They're all gone--or dead.}
<CHAR>__{CASY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{They never wrote you nothing?}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No. They wasn't people to write.}
<ACTION>__{From the floor he picks up a woman's high button shoe, curled up at the toe and broken over the instep.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This was Ma's. Had 'em for years.}
<ACTION>__{Dropping the shoe, he picks up a battered felt hat.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(To Casy)}
<DIAL>__{You reckon they could be dead?}
<CHAR>__{CASY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I never heard nothin' about it.}
<ACTION>__{Dropping the hat, he moves with the candle toward the door to the back, the only other room of the cabin. He stands in the doorway, holding the candle high. In the BACK ROOM the scene moves from Tom at the door across the room to the shadows, where a skinny little man sits motionless, wide-eyed, staring at Tom. His name is Muley.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(irritated)}
<DIAL>__{I know that! But *where* they gone?}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(To Muley)}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(hastily)}
<DIAL>__{--over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(bewildered)}

<CHAR>__{MULEY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The way it happens--the way it happened to me--the man come one day...}
<ACTION>__{The scene dissolves to MULEY'S DOORYARD. It is a soft spring day, with the peaceful sounds of the country. Seated in a three-year-old touring car is THE MAN, a city man with a collar and tie. He hates to do what he is doing and this makes him gruff and curt, to hide his misgivings. Squatted beside the car are Muley, his son-in-law, and a half-grown son. At a respectful distance stand Muley's wife, his daughter, with a baby in her arms, and a small barefooted girl, watching worriedly. The men soberly trace marks on the ground with small sticks. A hound dog sniffs at the automobile wheels.}

<DIAL>__{Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.}

<ACTION>__{The scene dissolves to a MONTAGE OF TRACTORS: tractors looming over hillocks, flattening fences, through gullies, their drivers looking like robots, with goggles, dust masks over mouth and nose--one after the other, crossing and recrossing as if to convey the impression that this was an invasion of machine-men from some other world.}

<ACTION>__{The scene dissolves to MULEY'S FARM. We see the backs of Muley and the two younger men standing shoulder to shoulder watching a lumbering tractor headed straight toward them.

Her eyes are soft and thoughtful as each item brings a memory, but not sad. Occasionally she smiles faintly. She pulls out a letter, looks at it, starts to throw it into the fire, then puts it back in the box. Her hand pulls out a PICTURE POSTCARD. We see it in Ma's hand. It is a picture of the Statue Of Liberty. Over it: "Greetings from New York City." She turns it over. It is addressed: "Mrs. Joad RFD 254 Oklahomy Territory." In the space for a message: "Hello honey. Willy Mae." MA, after a moment of studying it, throws the card into the fire. She lifts the letter again, puts it back. She pulls out a worn NEWSPAPER CLIPPING. We see it in Ma's hand. The headline is: "JOAD GETS SEVEN YEARS." MA drops the clipping into the fire. Rummaging around, she pulls out a small CHINA DOG. We see it closely as before. On it is printed: "Souvenir of Louisiana Purchase Exposition-- St. Louis--1904." MA studies the dog, smiling, remembering something that it meant in her life.

In the dark, outside the circle of light from the gasoline lantern on the porch, some of the women and children sit and enjoy the luxury of this relative gaiety. The proprietor sits tipped back in a straight chair on the porch. We see the JOAD TENT. Behind their truck, a tarpaulin is stretched over a rope from tree to tree.

<CHAR>__{CARETAKER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, I don't know what you gonna do about it, because I don't hear no riot an' I don't see no riot, an' what's more I don't believe they *is* no riot.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(Waving toward the dance floor)}
<DIAL>__{Look for yourself.}
<ACTION>__{As the deputies, puzzled and uncertain, look toward the DANCE FLOOR, we see the music, the dancing, the gaiety continuing as if nothing had happened. WITHIN THE JOAD TENT at night, several hours later: the tent is black, Tom strikes a match. From a piece of wood on the ground or floor he selects one from several cigarette butts and lights it. While he is doing so, he lifts his head suddenly, and listens. In the CAMP STREET we catch sight of legs walking, the ground lighted from a flashlight. Two pairs of the legs wear state policemen's leather leggings. The third pair are the caretaker's. They stop behind a car. The flashlight plays on the license plate. One of the state cops leans down to copy the license number in a booklet. Then they move on. TOM has lifted the edge of the tent a trifle, enough to see out by flattening his head on the floor. The LEGS are now seen at the Joad jalopy. The light is on the license plate. The cop leans over and copies the number. They move on. TOM, lowering the edge of the tent, sits up. Quietly he pushes aside the piece of carpet that covers him. He is wearing his clothes. We see the policeman's CAR at the caretaker's hut. The two policemen get into the car.}

<ACTION>__{The car drives off, leaving the caretaker looking somberly after it. WITHIN THE JOAD TENT, his cap on, fully dressed for travel, Tom is tieing the ends of the carpet into a shoulder bundle. Rising, he slings it across his shoulder. As he tiptoes toward the door:}
<CHAR>__{MA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ain't you gonna tell me goodbye, Tommy?}
<ACTION>__{For a moment he looks into the darkness in her direction.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Come outside.}
<ACTION>__{They go out. Tom leads Ma around BEHIND THE TENT, to a SECTION OF WIRE FENCE. There is a bench there. Tom leads Ma to it and sits her down. He sits beside her.}

<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(Worriedly)}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(laughing uneasily)}
<DIAL>__{Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...}

<DIAL>__{Then what, Tom?}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.}

His lips form the words: "Good-by, Ma." Then he strides away into the darkness. The scene fades out. The JOAD TRUCK fades in. It stands loaded in front on the Joad tent while Al, Pa, Uncle John, Ma, and the little fellas pile in the last article in a fury of excitement. Beyond, in the background, another jalopy is being prepared for travel with the same feverish haste. It is day.}

As the truck moves away along the road, all three and beaming and waving. Further along the truck passes a sign on the side of the road. It says NO HELP WANTED. The scene fades out.}
