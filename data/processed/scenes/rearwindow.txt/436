<A>__{thorwald has finally reached jeff, knocking the flash equipment out of his hands and coming to grips with him. it is apparent that he is trying to pull jeff out of the wheelchair. jeff fights him off. the wheelchair crashes over, spilling jeff to the floor. thorwald is on top of him, lifting, dragging him to the window. jeff grabs everything he can to keep himself away from the window, but thorwald is far too powerful for him. he strains to raise jeff to the windowsill.}
