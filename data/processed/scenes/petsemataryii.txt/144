<A>__{is standing in the center of the burial ground. he's humming, mimicking renee's feminine tone. now he stops and slowly turns, regarding geoff with dead eyes. he's holding a pickaxe and shovel at his side. gus looks to the ground at his side. geoff follows his gaze... a vision of renee's grave appears headstone. manicured grass. thriving flowers. as if it had been uprooted from her resting place at pleasantville and set down right in the middle of the micmac ground. and now, the vision of renee's grave fades away. in its place is a bundle of white: renee's shrouded body. gus raises the pickaxe, offering it to geoff.}
