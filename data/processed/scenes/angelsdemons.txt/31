<A>__{on the ground now and behind vatican walls, langdon and vincenzo walk briskly around a corner and are met by ernesto olivetti, a solidly built man in his late thirties.}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{professor langdon, welcome to vatican city. ernesto olivetti, inspector generale of the vatican police force.}
<A>__{he takes langdon by the arm and gestures down a narrow passageway.}

<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{i assumed you were swiss guard.}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{no. the gendarmerie is responsible for everything inside the vatican walls, with the exception of the security of his holiness and the apostolic palace. that is swiss guard. the commandante generale of the roman carbinieri has joined us as well, in an advisory capacity, and the guarda nacionale have sent a representative.}

<D>__{a god damn nightmare.}
<A>__{they turn a corner and approach a squat stone building labeled "offizia della guarda suiza." two swiss guardsmen are standing outside the entrance to the building. they're somewhat comically dressed in puffy tunics vertically striped in brilliant blue and gold, with matching pantaloons and spats, topped by a black beret. langdon can't completely hide a smile. olivetti notices. the guards raise their eight foot swords, allowing the three of them to enter the building.}
