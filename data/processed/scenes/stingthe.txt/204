<A>__{snyder brings hooker into the crate room where capt. polk and the other agents are waiting. polk, as usual, has his coat off, revealing his shoulder holster.}
<C>__{polk}
<D>__{hello, mr. hooker. captain polk, f.b.i...}
<P>__{(shoving a chair over to him)}
<D>__{have a seat.}
<A>__{hooker remains standing.}
<C>__{polk}
<P>__{(ignoring it, drinking from a cup)}
<D>__{you want a drink or something?}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{polk}
<D>__{we want to talk to ya about henry gondorff.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{don't think i know him.}
<C>__{polk}
<D>__{well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb. you wouldn't wanna lie to me. lt. snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{lt. snyder doesn't know shit.}
<A>__{capt. polk almost laughs, but he checks it.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{you got nothin' on me.}
<C>__{polk}
<D>__{we'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up. grand larceny, extortion.}
<P>__{(with special emphasis)}
<D>__{counterfeiting, anything you want.}
<A>__{hooker says nothing, but it's not from defiance now. he's beginning to get the picture.}
<C>__{polk}
<D>__{look, i got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here. all you gotta do is tell us when gondorff's gonna play his chump. we come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird. no questions, no court appearance, nothing.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{polk}
<D>__{you've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. you wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{i will make parole.}
<C>__{polk}
<D>__{like hell. you won't even get a review till you're seventy. and if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard nose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin' there later.}
<A>__{hooker wants to come back with something, but can't find it.}
<C>__{polk}
<D>__{don't be a sap, kid. you could save us a little trouble. but henry gondorff is through whether you help us or not. there's nothin' left to do now but save yourself.}
<A>__{hooker's thoroughly whipped. he sits down for the first time.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{will you wait until the chump is played?}
<C>__{polk}
<D>__{hell yes. we don't care about the mark. he deserves what he gets.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(with heat)}
<D>__{i mean completely played. until he's beat and the score is taken. you come in before we beat him and i will kill him. you'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.}
<C>__{polk}
<D>__{all right, hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(barely audible)}
<D>__{just as long as i get to finish the play.}
