<L>__{exterior day esseker farmhouse}
<A>__{the wind blows over the land. in the winter season, the muddy fields have little to offer to the few starving crows flying over them. a feeling of desolation and solitude hangs over the deserted landscape. ben's car has left the asphalt road behind, driving through the countryside down a winding dirt road. an old farmhouse stands at the very end of the path. if it weren't for the parked pick up truck and the few piglets running wild, one would think that the farmhouse was abandoned. ben gets out of the car and goes to knock on the door. his shoes sink into the mud. he walks up the steps of the porch and peeks inside the house through the front window. in the dark he discerns the silhouette of a person who is watching tv. he can't help but notice all the mirrors have been covered or turned towards the wall. a big dog barks behind the window. ben steps back, surprised. the front door opens before ben has even made his presence known. a young man stares at him in silence.}
