<A>__{anna lies on the slab. she stares at us blankly. her face emotionless. resigned. eliot rinses her hair now dyed back to brown. she slowly closes her eyes. close on red dye draining into the sink. eliot picks up the scissors. carefully slices open anna's red slip. delicately peels the slip off her body. anna doesn't react. close on anna. she opens her eyes. confused. she turns her head... she's in paul's bedroom.}
