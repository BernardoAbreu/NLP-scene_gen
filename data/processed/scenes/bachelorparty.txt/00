<L>__{exterior st. ann's school day}
<A>__{camera pans a group of freshly scrubbed, innocent children, obediently standing in line, like recruits for the holy crusade. pull back to reveal they are wearing the gray blazers, striped ties and navy slacks of st. luke's school. they are waiting patiently at the curbside in front of the statue of the school's sainted namesake. one of the fifth grade boys pokes the kid next to him with his elbow. the other kid is about to retaliate when sister mary francis, a stern faced nun, appears behind them, grabbing them both firmly by the shoulders.}
<C>__{sister mary francis}
<D>__{make one more move and you'll both be staying late for the rest of the week.}
<C>__{the boys}
<P>__{(softly; in unison)}
<D>__{sorry, sister mary francis.}
<C>__{sister mary francis}
<D>__{i didn't hear you.}
<C>__{the boys}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{sorry, sister mary francis.}
<A>__{sister mary francis checks her watch. she scowls and looks out past the parking lot gate. suddenly we hear the sound of an engine roaring at full throttle. there is a screeching of brakes, followed by the loud grinding of gears. it sounds like the indy 500 is taking place around the corner.}
<C>__{sister mary francis}
<P>__{(used to this)}
<D>__{step away from the curb, children.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{zooming through the parking lot gates is a large yellow school bus. it practically takes the last turn on just two wheels. the bus driver quickly slams on the brakes, leaving ten feet of rubber behind him as the bus comes to an ear splitting halt right in front of them. the front door immediately swings open and rick stahl, the driver, hops out. rick is the life of the party, even when there isn't any party going on. while chronologically older than the st. luke students, the only thing that sets him apart from them is that he has a driver's license. rick figures he'll live up to his capabilities and get serious in his next life... this incarnation's strictly for laughs. sister mary francis steps up to him.}
<C>__{sister mary francis}
<D>__{you're late again, rick.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{i know, sister, but i have a very good excuse.}
<C>__{sister mary francis}
<D>__{there can be no excuse for tardiness.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{you're absolutely right. i should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. i'm just weak, sister; i'm so weak.}
<A>__{he starts sobbing softly into his hands.}
<C>__{sister mary francis}
<D>__{all right, stop that... children, on the bus.}
<A>__{the kids obediently file past rick, who makes like he is drying his tears with his handkerchief.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? if you do, why don't you give me a call. i'm in the book.}
<C>__{sister mary francis}
<P>__{(smiling despite herself)}
<D>__{get going, rick... you're late enough as it is.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{right... think it over.}
<A>__{he hops on the bus, closes the door and gently backs the bus out of the parking lot.}
