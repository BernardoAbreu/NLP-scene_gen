<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{she pulls out, a flashlight in her mouth.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{making sure no one sabotaged the gas lines.}
<A>__{frank watches her walk over to the fuse boxes.}
<B>__{minutes later}
<A>__{frank pokes through the cupboards. stocked with fine olives, tins of expensive smoked fish, viands, stewed fruit from orchards in france. he opens the icebox. inside is frozen meat and fish. he pulls out one package of frozen orange steaks it is labelled "barracuda, caught antigua, 8 07".}
