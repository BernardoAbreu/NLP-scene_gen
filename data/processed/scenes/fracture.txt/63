<L>__{interior crawford house living room dusk}
<A>__{it's getting dark out. techs pack equipment cases, carry them out. the place is a disaster area. marchand watches willy pace the living room.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{the garage? washer dryer?}
<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{and the tool shed, and the roof, and the h.v.a.c. ducts.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{what about the door frames? the floors?}
<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{what did he do: rip open a door frame, hide the gun inside and re plaster the wall before swat showed up?}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{what about the neighbors' property? he could have thrown it over the hedges.}
<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{we checked.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he might have passed it off to somebody, willy. had an accomplice, waiting, out the back.}
<A>__{willy shakes his head, grim. pacing.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{this isn't an accomplice sort of guy.}
<A>__{he slows. looking across the room at the big rube goldberg device. as he moves toward it:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{this is a...guy who likes to show off.}
<A>__{he examines the intricate workings, eyes travelling the clutter of metal and wires and motors. checks marchand who shakes his head.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{you sure?}
<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{i'm sure.}
<A>__{willy grimaces. fuming, relentless:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{it's a physical object. it can't just vanish. we're missing something some step in the story.}
<A>__{he begins walking through the crime, "the stations of the cross" re enacting it, starting from the front door, methodical, reciting it to himself:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{the neighbor sees her get home. he's already inside. she lets herself in. a minute or two later: blood pattern says she's standing over there he's somewhere around here.}
<A>__{willy stands where crawford was. raises a finger gun.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{boom.}
<A>__{as willy goes to where jennifer fell:}
<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{but then he carries her back there. why?}
<A>__{willy walks along the path defined by the drops of blood:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{because he's gonna need time. to confess. when she's alone with the cop.}
<A>__{willy stops in the alcove, looking down at the dried blood, the discarded paramedic supply wrappers.}
<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{neighbor comes to the door.}
<A>__{willy nods, comes out crosses to the foyer:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{crawford shouts, "leave us alone" and fires three more rounds: boom boom boom.}
<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{so everybody knows he's dangerous and she might still be alive.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{so they'll call the negotiator.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now he's got about ten minutes.}
<A>__{and that's it. he stands there with the imaginary gun in his hand. looking around. trying to think like crawford. he can't.}
<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{i'm sorry, willy.}
<A>__{willy won't respond because accepting the apology means admitting he's got nothing left.}
