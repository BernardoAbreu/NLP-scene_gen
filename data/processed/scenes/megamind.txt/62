<L>__{interior abandoned metro city library office day}
<B>__{on television}
<A>__{we see the news conference on the bank's steps. in the corner of the screen is written: "recorded earlier."}
<C>__{brad helms}
<D>__{for months now, since the death of uberman, the citizens of metro city have been holding out for a hero. well, it appears they won't have to hold out for much longer as a new costumed crusader has suddenly stormed onto the scene. today, at the metro savings and trust, a masked mystery man single handedly defeated "the fab four gang." just who is this new caped avenger?}
<A>__{brad holds the microphone to titan's face.}
<C>__{brad helms}
<D>__{i'm sure all of our viewers are now wondering, what's the "t" stand for?}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{it's a message to all the scum out there. uberman may be gone, but metro city has a new protector, and his name is "tighten!"}
<A>__{another reporter leans in.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{how do you spell that?}
<A>__{we pull back to see plato and da vinci watching this spectacle. master mind is sitting with them, reading a}
<B>__{newspaper.}
<C>__{master mind}
<P>__{(reading paper)}
<D>__{oh, for heaven's sake. i can't believe it. he misspelled his name.}
<A>__{master mind holds up the newspaper. the headline reads "metro's new hero: tighten."}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{no matter, i suppose.}
<A>__{master mind throws the paper on the floor and begins to pace around the room with his arms folded behind his back.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{we've now fully established titan as metro city's hero. they will love him just as they loved uberman. everything is going according to plan.}
<A>__{einstein leans over and whispers in plato's ear.}
<C>__{einstein}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{yeah, if the plan is getting us in jail.}
<A>__{master mind turns around, facing einstein. he walks over, standing face to face with the rebellious henchmen.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{you know, einstein, maybe i should have called you socrates. he also didn't know when to keep his thoughts to himself.}
<C>__{einstein}
<D>__{i just fail to see the point in all of this. i mean, why are we creating another superhero when it was such a pain in the ass for you to get rid of the other one? i mean, uberman is destroyed, we should be using this opportunity to...to...}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{to what?}
<C>__{einstein}
<D>__{i don't know. to take over the weather, space, the world whatever super villains are supposed to do.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{the reason someone like you will always be a minion is because you have no foresight. we take over the earth, like you said. then what? women? cars? money? even the grandest treasures will lose their lustre if you don't have someone to hold them over.}
<A>__{einstein throws up his hands. he's had enough. he pulls off his wig and throws it to the floor.}
<C>__{einstein}
<D>__{that's it! this balance of the force bullshit is getting way too oprah for me. i'm blowing. who's with me?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{you dare?}
<C>__{einstein}
<D>__{yeah, i dare. i'm sick of wearing stupid costumes, and i'm sick of working for a super villain who's turning into a softie.}
<A>__{plato and da vinci's mouths drop to the floor. they turn to master mind for his rebuttal.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{what did you call me?}
<C>__{einstein}
<D>__{you heard me. you used to be an inhuman monster, now look at you. you're creating super heroes, you don't go with us on robberies anymore, it's been days since you threatened anyone, oh, and not to mention this roxanne ritchi thing.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{that is none of your business, knave!}
<C>__{einstein}
<D>__{hey, you guys haven't sealed the deal yet, have you?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{silence!}
<C>__{einstein}
<P>__{(in a woman's voice)}
<D>__{oh, master, your head is so big.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{i'm warning you, einstein.}
<C>__{einstein}
<P>__{(in a woman's voice)}
<D>__{take me!}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{i said silence!}
<A>__{with his metal gauntlet master mind grabs einstein by the throat and lifts him into the air. einstein looks frightened as he tries to pry himself free of master mind's grip. master mind's eyes soften as if his heart is suddenly not into what he's about to do. he let's einstein drop to the floor.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{get out of my sight.}
