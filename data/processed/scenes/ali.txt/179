<T>__{past ali:}
<A>__{the concrete and cinder block walls to the dusty, bare ground are chromatic. primary colors. ethnographically interesting. ali sees interiors. broken walls. no roof. no plumbing. people come from a ditch with a shower curtain for privacy, surprised to see ali. faces indifferent to squalor. this is the ethnographically "interesting" surface of what, in fact, is civic disintegration starting to occur... it is the human concomitant to 13 years of mobutu kleptocracy.}
<B>__{ali}
<A>__{looks at the backs of the signs. he and we realize the signs' purpose: to hide the makeshift plastic walls and rooms made from cardboard containers and oil drums from the foreigners traveling the road to kinshasa. one teenager with a withered arm and a big smile runs up...}

<D>__{you beat them, ali!}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{foreman? i kill him!}
<A>__{he mimes knocking out foreman. something powerful is affecting ali. we don't know what it is. ali slows down... ...throws two lightning jabs and a hook. ali reaches to the kid's head and pulls a coin. he flips it to another kid and walks on. a second teenager comes out and wants ali to look at something around the back. he takes ali's hand...and holds it. ali complies. the entourage follows... around corner: kids' painting on wall it's an imitation fight poster. childlike caricatures in basquiat like brush strokes. foreman's got crosses for eyes. he's out! ali is victorious! his fist is raised. his cartoon face shouts his victory...the people's champion. there's more. there's knocked out white policemen, knocked out black soldiers, knocked out landlords, knocked out south africa, knocked out planes and tanks, knocked out tse tse flies...everything! so much, it means "all"...all expectation. this childish painting powerfully affects ali. the kids look at him. it's still. some kids in the back leap up in the air to see over taller heads what ali's doing.}
<B>__{ali}
<A>__{looks at individual faces. a grinning older man with a blue transistor radio (we'll see him later). a smiling kid. a girl with no shoes. a teenage kid jumping up and down...all looking at him. ali makes four pieces of rope appear. he rubs them together...}

<D>__{shazaam!!!}
<A>__{they become one. everybody goes nuts. as ali leaves, his eyes go back to the people and the painting...}
