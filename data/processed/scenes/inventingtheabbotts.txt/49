<L>__{interior high school corridor days later}
<A>__{doug makes his way along the crowded corridor showing a few of his wounds from his emergency landing in the rose bush. he slows as he nears pamela at her locker. she's aware of him, but pretends that she isn't. doug hesitates as if he might say something to her, but loses his nerve and continues to mope along the hallway. pam's disappointment is plain to see. doug doesn't notice eleanor and a few of her girl friends approaching in the opposite direction. as they pass him eleanor smiles brightly and says:}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{hi, doug!}
