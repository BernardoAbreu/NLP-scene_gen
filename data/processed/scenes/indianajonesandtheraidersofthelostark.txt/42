<L>__{interior "the raven" saloon patan, nepal night}
<A>__{a huge stuffed raven, wings spread wide, is mounted behind the long bar in the noisy, crowded saloon. a lively mix of patrons is represented in the late hour tableau: nepalese natives, fierce sherpa mountain guides, sleazy international smugglers and fugitives, and, of course, mountain climbers from every corner of the earth. a tall nepalese, mahdlo, is the bartender. in a corner near the fireplace trouble breaks out suddenly between the groups at two neighboring tables. ferocious representatives from each table one a wild looking sherpa, the other a muscular australian climber jump up to face each other. as the two contenders stand poised for action, their respective supporters shift in their places, fondling lethal ice axes and clubs.}
<C>__{sherpa}
<D>__{gmoiska! shurga rintoik!}
<C>__{climber}
<D>__{aye! that'll be your last word.}
<A>__{the bar has quieted ominously and so we hear with startling clarity when a door behind the bar slams open with a huge bang! and some presence, too small to be seen as it moves through the forest of towering patrons, makes a beeline for the troubled corner of the bar. a path clears for it. the sherpa and the climber are about to kill each other when the presence arrives directly between them: she is marion ravenwood, twenty five years old, beautiful, if a bit hard looking. at this moment, however, that look does not hurt. she is not intimidated by the combatants; she jabs accusatory fingers into their chests. she is angry as hell. the patrons shrink under her gaze.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{that does it! i've been patient with you no goods long enough. i'm not open at 2 o'clock for myself, you know. it's all for you. and how do you repay me: trouble and noise and blood on my floor! i won't have it. everybody out! out! out! we're closed. closed! do your killing outside! and don't leave any bodies on the porch!}
<A>__{the place clears quickly. stragglers and grumblers are given special attention by marion and mahdlo, who has come from behind the bar carrying a big axe handle. mahdlo herds the crows out the front door as marion turns and walks behind the bar. a scowl on her lovely face, she has just begun clearing the bar of glasses when she notices one remaining patron huddled over a glass at the far end of the bar. grimacing in exasperation, she heads that way like a locomotive.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{hey you, deaf one! i said out of my place. i don't mean next easter, i mean now }
<A>__{she is almost on him when indy looks up smiling. marion stops, stares, shocked.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{hello, marion.}
<A>__{she hits him with a solid right to the jaw, knocking him off the barstool on the floor. he rubs his jaw and smiles up at her.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{nice to see you, too.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{get up and get out.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{take it easy. i'm looking for your father.}
<C>__{marion}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{well you're two years too late.}
<A>__{indy's attitude changes instantly. this is sad news. he is silent for a long time. mahdlo comes in the front door and hurries forward when he sees indy with marion. he looks to her for guidance, but she stays him with a gesture.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{go home, mahdlo. i will see you tomorrow.}
<A>__{mahdlo is hesitant, but lays the axe handle on the bar and goes out. indy has been barely aware of him. now he settles again on the barstool. marion has a vindictive look. she'll let him stay, but she wants to inflict as much pain as possible.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{avalanche. up there. he was digging. what else? he spent his whole life digging. dragging me all over this rotten earth. for what?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{do you find him?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{hell no. he's buried where he was working. probably preserved real good, too. in the snow.}
<A>__{suddenly the hardness cracks. she is on the verge of tears and does not want him to see them. she turns away and takes a whiskey bottle from the shelf, then turns back to pout herself a drink.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{not a bad way to go. doing what he loved.}
<C>__{marion}
<P>__{(vitriolic)}
<D>__{don't give me that stuff! what do you know?}
<P>__{(she takes a drinks)}
<D>__{i'm the one that was left in a bad way. he didn't have a penny. guess how i lived, mister jones. i worked here. and i wasn't the bartender.}
<P>__{(another swallow)}
<D>__{finally the guy that owned the joint went crazy. snow crazy. they took his away screaming. as they dragged him out, he said the place was all mine for life.}
<A>__{she looks around the saloon.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{can you imagine a more evil curse?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{so far, it's working.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{why not leave? go back to the states.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i will go back. i will get there. not that there's a soul there who knows my name or cares. but i will go. and when i do, they'll know me. 'cause i'm going to go back in style. with money. a goddamn lady!}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{where you gonna get it?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{if i knew that, you think i'd still be running this dive?}
<A>__{indy looks at her, thinking. under his gaze, she blushes, for reasons only she understands. she looks into her glass and, for a moment, she softens.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i will tell you something indy. i've learned to hate you in the last ten years. but somehow, no matter how much i hated you, i always knew that someday you'd come through that door. i never doubted that. something made is inevitable.}
<P>__{(hopefully)}
<D>__{why are you here... now... tonight?}
<A>__{indy takes a long time to answer.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i need one of the pieces your father collected.}
<A>__{marion's eyes go icy. she swings at him again with her right, but this time he catches her at the wrist. then he stops her left, which she has brought up to slap him.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{you son of a bitch! you know what you did to me, to my life? this is your handiwork.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i never meant to hurt you.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i was a child!}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{you knew what you were doing.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i was in love.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i guess that depends on your definition.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{it was wrong. you knew it.}
<A>__{indy releases her arms.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{look, i did what i did. i don't expect you to be happy about it. but maybe we can do each other some good.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{why start now?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{shut up and listen for a second. i want that piece your father had. i've got money.}
<A>__{this stops her.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{enough to get you back to the states. where are his things?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{gone. i sold it all. it was all junk. the junk he wasted his life on.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{everything?}
<A>__{marion nods.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(giving up)}
<D>__{that's too bad.}
<A>__{indy feels tired, defeated. marion is pleased.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{you look disappointed. i like that. how's it feel?}
<A>__{indy has to smile at her glee.}
<C>__{marion}
<P>__{(nods at his empty glass)}
<D>__{what are you drinking?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{seltzer.}
<C>__{marion}
<P>__{(refilling his glass)}
<D>__{real man's drink. me, i like scotch. and i like bourbon. and vodka and gin. i'm not much for brandy. i'm off that.}
<A>__{she pours herself another as indy watches, amused.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{you're a tough broad now, aren't you?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{it's no act, pal. this ain't schenectady.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i can only say i'm sorry so many times.}
<A>__{marion looks at him thoughtfully, takes a drink.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{you really have money? you don't look rich.}
<P>__{(indy nods)}
<D>__{i may be able to locate some of his things. i know who's got them. what do you want?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{a bronze piece, about this size. in the shape of the sun. probably broken off at the bottom. has a little hole in it, off center. does that sound familiar?}
<A>__{marion thinks, nods slowly.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{do you know where it is?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{maybe. how much?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{three thousand. american.}
<C>__{marion}
<P>__{(negative)}
<D>__{that'll get me back, but not in style. this doodad must be pretty important.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{maybe.}
<A>__{a huge smile lights up marion's face.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i knew it would happen eventually. i knew it. something had to go my way.}
<P>__{(pours herself another drink)}
<D>__{i've got to think this out. i'm used to bargaining with yaks.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{okay, five thousand. that's all i can give you now. i can get you more when you land in the states.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{you word, huh?}
<P>__{(indy nods)}
<D>__{just like you said you'd be back last time? that was your word too.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i'm back, aren't i?}
<A>__{marion sneers and they smile together.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{you can trust me.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{come back tomorrow.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{because i said so, that's why. it's about time i called the shots in this relationship.}
<A>__{indy nods, gets up to go.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{wait a minute. leave the five thousand here.}
<P>__{(indy hesitates)}
<D>__{you want trust, give some. i want to smell your money.}
<A>__{indy thinks about this a moment, then reaches inside his shirt and pulls cash from a money belt. he lays five grand on the bar.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i trust you.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{you're an idiot.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i've heard that.}
<A>__{indy starts for the door. marion takes another think. she is getting high.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{hold it. come here.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(moving back)}
<D>__{bossy, aren't you?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{that's right. give me a kiss.}
<A>__{indy looks into her eyes, then leans over the bar and kisses her deeply. when the kiss ends, their faces are very close. marion is flushed. she liked it and would like more. she raises her glass between them to discipline herself.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{get out of my place.}
<A>__{indy smiles and walks to the front door. then, without looking back }
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{tomorrow.}
<A>__{he's gone. marion stares after him, thinking. she takes a drink. then slowly, her hand comes up to loosen the scarf that is draped around her throat. it falls away, revealing her graceful neck above the dipping top of her blouse. hanging there on a gold chain against her white skin is a sun shaped golden medallion. the bottom looks broken off. marion lifts the medallion so she can see it in her hand, then looks thoughtfully after indy.}
