<L>__{interior hnn news center late afternoon }
<A>__{a cavernous three story room bristling with activity. at the center is the main hnn anchor desk, (where a news broadcast is in progress,) surrounded by scores of reporter's desks a la cnn. around the perimeter of the room are various tv studios looking out on kuala lumpur. all are broadcasting: a larry king type chat show; mtv; sports; a kitchen where a chef is preparing something flambeed. with its walls of monitors, equipment, and control rooms, the effect is overwhelming. harmsway will walk bond around the perimeter:}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{welcome to the new world order, mr. bond.}
<P>__{(starting to walk)}
<D>__{churchill had his armies; caesar had his legions; i have my divisions:}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{news, sports, business, entertainment. and these are my foot soldiers:}
<P>__{(a wave of his hand)}
<D>__{2000 people working on 14 floors to feed newspapers, 4 cable news networks, magazines, and 29 different cable tv channels in 35 languages.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{and still not a thing to watch.}
<A>__{he glances at the satellite control room, with a nasa type world map.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{...although it must be fun to have all those satellites.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{they're merely tools to disseminate information.}
<C>__{bond}
<P>__{(wryly)}
<D>__{or disinformation... if you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? maybe one degree a minute?}
<C>__{harmsway}
<P>__{(guffaws)}
<D>__{fantastic idea mr. bond! perhaps i should buy it for a book! it's totally preposterous, but }
<P>__{(off bond's reaction)}
<D>__{you amuse me. ...and now perhaps i can amuse you.}
<A>__{he stops at a video terminal. begins to type.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{let's see... first we have this james bond... i believe he's a field adjuster for lloyd's of london...}
<A>__{insert video screen bond's mi 6 cover }
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{then we have this james bond.}

<D>__{or perhaps you'd prefer this james bond }
<A>__{insert video screen bond's chinese file }
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{who i believe they call "007."}
<A>__{bond is not amused. harmsway is enjoying himself:}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{you see, mr. bond, you and i are both men of action. but your era is passing. words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. and make no mistake about it: in the right hands, they can be as deadly as your walther ppk.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{...words to live by?}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{your choice.}
<P>__{(glancing at his watch)}
<D>__{look at the time! come. there's someone i want you meet about a story i'm thinking of publishing.}
<A>__{as they leave, bond is frustrated by harmsway's "i don't care what you think you know i can crush you" attitude... and now, harmsway plans (and the operative word here is plans,) to use bond, to tie off the one other loose thread in his perfect crime:}
