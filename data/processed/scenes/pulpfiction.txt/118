<A>__{both jules and vincent are inside the car cleaning it up. vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while jules is in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs of brain. both are twice as bloody as they were before.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i will never forgive your ass for this shit. this is some fucked up repugnant shit!}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he's wrong, he's immediately forgiven for all wrong doings?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{man, get outta my face with that shit! the motherfucker who said that never had to pick up itty bitty pieces of skull with his fingers on account of your dumb ass.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i got a threshold, jules. i got a threshold for the abuse i will take. and you're crossin' it. i'm a race car and you got me in the red. redline 7000, that's where you are. just know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be drivin' a race car when it's in the red. it could blow.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{you're gettin' ready to blow? i'm a mushroom cloud layin' motherfucker! every time my fingers touch brain i'm "superfly t.n.t," i'm the "guns of navarone." i'm what jimmie walker usta talk about. in fact, what the fuck am i doin' in the back? you're the motherfucker should be on brain detail. we're tradin'. i'm washin' windows and you're pickin' up this nigger's skull.}
