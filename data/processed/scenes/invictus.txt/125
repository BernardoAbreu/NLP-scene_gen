<L>__{exterior mandela's house night}
<A>__{the bodyguards' bmw's flank the gate. as the gate opens linga gets out of one bmw, hendrick gets out of the other. they are alert. it is freezing cold. bundled up against the cold, mandela emerges through the gate and they close in on him. it is clear that he is pushing himself, physically.}
<C>__{linga}
<P>__{(traditional xhosa greeting)}
<D>__{i see you, father.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{morning boys.}
<C>__{hendrick}
<D>__{morning, sir.}
<A>__{they keep moving. it is too cold for anything else.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{how is your family, hendrick?}
<C>__{hendrick}
<D>__{top shape, sir. how about yours?}
<A>__{mandela's smile becomes fixed on his face.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{i have a very big family. 42 million people.}
<A>__{then, he stops, turns, heads back towards the house.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{i don't think i want to walk today.}
<A>__{hendrick realizes that he blundered, somehow. he shoots an anxious glance at linga who looks at him as if he'd just committed blasphemy. mandela goes through the open gate without a word. the gate closes behind him, leaving linga and hendrick to watch him through iron bars. linga turns on hendrick.}
<C>__{linga}
<D>__{we never ask him about his family.}
<C>__{hendrick}
<D>__{but he asks about ours all the time.}
<C>__{linga}
<D>__{think about it, man. he's separated from his wife. his children ... how often do you see them here?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he's not a saint, okay. he's a man, with a man's problems and he doesn't need us reminding him about them.}
<A>__{linga heads back to his bmw. hendrick stands at the gate, looking in at the house.}
