<A>__{he opens his eyes, listens, then turns over and goes back to sleep. not suspecting. not yet.}
<L>__{interior landon's bedroom same time}
<A>__{dreary. landon lies in bed, flipping the tv channels, past "square pegs," "miami vice," mtv, to a british nature documentary. after a moment, he searches for a pen and paper. titles it "life list." pause. he doesn't know what to write.}
<L>__{exterior beaufort high parking lot morning (before school)}

<D>__{you guessed right.}
<A>__{she gives him a funny look and walks away. a better person than he and he knows it.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{that's one girl who can't take a hinterior}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{because she doesn't know what a hint is.}
<A>__{they laugh. landon the loudest. it feels good, but he also feels a little... bad.}
