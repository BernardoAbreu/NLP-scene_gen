<L>__{interior courtyard day}
<A>__{people peer in through every opening. mehboub's chest is bandaged. sunil squeezes through the packed courtyard and hallway, ashish carrying a wounded woman behind him. hasari steps into a doorway, us with him.}
<L>__{interior examining room max, aloka, poomina}
<A>__{max, blood crusted on her face, sutures poomina's awful facial wound as aloka prepares a compress.}
<C>__{aloka}
<D>__{will she... her face, will it...}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{if she's very careful and doesn't do anything to open the wound, the scarring will be minimal.}
<P>__{(to poomina)}
<D>__{do you understand? you can't... you have to stay here.}
<P>__{(to joan)}
<D>__{you make her stay here.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i will try.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{don't goddamn try, joan! goddamn do it!}
<A>__{poomina peers through her pain at max, his hands putting her back together.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(a litany)}
<D>__{i hate this place, i hate this place, i hate this place.}
<A>__{max looks at the doorway and he locks eyes with hasari. max breaks the contact. hasari stares at him as we hear the godfather's music on the radio.}
