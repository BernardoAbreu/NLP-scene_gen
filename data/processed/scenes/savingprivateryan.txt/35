<L>__{exterior st. mere street night}
<A>__{small arms fire echoes through the village. distant artillery booms. miller leads his men from the ruins of the cathedral toward the outskirts of town. they're just a small squad, but these six, heavily armed men, in full battle gear, are very formidable looking.}
<L>__{exterior st. mere outskirts night}
<A>__{miller's men are getting ready to move out. captain hamill and a few of his men are there to see them off. suddenly:}
<B>__{a flash of light appears on the horizon}
<A>__{then repeated flashes of light. the sky is on fire. the air trembles. a far off rumbling thunder rolls over the countryside like a tidal wave. then, the opposite horizon lights up as well. it's a massive artillery battle. the magnitude of the fury is incredible, strange, other worldly.}
<B>__{every man there is transfixed.}
<A>__{frozen in place. the lights play on their faces. miller looks down and sees his hand quivering. sarge notices, says nothing. miller stares at his hand, forcing it to stop. their eyes go back to the blazing sky.}
<C>__{sarge}
<P>__{(awe struck)}
<D>__{makes you feel small, doesn't it?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{it doesn't take this.}
<A>__{upham's face shows more fear than awe.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{i wasn't made for this.}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{you think the rest of us were?}
<A>__{upham recoils. miller instantly regrets his words. he turns to upham and sees that he's really scared. miller get a hold of himself and speaks gently.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{don't worry, upham, god'll protect you, this shit's gonna keep him up all night, anyway.}
<A>__{upham manages a slight smile. miller watches the lights for a moment more, then he pretends to shrug it off.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{let's go, this ain't what they pay us for.}
<A>__{captain hamill is next to snap himself out of it. he points the way. captain hamill along the wall, about thirty yards, there's a gate, on the other side, a drainage ditch, stay low until you clear the second field, then you'll hit the woods. as miller and his men shoulder their gear and prepare to move out, on of captain hamill's men, the gentle faced private who was so interested in the talk of private ryan, steps up with a couple bandoleers of b.a.r. ammo. he offers them to reiben. gentle faced private here. reiben looks at the bandoleers and is about to give a smart ass response, when a look at the gentle faced private's vulnerable expression stops the comment dead. gentle faced private my older brother was killed at guadalcanal...these might come in handy. reiben takes the ammo.}
<C>__{reiben}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{just what i need.}
<A>__{miller steps over, takes the bandoleers from reiben and hands them back to the gentle faced private.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{thanks, but you may need these more than us, or ryan.}
<A>__{captain hamill nods to the gentle faced private who takes the ammo back.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{let's move out.}
<A>__{miller and his men head off along the wall into the darkness, lit intermittently by the distant flashes. captain hamill and his beleaguered men, watch them go with dread and a strange bit of hope.}
