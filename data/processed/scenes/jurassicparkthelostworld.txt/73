<A>__{from the swaying jungle, there is another answering roar. and this one's closer. in the high hide, the rest of the group stares, trembling. in the distance, a flock of birds shrieks and takes flight as the tops of some trees move, a whole section of forest suddenly coming alive, as if brushed by wind. but it's not the wind. they hear noises, thuds in the jungle. and then another section of forest trembles. closer. another flock of birds bursts out of the treetops and swarms past the high hide.}
