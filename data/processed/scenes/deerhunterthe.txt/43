<A>__{merle weaves down the street in front of the growling red pontiac. merle is not just running. he is leaping and bounding, as if released from gravity and entered into a realm of pure ethereal space. nick, albert, vince and john pound down the street behind the pontiac, albert carrying merle's clothes.}

<A>__{the road forks, one road going high to a parking area, the other descending to the valley below. merle swerves up the incline toward the parking area, while the pontiac goes straight and disappears down the hill. albert, vince and john stagger to a stop, panting helplessly. nick grabs merle's clothes from albert and takes off up the hill.}
