<L>__{int: natural history museum day}
<A>__{we track past a sign that says "museum of spiritual selection and alchemistry." in the distance we can see a group of people in the hazy light. cut to augustus the man we saw with silus earlier sitting on a chair surrounded by various objects. at his feet are a gaggle of school children, aged around ten; affluent looking, human. augustus points to a strange, ancient looking glass apparatus.}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{300 years ago, with these simple instruments, the alchemist guiseppi de angelo discovered what we today call genetic science.}
<C>__{augustus}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{he deciphered that the brothers were a new race of beings, sent by god, to serve and protect you.}
<A>__{we see the faces of the children, rapt.}
<C>__{augustus}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{de angelo formed the church of the brotherhood. he was a great great man, but there were others, bad men, who took what de angelo had discovered and experimented without concern for the results. the science of genetics and all its power has been banned ever since. who can tell me what came from these bad experiments?}
<A>__{one child puts his hand up. behind the child, in the distance, augustus now sees silus approaching; silus obviously wants to talk to augustus. augustus points to the child while looking at silus.}
<C>__{augustus}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{child}
<D>__{all the bad things. like bad germs and flu.}
<A>__{augustus nods, watching silus' ominous expression.}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{yes. that's right.}
<A>__{augustus looks at the child and tries to smile.}
<C>__{augustus}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{all the bad things.}
