<L>__{exterior path day}
<A>__{quoyle and bunny alone, hand in hand, walking slow where they once picked berries. nobody's talking.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{when you gonna ask?}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{when you're in the mood.}
<A>__{apparently, that hasn't happened yet. more walking.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{she musta done something. really bad.}
<A>__{said like he means it. which he does. and bunny, squinting up, sees that.}
<L>__{intercut...the crime. playground filled with kids. bunny and}
<A>__{girlfriends on the jungle gym. bunny the best, a natural jock. mrs. lumbull large, sour, doughy, and betrayed by life, stands with her silver whistle in the midst of chaos. her thoughts on a higher plane.}
<C>__{bunny }
<D>__{she's the worst one of all!}
<A>__{little herry prowse comes to tug at the teacher's wool coat. he is holding his crotch and jumping up and down. this does not require an advanced credential to interpret.}
<C>__{bunny }
<D>__{herry told her he had to pee. but the way he talks. he could just say 'eeee,' like that.}
<A>__{mrs. lumbull looks down. from her face as she responds, she has already devoted, over time, more professional attention to this troublemaker than should be asked of any dedicated educator.}
<C>__{bunny }
<D>__{she told him that recess was almost over, an' she wasn't gonna make a trip special, an' he could hold it.}
<A>__{herry, seemingly, disagrees. still holding his crotch, he jumps up and down with greater agitation. she grabs him, rather roughly, by the arm. marches him over to...}
<C>__{bunny }
<D>__{she made him stand against the wall.}
<A>__{...and walks off, pointedly ignoring him from ten feet away. he screams, pumping his fists in frustration. grabs himself, suddenly. whether or not we can see the dampness spread, we can see his humiliation all too clearly. as his tears come... ...a figure bolts into frame from behind mrs. lumbull. hunched over like a linebacker, full speed ahead, launching herself into the back of the large woman's knees. her feet go up, and the rest of her goes... ...down like the proverbial amount of bricks. herry's tears stop fast. watching the woman shriek, and keep shrieking. makes him laugh. cut... back to...the berry path. they are sitting on a fallen log.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{see, a good dad would say hitting is always wrong. you coulda hurt her bad. i guess you know that.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{she wasn't hurt for real. just screamed like a baby.}
<A>__{quoyle pulls out a single snickers bar.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{wish i'd seen it. it really sounds funny.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{petal'll think so, too.}
<A>__{he looks at her. nods, probably will. peels the candy bar free of its wrapper.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{well, there won't be any trouble at school. i'ii take care of that.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{how?}
<A>__{he breaks the candy bar in half. tho not quite equally.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{because the best thing about people. is they can forgive each other. i heard that this morning.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{that teacher. is gonna forgive me?}
<A>__{he nods. oh, yeh.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{that. and she won't want the story printed in the paper.}
<A>__{oh.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{well. i don't wanna forgive her.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{me neither.}
<A>__{he holds out the two pieces of candy. she takes them both. the bigger one in his mouth. as he chews...}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{i had to do it. 'cept for wavey, i'm the only family herry's got.}
<A>__{she nibbles at her own piece.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{like the ghost. who's not a ghost.}
<A>__{hmmn?}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{the one who ties the knots? you're the only family he's got.}
<A>__{right? her father doesn't react. he's even stopped chewing.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{you said.}
<A>__{and slowly. quoyle nods. i said.}
