<A>__{calvin riding in the back of a driverless taxi cab. staring out the window, lost in thought. the cab pulls up to a curb.}
<C>__{taxi voice}
<D>__{we have arrived at your destination.}
<A>__{calvin. takes a beat. then swipes her card.}
<L>__{exterior calvin's condo estate night}
<A>__{elegant condos set on prime real estate. calvin heads down a tree lined walk towards her condo entrance.}
<C>__{spooner }
<D>__{one of my bullets hit your robot...}
<A>__{startled. she drops her key card. as spooner steps out from behind a tree. the tail of his coat, whipping in the wind.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{detective!...}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{and i think it's smart enough to repair itself don't you?}
<C>__{calvin}
<P>__{(studying him)}
<D>__{yes. i think so.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{any repair shop...}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{no. it's always the owner who brings the robot in for repair. where would a robot without an owner go?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i'm not sure what you're getting at.}
<C>__{spooner}
<P>__{(stepping closer)}
<D>__{does u.s. robotics have a factory in the city limits?}

<D>__{first. i want it brought in unharmed.}
<C>__{spooner}
<P>__{(doesn't like it, but)}
<D>__{agreed.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{second. i want to talk to it, alone.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{too dangerous.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{this model violated the three laws. it also moved and reacted differently than any robot i've ever seen. there must be some sort of logical explanation. i want to find out what that is. no police. no prosecutors. no you. just me and the robot.}
<A>__{spooner, looks down at this small woman. narrows his eyes.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{when they told me you were a psychologist, that wasn't the whole truth, was it?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i never said i treated human beings.}
