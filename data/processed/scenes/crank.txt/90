<L>__{int stairwell, moments later}
<A>__{chev busts into the stairwell and starts heading down. he’s been holding his gun awkwardly in his armpit; now he whips it out. a few flights above he hears the door bang open as the cops pick up the chase. he exits into the ...}
<L>__{int emergency room, moments later}
<A>__{the busy er is buzzing with activity. chev looks around desperately. the cops are right on his tail. suddenly the entrance doors burst open ... a patient is wheeled in at a dead run by a small group of emergency techs, all shouting instructions back and forth and barking at people to get out of the way as they race toward the far corridor. the fat man on the gurney has his shirt open ... he’s pale, glassy eyed and lathered in sweat ... they have the defibrillator paddles out ... behind the gurney a resident pushes a crash cart along with them ... the crash cart houses the defibrillator and various supplies ... chev takes off after them, bowling people over, flashing the gun.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{i know you motherfuckers have epinephrine!}
<A>__{the cops bang open the stairwell door, guns drawn. chaos breaks out.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{hold it right there, bro!}
<A>__{the group is galloping down the long corridor toward the elevators that connect to the o.r. ... three docs, the resident, chev and the fat man on the gurney ... the cops in hot pursuit, trying to get a bead on chev. chev is holding his gun to the resident’s head while pushing him and the cart forward. the resident blubbers in panic. the docs, in all the confusion, haven’t noticed chev yet.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{you’ve got epinephrine on this cart! i want that shit!}
<C>__{tech 1}
<D>__{he’s dropping! stand by to defibrillate!}
<A>__{the gurney slows down and the cart, shoved forward by chev, crashes into it. bodies fly, shit spills everywhere. the fat man lets out a groan, makes eye contact with chev.}
<C>__{fat man}
<D>__{my cart...}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{fat man}
<D>__{asshole...!}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{yeah, yeah.}
<A>__{chev spins around wildly and fires a few shots over the cops heads. they hit the deck.}
<C>__{tech 2}
<D>__{what is this? what the hell do you think you’re doing? this is a hospital!}
<A>__{chev shoves the gun in his face.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{shut up!!!}
<A>__{the doc shuts up. chev brandishes the gun toward the cops to keep them on the ground, then motions to the resident.}
<P>__{chev (cont’d)}
<D>__{you. get me some ... i need ...}
<A>__{chev is pale as a ghost ... his legs buckle ... he steadies himself against the wall.}
<C>__{resident}
<P>__{(haltingly)}
<D>__{you wanted ... epinephrine, is that right?}
<A>__{chev nods weakly. the resident, on his hands and knees, starts digging through the supplies spilled all over the floor. the cops, sensing weakness, start to tense. chev snaps out of it momentarily.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{don’t even think about it!}
<A>__{the resident approaches him cautiously, on his knees, holding out a handful of small white boxes.}
<P>__{chev (cont’d)}
<D>__{give me that.}
<A>__{he snatches them, cradling them against his stomach, and backs up past the docs toward the elevator just as the chime sounds and the doors slide open. he tosses the boxes inside. the fat man lets out another agonized groan.}
<C>__{fat man}
<D>__{... asshole...}
<A>__{chev points the gun at him.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{not going to tell you again.}
<A>__{he grabs a defibrillator paddle out of tech 2’s trembling hands and holds it to his chest.}
<P>__{chev (cont’d) (to the resident)}
<D>__{now juice me.}
<C>__{resident}
<D>__{you ... but ... i ...}
<C>__{chev}
<P>__{(weakly, not much left)}
<D>__{i haven’t got all day, just do it, will you?}
<A>__{the resident flips a switch on the crash cart and the thing begins to charge ... chev holds the paddle to his chest with one hand, the gun out with the other ... finally ... zappp!!!! chev flies backwards, bouncing off the wall like a pinball. the cops leap forward, trying to take advantage, but chev pops back up, wired and wild eyed.}
<P>__{chev (cont’d)}
<D>__{get down, assholes!}
<A>__{he fires another warning shot into the ceiling and leaps into the elevator as the doors close behind him.}
