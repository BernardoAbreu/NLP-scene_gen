<L>__{interior crack house day}
<A>__{virtual darkness save splinters of light between the curtains. pipes burn here and there in the gloom. ten or fifteen crackheads huddle around a battery operated tv on which tom brokaw is narrating an nbc documentary on drugs. a 12 year old sits against a wall too stoned even for television. hull approaches eddie, regally installed on an automobile bench seat cum sofa, a lit pipe in one hand. we barely notice the redhead kneeling between his legs, face buried in his crotch. he greets hull from wrecked bliss. they know each other now.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{my man, dudley, he's so fud ley...}
<A>__{hull greets eddie, some of the others, drops familiarly onto an adjacent auto seat. the patrons are making fun of brokaw, laughing, exchanging fives.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{eddie, man, i need...}
<A>__{eddie holds up a hand telling hull to wait. his mind is elsewhere. his features contract in brief concentration.}
<C>__{chorus of comments}
<D>__{whatever happened to that drug czar motherfucker?... he gave up 'cause he finally realized he didn't know nothing about any of that shit...}
<A>__{more laughter, etc. eddie's concentration peaks, breaks off into a sigh and a smile. eddie sings a satisfied little song... the redhead rises from eddie's crotch, and we see it's a boy, seventeen going on death; he might have been pretty a year ago. eddie passes him the crack pipe, lets him suck greedily for a few seconds before ripping it out of his scabrous mouth and offering it to hull, who, with a grimace that gets laughs, declines. the others continue to watch and comment on the speech.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{so what is it you need so bad, blood? need, need, need??}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{a whole k, quick as you can get it.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(impressed, a trace of envy)}
<D>__{comin' in the world, dudley.}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(winning grin)}
<D>__{all because of my man...}
<A>__{eddie likes that, holds out a hand. hull hits it.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{give me a day.}
<A>__{hull nods, rises.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{stick around, let the bitch hoover you, too.}
<A>__{indicating redhead. in all these scenes, hull acts indifferent to the horror, but here the effort costs him. he masters his disgust with a joke.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{only if you clorox him first.}
<A>__{everyone laughs, even the boy.}
