<L>__{interior bar night}
<A>__{a trendy bar, dimly lit and packed. we pan along the hip crowd and stop on jake speaking with a slick guy dressed in black armani.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{first thing about being on the grift.... you're only as good as your mark. the roper's the guy who finds them.}
<A>__{jake buys another round to the indifferent slick.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{they all have money one way or another. some of them come from money.}
<A>__{the scene doesn't change slick morphs into a fat texas business man wearing a ten gallon hat. he doesn't smile.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{there's that saying show me an honest man and i will show you a natural born liar. there's always that little bit of bad no matter how much good. it's that little itch on the back of you neck. you may not even know it's there, but it is.}
<A>__{the fat texan morphs into a wall street type suit, who remains stoic as jake reaches over for another round of drinks.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{a good roper knows how to scratch it you the outdoorsy type? "i was just fly fishing out in montana". you play the market? "i just got a tip on a tech start up ipo." you saw "the 'riverdance" twice? "i had a roommate in college who was gay." whatever...}
<A>__{wall street morphs into a thin euro trash man who takes a drink from jake without even a "thanks."}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{it means that in fifteen minutes we're on good terms. thirty, i'm your buddy.}
<A>__{euro trash morphs into an distinguished looking older man as he takes a sip.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{in an hour, i'm your best friend.}
<A>__{jake punctuates some unheard point with a slap on his knee.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{give me a day and you'll let me do your wife and daughter at the same time. it's too late for you...}
<A>__{jake looks up as the older man morphs into lionel dolby, the nervous mark from the earlier con.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{i have your confidence.}
<A>__{close up: dolby's lips loosen in a wide smile. jake smiles back. he puts his drink down, then takes the drink from dolby. they remain talking as the background }
