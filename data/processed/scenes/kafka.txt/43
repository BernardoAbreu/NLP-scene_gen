<B>__{the face}
<A>__{of a monster. horribly disfigured, scarred and stitched. and it isn't the kind of patchwork mess caused by acid or accident. there seems to be design behind it. human design. and beneath all this warped, mutilated flesh, almost unrecognizable ... the features of the vagrant snatched from the river. kafka's face revulsion. he goes.}
