<L>__{interior lecture films lobby morning}
<A>__{as mark walks through the lobby we get a brief glimpse of some of the movie posters lining the wall: "the holocaust", "the death of the dinosaurs", "napoleon", "the civil war". each poster shows a different austere man sitting in a chair, holding a script in his lap, with a title above his head. the posters are extremely boring. a tour guide leads a row of tourists through the lobby. as mark enters we overhear the tour guide's speech.}

<D>__{all of lecture films' productions are written, filmed and edited right here on this very lot. in fact, this building is where lecture films' talented writers scour through the world's past events, searching for the most entertaining, dramatic and even hilarious moments of world history, which are then turned into scripts, handed over to our world famous readers, and filmed for your viewing pleasure.}
<A>__{the whole tour "oohs". the tour guide walks over towards a large flat screen television embedded into the wall.}
