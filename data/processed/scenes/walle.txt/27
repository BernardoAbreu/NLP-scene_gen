<A>__{wall e has set up the tv on the roof. the blank eve floating next to him. tries unsuccessfully to play pong with her. still no response. finally, he gives up.}

<L>__{exterior truck next morning}
<A>__{wall e loads up his cooler. checks on eve one more time. still nothing... heads off to work, defeated.}
<L>__{exterior work site later}
<A>__{wall e simply going through the motions. no spirit in him at all. stops. pulls out the zippo lighter. flicks it a few times. a rush of wind blows out the flame. distant rumbling. wall e looks in the direction of his home. a bright glow is lowering down through the clouds.}
