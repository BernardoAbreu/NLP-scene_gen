<A>__{hal walks up to pat morita sporting a lone ranger type mask and wearing a purple and red superhero costume. it's not unlike uberman's except for a giant "t" on his chest. (from here on, hal is referred to as titan)}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{what's the "t" stand for? "pat morita" titan.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean? "pat morita" it's from roman mythology. zeus's father...oh, just go with it. you look perfect.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{i don't think this mask is big enough. are you sure no one is gonna recognize me? "pat morita" it's fine, just don't slouch. it's all in the posture.}
<A>__{he grabs titan's shoulders like a proud papa.}
<P>__{"pat morita" (cont'd)}
<D>__{it is time.}
