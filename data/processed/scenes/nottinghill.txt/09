<L>__{interior william's house day}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{spike!}
<A>__{the house has far too many things in it. definitely two bachelor flat. spike appears. an unusual looking fellow. he has unusual hair, unusual facial hair and an unusual welsh accent: very white, as though his flesh has never seen the sun. he wears only shorts.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{even he. hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{this is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{that's right i'm at last going out on a date with the great janine and i just want to be sure i've picked the right t shirt.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{what are the choices?}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{well... wait for it...}
<P>__{(he pulls on a t shirt)}
<D>__{first there's this one...}
<A>__{the t shirt is white with a horrible looking plastic alien coming out of it, jaws open, blood everywhere. it says 'i love blood.'}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yes might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{point taken.}
<A>__{he heads back up the stairs... talks as he changes...}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{i suspect you'll prefer the next one.}
<A>__{and he re enters in a white t shirt, with a large arrow, pointing down to his flies, saying, 'get it here.'}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{cool, huh?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yes she might think you don't have true love on your mind.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{wouldn't want that...}
<P>__{(and back up he goes)}
<D>__{okay just one more.}
<A>__{he comes down wearing it. lots of hearts, saying, 'you're the most beautiful woman in the world.'}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{well, yes, that's perfect. well done.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{thanks. great. wish me luck.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{good luck.}
<A>__{spike turns and walks upstairs proudly. revealing that on the back of the t shirt, also printed in big letters, is written 'fancy a fuck?'}
