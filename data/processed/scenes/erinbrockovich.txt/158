<A>__{mario and anna are sitting mutely in their seats beside ed and erin, firing blank looks across the table.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{let's be honest, here. two million dollars is more money than these people have ever dreamed of.}
<A>__{erin has no patience for this today.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{oh, see, now that pisses me off. first of all we got more'n a hundred plaintiffs. they may not be sophisticated, but they do know how to divide, and two million dollars isn't shit when it's split between them.}
<A>__{mario and anna exchange a look. this is getting interesting.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{erin }
<A>__{but there's no stopping her.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{and second of all these people don't dream about being rich. they dream about being able to watch their kids swim in a pool without worrying they'll have to have a hysterectomy at age 20, like rosa diaz a client of ours or have their spine deteriorate like stan bloom. another client of ours. so before you come back here with another lame ass offer, i want you to think real hard about what your spine is worth, mr. buda or what you'd expect someone to pay you for your uterus, miss sanchez then you take out your calculator and multiply that number by a hundred. anything less than that is a waste of our time.}
<A>__{and she gets up and storms out of the meeting.}
