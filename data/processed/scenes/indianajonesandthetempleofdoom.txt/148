<L>__{125. interior a mine tunnel night}
<A>__{indiana and short round are pushed down a tunnel by guards. they are stopped at a door and shoved inside.}
<L>__{126. interior mola ram's chamber}
<A>__{indiana and short round stumble into the chamber. it is a terri fying gallery of occult yantras, ritualistic statues and grisly icons of the evil thuggee sect. grotesque statues of kali's baleful minions line the walls. in a corner, there is another statue of kali herself, draped with flowers, necklaces of real human skills and slithering belts of live snakes. fresh blood has been splashed over the statue and at its base are the three sankara stones recovered from indiana. mola ram sits in a yoga position near the statue of kali. mola ram opens his eyes and he sees indiana and short round standing in chains before him.}
<C>__{mola ram}
<D>__{you were caught trying to steal the sankara stones.}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{nobody's perfect. the way i heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.}
<A>__{mola ram stands and gazes transfixed at the stones glowing on the altar.}
<C>__{mola ram}
<D>__{there were five stones in the beginning. over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{two are still missing.}
<C>__{mola ram}
<D>__{no. they are here somewhere. a century ago when the british raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest his the last two stones down here in the catacombs.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{that's what you've got these chil dren these slaves digging for?}
<C>__{mola ram}
<D>__{they dig for the gems to support our cause. they also search for the last two stones. soon we will have all five sankara stones and the thuggees will be all powerful!}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.}
<C>__{mola ram}
<D>__{you do not believe me? you will, dr. jones. you will become a true believer.}
<A>__{the door opens and mola ram bows slightly as the little maharajah enters. indy looks surprised and short round tenses.}
<C>__{mola ram }
<D>__{your highness will witness the thief's conversion.}
<A>__{mola ram nods and two guards grab indy. they drag him struggling to a rock and chain him to it. short round scuffles as he's pulled aside to watch. remembering the high priest's earlier open heart surgery, indi ana looks worried as mola ram approaches him }
<C>__{maharajah}
<D>__{you will not suffer. i recently became of age and tasted the blood of kali.}
<A>__{now the young initiate comes forward and indiana looks startled it's nainsukh. he is wearing robes and his eyes are glowing strangely. nainsukh hands mola ram a hollow human skull full of blood! the guards hold indiana's head back and force his mouth open. mola ram tips the skull and blood spills out of its death grinning jaws and flows into indiana's mouth. indy gags suddenly he spits the blood, spraying mola ram and the little maharajah. looking at his blood splattered clothes, the mahara jah is furious.}
<C>__{mola ram}
<D>__{hold him!}
<A>__{the little prince's eyes glow angrily and he hisses at indy }
<C>__{maharajah}
<D>__{you will learn to obey because you are powerless!}
<A>__{the little maharajah pulls a small krtya from his robes indy sees that the doll has been crudely fashioned to resemble him.}
<C>__{maharajah }
<D>__{i control you now!}
<A>__{the maharajah turns and sticks the doll into a flaming urn. in diana suddenly cries out and twists in pain as he is burned! the little prince smiles evilly and puts the doll back into his robes. then he goes over to where indy's whip and bag have been laid. he grabs the bullwhip.}
<C>__{maharajah }
<D>__{you told me that a whip could be an enemy to its owner. we shall see! turn him over!}
<A>__{as the guards turn indy face down, they rip off his jacket and chain his ahnds to the rock. the maharajah uncurls the whip he notices short round smiling snidely suddenly the maharajah cracks the whip it lashes out and cuts into short round's shoulder. blood appears and short round looks stunned by the lash and by the fact the marahajah knows who to use the whip.}
<C>__{maharajah }
<D>__{as dr. jones suggested, i have been practicing.}
<A>__{the little maharajah whirls and lashes the whip again. indiana jerks as the bullwhip rips through his shirt and tears open his flesh. the maharajah lashes again and again blood spurts across indy's tattered shirt. as the whipping continues short round jumps as if he is also be ing beaten. his eyes fill with tears as he watches indy suffer. finally, the little maharajah lets the whip fall limp. as the maharajah approaches indy, short round lunges as him angrily but the guards restrain him. indiana groans as he's turned over. blood trickles from his mouth and he stares up hatefully at mola ram.}
<C>__{mola ram}
<D>__{the british in india will be slaughtered. then we will over run the moslems and force their "allah" to bow to kali.}
<A>__{mola ram is once again given the human skull by a priest and he lifts it toward indy's face }
<C>__{mola ram }
<D>__{and then the hebrew god will fall and finally the christian god will be cast down and forgotten.}
<A>__{indy's head is held back and mola ram spills the blood it flows out of the mouth of the skull into indy's mouth.}
<C>__{mola ram }
<D>__{soon kali ma will rule the world!}
<A>__{indy's eyes look horrified as the blood flows from the skull down his choking throat some of the blood spills and falls to the floor we see the very earth trembling as the evil spreads a fissure appears beneath indy's feet and a small line of crimson lava oozes out and smiles evilly across the floor...}
