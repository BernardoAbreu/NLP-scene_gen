<L>__{interior county jail contact visiting room day}
<A>__{john stares out the window at the city beyond. life seems so close. he looks back into the large communal visiting room; a dozen round tables and plastic chairs. the concrete block walls are covered with naive paintings in bright colors and messages of hope. luke plays at his feet with a basket of legos. the door at the far side buzzes, a guard opens it and prisoners in red jump suits marked visiting room enter. lara enters and looks around. she is pale, thin and her hair has returned to its natural color. lara hurries to him and gives him a real kiss. she breaks and steps to luke, who plays with his back to her.}
