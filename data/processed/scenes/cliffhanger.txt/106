<A>__{that's a little narrower than your coffee table. it's got irregular breaks, causing it to go up or down several feet and gabe is jogging it, leaping across the ledge's gaps, leaning toward the wall and away from the four thousand foot drop. gabe's gotten his second wind he keeps jumping from ledge to ledge with the ease that comes from skill and familiarity, and with renewed purpose. gabe makes the last jump to a section of ledge near the bottom of the "bitker" ladder which consists of metal rungs woven into loose steel cable bolted into the rock, running two hundred feet to the top something left behind by a past expedition, now a tourist's toy. and the bottom rung is three feet above gabe's outstretched arms.}

<B>__{wider angle on mountain wall}
<A>__{a closer look at terrain seen earlier fifty yards away from the ladder, a waterfall is spewing out of the wall, giving the appearance that the mountain has sprung a torrential leak. as we track gabe up the ladder, we can see where the water's coming from a whirling lake on top of the mountain. its constant motion keeps it from totally freezing, but the lake is still coated with a veneer of ice, moving in thick chunks through circular currents on the surface. elsewhere on mountain slope hal and gang are negotiating the grade, which is slippery, thanks to the fresh, thick snow we can see from their relative position to the lake that gabe has a lead on them. a very slight one. top of ladder gabe pulls himself over and starts running as he does, he uproots a big, 3' x 3' park service sign commemorating the "bitker climb" and takes it with him, moving ahead into a}
