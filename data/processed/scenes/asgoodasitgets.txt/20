<D>__{so you're practically finished, huh?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{yes... well, there's one more stage trying to figure out if it's any good.}
<A>__{simon sneaks a look at the canvas from another perspective... he focuses then the smallest shy nod of self approval he's finished. vincent is desperate to distract. close on dog as verdell awakens, stretches and pricks his ears. he moves quickly to the closed door and starts to frantically scratch, attracting simon's attention. as simon keeps walking... vincent shoots over to the canvas.}

<D>__{wait i want to see the painting.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{just a second he has to go.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{please!! no!!!}
<A>__{simon opens the door and verdell shoots out like a bullet. vincent pauses before the painting and is thrown to see his humanity captured to be "immortalized."}
