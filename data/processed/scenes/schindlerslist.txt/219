<A>__{the door to an apartment opens from the inside revealing emilie schindler. she coolly considers the visitor on her doorstep, her estranged husband, looking great as usual, bottle of wine in his hand, smiling as if nothing is wrong between them, as if nothing is wrong in the entire world.}
<L>__{interior emilie's apartment night}
<A>__{the two of them at the kitchen table in a modest apartment, drinking, at least he is. he's trying to ask her something, but he's not sure how to put it, he wants to get it right. finally the words just tumble out }
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i want you to come work for me.}
<A>__{there, he's said it. but the bewildered look on emilie's face wonders, that's what was hard for you to say?}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{you don't have to live with me, i wouldn't ask that.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it's a nice place. you'd like it. it looks awful. you get used to that.}
<A>__{she's the only woman he's even known who could make him nervous just sitting across a table from him, saying nothing.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{all right }
<P>__{(now he'll be honest)}
<D>__{we can spend time together that way. we can see each other, see how it goes without the strain of whatever you want to call it when a man, a husband and a wife go out to dinner, go have a drink, go to a party, you know. this way we'll see each other at work, there we are, same place, we see how it goes...}
<A>__{his voice trails off. a shrug adds, what do you think? she doesn't answer, but she does love him. he loves her, too. it really is a shame they're not right for each other and never will be.}
