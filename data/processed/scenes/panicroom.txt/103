<A>__{thunk. meg's head falls back against a wall; she sags to the floor, legs folded in front of her, completely drained. but sarah's not drained, sarah's full of nervous ingenuity, rustling around through the stuff in the panic room, an idea forming in her head. she finds a powerful looking flashlight and loads it up with batteries. she tries it, flashing around the room. halogen bulb, very powerful, hurts her mother's eyes as she flashes it past. meg watches her. what's she up to? sarah lays on the floor in front of the ventilation tube she discovered earlier. she squints through it. through the tube, she can see out of the house, into the courtyard behind the brownstone. about thirty yards away she can see the backs of the brownstones on the next block, and directly across (because the tube doesn't leave much room for lateral vision) she can see straight into somebody's bedroom. there's a light on. a sleeping man is in bed, an open book on his chest. in the panic room, sarah sits back. she grabs the flashlight, looks for a little button on the top, the kind you can flick the flashlight on and off with. shining it on the wall of the panic room, she flashes it at a wall, three times, on and off. satisfied, she turns back to the tube. meg, curious, crawls across the floor to join her. sarah shoves the flashlight all the way into the tube, leaving enough room on either side of it for them to see through. meg lays down flat, squints into the tube, sarah alongside her. she looks at her daughter, curious your plan? sarah reaches into the tube, finds the little flash button on the top of the flashlight. through the tube, the piercing halogen beam begins to flash, across the courtyard and into the bedroom of the man in the bedroom. the light flashes on the wall over his bed. the flashes are in a rhythm. short. short. short. long. long. long. short. short. short. in the panic room, meg turns to sarah, impressed.}

<A>__{through the tube, the flashes continue dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot. but the man continues to sleep, the light on the wall behind him has no effect. in the panic room, sarah is frustrated. she adjusts the flashlight. through the tube, the beam of light lowers jerkily from the wall until it is shining directly into the sleeping man's eyes. in the panic room, sarah strains to keep the light in that perfect spot. she's starting to sweat. meg leans over, sneaks a peek at the watch sarah wears on her left wrist. the readout:}
