<A>__{master mind is pacing back and forth. the muted tv plays in the background.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{this has proven to be a challenge. i just don't know what i want. what do i want?}
<A>__{he stares at einstein, da vinci and plato, but they offer no advice.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{i want a man of moral fiber with a strong sense of right and wrong. someone who doesn't seek power instead, they must have it thrust upon them and find, within themselves, the courage to rise to the occasion.}
<A>__{einstein lets out a short laugh, getting everyone's attention.}
<C>__{einstein}
<D>__{yeah, well, it sounds like what you want is uberman.}
<A>__{master mind snaps the fingers of his non metal hand.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{that's it! why make a copy when the real thing will do?}
<A>__{the lackeys look at each other, they can't believe what they're hearing.}
<C>__{einstein}
<D>__{i was just kidding, sir. in case you forgot, you actually burned uberman alive.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{then we'll make a new one. plato, bring me the box!}
<B>__{minutes later}
<A>__{master mind and the lackeys stand in a circle around a small table. plato places a stainless steel chest in the tables center. as master mind opens it, he's immediately doused in white glow emanating from inside.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{behold uberessence. the very thing that gave uberman his superhuman powers.}
<C>__{einstein}
<D>__{where the hell did you get that?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{oh, i shot him with a power sucking gun and had this idea to use this to clone a whole army of evil ubermen. i'm not sure why i never got around to following up with that.}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{i believe he defeated you before you could, master.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{...right. man, he was good!}
<C>__{da vinci}
<D>__{you want another volunteer, sir?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{not another volunteer driven by the need for personal gain. somebody else, somebody pure.}
<A>__{master mind turns to see an interview with hal playing on the muted television. underneath his face is a blue caption with white lettering that reads: "hal stewart metro city's newest hero?"}
<C>__{news reporter}
<D>__{...who risked his own life to save that of a young mother and her child.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{please, please, you're embarrassing me. i saw someone in need and i helped them. what more can we ask of ourselves. i ask you, what more?}
<A>__{a smile creeps across the evil one's face.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{somebody like him!}
