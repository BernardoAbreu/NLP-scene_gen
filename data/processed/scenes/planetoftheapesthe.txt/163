<L>__{192 wider angle the threesome}
<A>__{taylor strides to the desk, writes something, hands it to zira.}
<C>__{zira}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{'then how do you account for me?,}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{i don't. and i'm not going to try.}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{but what about your theory? the existence of someone like taylor might prove it.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<P>__{(shushing her)}
<D>__{zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{don't be foolish. if it's true, they'll have to accept it.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{no, they won't }
<A>__{taylor touches zira on the arm, makes a gesture of inquiry.}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis }
<C>__{cornelius}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{it's probably wrong }
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{ that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. in his trip to the forbidden zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time }
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{the evidence was very meager }
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{you didn't think so then.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{that was before dr. zaius and half the academy said the idea was heresy.}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{how can scientific truth be heresy? what if taylor is exactly the proof you needed? a mutation. a missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape }
<A>__{taylor bangs his fist on the desk, mouths the word "no!" scribbles something on a piece of paper.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{he's touchy, isn't he?}
<A>__{taylor thrusts the sheet at zira, who reads it aloud.}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{'i am not a missing link.'}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{because if he is a missing link, it means the sacred scrolls aren't worth their parchment.}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{well, maybe they're not.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{no, thank you'. i won't get into that battle.}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{oh, cornelius, show some strength!}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{zira, listen to me. we've got a fine future ahead of us. marriage. stimulating careers. i'm up for a raise }
<A>__{at that moment there is a. loud rap at the door o.s. all turn.}
