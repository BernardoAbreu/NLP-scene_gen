<A>__{the bathhouse has a stove which heats water. there is a brazier to create instant steam, but not now. levin, almost naked, lies on a plank deck, thoughtful, staring at something . . . no, at someone: serafina, who is put ting on her clothes. postcoitum. she has no angst. dressed, she crosses herself.}
<C>__{levin}
<D>__{will you go to confession?}
<A>__{serafina nods indifferently.}
<C>__{levin }
<D>__{god will forgive you.}
<C>__{serafina}
<D>__{and you also, master. he is watching.}
<C>__{levin}
<D>__{god forgive us then, for committing the act of love.}
<A>__{she nods without irony.}
<C>__{serafina}
<D>__{he is merciful.}
<C>__{levin}
<D>__{"not according to my deserts, o lord, but according to thy mercy" that's a fine prayer. but i'm full of doubt. sometimes i even doubt that god exists.}
<C>__{serafina}
<D>__{how can there be anything if god didn't make it?}
<C>__{levin}
<D>__{i don't know. one day science will tell us.}
<C>__{serafina}
<D>__{that's sinful talk if the priest heard you.}
<C>__{levin}
<D>__{well, i won't go to confession.}

<D>__{your father built the church. you're con fessed a while yet.}
<A>__{levin feels outplayed.}
<C>__{serafina }
<D>__{will you bring me something from moscow?}
<C>__{levin}
<D>__{what would you like?}
<C>__{serafina}
<D>__{soap, the kind wrapped in paper to look pretty, and smelling like for a proper lady.}
<A>__{levin is touched. he nods. sound over music overlap with the ball.}
