<L>__{interior susan's room late night }
<A>__{a little later. all the lights are lit. susan, in a nightgown, is in bed, asleep. raymond and a nurse are just leaving the room, raymond closing the door quietly behind him. dr. corey rises.}
<C>__{dr. corey}
<D>__{she'll be perfectly all right in a day or two, mr. kane.}
<A>__{kane nods. he has a small bottle in his hand.}
<C>__{dr. corey}
<D>__{the nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, i should be only too glad i shall be here in the morning.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{thank you. i can't imagine how mrs. kane came to make such a silly mistake. the sedative dr. wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle i suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.}
<C>__{dr. corey}
<D>__{i'm sure that's it.}
<P>__{(he starts out)}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{there are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?}
<C>__{dr. corey}
<D>__{not at all. i'd like the nurse to be here, too.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{dr. corey leaves. kane settles himself in a chair next to the bed, looking at susan. in a moment, the nurse enters, goes to a chair in the corner of the room, and sits down.}
