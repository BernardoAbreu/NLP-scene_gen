<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{i don't really think you need cheesy poofs, tubby }
<A>__{but the boys come to an abrupt halt when they reach the living room and see that all four mothers are waiting for them, silently. everyone just sits there for a second. the lighting on kyle's mother's face looks almost evil.}
<C>__{kyle's mother}
<D>__{boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.}

<C>__{stan's mother}
<D>__{stanly, you're too young to understand what's good for you. that's why we mothers have taken charge.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{but they fucking didn't do anything wrong!}
<C>__{cartman}
<D>__{yeah! and what rim job expert went and outlawed cheesy poofs!?}
