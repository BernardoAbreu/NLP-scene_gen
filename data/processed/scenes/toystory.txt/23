<D>__{let's go to my room, guys!}
<A>__{the kids rush past the houseplant.}

<P>__{(into the monitor)}
<D>__{red alert! red alert! andy is coming upstairs!}
<L>__{interior andy's bedroom continuous}
<A>__{woody puts the last battery back in.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{there.}
<C>__{sargent }
<P>__{(over monitor)}
<D>__{juvenile intrusion! repeat! resume your positions now!}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{andy's coming, everybody! back to your places. hurry!}
<A>__{the toys panic and scatter about the room.}
<C>__{mr. potato head}
<D>__{where's my ear? who's seen my ear? did you see my ear?}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{outta my way! here i come, here i come }
<A>__{frantic, rex slams into a trashcan and falls over. everyone scurries to their places as the kids' footsteps grow louder. woody falls limp in his spot on the bed just as... andy's bedroom door flies open and a flood of children's feet rush in.}
<D>__{friend #1 hey, look! his lasers light up.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{take that, zurg!}
<A>__{woody is flung off andy's pillow and slides, unnoticed, down the gap between the bed and the back wall.}
<D>__{friend #2 quick! make a space! this is where the spaceship lands.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{ and you press his back and he does a karate chop action!}
<C>__{mrs. davis }
<D>__{come on down, guys. it's time for games! we've got prizes!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{oh, yeah!}
<A>__{the kids all run out as fast as they entered, slamming the door behind them.}
<B>__{beat}
<A>__{the toys slowly come to life and make their way toward the bed.}
<C>__{mr. potato head}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{bo peep}
<D>__{can you see it?}
<C>__{slinky}
<D>__{what the heck is up there?}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{woody? who's up there with you?}
<A>__{woody crawls out from under the bed. the toys are shocked to discover him there.}
<C>__{slinky}
<D>__{woody, what are you doing under the bed?}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(composing himself)}
<D>__{uh h h h...nothing! uh, nothing. i'm sure andy was just a little excited, that's all. too much cake and ice cream, i suppose. it's just a mistake.}
<C>__{mr. potato head}
<D>__{well, that mistake is sitting in your spot, woody.}
<C>__{rex}
<P>__{(gasp!)}
<D>__{have you been replaced?}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{hey! what did i tell you earlier? no one is getting replaced.}
<A>__{the toys give each other a look of doubt.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{now let's all be polite, and give whatever it is up there a nice, big "andy's room" welcome.}
<A>__{woody climbs slowly up the side of the bed, peeking over the edge. his eyes widen at the sight of...}
<B>__{buzz lightyear}
<A>__{we see buzz as woody does an expensive looking space age action figure, covered with buttons and stickers from head to toe. the imposing "g.i. joe sized" doll stands heroically in the center of the bed, his back to woody. woody gulps. buzz comes alive and looks around. angle: buzz's pov through his helmet while he scans the bedroom a "darth vader" like breathing is heard. buzz eyes it all suspiciously and pushes a button on his chest. sfx: electronic beep}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{buzz lightyear to star command. come in, star command.}
<A>__{nothing. he pushes the button again.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{star command come in. do you read me?}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{why don't they answer?!!}
<A>__{just then, buzz catches sight of his ripped packaging. the box is designed to look like a spaceship.}
<C>__{buzz}
<P>__{(gasp)}
<D>__{my ship!!}
<A>__{he runs up to the box and investigates the damage.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{blast! this'll take weeks to repair!}
<A>__{buzz flips open a plastic compartment on his arm his wrist communicator.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{buzz lightyear mission log. stardate 4072: my ship has run off course en route to sector 12. i've crash landed on a strange planet. the impact must have awoken me from hyper sleep.}
<A>__{buzz springs up and down on the squishy surface of the bed.}
<C>__{buzz}
<P>__{(into communicator)}
<D>__{terrain seems a bit unstable...}
<A>__{he taps the sticker of controls on his wrist communicator.}
<C>__{buzz}
<P>__{(into communicator)}
<D>__{no read out yet if the air is breathable... and there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere }
<A>__{angle: buzz's pov through his helmet woody's face suddenly pops into view.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{hello o o...}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{ho yaaahh!!!}
<A>__{buzz jumps back, taking a fighting stance. he presses a button on his arm that turns on a red "laser beam" light on his wrist. buzz aims the red beam on woody's forehead and holds it there.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{aaaaaaah! whoa, hey, whoa, did i frighten you? didn't mean to. sorry. howdy! my name is woody and this is andy's room. that's all i wanted to say, and also, there has been a bit of a mix up. this is my spot, see, the bed here }
<A>__{while woody is speaking, buzz notices the sheriff's badge on woody's vest.}
<C>__{buzz}
<P>__{(de activating his laser beam)}
<D>__{local law enforcement! it's about time you got here. i'm buzz lightyear, space ranger, universe protection unit. my ship has crash landed here by mistake.}
<A>__{buzz begins walking around the bed, surveying the situation. woody tries to keep up.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{i need to repair my turbo boosters. do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{well, let's see, we've got double a's }
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{watch yourself!!}
<A>__{buzz shoves woody down on the bed and re activates his wrist laser.}
<C>__{buzz}
<P>__{(continued)}
<D>__{halt! who goes there?!}
<A>__{the other toys are peeking over the edge of the bed.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{don't shoot! it's okay! friends!}
<C>__{buzz}
<P>__{(to woody)}
<D>__{do you know these life forms?}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{yes. they're andy's toys.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{alright, everyone. you're clear to come up.}
<A>__{buzz walks over to the toys.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{i am buzz lightyear. i come in peace.}
<A>__{rex steps forward and eagerly shakes buzz's hand.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{oh, i'm so glad you're not a dinosaur!}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{why, thank you...}
<P>__{(pulls away)}
<D>__{now thank you all for your kind welcome.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{say! what's that button do?}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{i will show you.}
<A>__{buzz presses a button on his chest.}
<C>__{buzz }
<D>__{buzz lightyear to the rescue!}
<A>__{the toys all gasp in awe.}
<C>__{slinky}
<D>__{hey, woody's got something like that. his is a pullstring, only it }
<C>__{mr. potato head}
<D>__{only it sounds like a car ran over it.}
<C>__{hamm}
<D>__{oh yeah, but not like this one. this is a quality sound system. probably all copper wiring, huh? so, uh, where are you from? singapore? hong kong?}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{well...no, actually i'm stationed up in the gamma quadrant of sector 4. as a member of the elite universe protection unit of the space ranger corps, i protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion from the evil emperor zurg, sworn enemy of the galactic alliance.}
<A>__{as buzz speaks, woody glances down at the box in which buzz arrived. angle: back of buzz's box there is a cartoon drawing of buzz giving the exact, word for word spiel that buzz is now giving.}
<C>__{mr. potato head}
<D>__{oh, really? i'm from playskool.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{and i'm from mattel. well, i'm not actually from mattel, i'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy out. well, i don't really understand the financials, but...}
<A>__{woody walks over to bo peep.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{you'd think they've never seen a new toy before.}
<C>__{bo peep}
<D>__{well sure, look at him. he's got more gadgets on him then a swiss army knife.}
<A>__{slinky presses the button on buzz's arm, activating his laser light. buzz quickly pulls his arm away.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{ah, ah, ah, please be careful! you don't want to be in the way when my laser goes off.}
<C>__{mr. potato head}
<D>__{hey, a laser! how come you don't have a laser, woody?}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{it's not a laser! it's a little lightbulb that blinks!}
<C>__{hamm}
<D>__{what's with him?}
<C>__{mr. potato head}
<D>__{laser envy.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{all right, that's enough. look, we're all very impressed with andy's new toy }
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{toy?}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{t o y. toy.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{excuse me, i think the word you're searching for is space ranger.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{the word i'm searching for i can't say because there's pre school toys present.}
<C>__{mr. potato head}
<D>__{gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{oh, uh, mr. lightyear? now i'm curious. what does a space ranger actually do?}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{he's not a space ranger! he doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly }
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{buzz calmly hits a button and wings pop out. again the toys gasp in awe.}
<C>__{hamm}
<D>__{oh, impressive wingspan. very good!}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{oh, what?!...what?! these are plastic. he can't fly!}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{they are a terillium carbonic alloy and i can fly.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{no, you can't.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{yes, i can.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{you can't!}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{can!}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{can't! can't! can't!}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{i tell you, i could fly around this room with my eyes closed!}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{okay then, mr. lightbeer! prove it.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{all right, then, i will.}
<P>__{(to toys)}
<D>__{stand back everyone!}
<A>__{the crowd of toys make room for buzz as he heads towards the edge of the bed and climbs up the bedpost. he poses like a high diver, shuts his eyes...}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{to infinity and beyond!!}
<A>__{...and leaps off the bed. buzz plummets straight down, hits a big rubber ball and bounces right back up. he then lands on a hotwheels car, which races him down the track, through the loop, and off a ramp. buzz soars upward into a plane mobile hanging from the ceiling. buzz becomes wedged between the plane's wheels. the impact turns on the plane's motor making it (and buzz) spin around and around. all the other toys watch from the bed, mesmerized. finally the centrifugal force causes buzz to separate from the plane, sailing him across the room toward the bed. buzz makes a perfect landing right in front of woody and then opens his eyes.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{can.}
<A>__{the crowd of toys rush buzz, cheering and clapping with}
<B>__{adoration.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{whoa! oh, wow! you flew magnificently!}
<C>__{bo peep}
<D>__{i found my moving buddy!}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{why, thank you. thank you all. thank you.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{that wasn't flying! that was falling with style!}
<C>__{mr. potato head}
<D>__{man, the dolls must really go for you!}
<P>__{(aside)}
<D>__{can you teach me that?}
<A>__{woody stands alone at the other end of the bed, fuming. slinky, caught up in the euphoria, approaches woody.}
<C>__{slinky}
<D>__{heh, heh, heh! golly bob howdy }
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{oh, shut up! in a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was. they'll see... they'll see. i'm still andy's favorite toy.}
