<L>__{3.52 interior e3 council house evening}
<A>__{in the kitchen diner: jaden, austen and their dad: paul (50s). paul says a prayer before they eat their corner shop meal. jaden's hands are together in respect for paul. austen deliberately pays no attention to the ritual at all.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{. . . for this gift of daily bread we thank thee oh lord. . .}
<A>__{jaden throws austen a look. mean and fierce. and now suddenly we see what he's capable of. fear overcomes austen's arrogance. he puts his hands together and closes his eyes.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{. . . and for the gift of these fine sons i thank thee oh lord. . .}
<A>__{the crucifix on the wall. christ's tormented face in the cheap shadows of this dull, crappy kitchen. it's all paul has.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{. . . beseech thee to look down on them and protect them with thy everlasting mercy . . .}
<A>__{seeing jaden's eyes now closed in prayer for pauls' sake austen can't resist feeling the wad of new cash in his pocket.}
