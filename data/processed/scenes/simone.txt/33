<L>__{exterior viktor's malibu house morning}
<A>__{boats are moored just off the beach packed dangerously full of telephoto lens toting photographers. the next door houses have lenses protruding through the drapes of the windows. viktor strides onto the lawn of his property that backs onto the beach, soaking up the attention unable to resist waving extravagantly. suddenly, a photographer, losing his balance, drops from a nearby rooftop. the photographer limps towards the fence. viktor calmly follows, retrieving the photographer's camera and ripping out the film with a flourish he is clearly relishing the attention. the photographer clambers over the fence where he joins several dozen other shutter bugs and videorazzi.}
<C>__{photographer 1}
<D>__{that wasn't her, taransky.}
<C>__{echo photographer}
<D>__{where is she? you can't hide her forever.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(hurling the camera into the mob)}
<D>__{you'll never find her. simone only appears when i want her to appear.}
<A>__{max sayer from "the national echo" is at the head of the mob, accompanied by assistant milton.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{she sounds like a prisoner, taransky. are you holding her hostage? are you some kind of svengali?}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(recognizing the reporter)}
<D>__{who's the hostage, sayer, her or you? you look kind of "captive" yourself. while you're spending every waking hour obsessing over simone, guess what, i guarantee she doesn't even know you exist. get off my property or i will call the cops.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{the cops? the cops read my column to know who to bust. we're the only watchdog the public has.}
<P>__{(looking around at the photographers)}
<D>__{none of this is going away. we'll be here tomorrow and the day after that. until you slip up. and you will. you are looking at your shadow.}
<P>__{(getting in his face)}
<D>__{because all these elaborate precautions with simone every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{i'm just trying to help you, sayer. i don't want you to be disappointed. it gets cold out here at night.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{nice try. if we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co operative. i can guarantee you, taransky, one way or another, miss simone and i are going to get acquainted.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(turning away)}
<D>__{i'd like to see that, sayer. invite me.}
