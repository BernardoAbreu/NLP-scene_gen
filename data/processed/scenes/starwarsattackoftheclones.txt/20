<L>__{exterior senate apartments entrance night}
<A>__{anakin charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked speeders. he vaults into an open one and takes off, gunning it fast toward the lines of speeder traffic high above.}
<L>__{exterior cityscape, coruscant night}
<A>__{the droid bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the jedi loose. it moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. it takesthe jedi wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as obi wan is forced to lift his legs, tenaciously hanging onto the droid. the droid heads for a dirty, beat up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up. when the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy bounty hunter called zam wesell, sees the droid approach with obi wan hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the jedi. explosions burst all around obi wan.}
<D>__{obi wan i have a bad feeling about this.}
<A>__{finally, the droid suffers a direct hit and blows up. obi wan falls fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit. the jedi struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open speeder and sit down next to the driver, anakin.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{that was wacky! i almost lost you in the traffic. obi wan what took you so long?}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{oh, you know, master, i couldn't find a speeder i really liked, with an open cockpit... and with the right speed capabilities... and then you know i had to get a really gonzo color...}
<A>__{they zoom upward in hot pursuit of zam asshe fires out the open window at them with her laser pistol.}
<D>__{obi wan if you'd spend as much time working on your saber skills as you do on your wit, young padawan, you would rival master yoda as a swordsman.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i thought i already did. obi wan only in your mind, my very young apprentice. careful!! hey, easy!!}
<A>__{as this conversation is going on, anakin deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic, across lanes, between buildings, and miraculously through a construction site. zam wesell continues firing at them.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{sorry, i forgot you don't like flying, master. obi wan i don't mind flying... but what you're doing is suicide!}
<A>__{they barely miss a commuter train}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{master, you know i've been flying since before i could walk. i'm very good at this. obi wan just slow down!}
<A>__{zam wessel and the jedi race through a line of cross traffic made up of giant trucks. the speeders bank sideways as they slide around right angle turns between buildings. zam races into a tram tunnel.}
<D>__{obi wan}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{wait! don't go in there!}
<A>__{anakin zooms into the tunnel after zam. they see a tram coming at them. they brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the charging commuter transport.}
<D>__{obi wan}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you know i don't like it when you do that!}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{sorry, master. don't worry, this guy's gonna kill himself any minute now!}
<A>__{zam wessel turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the jedi off. oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid zam and the jedi. zam does a quick, tight loop over and ends up behind the jedi. she is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. to avoid being hit by the laser bolts, anakin slams on the brakes and moves alongside zam. she now fires point blank at obi wan.}
<D>__{obi wan what are you doing? he's gonna blast me!}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{right this isn't working.}
<A>__{anakin slides underneath zam's speeder. they race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. the bounty hunter skims over the rooftops, causing anakin to drop behind. anakin goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. they race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. a large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. they round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops.}
<D>__{obi wan that was too close!}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{clear that! obi wan what??}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{clear the flag! we're losing power! hurry!}
<A>__{obi wan leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop. the speeder lurches forward with a surge of power.}
<D>__{obi wan whooooaaa! don't do that! i don't like it when you do that!}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{so sorry, master.}
<A>__{they chase the bounty hunter through a power refinery.}
<D>__{obi wan it's dangerous near those power couplings! slow down! don't go through there!}
<A>__{huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass.}
<D>__{obi wan}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{yiiii, what are you doing?}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{sorry, master! obi wan}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<D>__{oh, that was good...}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{that was crazy!!!}
<A>__{zam slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point blank as anakin approaches.}
<C>__{anakin}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ahh, damn. obi wan stop!!}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{no, we can make it.}
<A>__{anakin barely misses the bounty hunter's speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control. anakin struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts. a giant gasball shoots up, causing anakin to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder.}
<D>__{obi wan i'm crazy... i'm crazy... i'm crazy.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{but it worked... we made it. obi wan}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{it didn't work... we've stalled! and you almost got us killed!}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i think we're still alive.}
<A>__{anakin works to get the speeder started. it quickly races to life.}
<D>__{obi wan}
<P>__{(very angrily)}
<D>__{it was stupid!}
<C>__{anakin}
<P>__{(sheepishly)}
<D>__{i could have made it... obi wan}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{but you didn't!!! and now we've lost him.}
<A>__{suddenly, there is an ambush. laser bolts fire everywhere. explosions surround them. they look up to see zam wessel take off.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{no we didnt...}
<A>__{out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the jedi tear after zam. they are smoking. obi wan slaps out the small fire on the dashboard. zam goes up and down, through cross traffic. there is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. zam turns down and left between two buildings. anakin pulls up and to the right}
<D>__{obi wan where are you going?! he went down there, the other way.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{this is a shortcut... i think. obi wan what do you mean, you think? what kind of shortcut?! he went completely the other way! youve lost him!}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{master, if we keep this chase going, that creeps gonna end up deep fried. personally, id very much like to find out who in the hell he is and who hes working for... obi wan}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{oh, so thats why were going in the wrong direction.}
<A>__{anakin turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up.}
<D>__{obi wan}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{well, you lost him.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{im deeply sorry, master.}
<A>__{anakin looks around front and back. he spots something. he seems to start counting to himself as he watches something below approach.}
<C>__{anakin}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{excuse me for a moment.}
<A>__{anakin jumps out of the speeder. obi wan looks down and sees zams speeder about five stories below them cruising past. anakin miraculously lands on top of the bounty hunters speeder. the speeder wobbles under the impact. zam looks up and realises what has happened. zam takes off, and anakin slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on. anakin works his way back to the speeders cockpit, just as zam stops suddenly, and anakin flies forward to the left front fork. zam shoots at him with a laser pistol. there is a blast near anakin's hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. anakin slides to the right fork of the speeder, where zam cant reach him. he scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop. obi wan has jumped into the drivers seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. the two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. finally, anakin is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. zam takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless jedi, knocking the sword out of his hand. obi wan races under the speeder and catches the jedi weapon in the passengers seat. anakin sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the force, pulls the gun out of zams hand. she grabs the jedis hand, and they struggle for the weapon. it goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. the speeder careens wildly out of control. zam struggles to pull the speeder out of its nose dive. obi wan gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the bounty hunters speeder. just as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground, zam pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. anakin goes flying into the street.}
