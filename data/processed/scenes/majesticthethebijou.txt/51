<A>__{eldridge's car rounds the corner, pulls up and stops.}
<C>__{eldridge}
<D>__{here we are.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well, son, you're home!}
<A>__{luke peers across the street... his mouth gapes open... his pov the bijou. the bijou is a decaying, dada esque, grab bag of building styles. it's as though the architect took random parts of a chinese temple, a mosque, a pagoda, a sphinx, a symphony hall and a slaughterhouse, put them in a bag, gave it a good shake, tossed the contents out onto a blueprint and promptly built the result. as a matter of fact, if you didn't know that the place was "the bijou," you'd probably wonder what the cryptic message}
<D>__{" he b j u"}
<A>__{was trying to convey from atop the crumbling parapet. and now, the reason for the deteriorated state of the " he b j u" sign becomes apparent. train tracks run right behind the building on an elevated trestle. as we watch, a train roars by. everything shakes. it's not an earthquake, it's a trainquake. the "j" teeters at a jaunty angle, threatening to dislodge and tumble down to join its fallen brothers.}
<B>__{luke}
<A>__{stares at the monstrosity. his face is ashen. his heart has sunk to somewhere below his knees. the bijou. harry jumps out of the car excitedly.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{thanks for the lift, cecil.}
<C>__{eldridge}
<D>__{don't mention it. welcome home, luke.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(faint smile)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{luke opens the back door and slowly steps out. harry grabs his arm and pulls a ring of keys from his pocket.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{wait'll you see the inside!}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{can't wait.}
