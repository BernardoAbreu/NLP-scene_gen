<C>__{councillor mulligan}
<D>__{master roderick, you appear a young fellow of birth and fortune; let me whisper in your ear that you have fallen into very bad hands it's a regular gang of swindlers; and a gentleman of your rank and quality should never be seen in such company. the captain has been a gentleman's gentleman, and his lady of no higher rank. go home, pack your valise, pay the little trifle you owe me, mount your mare, and ride back again to your parents it's the very best thing you can do.}
