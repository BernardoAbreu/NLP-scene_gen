<A>__{the front door opens, and michael enters his own home. it is very quiet, no one is at home to greet him. he can see the evidence of his family; things his wife and his children have been using, and left on a sofa or a table. he moves toward his and kay's bedroom, where we can hear the sound of a sewing machine running. quietly he opens the door. michael's view into the bedroom. kay is sitting by the window, lit by the cold afternoon light, at work with her sewing machine. she hasn't noticed that he's in the room yet, and goes on with her work.}
