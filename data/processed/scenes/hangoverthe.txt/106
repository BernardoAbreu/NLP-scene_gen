<B>__{vick delicately laying cash inside his duffel bag}
<A>__{on top of his dirty clothing, fruitlessly trying to create the appearance of a bag full of money. he's using some $20 bills, but also some $5's and $1's.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{this all the cash we got?}
<A>__{the guys frown at their empty wallets, yeah. we are}
<L>__{interior vick's car exterior mojave desert dawn}
<A>__{the caddy is parked next to mile marker 26 in the middle of the windy desert. the las vegas skyline is just barely visible in the distance. vick very delicately zips up his duffel bag so as not to disturb the bills, and places it on his lap.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{this is the dumbest plan ever.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{alan i need you positive please.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{here they come.}
<A>__{they all look up to see a white yukon approaching on the far horizon, kicking up a trail of dust. the guys tense up.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{stuart?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{there's an emergency bottle of tequila in my glove box. get it out please.}
<A>__{stu opens the glovebox, pulls out a bottle of patron. he opens it, takes a swig, then passes it to vick, who takes a pull and passes it to alan, who also drinks. they all watch the white yukon draw ever closer.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{i can't believe this is how we're going to die...}
<A>__{the yukon pulls up about ten yards away. no one moves. the yukon's doors open... the cadillac's doors open... tight on the jimmy lang's red boot as it hits the road... tight on vick's leather shoe, then alan's sailing topsider, then stu's flip flop, as they all hit the dusty road... the two parties stand by their respective cars, facing off. somewhere in the desert, a rattlesnake rattles.}
<C>__{jimmy lang}
<D>__{let's see the money!}
<A>__{vick gently holds up his duffel bag.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{let's see doug!}
<A>__{jimmy lang nods to kalolo, who opens the back door of the yukon and pulls out a guy with his hands tied behind his back and a plastic ralph's bag over his head; he struggles a bit. the guys look a bit alarmed.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{jesus, what'd they do to him?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{pull off the ralph's bag!}
<A>__{jimmy yanks the bag off of the guy's head to reveal it's not doug it's some black dude. vick, stu, and alan look confused.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{who the hell is that?!}
<C>__{jimmy lang}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{this is doug!}
<A>__{he pushes the guy forward.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{oh my god: it's the other doug! roger's friend, the cake designer!}
<C>__{black doug}
<P>__{(to jimmy lang)}
<D>__{i told you, man, i'm doug howland! i barely even know these guys!}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{yeah, you got the wrong doug, man!}
<A>__{jimmy lang and the thugs look exasperated.}
<C>__{jimmy lang}
<D>__{you sure?!}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{yeah, man, our doug is white!}
<C>__{jimmy lang}
<D>__{but you were partying with this guy at my birthday thing!}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{i don't know what to tell you, bro, this isn't the doug we requested!}
<C>__{jimmy lang}
<D>__{well. i apologize for the mix up...}
<P>__{(drawing his huge gun)}
<D>__{but i'm still gonna need my money.}
<A>__{vick and the guys start backtracking towards their car.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{oh my god oh my god oh my god...}
<C>__{jimmy lang}
<D>__{don't move, vick.}
<A>__{vick freezes, duffel in hand, as stu and alan slink from view. jimmy reaches vick, gun calmly trained at his head.}
<C>__{jimmy lang }
<D>__{now please. give me my money.}
<A>__{all eyes on vick, anxiously clutching the bag in his hand... sweat beads on his brow...}
<C>__{jimmy lang }
<D>__{don't be stupid, son. you }
<A>__{then vick throws a hard left hook, slamming jimmy square in his massive stomach! and}
<B>__{nothing happens}
<A>__{jimmy is built like a tank. vick freezes, oh shit. then jimmy pistol whips vick his lip explodes with blood and he falls to the ground.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{christ that hurts!}
<A>__{then jimmy picks up the duffel bag. hefts it. feels wrong. he goes to open the zipper when he hears:}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{aaaaaaahhhhhhh!}
<A>__{jimmy looks up to see stu insanely charging him like the linebacker he once was! jimmy raises his gun, but stu tackles jimmy to the ground first! the gun flies free and they wrestle for it! dust flies!}
<B>__{back by the yukon}
<A>__{the two guamians fumble for their guns but it's difficult with huge casts on their shooting hands!}
<B>__{on black doug}
<A>__{he sees what's going down, and, his hands tied behind his back, takes off sprinting towards vegas!}
<B>__{by the caddilac}
<A>__{alan looks around, what should i do?! what should i do?! then he spots the keys in the ignition of the car. he hops in and fires up the engine! just then}
<B>__{the two guamians open fire}
<A>__{bullets pound into the cadillac! alan ducks down, terrified, and floors the gas!}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{i'm being shot at! i'm being shot at!}
<B>__{up ahead}
<A>__{jimmy lang throws stu off of him and recovers his gun, panting. he cocks it, aims it at stu on the ground.}
<C>__{jimmy lang}
<D>__{i really didn't want to kill anyone today }
<A>__{then wham! alan drives the car into jimmy lang at 25mph! the obese mobster is pitched off his feet, and lands a good ten yards away, in a heap of dust! the guys freeze, shocked. the guamians freeze, shocked.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{oh my god, is he okay?!}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{who cares! go go!}
<A>__{alan floors the car while stu and vick sprint and dive in! the caddy peels the hell out of there, kicking up rocks and dust! the guamians fire after them!}
<B>__{bullets impact all all over car}
<A>__{taking out the tail lights, the windshield, the headrests. the guys duck down til they're sufficiently far away. then they sit up, amazed, out of breath.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i can't believe you just saved my life!}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{i can't believe you just drove my car into jimmy lang!}
<A>__{alan drives, his eyes as big as saucers.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{he's gonna be really upset!}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{yeah, i was just thinking that!}
<B>__{back on jimmy lang}
<A>__{the huge mobster lies face down on the desert floor. his two henchmen waddle up, highly concerned.}
<C>__{kikiolani}
<D>__{boss, boss, you okay?!}
<A>__{jimmy sputters into the dirt, furious.}
<C>__{jimmy lang}
<D>__{find vick... and kill him.}
