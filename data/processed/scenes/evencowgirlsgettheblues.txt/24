<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{rupert is helping julian to the street. rupert is a salesman for a publishing house. his wife carla, a homemaker, as they say. the other couple breaks down into howard and marie barth, both copywriters for an ad agency. howard hails a cab and carla and marie flutter around sissy.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{this is dreadful.}
<P>__{(lowering her voice confidentially)}
<D>__{you know, asthma attacks are brought on by emotional stress. poor julian is so high strung. the excitement of meeting you my dear, you look so stunning! must have upset his chemical balance.}
<A>__{carla nods. everyone is piling into the taxi.}
<C>__{rupert}
<D>__{come on, sissy, don't be afraid of us.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{i've never ridden in a cab. the whole idea of paying for a ride makes my thumbs hurt.}
<A>__{sissy is forced to suffer the indignity of riding in a vehicle she wasn't responsible for flagging with her own thumbs.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{it'll be all right, dear. it isn't as serious as it sounds.}
