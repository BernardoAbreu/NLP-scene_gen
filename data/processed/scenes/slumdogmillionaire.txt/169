<A>__{a cheek scarred by disfiguring knife scars. pulling back we see it is latika, staring frozen at jamal on the television news. a palatial living room. dealing cards to salim, is javed khan. a couple of bar girls giggle next to javed and a couple of his thugs. pouring drinks at a sideboard is latika. javed glances up at the screen, clearly not recognising jamal on a clip from who wants to be a millionaire. salim, too is staring, wide eyed at the tv. javed picks up the remote, doesn't even notice and switches over to a music channel. latika hurries out.}

<D>__{what about my bloody whisky, woman?}
<A>__{but she has already gone. he growls after her.}
<C>__{javed }
<D>__{hey, salim.}
<A>__{he motions salim to get him a drink. javed's mobile rings as salim goes over to the sideboard. shifts a bottle to the back.}

<D>__{we're out. i will just get syed.}
