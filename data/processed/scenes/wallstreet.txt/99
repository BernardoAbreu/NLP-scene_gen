<A>__{they're finishing lunch by the pool framed by a lush flower garden where kate and son rudy play. harold salt, gekko's chief lawyer, thick glasses, smart eyes and bags of worry that could only come from watching other people's money, looks very city like in his clothing, examining his paperwork before passing it to bud, who is the picture of relaxation.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{...you understand mr. gekko is constantly barraged with nuisance litigation and irs audits.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{...so it's in both our interests to put a safe distance between you and us...}
<P>__{(passing a document with a 2nd pen)}
<D>__{...this gives you limited power of attorney for mr. gekko's account. every trade you make is at your discretion. every ticket you buy must be marked "power of attorney." that means you call the shots and mr. gekko has no official knowledge of what stocks you're buying. sign here and here...}
<A>__{buddy looks, then up to gekko, who smiles, casual.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{...just the beginning, sport, just the begining...}
<A>__{bud smiles, signs.}

<D>__{...you understand if any problems arise, you're out there on your own. the trail stops with you...}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{all's fair in love and war.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{the art of which is deception. spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...}

<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{rudy, viens ici, dit bonjour a monsieur bud.}
<A>__{rudy either says "no!" or "bonjour monsieur bud!' depending on the mood of the kid. gordon sweeping him up and playing with him. the kid squeals with glee.}
<C>__{gekko}

<D>__{already speaks a little french, kid got the highest score on his iq test.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(to darien)}
<D>__{...it's so tough to get into a good nursery school now. they even visit your home to make sure your paintings and furnishings are acceptable.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{what's it cost these days?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{$5,000 just for the tuition... plus the books and supplies...}
<P>__{(with a look to gordon)}
<D>__{...some parents even have bodyguards. it's not a bad idea...}
<P>__{(picking up rudy)}
<D>__{...now that's it for you with the grown ups young man.}
<A>__{as rudy smashes the strawberries around his face and resists going. "no! no!" kate exasperated gives the child to nicole.}
<C>__{kate}

<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{he doesn't nap anymore, madame. it's been...}
<C>__{kate}

<P>__{(to bud and gordon)}
<D>__{black clothes are the newest things, so chic and milk stains, carrot juice stains just don't show up. kids boy, can they take it out of you!}
<A>__{nicole's "oui, madame" is lost in the wrestling match she goes through to drag him out screaming. kate walking off. harold gives buddy another piece of paper...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{this is a contact at one of our banks. on settlement day you'll open an account there for mr. gekko under the name of geneva, roth holding corp. then you'll wire transfer the money to this account in the cayman islands...}
<C>__{gekko}
<P>__{(rising, finished with lunch)}
<D>__{think about incorporating yourself there, bud, harold will take care of it for you.}
<P>__{(with a look to harold)}
