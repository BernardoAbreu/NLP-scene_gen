<L>__{exterior motel day}
<A>__{the same mountains in b.g. as at the track. lilly carries two small bags from her motel room, puts them on the back seat of the cadillac, gets behind the wheel, drives away.}
<L>__{interior bathroom day}
<A>__{myra, dressed, primps at the mirror, surveys herself critically, is reasonably satisfied, leaves.}
<L>__{interior bedroom day}
<A>__{roy lies supine on the bed, semi conscious, half covered by a sheet. myra, casual, not noticing his condition, leans her head in through the doorway.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{wore you out, did i? it's a good woman you can't keep down, baby.}
<A>__{he moves fitfully, croaks an attempt at speech.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{have a good sleep, baby. call you tomorrow.}
<A>__{he sits up, trying to grin and be easy.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{wait'll next year.}
<A>__{an angle across roy's profile, with open bedroom door beyond him. through it, the living room and outer door can be seen. myra crosses the living room, opens the door. bright sunlight pours in, emphasizing the sweat on his face. she closes the door, and he gives up trying to smile. gingerly, he touches his bruised stomach, winces.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{damn that guy.}
<A>__{he's going to get out of bed, but movement creates pain. he sits back against the headboard, looks around, reaches painfully to the bedside table drawer, takes a quarter from it, studies the quarter, feels it with fingertips, places it on the back of his left hand, slowly moves the soft pads of his right palm over it, then turns the quarter over and repeats. then he takes the quarter in his right hand, flips it, slaps it down onto the back of his left hand, speaks simultaneously with the hands coming together.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{smack.}
<A>__{he looks away, right hand moving minimally on left hand.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{heads.}
<A>__{he lifts the right hand, nods, then flips the coin again, looks away, moves the right hand slightly.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{heads.}
<A>__{again he's right. again he repeats.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{tails.}
<A>__{he's about to repeat when a wave of weakness comes over him. he sits back, gasping, but won't acknowledge the problem. he forces himself to flip the coin, misses catching it, finds it on the blanket, flips it again, slaps it onto the back of the other hand, looks away.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{tails.}
<A>__{right again. he prepares to flip the coin, but then his hand sags onto the covers, his chin drops, his eyes glaze.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{how much can i bet?}
