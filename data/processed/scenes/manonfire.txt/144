<L>__{exterior via buenos aires mexico city day}
<A>__{scene of the crime. typical mexican 'roadside shrines' where the policemen fell. a pyre of flowers where pinta was scooped up, creasy's blood still staining the sidewalk alongside. a car pulls up... rosanna guerrero gets out with a reporter and photographer. she directs them in spanish. the reporter starts making notes; the photographer snaps photos of the shrine. rosanna stands by the flower pyre. something catches her eye. a balled up piece of paper and a half burned candle beside it. as she picks it up, she spots something else. across the street, creasy walks. an awkward hitch in his stride. outside the apartment of the piano teacher, surveying the scene with experienced eyes. unaware of rosanna creasy (flashback) corolla. muzzle flashes. pinta screaming...}
