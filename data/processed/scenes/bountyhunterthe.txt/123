<C>__{milo}

<C>__{cass}
<P>__{(under her breath)}

<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i'm saying i don't need your help.}
<C>__{cass}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{as he turns away, she slips the matchbook into her purse. milo catches this movement out of the corner of his eye and glances back:}

<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{cass}
<P>__{(innocently)}
<D>__{what was what?}

<D>__{drop the weapon, now!}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{take it easy. i'm just gonna unload it.}
<A>__{milo drops the cartridge, then tosses the gun right at the guard's face. the guard instinctively raises his hands and milo charges him, tackling him to the ground, then handcuffing him to the table. milo grabs cass hand and races from the room.}
