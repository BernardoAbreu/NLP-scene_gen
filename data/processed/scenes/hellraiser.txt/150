<L>__{interior torture room day}
<A>__{he pushes her ahead of him, into the torture room. he closes the door.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you've grown. you're beautiful.}
<A>__{she has retreated as far from him as she can get. he advances on her.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{don't touch me. or so help me }
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what? what will you do? what can you do?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{there's nothing to be frightened of.}
<A>__{frank has closed in on her by now. he lakes hold of her face.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i bet you make your daddy proud, don't you? beautiful.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{this isn't happening.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i used to tell myself that. used to try and pretend i was dreaming all the pain. but why kid yourself? some things have to be endured. take it from me. and that makes the pleasures so much sweeter ...}
<A>__{as he leans in to kiss her she snatches hold of the pus and bloodstained shirt that's glued to his abdomen, and pulls. there's a flow of fluids. frank's head is thrown back, and he screams. she slips from beneath his grasp. but he's after her in a moment, his hand catching her blouse. it tears. his fingers rake her bare skin. she stumbles, reaches out for the wall, which is slick with sykes' blood. her hand slides over it. she falls, heavily. roaring, frank comes in pursuit of her. on the floor in front of kirsty: the box. it's a poor weapon, but it's all she's got. as he comes after her again, she stands up and delivers a blow to his head with the box. he howls. she races for the door. but he's after her. he strikes her. she's thrown against the wall. he's furious now. strikes her again. she cannot survive much more. she raises the box to retaliate. frank sees what she's holding. his attack stops.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{give that to me.}
<A>__{she dimly realizes that she has a bargaining tool.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(breathless)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{one last time. give me the box.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{you want it?}
<A>__{the monster's eyes glitter.}
<D>__{fucking have it!}
<A>__{she throws the box. it sails past frank and smashes through the window.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{he goes to the window. she takes her chance. she's out of the door in a moment.}
<D>__{no!}
