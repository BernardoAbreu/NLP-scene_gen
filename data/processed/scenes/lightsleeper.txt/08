<D>__{here.}
<A>__{john accepts a coffee mug, sits on a sofa across from teresa. sunlight falls through crocheted curtains. teresa aronow, fortyish, professionally young, is compact, demure; she wears business jacket and skirt, patterned blouse. nothing about her is remotely paranormal nothing except, of course, her "aura." the "other side." her voice is at the same time soothing, piercing. teresa's west village consultation room is startlingly mundane: a bourgeois walk up. upholstered furniture, tiffany objets d'art, framed photos of her husband and children a trip to capri. a twenties portrait of madame blavatsky, above the fireplace, centers the room.}
