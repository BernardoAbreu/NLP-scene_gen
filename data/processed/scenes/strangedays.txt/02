<A>__{but we don't know where we are yet. we see a man in extreme close up: just his eyes and mouth. the eyes are closed, the eyeballs tracking under the lids, like he is watching a movie in there. this is lenny.}

<D>__{this is great... the doors are all locked. who are these losers, friends of yours?}

<A>__{back to pov as we reach the fifth floor landing. lane is coming unglued as he finds this door locked. we look down, see cops coming two floors below. one cranks off a couple rounds at us and we snap back from the railing. pounding up the last flight. finally! the door is unlocked. blasting through it, behind lane, onto the roof. running all out past ac units and pipes, air vents. looking up: an lapd helicopter orbiting close. it flicks the xenon onto us and we are running in a vibrating circle of blue daylight. running along the edge of the roof. looking down. car burning upside down in the street below. the gas tank explodes, filling the street with orange light. we don't slow. we're running all out.}
<C>__{lenny }
<D>__{wow... the gas tank is a nice touch. oh, oh, end of the line boys.}
<A>__{ahead, in pov we see the edge of the roof coming up. beyond it is another building, about ten feet lower and separated by a 20 foot alley. but lane doesn't slow down. he leaps across the void and makes it to the other building, landing in a sprawl. we reach the edge and look down. six stories. no ladders or fire escapes. whip to behind us. cops running across the roof.}
<C>__{lane}
<D>__{come on! fucking jump man!}
<A>__{the pov backs up from the edge and then runs toward it... out into the void. moving... airborne... then... wham! right into the parapet wall. slipping down. brick wall right in our face. bloody fingers grabbing for a rusty piece of pipe running along the edge. looking down... feet dangling over a sixty foot drop. a cat walking through a patch of light in the alley below, oblivious. breathing raspy. snapping a look up as the pipe gives way. a keening whine coming from us as we scramble to climb up but... snapping a look down walls rushing past, sound of wind, and our own raspy scream ground rushing up split second impression of a cat, looking up, yowling and running out of the way as pavement fills frame. a burst of violent red light. sound like a gunshot... but no echo. only silence. and blackness.}
