<A>__{tight on jack and marcie as they make love under a camp blanket. their breathing and noises are heard just above the sounds of the rain outside. the camera becomes interested in a droplet which appear to have leaked from the ceiling, hit the vertical member of the bed and dribbled down. as the bed shakes with its love making, the camera pans up the bunk's strut to trace the droplet's course. as the camera pans upward, it pulls back slightly and we see ned lying in the upper bunk. in a flash of lightning we realize he is dead: his throat has been slashed. another angle: jack and marcie lie completely still beneath their blanket. the camera pans along their quiet bodies. marcie's face is contented. jack is ready to doze off.}
