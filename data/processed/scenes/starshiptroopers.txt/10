<L>__{interior biology lab day the biology teacher}
<A>__{is an older woman, very spry, also blind. johnny, carmen and other students gather around covered lab tables.}
<C>__{biology teacher}
<D>__{for our final today, please identify the mouthparts, the abdominal organs, and for extra credit, locate the nerve cord and count the ganglia. you may begin.}
<A>__{the students remove the cover to reveal large alien bugs, 60 centimeter arkellian sand beetles laid out for dissection.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{eeuch !}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.}
<C>__{biology teacher}
<D>__{just a bug, eh ? we humans like to think we are nature's finest achievement. i'm afraid it isn't true. this arkellian sand beetle is superior in many ways. it has fewer moving parts, can reproduce itself in vast numbers, and unboud by concerns of ego and mortality, makes the perfect selfless member of society.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{better put your goggles on.}
<A>__{johnny slices the abdomen open with asurgical laser. green fluid sprays from the slit. carmen turns away looking ill.}
<C>__{biology teacher}
<D>__{our galaxy is teaming with insect life. we have identified over two billion species so far. human, life, it would seem, is the anomaly.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{but we 're intelligent. human minds have invented art, mathematics and interstellar travel.}
<C>__{biology teacher}
<D>__{true, we know of no insect society that has produced a shakespeare, an einstein or a cherynkov, but before you let that go to your head, take the example of the arachnids, a highly organized, highly evolved insect society.}
<A>__{she points to an insect evolution chart that starts with a common ant and ends with a two meter tall arachnid warrior.}
<C>__{biology teacher}
<D>__{they are relatively stupid by human standards. workers have an iq of 12, warriors around 35 , and yet the arachnids have colonized planets. over a million years of evolution, nature has provided the arachnids with the biological means to hurl their spore into space.}
<A>__{johnny applies a spreader and jacks the insects abdominal cavity open with aresounding crack. bug guts gush out.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{excuse me...!}
<A>__{she heads for the door, hand over her mouth.}
