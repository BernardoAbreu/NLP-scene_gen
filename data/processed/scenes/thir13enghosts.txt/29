<A>__{outside the main structure is an entryway, with an inner and outer door, almost like an airlock. arthur produces the odd key and slips it into the keyhole. the locking mechanism, visible within the glass, beckons. arthur turns the key. as it turns, we hear the mechanism click and whir. then, oddly, the key is sucked into the keyhole, and vanishes. everyone looks at the now empty keyhole, then at each other, then back at the keyhole.}
