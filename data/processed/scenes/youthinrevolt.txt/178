<L>__{interior joanie's apartment day}
<A>__{joanie opens the door and finds nick on her doorstep.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{uh, hi, joanie. how's it going?}
<C>__{joanie}
<D>__{nick?}
<L>__{interior joanie's apartment later}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{since my sister can see through me, i'm obliged to give a relatively candid and thorough review of the events.}
<A>__{joanie listens gravely, shaking her head at the most gruesome parts of the story. nick finishes, flopping into a chair.}
<C>__{joanie}
<D>__{nick, six months ago you were just another brownnosing honor student. what happened?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i'm not really sure. i fell in love with sheeni. all i want is to be with her. the rest is all a big misunderstanding.}
<C>__{joanie}
<D>__{nick, you've stolen, vandalized, trespassed, and burned down berkeley. all for one girl. if there's a misunderstanding, it's with your insight into females.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{but... but where did i go wrong?}
<C>__{joanie}
<D>__{nick, boys your age are always looking for the path of least resistance to becoming a man. a boy's whole self esteem rests on how fast he can get a girl into bed.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{so far, i agree.}
<C>__{joanie}
<D>__{sooner or later what those boys realize, is that the girls you're chasing base their self esteem on how many hoops they can get the boy to jump through before going to bed with him.}
<A>__{nick furrows his brow. clearly that had not occurred to him.}
<C>__{joanie}
<D>__{so i guess what you should ask yourself is: how far are you willing to go?}
<A>__{nick nods in understanding. an epiphanic smile.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{all the way, joanie. i'm willing to go all the way.}
<A>__{joanie nods in amusement.}
<C>__{joanie}
<D>__{you can stay here a couple days, but eventually they'll come looking for you. i don't have much money to give you, but here.}
<A>__{nick takes the wad of cash, clearly moved.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{thanks, joanie. i... uh... i love you.}
<C>__{joanie}
<D>__{i love you too, you little brat.}
