<ACTION>__{A garbage truck roars by and... Simon Grim hangs from the back of it. He is a shy, skinny and terrified-looking guy around thirty years old. The truck rumbles to a halt and Simon climbs down off it to go punch out at the time clock.}
<LOC>__{EXT. BEHIND THE WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{Moments later. He comes walking up a small alley and sits to drink his beer. He begins to relax. This is his quality private time. Then he hears something and looks up. He peeks up over the edge of some junked kitchen appliances and sees... Two teenage kids -- Warren and Amy -- smoking crack and having sex. Simon looks on, intrigued, as Warren smokes, then...}
<CHAR>__{WARREN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Amy)}
<DIAL>__{You want some?}
<ACTION>__{Amy takes the pipe and smokes as he feels her up. Simon is fascinated. He drinks and looks on as... Amy grins up foolishly at Warren and lowers the pipe. The boy undoes his belt and hikes up the girl's skirt. Simon can't believe this. He looks around to see if the coast is clear, then returns just in time to see... Warren takes Amy by the waist and enter her. The pipe falls from the young girl's hand. Warren throws his head back and grinds himself into her. Simon's mouth falls open in awe. But Amy tosses her head back to the side and sees... The amazed garbage man; caught. Amy starts screaming insanely. Simon runs for his life. Amy and Warren throw rocks and bottles at him as they chase him away.}

<ACTION>__{Moments later. Simon runs up and throws open the screen door. He stands there in the doorway catching his breath. His sister, Fay, is at the kitchen table watching a small portable TV while their mother, Mary, sits a few feet away in the living-room watching another TV tuned to a different channel.}

<DIAL>__{I don't know why you cooked! I don't know why you bother!}
<ACTION>__{Fay holds her head in her hands and sighs. She glares at her brother.}
<CHAR>__{FAY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sit down and eat, Simon.}
<ACTION>__{Simon sits at the table and Fay slams down before him a bowl of some sort of gruel. He hesitates, then lifts his spoon. Supper is horrible and he screws up his face in disgust. Fay gives him a sideways glance and he leans back down over the bowl and eats some more. Pushing the bowl away gently, he reaches out for the container of milk on the table and drinks straight from it. He suddenly jumps back and spits out sour milk all over the table. The container drops to the floor and thick globs of cheese roll out. He stands back against the fridge, holding his stomach while... Fay and Mary look on in disgust.}
<LOC>__{EXT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{Moments later. Simon crosses the lawn and sits on the curb outside his house. He stares at the ground before him as he holds his stomach and spits, sickened. He looks up, though, and sees... A little seven-year-old girl -- Pearl age seven -- standing there in the street watching him. Simon tries to smile at her. But she throws a rock at him and hits him in the head. He falls forward, hurt, as the little girl runs away. Lowering his hand, he sees he's bleeding. Desperate, lonely and ill, he drags his bloodied fingers across the coarse pavement. Fay slams out of the side door of the house in a tight-fitting dress and stands on the lawn, applying lipstick.}
<CHAR>__{FAY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{God, I wanna get fucked.}
<ACTION>__{Fay snaps shut her compact, straightens her skirt and sighs.}
<CHAR>__{FAY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You OK?}
<ACTION>__{Simon loses track of what he is hearing and relaxes. He looks back at his sister. Fay fluffs out her hair and walks off.}
<CHAR>__{FAY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{See ya later.}
<ACTION>__{Simon watches her go, but is still drawn to something he seems to hear up the street in the other direction. He cocks his head, sits perfectly still and listens. He hears it now. We do, too. Footsteps. Big ones. Like a giant somewhere in the distance. The neighborhood trembles. Titles begin. Simon tries to figure out where it's coming from; the sky, the house, the highway at the end of his block... Finally, he focuses on... The blacktop right before him, smeared with his own blood. Music starts. He kneels out slowly into the street and stares at the pavement. He stretches out his hand and places it flat on the road. The pounding is louder now, becoming the beat of the music over the scene. Simon lowers his face to the pavement, closes his eyes and... Puts his ear right down against the road. He hears... The steady tread of somebody very much larger than life. Kneeling forward, with his ear to the ground, Simon opens his eyes and sees... A man approaching. The music swells up full. Simon lifts his head slowly from the road, looking off in wonder at... This stranger coming towards him; an oddly handsome freak striding over the crest of the distant intersection with a windswept mane, two over-stuffed suitcases and a crumpled tie fluttering back over his broad but crooked shoulders. Simon rises till he's kneeling up straight in the road. Henry Fool finally reaches him and stops. Titles finish. Simon says nothing and watches as Henry looks off at the house. Satisfied, but wary, Henry Fool looks around the neighborhood and then down at Simon.}
<CHAR>__{HENRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Get up off your knees.}
<ACTION>__{He tosses the suitcases down in front of Simon and walks off towards his new home.}
<LOC>__{EXT. BACK OF THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{Henry comes around behind the house and finds the door to his basement apartment. He approaches. Simon follows, carrying the suitcases.}
<LOC>__{INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{Moments later. The door is wrenched open and Henry is hit square in the jaw by a decade of dank airless gloom. He coughs. Entering, he finds a few old wooden chairs littering the main room. He inspects the old wood stove, then takes a chair and smashes it. He tosses the wood in the stove. Simon looks on, amazed. Henry lights a fire with unusually quick results, then stands back and looks at Simon.}
<CHAR>__{HENRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Where you gotta go to get a six-pack of beer around here?}
<LOC>__{INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{This is a convenience store with a number of tables at which to eat donuts. Warren is shoplifting while Amy terrorizes Gnoc Deng, the Vietnamese cashier, who stares out at them from behind the safety of the counter.}

<CHAR>__{WARREN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{She don't -- you know -- talk.}
<ACTION>__{Amy looks back at Gnoc, snarls, then follows the cashier's gaze to the door. Simon enters. Clutching Henry's cash, he stops dead in his tracks when he sees... Warren and Amy. He steps forward and approaches the beer cooler. Warren and Amy hover around, just out of reach, like a couple of vampires. Dragging a six-pack out of the cooler, Simon crosses to the counter. Warren and Amy hang back, silent and threatening. Gnoc rings up the purchase and glances over at... Amy, staring a hole into the side of Simon's skull. Gnoc hands Simon back his change and he makes for the door, but... Warren shoves himself between it and Simon. Simon freezes. Warren is expressionless. Simon looks back at Amy. She turns away, reaches up under her skirt, jerks down her panties, then leans forward on to the counter. Leering back over her shoulder, she hisses...}
<CHAR>__{AMY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Kiss my ass.}
<ACTION>__{Simon is nonplussed. Gnoc presses a button on the wall that sets... A red light flashing above the stockroom door. Warren grabs Simon by the neck and drags him over to Amy's bare behind. Amy laughs as Simon is forced to his knees and has his face shoved up right into the crack of her ass. But then... Simon throws up all over her. Warren falls back in disgust. Gnoc covers her face with her hands. Amy looks around at herself, realizes, and starts screaming bloody murder. Simon falls back on to the floor, clutching his stomach, as Amy staggers around with her vomit-strewn underwear down around her ankles. Then Gnoc's father, Mr Deng, appears at the stockroom door holding a shovel and ready to fight.}
<CHAR>__{WARREN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(scared)}
<DIAL>__{Oh, shit!}
<ACTION>__{Mr Deng comes running at them and Warren drags Amy from the store. Simon crawls out of the way as the old man throws open the door to the parking lot and screams at the retreating delinquents...}

<DIAL>__{Stay the hell out of my store, you good-for-nothing punks!}

<DIAL>__{Look at this! What's going on here? Simon, get up off the floor! Is this beer paid for?}
<LOC>__{INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Later. Simon splashes water over his face at the kitchen sink, then watches as Henry unpacks one of his suitcases. It is filled with dozens of old, worn notebooks. Henry stacks them on the mantelpiece over the fireplace; the fire is now crackling and bright. Simon steps over and looks at... The name tag on the other suitcase: 'Henry Fool'.}
<CHAR>__{HENRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(off-screen)}
<DIAL>__{Centuries ago it had an 'e' at the end.}
<ACTION>__{Simon looks over and sees... Henry's silhouette against the fire. He steps forward into the light and grabs a beer from the six-pack on the floor. He hands one to Simon. Simon takes it and stares at it a moment before raising his eyes to Henry.}

<DIAL>__{Where do you come from?}
<CHAR>__{HENRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Nowhere in particular.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(stopping)}
<DIAL>__{An honest man is always in trouble, Simon. Remember that.}
<ACTION>__{Simon comes away from the fire, watching him carefully. Henry stands in a dim corner across the room.}
<CHAR>__{SIMON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How do you know my name?}
<ACTION>__{Henry pauses, looks aside, drinks, then grins demoniacally. He steps forward and comes face to face with Simon. He lifts his finger and points to... Simon's name stitched upon the breast of his work shirt. Realizing this, Simon moves off and thinks. Henry throws more wood on the fire, glancing back over his shoulder, laughing mischievously.}
<CHAR>__{SIMON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{I am not retarded.}

<DIAL>__{People. I mean. They think. You know. Because.}
<ACTION>__{He tries to articulate what he thinks he feels but winds up gesticulating curiously with his hands. This finally dissolves into a dumb stare into empty space.}
<CHAR>__{HENRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I see.}
<ACTION>__{Simon looks at him. Henry stands and grabs a notebook from off the mantelpiece. He tears out a few pages and shoves them in his pocket. He hands the now fresh writing tablet to Simon.}

<DIAL>__{Here. Take this. And...}
<ACTION>__{He searches his pockets and finds a pencil.}
<CHAR>__{HENRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{...this. Keep them with you at all times. You ever feel like you got something to say and you can't get it out, stop and write it down. OK?}
<ACTION>__{Simon hesitates, then accepts the gifts. Henry goes for another beer while his new friend studies the dozens of notebooks on the mantelpiece.}

<DIAL>__{What are these?}
<CHAR>__{HENRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(proudly, returning)}

<ACTION>__{Henry drinks and looks down into the raging fire.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(wistfully)}
<DIAL>__{I've been bad. Repeatedly.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(shrugs and steps away)}
<DIAL>__{But why brag? The details of my exploits are only a pretext for a far more expansive consideration of general truths.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(contemplating the notebooks)}
<DIAL>__{What is this? It's a philosophy. A poetics. A politics, if you will. A literature of protest. A novel of ideas. A pornographic magazine of truly comic-book proportions. It is, in the end, whatever the hell I want it to be. And when I'm through with it, it's gunna blow a hole this wide straight through the world's own idea of itself!}
<ACTION>__{He smokes. Simon is impressed. They hear a bottle smash outside in the street and Henry goes to the window. They're throwing bottles at the house.}

<DIAL>__{Come on, let's go break their arms!}
<ACTION>__{Simon jumps up.}

<CHAR>__{SIMON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(pauses)}
<DIAL>__{If I'm quiet.}
<ACTION>__{He is ashamed of himself. Henry sees this and settles down. He considers his new friend with genuine care as he gets himself a new cigarette. He lights up, thinks, then grabs another chair and sits close by Simon. They sit there in silence a while, then...}
<CHAR>__{HENRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Once. I forget where I was. Central America maybe. Somewhere hot. Stupid job. Bad pay. Dangerous location and water so foul the natives wouldn't even piss in it. This crowd of drunken motherfuckers hired by the local drug cartel shows up at my hotel room and threatens to tear me limb from limb. And I say, listen, hombres, OK, you've got me outnumbered four to one and you're gunna kill me here tonight and not a soul in this dimly lit world is ever gunna notice I'm gone. Fine. But one of you... one of you... one of you is gunna have his eye torn out. Period. Silence. I repeat myself. One of you poor, underpaid jerks is gunna have an eye ripped out of its socket. I promise. It's a small thing, perhaps, all things considered. But I will succeed. Because it's the only thing I have left to do in this world. So why don't you just take a good look at one another one last time and think it over for a few minutes more.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(smokes, waits)}
<DIAL>__{They sober up a little, look at their shoes in confusion, then step out into the hall to talk among themselves.}

<CHAR>__{SIMON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Did you take your pills?}
<ACTION>__{Now she says nothing. She smokes and looks away. Simon steps into the bathroom and gets her medication. He runs a glass of water and brings it in to her. She swallows the pills and washes them back with water.}
<CHAR>__{SIMON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You want me to tell her to be quiet?}
<ACTION>__{She looks away, unconcerned and cynical.}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What's the use? She might as well get it while she can. She's not always gunna have the ass she has now, you know. That's just how life is.}
<ACTION>__{She throws the blanket over herself and turns off the light. Simon stands there in the dark.}
<LOC>__{INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Moments later. Simon comes downstairs into the quiet, dark kitchen and sits at the table. He listens to the traffic on the highway and stares off into space. Finally, he takes the notebook Henry gave him from his pocket and places it before him. But then he just gazes off into the dim living-room and scratches his head. Returning his attention to the notebook, he digs down into his pocket and retrieves his short stub of pencil. He opens the notebook and carefully flattens back the cover. Lifting the pencil, he pauses and stares at the blank page. Then, after more intense hesitation, he brings the pencil's dull tip to the very top left edge of the page and begins writing in a slow, laborious hand.}
<LOC>__{INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{The next morning. Henry barges in the kitchen door with two containers of coffee and some jelly donuts. Simon jumps up from where he sits asleep over his notebook at the table.}

<DIAL>__{Good morning, Simon! Glorious day, huh? Here, have a donut. Can you lend me twenty dollars?}
<ACTION>__{Simon rubs the sleep from his eyes, blinks, disoriented and reaches for his wallet.}

<DIAL>__{What's this?}
<ACTION>__{Simon hesitates, shyly.}
<CHAR>__{SIMON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I thought. Um. I was. I wanted to. Maybe.}
<ACTION>__{He gives up, sighs and gazes at the floor. Henry flips through the book, impressed. It is full from cover to cover, every page dense with Simon's cryptic scrawl. Henry frowns, intrigued. Then...}

<DIAL>__{Can I take this?}
<ACTION>__{Simon looks up, terrified. But his friend puts him at ease.}

<LOC>__{EXT. JUNK YARD -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{Later that day. Simon finds a number of volumes of the classics while crushing garbage.}
<LOC>__{EXT. BEHIND WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{That evening. Simon sits with his evening beer and his new collection of soiled classics. He cracks open a volume of Shakespeare and tries to read. It's an obvious struggle. He puts it aside and lifts up Wordsworth, studying its cover and the texture of the pages. A page flutters away and he climbs down to the edge of a greasy puddle to retrieve it. It's now wet and torn, so he flattens it out on the concrete and tries to fit it back into the book. He reads a little, furrowing his brow, then drinks. He bites his lip and tries again. He sits back, exhausted and thinks. He hears a twig snap and looks back over his shoulder to see... Amy throws a bottle at his head. Smash!!!! He falls to the ground, blood streaming down his neck. Warren runs over and grabs him by the shirt, lifting him out of the puddle and smacking him in the head. Amy runs forward and waits with a rolled-up newspaper which she sets aflame with her lighter. Warren punches Simon in the stomach and throws him to the ground, then unzips his fly and pisses on him. Amy watches, giggling excitedly, waving the flaming torch. Simon crawls away and grabs hold of an old section of fence, while Warren zips up and grabs the fire from Amy. Simon pulls himself to his knees, rests his face against the rusted fence and gasps for breath. Warren waves the flaming torch in his face.}

<DIAL>__{One of you. I promise.}
<ACTION>__{Warren watches him blankly, then is burned by the torch which is too hot to handle. He drops it. Amy giggles, then stops, excited, but confused. Simon grips the rusted chainlink so that it cuts into his hands and stares straight at Warren.}

<DIAL>__{You can set me on fire. But one of you is gunna have an eye torn out of your head. I promise.}
<ACTION>__{Warren is transfixed. He shivers and looks at Amy, who steps back, scared, and puts down the gas can. She turns and walks away. Warren looks back at Simon, troubled. He hangs there still, glaring at him. Further away, Warren rejoins Amy and stares at his hands. Amy looks ill.}

She lifts it off the table and reads further, immediately and deeply engrossed. Mr Deng watches as Henry departs with Simon, then comes back into the store and stops, startled, when he sees...
