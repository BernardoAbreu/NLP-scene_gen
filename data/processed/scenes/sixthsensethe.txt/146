<A>__{cole runs hard out of his bedroom and down the hall to the living room. he gets down to the ground and slides under the wooden legged couch. sebastian is already huddled in fear under the couch. cole presses as far back as he can and waits. cole's p.o.v. is of the living room floor. chair legs. coffee table base. rugs... everything is still. cole holds his breath. he waits. beat. nothing happens. he takes his first short breaths and watches the room for any sign of movement.}
