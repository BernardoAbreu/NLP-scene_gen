<L>__{exterior hill above a power plant twilight}
<A>__{tammy sits on a promontory overlooking an omaha public power district station towers, wires, insulators, a loud hum.}
<C>__{tammy }
<D>__{sometimes when i'm sad, i sit and watch the power station.}
<A>__{tammy lifts a pair of binoculars to her eyes, sees the power plant.}

<D>__{they say if you lie between two of the main wires, your body just evaporates. you become a gas. i wonder what that would feel like.}
<A>__{tammy's street evening lisa's car speeds away, growing smaller and smaller. we're back at the break up. close on tammy's face as she stares down the street, unable to move. it starts to rain. tears roll down her cheeks, mixing with the rain. very french, very sad.}

<D>__{i don ' t know what i did to make lisa hate me so much, but somehow she decided to hurt roe. and she knew exactly what to do.}
<A>__{lisa's bedroom day close on paul's face matched in size to tammy's. he is moaning, gasping. from overhead paul is sprawled on lisa's bed, surrounded by stuffed animals. his legs dangle over the edge of the bed, and lisa kneels between them, her head bobbing up and down.}
