<A>__{a big, pink spanish mansion with lots of tile. also last seen outside hollywood liquor on christmas eve, pierce patchett is in the front yard, chipping golf balls over a koi pond. they land in a tight grouping. as he tees up:}
<C>__{bud }
<D>__{you must slay 'em at the country club.}
<A>__{bud's halfway up the walk. patchett sees the cuffs hooked to his belt. patchett is cool as can be.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{are you pierce patchett?}
<C>__{patchett}
<D>__{i am. are you soliciting for police charities? the last time, you people called at my office.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i'm a homicide detective. where were you last night?}
<C>__{patchett}
<D>__{i was here, hosting a party. who was killed and why do you think i can help?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{richard stensland.}
<C>__{patchett}
<D>__{i don't know him. mr...}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{officer white. how about susan lefferts? you know her?}
<C>__{patchett}
<P>__{(sighs, concedes)}
<D>__{you know i do or you wouldn't be here. how did you find me?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{we met outside hollywood liquors on christmas eve. this is where lynn bracken's booze bills go.}
<C>__{patchett}
<D>__{of course...}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{sue lefferts died at the nite owl. i'm investigating.}
<A>__{patchett studies bud a beat, weighing his options. patchett's burly bodyguard starts over from the house.}
<C>__{bodyguard}
<D>__{everything alright, mr. patchett?}
<C>__{patchett}
<P>__{(waves him off)}
<D>__{fine, philip. thank you.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{where's the other guy? buzz.}
<C>__{patchett}
<D>__{he no longer works for me.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{find susan's killer, mr. white. i will give you a handsome reward. whatever you desire .}
<A>__{if only jack had been around to hear that.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{thanks, but no thanks.}
<C>__{patchett}
<D>__{against your code?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i don't have one. lefferts looked beat up christmas eve, but didn't act it. how come?}
<C>__{patchett}
<D>__{do you care about criminal matters peripheral to susan's murder?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{patchett}
<D>__{then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{patchett}
<D>__{then listen closely, because i will only say this once and if it gets repeated, i will deny it. i run call girls. lynn bracken is one of them and so was susan lefferts. i treat my girls very well. i have grown daughters, myself, and i don't like the thought of women being hurt. i sense you share this feeling.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(ignores comment)}
<D>__{why were lefferts' eyes black?}
<C>__{patchett}
<D>__{i think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket. she is was a big doubles fan.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{you wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?}
<C>__{patchett}
<D>__{wait. our deal still holds?}
<A>__{bud nods, his patience running thin.}
<C>__{patchett}
<D>__{i needed a rita hayworth to fill out my little studio.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{what little studio?}
<C>__{patchett}
<D>__{there's gardner, hepburn, grable, turner. lynn bracken is my veronica lake. i use girls who look like movie stars. sometimes i employ a plastic surgeon.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{that's why her mother couldn't i.d. her... jesus fucking christ.}
<C>__{patchett}
<D>__{no, mr. white. pierce morehouse patchett. now, i sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all i will give you. if you persist, i will meet you with my attorney. now, would you like miss bracken's address? i doubt she knows anything, but }
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i got her address.}
<C>__{patchett}
<D>__{of course... this is personal with you, isn't it, mr. white?}
<A>__{bud turns, heads down the walk. patchett hits his golf ball. it lands just past the koi pond, with the rest. ice.}
