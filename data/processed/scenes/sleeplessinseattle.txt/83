<L>__{interior an unfinished dinner on a plate in annie's living room}
<A>__{ night annie is watching "an affair to remember" on television, tears pouring down her face. cary grant is saying: "are you in love with him?" deborah kerr replies: "i'm not now." she's sitting at the dining room table. a dozen pieces of paper litter the table. annie's been unsuccessfully typing a letter on an old underwood typewriter.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{now those were the days when people knew how to be in love.}
<A>__{she takes a blast from the wine glass to her right. becky leans in, refilling the glass. annie begins to type and sob and look at the tv.}
<C>__{becky}
<D>__{you're a basket case.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(as she types)}
<D>__{they knew it. time, distance, nothing could separate them. because they knew. it was right. it was real. it was...}
<C>__{becky}
<D>__{... movie.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that's your problem. you don't want to be in love. you want to be in love in a movie.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{read it to me.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(reading her letter)}
<D>__{"dear sleepless and son..."}
<C>__{becky}
<D>__{it sounds like the name of a mattress store }
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{"i am not the sort of person who listens to call in radio shows" }
<A>__{becky flops on the couch.}
<C>__{becky}
<D>__{and this woman is a writer! that's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i know that. you think i don't know that? "i know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way i can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when i heard the two of you on the radio. on the other hand, maybe i'm just losing my mind."}
<C>__{becky}
<D>__{you are. you're losing your mind. what about walter?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i'm going to marry walter. i just have to get this out of my system.}
<C>__{becky}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i should say something in this about magic.}
<C>__{becky}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i don't know. i mean, what if i never meet him? what if this man is my destiny and i never meet him?}
<C>__{becky}
<D>__{your destiny can be your doom. look at me and rick.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(typing some more)}
<D>__{"i want to meet you..."}
<A>__{cary grant says: "how about the top of the empire state building?"}
<C>__{becky}
<D>__{"on top of the empire state building at sunset on valentine's day."}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{good. perfect. i will be in new york with walter, i can squeeze it in.}
<A>__{she types in becky's idea. then she takes the piece of paper out of the typewriter, smashes it into a ball and tosses it up in the air and into becky's lap.}
<C>__{becky}
<D>__{you want to hear about destiny? if my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, i would never have been on that flight to miami, and met rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant occupied, vacant occupied, vacant occupied" }
<P>__{(she shudders in}
<D>__{ecstasy, then pulls}
<P>__{herself together)}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{you never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.}
<C>__{becky}
<P>__{(nods; after a beat)}
<D>__{he lost all the weight... there.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{that's impossible. a guy can't }
<C>__{becky}
<D>__{can too.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{becky}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{and then you left him? he lost weight there and you left him?}
<C>__{becky}
<D>__{plus he fell in love with a temp.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{listen to this, i love this part }
<A>__{deborah kerr says: "it's now or never." and cary grant says: "we'd be fools to let happiness pass us by." deborah kerr: "winter must be cold for those with no warm memories." becky and annie with tears rolling down their faces.}
<C>__{becky}
<D>__{men never get this movie.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{becky}
<D>__{do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i always wondered about that too.}
<A>__{as becky reaches for a kleenex.}
