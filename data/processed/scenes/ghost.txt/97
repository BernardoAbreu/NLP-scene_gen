<C>__{oda mae}
<P>__{(positively glowing)}
<D>__{i sure do.}
<A>__{sam rushes over to molly. he is not sure what to do. he notices a stack of deposit forms on the counter she is about to pass. he hurries to it and flicks the entire stack, a hundred sheets, flying up into the air. molly, confused, thinks she is responsible and stoops to pick them up. sam, delighted, flicks another stack. oda mae is talking a blue streak when sam returns to her.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<P>__{(continuing)}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hurry up, oda mae.}
<A>__{at that second, oda mae spots a quarter lying on the ground. she stoops down and picks it up.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<P>__{(excitedly)}
<D>__{what a day!}
<A>__{molly sees her, does a double take, and starts to go after her. unfortunately, oda mae steps onto an elevator before molly can catch up. the doors close. molly stops for a moment and then looks back across to the executive area. she sees lionel furgeson and hurries over to him.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{lionel?}
<A>__{he is surprised to see her and grows instantly solicitous.}

<D>__{was her name oda mae brown?}
<C>__{furgeson}
<D>__{no, rita miller. she just closed an account.}
<A>__{molly stares at furgeson. she is not sure what to think.}
<C>__{furgeson}
<P>__{(continuing)}
