<D>__{i decided that the constitution gives me war powers, but no one knows just exactly what those powers are. some say they don't exist. i don't know. i decided i needed them to exist to uphold my oath to protect the constitution, which i decided meant that i could take the rebels' slaves from `em as property confiscated in war. that might recommend to suspicion that i agree with the rebs that their slaves are property in the first place. of course i don't, never have, i'm glad to see any man free, and if calling a man property, or war contraband, does the trick... why i caught at the opportunity. now here's where it gets truly slippery. i use the law allowing for the seizure of property in a war knowing it applies only to the property of governments and citizens of belligerent nations. but the south ain't a nation, that's why i can't negotiate with 'em. so if in fact the negroes are property according to law, have i the right to take the rebels' property from `em, if i insist they're rebels only, and not citizens of a belligerent country? and slipperier still: i maintain it ain't our actual southern states in rebellion, but only the rebels living in those states, the laws of which states remain in force. the laws of which states remain in force. that means, that since it's states' laws that determine whether negroes can be sold as slaves, as property the federal government doesn't have a say in that, least not yet }
<P>__{(a glance at seward, then:)}
<D>__{ then negroes in those states are slaves, hence property, hence my war powers allow me to confiscate `em as such. so i confiscated `em. but if i'm a respecter of states' laws, how then can i legally free `em with my proclamation, as i done, unless i'm cancelling states' laws? i felt the war demanded it; my oath demanded it; i felt right with myself; and i hoped it was legal to do it, i'm hoping still.}
