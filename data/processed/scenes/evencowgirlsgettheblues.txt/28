<L>__{interior julian's bedroom night}
<A>__{sissy enters a bedroom there is a covered birdcage. she sits upon the bed listening for a 'cheep' from the birds. and gradually she reclines. then turning her head to the side against the bedspread:}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{no indian blankets... no indian blankets...}
<A>__{and she blacks out. and the sound drifts away in waves, so there is only the whistle of a distant wind through the mortar of the apartment building... ...until one by one, we see button necks freed. soon sissy can feel it. someone is undressing her. in a voice webby with sleep she lifts her head up, and sees howard and marie.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{where are the others?}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{oh, rupert and carla had a little hassle and went home.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{julian fell asleep on the couch; we covered him up.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{we thought that we should make you comfortable too.}
<A>__{sissy thinks this is nice, but wonders, however, why they are both in their underwear.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{yes, thanks...}
<A>__{between the two of them, they have gotten sissy out of her dress in no time. sissy feels she should apologize for not having on a brassiere. marie slips out of her own brassiere and moves her bare bosom close to sissy's.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{mine are fuller but yours are more perfectly shaped.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{highly debatable. i will wager they're the exact same size.}
<A>__{howard cups his left hand about a marie breast and his right about one of sissy's. he weighs them in his palms, squeezes them the way an honest grocer squeezes excess water from a lettuce, and spreads his fingers to sample their circumference.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{hmm. yours are larger, marie, but miss hankshaw's sissy's are more firm. you'd think they would have started to droop; i mean, from not wearing a bra.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{howard! watch your manners. you've made her blush. here, sissy, let me compare.}
<A>__{marie seizes sissy's free breast, quickly, like a monkey picking a fruit, rolling it about in her hungry little finger, rubbing it against her chin and cheeks... ...and... ...it was like her earlier days as a hitchhiker.... nostalgic..... tropical plums.}
<C>__{sissy}
<P>__{(in ecstasy)}
<D>__{this place is finer than the place i live!}
<A>__{like a disc jockey from paradise, howard flips marie over and plays her b side. every now and then she reaches for sissy to include her, but the laws of physics insist on being obeyed. over and over marie calls sissy's name with half closed eyes. the barths are really going at it, marie yowling like a cat. the poodle in the kitchen begins to growl.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{so this is what it's like... so this is what it's really like.}
