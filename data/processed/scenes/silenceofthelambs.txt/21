<L>__{interior crawford's house study night}
<A>__{crawford, in a cardigan, sits in a wing chair in the book lined study of his suburban home. he turns the pages of clarice's memo as they talk. his tone is sharp.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{i've read your interim memo on lecter. you sure you've left nothing out?}
<L>__{intercutting}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{it's all there, sir, practically verbatim.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{every word, starling? every gesture?}
<C>__{clarice}
<P>__{(a bit heatedly)}
<D>__{right down to the kleenex i used.}
<P>__{(he is silent)}
<D>__{sir, why? is something wrong?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{he mentioned a name, at the very end. "mofet..." any followup on her?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{i spent all evening on the mainframe. lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. no record of anyone named mofet. but "split city" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. i tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.}
<P>__{(glancing at her notes)}
<D>__{it's a mini storage facility outside baltimore, where lecter had his practice.}
<A>__{she pauses, expecting some soft of approval for her cleverness.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{well? why aren't you there right now?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{sir, that's a field job. it's outside the scope of my assignment. and i've got a test tomorrow on }
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{do you recall my instructions to you, starling? what were they?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{to complete and file my report by 0800 wednesday. but sir }
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{then do that, starling. do just exactly that.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{sir, what is it? there's something you're not telling me.}
<C>__{crawford}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{miggs has been murdered.}
<C>__{clarice}
<P>__{(startled, upset)}
<D>__{murdered...? how?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{the orderly heard lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and miggs crying. they found him at bed check. he'd swallowed his own tongue... chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. i told the little prick your conduct was flawless.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{starling...?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{i'm here, sir, i just i don't know how to feel about it.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{you don't have to feel any way about it. lecter did it to amuse himself. why not, what can they do? take away his books for awhile, and no jello...}
<P>__{(a bit softer)}
<D>__{i know it got ugly today. but this is your report, starling take it as far as you can. on your own time, outside of class. now carry on.}
<B>__{angle on clarice}
<A>__{as we hear the loud click of crawford hanging up. she stares at her receiver, stung by his abruptness.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{well god damn it! you old creep. creepo son of a bitch. let miggs squirt you and see how you like it.}
<A>__{she slams her receiver into its cradle.}
<B>__{angle on crawford}
<A>__{as he flips aside her memo, then rises, wearily. he leaves his study, flicking off the lamp, and pads away in his slippers.}
