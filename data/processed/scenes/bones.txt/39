<A>__{but the minute they are in his office, jeremiah's friendly demeanor drops like a mask.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{what the hell do you want?}
<C>__{lupovich}
<D>__{just a visit with my old pal, jay bird.}
<C>__{jeremiah}

<C>__{lupovich}
<D>__{i been watching you. you done good. invested wisely. respectable businessman now. just like you always wanted.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{and you? still a pig. just a much fatter one.}
<C>__{lupovich}
<D>__{no reason to get nasty. yeah, i've stayed in the organization. but then again i never got the percentage you did.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{or you didn't know what to do with it.}
<C>__{lupovich}
<D>__{maybe so. maybe so. but that ain't why i came to see you. you sold the building.}

<D>__{what building?}
<C>__{lupovich}
<D>__{don't shit a shitter. our building. what did you call it? his 'tomb'? we had an agreement. you were supposed to sit on it. not sell it }

<C>__{cla}
<D>__{matter of fact, we did.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{to who?}
<C>__{cla}
<D>__{i only met with the broker. the structure was listed almost worthless and had never even had a bid, i thought you'd be pleased to see it sold to someone who wants to improve the neighborhood. anything wrong?}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{no, of course not. good work. thanks a lot.}
<A>__{she leaves. lupovich is still holding the picture of jeremiah's wife.}
<C>__{jeremiah }
<D>__{you're right. one of my associates sold the building last month.}
<C>__{lupovich}
<D>__{that's a bozo no no. jay bird.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago. they could never connect it to us.}
<C>__{lupovich}
<D>__{you better hope not. cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.}
<A>__{he puts down the photo with a wink.}
<C>__{lupovich }
<D>__{nice rack. how old is }
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{that's it. get out. now!}
<A>__{jeremiah advancing on lupovich, who chuckles and walks out.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{hey, that's...}
<A>__{he's stopped by a kick under the table from patrick.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{that's what?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{that's some terrible shit.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{clean your mouth, or i will. those boys had no business messing down there. go places you're not meant to be that's what you get.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{but that's your old hood, pops.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{yeah, and it took some doing to get out of there. just be glad i did and you can start life from here instead of down there.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{but maybe we're the ones who should be down there. doing something. making it better.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{can't be done. that place already died and gone to hell.}
<A>__{series of angles a montage quick cuts of the moon, the sun, bones neighborhood, patrick and the gang cleaning up the building. and finally, at dusk...}
