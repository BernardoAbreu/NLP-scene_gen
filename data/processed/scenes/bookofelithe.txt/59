<L>__{interior house living room day}
<A>__{it's like something out of the world before. the interior is almost perfectly preserved. chintzy couches. a mahogany table. a tv set in the corner. lace curtains. unreal. eli and solara sit on the couch, feeling self conscious and looking entirely out of place in this cozy environment. george sits across from them on the couch, scowling at them inhospitably. the shotgun resting across his lap. martha emerges from the kitchen, carrying a tray laden with a tea pot and old china cups. cracked and faded, but intact. she places the tray on the coffee table and sits.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i'm afraid we don't have any cake or biscuits for the tea. they ran out some time ago.}
<A>__{she lifts the tea port and pours into the cups. but it's not tea, only water. somewhat murky water. eli and solara stare at the cups, unsure. martha gestures toward them.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{they raise their cups and take a sip. martha watches eagerly. it's clearly a thrill for her to be doing something as civilized and elegant as serving "tea" to guests.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{how do you like it?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's.. uh...}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{it's very good.}
<A>__{martha smiles, delighted. she lifts her own cup to her lips. her hands tremble, the cup rattling against the saucer.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{have you always lived here?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{for almost forty years now. this home is our pride and joy, isn't it, george?}
<A>__{george just grunts. not interested in conversation.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{we refused to leave, even during the troubles. we said, didn't we george, we said if we're going to die anywhere, we're going to die right here, in our own home.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i don't understand how you've survived out here this long.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{well, george is something of a handyman, aren't you, dear? he did a lot of work on the place, making it safe. we may be old, but we're resilient. we've had more than a few who've tried to take this place from us. haven't we, george?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yes. yes we have.}
<A>__{he stands and moves toward the back door. opens it up and beckons eli and solara to come look.}
