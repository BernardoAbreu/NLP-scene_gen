<A>__{as starla runs through here, she looks behind her at the front door to make sure grant isn't following.}
<L>__{interior grant hall night}
<A>__{she runs past a wall of family photos.}
<L>__{interior grant family room night}
<A>__{starla sees the door on the rear of the house, leading to the backyard. she arrives at it, and flings it open grant is there. he lunges onto her. starla screams and drops the cordless phone, just as it starts ringing. grant crawls on top of her body. starla reaches for the ringing phone, but he pins her hands above her head. he looks into her eyes. he's crying. his voice and breath are sick and raspy.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{grant, no!}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{i loved you. i loved }
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{grant, you're sick!}
<A>__{grant is about to cry.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{i wanted you by my side, but you i can't trust you now!}
<A>__{starla's weeping, confused. grant rips his shirt open. starla looks down to see the tubule protruding from the now enormous yellow spore on grant's chest. the tubule feels over starla's blouse, and then slips beneath it. it starts to poke into her skin.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{noooo!}
<A>__{starla grabs the leg of a coffee table beside her. she slams the table into grant's head. this hurts and surprises him sufficiently to let starla get out from under him. starla grabs the cordless phone, which is no longer ringing, and scurries behind the couch. she dials 9 1 1. grant thrusts the couch aside. starla crawls away again, when grant attacks her from behind. he wraps his arm around her neck, pulling her back. he looks down at her with his sick, angry eyes, as his arm now apparently jointless curls around her like a snake. starla gasps for air. her face turns purple. she hears a slamming on the door.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{starla?!! starla, are you in there?!}
<A>__{starla tries to speak but she cannot. suddenly, we hear the front door open.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{starla?!}
<A>__{starla, with barely an ounce of life left in her, sees bill, wally, trevor and margaret burst into the living room. they are surprised, to say the least, to see this diseased humanoid strangling starla from behind.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{fuck!}
<A>__{the cops, freaked out, pull their guns. grant makes a screeching sound at them. they shoot at grant, nicking him. grant jumps away from starla, back into the shadows, screeching in anger and pain. starla falls to the floor. grant slips out the back door and away. the cops stare, gape jawed and frozen with shock; what the hell was that?! starla rubs her neck, coughing. bill pardy runs toward the back door.}
