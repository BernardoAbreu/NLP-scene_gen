<D>__{i don't get why are there so many zombie movies.}

<D>__{it's, like, a metaphor? for crass consumerism or something.}
<A>__{bella glances at her.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{not that you'd know anything about consuming. you didn't buy anything today.}

<D>__{how `bout a ride, girls?}
<A>__{as bella looks across the street, time suddenly slows bella's pov a dive bar, "one eyed pete's" (slow motion) four rough looking guys loiter out front next to their motorcycles. they're in shadow, we can't see their faces. off bella we smash to flashpops: bella surrounded by four guys ("twilight"); edward's volvo skidding to a stop; edward staring them down back on bella, a chill going down her spine, freezing her as she stares at the foursome across the street... then suddenly a pair of lips lean next to her ear }
<C>__{edward }
<D>__{move, bella.}
<A>__{she turns to find edward standing next to her. or so it seems. but he's an illusion; an apparition which becomes clear when jessica steps right into him, dissolving him to nothingness, and time abruptly speeds up again }
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{come on.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i know them... i think...}

<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i want to see something.}
<A>__{much to jessica's frustration, bella begins to cross the street toward the guys, frightened but drawn.}
<D>__{guy #1 alright, we got a taker.}
<A>__{the apparition of edward reappears in her path this time. she stops.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{turn around, bella. this is dangerous.}
<A>__{but when she steps backward, he fades. testing her hallucination, she strides forward again edward's apparition reappears, strides alongside her }
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{stop. now.}
<A>__{she's almost smiling as she reaches the guys, finally able to see them clearly and stops, realizing }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{... you're not them.}
<A>__{and with that.... edward disappears.}
<D>__{guy #1 we'll be whoever you want, honey.}

<C>__{edward }
<D>__{walk away. go.}
<A>__{edward's apparition appears on the other side of the bike. bella looks at him with determination then climbs on to the back of the bike }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i can break promises, too. guy #2}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{... okay.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{bella!}
<A>__{the bike lurches forward, going way too fast. as the wind blasts her hair back, she realizes this might have been a mistake }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{... wait}
<A>__{guy #2 doesn't hear her, guns the engine, going faster bella's pov directly ahead edward stands in road, directly in their path, more present, more clear than ever. the bike's headlight illuminates him, racing toward him }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{stop stop! stop!}
<A>__{the bike abruptly pulls up short.}
<D>__{guy #2 hey, i didn't force nothing on you.}
<A>__{bella scrambles off, stumbling in the process. edward is gone. the four guys then rev their bikes and peel out. bella watches them go as jessica storms up.}

<D>__{what the hell is wrong with you?!}
<C>__{bella}
<P>__{(almost to herself)}
<D>__{i... saw something.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{you. are insane. or suicidal.}
<C>__{bella}
<P>__{(trying to figure it out)}
<D>__{the more dangerous... the more real it was.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{so, what, you're like an adrenaline junky now? go hang gliding or bungie jumping. don't be a complete freak.}
<A>__{an angry jessica charges off. bella watches the motorcycles disappear down the street as }
<C>__{bella }
<D>__{he wasn't real. i knew that. i didn't care. i needed to see him. if danger's what it took, that's what i'd find.}
