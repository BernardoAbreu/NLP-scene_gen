<A>__{a deserted two lane road cuts through the swamp. trees bearded with moss appear as ghostly shapes in the lights of sam's jeep.}
<L>__{interior exterior sam's jeep moving same}
<A>__{san drives a tired face. soft music on the radio. something appears in the road, caught for a moment in the headlights. sam swerves, whirls his head around, sees... a gator sliding of the shoulder and into the murky water. sam lets out some air, relaxing a bit, then catches sight of something else headlights finding reflection in his rearview mirror, coming fast. sam watches as the lights get closer. he looks back to the road an approaching curve... sam is into the curve when the lights catch him. a black range rover moves out to pass, then turns suddenly into sam's lane, cutting him off. it happens quickly. sam swerves to avoid hitting the larger car, but the road affords little margin for error. the jeep slides across a narrow shoulder, then plummets down a steep embankment, crashing through cattails, rolling over to slam back down on its tires in a swampy gulch. sam slumps back from the steering wheel. somewhere over his head he can see headlights shining into the trees. he hears a car door slam, the sounds of someone scrambling down the embankment. sam tries to get out of his seat harness. someone is approaching, splashing through the muck. suddenly a hand reaches through the broken driver's window, helping him.}

<D>__{are you all right?}
<A>__{the hands get him loose. sam stumbles from the car.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yeah, i'm okay.}
<A>__{he looks up to find frankie condo, looming over him.}
<C>__{frankie}
<D>__{that's too bad.}
<A>__{he grabs sam, pulling him out of frame. what we are left with is the sound of fists thudding into flesh then sam, hitting the hood of his jeep, slumping down into the muck. frankie is breathing hard. we hear him slogging back up the embankment. we hear a door slam, the range rover driving away, leaving only darkness, and the eerie sounds of the swamp.}
