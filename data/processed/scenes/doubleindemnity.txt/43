<A>__{d 9 exterior jerry's market day the lasalle stops in front of the market. phyllis steps out and goes into the market, looking around. d 10 shelves in the rear of market neff is moving slowly along the shelves, outwardly calm but with his nerves on edge. from beyond him phyllis approaches. she stops beside him, facing the same way, with a couple of feet separating them.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{hello, walter.}
<C>__{neff}
<P>__{(in a harsh whisper)}
<D>__{come closer.}
<A>__{phyllis moves close to him.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{everything's the matter. keyes is rejecting your claim. he's sitting back with his mouth watering, waiting for you to sue. he wants you to sue. but you're not going to.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{what's he got to stop me?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{he's got the goods. he's figured out how it was worked. he knows it was somebody else on the train. he's dug up a witness he thinks will prove it.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{prove it how? listen, if he rejects that claim, i have to sue.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{yeah? and then you're in court and a lot of other things are going to come up. like, for instance, about you and the first mrs. dietrichson.}
<A>__{phyllis looks at him sharply, sideways.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{what about me and the first mrs. dietrichson?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{the way she died. and about that black hat you were trying on before you needed a black hat.}
<A>__{a customer comes along the aisle toward them. they move apart. the customer passes. phyllis draws close again.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{walter, lola's been telling you some of her cockeyed stories. she's been seeing you.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i've been seeing her, if you want to know. so she won't yell her head off about what she knows.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{yes, she's been putting on an act for you, crying all over your shoulder, that lying little }
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{keep her out of it. all i'm telling you is we're not going to sue.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{because you don't want the money any more, even if you could get it? because she's made you feel like a heel all of sudden.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{it isn't the money any more. it's our necks now. we're pulling out, understand.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{because of what keyes can do? you're not fooling me, walter. it's because of lola. what you did to her father. you can't take it that she might find out some day.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i said, leave her out of it.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{walter, it's me i'm talking about. i don't want to be left out of it.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{stop saying that. it's just that it hasn't worked out the way we wanted. we can't have the money. we can't go through with it, that's all.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{we have gone through with it, walter. the tough part is all behind us. we just have to hold on now and not go soft inside, and stick together, close, the way we started out.}
<A>__{phyllis takes his arm, forgetting where she is. he pulls away.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{watch it, will you. someone's coming.}
<A>__{one of the market help, pushing a small hand truck loaded with packaged goods, comes along the aisle. he stops and begins to restock a shelf very close to neff and phyllis. they go off slowly in opposite directions. camera pans with neff as he walks toward another shelf, one that stands away from the wall. phyllis appears on the opposite side of the shelf and stops, facing toward him. they now continue their low voiced dialogue through the piled up merchandise.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i loved you, walter. and i hated him. but i wasn't going to do anything about it, not until i met you. it was you had the plan. i only wanted him dead.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{yeah, and i was the one that fixed him so he was dead. is that what you're telling me?}
<A>__{phyllis takes off her dark glasses for the first time and looks at him with cold, hard eyes.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{yes. and nobody's pulling out. we went into it together, and we're coming out at the end together. it's straight down the line for both of us, remember.}
<A>__{phyllis puts the glasses on again and goes. over neff's face, as he looks after her, comes the commentary.}
<C>__{neff's voice}
<D>__{yeah. i remembered all right. just as i remembered what you had told me, keyes, about that trolley car ride and how there was no way to get off until the end of the line.}
