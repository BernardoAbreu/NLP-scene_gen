<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{d 22 neff's office (night) the desk lamp is still lighted. outside the windows, the dawn is slowly breaking. neff is still clutching the horn of the dictaphone. there are eight or nine used cylinders on the desk beside him. a widening stain of blood shows on the left shoulder of his gray jacket. he is very weak by now, and his voice holds a note of utter exhaustion.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{it's almost four thirty now, keyes. it's cold. i wonder if she's still lying there alone in that house, or whether they've found her by now. i wonder a lot of things, but they don't matter any more, except i want to ask you to do me a favor. i want you to be the one to tell lola, kind of gently, before it breaks wide open... yes, and i'd like you to look after her and that guy zachetti, so he doesn't get pushed around too much. because...}
<A>__{suddenly he stops his dictation with an instinctive feeling that he is not alone in the room. as he turns in his chair the camera pulls back slowly. the office door is wide open. keyes is standing a few steps inside it. behind him, on the balcony outside, stands the night watchman and the colored janitor, peering curiously into the room over keyes' shoulder. slowly, and without taking his eyes off neff's face, keyes reaches back and pushes the door shut. neff hangs up the dictaphone horn. he looks at keyes with a faint, tired grin and speaks very slowly.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{hello, keyes.}
<A>__{keyes moves towards him a few steps and stands without answering.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{up pretty early, aren't you? i always wondered what time you got down to work.}
<A>__{keyes, staring at him, still does not answer.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{or did your little man pull you out of bed?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{the janitor did. seems you leaked a little blood on the way in here.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{wouldn't be surprised.}
<A>__{neff makes a motion indicating the used cylinders standing on the desk.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i wanted to straighten out that dietrichson story for you.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{so i gather.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{how long have you been standing there?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{long enough.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{kind of a crazy story with a crazy twist to it. one you didn't quite figure out.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{you can't figure them all, walter.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{that's right. you can't, can you? and now i suppose i get the big speech, the one with all the two dollar words in it. let's have it, keyes.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{you're all washed up, walter.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{thanks, keyes. that was short anyway.}
<A>__{they stare at each other for a long moment, then, with intense effort neff gets up on his feet and stands there swaying a little. his face is covered with sweat. his shoulder is bleeding. he is on the verge of collapse.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{walter, i'm going to call a doctor.}
<C>__{neff}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{what for? so they can patch me up? so they can nurse me along till i'm back on my feet? so i can walk under my own power into that gas chamber up in san quentin? is that it, keyes?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{something like that, walter.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{well, i've got a different idea. look here. suppose you went back to bed and didn't find these cylinders till tomorrow morning, when the office opens. from then on you can play it any way you like. would you do that much for me, keyes?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{give me one good reason.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i need four hours to get where i'm going.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{you're not going anywhere, walter.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{you bet i am. i'm going across the border.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{you haven't got a chance.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{good enough to try for.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{you'll never make the border.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{that's what you think. watch me.}
<A>__{neff starts to move towards the door, staggering a little, holding himself upright with great effort.}
<C>__{keyes}
<P>__{(in a voice of stony calm)}
<D>__{you'll never even make the elevator.}
<A>__{neff has reached the door. he twists the knob and drags the door open. he turns in it to look back at keyes' implacable face.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{so long, keyes.}
<A>__{neff goes out, leaving the door wide open. the camera follows his staggering walk along the balcony towards the elevator lobby. the sound of his breathing is so harsh and loud that for a moment it dominates the scene. finally he reaches the swing doors leading into the lobby and starts to push them open. at this moment he collapses. he clutches the edge of the door and as it swings around with him he falls to the floor. he tries to struggle up but cannot rise. in background comes the sound of a telephone being dialed.}
<C>__{keyes' voice}
<D>__{hello... send an ambulance to the pacific building on olive street... yeah... it's a police job.}
<A>__{there is the sound of the phone being replaced in its cradle. then there are footsteps growing louder along the balcony and keyes walks slowly into the shot. he kneels down beside neff.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{how you doing, walter?}
<A>__{neff manages a faint smile.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i'm fine. only somebody moved the elevator a couple of miles away.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{they're on the way.}
<C>__{neff}
<P>__{(slowly and with great difficulty)}
<D>__{you know why you didn't figure this one, keyes? let me tell you. the guy you were looking for was too close. he was right across the desk from you.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{closer than that, walter.}
<A>__{the eyes of the two men meet in a moment of silence.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i love you too.}
<A>__{neff fumbles for the handkerchief in keyes' pocket, pulls it out and clumsily wipes his face with it. the handkerchief drops from his hand. he gets a loose cigarette out of his pocket and puts it between his lips. then with great difficulty he gets out a match, tries to strike it, but is too weak. keyes takes the match out of his hand, strikes it for him and lights his cigarette.}
