<D>__{i'm a human being. sure. once. first time i ever ran away from home, i got as far as atlanta. i met this boy. he'd been with his parents on their way to chicago. they stopped at a gas station. he went to the john. when he came back they'd split. we sorta started looking out for each other. aw, he was sweet. and boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. the chicken hawks were on him all the time. he hated that. sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things. the two of us getting married someday. having kids. stupid stuff.}
