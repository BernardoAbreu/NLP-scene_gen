<L>__{interior sanford tasting room day}
<A>__{miles is at the bar, two glasses in front of him. jack walks in and bellies up next to him.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{baked with a butter lime glaze.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{now we're talking.}
<A>__{chris burroughs, a pourer in a cowboy hat and ponytail, comes over.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{this is the condemned man?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{here he is. jack, chris. chris, jack.}
<A>__{chris and jack shake hands.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how you doing?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{you guys want to start with the vin gris?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sounds good.}
<A>__{two glasses are filled with small amounts of pinot noir vin}
<B>__{gris.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this is rose, right?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{good, yeah, it is a rose. only this one is rather atypically made from 100% pinot noir.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{pinot noir? not again!}
<P>__{(joking, to chris)}
<D>__{you know, not all pinots are noir.}
<A>__{they laugh. miles swirls his glass in tight circles on the bar, then lifts it to smell. jack clumsily imitates miles, perhaps even spilling some wine in the process.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{let me show you.}
<A>__{we see details of what miles now describes.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{first take your glass and examine the wine against the light. you're looking at color and clarity.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what color is it supposed to be?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{depends on the varietal. just get a sense of it. thick? thin? watery? syrupy? inky? amber, whatever...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{huh.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{now tip it. what you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. this is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. now stick your nose in it.}
<A>__{jack waves the glass under his nose as if it were a perfume bottle.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{don't be shy. get your nose in there.}
<A>__{jack now buries his nose in the glass.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what do you smell?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't know. wine? fermented grapes?}
<A>__{miles smells.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{there's not much there yet, but you can still find...}
<P>__{(more sniffs)}
<D>__{...a little citrus... maybe some strawberry... passion fruit... and there's even a hint of like asparagus... or like a nutty edam cheese.}
<A>__{jack smells again and begins to brighten.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{huh. maybe a little strawberry. yeah, strawberry. i'm not so sure about the cheese.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{now set your glass down and get some air into it.}
<A>__{miles expertly swirls the wine. jack follows suit.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{oxygenating it opens it up, unlocks the aroma and the flavors. very important. now we smell again.}
<A>__{they do so. jack smiles.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{that's what you do with every one.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{when do we get to drink it?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{now.}
<A>__{jack gulps his wine down in one shot. miles chews his before swallowing.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how would you rate this one?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.}
<P>__{(to chris)}
<D>__{this is the new one, right, chris?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{released it about two months ago.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{nice job.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{we like it.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to miles)}
<D>__{you know, you could work in a wine store.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{yeah, that would be a good move.}
<A>__{now miles notices something about jack.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{are you chewing gum?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{want some?}
