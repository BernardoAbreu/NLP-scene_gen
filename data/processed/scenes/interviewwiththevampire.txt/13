<A>__{louis, thrashing on the bed in a delirium. lestat places a hand on his forehead and soothes him.}

<D>__{you have to ask me for this. you have to want it, do you hear me?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{give it to me!!!}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{vampires. we thrive on blood.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i want it!}
<A>__{lestat bends close as if to drink louis' blood. louis does not shrink back, but stares into his eyes. lestat draws back, then stands up and goes to the french doors.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{tomorrow night. you must prove yourself. i will give you the choice i never had.}
<A>__{he looks outside.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{the sun's coming up. watch it carefully. if you come with me tomorrow, you'll never see it again.}
<A>__{he leaves. louis sits dazed, staring at the empty french window. the sun rises with unnatural beauty, over the swamplands and the plantation, filling the room, striking water pitcher, glass, mirror, and the picture of his dead wife.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{my last sunrise. that morning i was not yet a vampire, and i saw my last sunrise. i remember it completely, yet i don't remember any sunrise before it. i watched the whole magnificence of the dawn for the last time, as if it were the first. and the i said goodbye to sunlight and went out to become what i became.}
