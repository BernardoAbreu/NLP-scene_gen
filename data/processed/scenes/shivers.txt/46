<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{elevator doors slide open and kurt steps out, pushing his cart. he walks down the hallway looking for betts's apartment. after he has passed a few doors he approaches one which is slightly ajar. as kurt approaches, the door opens wider to reveal the old woman from the laundry room. she is no longer wearing her dumpy laundry clothes, however, but is dressed in a translucent nightgown and wears a grotesque amount of make up. she is careful to keep half her face hidden behind the door. kurt notices her but chooses to ignore her. he is just approaching her when she calls to him.}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{i'm hungry!}
<A>__{kurt keeps on moving. he is now just passing her door. the old woman edges out from behind the door a bit more.}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{i'm hungry!}
<A>__{kurt can't resist turning to look at her, although he keeps moving. when he looks her in the eye, she eases out slightly from behind the door to reveal that half her face has been horribly burned by the laundry room parasite, the eye melted shut, the nostril drooping. kurt is so stunned that he slows. the old woman speaks softly.}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{hungry for love. hungry for love.}
<A>__{she suddenly reaches out and grabs kurt by his tux with both hands and, with tremendous energy, jerks him back into her apartment and slams the door closed with a vicious kick. kurt's cart remains out in the hallway, the food steaming.}
