<A>__{lionel lumbers out of the closet, a pillow stuffed into his jacket to create a monstrous hunchback. his acting, performed just for his children, is quite magical.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{"be not afeard; the isle is full of noises, sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not. sometimes a thousand twanging instruments will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices, that, if then i had waked after long sleep, will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming, the clouds methought would open, and show riches ready to drop upon me; that, when i waked, i cried to dream again."}
<A>__{the lads are enthralled. the door bell rings. lionel is not expecting anyone.}
