<A>__{marshall cautiously enters the room. ready for action. the room is empty, but it's been trashed by the firefight. the sound of voices... coming from the duke game which still plays. marshall hustles over to one of the secure phones. it's dead. he tries the regular phone. dead. hangs it up in disgust.}

<D>__{goddamnit.}
<A>__{he steps on some glass. it's a broken frame holding a photograph of alice and rose. he picks up the photo and lays it on a table. he thinks for a beat... glances around the room, searching... then he crosses to the closet, opens it and begins rifling through his wardrobe.}
