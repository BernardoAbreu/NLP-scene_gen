<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{momma can have a piece.}

<D>__{did what?}
<A>__{missus walters immediately gets it. she bursts out laughing so hard she has to lower herself to the floor.}
<C>__{missus walters}
<D>__{well, hilly, that's what you get, i guess. and you didn't just eat one. you ate two slices!}
<A>__{hilly starts to hyperventilate as everything sinks in. as minny leaves, hilly runs to the sink and throws up.}
