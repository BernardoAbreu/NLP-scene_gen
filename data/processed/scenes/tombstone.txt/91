<L>__{ext cowboy camp night}
<A>__{ringo crouches by the fire with the other cowboys, his face a deeply shadowed mask. 2 iron springs survivors stand before him:}
<D>__{1st cowboy we hit him half a dozen times but he just kept comin', walked right up to curly bill with that 10 gauge and blew him up!}
<C>__{ringo}
<D>__{curly bill? he killed curly bill?}
<A>__{ringo starts making strange little inarticulate sounds, inhaling and exhaling like an animal, eyes swimming in panic....}
<D>__{2nd cowboy he didn't just kill him, he burned him down! blew him in half! i mean all the way in half, like a melon! then he turned around with that big colt and killed johnny barnes, shot up a couple more 'fore we got out of there. but it was his face, you should've seen his face.}
<C>__{ringo}
<D>__{he's just a man. 1st cowboy you didn't see his face}
<A>__{ringo looks up at them, suddenly dead calm, his face a blank.}
<C>__{ringo}
<D>__{you see my face, don't you?}
<A>__{out of nowhere, ringo draws and fires 2 shots so quickly they sound like one. the 2 survivors drop with bullets through their brains. the others jump, transfixed by the insane brutality of what he's just done. ringo draws himself up, in full possession of the situation, the new leader, fearsome, matchless:}
<C>__{ringo}
<D>__{everybody get this through their heads. wyatt earp dies. i'm running the show now and i'm telling you, earp dies. his men too. they all die. understand? we're gonna kill 'em. for what they did to curly bill we're gonna ride 'em into the ground and slaughter 'em like rabbits. 'cause this is my time, children. this is where i get woolly.}
