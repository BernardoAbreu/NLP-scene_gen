<A>__{bullets rip through the cooler. junior squeals. more shots. casings hit the ground. smoke rises. bozo leans in.}
<C>__{bozo}
<D>__{i think we got }
<A>__{rah! a tiny white arm fires out from the cooler grabbing bozo's leg. bozo yelps. moving quick, tuffy grabs the judge from bartender and shoves the barrel into a hole. blam! guts splatter. bozo falls back unscathed. he catches his breath and looks to tuffy. she is born again, seething.}
<C>__{tuffy}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<A>__{she hands the shotgun back to bartender.}
<C>__{trampy}
<D>__{jesus, it took all that? all those bullets? how can we possibly fight off the others?}
<C>__{heroine}
<D>__{aim for their orifices. eyes, ears and mouth. from what i've seen, it's their only weakness.}
<C>__{roadie}
<P>__{(looking at the corpse)}
<D>__{looks like they're soft on the inside like any other animal. trick is to get in there and do the damage.}
<C>__{belle}
<D>__{maybe we don't have to fight them.}
<C>__{bozo}
<D>__{right, let's just call 'em names.}
<A>__{coach steps forward, poised to make the sale.}
<C>__{coach}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, if i may have your attention.}
<A>__{the bar skeptically eyes the large, sweaty greek man.}
<C>__{coach}
<D>__{we have to think outside the box here. we don't need to fight them, we need to scare them. scare them right back. this is a species stand off. we just need to show them we're not vulnerable. that we're formidable.}
<C>__{adulterer}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{coach}
<D>__{i need a stick.}
<A>__{bartender opens the cooler's lid and carefully pulls out junior beast with salad tongs. it falls to the floor with a splat. coach grabs a splintered broomstick.}

<C>__{heroine}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{coach shoves junior's mangled body through to the outside.}
<C>__{coach}
<D>__{showing superiority. the scent of their dead may drive them away.}
<A>__{the whole bar moves to the side wall to see how the beast family will react. they look through small holes, barely able to see anything.}
<C>__{beer guy}
<D>__{i don't see them.}
<C>__{coach}
<D>__{come on. come onnnnnn.}
<C>__{belle}
<D>__{is there a call, or something?}
<C>__{bozo}
<D>__{see that you monkey fucks! that's what you get when you mess with us! woman or man, i don't give a fuck! shit don't make me gay because you'll be sucking my dick!}
