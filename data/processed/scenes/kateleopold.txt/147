<A>__{a flash of light illuminates the forest at the albany estate. a beat. kate races from the forest onto a massive lawn, stumbling in mud as she hurries to the mansion's entrance.}
<L>__{interior ballroom night}
<A>__{huge double doors open to reveal an ornate ballroom. the creme de la creme have gathered and dance. kate overwhelmed, rushes down an elaborate staircase. half way down she looses a shoe. she hesitates briefly then continues to the dance floor. in the center of the floor, leopold, looking very distinguished and attractive, dances with a flirtatious young woman. try as she might, leopold keeps her at a distance.}

<A>__{the music changes: a lively charleston. leopold heaves a sigh of relief and makes his way through the crowd, up the staircase. the dancers become an intricate maze, a dead end at every turn as kate searches each male face. in the foreground, leopold is stopped by a woman midway up the stairs. as they chat, leopold reaches down and picks up the muddy slipper, offering it to her. she turns in a huff, flouncing down the stairs. simultaneously, in the background, kate desperately looks for leopold. leopold studies the slipper as he makes his way up the stairs. he slows down, hesitates and stops. very slowly he turns around. he becomes very still. tears well up in his eyes. the ballroom clock strikes midnight. kate climbs an opposite staircase to get a better view then stops. in her heart she knows. slowly she turns. leopold stands quietly at the bottom of the stairs, gazing up at her. he extends his arm, showing her the ring. he offers her his hand. the crowd, the room, the world around them, disappear. their eyes lock. as she descends the staircase, the years melt away. kate's short hair grows long, cascading around her shoulders. the fine lines around leopold's face are gone. they see themselves through each other's eyes, at the moment of youth, when they fell in love. leopold bends down, places the slipper on kate's foot. he rises, looks down at his hands and then up at kate. his hands are caked with mud. she smiles helplessly. not caring, he wraps his arms tightly around her. music begins to play, a slow waltz. he nods to her. she takes a deep breath. her head bobs in rhythm. she begins to count silently. leopold smiles, counting along.}

<D>__{i've never seen her before.}
<A>__{kate and leopold dance past. they are older. as they gaze into each other's eyes, they twirl. the look of youth returns. at the center of the floor they stop dancing. they kiss. the rest of the world dances around them. over this background... the scrapbook pictures bleed onto}

<A>__{the old formal wedding photo becomes a photograph of kate and leopold the perfect bride and groom, both discreetly point to their rings. kate stands with leopold as he establishes a scholarship for studies in physics. the old photograph of leopold and albert einstein changes to include kate, waving and smiling broadly for the camera. the professional photograph becomes a double portrait. it shows the two in their 70's, sitting regally in matching chairs. they hold hands and smile serenely. staring directly into the camera, they show off their rings. slowly the scrapbook closes... kate and leopold dance, the music swells as they become lost in the crowd. the clock chimes. slowly we...}
