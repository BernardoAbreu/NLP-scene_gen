<L>__{interior screening room, cinecitta night}
<A>__{a screen, the leader of a film reel, numbers counting down, the synch pop on 3, and claudia appears on the screen, looking extraordinary from the hair and makeup test. people start to comment, all enthusiastically. guido gets a cigarette off pierpaolo and lights up.}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(to lilli)}
<D>__{great work, lilli... wonderful costume...}
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{...and the hair, makeup, fantastic.}
<A>__{guido watches, sitting alone, he turns around as he sees someone come in the door, but it's gianluca, not luisa.}
<C>__{benito}
<D>__{she has a beautiful profile.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{two great profiles.}
<C>__{fausto}
<D>__{she's a goddess.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{and the back isn't too bad.}
<C>__{fausto}
<D>__{she came directly from venus. beautiful.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{fantastic. guido? really nice. who's next?}
<C>__{benito}
<D>__{actresses.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{okay. let's see the actresses.}
<A>__{the reel finishes. the lights come up, to excited chatter, he looks at lilli a row or two behind him, she shrugs sympathetically. the room goes dark, the next reel begins. guido turns back to look at the screen. during the reel, dante is very decisive... shouts out, as the women appear. they come on, one after the other, say their names. guido gives them things to do. pick up the phone and argue with your lover. no, make him laugh. make him want you. walk towards the camera as if you were frightened. as if you were angry. on eleanora very angry on the phone:}
<C>__{benito}
<D>__{if we like her, we have to call her agent right away. everybody wants her right now.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{well they can keep her.}
<C>__{benito}
<D>__{she's a very funny actress.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{she's peculiar. you don't like her guido?}
<A>__{next actress: ilaria. someone comes in the door. guido turns and sees it's luisa, sitting next to lilli. she's come. he turns back to the screen. another actress appears. it's donatella. very nervous. she says her name. guido instructs her. she tries the phone, the walks. she's not a natural. luisa finds the gentle humor in this situation. she looks at guido. a little smile. he feels it like sunshine. he turns back to the screen.}
<C>__{dante }
<D>__{she's nice.}
<C>__{fausto}
<D>__{she's very natural.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{even better. she's a bit nervous here. what do you say, guido? donatella's nice?}
<A>__{another girl: alessia. very striking. keeps looking out past the camera, getting sotto voce instructions from guido. her hair is in a chignon. she begins her improv, but guido interrupts her, suddenly appears in front of the camera. approaches her, and undoes the chignon, freeing her hair. she's beautiful and innocent. guido says something to her, a whisper. but what he says and how he says it, the smile it provokes, goes like a dagger to luisa.}
<C>__{dante }
<D>__{who's this? i thought we were looking for a blonde.}
<C>__{fausto}
<D>__{she's too tall.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{very tall.}
<C>__{benito}
<D>__{she's very beautiful.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{it's not the pointerior guido wants the blonde.}
<C>__{fausto}
<D>__{she's not bad, but }
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{shh.}
<C>__{fausto}
<D>__{she's beautiful.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{she's too beautiful. for my tastes.}
<A>__{as the reel finishes... and the lights come up.}
<C>__{dante }
<D>__{i don't know what guido thinks. i think we are happy with donatella. donatella's better, isn't she?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(delighted, jumps up)}
<D>__{great. anyway, fantastic day, but we have to go home. we have a very, very busy day tomorrow. thank you very much everybody. thank you. okay, well done.}
<A>__{the screening room empties, a lot of mutual congratulations on good work, especially to lilli, and a hug or a handshake from almost everybody for luisa. lilli kisses her, leaves. just the two of them now, husband and wife, several rows apart in the empty screening room.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{it meant so much to us all. that you came.}
<C>__{guido }
<P>__{(nothing from luisa)}
