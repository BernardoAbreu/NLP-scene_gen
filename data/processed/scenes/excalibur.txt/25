<L>__{interior passageway, tintagel castle night}
<A>__{uther strides to igrayne's bedchamber, his warrior knights following. he is dirty and his iron dress is blood spattered.}
<C>__{uther}
<P>__{(bellowing)}
<D>__{three horses died under me, so hard did i spur them here. is it born? is it alive?}
<L>__{interior igrayne's bedchamber, tintagel castle night}
<A>__{at his approach and entrance the ladies shrink back, and morgana edges closer to her mother, and seats herself on the bed beside her. ingrain holds her newborn baby in her arms, the blood of birth still wet upon it.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{out!}
<A>__{the ladies slip past him to the door, and he goes up to igrayne.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{what is it, lady?}
<A>__{terrified of him, igrayne faces him the best she can.}
<C>__{igrayne}
<D>__{a boy, sir. rest yourself.}
<A>__{uther waves away her words but does sit down on the bed, exhausted. he notices morgana, who stares at him.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{send the girl away.}
<C>__{igrayne}
<D>__{she is just a child }
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{out!}
<A>__{igrayne draws the child to her and kisses her cheek.}
<C>__{igrayne}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{go now. come back later.}
<A>__{the child leaves silently, hatred in her eyes.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{she watches me with her father's eyes.}
<A>__{he grasps the newborn baby with his iron hand, and pulls it to himself. he looks upon it with wonder, with a gentleness that is unexpected.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{igrayne, is he mine, or }
<A>__{he can't bring himself to say his name. she hesitates on the edge of tears, worried for the infant lying in its iron cradle.}
<C>__{igrayne}
<D>__{the night he died, a man loved me with great fierceness. he looked like my husband, spoke like, smelled like, felt like my own husband. but it was not he, for he was already dead. it wasn't his spirit, for this child, who was conceived that night, is flesh and blood. i know nothing more.}
<A>__{uther draws a dagger. he lifts it.}
<C>__{igrayne}
<D>__{no }
<A>__{but he uses it before igrayne can move. he severs the leather thongs that bind the iron breastplate to his chest. he casts it to the floor. his chest is smooth and milk white in striking contrast to his creased, weathered face. and beaming, he holds the baby to it.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{through him, i will learn to love them, for i am tired of battle. i will stay by his side and}
<P>__{(looking shyly at igrayne)}
<D>__{his mother's...}
<A>__{igrayne's hatred for the man is at the very edge of becoming love. the baby starts to cry.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{here. it's hungry.}
<A>__{and his free hand opens her shift, and he holds a swollen breast in his gloved hand, squeezing gently. milk bubbles from it and he thrusts the baby's mouth onto it. igrayne weeps and uther watches proudly as the baby suckles. merlin advances from the window, his cape the same iridescent green black as the feathers of the crows that were perched by the window.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{merlin! out of the sick sleep at last.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{doing what i did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. it takes it's toll. it took nine moons to get back my strength.}
<A>__{uther avoids looking at him.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{now you must pay me.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{i?}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{the child is mine, uther. i have come for him.}
<A>__{uther is shaken to his roots. igrayne watches, trying to understand.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{the oath. you didn't say }
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{you didn't ask!}
<C>__{igrayne}
<D>__{uther, is it true? don't let him take the child.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{i swore an oath, igrayne. i made a pact with merlin.}
<A>__{igrayne suddenly understands. she glares at uther.}
<C>__{igrayne}
<D>__{it was you? you came to me that night. you are the father.}
<A>__{uther is caught, and turns to merlin who is harsh and unswaying.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{it's not for you, uther, hearth and home, wife and child.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{to kill and be king, is that all?}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{maybe not even that, uther. i thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. but it'll take another, a greater king...}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{you strike me with words as hard as steel.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{they are not weapons, my friend, but truths. you betrayed the duke, stole his wife and took his castle, now no one trusts you. lot, uryens, your allies will turn against you. give me the child, uther, i will protect him. go back to your war tent.}
<A>__{uther wrenches the baby from it's mother's breast and hands him to merlin.}
<C>__{uther}
<P>__{(in torment)}
<D>__{by the oath, take the devil child. take him!}
<A>__{with the bawling baby under his cape, merlin exits. igrayne pulls herself out of the bed, weak, her legs giving under her. she starts after merlin.}
<C>__{igrayne}
<D>__{why?... why must he have the baby?}
<A>__{uther stops her with his bulk and she claws savagely at his chest to get past him. he weeps as he folds his arms around her.}
