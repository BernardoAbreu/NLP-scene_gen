<A>__{he throws the rosary at hellboy. instinctively, hellboy catches it. it smokes in his hand. he tosses it away. it lands next to the explosive belts. hellboy opens his palm, seeing the smoking, charred imprint of the cross and beads. he looks over at grigory. with a blood curdling scream, hellboy grabs his horns with both hands, brutally snaps them off. energy spews from the stumps. he stabs grigory with one of them. grigory drops to his knees, holding his stomach. hellboy drops the blood stained horn. the final lock disappears into the stone. the light flickers and the connection with the moon is broken. ilsa, licking her bloody lips, looks up. the sky is silent. the thunderclouds are parting. the eclipse has ended. grigory crumples in agony. the burning glyphs in hellboy's stone hand dim down, his features and body resume their usual shape. all is quiet.}
