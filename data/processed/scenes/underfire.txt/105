<L>__{interior rafael's tent}
<A>__{the tent is filled with sandinista officers and soldiers standing and sitting around. rafael's body lies on a table the shirtless upper torso propped slightly upright, still wearing glasses, the figure of rafael is distinctly non heroic. he is slightly overweight, slightly balding, but as he lies there surrounded by his men, the the glow of lanterns, he looks almost alive. price and claire look at each other.}

<D>__{why is he laughing?}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{you're crazy.}
<A>__{cinco steps forward his presence commands attention. his delivery is forceful but not emotional. as he begins to speak, price stops laughing.}
<C>__{cinco}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{we have momentum, but many more lives will be lost. even washington is starting to admit that the butcher somoza is not loved by his people. they have detained twenty five million dollars in new arms shipments for somoza at an airfield in florida until they find out if rafael is alive or dead. we know about these things.}
<A>__{he pauses briefly.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{if washington thinks rafael is dead, they will ship the arms to somoza. do you understand.}

<D>__{this has nothing to do with journalism there is more to the world than journalism. we are going to end this war with you or without you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{people don't really believe in rafael they believe in the idea of rafael, no? because for now the idea of rafael is enough for the people of nicaragua. when the war is over none of this matters.}
<A>__{price hesitates, his manner devoid of its usual cockiness.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{i don't do things... like this.}
<C>__{cinco}
<D>__{enough lives have been lost already.}
<P>__{(beat of empathy)}
<D>__{it's difficult, i know but you must do it.}
<A>__{commandante cinco places an arm on price's shoulder and speaks in broken english.}
<C>__{cinco}
