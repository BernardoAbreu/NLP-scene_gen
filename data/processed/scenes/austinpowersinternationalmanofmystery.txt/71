<A>__{austin and vanessa enter past two british military policeman. there is a communications center, a makeshift armory, bunks, etc. we see basil, dressed as the vegas era elvis.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{hello, exposition.}
<C>__{basil exposition}
<D>__{austin, vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. dr. evil has high jacked a nuclear warhead from kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one hundred billion dollars. if the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{thank you, exposition. only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.}
<C>__{basil exposition}
<D>__{what's the other?}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{basil exposition}
<D>__{what's the other thing you're scared of?}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{carnies.}
<C>__{basil exposition}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{circus folk.}
<P>__{(shudders)}
<D>__{nomads, you know. they smell like cabbage.}
<C>__{basil exposition}
<P>__{(suffering him)}
<D>__{indeed... if we could get back to the business at hand. it's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.}
<P>__{(hands him the photos)}
<D>__{i've uncovered the details on project vulcan. it's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.}
<C>__{basil exposition}
<D>__{good god, and underground missile. we've long feared such a development.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{when did you find that out, austin?}
<C>__{basil exposition}
<D>__{austin did some reconnaissance work at alotta fagina's penthouse last night.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{basil expositon}
<D>__{our next move is to infiltrate virtucon. any ideas?}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{yes, virtucon runs a tour of their facilities every hour. i suggest we pose as tourists and do site level reconnaissance.}
<C>__{basil exposition}
<D>__{top drawer, kensington. oh, austin, i want you to meet somebody.}
<A>__{basil waves to an extremely frail elderly british lady.}
<C>__{basil exposition}
<D>__{austin, this is my mother, mrs. exposition. she's in from tunbridge wells in kent. can you believe, she's ninety two years old?}
<A>__{austin hauls off and punches the lady in the face.}
<C>__{basil exposition}
<D>__{my god, austin, what have you done?}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{that's not your mother, that's a man!}
<A>__{austin begins tugging on her hair.}
<C>__{mrs. exposition}
<D>__{owww...my hair!}
<C>__{basil exposition}
<D>__{get away from my mother!}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{austin, have you gone mad?}
<A>__{the two guards come over and help mrs. exposition to a cot.}
<C>__{mrs. exposition}
<P>__{(through pain)}
<D>__{who is that man? why did he hit me?}
<C>__{basil exposiion}
<D>__{don't worry, mother. lie down. austin, you have a lot of explaining to do.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{i'm sorry, basil, i thought she was a man.}
<C>__{basil exposition}
<D>__{damn it, man! you're talking about my mother!}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{you must admit, she is rather mannish. no offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{really, austin!}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{look at her hands, baby! those are carpenter's hands.}
<C>__{basil exposition}
<D>__{all right, austin, i think you should go.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{i think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.}
<C>__{basil exposition}
<D>__{i'm leaving!}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{oh, and austin?}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{yes, basil?}
<C>__{basil exposition}
<D>__{be careful.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{basil escorts his mother out.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{austin, may i have a word with you?}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{of course, luv.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{listen, i know i'm just being neurotic, but i can't shake this suspicious feeling about that italian secretary, ms. fagina. i mean, i don't want to sound paranoid, but i've had some bad relationships in the past, and i have some jealousy issues. you went to her penthouse. it makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but i can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{don't be sorry. you're right to be suspicious. i shagged her. i shagged her rotten.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{i can't believe you made love to her just like that. did you use protection?}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{of course, i had my nine millimeter automatic.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{no, did you use a condom?}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{only sailors use condoms, man.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{not in the nineties.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port. alotta meant nothing to me.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{well, it means something to me. if you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one woman man.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{it was just a shag, vanessa. you're everything to me.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{you just don't get it, do you, austin? good night. welcome to the nineties, you're going to be very lonely.}
