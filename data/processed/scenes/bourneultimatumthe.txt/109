<L>__{exterior day. sewell and marbury madrid}
<A>__{bourne arrives, begins to recon the area. he goes to the front door finds "sewell and marbury" and rings the bell. no answer. two cops come around a corner. bourne sees them, notes the side of the building and leaves.}
<L>__{interior day. cri hub new york city}
<D>__{tech#1 sir, we just hacked ross's email account at the guardian and found a round trip ticket to turin, yesterday. 0800 arrival, 12:05 departure.}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{i think we can be pretty certain that bourne's not your source then?}
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{ross's call to his editor, where he said he just met the source on blackbriar, took place just after his flight landed. his met his source in turin.}
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{so, what, bourne met ross for breakfast and then, at noon the same day bourne calls ross to demand a meet at waterloo?}
<C>__{cronin}
<P>__{(needling wills)}
<D>__{maybe they were even on the same flight?}
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{cross check the secure cell phone usage of everyone with blackbriar sci clearance against all calls in and out of turin during the morning ross was there}
<A>__{technicians start pounding keyboards.}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{the guy you're after is a cia operative with clearance above top secret. he was committing treason by talking to ross. do you really think, while doing that, he used a cell phone he knows we can track?}
<C>__{tech 3 }
<D>__{zero results on the cross check.}
<A>__{vosen stares daggers at her.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{do you have a better idea?}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{yeah, i'd look at all the people whose cell phones were switched off the entire period ross was in turin.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{do it jimmy.}
<A>__{technicians start tapping.}
<C>__{landy}
<P>__{(looks at cronin)}
<D>__{i mean if your people use their cell phones as much as mine do, the list should be pretty small}
<C>__{technician 3 jimmy}
<D>__{three names: tom brewster, jack boulin, neal daniels.}
<A>__{the names display on the screen: tom brewster, jack boulin neal daniels. the hub employees can't help but be impressed by landy. wills and vosen notice their response.}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{now check everything in ross's apartment against those names. look for common patterns, look for }
<C>__{cronin}
<D>__{initials .....bring that up on main.}
<A>__{landy turns. cronin is leaning down in front of a computer screen. point to something for the tech who puts it on the big screen, blown up. in a set of handwritten notes by ross it says "per n.d."next to several scrawls.}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{neal daniels. he's station chief in madrid now, isn't he?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{jesus christ.}
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{call the rso at the embassy and have them take daniels into custody if he's there. if he's not, get a grab team to the calle norte safe house. send them in heavy and tell them we'll assist with entry.}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{"heavy?" daniels isn't }
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{i'm worried about bourne. if he's not ross's source, then he must be after ross's source just like us.}
<A>__{off landy...}
