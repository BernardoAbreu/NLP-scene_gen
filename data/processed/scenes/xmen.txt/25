<L>__{interior cavernous room night}
<T>__{close up on:}
<A>__{the periodic table of elements. a chart made up of blocks depicting the elements and their chemical symbols. among the standards like gold (au) and iron (i) and oxygen (o2) is a new square on simple red construction paper tacked to the top. it contains simply a large letter ia.i}
<T>__{tracking shot through:}
<A>__{we are in a laboratory of sorts, quite different from any we have ever seen and so are its occupants. mortimer toynbee, a dim, loyal thug whose agile leaping ability and superhuman strength have earned him the name}
<B>__{toad.}
<A>__{across the room, john allerdyce, a wiry redhead whose ability to control fire with his fingers has earned him the name pyro. in the corner we see blob, no explanation needed, devouring a bucket of cereal, preariously balanced on his huge belly. they are a bestial and sinister bunch. toad and pyro are working on:}
<B>__{a machine}
<A>__{a fantastic device which occupies a hallowed space in this lab. it is meticulously designed, and with its intricate circuitry, wires, and power boards, it resembles most closely (and only resembles, because truly itis like nothing weive ever seen before) a combination of an upright torpedo and a fantastic light source only far more dark and foreboding. pyro holds a stick of solder in one hand. he lights a lighter with the other, then drops it. strange thing the flame remains hovering about his finger. quickly the flame intensifies and turns blue, melting the solder over a small circuit board. then, the flame is gone. he sticks out his hand like a surgeon.}
<C>__{pyro}
<D>__{hand me the dykes.}
<A>__{toad, both hands occupied, flicks his long tongue and grabs a pair of pliers which he rests in pyrois hand, leaving them slicked with slime. the flame in his finger goes out. the slimy coat over the pliers quickly hardens, freezing their action.}
<C>__{pyro }
<D>__{i asked you not to do that.}
<A>__{blob laughs. toad shrugs. in the background, almost ignored by them, something is on the television. the news.}
<C>__{newscaster }
<D>__{preparations are nearly completed for the upcoming anniversary gala celebrating the formation of the united nations. with nearly every invitation confirmed, the occasion promises to be the largest single gathering of world leaders in history.}
<A>__{the image in the screen is a helicopter shot of ellis island, with liberty island and the famous statue in the background.}
<C>__{newscaster }
<D>__{ellis island, once an arrival point for thousands of immigrants crossing the atlantic with the hopes of a better life, will open its doors again. only this time it will be to leaders and their families from over 200 nations.}
<A>__{blob belches his skepticism deafeningly. track further through the lair and out the door as the newscast drones on.}
