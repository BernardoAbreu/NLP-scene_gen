<L>__{interior cafeteria lunch line later}
<A>__{anything sexually suggestive you can do with school cafeteria food, olive does as she makes her way through the lunch line, as guys ogle her. marianne, also present in the line, watches her in repugnance.}
<L>__{interior gymnasium day}
<A>__{olive emerges from the girls' locker room, dressed for gym class. a terrified fat kid named evan nervously approaches her.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{hey olive.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{hi evan.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{can i talk to you for a second?}
<A>__{he gestures for her to follow him underneath the bleachers. she reluctantly does so.}
<C>__{evan }
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{don't get mad, but brandon told me what you did for him.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{well, rest assured, it was equally as thrilling for me.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{no, he told me the truth.}
<A>__{she's pissed. she silently seethes.}
<C>__{evan }
<D>__{and i was just hoping that maybe you could do the same for me?}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(through clenched teeth)}
<D>__{walk away, evan.}
<A>__{evan starts to talk, but she raises her hand to silence him.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{run away, evan.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i can pay you, too.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i'm about six seconds away from slapping you so hard that your unborn grandchildren will feel it.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(excited at the prospect)}
<D>__{can you do it in front of everyone?}
<A>__{olive turns and starts to leave. evan summons up his courage and meekly states to her back.}
<C>__{evan }
<D>__{i don't need your permission, you know.}
<A>__{she turns around and gives him a look of death. he can't look at her.}
<C>__{evan }
<D>__{i mean, at the rate you're going, i'm just saying i don't think anyone would not believe it.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{are you threatening me?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i will give you $500.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{you're repugnant.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(indicating his body)}
<D>__{that's the problem.}
<A>__{and once again olive feels too sorry for him to say no.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i want five hundred dollars in gift certificate form deposited in my locker before noon tomorrow. preferably `the gap,' but i will also take amazon.com. we did not have sex. i was piss ass drunk and i let you fondle my chest and it was a glorious moment for you, unmatched by anything you've heretofore experienced, including cake. got it?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{five hundred bucks for just feeling you up? doesn't that seem a little steep to you? can you throw in}
<C>__{some}
<P>__{(mispronouncing it; as if it rhymed with `cottage')}
<D>__{frottage?}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(correcting him)}
<D>__{it's fraw tahzh, dumbass.}
<P>__{(buckling)}
<D>__{fine. but it was so good, you lasted only twelve seconds and i better not find out that little pecker of yours ever came out of your pants. take it or leave it.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{little pecker? nuh uh. for five hundred dollars, it was ungodly huge. you even commented on the unusual girth for a guy my age.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i was too drunk to remember.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{three minutes.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{two.}
<A>__{he extends his hand.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{deal.}
<A>__{she, repulsed by it, shakes his hand. evan's ecstatic.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{the sad thing is, evan, if you had been a gentleman and asked me out on a date, i probably would have said yes.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{really? do you want to go on a date?}
<A>__{with zero vitriol }
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{not now, i don't.}
<A>__{sad for him, she walks away.}
