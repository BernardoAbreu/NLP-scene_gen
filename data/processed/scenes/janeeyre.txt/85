<L>__{interior night. thornfield the drawing room hall}
<A>__{jane is delivering adele into the centre of the company.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{may i present miss adele varens?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{bon jour, mesdames, monsieurs.}
<A>__{jane finds it hard to get a proper impression of the guests, as she cannot raise her eyes to look at them. adele makes a dainty curtsey pink frock, hair in ringlets, little lace gloves. in the midst of the crowd is blanche.}
<C>__{blanche}
<D>__{why, what a little puppet.}
<C>__{lady ingram}
<P>__{(mutton dressed as lamb)}
<D>__{is this your ward, mr rochester?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{louisa eshton}
<P>__{(english rose; nineteen)}
<D>__{what a love of a child.}
<A>__{adele blissfully disappears into a moving sea of dresses. only one guest is still looking in jane's direction; blanche. her lip curls in distaste. jane backs into a nearby window seat; always her place of refuge. she closes her eyes. a great atlantic wave hits the sash window behind her, drenching it with foam and brine. when she opens her eyes, rochester is in her line of vision, standing out in a crowd of unmanly men. he senses her gaze; glances at her. jane looks down, pulling her work on to her lap; a beaded purse. she does not lift her eyes from the beads, fully feeling the humiliation of her class and of her love. blanche sidles up to rochester.}
<C>__{blanche}
<D>__{i thought you weren't fond of children?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{you're right; i'm not.}
<C>__{blanche}
<D>__{then what induced you to take charge of that little doll?}
<A>__{rochester turns away from jane.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{she was left on my hands.}
<C>__{blanche}
<D>__{why don't you send her to school?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{she has a governess.}
<A>__{jane glances up; sees rochester's back to her, throws her eyes down, once more.}
<C>__{blanche}
<D>__{you should hear mamma on the chapter of governesses. i had half a dozen in my day all detestable, ridiculous incubi were they not, mamma?}
<C>__{lady ingram}
<D>__{did you speak, my lily flower?}
<C>__{blanche}
<D>__{i said governesses.}
<A>__{the reaction is instant.}
<C>__{lady ingram}
<D>__{oh, don't mention them; the very word makes me nervous! i've suffered a martyrdom from their incompetence and caprice. i thank heaven we're now done with them.}
<C>__{blanche}
<D>__{i have just one word to say of the whole tribe; nuisance.}
<A>__{jane's fingers sew. only the briefest flash of her eyes towards the company shows her mortification. blanche has started playing a brilliant prelude on the piano.}
<C>__{blanche }
<D>__{we shall have music and new subject, if you please. signor eduardo, what shall it be?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{donna bianca, i give you beauty.}
<C>__{blanche}
<D>__{beauty? why there's nothing new to be said. i give you back male beauty. mamma, what's your idea of male beauty?}
<C>__{lady ingram}
<D>__{my son, of course.}
<C>__{lord ingram}
<D>__{hear hear.}
<C>__{blanche}
<D>__{oh, tedo's quite typical of the young men of today. they're so absorbed in the pursuit of fashion that they've forgotten how to be men at all.}
<C>__{lord ingram}
<D>__{i say }
<C>__{blanche}
<D>__{a woman who neglects herself is a blot on humanity. but a man should pay no heed to his looks.}
<P>__{(glancing at rochester)}
<D>__{a man should possess only strength and valour. he could be a gentleman or a highwayman. his beauty lies in his power.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{so a levantine pirate would do for you?}
<C>__{blanche}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{as long as he resembled you.}
<A>__{rochester laughs loudly. jane is heading for the door.}
<C>__{blanche }
<D>__{i am serious. to my mind, a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him.}
<A>__{jane closes the door on blanche. she breathes in fresh air, nauseous. blanche's splendid prelude drifts out. rochester comes into the hall from the other door. jane instantly bends down and pretends to be tying her shoe.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{why did you leave the room?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i am tired, sir.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{why didn't you come and speak to me? i haven't seen you for weeks. it would have been normal and polite to wish me good evening.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you seemed engaged, sir.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{what have you been doing while i've been gone?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{teaching adele.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{you look pale.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i am well.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{you're depressed; your eyes are shining with tears. what's the meaning of this?}
<A>__{jane catches sight of mrs fairfax, who is watching them with an expression of unease. rochester glares at her.}
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<D>__{a gentleman has arrived to see you, sir.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<D>__{he says he's travelled a long way, from spanish town, jamaica }
<A>__{rochester seems winded.}
<C>__{mrs fairfax }
<D>__{and indeed i think he must have come from some hot country because he won't take off his coat.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{spanish town...}
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<D>__{mr richard mason. he says you're old friends. i've put him in the morning room.}
<A>__{rochester cannot speak.}
<C>__{mrs fairfax }
<D>__{have i done wrong?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{not at all. please tell him i will see him directly.}
<A>__{mrs fairfax goes.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{oh jane jane. this is a blow.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{can i help you sir?}
<A>__{in the drawing room, blanche's prelude finishes to enthusiastic applause. rochester has jane's hand.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{jane, if all those people came and spat at me, what would you do?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{turn them out of the room sir, if i could.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{and if they cast you out for adhering to me?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i should care nothing about it.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{you'd dare censure for my sake?}
<A>__{jane is frightened of his passion.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{for the sake of any friend who deserved it.}
<A>__{rochester lets her hand go. he steps back. he goes to the morning room. jane peers through the door, worrying how her last words have given offence. she sees a man rising to meet rochester; handsome but gaunt and painfully thin. his smile doesn't reach his eyes as if his soul is not quite his own.}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{fairfax...}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{richard. how the devil are you?}
<A>__{they embrace, rochester doing a fine impression of delight.}
