<L>__{interior vaughan's dining room night}
<A>__{vaughan, albert the "friend," linda, frank, karl, and melinda, the dollar store girl, are seated at the table. karl and frank are going at the delicacies while melinda shyly picks at hers and the others are engaged in idle chit chat. this goes on for a few moments, then albert's attention turns to karl.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{so karl, do you intend to stay in the lawnmower business for a while or do you have other plans?}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{i reckon.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{i think karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. you should see all the books he has. he must read constantly.}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{i ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. i can't understand a lot of what i try to read. my mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when i try to read.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{i'm the same way. of course, in my line of work, i stay too busy to read. but at least i have job security. people may stop doing a lot of things, but one thing is for sure, they won't stop dying.}
<C>__{linda}
<P>__{(looks at frank)}
<D>__{why don't we talk about something a little more festive.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{does everyone like the food?}
<A>__{nods and yeses.}
<C>__{vaughan }
<D>__{good. i haven't decided yet if i'm a good cook.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{hey karl, you know what? melinda was voted employee of the month at the dollar store last february. isn't that somethin'?}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{yes ma'am, i reckon.}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{well, when you like pricing items as much as i do, i guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{karl, maybe you and melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. it's a nice night.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{vaughan, don't get pushy.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{i like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{i stay on my feet all the time at work. i just can't find shoes that's comfortable.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{hospital shoes might be the answer. nurses' shoes.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{or the kind old ladies who work in the school cafeteria wear.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{same difference.}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{i get real mean when my feet hurt. it's the only time i don't like checkin' out the customers, when my feet hurt.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{frank, you and karl aren't talkin' much, you boys must really like that food.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i just don't have anything to say about shoes.}
<A>__{silence for a moment.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{listen everybody, i know this may sound corny, i've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but i'm going to say it anyway. it just came over me in a rush. i want you all to know that i care about each and every one of you at this table.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{that's very sweet of you vaughan. we care about you, too. don't we y'all?}
<A>__{nods, grunts, "sure do's."}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{also, melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that albert was here tonight, okay.}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. unfortunately, i have to keep certain parts of my life private.}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{you mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{i think everybody at the store knows that already. they always talk about it. maureen ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the first baptist church no more.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{karl, why don't you and melinda go take a walk. it's nice out.}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{all right then.}
<A>__{he gets up and walks toward the front door. melinda gets up and tries to catch up.}
