<L>__{interior hotel corridor night}
<A>__{a little drunk and happy, roy and myra come down the corridor together, then make it obvious they're going into separate rooms, across the corridor from one another.}
<C>__{myra}
<P>__{(coy, sexy)}
<D>__{see you later.}
<A>__{roy complains, but half heartedly, half humorously; this argument has already taken place.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. you expect your father to come through?}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{separate bathrooms, darling. i will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(nevertheless grumpy)}
<D>__{things a man isn't supposed to know.}
<C>__{myra}
<P>__{(soothing)}
<D>__{you don't mind, really, do you, roy? it's been such a wonderful evening, i guess i just wore myself out.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{sure. i'm pretty tired myself.}
<A>__{they unlock the opposing doors, look back at one another. myra's smile and good night wave are consciously cute. roy's response is a little forced. they go into their rooms.}
