<D>__{who you trying to protect, mutherfucker? i'm telling you this s.o.b. could be one of them.}
<A>__{garry breaks it up, pulling them apart. macready enters from the outside. a bundle is tucked under his arm.}
<C>__{garry}
<D>__{hold on, damn it. we're getting nowhere... if this bit of blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{and if it got to clark... clark could have gotten to anybody.}
<A>__{macready moves over to the table.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{theoretically any of us could be whatever the hell this thing is.}
<A>__{norris shakes his head, rubbing his chest in slight discomfort.}

<C>__{macready}
<D>__{well, you can believe it now.}
<A>__{he drops the bundle he had been holding on the table between the men. it is the shredded pair of long johns.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{nauls found this yesterday. it's ripped just like the clothing on the norwegian we brought back. the same thing was happening to bennings' clothes when it got to him. seems these things don't imitate clothes. just flesh and bone.}
<A>__{the men look from one another. silence. macready picks it up and examines the label.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{size large.}
<P>__{(grins)}

<D>__{doubt if it got to more than one or two of us. but it got to someone.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{somebody in this room ain't what he appears to be.}
<A>__{a pause as all eyes travel from man to man.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<P>__{(scared)}
<D>__{well, what we going to do?}
<A>__{norris turns to dr. copper and fuchs.}
<C>__{norris}
<D>__{can there be... some kind of test? to find out who's what?}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{a serum test possibly.}
<C>__{fuchs}
<D>__{right. why not?}
<C>__{garry}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{it's a simple blood typing test. this thing's blood chemistry is different than ours. basically we mix someone's blood with uncontaminated human blood. if we don't get the proper serum reaction then that person isn't human.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{whose uncontaminated blood we going to use?}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{we've got blood plasma in storage.}
<C>__{garry}
<D>__{how long will it take you to prepare this?}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{a couple of hours.}
<C>__{garry}
<D>__{well, get to it.}
<A>__{garry unhinges a key from his belt and hands it to dr. copper. dr. copper and fuchs head for the infirmary.}
<C>__{palmer}
<D>__{how's that thing get to the dogs? i though we stopped it in time.}
