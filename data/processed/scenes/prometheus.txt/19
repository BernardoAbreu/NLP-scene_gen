<L>__{exterior weyland's wheel}
<A>__{the elevator descends along the spoke to the rim.}
<L>__{interior weyland's wheel rim foyer}
<A>__{a luxurious lobby. tasteful lighting. eames era furniture in wood and chrome: the past's vision of the future. at the rim, the wheel's rotation supplies gravity. an elevator door opens. watts and holloway step out holloway with a sleek metal folio slung over his shoulder. the floor is the outer surface of the wheel: in both directions it curves upward out of sight. the walls are all windows: on one side, earth rotates lazily. on the other, a wheeling field of stars. david, an android, stands waiting for them. he's cunningly built, but no one would mistake him for a real human being.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{professor holloway. dr. watts. my name is david.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{hello, david.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{mr. weyland's eager to meet you.}
<A>__{he strides off across the foyer. watts and holloway exchange a wondering glance and follow.}
<C>__{exhibit hall}
<A>__{david leads past models of planets, moons and asteroids. holographic labels and data swirl around them.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{these are all the planetary bodies on which weyland industries has mining claims.}
<A>__{the end of the hall is dominated by a huge globe of mars. markings indicate widespread surface activity.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{and mars. weyland's crown jewel.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{how is that going? the terraforming.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{they say you're getting diminishing returns. it's not working.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's the greatest engineering project ever attempted. challenges are inevitable. mr. weyland's a determined man.}
<C>__{weyland's office}
<A>__{peter weyland sits behind a mahogany desk. he's a warren buffet type: a country sage, horse sense and hard knocks. he might be seventy years old, or a hundred and seventy. behind him stands director lydia vickers, a slim woman of 45 in a costly business suit. shrewd and watchful. once a great beauty, she now trades in ruthlessness. david stands against the wall. watts and holloway settle into chairs in front of weyland holloway holding the metal folio.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{professor holloway. ms. watts.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{doctor watts.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{forgive me. peter weyland.}
<A>__{he notices watts looking curiously at david. he smiles.}
<C>__{weyland }
<D>__{ah. david here's a prototype. our 80 series. one of a kind for now, but if he performs, he will be legion.}
<P>__{(his smile fades)}
<D>__{what do you want here?}
<A>__{holloway looks at him, startled.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{we sent you a prospectus that...}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{assume i know nothing.}
<A>__{holloway swallows. lays the metal folio on weyland's desk.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{i'm an archaeologist.}
<A>__{he touches a tiny remote. holographs appear in the air over weyland's desk: the folio is a three dimensional imager. pictures of a younger holloway in the field: excavating ruins in egypt, china, peru, greece.}
<C>__{holloway }
<D>__{in my studies i discovered a pattern i couldn't explain. every eleven hundred years, sudden advances in agriculture, tool use, technology. inventions. something caused a great leap forward. every eleven centuries. the pattern holds as far back as our data goes.}
<C>__{holloway }
<D>__{tens of thousands of years. i had to understand this. it became the focus of my work.}
<A>__{weyland nods. holloway glances at watts and forges on.}
<C>__{holloway }
<D>__{dr. watts was a student of mine.}
<A>__{watts touches her own remote. the holographic display turns to scientific diagrams. images of a very young and beautiful watts in the laboratory.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{i was analyzing historical changes in human dna. i found the same pattern. every eleven centuries, a pulse of new information in the genome of the human race. all over the world. evolution can't do that. something was changing us. changing the dna of our species.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{humanity's been visited. visited by...beings from somewhere else.}
<A>__{behind weyland, vickers can't suppress a scowl of disdain.}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{you mean aliens.}
<A>__{a beat. the others had forgotten vickers was there.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{lydia vickers, director of operations. practically my right hand.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{they guided us to civilization. lifted us up, again and again. i call them the engineers.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{once you know what you're looking for, it's amazing how the evidence falls into place.}
<A>__{photographs flicker through the display: holloway and watts in the field, excavating new sites. intimately close. their finds: columns of writing on stone tablets in egypt, china, cambodia, peru. patterns of lines, curves, and dots.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{this is the writing of the engineers. we've found it on every continent. and last year, we found our rosetta stone.}
<A>__{the display shows the engineer obelisk under the sea.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{the writing is a formula giving the location of a single star in our sky.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{which star?}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{we're keeping that confidential for now. but that's where we want to go.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{you want me to pay for an interstellar research expedition!}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{it's a chance to be part of a revolution in scientific...}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{don't sell me, professor. you've been turned down by every university and government agency under the sun. nobody's going to gamble that kind of money on your hunch.}
<A>__{holloway deflates. watts winces. this is a bloodbath.}
<C>__{weyland }
<D>__{nobody but me.}
<P>__{(he grins)}
<D>__{i've read your research.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{that's impossible. our research is }
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{quantum encoded on secure servers, yeah. we have an a.i. division, you should know. doing impressive things.}
<P>__{(he leans across the desk)}
<D>__{i know which star you're wishing on.}
<A>__{the scientists stare at weyland.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{you're bluffing.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{zeta two reticuli.}
<A>__{he regards their shocked faces with satisfaction.}
<C>__{weyland }
<D>__{you know how i got this rich? i ask myself: what does god spend his time doing? and i go and do that.}
<A>__{watts laughs incredulously. stifles it. weyland's not joking.}
<C>__{weyland }
<D>__{biotechnology was good to me. fusion power. lately doing well with gravity systems.}
<A>__{he swivels his chair toward the window. earth shines outside.}
<C>__{weyland }
<D>__{but what's the first thing god did?}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{he made the heaven and the earth.}
<A>__{weyland jabs a finger at her like she's won a carnival prize.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{that's what i'm talking about. you left out my favorite part. the piece about earth. david.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{for eons, earth's climate swung from hothouse to ice age. explosions of life, then mass extinctions. but twelve thousand years ago the swings stopped. the holocene epoch began a period of anomalous tranquility. the rise of civilization began only then.}
<A>__{holloway and watts stare at david with new appreciation.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{and that change coincides with a visit by the engineers. they didn't just change us. they changed our world.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{that's the piece i mean. engineering earth. god stuff.}
<A>__{he swivels back to his desk. rummages in a drawer.}
<C>__{weyland }
<D>__{my people checked your science. they say it's solid.}
<A>__{he pulls a thick contract out. drops it in front of holloway.}
<C>__{weyland }
<D>__{i will give you your expedition. ship and crew, supplies, support. one condition.}
<A>__{holloway picks up the contract with the cautious joy of a man double checking a lottery ticket. his voice is husky:}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{you get the discovery. control of the site. but any technology you find? anything at all. that's mine.}
<A>__{holloway reaches out slowly and picks up the contract. riffles the pages of small print legalese.}
<C>__{weyland }
<D>__{you take david with you. my eyes and ears. and vickers...you're going too.}
<A>__{vickers stares at weyland in shock.}
<C>__{white landscape}
<A>__{a glittering formation of white crystals. diamond on diamond. the structures grow more complex as the view widens. leaves and branches of crystal. a shimmering field of white jewels. a landscape of white crystals, smooth as snow.}
