<L>__{exterior beach early day}
<A>__{eric nears the line of buckets and cuts inland towards the mine. carter has nearly caught up. the buckets grind and crash as they move along the cable. eric scrambles up the narrow valley down which the coal slag travels. he is panting horribly. carter is close on his heels. near the top, where the buckets are practically at ground level, eric stumbles and falls. he is too exhausted to get up. carter stands over him.}
<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(panting slightly)}
<D>__{stand up, eric. stand up.}
<A>__{eric just manages it. carter pulls the bottle of scotch out of his pocket.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{i bet you could use a drink, could you, eric?}
<A>__{he throws the bottle to eric.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{eh? have a drink.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{still got your sense of humour.}
<A>__{eric takes the cap off and looks at carter. he's in a terrible state.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{drink up, eric. drink up. i want you to drink all of that. do you understand? drink up. just like it was with my brother, frank. go on, son. drink up.}
<A>__{eric pours the whisky into his month. it spills over and runs down his face.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{drink up, eric.}
<A>__{eric begins to stagger about.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{it was you who poured it down him. eh, eric?}
<A>__{eric takes a breather and looks pathetically at carter. no mercy there.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{did you all have a good laugh, eh? did you have a good laugh when he was spewing it up? the whisky is pouring all over eric's face and suit.}
<A>__{it's disgusting to watch. suddenly, he retches, but nothing comes up.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{drink it! drink it! did you all pass the bottle round after the car went over the top?}
<A>__{eric is choking.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{don't stop, eric.}
<A>__{carter leans forward and with his free hand lifts the bottle up to eric's mouth again. in the other, he holds the shotgun. eric chokes and retches. carter has seen enough.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{goodbye, eric.}
<A>__{carter raises the butt of the gun and brings it down on eric's head.}
