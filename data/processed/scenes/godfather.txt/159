<L>__{ext day: sicily road}
<A>__{the three move through a flock of wind blown sheep, and make their way to a dusty rural road. we hear a rinky horn sound, as a pre war italian automobile makes its way to them. an old man peeks from the window, waving to michael. the car pulls in front of them and stops. michael nods respectfully.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{don tommassino.}
<C>__{don tommassino}
<D>__{michael, why must you do this. we have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret. it is from love for your father that i've asked you never to more than an hour from the villa.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{calo and fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.}
<C>__{don tommassino}
<D>__{you must understand that your father's enemies have friends in palermo.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{don tommassino}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{corleone.}
<C>__{don tommassino}
<D>__{there is nothing there. not anymore.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i was told that my grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.}
<C>__{don tommassino}
<D>__{long ago. now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to america.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{don tommassino...i should see this place.}
<A>__{don tommassino thinks a moment, then concedes.}
<C>__{don tommassino}
<D>__{that is your birthright...but michael, use this car.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no...i would like to walk to corleone.}
<A>__{the old man sighs, and then returns to his car.}
<C>__{don tommassino}
<D>__{be careful michael, don't let them know your name.}
<A>__{the old car sputters off; michael watches, and then continues on his journey.}
