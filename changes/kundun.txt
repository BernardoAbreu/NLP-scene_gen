A yellow palanquin is carried by four large monks, wearing maroon robes. The caravan reaches the top of the mountain pass and turns - a sudden shift in direction - a switchback.  The travelers head downhill.}

<ACTION>__{Now, we see the mens's destination.  A lake.  An incredibly blue, circular lake, sunk between snow-dusted mountains.  It is LHAMO I' LATSO - "the Oracle Lake" - and it shimmers in the sunlight. As the lake comes into view, a young man pushes back the curtain of the yellow palanquin and peers down at it. The man is dressed in royal robes.  He is young, twenty four years old.  His name is RETING RINPOCHE.  He is the Regent of Tibet. The color of the lake changes - from brilliant turquoise, to a deep, murky, unfathomable darkness.}

<CHAR>__{WOMAN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(VO)}
<DIAL>__{Go to sleep, Lhamo.}
<ACTION>__{Reting stares at the lake. The water turns a light grey, and an image appears - obscure at first, then becoming more solid.  A vision. He sees a house - a small, stone, one-story, u-shaped house. The house has a flat, tile roof and an unusual, wooden rain gutter, with windows outlined in black and a prayer flag in the courtyard.  A spotted dog is in front of the house, barking, though we cannot hear him.  The vision becomes completely clear, for an instant - clear enough to see the face of a young boy at the window. CLOSE on Reting Rinpoche.  Looking.  Searching. Cut to:  a portrait of a mountain:  Kyeri - a majestic, glacier mountain - the "house mountain" of the village of Takster, Amdo Province, North Eastern Tibet. Sound returns as the wind whistles around this jagged, mountain peak and then the view moves down, below the tree line, and into the rhododendron forest and the farmlands, until it comes to rest on a small, stone, u-shaped house.  A house caught in the dawn's mist. CLOSE on the face of a sleeping child:  a boy, LHAMO DHONDRUP, age two and one-half years.  He is dreaming.  He is about to wake up. Today, his life will change. We stay on the boy's face until, slowly, his eyes open - beautiful, dark, eyes.}

<ACTION>__{The MOTHER walks past the boy, her woolen skirt swaying in the rosy light.  A seven year-old brother - LOBSANG SAMTEN - and a teenage sister - TSERING DOLMA - share Lhamo's kitchen mattress.  Lhamo looks at them, and then he turns to see the heavy felt boots of his FATHER, as the man walks through the room and out the door.  Lhamo finds the kind face of his MOTHER.  She is looking at him.}
<LOC>__{EXT.  COURTYARD  DAWN}
<ACTION>__{The boy walks across the stone courtyard as we hear the sounds of this country morning:  the snorting of horses, clucking of hens, a command from the Father as the man feeds the animals. The boy scratches, he pees.  He sees his Mother on the roof. She is a silhouette against the dawn, as she feeds cedar and yak chips into the incense burner - sending white, curly smoke up, to circle the prayer flag and its clusters of printed mantras. We pull back as the spotted dog begins to bark. Lhamo's house is the house in the vision.}
<LOC>__{INT.  KITCHEN  MORNING}
<ACTION>__{It is a good day.  There is cheese for breakfast. Lhamo's Father sits on a cushion at the head of a low table. Fresh bread appears, yogurt, roasted barley (tsampa). Lhamo pushes at his Father.}

<ACTION>__{The Father is leaving the yard with a short string of horses when there is a sudden commotion. The CHINESE GOVERNOR is passing through this little village. He is a ferocious looking man, dressed in ornate brocade, his horse eguipped with tack that looks like armor.  He is surrounded by a dozen Chinese soldiers, all on huge horses, ruling the road, kicking up mud. Lhamo's Father stops.  He holds still.  He looks to the house. The Mother is holding the children against her in the doorway.  Quiet.  Watching. The Governor and his entourage move on.  When they are out of sight, Lhamo's Father makes his departure.}

He is one of the monks we saw at the Oracle lake, the one with the mesmerizing eyes.  Keustang Rinpoche is the Lama of Sera Monastery.
