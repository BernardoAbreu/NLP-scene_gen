<B>__{the screen}
<A>__{stygean darkness. wet clicking sounds. a beam of purplish ultra violet light reveals a mosaic of moving forms... cockroaches. they skitter restlessly under the beam's intensity. series of shots the uv beam passing over various parts of the space. pipe webs, walls, girders all covered with the insects. thousands of them.}
<B>__{pull back to reveal}
<L>__{interior sewer system}
<A>__{innards of steel. a vast maze of tunnels. a group of figures advances through the tunnels with handheld uv lamps. the figures are dressed in gray air tight neoprene suits, their faces hidden by skin tight masks and bug like night vision goggles. in the dense silence, respirator valves hiss click at the corner of their lips in mechanical rhythm. the scene has a dream like, choreographed quality. night vision pov eerie, aquatic green. the horde of insects appear to be some kind of sea life, crawling over the floor of a dead ocean.}
<B>__{the team of figures}
<A>__{from their midst appears another figure, its neoprene suit a flat white. female, clearly the team leader. she carries a stainless steel container filled with twenty small compartments, each bearing a large, heavy shelled roach with a different barcode on their back.}

<A>__{tchk!! a dozen of the judas roaches are released. they slide through into the area.}
<B>__{the nearby roaches}
<A>__{react instantaneously. in a rustle of tiny legs, they begin to stream toward the judases. jostle and fight each other for position to mate with them. they even crawl over the team leader in an effort to reach the judases. the team leader makes no effort to brush them off. patient, almost godlike, she watches the mating.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{a manhole has been opened above. chains are dropped down and attached by a team member to a 100 gallon disposal drum. reveal the floor of the tunnel, carpeted with the still forms of the roaches, now all dead. the team members quietly shovel the tiny corpses into other disposal drums. at their feet skitter the only survivors of the massacre: the bar coded judas roaches. in a crunch of machinery, the first disposal drum is lifted by the chains through the manhole to}
<L>__{exterior a city street day}
<A>__{midtown manhattan. a cacophony of sound and light. dirty snow drifts over bryant park. emergency lights blink everywhere. a wall of cars sits on sixth avenue, stopped dead. exhaust fumes hang in the air. jaded traffic cops send the cars on crosstown detours. mounted policemen patrol a line of yellow sawhorses near dozens of department of public health vehicles, angle parked in a military phalanx. a monumental ribcage like scaffolding has been erected in the middle of the street, "sealing" the area with amber plastic. inside, uniformed workers take the disposal drum of roaches and toss it into one of a number of huge dumpsters. the team leader watches from nearby, exhauster. her mask is off. we see her face: enthomologist susan wyeth, 28. an arm gently drapes over her shoulder.}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{how we doing?}
<A>__{she looks over at dr. peter tyler, 34, bespectacled. a headset around his neck, a coat emblazoned with the department of health logo. he has the look of a man who's just fought a long battle and come out victorious.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{we'll see...}
<A>__{he offers her a bite of a pay day candybar. susan smiles, shakes her head. she wearily leans against him. peter looks out as the dumpster filled with roaches is raised by mechanical arms into the waiting maw of the dump truck.}

<B>__{image resolves to a video on a screen.}

<D>__{with the aid of genetic labs throughout the country, we recombined cockroach dna with genetic information from termites and mantids. we were able to create a biological counter agent. a new ally, if you will...}

<B>__{alphabet city streets}
<A>__{empty warehouses. closed businesses. traffic lights blinking on empty streets. everything seems doomed under the heavy layer of rain. superimpose: two years later a dilapidated building before us. a blazing neon cross made of the words 'jesus saves' hangs askew from its facade. crane to see the rooftop. wham! the door to the interior stairs flies open and a tall, thin chinese preacher in his sixties lurches out, eyes wild with terror. he looks back down the steps. something's climbing up fast, casting ominous, complex shadows on the wall. too many footsteps for it to be just one person. the man hurriedly shuts the door and slides a bolt home. trembling, he backs away as a booming thud makes the door shudder. raw, frenzied pounding and scratching follows... something inhuman, determined to break through. the metal surface suddenly buckles and bulges. on the man's white undershirt, a blotch of blood starts to grow. needles of rain stab his flesh. he searches wildly for a possible escape. he reaches the edge of the roof: it's five floors down to the sidewalk. two of the hinges on the door come loose, pulverizing the surrounding concrete. wham! the door to the stairs bulges outward as something smashes against it again and again. frenzied scratching. the man sprints to the other end of the roof. there, on the adjoining building... the chinese preacher's pov just one floor below on the building across the alley is a suspended painters' platform, crowded with paint cans under a tarp. a two story old eyewear advertisement from the 40's is being painted over.}
<B>__{the chinese preacher}
<A>__{looks back to the door. bam! a tremendous shattering sound. light spills from inside. two bolts fly in the air, a hinge gives. he cries out in terror. the man gauges the distance between buildings; can he make it? he takes a few steps back, a few more... panting hard, he closes his eyes, his chest soaked in blood and rain.}
<B>__{the door explodes outward and skids across the slippery roof.}
<A>__{light from inside projects the shadow of wild, busy things onto the curtain of rain. weeping with fear, the man desperately tries to hurl himself to the catwalk. it's too far. he falls...crash! he hits the platform, knocking boards loose and sending paint cans onto their sides, rolling. he bounces, slides off the edge, barely able to grab onto a loose board to save himself from falling. the rain blasts down. the scaffold creaks. he hits the edge, upsetting the cans of paint there. he holds onto the planks with all his might, trying to push with his feet, but they slide on the wet wall.}

<B>__{across the rooftop}

<B>__{chuy}
<A>__{watches, still clicking with his spoons. the chinese preacher's body is stuck. one of his legs is through the hole up to the thigh, but the other is folded up unnaturally and pressing against the wall next to the vent. impossible. there is a silent beat, and then a series of incredibly violent tugs, bam! bam! bam! shaking the paint soaked body like a rag doll.}

<A>__{peter finally slows down. he checks his pulse and stops at a water fountain. as he drinks, he sees a derelict drawing a figure on the sidewalk. the derelict spots peter. he picks up his chalk, drifts off. intrigued, peter goes closer to the drawing. an arrow points to a manhole cover set among the bushes. peter circles around, trying to make sense out of the lines. then the painted motif finally reveals itself.}

<A>__{we rush toward his horrified face.}
<B>__{the albino}
<A>__{directly ahead. the train, still flying, plows into it... ...flattening, grinding, pulverizing... ...until the windshield of the subway car is covered in white blood. the motoran leans on the brake, his eyes screwed shut in primal horror. the train squeals to a stop...}

<A>__{susan and peter collapse on the cement floor in each others arms. heaving and weeping.}

<D>__{it'll be fine... we nailed them before, we'll do it again...}
<A>__{he hurries to meet the mta cops. susan looks up. susan's pov commuters move to and fro, moving up and down and in and out of the illuminated areas of the station. in the crush of onlookers is one deadpan face a mimic, hugging the shadows, waiting for its moment! we pan 180 degrees to the other side of the platform there, briefly glimpsed is another, and another. we tilt down to the throng below.}
