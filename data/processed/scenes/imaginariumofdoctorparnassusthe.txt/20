<L>__{int doctor parnassus' den that moment}
<A>__{doctor parnassus' cabin is tiny. it's packed with books and memorabilia; egyptian assyrian greek etc., magic trick paraphernalia, and much else. a hanging lantern suspended from the ceiling throws moving shadows. dr. parnassus is slumped despondently on a cramped bed. a plate of untouched food sits on a table in front of him. he has laid out tarot cards. to the right the magus.. to the left the devil. the next card is the maiden. he places it carefully beneath the magus. he picks up an open bottle of spirits and takes a swig. clearly he's already had a few drinks.}
<D>__{valentina o s}
<P>__{(cross with him)}
<D>__{you haven't eaten anything.}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{valentina...}
<A>__{she comes in.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{i go to all this trouble and you leave it.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{i'm not hungry.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{are you ill?}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<P>__{(anguished)}
<D>__{valentina... my miraculous child.. i have something to tell you.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{now what?}
<A>__{she starts tidying up.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<P>__{(avoiding the question)}
<D>__{i should never have brought you into this rotten bloody world!}
<C>__{valentina}
<P>__{(she's heard this before)}
<D>__{oh for god's sake!}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{what was i thinking of!}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{percy liked the soup.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<P>__{(agitated)}
<D>__{why does everybody want to live forever?}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{that's normal isn't it?}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{immortality's a curse! any fool can tell you that!}
<A>__{valentina picks up parnassus' nearly empty bottle.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{you know it doesn't agree with you.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<P>__{(in difficulty)}
<D>__{valentina...}
<C>__{valentina}
<P>__{(losing patience)}
<D>__{and i will be sixteen on thursday, so let's not have any more tosh about that.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{listen to me!}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{you think you're so clever and that everybody else is an idiot! you can't stop me growing up just by lying about my birthday! it's ridiculous!}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{shut up! shut up and listen to me! listen to me! i need to tell you something, before it's too late!}
<A>__{dr parnassus reaches up and plucks a glass paperweight out of the air. it's that kind that contains little models which are engulfed in a snow storm when the paperweight is shaken. dr. parnassus shakes the paper weight and watches the `snow' swirl about.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus }
<D>__{one dark winter's night... many years ago...?}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{is this going to take long?}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{quiet!}
<A>__{the camera closes in on and `enters' the paperweight.}
<D>__{dr. parnassus (v.o.) (cont'd) many centuries ago, as a matter of fact...}
