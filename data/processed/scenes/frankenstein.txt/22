<L>__{ext frankenstein estate cemetery day}
<A>__{a baby carriage stands amidst leaning gravestones, gothic and ornate, a chill breeze billowing the lace. a priest recites a latin burial mass. dozens of mourners are gathered before the frankenstein family mausoleum... an imposing edifice of stone and spidery wrought iron, its steepled roof crowned by a massive granite crucifix. a sleek black casket lies atop the bier, ringed with flowers and sorrow. the trees are windswept and bare, branches stark against a steely gray sky. victor and elizabeth stand apart from the others, staring at the casket. softly:}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{how could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{it's not ours to decide. all that live must die. it's god's will.}
<A>__{victor raises a grim look at the huge crucifix atop the mausoleum. christ returns his gaze with blank stone eyes}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{what kind of god is he to will this?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{she was mother to me as well. but ours is the job of the living. it's up to us now to hold this family together. we must think of father and be strong for him.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i cannot do that alone.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{god took her from us.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{he left a beautiful gift in her place. a baby boy. to cherish and love as our very own. your brother}
<A>__{victor glances at the baby carriage. he seeks her hand. their fingers clasp. comfort and strength.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{our brother.}
<A>__{the baby starts crying as the casket is lowered, its thin voice carried on the wind...}
