<C>__{angela}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{john heads across the lanes. swarm gets thicker and thicker. angela keeps up with him, covers her mouth. they approach the pin area of the center lane. the source of the swarm is slowly revealed. in the catch trough is a solid mound of flies. john leans closer, spots a hand protruding from the mound.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh jesus, no }
<A>__{he rips his coat off, flings it at the mound and million flies scatter revealing the body of beeman. ravaged. flies pouring out of his mouth, his ears }

<D>__{who are you?! answer me!! goddamit reveal yourself! i summon you!}
<A>__{he angrily rips his sleeves up revealing two distinct tattoos on his forearms. slams them together with all his might clenching his eyes tight concentrating veins in his arms and neck bulge, look ready to explode angela steps back in awe as the air around his outstretched arms begins to warp to tear a faint hole from the bowling alley right into another world right here darker hellish }
