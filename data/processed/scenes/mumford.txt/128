<L>__{interior mumford's office (present) day}
<A>__{mumford sits beaming at henry follett on the couch. mumford's glance takes in the clock and he stands up, signalling the end of the session. follett snaps out of his revery and gets up.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i'm very happy for you, henry.}
<A>__{mumford, surprisingly, takes follett's hand and shakes it vigorously.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i feel like we're making real progress here.}
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{me too, doc. and i can't tell you what that package meant to me }
<A>__{mumford stops him with a "don't mention it" gesture. follett accepts and goes out the back door. mumford is pleased someone still wants to use that door. mumford returns to his desk and begins reading some papers when he hears the entry door to the waiting room. not expecting anyone, he checks the clock, then goes to his office door and opens it. sofie is standing there, very agitated, just about to knock. she peers past him to see if he's alone.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{i need to talk to you... doctor. can i come in?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{sofie sits on the couch. mumford sits in his chair, facing her. her voice is as strained as her manner.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{we haven't met in this office since that first time. this is how a real professional and his client are supposed to see each other.}
<A>__{mumford waits.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{it might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor patient relationship.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{is something wrong, sofie?}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{yes, something's very wrong, dr. mumford.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{you're upset.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{how intuitive! that must take years of training right there. maybe you can guess what has upset me.}
<A>__{mumford considers a long moment, several scenarios racing through his mind. finally, carefully }
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{is it something you've heard about me?}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{no, it is not something i've heard about you! it is someth }
<P>__{(stops suddenly)}
<D>__{why? is there something i should have heard about you?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{why don't you tell me what's on your mind?}
<A>__{sofie suddenly finds it difficult to look into his eyes, she looks around frenetically for a moment. then, indicating the couch }
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{may i?}
<A>__{mumford gestures "of course." sofie swings her legs up and lies on the couch so they can no longer see each other's face. (it's the most vigorous movement she's yet shown us.) this seems to help sofie a bit.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{all right... i'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{um huh.}
<C>__{sofie}
<P>__{(tone still rough)}
<D>__{first of all, i have been feeling much better lately. i don't know if the syndrome is over if it's just run its course or something but i feel a hundred per cent better than when i first came to you.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i'm glad.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{given that, i'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i don't follow you.}
<C>__{sofie}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{i'm saying that since i'm doing so much better which i attribute to you i'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.}
<C>__{mumford}
<P>__{(tentative)}
<D>__{okay...}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{the point is this i am not a blank page. i did not just fall off the turnip truck. do you know what i mean?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{i know a little about psychology. i took three different courses in college. it's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but i took them... and there was one concept i remember very well.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{transference!}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{transference.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{yes, and that is what i have got right now. i have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. i have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... so that now i am under the delusion...}
<P>__{(a deep breath)}
<D>__{...that i am in love with you.}
<A>__{mumford appears frozen in his chair. there is a heavy silence in the room. sofie does not look back there.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{i think you can understand why i have some serious questions about your methods. i mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that i'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make outs ville and do all these highly romantic activities }
<A>__{suddenly, sofie's voice cracks. she is starting to cry, but refuses to acknowledge it.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{ we had a paper route together, for godssake! do you understand how i might be a little resentful? knowing that this so called "love" i'm feeling is totally bogus, and just a pathetic case of... transference?}
<A>__{mumford doesn't know what to say. he's on the rack. finally }
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{silence. then sofie gets up, wiping at tears with the back of her bare hand. mumford jumps up to offer her a tissue, but she ignores it. she will not meet his gaze.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{maybe you ought to think about how you're going to fix this. and when you do...}
<P>__{(suddenly losing her will)}
<D>__{...please get back to me.}
<A>__{sofie turns to go out through the waiting room, but after a step, she stops, pirouettes and goes out the back.}
