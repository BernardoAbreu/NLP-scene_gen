<L>__{interior living room day [a few minutes later]}
<A>__{close on a white plastic device mounted in the corner of the room, about ten feet up. it might be a smoke detector. gary stares up at it, intently. he steps forward. a little red light flicks on inside the unit. after a few seconds it turns off. it's some sort of motion detector. gary tests it again, trying to move his arm slowly enough that the light never engages. margaret enters, carrying two mugs. she watches him warily.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{tell me about the nines.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{the nines?}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{the nines.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{sort of hard to start there...}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{try. and don't tell me i'm imagining it. they're showing up everywhere, and i want to know why.}
<A>__{trying to formulate the simplest truthful explanation:}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{best guess? they're your subconscious trying to remind you who you are.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{i'm a nine?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{yes. it doesn't make a lot of sense of out contexterior}
<P>__{(offering)}
<D>__{coffee?}
<A>__{he takes the mug, then reconsiders. maybe it's laced with something.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{why don't you drink coffee? you're always drinking tea.}
<A>__{frustrated, she takes his coffee back and drinks it. she'd really like to drink the whole thing to prove her point, but it's just too hot.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{happy?}
<A>__{she gestures for him to sit down. reluctantly, he does. she sits across from him.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{you're not going to understand this yet, but we've known each other for like 25 years. one day when i was 12, you called me out of the blue. and we've been talking ever since.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{talking.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{on the phone. usually.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{i never met you before i came here.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{you, gary, never met me. but you're not always...}
<P>__{(lacking the words)}
<D>__{i can understand why you're a little confused.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{no. i'm a lot confused.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{theories?}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{this is all a dream.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{i'm in a coma.}
<C>__{margaret}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{then i'm dead. this is hell, or purgatorium or something.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{okay, a purgatorium is where romans vomited. but no. this is as real as anything can be.}
<C>__{gary}
<P>__{(suspicious)}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<A>__{she sits forward in her chair. by instinct, he sits back.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{everything is what it is. but you're not who you think you are.}
<A>__{new angle (time jump) gary gets up, headed for the front door.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{god, no! please, gary, don't.}
<A>__{but he's already outside.}
