<L>__{exterior restrooms afternoon}
<A>__{jenny points to the sign on the next door.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{men. you go in here.}
<A>__{she cracks the door for him.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{he takes the door from her and pushes it open for a look inside. jenny ducks into the ladies' room. he is confused for a moment then takes a long look at the men's room. it means nothing to him. he backs out and tries the ladies' room. it is locked. not knowing what to do, the star man stands uncomfortably in front of the door, then like a child waiting for his mother, he sits on the curb. he watches the attendant lift the mustang's hood and reach in for the dipstick. the numbers on the pumps turn over, adding up the gallons and the cost of the gas. everything is peaceful and quiet within the circle of light cast by the gas station. the star man pulls the camera disc out of his pocket and points it at the pumps. the cone of light flashes out and pulls back its three dimensional image. the attendant turns around and waves genially at the star man, who waves back a perfect imitation of the gesture. the sharp rumble of a souped up honda motorcycle coming up the off ramp shatters the mood and the star man gets to his feet. he is startled by the image of the rider. in a one piece driving skin and helmet he looks amazingly like a space traveller. the star man steps cautiously forward for a better look and mutters something to himself in his language. the rider stops his bike at the second row of pumps and swings himself stiffly out of the seat.}

<C>__{rider}
<P>__{(over his shoulder)}
<D>__{fill it up.}
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{you got it.}
<A>__{the rider's approach frightens the star man. he backs up to the ladies' room door and knocks. there is no answer. he tries the knob. with the other hand he inches the gun slightly out of his pocket.}
