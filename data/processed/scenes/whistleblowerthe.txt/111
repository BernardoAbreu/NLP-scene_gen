<A>__{kathy swerves up. viko has the van parked right up against the door. kathy jumps out.}
<L>__{interior foyer gda bosnia moments later}
<A>__{laura leads a very scared raya out. kathy smiles, gentle.}
<C>__{kathy}
<P>__{(at laura) where's irka?}
<A>__{laura takes a deep breath, eyeing raya...}
<C>__{laura levin}
<D>__{i need to have a word with you.}
<A>__{kathy looks at her watch at raya. viko taps her shoulder.}
<C>__{viko}
<D>__{i will take her. meet us when you're done.}
<A>__{as viko and raya leave, kathy stops her...}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{i will be right behind you. are you okay?}
<A>__{raya nods, trusting in kathy. who turns, angry, back to...}
<C>__{laura levin}
<D>__{i was going to call you. there was a problem. during our repatriation procedures, we realized irka had no passport.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{so we get her one. where is she?}
<C>__{laura levin}
<D>__{you don't get it. she was trafficked from belgrade. her parents were killed in kosovo. and she has no documentation. no embassy will recognize her. she is a girl without a country.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{she is a witness for a un investigation!}
<A>__{gda employees peer. an intern betrays a twinge of complicity.}
<C>__{laura levin}
<D>__{we handed her over to the police a few hours ago. i couldn't keep her. i've already done every favour i could for you. this is not on me.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{you had no right to do that!}
<C>__{laura levin}
<D>__{i had every right. we have a system that works here. you're the one disrupting it.}
<A>__{kathy stares at her. fuming.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{where did they take her?}
<A>__{laura shrugs. shaking off guilt has become a necessary habit. just then the door opens. and...}
<B>__{halyna}
<A>__{walks in. disoriented, emotion rising...}
<C>__{halyna }
<D>__{i... look for laura levin?}
<C>__{laura levin }
<D>__{that's me.}
<A>__{kathy holds her anger, smiling respectfully at halyna. laura leads her away. kathy searches for an answer, her eyes landing on... the intern. unrelenting...}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{if you know anything, this is on you.}
<C>__{intern}
<D>__{i think the cops leave them somewhere near the border, so that with no papers, the girls have to cross the border illegally. take the 103 to visegrad.}
