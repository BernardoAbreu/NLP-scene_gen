<L>__{interior appliance store (matrix) day}
<A>__{trinity can almost feel him watching them. every unanswered ring wrings her gut a little tighter, until }
<C>__{cypher }
<D>__{hello, trinity.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{cypher? where's tank?}
<C>__{cypher }
<D>__{he had an accident.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{an accident? what about dozer? is dozer there?}
<L>__{interior main deck}
<A>__{he walks over to trinity's body, staring down at it hanging in its coma like stillness.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{you know, for a long time, i thought i was in love with you, trinity. i used to dream about you...}
<A>__{he nuzzles his face against hers, feeling the softness of it.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{you are a beautiful woman. too bad things had to work out like this.}
<A>__{we intercut between : the appliance store and the main deck.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{you killed them.}
<C>__{apoc}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{switch}
<D>__{oh god.}
<A>__{wearing tank's operator headgear, cypher moves among the silent bodies.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{in a way you're very lucky. most people never know why they die. one minute they're alive, the next they're dead. no warning. nothing. that's why i thought maybe i should tell you. it seemed the least i could do.}
<A>__{he stands over the body of morpheus, as his anger boils up out of him.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{you see, the truth, the real,truth is that the war is over. it's been over for a long time. and guess what? we lost! did you hear that? we lost the war!}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{what about zion?}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{zion? zion is a part of this delusion. more of this madness. that's why this has to be done. it has to end. now and forever.}
<A>__{she suddenly sees the entire dark plan.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{oh rny god. this is abzut zion. you gave them morpheus for the access codes to zion.}
<A>__{cypher walks away from morpheus and bends down next to apoc's body.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{you see, trinity, we humans have a place in the future. but it's not here. it's in the matrix.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{the matrix isn't real!}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{oh, i disagree, trinity. i disagree. i think the matrix is more real than this world. i mean, all i do is pull a plug here. but there, you watch a man die.}
<A>__{he grabs hold of the cable in apoc's neck, twists it and yanks it out.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{you tell me which is more real.}
<A>__{apoc seems to go blind for an instant, a scream caught in his throat, his hands reaching for nothing, and then falls dead. switch screams.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{welcome to the real world, right?}
<A>__{he laughs.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{somehow, some way, you're going to pay for this.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{pay for it? i'm not even going to remember it. it'll be like it never happened. the tree falling in the forest. it doesn't make a sound.}
<A>__{his hand slides around the neck of switch as he takes hold of her plug. she suddenly feels her body severed from her mind as she is murdered.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{goddamn you, cypher!}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{don't hate me, trinity. i'm just the messenger. and right now i'm going to prove that the message is true.}
<A>__{he stands over neo.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{if morpheus was right, then there's no way i can pull this plug, is there?}
<A>__{she turns to neo, eyes wide with fear, and he knows he is nexterior}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{if he is the one, then in the next few seconds there has to be some kind of miracle to stop me. because if he dies like the others that means morpheus was wrong. how can he be the one if he's dead?}
<A>__{he takes hold of the cord when she hears an explosion and a scream. cypher is on the ground, his left leg blown off at the knee. he rolls over and finds tank on the ground, and the sights of the plasma rifle.}
<C>__{tank}
<D>__{how's it feel, cypher? knowing you're about to die?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{it's tank! he's alive.}
<A>__{cypher lunges for neo's plug just as tank blows his head off.}
