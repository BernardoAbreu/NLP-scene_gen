<L>__{exterior clasky house driveway day}
<A>__{as john gets in his seat..then sees flor approaching the door and hops out to open her door...apologizing as he goes.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{sorry. i'm cracking.}
<A>__{as he moves back to his side of the vehicle.}
<C>__{john }
<P>__{(a shout)}
<D>__{shiiiiiiit!}
<A>__{flor hears this from inside and nods in agreement.}
<L>__{interior john's car early evening..}
<A>__{as they drive down the canyon. he is wildly frustrated. even if flor were not there, he would be talking to himself anyway, in the manner of bag ladies and all of us.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{i am running out of excuses for the lady of the house.}
<A>__{flor doesn't understand his words...yet fully agrees. but then john takes rein of his emotions.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{but you know, you gotta watch out for the times you think you're absolutely right..but, man, bernice has finals tomorrow. she didn't need this one..and just that look on her face when she got the gifts }
<P>__{(now his voice cracks; he grows wet eyed)}
<D>__{ like for a second she thought all her problems with her mother had been solved...}
<A>__{flor is flabbergasted..she peeks to see if he is actually crying. at first her heart is touched by john but then there is distinct disapproval (a real roll of the eyes) that the macho meter can read that low. he looks at her and she faces front quickly.}
<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{my mother did not understand her male boss. his heart was good and he was rare in not flirting with her. but they were starkly different. privacy and dignity were the same word to my mother. naturally, when she found herself sitting next to a man who cried over his child's hurt she had no idea how to process the event.}
<A>__{meanwhile, he has stopped for traffic near the end of the canyon. flor takes the opportunity to bolt.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{gracias.}
<A>__{she opens the door and starts to get out though the car is still rolling a bit...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what are you doing? let me take you all the way.}
<A>__{reluctantly she re enters the car..it rolls another ten feet to her bus stop and she gets out again.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{how weird was this ride? sorry.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{no es nada.}
<A>__{he doesn't quite know what that means...indicates same in a little helpless gesture..}
