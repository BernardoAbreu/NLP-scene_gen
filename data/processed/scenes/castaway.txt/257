<L>__{interior u.s. naval hospital hawaii}
<A>__{a cavernous hanger sized ward brightly lit and filled with row upon row of hospital beds, each with its table, side chair, and lamp, each with a stainless steel bedpan and neatly folded sheets and blankets stacked ready to use, and each completely empty. except for one. and on that bed we see chuck, in a blue hospital gown. an iv drips into his arm. he plays idly with the remote control of the bed. he raises the head, then the foot. he pushes another button and the knee rest bends the bed again. a doctor enters, carrying a thick chart. chuck gives him a big manic grin. malcolm macdowell in "a clockwork orange."}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{my favorite doctor. what's the verdict?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{under the circumstances your overall health is good. those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.}
<A>__{he checks his blood work records.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{hemoglobin's 10.8 you're anemic, that's why we're giving you iron. potassium's low we're giving you an electrolyte solution with your iv. sodium's over 150, way too high. you may experience swelling in your extremities as you rehydrate and discharge the salt. in spite of your dietary deficiencies there's no sign of mental deterioration.}
<A>__{chuck has been trying not to laugh. now he can't stop himself.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{what's so funny.}
<A>__{chuck can't seem to help laughing at everything.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{sorry...sorry... why do my joints still ache?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{dehydration. vitamin deficiency. protein deficiency. any or all of the above.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{all i ate was fish. that's solid protein.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{protein digestion is very costly in water usage.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{which i didn't have.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{and fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient. so you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat. luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some vitamin c, so you didn't get scurvy.}
<A>__{chuck laughs again.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i am one lucky guy.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self reproach. it's almost like schizophrenia. different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{but all that's behind me. i'm fine now.}
<A>__{he starts to laugh again.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{if you say you are.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i most definitely say i am.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{doctor hegel tells me he discussed the vietnam pow syndrome with you.}
<A>__{chuck stifles his laughter.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{yes, yes he did.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{you are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{not to mention on me.}
<A>__{the laughter again. unsettling.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{you sure you don't want some counseling?}
<A>__{chuck gives his biggest smile.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{doc, i'm not on the island. i'm not on the raft. i'm alive. i'm so glad to be back, i can't tell you. i just want out of here.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{well, when that iv runs out, you're through with us. just the dentist tomorrow.}
