<P>__{(to zeke)}
<D>__{ah, typical robot. the first earth chick we see in ten years, and he's gotta make a play for her.}
<A>__{edsel jams the gearshift into 'd' for drive, and the ship lifts away from earth.}
<C>__{zeke}
<D>__{hey, do we have any of that plutonian nyborg left?}
<C>__{edsel}
<D>__{uh, yeah. just one bag. uh, it's in the transmitter compartment.}
<C>__{zeke}
<D>__{uh, thanks man.}
<A>__{zeke opens a hatch and pulls out a double spouted plastic bag on wheels the size of a steamer trunk. it is full of white powder. he pours two fifteen foot lines of powder onto the floor. then, he pauses.}
<C>__{zeke}
<P>__{(surveying the lines)}
<D>__{oh great. think this is enough?}
<C>__{edsel}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{uhh ... nah. go for broke.}
<C>__{zeke}
<D>__{good thinking, man.}
<A>__{as he resumes pouring, zeke begins singing to himself in an alien tongue. when the lines are poured, they both stand at the start of the trail of white powder, and part their hair to reveal nostrils hidden in their foreheads.}
<D>__{zeke & edsel nose dive!}
<A>__{they both start to criss cross the room, inhaling the white powder like vaccuum cleaners. as they happily snort the nyborg, the camera pans back to the glass receiving jar, and moves down through the broken pieces of doctor anrak. reaching his lifeless face, the camera moves around to the back of the head. through the shattered metal we can see a green ball, glowing inside anrak's skullpiece.}
