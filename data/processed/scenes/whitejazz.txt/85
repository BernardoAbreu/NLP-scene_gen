<A>__{loading shells into the shotgun that was atop that jello mold. back into the kitchen. exhale. begin blasting. massive noise. six shots. reload fast: nothing can muffle this clatter. second volley. eyes closed to keep chunks of drywall out. gagging on gunsmoke. rip at the safe something gives. third volley. the safe hits the floor, leaves a hole. through the ringing in my ears: something that sounds like honks. quick peek: pete gone. a black buick with two white walled feds up front. then junior gets out of the backseat... scoop the freezer drugs, the stack of man porn, the snapshots, and toss a whole armful into the hallway in front of junior's door. grab the green banded evidence bag and tuck it under my arm. back into the kitchenette. turn on the gas but don't light the burners. pull the grenade off the wall. drag the safe to the rear of his place: the fire escape.}
