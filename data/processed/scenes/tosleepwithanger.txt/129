<A>__{the preacher turns a page in the bible. gideon has his mouth open like a fish trying to get air. the choir continues to sing. the preacher gets down on his knees and holds gideon's hand; he bows his head. the choir stops singing. the bessie smith recording of "muddy water" is coming from somewhere in the house. the preacher looks around. suzie is more puzzled. she goes to find where the music is coming from.}
