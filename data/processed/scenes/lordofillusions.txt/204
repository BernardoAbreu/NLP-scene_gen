<A>__{on swann, dragging his broken body to the door.}
<L>__{interior nix's house passageway night}
<B>__{on harry}
<A>__{literally beating his head against the wall!}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no! no! no!}
<C>__{dorothea }
<D>__{harry...}
<A>__{harry stops. dare he believe this is truly her voice?}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{it's not real, harry }
<A>__{harry turns around. dorothea is there. harry's p.o.v. for a moment, he sees dorothea as she is. on harry, relief flooding his face. then harry's p.o.v. the image morphs. dorothea's beauty is replaced by primeval muck. on harry, appalled. dorothea grabs hold of him.}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{harry. listen to me. whatever's good between us, believe it.}
<A>__{harry's face is deathly white, and pouring sweat. he's fighting the delirium. or doing his best.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{... oh... god...}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{i'm here, harry.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{...yes?}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{nix steps from the shadows of the doorway behind harry.}
<C>__{nix}
<P>__{(to dorothea)}
<D>__{there you are, child.}
<A>__{harry starts to look round.}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{don't look.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i... have... to.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{come on, child. i want swann to see you die.}
<A>__{harry turns and looks at nix. harry's p.o.v. nix's face darkens as it morphs. and the flesh in the middle of his brow unfolds, revealing a dark, pulsating third eye.}
<C>__{nix}
<P>__{(to harry)}
<D>__{what are you looking at?}
<A>__{on dorothea, who has gone to the door of the meditation room and now slips inside. on harry, staring up at nix. on dorothea, re emerging from the meditation room. in her hand, harry's gun. harry looks round at her.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(points to his brow)}
<D>__{there... there!}
<A>__{on nix, as he looks up at dorothea. on dorothea, as she raises the gun. she fires. the bullet strikes nix's forehead. he sinks to his knees, blood pouring down his face from the hole where his third eye used to be. on harry, as nix's mind hold falters. he leans against the wall, shaking.}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{harry?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm okay. i'm okay.}
<A>__{harry opens his eyes. looks up at her. harry's p.o.v. the last of the morphing fades. he sees dorothea as she actually is. dorothea goes down to comfort him, and they embrace. suddenly, a roar from nix. they look towards him it isn't over. one last, terrifying transformation is overtaking nix as he kneels in the glass. his sallow flesh is running in streams up his body towards the dark hole in the middle of his forehead }
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{one... last... illusion...}
<A>__{ his humanity is disappearing, vanishing into the vortex of the bullet wound.}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<A>__{harry and dorothea start to get up... nix is no longer human. he is a shape of gleaming darkness, stripped of features. he opens his mouth, the only visible element on his body is his toothed maw, which looses an utterly inhuman shriek!}
<C>__{swann }
<D>__{... d'amour...}
<A>__{harry glances through the door into the meditation room. swann is on the threshold. nix rises now. he is a terrifying spectacle, his bulk somehow more intimidating than ever in this simplified form. he comes at dorothea, who has no choice but to back away into the meditation room.}
