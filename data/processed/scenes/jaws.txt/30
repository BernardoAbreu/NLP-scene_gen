<L>__{exterior ocean day}
<A>__{ben gardner's boat is in the lead with gardner's shouting derisive comments at the crowd headed out from land. the armada is spread out and moving in a ragged circle, fifteen boats in all. one man heaves cherry bombs into the water. a smaller boat going in the opposite direction offers us barwood, forking spaghetti leftovers into the ocean while his friend pours out a bottle of ketchup. a speedboat chugs by, one of the occupants reading instructions aloud from a book entitled "sharks east coast, vol. i." boatload of impoverished scallop fishermen throw a net overboard, full of gaps and split ends. the professionals look professional, but the landlubbers out for the $3000 make it impossible for everybody. collisions are barely averted.}
<B>__{the rube goldberg error}
<A>__{the out of towner in a small boat is bent over in a life and death struggle, his rod in a tight arc. his buddy leaps across to lend a hand. twenty yards away in another boat the same struggle ensues. this time it's the overloaded boat with the poor scallop fishermen. shouts of i'm on! dig in! strike! then a tangle of tackle springs from the water. they have hooked each other. joy turns to swearing. arnold felix stands up to applaud the mishap, while his buddy pratt takes careful aim with his remington 1100 12 gauge and blasts at the tackle as if it were a clay pigeon. the tangle explodes both the out of towners and the scallop fisherman falls over backward angle harry's boat three men are aboard, one holding a rod which holds a fast arc. a few yards off stern we see a triangular dorsal fin crossing back and forth, struggling, jerking, the mighty tail threshing. one man is screaming success, the other two slapping the angler on the back. close pratt and felix they spot it and sour.}
<C>__{pratt}
<D>__{well, get over there! he ain't caught it yet!}
<A>__{the owner of pratt's boat throws it forward and pratt removes a .45 automatic from the holster of his belt. he tests it, firing once in the air. as they near the scene of the struggle, eleven other boats begin converging, until harry's boat everyone wants to get into the act. they are attacking the threshing beast with all they've got. pratt uses his automatic, another blasts point blank with a shotgun. there are occasional water ricochets and the bounty hunters duck from time to time as bullets skip by. finally, the shark stops threshing.}
<B>__{felix and pratt}
<A>__{their boat has moved close to the shark, closer than harry's.}
<C>__{pratt}
<P>__{(exultant)}
<D>__{hand me that pole! quick!}
<A>__{one of his party in the over filled boat grabs a gaff and leans out to grab the moribund shark. but harry won't give up the line, still reeling in.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{beat it! i hooked him!}
<C>__{pratt}
<D>__{how's the family, harry?}
<P>__{(to the man with gaff)}
<D>__{go on and do it!}
<C>__{man with gaff}
<D>__{we split down the middle?}
<A>__{pratt nods reluctantly. the man swings, lodges the gaff and hauls the shark up onto the gunwale. a paroxysm of cheers from the surrounding boats. smoke flares are fired into the air.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(a tug of war)}
<D>__{let go my shark!}
<A>__{it is a ten foot tiger, and what a mess splattered with bullet punctures, gashes, bleeding from several orifices. but it is not dead it kicks back to life and threatens to capsize the boat. pratt panics and fires six times with his .45. the bullets pierce the shark's head, pass through, and split the fiberglass hull through which a flood of water rises. everybody stands up as the boat slips beneath them.}
