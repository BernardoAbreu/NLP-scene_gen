<L>__{exterior ditch day}
<A>__{its on the side of jersey turnpike. there is a pop and craig falls from nowhere into the ditch. he is soaking wet, and now dirty from the ditch. he stands, looks confusedly around, sees a n.j. turnpike sign. after a moment, he goes to the side of the road and sticks out his thumb.}

<L>__{interior maxine's office later}
<A>__{maxine sits behind her desk with her feet up, and talks on the phone.}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{absolutely, doll. i'm just about to close up here.}
<A>__{craig walks in disheveled and exhausted. maxine sees him, keeps talking.}
<C>__{maxine }
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{meet you at the pig in twenty minutes.}
<P>__{(laughs lasciviously)}
<D>__{oh yeah, maybe i will keep my legs closed till then.}
<P>__{(hangs up. to craig)}
<D>__{i'm splitting for the day. lock up for me, won't you, darling.}
<A>__{maxine stands, puts some stuff in her purse.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{don't you want to know what happened to me?}
<C>__{maxine}
<P>__{(considers)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{maxine heads for the door. craig grabs her arm.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{this is important!}
<C>__{maxine}
<P>__{(looking at his hand on her arm)}
<D>__{it better be.}
<A>__{craig sits maxine down in a chair, lets go of her arm.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{there's a tiny door in that empty office. it's a portal, maxine. it takes you inside john malkovich. you see the world through john malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpike.}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{sounds delightful. who the fuck is john malkovich?}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{he's an actor. one of the great american actors of the 20th century.}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{what's he been in?}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{lots of things. he's very well respected. that jewel thief movie, for example. the point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. it raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. am i me? is malkovich malkovich? was the buddha right, is duality an illusion? do you see what a can of worms this portal is? i don't think i can go on living my life as i have lived it. there's only one thing to do. let's get married right away.}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{is this malkovich fellow appealing?}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{yes, of course. he's a celebrity.}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{good. we'll sell tickets.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{tickets to malkovich?}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{exactly. two hundred dollars a pop.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{but there's something profound here, maxine, we can't exploit it.}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{fine. i will do it myself. i was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{you wanted to be partners with me?}
<C>__{maxine}
<P>__{(bored)}
<D>__{sure. it'd be fun.}
<C>__{craig}
<P>__{(pleased)}
<D>__{really?}
<P>__{(then:)}
<D>__{but, maxine, can of worms! end of the world! illusory nature of existence!}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{i will protect you, dollface.}
<A>__{maxine reaches over and squeezes his lips affectionately between her thumb and forefinger.}
<C>__{craig}
<P>__{(in love)}
<D>__{oh. maxine.}
