<L>__{interior bookstore day}
<A>__{hannah sits behind the table, signing books. maureen stands behind her helping to orchestrate the line of people. hannah acts very gracious. signing a book, smiling and chatting up the guests. she seems at ease. everything is going her way. she looks past the line. her eyes light up and she jumps to her feet.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{oh my god!}
<A>__{hannah bolts from the table, cuts through the line and finds henry standing alone.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{hi, hannah.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{henry. ohhhhh. thank you. thank you. thank you so much for coming.}
<A>__{hannah throws her arms around henry, giving him a long heartfelt hug, almost smothering the poor guy not that he complains. she lets go and gives henry a friendly once over.}
<C>__{hannah }
<D>__{you're the only one from the group who showed up.}
<A>__{still awkward for them to be around each other.}
<C>__{hannah }
<D>__{i can't believe you remembered my signing.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{well, pretty hard to miss that article about you in people magazine. just wanted to say hi. and congratulations.}
<A>__{maureen comes up behind hannah. beams at henry, and waves.}
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{hello, henry.}
<P>__{(to hannah)}
<D>__{hannah, come back. your public awaits.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{go on. they need you.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{please stay.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{can't. sorry.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{yeah. hot date. you know. can't keep her waiting. a flight attendant.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(buying the obvious lie)}
<D>__{a flight attendant?}
<A>__{henry nods.}
<C>__{hannah }
<D>__{well, then. guess you can't stay.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{one sec. wait here.}
<A>__{hannah runs back to the signing table, pulls out a book and scribbles something inside. she brings the book back over to henry.}
<C>__{hannah }
<D>__{this is for you.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(protesting)}
<D>__{hannah . . .}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{take it.}
<A>__{henry accepts the book. hannah gives him another long hug.}
<C>__{hannah }
<D>__{do you want to say hello to richard?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{no. no, thanks.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{c'mon. it will take just a minute.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i can't. really.}
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{dear, sweet hannah. please!}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{just say hi.}
<A>__{henry tries to back away. hannah leans forward, grabs his hand and tugs him in the other direction.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i've really got to }
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{oh, c'mon. you'll }
<A>__{then bam, henry, not looking where he's going, slams into richard accidentally, spilling richard's drink all over the author. horrified looks all around.}
