<L>__{exterior courtyard day}
<A>__{the carpark is jammed with cars but there is hardly anyone in sight. mark hurries towards the large sliding doors of stage e they are a few feet apart. he looks round carefully, then slips inside.}
<L>__{interior stage e. day}
<A>__{facing mark is the darkened set of an hotel bedroom. beyond this is another set also in darkness and beyond this yet another. only in the far comer of the studio in the furthermost set is there a light burning. voices can faintly be heard coming from this set. mark walks quietly towards a long ladder which leads up to the gantry. carefully rung by rung he starts to climb the ladder. at the top of the ladder is a gallery. mark moves along the maze of bridges until he is nearly above the policemen. mark raises his head cautiously and looks down. far below we can see the inspector standing next to the doctor a tall, silver haired man who is peering into an open trunk. detectives are photographing the set. mark raises his cine camera... its gentle purring seems to echo round the studio. close shot of mark's jacket pocket. a row of pencils is sticking out. as he leans forward the pencils tilt. through the finder matte of mark's camera we see the inspector very far away peering into the trunk and nodding. a faint echo of conversation is overlaid.}
<C>__{doctor }
<D>__{no doubt at all... wounds were caused by the same instrument...}
<A>__{mark changes lens (and alters the finder to a 75mm lens). the doctor's face thin and impersonal appears in the finder over the lid of the trunk.}
<C>__{doctor }
<D>__{... both women... subjected to the most violent shock...}
<C>__{inspector }
<D>__{what sort of shock?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{...still cannot determine but look!}
<A>__{he points to something in the trunk out of the camera's eye line. close shot of mark. he balances carefully then raises the camera above his head. as he leans forward, the pencils fall. we see them shooting like small torpedoes into the darkness below. they make three separate landings. close shot of the inspector. looking up. from his pov we see tiers of scaffolding deep in shadow...}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{quiet, everyone. please...}
<A>__{the detectives make as much noise to become quiet as the normal occupants of the studio and then there is complete silence. complete, except for the doctor's asthmatic breathing... and then so gently that it might almost be in our own minds we hear a purring sound from the shadows above. the inspector listens intently.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{i thought i heard a putty cat!}
<A>__{there is a burst of laughter the inspector frowns.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{i don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but we do have a maniac on our hands, and if we don't get him quickly there'll be a third unsolved murder to report to the commissioner. so let's hurry things up, shall we?}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{sorry, chief!}
<A>__{the 'putty cat' detective raises his flashlamp towards the trunk counter. in the brilliant flash of light that ensues, we glimpse a shadowy figure moving towards a ladder high in the scaffolding... but then we are looking for it no one else is. the flashlight dies away. the scene fades with it. close shot of a knitting needle held upwards. another knitting needle scales down it like a fireman descending a ladder.}
