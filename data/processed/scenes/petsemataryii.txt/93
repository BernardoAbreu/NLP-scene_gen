<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{geoff is riding along the highway, his backpack full of school books. drew is waiting on the shoulder ahead. when geoff approaches, drew hops on his bike, getting up to speed. with the boys riding geoff keeps glancing at drew, waiting for him to say something. drew maintains his enigmatic expression.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{well?}
<A>__{drew nods. geoff's eyes widen in disbelief.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{picture this... gus comes down to breakfast and he doesn't say a word. he even kind of smiles, like he forgot he hates me. and then you know what he does? he serves me an extra helping of pancakes...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i asked him if i was still grounded... "no." i asked him if you could spend the night, and he nods. it's like we're a family. a real family.}
<A>__{the words have their own meaning for geoff, who stares to the road ahead in deep thought.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{it's weird...}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{it's like he's not gus anymore. he's different. you know, like zowie...}
<A>__{they share a chuckle that ends in silent uneasiness.}
