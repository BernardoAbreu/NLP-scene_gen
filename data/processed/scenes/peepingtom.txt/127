<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior restaurant night}
<A>__{a small and very pleasant restaurant, almost full. helen and mark have a corner table. they are dining by candlelight, and there is a bottle of wine in the middle of the table. as camera tracks towards them, helen is laughing.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i like this place! and this dinner!}
<A>__{close shot of mark. he has again won the academy award.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{...thank you, mark...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{are you ready to talk about your book?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i'm ready to talk about you...}
<A>__{his face falls.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{it won't take a second and it's best to have it said.}
<A>__{mark looks.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{carrying a camera is only one of your habits, isn't it, mark?}
<A>__{he looks at her in silence. close shot of helen.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{... when you stared at that couple, you were like the little boy on that film you showed me... looking over the wall at something he shouldn't see. but mark you're strong enough now to lift that child off the wall... aren't you?}
<A>__{he hesitates.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{... aren't you?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i will try to be.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{will you, mark?... will you really?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{lecture finished...}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{when your book's published will you go on working in a library?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{yes, mark... in case, one day, a child comes in and asks for it!}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i will come in.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i'm not popular with my customers! they ask me for horror comics and i take their sticky hands and drag them to where there are books!}
<A>__{close shot of helen.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{... and do you know, mark, waiting for them to come in next time and ask for books... is as exciting... as a horror comic...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what does your magic camera photograph?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{people...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes?...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{it's owned by a little boy who is terrified of grown ups... but when he looks in his magic camera he sees grown ups as they were when they were children... and he isn't frightened any longer.}
<A>__{close shot of mark listening, engrossed.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{... and one day he gives his camera away to a little boy who is even more frightened of grown ups than he was and do you know what he finds?}
<A>__{the little boy opposite her shakes his head.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{... that when he looks at grown ups without his camera he can still see them as they were when they were children! and that means that he's grown up himself...}
<A>__{a moment's pause. she drinks her wine shy, awaiting his reaction.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what made you think of this story?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you did!}
<A>__{close shot of mark.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{... i looked out of my window and saw you going off to work carrying that camera like a little boy with a satchel... and an idea came... so thank you...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'd like to think... i was responsible... in some way...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{now what do i do about the photographs?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{take 'em!}
<A>__{he slams the table so violently that a lady nearby looks around... then reaches for his camera.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{oh!}
<A>__{helen smiles.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{there isn't a single face that doesn't look like a child's not a single one if you catch it at the right moment.}
<A>__{he turns around excitedly and sees her watching him.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it would be a challenge!... unlike anything i've photographed!}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what have you photographed, mark?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{everything. but nothing i'd want children to see.}
<A>__{she looks at him curiously.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{but this would belong to them and they'd know if it wasn't right... oh, helen... i would like to find those faces for you... with you...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{very well! let's try!}
<A>__{he laughs excitedly... she looks regretfully at her watch. at once he looks at his.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you made a promise to your mother }
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{yes, mark...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you'd better keep it.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{thank you...}
<A>__{he signals to the head waiter... and pays his first bill for two.}
