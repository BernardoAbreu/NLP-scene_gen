<T>__{dissolve to:}
<B>__{the luxurious lobby of the hotel clarence}
<A>__{camera moves to a close shot of the desk. in the background is a revolving door leading to the street. through the revolving door comes a strangely dressed individual, obviously one who doesn't belong in such surroundings. it is comrade buljanoff, a member of the russian board of trade. despite the spring climate of paris, he still wears his typical russian clothes, consisting of a coat with a fur collar, a fur cap, and heavy boots. buljanoff glances around the lobby, obviously over whelmed by its magnificence. the manager, puzzled by buljanoff's strange appearance, approaches him.}
<C>__{manager}
<P>__{(politely)}
<D>__{is there anything i can do for you, monsieur?}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{no, no.}
<A>__{he exits toward the street. the manager returns to his customary duties, when suddenly a second russian, similarly dressed, pushes his way through the door and gazes around. it is comrade iranoff. the manager, definitely mystified by now, approaches him.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{yes, monsieur?}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{just looking around.}
<A>__{iranoff exits. again the manager returns to his duties, when suddenly he sees that a third man, dressed in the same fashion, has appeared in the revolving door. it is comrade kopalski. kopalski doesn't leave the revolving door at all but as it turns, drinks in the whole spectacle of the lobby. the manager is by now dumfounded.}
<B>__{street in front of the hotel clarence}
<A>__{a taxi stands at the curb. buljanoff and iranoff are waiting beside it, iranoff holding a suitcase. kopalski, returning from the hotel, joins the group.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{comrades, why should we lie to each other? it's wonderful.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{let's be honest. have we anything like it in russia?}
<C>__{all three}
<P>__{(agreeing with him)}
<D>__{no, no, no.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{can you imagine what the beds would be in a hotel like that?}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{they tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? a maid comes in a french maid.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<P>__{(with a gleam in his eye)}
<D>__{comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<P>__{(stopping him)}
<D>__{just a minute just a minute i have nothing against the idea but i still say let's go back to the hotel terminus. moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{where is your courage, comrade buljanoff?}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{are you the buljanoff who fought on the barricades? and now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<P>__{(stepping back into the taxi)}
<D>__{i don't want to go to siberia.}
<A>__{iranoff and kopalski follow him reluctantly.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{i don't want to go to the hotel terminus.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{if lenin were alive he would say, "buljanoff, comrade, for once in your life you're in paris. don't be a fool. go in there and ring three times."}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{he wouldn't say that. what he would say is "buljanoff, you can't afford to live in a cheap hotel. doesn't the prestige of the bolsheviks mean anything to you? do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all? phooey, buljanoff!"}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<P>__{(weakening)}
<D>__{i still say our place is with the common people, but who am i to contradict lenin? let's go in.}
<A>__{all three start to leave the taxi, as we}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{lobby hotel clarence at the desk buljanoff, iranoff, and kopalski are approaching the manager, their only suitcase carried by two of them.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{are you the manager?}
<C>__{manager}
<P>__{(eyeing the three suspiciously)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{kopalski}

<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{may i ask how much your rooms are?}
<C>__{manager}
<P>__{(trying to get rid of them)}
<D>__{well, gentlemen, i'm afraid our rates are rather high.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{why should you be afraid?}
<A>__{the other two nod their agreement. the manager has noted the single suitcase.}
<C>__{manager}
<P>__{(haughtily)}
<D>__{i might be able to accommodate you. is there some more luggage?}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{i'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{that's even better.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{but, gentlemen, i am afraid...}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{he's always afraid.}
<A>__{the other two exchange a look of agreement again.}
<C>__{manager}
<P>__{(a little annoyed)}
<D>__{i just wanted to explain. the apartment may suit your convenience but i doubt that it will fit your convictions. it's the royal suite.}
<A>__{the mention of the royal suite startles the three.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{royal suite!}
<P>__{(to the manager)}
<D>__{just a minute.}
<A>__{the three russians take a step away from the manager and go into a huddle.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<P>__{(in a low voice)}
<D>__{now comrades, i warn you... if it gets out in moscow that we stay in the royal suite we will get into terrible trouble.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<P>__{(defending his right to a good time)}
<D>__{we'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. that's a perfect excuse. there was no other safe big enough.}
<A>__{the other two welcome the suggestion with relish.}
<C>__{buljanoff and iranoff}
<D>__{that's right. good, very good.}
<A>__{suddenly buljanoff grows skeptical again.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{of course, we could take out the pieces and distribute them in three or four boxes in the vault and take a small room. that's an idea, isn't it?}
<A>__{for a moment all three see their bright plans crumble. then iranoff comes to the rescue.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{yes, it's an idea, but who says we have to have an idea?}
<A>__{buljanoff and kopalski see the logic of this and their faces light up.}
<C>__{both}
<D>__{that's right... that's right.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<P>__{(turning to the manager)}
<D>__{give us the royal suite.}
<A>__{the manager leads the three toward the elevator. the camera follows them and narrows down to the suitcase carried by two of the russians.}

<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{you are bringing in wrong values. love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. a lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.}

<D>__{don't do it, please.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i'm at a loss, ninotchka. you must forgive me if i appear a little old fashioned. after all, i'm just a poor bourgeois.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{it's never too late to change. i used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. my father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but i preferred the bayonet.}
<C>__{leon}

<D>__{the bayonet? did you really?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i was wounded before warsaw.}

<D>__{what kind of a girl are you, anyway?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{just what you see. a tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{you're the most adorable cog i ever saw in my life. ninotchka, cogitska, let me confess something. never did i dream i could feel like this toward a sergeant.}
<A>__{a clock strikes.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{do you hear that?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{it's twelve o'clock.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{it's midnight. one half of paris is making love to the other half. look at the clock. one hand has met the other hand. they kiss. isn't that wonderful?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{that's the way a clock works. there's nothing wonderful about it. you merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i can't possibly think of a better reason.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{it's false sentimentality.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(trying desperately}
<D>__{to make her mood}
<P>__{more romantic)}
<D>__{you analyze everything out of existence. you analyze me out of existence. i won't let you. love is not so simple. ninotchka, ninotchka, why do doves bill and coo? why do snails, coldest of all creatures, circle interminably around each other? why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates? why do flowers open their petals? oh, ninotchka, ninotchka, surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion... a general warmth in the palms of your hands... a strange heaviness in your limbs... a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing, more exalting, than thirst?}
<A>__{he pauses, waiting for the results of his speech.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{you are very talkative.}
<A>__{that is too much for leon. he takes her into his arms and kisses her.}

<D>__{have you?}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{decidedly. yesterday i was greatly amazed when i came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{and gaston, i was happier all day long. i felt i'd contributed something.}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{well, sir, if you should do it again, which i hope you won't, please remember the order. counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{may i add, sir, that it was with great amazement that i found a copy of karl marx's capital on your night table. that is a socialistic volume which i refuse to so much as dust, sir. i view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this bolshevik lady.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i can't follow you, gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? you being my servant? wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?}

<P>__{(outraged)}
<D>__{emphatically not, sir. the prospect terrifies me. now, don't misunderstand me, sir, i don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that i should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.}

<D>__{i wouldn't know. the closest i ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. the wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.}

<D>__{it's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.}
<A>__{by now the waiter is filling their glasses. ninotchka lifts her glass and looks at it.}

<P>__{(cynically)}
<D>__{it must be charming. i'm glad conditions are so improved. i assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{exactly. you see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low cut gowns in the old russia. the lashes of the cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{you're absolutely right about the cossacks. we made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts. they had such reliable guns.}

<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{no, darling. i will tell you another story, a much better one.}
<P>__{(with deep sincerity)}
<D>__{the only thing that will be over on thursday is the lawsuit. there will be no thursday for us. not next week or any week. we won't let it happen. i will tear it out of the calendar. is that a good story?}
