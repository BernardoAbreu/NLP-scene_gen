<A>__{again we return to the opening scene...floating down a long hallway. a window at the end of the hall enlarges as we approach. someone is standing in front of it. the murky silhouette of the figure turns and walks away. we follow it, tentative. turning a corner, we see the figure. standing in a doorway. now we can make out the edges of the figure. it is an old woman. hair in a victorian bun. a corseted dress.}
