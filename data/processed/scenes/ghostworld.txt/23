<L>__{interior art class day}
<A>__{the lights go on, the video ends and the monitor is shut off. there are about a dozen students, mostly pimply 14 year old boys, a few 14 ish girls, and enid, dressed in schoolgirl outfit. the teacher, roberta allsworth, addresses the class.}

<D>__{that piece is entitled "mirror father mirror." i like to show it to people i'm meeting for the first time because it says so much about who i am and what it feels like to inhabit my specific skin. and this is exactly what i'm hoping to get from each of you over the course of this summer: a picture of your own self exploration. my own background is in video and performance art, but i'm hoping that doesn't influence you and that you'll find your own ways of externalizing the internal. at the end of the summer, this class has been invited, along with several others in the area, to participate in a show of high school art at the neighborhood activity center. the title of the show will be "brotherhood and community: art as dialogue." i think the "brotherhood" theme ties in nicely with the theme of self discovery that i'd like to emphasize in this class. are there any questions so far?}
