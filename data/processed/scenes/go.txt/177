<A>__{claire kisses gaines, pinning him against the wall. rain beats against the door. she fumbles with his belt. his hand slides under her jacket, trying to undo her bra. they take a break from undressing to kiss harder. reclining on the steps, claire tries to push his jeans down with her toes. her foot gets caught in the chain from his wallet. her butt slides down a step. they laugh. her hand hits something hard his gun. it's tucked into his jacket pocket. as they start to work up a rhythm, huxley the cat comes down the steps, curious. he brushes against them, unnoticed. finally, he mews.}

<A>__{he looks to the top of the stairs, where a man is watching them. it's victor. he has the silver .45 drawn on them. gaines looks down to the door at the bottom. vic jr. is blocking it. they're trapped. claire looks around, trying to figure out what's happening.}
