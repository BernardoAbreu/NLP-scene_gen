<L>__{exterior beach night}
<A>__{rimmed by a dozen car headlights at the edge of the sand. utah crouches, waiting for the snap from nathaniel, ponytailed and powerfully built. facing them on defense are bodhi, tyler and three others: roach, gonzo and spiked haired. grommet... 17 and thin as a stick, and rosie, a biker with piggy eyes and arms blue with tattoos. montage style utah tosses a flurry of mindboggling passes. every one picture perfect. nathaniel scrambles z out left, turns and the ball is practically waiting for him. touchdowns galore. endzone dancing. bodhi stares at him curiously. tyler rushes. utah enjoys scrambling, ducking left and right, twisting her into a pretzel. play after play. utah tosses another touchdown, but tyler keeps coming. sacking him. they lie together in a heap, laughing. bodhi quarterbacks. utah rushes. bodhi fakes a pass then runs, ball tucked in his arm. utah tears after him. flat out speed run. roach attempts a block. utah hits him like a freight train. roach hits the sand face first. grommet and rosie the biker in a squeeze play. utah, fierce now, blasts between them. no mercy. utah can't play for fun. we see his expression. something scary there. what we will call "juggernaut mode". tyler just steps aside. bodhi running along wet sand as a wave sweeps up the beach. looks back. sees a demon shooting up roostertails of spray behind him, gaining. pours it on. both of them pistoning through curtains of water. not a game anymore. closing on the endzone. 5 yards. utah is airborne. slams bodhi like a sam missile. they crash and burn together in the surf. the other surfers run up. who's this newcomer that just centerpunched their main man? industrial strength tension.}
