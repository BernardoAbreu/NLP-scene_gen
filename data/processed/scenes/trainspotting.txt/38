<D>__{yeah, the guy's a psycho, but it's true, he's a mate as well, so what can you do? just stand back and watch and try not to get involved. begbie didn't do drugs either, he just did people. that what he got off on: his own sensory addiction.}
<A>__{the glass falls into the crowd. screaming starts. a woman is bleeding from a wound in her head. the men beside her turn furiously around to look for the source of the glass. up on the balcony, begbie stands up. the screams and shouting continue below. begbie appears at the bottom of the staircase down from the balcony. he strides towards the bleeding woman and begins shouting.}

<D>__{all right. nobody move. the girl got glassed and no cunt leaves here until we find out which cunt did it.}
<A>__{a man stands up from one of the tables.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{and who the fuck do you think you are?}
<A>__{begbie kick the man in the groin. another moves towards him but is blocked by the men surrounding the girl. soon the whole mass dissolves into a brutal scrum, in which begbie plays a prominent part. up on the balcony, the rest of the gang watch in silence.}
