<B>__{pad and paper}
<A>__{as they're placed in front of hallenbeck. he is seated on the bed. three guns covering him. beside him sits furry tom, grinning his stuffed toy grin.}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{are you a literate man, joe?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{i got a subscription to jugs magazine.}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{that's good. see, joe, what you're gonna do, you're gonna write a little story.}
<A>__{a goon sticks his head in the door.}
<C>__{goon}
<D>__{we've got jimmy dix in the trunk.}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{get him out of here. take him to mr. marcon. i will follow you as soon as my business here is finished.}
<A>__{the goon departs, leaving hallenbeck with pablo and two others. he studies them. calculates the odds. verdict: bad.}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{yeah, you're gonna write a little story, joe. about how guilt stricken you are over senator baynard's death, which is all over the air waves, by the way. yeah... you're so guilty about paying those hitmen to kill him, that you're gonna kill yourself.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{hey, who's writing this story? you're doing all the good parts.}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{oh, and, joe...? don't forget to include how guilty you are over that cop you murdered.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{what cop?}
<A>__{pablo draws his pistol. pumps two shots into the unconscious cop in the corner.}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{that one.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{you son of a bitch...!}
<A>__{pablo is making a big mistake, but he doesn't know it. he is fueling joe hallenbeck's rage. pity the fool. hallenbeck regards him with dead, lifeless eyes. a thoroughly unnerving stare. then joe does something very odd. he says, softly:}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{we don't like pablo very much, do we, furry tom...?}
<A>__{there is a pause... and then, incredibly furry tom answers. a high pitched, squeaky stuffed cat voice.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<P>__{(as furry tom)}
<D>__{no, mr. hallenbeck, we think pablo is a motherless fuck who takes it up the ass.}
<A>__{dead silence. pablo is completely thrown; so are we, for that matter... and then it hits us: joe is doing ven triloquism. and the funny thing is, he's really good. pablo overcomes his shock.}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{shit, is he doing that?}
<A>__{hallenbeck's face remains cold. expressionless.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{furry tom, tell pablo what i'm gonna do to him.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<P>__{(as furry tom)}
<D>__{you're gong to make pablo eat all his teeth, mr. hallenbeck.}
<A>__{pablo can't help it. he bursts out laughing.}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{that's amazing, man!}
<A>__{hallenbeck picks up furry tom. inserts his hand, makes the furry head bob back and forth.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<P>__{(as furry tom)}
<D>__{hey, mr. hallenbeck, they're laughin' at me. that's not very nice.}
<A>__{by now, all three hoods are in hysterics.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{are you mad, furry tom?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<P>__{(as furry tom)}
<D>__{i don't get mad. i get even.}
<A>__{and, with that, furry tom's mouth opens and explodes, showering stuffing. one of the goons is still laughing when he realizes half his throat is gone... and furry thomas belches fire again, and the second goon goes down in a spray of blood, and if you haven't guessed already joe has a gun hidden inside furry thomas. pablo is a little sharper. a little quicker. he dives forward, knocks the puppet from joe's hand. joe drives upward, into pablo's gut. they reel across the room. locked in combat. lamps topple. glass breaks. pablo slams joe's head into the wall. leaves a dent. does it again, a sickening impact... starts to strangle joe and the truth is, joe's not thirty anymore. he's not going to make it. the world swims away. then, as if through a tunnel, joe notices something beside him... something hanging on the wall. fights to focus. breath gone. strength gone. identifies the object: his presidential medal of valor. shiny medal. shiny ribbon. his name... it hits him quite suddenly: the medal has sharp edges. with the last of his strength, he plucks it from the wall. drives it into pablo's throat. the big man stumbles backward. eyes wide. gurgling. he thrashes, the red white blue ribbon flapping obscenely from his gushing neck. drops to the dusty carpet. dies. hallenbeck takes a deep breath. eyes wide. insane. he is surrounded by corpses. he takes another deep breath. picks up the sniper rifle. slings it over his shoulder. heads for the door.}
