<L>__{exterior alley curran theater night}
<A>__{karen moves toward the stage door. she passes a recess in the wall perhaps an exit about halfway.}
<C>__{eve's voice}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{mrs. richards...}
<A>__{karen hesitates, looks. eve is barely distinguishable in the shadow of the recess. karen smiles, waits. eve comes out. a gooseneck light above them reveals her... she wears a cheap trench coat, low heeled shoes, a rain hat stuck on the back of her head... her large, luminous eyes seem to glow up at karen in the strange half light.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{so there you are. it seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{why should you think i wouldn't be?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{why should you be? after all, six nights a week for weeks of watching even margo channing enter and leave a theater }
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i hope you don't mind my speaking to you...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{not at all.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i've seen you so often it took every bit of courage i could raise }
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{to speak to just a playwright's wife? i'm the lowest form of celebrity...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{you're margo channing's best friend. you and your husband are always with her and mr. sampson... what's he like?}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{bill sampson? he's he's a director.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{he's the best.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{he'll agree with you. tell me, what do you between the time margo goes in and comes out? just huddle in that doorway and wait?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{oh, no. i see the play.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{you see the play? you've seen the play every performance?}
<P>__{(eve nods)}
<D>__{but, don't you find it i mean apart from everything else don't you find it expensive?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{standing room doesn't cost much. i manage.}
<A>__{karen contemplates eve. then she takes her arm.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm going to take you to margo...}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(hanging back)}
<D>__{oh, no...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{she's got to meet you }
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{no, i'd be imposing on her, i'd be just another tongue tied gushing fan...}
<A>__{karen practically propels her toward the stage door.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(insisting)}
<D>__{there isn't another like you, there couldn't be }
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{but if i'd known... maybe some other time... i mean, looking like this.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you look just fine...}
<P>__{(they're at the stage door)}
<D>__{... by the way. what's your name?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{eve. eve harrington.}
<A>__{karen opens the door. they go in.}
