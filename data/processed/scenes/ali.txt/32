<A>__{(miami) nothing. cassius is asleep in a lounge chair...incongruously a tv is run from the house by an extension cord. cassius wakes. his eyes say, "who are you?"}
<C>__{bundini}
<P>__{(entering)}
<D>__{i'm called bundini, rhymes with houdini. he was a jew, too...some other people call me fastblack...or daddy mac...}
<A>__{drew "bundini" brown, early forties, holds a hat in his hand, his eyes always seem to be glistening, ready to rage, laugh or cry, tentatively approaches. cassius' flat eyes return to the television.}
<C>__{bundini }
<P>__{(motions at lounge chair)}
<D>__{shorty sent me to sugar ray robinson. i gave my power to sugar ray for seven years, gave him my voodoo, my magic. now shorty sent me to you.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{who shorty?}
<C>__{bundini}
<D>__{i call him shorty 'cause he like 'em circumcised. original people. like moses. and i was a babe in a basket, too. i was born on a doorstep with a note 'cross my chest that read, "do the best you can for him, world." i had to suck the first nipple come along. i didn't run away from home...i been runnin' to home.}
<A>__{cassius should kick him out, but bundini's got his foot in the door of cassius' attention.}
<C>__{bundini }
<P>__{(beat, and his raison d'etre)}
<D>__{now, i gotta ask you. you fixin' them fights? else no way you could tell great archie moore what round you droppin' him in...all of them predictions you make, comin' true. never heard of nobody predictin' the round like you. you either a phony or shorty's in your corner. tell me the truth, young man...}
<A>__{cassius, stretched out, mumbles without looking at him...}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{...i study every fight. 'til i got a plan. wear him down two through four. drop him in the fifth round. so the p'diction ain't a p'diction. it's a plan. and 'cause of all the poppin' off i do, i know i gotta win! that's the truth. and why i'm tellin' you?}
<C>__{bundini}
<D>__{'cause i'm gonna be your inspiration. your motivator. in your corner. can i be in your corner, young man?}
<C>__{cassius}
<P>__{(thinks, then)}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{bundini}
