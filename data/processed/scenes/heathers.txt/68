<L>__{interior fast food restaurant night}
<A>__{now in heavy metal gear, heather duke slams down the petition atop a booth of metalheads.}
<L>__{interior the smoke filled hallway day}
<A>__{decked out in denim, heather duke vanishes into the stoner hallway smoke, with the petition.}
<B>__{the staircase window}
<A>__{heather duke further writhes in the sunlight until veronica's perplexed voice cuts into her bliss.}
<C>__{veronica }
<D>__{heather?}
<A>__{heather duke brings down her arms and the petition and turns to veronica, revealed to be descending down the steps.}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{veronica! color me stoked, girl. i've gotten everyone to sign this petition even the one who think bigfun are tuneless eurofags. people love me!}
<P>__{(giggling)}
<D>__{my god, you haven't signed!}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{people love you but i know you. jennifer forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. and doug hylton...}
<C>__{heather duke}
<P>__{(verbally winking)}
<D>__{so some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....}
<P>__{(happiness evaporating)}
<D>__{hey, just sign the petition!}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{don't talk to me like that.}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{it was j.d.'s idea! he made out the signature sheet and everything. now will you sign it?}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(queasy)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{jealous much?}
<A>__{veronica slaps heather duke with all her might.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{heather, why can't you just be a friend? why are you such a megabitch?}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{because i can be! the same fucking cheek, goddamnit! why are you pulling my dick? do you think, do you really think, if betty finn's fairy godmother made her cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? no way! uh uh!}
<A>__{heather duke stumbles down the stairs. j.d.'s voice cuts into veronica's concentration.}
<C>__{j.d. }
<D>__{wanna go out tonight?}
<A>__{veronica grimly turns to see a smirking, descending j.d.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{catch a movie? miniature golf?}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(jokingly but caustically)}
<D>__{i was thinking more along the lines of slitting heather duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{i could be up for that. i've already started underlining meaningful passages in heather's copy of catcher in the rye, if you know what i mean. so are we on?}
<A>__{veronica somberly steps forward to j.d., grabs his elbows, then pulls him gently, seemingly for a kiss. she spits in his face and bolts down the stairs, calling up to him.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{it's over, j.d. over!}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{i don't get it! you were wrong! i was right! strength, damnit! come back!}
