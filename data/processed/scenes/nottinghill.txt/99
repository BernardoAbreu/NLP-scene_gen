<A>__{from outside we see this scrawny bloke in the frame of the doorway, in his grey underpants. a thousand photos. spike poses athletically.}
<L>__{interior william's corridor day}
<A>__{spike closes the door and wanders along to a mirror in the hall way, muttering.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{how did i look?}
<A>__{inspects himself.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{not bad. no bad at all. well chosen briefs, i'd say. chicks love grey. mmmmm. nice firm buttocks.}
<L>__{interior william's bedroom day}
<A>__{william enters. he's unhappy for her. she's almost dressed.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{how are you doing?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{how do you think i'm doing?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i don't know what happened.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i do. your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where i was.}
<A>__{she's packing.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{that's not true.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{really? the entire british press just woke up this morning and thought 'hey i know where anna scott is. she's in that house with the blue door in notting hill.' and then you go out in your goddamn underwear.}
<C>__{spike}
<P>__{(dropping in)}
<D>__{i went out in my goddamn underwear too.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{get out, spike.}
<P>__{(he does)}
<D>__{i'm so sorry.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{this is such a mess. i come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now i'm landed in it all over again. for god's sake, i've got a boyfriend.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{you do?}
<A>__{it's a difficult moment defining where they stand.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{as far as they're concerned i do. and now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to timbuktu.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i know, i know but... just let's stay calm...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you can stay calm it's the perfect situation for you minimum input, maximum publicity. everyone you ever bump into will know. 'well done you you slept with that actress we've seen the pictures.'}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{that's spectacularly unfair.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{who knows, it may even help business. buy a boring book about egypt from the guy who screwed anna scott.}
<A>__{she heads out.}
