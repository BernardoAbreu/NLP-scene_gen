<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior historical society room night (brightly lit)}
<A>__{angle on the door, from inside, its lettering reversed on the frosted glass. the bach is very loud. after a moment the door is shouldered open, hard enough for the glass to shatter, tate following his gun inside, moving low, then other cops appearing behind him in the doorframe. they all freeze, staring in utter horror.}
<C>__{sgt. tate}
<D>__{oh no... no...}
<B>__{their pov}
<A>__{is a brief snapshot from hell. the two uniformed bodies, one sprawled on its back near the door, the other still in the cell, have been savaged by a knife. blood and gore everywhere. the faces are unrecognizable.}
<B>__{sgt. tate}
<A>__{struggles for control, as the other cops move grimly around him, into the room. he pulls his walkie talkie from his belt.}
<C>__{sgt. tate}
<P>__{(into mike)}
<D>__{command post... two offi }
<P>__{(a beat; clears his throat)}
<D>__{two officers down. prisoner is missing. repeat, lecter is missing... he's stripped the bed, might be making a rope, check all windows. where the fuck is my ambulance?}
<B>__{in the cell}
<A>__{a cop angrily punches off the music. jacobs kneels with his fingers on boyle's neck.}
<C>__{jacobs}
<D>__{boyle is dead, sarge. his gun's gone...}
<B>__{at the other body}
<A>__{a cop gently removes a revolver from the bloody fist. murray, the young patrolman, brings his ear reluctantly close to the gory face. a bloody bubble appears there; the wreckage groans, very softly.}
<C>__{murray}
<D>__{this one's alive!}
<A>__{tate crosses, kneels to see for himself. murray looks green.}
<C>__{sgt. tate}
<D>__{take ahold of him where he can feel your hands, son. talk to him.}
<C>__{murray}
<D>__{what's his name, sarge?}
<C>__{sgt. tate}
<D>__{it's pembry, now talk to him, god dammit.}
<P>__{(into radio, looking around)}
<D>__{boyle's dead, pembry's read bad. lecter is missing and armed he took boyle's gun...}
<A>__{the other cop, checking the cylinder of pembry's gun, holds up one finger to tate.}
<C>__{sgt. tate}
<P>__{(into radio)}
<D>__{pembry got off one round there's a chance lecter was hit. we heard a total of three shots fired, so he's got four left... he's got a knife, too.}
