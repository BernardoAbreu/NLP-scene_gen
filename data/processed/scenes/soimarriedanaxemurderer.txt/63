<L>__{interior charlie's bedroom middle of the night}
<A>__{charlie lies in bed. he's writing in his journal. he stares out into space. inspired, he writes...}
<B>__{angle on the journal}
<A>__{don't be disillusioned by the scottish son as he flies, in bat like unison}
<B>__{charlie}
<A>__{pauses a moment to reflect, then writes...}
<B>__{angle on the journal}
<A>__{untrust ing unknow ing unlov ing}
<B>__{charlie}
<A>__{thinks of something else and writes...}
<B>__{angle on the journal this poem sucks}
<A>__{his hand reaches across and scratches it out.}
