<L>__{interior convent laundry room day}
<A>__{this is a basement utility room. a large industrial washer dryer stands along one wall; the machine makes a repetitive chung chung sound the choir nuns are busily doing laundry; some iron, others fold sheets, others stack towels and garments on a long table. christy is helping mary patrick fold a sheet. everyone is working rhythmically, to the drone of the washer dryer.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{that machine.}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{i know. it's ancient.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{it's a rhythm section. the beat.}
<A>__{christy starts clapping her hands to the sound of the washer dryer; gradually, the other nuns join her.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{mary patrick do you remember the dixie cups?}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{the dixie cups? oh my. i was just a girl. of course.}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{spring is here the sun will shine}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(stopping the beat)}
<D>__{hold it. mary patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{am i?}
<A>__{there is a murmur from all the other nuns "oh, yes.}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<P>__{(as a confession)}
<D>__{all right, i am, i know it! all my life, i've just been... upbeat. optimistic. perky. i can't help it. even when i was little, i remember my mother used to say, "that child is pure sunshine. she'll either be a nun or a stewardess."}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{so use it. when we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? celebration. most music is. so don't hold back. let all that joy go right into your voice. make me happy. let me hear it. perk out. perk down.}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<P>__{(with real joy)}
<D>__{spring is here the sun will shine i will be his and he'll be mine we'll love until the end of time and we'll never be lonely anymore}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{because we're}
<C>__{all the nuns}
<D>__{going to the chapel and we're gonna get married going to the chapel and we're gonna get married going to the chapel and we're gonna get married}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{going to the chapel of love!}
<A>__{the nuns have really gotten into the song, with christy encouraging them verbally. they are sounding better and better. sister mary frederick, a member of the choir, steps into the laundry room and lets loose with a sudden, piercing whistle. the nuns immediately stop singing, and a moment later mother superior enters. the room is quiet except for the sound of the washer dryer. the nuns all get very busy at their laundry tasks.}
<C>__{nuns}
<P>__{(in unison)}
<D>__{good morning, reverend mother.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{good morning, sisters.}
<A>__{mother superior takes one more glance around, then leaves. now that the coast is clear, the singing begins again, quietly, to the rhythm of the machine.}
<C>__{nuns}
<D>__{going to the chapel...}
