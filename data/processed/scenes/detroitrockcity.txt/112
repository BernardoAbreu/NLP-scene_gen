<C>__{surly mom}
<D>__{just wait until your father gets ahold of you!}
<A>__{jam, hawk, lex, and trip turn and look at the crumpled wad at their feet. it's an envelope. an angelic spotlight from above highlights it.}

<D>__{no... you don't think...?}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{nah. couldn't be.}
<A>__{they all shake their heads in unison resolved that it isn't. then, unable to control themselves, they dive for the envelope. jam tears it open. his trembling hand reaches in. all their eyes focus like lasers on what's inside. jam pulls out four kiss tickets. their jaws drop. their eyes bug.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{it's a miracle! a miracle!}
<A>__{the boys are practically moved to tears. it's divine intervention at its finest. suddenly, a greasy hand juts out of nowhere and grabs the tickets. the boys look up shocked. they can't believe it.}

<D>__{boys, this time... i win!}
<A>__{elvis stuffs all four tickets in his mouth and chews crazily. in seconds, gulp. elvis explodes into unhinged laughter as he runs away zigzagged down the street. our boys are left dumbstruck and speechless. after a really long pause...}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{well... i still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.}
<C>__{hawk}
<P>__{(beaten)}
<D>__{go ahead, jam.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{we all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. they gotta let us in then.}
<A>__{they stand and think for a moment. hawk's mouth curls into a devilish grin. then, he lets out a gigantic "aieee!!! and slugs jam. the four boys brutally pummel one another in the middle of the intersection. punching. kicking. headbutting.}
