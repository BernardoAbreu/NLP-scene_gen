<L>__{interior ben's dollar store day}
<A>__{frank and karl make their way through the fairly crowded store. it's sort of a mini version of a walmart. they find frank's mother in her red smock talking to a guy in a red ben's knit shirt. they are laughing together and pricing some mouthwash. linda wheatley is a short, plain woman in her thirties. the man, vaughan cunningham, is in his forties, with a neat flattop hair cut, glasses, and a paunch hanging over his belt. they eye karl suspiciously, as the boys approach.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{hey, mama. hey, vaughan.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{hey, sweetheart. what you up to?}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{let me guess. you want a bunch of candy and a pop.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{you're gonna rot your teeth that way. but i bet i know what you would like even better. i put potted meat on special, four cans for a dollar and they're not moving very well. i'd sure let a few cans go for free to the right boy.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i don't like potted meat. daddy used to say it was made out of lips and peckers and intestints.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{frank, don't talk that way. who's that strange lookin' man behind you? did he follow you in here?}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{can i help you, sir?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{oh, that's karl. i met him at the laundrymat. karl, this is my mama. and vaughan, vaughan's the manager. he lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{nice to meet you, karl.}
<C>__{karl}
<P>__{(keeping his distance)}
<D>__{pleased to know y'all.}
<A>__{there's an uncomfortable silence.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{frank come back here with me for a minute.}
<A>__{she shuffles him away and leaves vaughan staring at karl.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{i don't think i've ever seen you before.}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{naw, i don't believe you have. i don't reckon i never been in here. this store didn't used to be here.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{it's been here seventeen years. did you live here before or something?}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{i's horned and raised here up till i's twelve year old.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{what brings you back?}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{what's that you say?}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{why are you here now?}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{they turned me loose from the state hospital.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{is that right?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{are you going to be staying here long?}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{i reckon mr. woolridge got me hired on to work for bill cox's outfit.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{do you have family here?}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{not really to speak of.}
<A>__{linda and frank return from the back.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{hey karl, guess what. mama said you can stay with us. out in the garage. our car won't fit in there anyway. it's real neat.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{frank told me about your situation. and frank loves company. you know, especially after his daddy passed and all. there ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.}
<P>__{(to vaughan, hushed)}
<D>__{he's mentally retarded, poor thing.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<P>__{(hushed)}
<D>__{he just got out of the state hospital.}
<C>__{linda}
<P>__{(put out)}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{can we get some candy and pops?}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{sure, go ahead.}
<A>__{they walk off down the aisle leaving vaughan a little puzzled.}
<C>__{vaughan }
<D>__{are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{frank's just crazy about him. he likes the way he talks. he helped him carry home the clean laundry.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{he's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{he's retarded's all. you know he's always after a father figure and lord knows doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{what about me?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i don't think he sees you as a guy guy.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<P>__{(wrinkles his brow)}
<D>__{karl is a guy guy?}
