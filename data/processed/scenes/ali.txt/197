<L>__{exterior kinshasa shantytown kids dusk into night}
<A>__{and old people, teenagers in dirty t shirts with strange hats. their eyes are wide. reverse: ali shows his bare hands. now he rubs them together and magically pulls from his closed fist a colored scarf. the kids scream.}
<B>__{veronica}
<A>__{squints, trying to figure out how he did it, because...}
<B>__{ali}
<A>__{shows the scarf, pushes back his cuffs so that he can't hide anything up his sleeves. his wrists are bare. he shows both sides. now, he takes the scarf and pushes with his right hand and feeds it into the closed fist of his left. he looks up wide eyed at everybody. then, he opens his fingers and the scarf is not there! ali + veronica walk, towering over the kids. one girl holds ali's hand. the others maintain a respectful proximity so that they don't invade the space around ali.}

<D>__{...green eyes and cocoa skin...?}
<P>__{(feigns wobbly legs)}
<D>__{...okay, rest of me, let's go!!}
<A>__{veronica laughs. she brings his hand up to her mouth and kisses it. hand in hand, a towering man and a towering woman walk away at their ease against the soft sky with their entourage of teenagers and kids. on the perimeter, a kid does flips and, then, gets distracted...}
