<L>__{interior turkish baths. steam room day}
<D>__{nikolai is sweating hard, staring at the ceiling. the steam room door opens but the steam is now so thick he can't see who has entered.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{ozim? he sees a shape... a clothed body. he realizes immediately. suddenly one of the brothers is upon him and has him in a head lock. he strokes the tattoo on nikolai's chest as if this were confirmation of who this is. he grunts an instruction and his brother emerges through the steam with an open razor. nikolai is naked, alone. suddenly he kicks the razor guy in the balls and uses a martial arts chop to free himself from the other brother. in the steam there are boots and bare feet and knees and fingers flying. nikolai manages to gouge the eye of one brother and throw another against the wall. he obviously has serious combat training but the brothers are strong and angry. suddenly nikolai is slashed across the arm by the razor and blood oozes into the steam and hot water. all the men are slipping and falling on the blood and hot water. another slash of the razor cuts his thigh open. all the men are now covered in blood and nikolai, with a final surge of strength, manages to cripple one brother with a blow to the throat, and the other with an elbow to the temple. as the chechens slump to the floor, nikolai fumbles in the bloody water for the razor, finds it, kneels, and slashes their throats. he lurches to his feet, drops the razor, and staggers out of the steam room.}
