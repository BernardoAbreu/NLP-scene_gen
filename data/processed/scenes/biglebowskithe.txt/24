<B>__{jackie treehorn presents}
<T>__{another title card:}
<B>__{the dude and maude lebowski in}
<T>__{third title card:}
<B>__{gutterballs}
<A>__{the title logo is a suggestively upright bowling pin flanked by a pair of bowling balls. the bending bass sound turns into the lead in to kenny rogers and the first edition's "just dropped in." the dude is walking down a long corridor dressed as a cable repairman. the dude's face is washed with a brilliant light as the corridor opens onto a gleaming bowling alley. in the center of the alley stands maude lebowski, singing operatic harmony to the kenny rogers song. she wears an armored breastplate and norse headgear, has braided pigtails, and holds a trident. the dude stands behind her and, pressed up against her, helps her with her follow through as she releases a bowling ball. the lane is straddled by a line of chorines in spangly mini skirts, their arms akimbo, busby berkley style, their legs turning the lane into a tunnel leading to the pins at the end. but it is no longer a bowling ball rolling between their legs it is the dude himself, levitating inches off the lane, the tools from his utility belt swinging free. he is face down, his arms, torpedolike, pressed against his sides. his point of view shows the lane rushing by below, the little ball guide arrows zipping by. the dude twists his body around, performing a barrel roll so that he is now gliding along the lane face up. now his point of view looks up the dresses of the passing chorines. the dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so that he is once again gliding face down. he looks forward and his forward momentum blows back his hair. coming at us, as we go through the last few pairs of legs, are the approaching pins. we hit the pins, scattering them, and rush on into black. a body drops down into the blackness in slow motion a topless woman, squealing, her legs kicking. as she drops out of frame, leaving blackness again, three men are entering from the background, emerging into a pool of light. it is the germans, advancing ominously, wielding oversized shears which they menacingly scissor. the dude, now standing in a field of black, reacts to the advancing germans. he turns and runs, fists pumping. the scissoring sound of the shears turns into the whoosh of car bys. the field of black is punctured by headlights. the dude is running blearily down the middle of the pacific coast highway. cars rush by on either side, horns blaring. with the bloo whup of a short siren blast, a squad car with flashing gumballs pulls up.}
<B>__{squad car}
<A>__{the dude sits in the back seat, his head lolling with the motion of the car as he blearily sings the theme of branded:}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{he was innocent. not a charge was true. and they say he ran awaaaaaay.}
<A>__{chief's office the dude is hurled against the chief's desk, which he bounces off of, to come to rest more or less seated in a facing chair. his wallet is tossed onto the desk. the chief leans forward, takes the wallet and sorts through it with disgusted incredulity.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{this is your only i.d.?}
<A>__{he is looking at the ralph's shopper's club card.}

<C>__{dude}
<D>__{that guy treats women like objects, man.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{mr. treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, lebowski. you don't draw shit. we got a nice quiet beach community here, and i aim to keep it nice and quiet. so let me make something plain. i don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, lebowski. i don't like your jerk off name, i don't like your jerk off face, i don't like your jerk off behavior, and i don't like you, jerk off do i make myself clear?}
<A>__{the dude stares.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i wasn't listening.}
<A>__{the chief hurls his steaming mug of coffee at the dude. it hits him in the forehead with a thud, the scalding coffee splashing everywhere. the chief is already up off his chair, rounding the desk.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{ ow! fucking fascist!}
<A>__{the chief slaps him twice.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{stay out of malibu, lebowski!}

<B>__{cab}
<A>__{the dude, in the back seat of a taxicab that rocks and squeaks with every bump, is gingerly touching at sore spots on his face and scalp. "peaceful easy feeling" is on the radio. dude's pov the back of the driver, a large black man with rasta dreds under a knit cap.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{jesus, man, can you change the station?}

<B>__{the street}
<A>__{the cab screeches over towards the curb. another car, oncoming, its radio blaring metallica, speeds by.}
<B>__{inside the other car}
<A>__{it is a red convertible. the driver, singing loudly and badly along with the radio, her hair blowing in the wind, a dreamy smile on her face as she speeds along, higher than a kite, is bunny lebowski.}
