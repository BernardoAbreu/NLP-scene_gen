<L>__{exterior yankee stadium day}
<A>__{vaughn is on the mound warming up.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{so, ricky vaughn, roughed up in his only other appearance against the yankees, will see what he can do with the bronx bombers this time. vaughn, after a slow start, has come on lately and now leads the american league in strikeouts with 221.}
<A>__{vaughn finishes his warmups. as taylor pumps the ball down to second, vaughn hears a voice from the yankee dug out.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{hey, jailbird!}
<A>__{vaughn glances over and sees that one of the yankees is dressed in a striped prison uniform. he also wears long earrings, high heels, and of course, glasses. vaughn tries to ignore the guy, but his concentration is broken. vaughn steps up on the rubber for his first pitch. he winds and fires. the yankee leadoff hitter rips a one hopper to the wall in right center. hayes runs it down and guns it back to the infield to hold the guy to a double. the convict whoops it up. vaughn gets back up on the rubber. as he comes to the stretch, he catches sight of the convict again. the guy is doing a pantomime, sneaking up to a car and picking the lock, much to the delight of his teammates. vaughn throws his pitch in the dirt and all the way to the backstop. the runner on second goes to third.}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(throwing the ball back)}
<D>__{c'mon, rick baby, settle down.}
<A>__{vaughn gets ready again. the convict finishes picking the lock and then is suddenly arrested. he puts his hands against the wall and spreads his legs for a weapons check, cracking up the whole bench. vaughn is getting a little steamed. his next pitch is hammered into left for a single, scoring a run.}
<B>__{three shots of vaughn}
<A>__{throwing pitches, followed by:}
<B>__{shots}
<A>__{of the third hitter lining a double down the right field line, the fourth hitter a triple off the center field wall, and the fifth hitter a single to right. the scoreboard now reads 4 to 0 yankees. taylor comes out to talk to vaughn.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{what's the problem, rick? you're throwin' basketballs up there. that guy in the dugout botherin' you?}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{naw, i'm all right.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{forget him. worry about the guys carryin' bats. c'mon, ricky, let's get nasty.}
<A>__{vaughn nods as taylor trots back behind the plate. vaughn gets set again as his old nemesis, haywood, steps into the batter's box. haywood has a sly smile on his face. as vaughn comes to his stretch, the convict goes back into his act. he's in jail now, struggling against the bars. finally he bends over and grabs his ankles, while one of his teammates humps up against him, pretending to bugger him. this sends the yankee bench into hysterics. vaughn has lost it now. he fires to the plate and haywood creams another tape measure job into the upper deck. hayes doesn't even bother to run back to the wall. he just watches it go. 6 0 yankees.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i thought now that vaughn had some control, he was ready for the yankees.}
<C>__{pepper}
<D>__{not quite yet.}
<A>__{brown makes his way to the mound to take vaughn out.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{so, vaughn pitches in some tough luck here as the yankees put together as few squib hits and take a 6 0 lead.}
<B>__{doyle}
<A>__{in the press box. the stadium below is empty, the grounds crew covering the infield.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{well, the indians made a gallant comeback today, but fell one run short as the yankees held on for a 6 5 victory, although they didn't do squat after the first inning. anyway, if the bus makes it here from the hotel we'll be on at 7:30 tomorrow night. till then, this is harry doyle, saying so long, everybody, and happy hunting.}
