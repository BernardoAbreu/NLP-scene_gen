<D>__{i can only take you to grand junction, but you'll have a better chance to get a ride from there.}
<A>__{the star man smiles.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{where you from?}
<A>__{the star man starts to point to the sky, then catches himself.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{parlez vous francais?... habla ingles?... sprechen zie deutsch?}
<A>__{these are foreign words to the star man and he pastes on his smile.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{good job, neither do i. what do you do for a living?}
<C>__{star man}
<P>__{(pretending)}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{i'm a cook. do you understand 'cook?'}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{cook }
<D>__{food. eat. i prepare food. i work as a cook. that's how i make money.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{what do you do?}
<C>__{star man}
<P>__{(searches for an answer, then)}

<C>__{cook}
<P>__{(takes a pack of camels out of his pocket)}
<D>__{you don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. i got a girl going to college this fall. the wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for it.}
<A>__{he sticks a cigarette in his mouth and flips one up for the}
<B>__{star man.}
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{smoke?}
<A>__{the star man takes it, quickly examines it, then positions it in his mouth at the exact angle the cook did. his eyebrows raise when the cook flicks his bic and puffs an ash on the end of his cigarette. the butane flame is swung in his direction and he flinches back before allowing the cook to singe his camel. he copies the cook's puffing and the end of his cigarette begins to glow.}
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{she wants to become a doctor. she's a bright kid. hard worker. i think she'll make it. but the damned inflation's driven the tuition up so high it makes it real tough on a family like ours.}
<A>__{the cook inhales deeply from his cigarette and blows smoke at the windshield. the star man mimics the inhalation, then chokes. his eyes bulge and his cheeks puff out as he tries to be cool and not cough. the cook takes no notice of his struggles.}
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{i got two other kids. i don't know what we'll do when they get old enough for college.}
<A>__{smoke starts to dribble out of the star man's nose and mouth. puzzled, he re examines his cigarette.}
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{everybody blames it on the oil crisis. that might be where it starts. but i think a lot of people are just using that as an excuse to rip the rest of us off. i see it every day in the kitchen. peaches. we use the gallon cans. the price has gone up three times in the last year. and now the cans are only half full.}
<A>__{the cook takes another drag. as if etiquette required it, the star man hurries to copy him. this time there are no ill effects.}
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{do you have children?}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{they're damned expensive and a pain in the ass sometimes, but i wouldn't trade having them for anything.}
<A>__{the cook flicks his ash out of the window. a moment later, the star man mirrors his action.}
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{what do you think of america?}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{it is beautiful.}
