<L>__{interior willy's apartment the next morning}
<A>__{the alarm clock shifts to 6:00 am and pops on to local news and traffic but the narrow futon bed is already empty. willy slocum works at a laptop on his second hand desk, lit by a solitary lamp. he is in his late 20s, good looking. short hair, office pale but athletic, wearing mis matched sweats from eastern oklahoma state college. he jots a final note, sets his yellow legal pad aside. as he goes to the closet sized bathroom, pulling off his sweatshirt and starting the tiny pre fab shower, we linger on the laptop screen: rental listings for a new apartment.}
<B>__{time cut}
<A>__{the bare overhead bulb is on, revealing the concrete floor and painted plywood walls. his clothes hang neatly on a length of pipe suspended by ropes from the exposed rafters. law school texts fill cinderblock and board shelves. the radio chatters. willy knots a tie in his crisp white collar.}
<B>__{time cut}
<A>__{willy methodically packs legal folders from last night's "homework" into his big, battered briefcase. he has to work to stuff all the files in. he pulls on his suit jacket, settles the shoulders, tugs at his cuffs. uncaps a pen, leans over a one sentence letter waiting on the desk. reads it over. as he signs, we glimpse:}
<D>__{ hereby give notice that i will be resigning my position at the district attorney's office as of novemb }
<A>__{willy savors the moment. then he tucks the letter into an envelope, gets the heavy briefcase goes to shut off the light and open the door which swings about six inches, then clonks into something. willy grimaces. peeks out, goes to pound on a wall.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{mrs. demello?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{mrs. demello! your car!}
<A>__{silence. he sighs. shuts the door and presses a button near the light switch. there's mechanical grinding noise as the far wall slowly rolls up, letting in daylight and revealing an alley beyond the hanging clothes and cinderblock shelves. he presses the garage door opener button again, and hurries across the apartment to duck out under the closing door.}
