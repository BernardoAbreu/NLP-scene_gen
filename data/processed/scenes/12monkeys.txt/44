<A>__{as cole blinks awake, the digitized monotone of the p.a. system continues to drone in an unearthly voice...}
<D>__{unearthly voice p.a. system they're the ones who are going to do it...}
<A>__{cole's eyes seek the source of the sound and find it on the table in front of the panel of disapproving scientists facing him. it's a beat up old tape recorder.}
<D>__{unearthly voice tape recorder i can't do anything more. the police are after me.}
<A>__{the tape ends, runs off the reel, flap...flap...flap...}
<C>__{astrophysicist}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{uh, what?}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{he's drugged out of his mind! he's completely zoned out.}
<C>__{astrophysicist}
<D>__{cole, did you or did you not record that message?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{uh, that message...me?}
<C>__{microbiologist}
<D>__{it's a digital reconstruction of a message, cole, from a weak signal on our contact number. did you make that call?}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{i couldn't call! you sent me to the wrong year! it was 1989.}
<C>__{scientists}
<D>__{1989!}
<A>__{the scientists react, exchanging looks, whispers. then,}
<C>__{zoologist}
<D>__{you're certain of that?}
<C>__{geologist}
<P>__{(before cole can answer)}
<D>__{what did you do with your time, cole? did you waste it on drugs? women?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{they forced me to take drugs.}
<C>__{botanist}
<D>__{forced you! why would someone force you to take drugs?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i got into trouble. i got arrested. but i still got you a specimen a spider but i didn't have anyplace to put it, so i ate it. it was the wrong year anyway, so i guess it doesn't matter.}
<A>__{the scientists stare incredulously, then turn, exchange knowing looks, huddle, start whispering to one another. struggling to stay awake cole sees, blurrily, the microbiologist staring at cole intently. for one moment, the face belongs to dr. fletcher! cole blinks hard...and the microbiologist has his own face, again. cole's head slumps forward now...and everything goes dark.}
<C>__{geologist's voice }
<D>__{cole!}
