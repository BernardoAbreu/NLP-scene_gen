<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{the early rays of dawn are faintly seen coming through a window at the far end of the corridor. claudia comes rushing out of her room and runs over to patrizia's door. she knocks, then without waiting for a response, she enters.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{patrizia... patrizia ... where's ettore?}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{i imagine he must be inside sleeping.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{would you please see if sandro is with him? he's not in his room. i'm sorry to disturb you.}
<A>__{patrizia gets up out of bed and goes into the adjoining room.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{ettore...}
<C>__{ettore}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{nothing, nothing at all. i was just looking for sandro.}
<C>__{ettore}
<D>__{and you expect to find him in here? go and ask claudia.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{yes, yes, of course.}
<A>__{she returns to her room.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{patrizia, i'm afraid.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{more or less, we are all afraid. especially at night.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i'm afraid that anna has come back. i feel she's back, and that they're together.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{but what's gotten into you?... we would have known. sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. it would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.}
<A>__{claudia sinks down into a chair, weak and exhausted.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{now, listen. for god's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. go to your room and get back into bed.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{just several days ago, the thought of anna being dead would have made me sick. and now, i don't even cry, i'm afraid she might be alive. everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{you should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{yes, you're right. i'm sick and tired of being like that.}
<A>__{claudia gets up and leaves the room. she continues walking down along the corridor, checking here and there. but the hotel is deserted. there are still a few lights on in the reception hall but not enough to illuminate the place adequately. finally, she reaches the main hall and stops. the only signs of last night's party is a certain disorder in the placement of the armchairs and ashtrays filled with cigarette butts. even the main hall seems completely deserted. but all of a sudden, claudia becomes aware of something moving on a sofa at the far end of the room. she takes a few steps, walking silently over the thick carpet, so as to get a better look. there seems to be a slight movement among what appears to be a jumbled pile of male and female clothes, partly hidden from view by the back of the sofa. claudia goes up still closer because she is not able to see clearly what or who it is. only that she has the impression of having seen that suit before... a man's suit. she is now able to distinguish what it is: a couple embracing and kissing. claudia approaches still closer. she is now just a few steps away. little by little, as she advances, her face takes on such a painful look of astonishment that she appears almost petrified. she hesitates and bumps up against a little table that makes a small noise. the couple on the sofa come out of their embrace and look up. the man is sandro; the woman is the girl from messina. sandro looks at claudia as though he were filled with terror. the girl, instead, seems quite amused. claudia remains for a moment, staring at them as if she can't believe her own eyes, and is incapable of making any move. then, she abruptly turns away and starts running. she runs through the main hall, the reception room, the courtyard, and out into the street. there is not a soul to be seen. no sound. the day is breaking clear and serene. claudia comes over to a bench with its paint all peeling off, but she doesn't sit down. transfixed, and with her eyes almost wide open, she stares out at the sea, and at the waves which are also a mystery unto themselves. footsteps are heard approaching from behind, but claudia doesn't even bother to turn. it seems that nothing could distract her from that painful state of shock which is written all over her face. a young laborer in overalls, carrying a small bundle under his arm, passes by, glancing at her with a look of curiosity. he walks a few paces ahead, then turns around to look at her again as though she were some kind of strange creature. the sound of footsteps dies down in the distance, and everything is silent once more. there is only the gentle lapping of the waves as they roll up against the shore. claudia is completely oblivious to the scene. several birds swoop down emitting their small cries. a sudden but almost imperceptible sea breeze ripples claudia's hair. other footsteps are heard approaching: slow, heavy. claudia is still not stirred from her thoughtful, trance like state. the footsteps come to a halt directly behind her. it is sandro. he appears thoroughly crestfallen. he doesn't even have enough courage to look at claudia. his face is worn and disfigured, like that of a tired old man. and he lets himself fall limp onto the bench. they both remain completely motionless, without looking at each other. and detached: claudia standing, sandro seated. behind them, the skeleton of cement. further off, the sea. gradually, claudia turns her head towards sandro. her eyes are filled with tears. she looks down upon him as though he were something that greatly pained her. she moves up closer to the bench. sandro doesn't budge an inch. claudia reaches out to him with her hand, then slowly, gently, and with an overwhelming sense of desperation, she caresses his hair.}
