<L>__{interior michelle's bedroom dawn}
<A>__{white gauze curtains billow in the morning breeze. the sun's first rays light up the down comforter and white pillows. michelle stirs slowly, then bolts awake. she grabs luke, a vise grip around his torso. he awakens, groggy.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{hey you. ...good morning. what's up?}
<A>__{michelle bites her lip, embarrassed, releases him.}
<C>__{luke }

<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what do you want, a gender pre nup?}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{maybe. i have to go to work.}
<A>__{she nuzzles him playfully. luke glances at the clock, moans.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{only place i'm going is back to sleep.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{no. i can't show up at work like this.}
