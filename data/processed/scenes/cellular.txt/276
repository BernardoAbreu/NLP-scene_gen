<L>__{exterior parking lot night}
<A>__{ryan stopping in his tracks, looks in the direction of the gun shot. he turns around only to find a pistol pointed right at his face greer's pistol. he pushes ryan behind a suv so as not to be seen by the cops.}
<C>__{greek}
<D>__{no more bullshit! just give me the goddamn disc!}
<A>__{ryan slowly unzips his front jacket pocket and removes the}
<B>__{dvd.}
<A>__{greer snatches it and smashes it to pieces. fragments fall through the cracks in the pier, to the ocean below. ryan, pale as ghost, knows he's seconds from meeting his maker.}
<C>__{greer }
<D>__{this is about to be the most enjoyable part of an extremely shitty day.}
<A>__{and just as he's about to pull the trigger blam!! jessica fires a warning shot. greer startled, spins around to see jessica pointing hodges' gun in his face.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{tell me why i shouldn't kill you.}
<A>__{for the first time, greer actually looks frightened. recognizing the homicidal look in her eyes, he sputters, but nothing comes out. ryan, weak and pale with blood loss, looks up at his guardian angel.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{jess... jessica? don't.}
<A>__{jessica trembles with rage, a tear falls.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{i... i have to.}
<C>__{mooney }
<D>__{lower the weapon, jessica.}
<A>__{jessica looks behind her and sees mooney, surrounded by eight police officers.}

<D>__{ricky's safe. it's all going to be okay. put it down.}
<A>__{jessica slowly lowers the gun and looks into ryan's face.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{thank you for keeping your promise.}
<A>__{as the cops move in and drag greer to his feet, ryan calls out to him.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{hey man, your shitty day is about to get a whole lot shittier.}
<A>__{ryan flips open his phone and on the screen plays the security footage of the murder in the parking lot. we see that ryan must've copied the dvd with his videophone.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{ain't that a bitch?}
<A>__{and through the tears, jessica manages a laugh. a small one. but enough to let us know everything's going to be okay. and as we pull back on the scene }
