<A>__{holding a three foot section of fire hardened sapling between his feet and shoulder, he scrapes the char from the seasoned wood with his machete. he bends the bow and attaches a long piece of piano wire to one end, carefully wrapping it for strength, using strips of green tape to cover the sides of the wire where the nock of the arrow will fit. he attaches split quilled feathers with fishing line to an arrow, its tip fashioned into a series of barbs, rubbing them to a polished hardness against a smooth stone. when finished he places the arrow on the ground next to three other identical arrows.}
