<L>__{exterior the bridge day}
<A>__{captain katanga watches as his crew is crowded into a circle of nazis on the wide deck below him. he is surrounded by belloq, shliemann, and several nazis, two of whom are holding marion. now the nazis from the hold appear on the lower deck carrying the crated ark by means of the long poles. belloq's eyes shine at the sight.}
<C>__{shliemann}
<D>__{take it aboard the wurrfler!}
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{and be very careful!}
<A>__{the ark is taken away.}
<C>__{shliemann}
<P>__{(to a sergeant below)}
<D>__{what about jones?}
<C>__{sergeant}
<D>__{not a trace yet, sir!}
<C>__{katanga}
<D>__{jones is dead.}
<A>__{belloq and shliemann regard him suspiciously.}
<C>__{katanga}
<D>__{we killed him. he was of no use to us. the girl, however, has certain value where we are headed. she will bring a very good price. if that cargo you have taken was your goal, then go in peace with it. but leave us the girl. it will reduce our loss on this trip.}
<C>__{shliemann}
<D>__{savage. you are not in a position to ask for anything. we will take what we wish and then decide whether or not to blow your ship from the water.}
<A>__{belloq steps forward and puts a proprietary hand on marion's arm, fixing shliemann with a steady look.}
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{that girl goes with me. it will be part of my compensation. i'm sure the fuhrer would approve.}
<A>__{shliemann considers.}
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{if she fails to please me, you can do with her as you wish.}
<A>__{this appeals to shliemann's nature. he signals his agreement with a gesture. belloq ushers marion away with her two keepers.}
