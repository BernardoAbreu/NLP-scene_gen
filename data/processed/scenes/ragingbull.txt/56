<T>__{time cut:}
<A>__{the sign reads "round four." jake is in the center of the ring taking a relentless pasting from fox. jake's arms hang at waist level... fox lands one blow after another. the stink of a fix permeates the arena. jake is furious that fox can't deck him. he curses through his mouthpiece (as he absorbs blow after blow):}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{hit me! hit me! what's the matter with you, you motherfucker? hit me!}
<A>__{boos and catcalls echo through the garden. this is not even a fight. the referee, realizing this, steps in between fox and lamotta, waves his arms and signals that fox is the winner by a technical knockout. as he does, jake spits his mouthpiece in disgust at fox and struts back to his corner. jake, joey, and tony are already on their way out of the arena as the referee declares fox the winner. como and the others, satisfied, get up to leave.}
