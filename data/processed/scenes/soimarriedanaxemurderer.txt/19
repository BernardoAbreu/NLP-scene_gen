<A>__{stuart mackenzie is in his late fifties, a butcher, with coke bottle glasses and thick head of black hair. his red haired wife, may, is in her fifties, attractive with a soft, but tough appearance. little william, has a very large head and a skinny neck. like charlie, he was born in america. charlie gives his mom a hug, his father a kiss.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hey, william.}

<D>__{the floor; watching}
<P>__{tv)}
<D>__{hey, charlie.}

<C>__{tony}
<D>__{aye magic.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{let's have a look at the re play. william, move your head. look at the size of that ooy's heed. i'm not kidding. it's like an orange on a tooth pick.}
<C>__{may}
<D>__{stuart, you're going to give the boy a complex.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{i'm not kidding. that's a huge noggin'. it has it's own weather system. it's a virtual planetoid.}
<P>__{(shouting to william)}
<D>__{heed! move!}
<A>__{we see the re play of the goal on tv. tony sits down and may brings over a plate of stew and three types of potatoes, piled very high.}
<C>__{may}
<D>__{is that enough potatoes, charlie?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{enough to recreate devil's tower in "close encounters".}
<C>__{stuart}
<P>__{(sniffs the air)}
<D>__{do i smell haggis?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{aye, you do.}

<A>__{charlie notices tony reading some papers. he realizes it's literature from the lyndon h. larouche society.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{dad, what are you doing to tony now? why do you abuse his mind like this?}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{that's the latest report from lyndon h. larouche, outlining how the queen and the rothschilds masterminded the soviet overthrow, so that they could reclaim lands they had annexed during the holy roman empire.}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(goading charlie)}
<D>__{you know a lot of this makes sense.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i think you're suffering from the stockholm syndrome, where the hostages start to relate to their captors.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{listen, sonny jim, it's a known fact there's a society of the five wealthiest people in the world, called the pentaverate, who run everything and meet three times a year at a secret country mansion in colorado, known as "the meadows."}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{and that's obviously why we haven't heard about it in the newspapers.}
<C>__{stuart}
<P>__{(inappropriately angry & loud)}
<D>__{that's right. they fuckin' own the papers, smartass. and everything else. why do you think scotland's not been able to get independence? because the queen the pentavirate and those english dome heads in west minster won't have it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{who are the other members of this pentaverate?}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{the queen, the rothchilds, the gettys, the vatican, and colonel sanders before he went tits up. oh, i hated the colonel with his wee beady eyes. and that smug look on his face.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{dad how can you hate "the colonel?"}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{because the colonel puts an addictive chemical in it that makes you crave it fortnightly.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{interesting... coo coo}
<C>__{may}
<D>__{would anyone like a juice? charlie, did i tell you, we bought a juice tiger?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{a juice tiger?}
<C>__{may}
<D>__{aye, it's a juicer. it's part of my national enquirer, garth brooks diet. would you like potato juice?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{thank you, no.}
<C>__{may}
<D>__{sherri's late.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah, uh, sherri and i broke up.}
<C>__{may}
<D>__{oh, you didn't. sherri was the daughter your father was never able to give me.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm just not ready for marriage. i'm twenty nine and my poems haven't even been published yet.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{but it's not just the poetry is it son? you're afraid if you get married you'll lose your muse. look at me, i was a strapping young butcher, at the height of my creative powers. when it came to de boning a side of beef, there was nobody that could touch me. then i married your mother. and people would still stand in awe as i filleted a shoulder of lamb.}
<C>__{may}
<D>__{maybe it's just as well not to get married, look at the news. where did i put it?}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{heed. move that melon of yours into the bathroom and get the paper for your mother.}
<A>__{william gets the national enquirer and brings it back.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that's not news, dad. that's bullshit. i wouldn't wipe my ass with that paper.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{what are you talking about? it's the fifth highest circulating paper in the united states, i will have you know.}
<C>__{may}
<D>__{oh, here it is. mrs. x. the honeymoon murderer. she marries men under fake identities, and then murders them. she killed some german martial arts expert, and some plumber named ralph elliot. her whereabouts are unknown.}
<A>__{there's another goal on the tv set.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{scores! two nil. magic!}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{ah, beautiful goal. we hold on the tv set.}
<A>__{time passes. the tv set}
