<A>__{the station wagon pulls into the cracked driveway. the squad jumps out and runs around to the back of the car, pulling out the large black trunk.}
<C>__{kansas }
<D>__{you guys wanna hurry up? my grandparents get back from dinner at four thirty.}
<L>__{interior kansas' basement moments later}
<A>__{squad hurries down the open, unfinished stairs, lugging the trunk behind. it looks like a studio apartment a unique combination of her grandparents' old '60's furniture and high school memorabilia.}
<C>__{cleo}
<D>__{i can't believe your grandparents never come down here.}
<C>__{kansas}
<D>__{you have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs. shit i forgot to pick up the cigarettes.}
<A>__{squad forms a circle around the trunk.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{ready?}
<A>__{she flips open the latches.}
<C>__{diane }
<P>__{(with squad)}
<D>__{okay!}
<A>__{all help lift the lid. stunned silence.}
<C>__{kansas}
<D>__{what the hell?}
<A>__{we see the trunk is filled with old gun pieces. stocks, barrels, flint locks, rusty triggers, etc. nothing seems to go together. all talk at once.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{oh no...}
<C>__{kansas}
<D>__{he ikea'd us.}

<C>__{kansas}
<D>__{screw lucy!}
<C>__{grandmother }
<D>__{kansas?}
<A>__{footsteps sound at the top of the stairwell. squad quickly shuts the trunk and sits on it.}
<D>__{grandmother (o.s.) (cont'd) is that you down there?}
<C>__{kansas}
<D>__{shit!}
<P>__{(calling up)}
<D>__{yeah, grandma. me and the squad.}
<C>__{grandmother }
<D>__{are you girls talking about boys? practicing kissing your hands?}
<C>__{kansas}
<D>__{oh yeah, you caught us...}
<A>__{two old legs with sup hose and orthopedic shoes step down on the top step. squad panics. tries to quietly hide the trunk.}
<C>__{grandmother }
<D>__{oh well, then i will put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.}
<C>__{kansas}
<D>__{thanks! that'd be great.}
<A>__{old legs start back upstairs. girls relax. legs stop, turn and head back down. squad springs into action again.}
<C>__{grandmother }
<D>__{you got that big retarded girl down there?}
<C>__{kansas}
<D>__{uh...yeah, grandma.}
<P>__{(to hannah)}
<D>__{she doesn't mean that. kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.}
<C>__{grandmother }
<D>__{then i will throw a few more treats on the plate. where's my smokes?}
<C>__{kansas}
<D>__{i will get them before "touched by an angel," don't worry.}
<C>__{grandmother }
<D>__{you damn well better...}
<A>__{legs disappear. squad relaxes.}
<C>__{cleo}
<P>__{(loud whisper)}
<D>__{this is great. what do we do? threaten people with a trunk full of parts?}
<C>__{fern}
<D>__{i'm sorry, you guys. but when you're dealin' with south american rebels, you kinda gotta take what you can get.}
<A>__{squad ad libs their frustration.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{excuse me, but do you guys know what i don't see here?}
<A>__{squad ad libs "no. uh uh. what?" etc...}
<C>__{diane }
<D>__{i don't see a problem. i see a great big craft project sitting right in front of us. so, kansas, get me some glue, tape and a nail file...}
<A>__{the squad looks at each other as diane rolls up her sleeves and reaches into the trunk.}
