<L>__{interior tenement stairwell night}
<A>__{four flights up: frank and larry climbing rotting steps, gray yellow painted walls, red doors with three locks each, larry, out of breath, his stomach rolling around like a bowling ball in a bag.}

<L>__{interior burke apartment night}
<A>__{they enter 5a. mrs. burke, 55, her eyes run dry, standing in the center of the room, surrounded by neighbors. someone leads them to the bedroom where mr. burke, 60, lies unmoving, stretched on the bed. a young woman, mary burke, 24, kneels over the old man, pressing her lips to his flaccid mouth. john burke, 30, grabs franks arm:}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{we were just watching tv and dad yelled out and started punching his chest, next thing he locked himself in the bathroom. i said we were gonna call you guys and he said not to. he was crying, i never heard him crying before, then he sorta stopped. we pulled him out and put him on the bed.}
<A>__{frank and larry moving the body to the floor:}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{how long ago did he stop breathing?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{maybe ten minutes. woman on the phone tried to tell us how to do cpr. please, you gotta do something.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we'll do all we can.}
<A>__{larry ripping open mr. burke's shirt, prepping electrode patches, hooking wires, frank opening burke's mouth, feeling a puff of gas escape; larry calling for backup. burke's ekg rhythm on the monitor a flat green line. frank's training takes over: he injects the long steel laryngoscope down burke's throat, he finds a vein, injects epinephrine, followed by atrophine, followed by another epi: no response on the monitor. larry pulls out the paddles:}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{clear! clear!}
<A>__{larry activates defibrillator, shock burke's body heaves. sweat drips from larry's nose onto burke's chest.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{no more, please don't!}
<A>__{they shock him again. this time the body moves less. frank glances up: mr. and mrs. burke's wedding photo sits on the nightstand. other pictures: a day at the beach, a young serviceman, happy parents. frank's mind drifts:}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{in the last year i had come to believe in such things as spirits leaving the body and not wanting to be put back, spirits angry at the awkward places death had left them. i understood how crazy it was to think this way, but i was convinced if i turned around, i'd see old man burke standing at the window, watching, waiting for us to finish.}
<A>__{frank feels burke's heart beneath cracked ribs. the eeg remains flat. he's dead. it's time to quit.}
<C>__{frank }
<P>__{(to larry)}
<D>__{i will take over. call er and ask for an eighty three.}
<P>__{(to mrs. burke)}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{larry stands, breathing heavy, looks for a phone. frank turns to notice relatives and neighbors standing around.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{do you have any music?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{music. i think it helps if you play something he liked.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{john, play the sinatra.}
<A>__{john enters crying. mary repeats softly:}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{play the sinatra.}
<A>__{john exits. frank notices mary for the first time: blond hair dyed black, cut short, loose fitting tank dress, black makeup running down her cheeks. he notices her prom picture, glances back to mary: it seems she hasn't smiled since that day eight years before. something special about her, that something that hits you right away. "september of my years" plays from the other room. frank continues massaging mr. burke's chest (now to sinatra beat), even though it's hopeless. larry returns:}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{it's ok, frank. we can call it. eighty three.}
<A>__{frank feels something strange, looks into burke's pupils, checks his neck pulse, wrist pulse. his eyes go to larry:}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no we can't. he's got a pulse.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{no shit.}
<A>__{larry checks the monitor: the green line up and down. mary senses a change in status:}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{is he going to be alright?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(not encouraging)}
<D>__{his heart's beating.}
<A>__{a distant siren signals the arrival of backup. frank turns to larry:}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{have 'em bring up a stretcher.}
<A>__{he looks from mary back to mr. burke breathing but comatose.}
