<A>__{ray gets out and takes the last can of trash to the street as tim (in his 30s, wearing expensive clothes, slicked sharp hair, extremely well groomed, looks like (and is) rich) and ray's ex wife mary ann (in her 30s, pregnant with maternity clothes on, hair hanging loose and rather unkempt) stand at their new car. robbie (15, ragged, tough look, long hair, partially groomed, worn clothes (but looks in style), hip side pack with misc. objects in it.) and rachel (10, still dressed in barbie color scheme clothing, long unkempt hair in pigtails) are in the car.}

<A>__{robbie gets out of the car, carelessly banging the door on the electrical pole. he is listening to his mp3 player at a loud enough volume for the camera (10' away to hear).}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{there he is! you got a hug?}
<A>__{robbie ignores him as if he was not there and heads up to the front door of the house.}
