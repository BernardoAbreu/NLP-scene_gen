<D>__{what the fuck am i doing?}
<A>__{leonard glances to his right, and through a gap between two trailers he catches a glimpse of dodd on the other side of the trailer homes, racing along parallel to leonard.}
<D>__{leonard (v.o.) (cont'd) chasing him!}
<A>__{leonard cuts down the next gap between trailers, heading full speed for dodd's side. dodd (without bruises) appears again at the other end of the gap, sees leonard, and starts running towards him. there is a gun in his hand.}
<D>__{leonard (v.o.) (cont'd) fuck! he's chasing me.}
<A>__{leonard skids to a halt and turns around. a bullet hits the dirt by his feet. he clears the end of the trailer and throws himself over a chain link fence, dropping down on the other side and scrambling through some bushes. he races full tilt into a parking lot, looking around, desperate. he can hear a car alarm sounding. he pulls his keys out and hits the alarm switch. hearing the double beep as the alarm stops, he spots the jaguar. the jaguar peels out just as dodd emerges from the trailer park.}
