<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{what did you think?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{beautiful.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{did it make you want to work harder?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{never a dull moment with david, is there? if it's not concerts, it's famous authors. bit different from that lad you brought home for tea, isn't he?}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{david's a lot older than graham.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{graham could live to be two hundred, and he still wouldn't be swanning around with famous authors. hasn't got it in him.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{he might become a famous author, for all you know.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{being one isn't the same as knowing one, is it? anyone can be one. but if you move in those circles...}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, it says something about you, doesn't it? it says you're going places. it says you're well connected. he's an impressive young man, that david. i like him more and more.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{well, they say opposites attract, don't they? i wouldn't have thought he was your sort.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he wasn't. and now he is.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{is that how you feel, jenny?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i feel....i feel i should do my homework.}
