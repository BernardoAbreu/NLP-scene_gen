<A>__{an elderly woman can't hold back any longer and screams. an embarrassed, tortured helpless scream. megan dunne continues applying pressure to her arm which is being pushed back as far as it will go. she counts to three and eases off. she lays her arm back in her lap. we are in a physical therapy center. about a dozen people are on specialized weight machines. the elderly woman is seated on an exercise table and breathes slowly.}

<A>__{megan reaches up to the t.v. monitor mounted on the wall. she turns it on and starts flipping channels. she stops on espn where a swimming meet is underway. men in bikini swimsuits line the edges of the pool. virginia starts watching with great interest. megan's eyes move to the tiny print moving across the bottom of the screen. her face goes still as she reads the train number... 177.}
