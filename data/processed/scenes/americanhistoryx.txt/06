<L>__{interior derek’s bedroom – a huge american flag}
<A>__{tight on derek vinyard. the young man has a shaved head, a trimmed goatee, and a swastika on his right tit – the center of the symbol crossed perfectly at the nipple. on the top of derek in the bed is his barely of age girlfriend, stacey. the covers are completely off and a black rose is tattooed on her shoulder. danny watches in awe.}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{derek!}
<A>__{danny walks over and shakes him. startled, derek forcefully grabs his little brother’s arm.}
<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(controlled)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{stacey stops and looks over. frustrated, she rolls off derek and onto her side.}
<C>__{stacey}
<D>__{fucking pervert, dan.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{there’s a black guy outside der…breaking into your trunk.}
<A>__{derek, muscled and tattooed, jumps out of the bed and quickly puts on his skivvies. he reaches under his mattress and pulls out a sig 45 semi automatic pistol. he grabs a pair of glasses off the night stand and places them on.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{how long have they been out there?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{not long.}
<C>__{stacey}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{nobody. relax.}
<A>__{he checks the cartridge. there are no shells.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{shit. where are my boots?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i don’t know.}
<A>__{stacey sits up quickly from the bed. derek spots his black coots by the closet.}
<C>__{stacey}
<P>__{(concerned, to derek)}
<D>__{who’s out there, daddy?!}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{not right now, honey. please.}
<P>__{(to danny)}
<D>__{how many?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{one…i think.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{is he strapped?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{does he have a fucking gun, dan?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i’m not sure.}
<A>__{derek reaches into the boot, pulls out a seven clip cartridge, and fists it in.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{okay. is there a driver?}
<A>__{danny nods his head yes. derek quickly slides his feet into his united black combat boots.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{stay the fuck here.}
<A>__{he looks at his girlfriend and says nothing. she nods with confidence. tight on derek. he storms down the hall. the intensity on his face is alarming. he stops at the front door and grabs the knob, he walks over to the small kitchen window and looks out front.}
