<A>__{chad is sucking the dregs of his jamba juice up a straw when a noise brings his look around: the door to the townhouse is opening. katie emerges, in a change of clothes. harry follows in sweats. they get into her car. it pulls out. chad watches it go up the street. he is about to open his door but pauses, seeing: the parked car up the street. katie's car having passed, it now pulls out and follows at a discreet distance. both cars disappear. chad opens his door and gets out. he is crossing to the townhouse when he notices another car parked on the other side of the street. a man sits in the driver's seat, smoking. chad proceeds on to the house. there is a barred garden level door tucked under the stoop. chad checks out the caging on the door. he looks up the facade of the house.}
