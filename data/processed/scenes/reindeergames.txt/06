<L>__{exterior iron mountain state prison day}
<A>__{snow drifts down onto the stone walls and wire fences of the iron mountain, michigan s.i.c. winter's been here awhile.}
<L>__{interior prison cell day}
<A>__{rudy duncan lies in his top bunk, staring at his ceiling where a handful of paper cut snowflakes have been pasted. the sounds of yelling inmates and gates slamming shut echo through the fortress. rudy watches a spider scurry across the paper snow. it's his excitement for the day. he turns to the wall, where there's a photo of his teenage self with some co workers at an auto body shop. and a family photo, cheery midwesterners, with rudy a scowling artful dodger.}
<B>__{a wall calendar}
<A>__{shows the dates have been crossed off up to december 18th. december 22nd is circled again and again. rudy muses at the calendar, then hops out of his bunk. drops to the floor, crosses to a desk, finds a chewed on pen. turning back to the beds we reveal }
<B>__{the lower bunk}
<A>__{where rudy's cellmate, nick mason (32), rugged, mustached and well built, sleeps soundly. in contrast, his bed wall is a collage of photographs, twenty, maybe thirty of them. almost a mural. all of them photos of a beautiful young girl, mid twenties, smiling out from beaches, parties and snowy scenes. gorgeous brown hair, heartbreaking smile. effortlessly sexy.}
<B>__{rudy}
<A>__{stares at the pictures for a moment, wistful. nick snores, turns over. rudy climbs atop his bunk again, with the pen this time. and crosses december 18th off the calendar.}
