<A>__{a sinister looking satellite orbits earth's atmosphere. its bay doors suddenly open, deploying two huge solar panels. the panels shift, angling themselves in the direction of the sun. they immediately start glowing as they absorb the burning star's power. the front of the satellite begins to make a loud humming sound as it prepares to unleash its unholy power.}

<A>__{from the giant window we can see the boat is a good mile from the observatory.}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{we're now at minimum safe distance, master.}
<A>__{master mind turns from the camera he was broadcasting on and puts down the control box.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{excellent. stop here, i like this view.}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{twenty seconds until impact.}
<A>__{master mind turns to roxanne who is being held by da vinci and einstein. she almost appears a little bored. disappointed by her lack of horror, he walks over to the monitor now showing uberman trapped in the cage.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{any last words?}
<A>__{uberman looks up at the screen with a cocky smile.}
<C>__{uberman }
<D>__{yes: there's no caging the power of justice.}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{ten seconds to impact.}
<A>__{on the screen we see uberman take two of the cage's bars in his hands. he yanks...nothing.}
<C>__{plato }
<D>__{nine...}
<A>__{master mind stares at the monitor, slightly confused.}
<C>__{plato }
<D>__{eight...}
<A>__{uberman yanks on the bars again, this time using his foot as leverage.}
<C>__{master mind}
<P>__{(genuinely concerned)}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{uberman}
<P>__{(straining)}
<D>__{hold...on...a second.}
<A>__{master mind looks back at plato and einstein. they're equally befuddled at the hero's sudden weakness.}

<D>__{son of a bitch!!}
<A>__{master mind and the minions all cringe in unison. da vinci turns to roxanne not believing his ears.}
<C>__{da vinci}
<D>__{what did he just say?}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{six......five...}
<A>__{master mind begins to laugh.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{what kind of trick is this?}
<A>__{uberman looks up at the camera with a very grave expression.}
<C>__{uberman}
<D>__{like you don't know. these bars are made of copper, aren't they?}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{four...}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{yeah, so?}
<A>__{uberman tries to shield his grief with his hand.}
<C>__{uberman}
<D>__{you figured out my weakness, damn you. i can't bend copper!}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{three...}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{your weakness is copper?}
<C>__{plato}
