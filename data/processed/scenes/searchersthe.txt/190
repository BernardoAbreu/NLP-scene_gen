<L>__{exterior the nokoni agency wide angle day}
<A>__{the column of cavalry and prisoners enters the agency (colorado footage). we see the dead and wounded on travois; the agency indians watching stoically; the prisoners some of them being herded into a chapel.}
<L>__{interior office of nokoni agency full shot day}
<A>__{the office has been set up as a temporary army headquarters. the general is being interviewed by two eastern newspaper correspondents. at a table beyond is a telegrapher, sending out a report of the victory. a pot bellied stove supplies heat and the general is warming his hands at it, intermittently. an adjutant is rather wearily filling out a long official form. the general, for all his mudded boots remains a beau sabreur and is loosely modeled upon a certain other well known glory hunter of the indian wars. he wears a colonel's straps, but insists upon his brevet rank.}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{and it was clear to me the hostiles outnumbered us four to one... with all the advantage of terrain...}
<C>__{correspondent}
<D>__{four to one! what did you do, general?}
<A>__{ethan and martin enter, stand in the doorway.}
<C>__{general}
<P>__{(impressively)}
<D>__{sir we charged!... gentlemen and i hope you will quote me i cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that cheyenne camp...}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(blurting it)}
<D>__{cheyenne! what cheyenne?}
<C>__{general}
<P>__{(turning and staring)}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{that camp you hit was nawyecka comanche... chief scar's bunch...}
<C>__{correspondent}
<P>__{(fascinated)}
<D>__{scar? what a wonderful name!...}
<C>__{general}
<P>__{(to his aide)}
<D>__{are you getting this, keefer?}
<C>__{correspondent}
<P>__{(to ethan)}
<D>__{how do you spell that word nawyecka?}
<A>__{ethan ignores him, still facing the general.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{my name's edwards... i'm looking for my niece... she was in that camp when you attacked...}
<C>__{general}
<P>__{(uncertain)}
<D>__{well... i know there were some captives recovered...}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{four of 'em dead... so we were told...}
<C>__{general}
<P>__{(uncomfortably)}
<D>__{unfortunately, the hostiles murdered them as we developed the village...}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a cheyenne and a comanche?}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{keefer!... put this man under arrest!}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{that'll be the day...}
<P>__{(scornfully)}
<D>__{'as we developed the village'... next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... you won't get any headlines for killin' squaws.}
<A>__{keefer coughs.}
<C>__{keefer}
<D>__{shall i show him the captives, sir?}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{just get him out of here!}
<C>__{keefer}
<D>__{yes sir...}
<P>__{(he crosses to ethan)}
<D>__{this way...}
