<A>__{but korda bends down, picking up the bag, stepping back away from roper, clearly out of mccall's line of fire.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{well, hate to run but i've got a plane to catch. you take good care of the little lady, hear?}
<A>__{as korda walks down the corridor of the huge machine shop, we now see a car parked near the end facing us. korda suddenly stops, turning, gesturing to the car.}

<D>__{how careless of me. you see, there's only one way out of here, and you're standing right in the way.}

<A>__{he shakes his head at roper.}
<C>__{korda}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{sure hate to be in your shoes.}
<A>__{he turns, walking quickly towards his car, talking, laughing, to himself. roper looks to the car, then back at the satchel where the .45 is still taped to the bottom. but roper can't move, unable to change his position more than a foot or two. he looks around him, no way to stop the lathe if he releases the button.}
