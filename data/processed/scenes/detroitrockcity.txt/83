<L>__{interior st. sebastian's cathedral night}
<A>__{jam sits in the front pew, head buried in his hands as mrs. bruce and the priest talk on the alter. beth moves quietly in the back, unseen and unheard. she looks overwhelmed by the architecture, the detail on the stained glass windows, the icons carved into the columns that support the extravagantly decorated ceiling. the priest catches a glimpse of beth meandering in the back.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{uh, next mass isn't until tomorrow morning, young lady. run along now.}
<A>__{beth smiles nervously and heads back toward the front door passing a confessional booth. she throws a glance back at the priest and mrs. bruce who have returned to conferring, their backs to her. she stealthily ducks into the booth.}
<C>__{mrs. bruce}
<D>__{now it's been a while since my boy had holy confession. could you...?}
<C>__{priest}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{consider it done.}
<A>__{mrs. bruce looks down at jam and sees his drumsticks poking out of his socks. she immediately takes them out and stuffs them into her jacket. jam doesn't even move.}
<C>__{mrs. bruce}
<D>__{it's about time you gave up on that stupid dream once and for all. no son of mine is going to be a career musician.}
<A>__{jam is stung. mrs. bruce and the priest head back down the center aisle exiting through the gigantic front doors. she eyes jam.}
<C>__{mrs. bruce}
<D>__{thank you, father. i will be back for him before you know it; after i take care of some unfinished business.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{just knock loudly, sister.}
<A>__{he lets her out and locks the door, leaving the keys in the lock, and walks over to jam.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{come along, son. get into the booth.}
<A>__{he helps the despondent jam up. they walk to the booth and jam reluctantly gets inside.}
