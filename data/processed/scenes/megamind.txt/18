<C>__{vinnie}
<D>__{you're fired. leave your shirt and locker key.}
<A>__{this bit of news hits hal like a freight train.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{fired? are you going to tell me why?}
<C>__{vinnie}
<D>__{showing up to work late. showing up to work late drunk. sexually harassing customers. stealing from the register.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{vinnie, i don't know where you're getting these accusations }
<A>__{vinnie takes out a video tape from his desk drawer and puts in a vcr.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{oh, which one do you supposedly have here?}
<C>__{vinnie}
<D>__{this is all of them at once.}
<B>__{television}
<A>__{a woman walks up to a bowling employee and hands him a pair of shoes. as the employee turns to the wall of shoes, a very drunk and disheveled hal comes running in and pushes him aside.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{i've got this one, benny. so, cinderella. can i help you find your glass slipper?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{yeah, i'm looking for a seven.}
<A>__{he folds his arms on the counter and leans into her with a cat like grin on his face.}
<C>__{hal}
<P>__{(with a leer)}
<D>__{seven well, maybe i could interest you in something in an eight. namely, me.}
<A>__{disgusted, she walks off screen.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{lesbo.}
<A>__{suddenly realizing the register's open, he quickly grabs a stack of cash and shoves it in his pocket.}
<B>__{back to office}
<A>__{vinnie turns off the television and waits for hal to respond.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{from the angle of the camera, i can see where you might have gotten the wrong idea. listen, vinnie, i don't think you've thought this through. if you fire me, who's gonna be captain of the alley's bowling team?}
<C>__{vinnie}
<D>__{um, i don't know. maybe somebody who can actually bowl. you guys have never won a game. i hired you because you said you were on the pro circuit.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{no, i said i will be on the pro circuit.}
<C>__{vinnie}
<D>__{please, a loser like you will never amount to anything.}
<A>__{this harsh remark seems to leave hal genuinely stunned.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{wow...if that's how you feel...i guess we should then talk about what kind of severance i'm gonna get.}
