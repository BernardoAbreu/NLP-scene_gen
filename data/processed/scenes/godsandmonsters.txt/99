<L>__{interior whale's house bedroom night}
<A>__{whale pulls on a blazer.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{mr. whale?}
<A>__{whale jumps. he slaps a hand over his chest, twists around, sees clay.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh, of course. clayton. you finished your shower already?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{ten minutes ago. didn't you hear me calling?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i'm afraid not. terribly sorry.}
<P>__{(stands)}
<D>__{i believe i promised you some clothes.}
<A>__{whale crosses to the closet. barnett is nowhere to be seen.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you're much wider than i am. you won't want to attempt to get into my pants.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{no. definitely not.}
<A>__{clay chuckles. whale smiles.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{very good, clayton.}
<A>__{he takes a robe from a hook on the closet door. clay tries it on but it won't close over the towel.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{whale opens a drawer, takes out a crewneck sweater.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{absolutely swims on me, but should take care of your upper half.}
<A>__{clay pulls the sweater over his head.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{that only leaves the rest.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you don't have any baggy shorts? pajama bottoms?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{sorry. my pajamas are tailored. would it be too distressing to continue with the towel? no more immodest than a kilt, you know.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{do i have any other choice?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{very sporting of you, clayton.}
<A>__{clay notices a framed drawing on the desk.}

<D>__{is that ?}
<C>__{whale}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{the only memento i ever kept. my original sketch for the monster.}
<A>__{he hands the sketch to clay, who stares down at the famous flat head, hooded eyes, bolted neck of the monster.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{shall we?}
<A>__{clay puts down the sketch, starts into the hall. whale turns back, sees barnett standing by the window. whale flips off the light and closes the door.}
