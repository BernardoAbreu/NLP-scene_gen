<L>__{interior damone's room afternoon}
<A>__{damone expertly fills two glasses three quarters full of kahlua, then adds a few drops of milk. music is playing on a nearby speaker. damone hands the rat a drink and checks himself out in his mirror.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{see that moustache coming in, rat?}
<A>__{there is only a hint of peach fuzz, but he grooms it anyway.}
<C>__{damone }
<D>__{see? you can almost press it out.}
<A>__{damone turns around. his friend is preoccupied.}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{i am in love.}
<A>__{damone takes a sip of his drink, looks at the rat.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{you... are a wuss. part wimp. part pussy.}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{what do you mean wuss? this girl is my exact type. it's her. definitely her.}
<C>__{damone}
<P>__{(distracted)}
<D>__{it's definitely your mama.}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{damone, you gotta listen to me.}
<A>__{damone quits puttering around his room with the kahlua and milk. he grabs a chair and straddles it.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{all right... where did you see her?}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{she's in my biology class.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{did you get her number?}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{did you get her name?}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{no. it's too soon.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{it's never too soon! girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{well, what do you want me to do? go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'hello! i'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'}
<C>__{damone}
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{i would. yeah.}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{i can see it all now. this is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at fotomat this summer. you bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.}
<C>__{the rat}
<P>__{(woeful)}
<D>__{you tell me, mike. what do i do?}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{okay. okay.}
<P>__{(sighs, but loves it)}
<D>__{here's what you do.}
<A>__{damone gets up, moves to the door.}
<C>__{damone }
<D>__{you start from the second you walk into biology. don't just walk... move across the room.}
<A>__{he saunters over to the chair.}
<C>__{damone }
<D>__{don't talk to her. let her know. use your face. use your body. use everything. this is what i do. i just sent out the vibe and i have personally found that... girls do respond. something happens.}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{of course something happens. you put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{that's the idea, rat. that's the attitude.}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{the attitude? the attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. when you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have the attitude.}
