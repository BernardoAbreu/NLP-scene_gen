<A>__{panning along booted feet, four pairs of black military size twelves line up, onto... a pair of charles jourdans fives under shapely ankles. wider, revealing the four man team of navy seals. and a slender woman in her early thirties. she's attractive, if a bit hardened, dressed conservatively in a skirt and jacket. meet lindsey. project engineer for deepcore. she's a pain in the ass, but you'll like her. eventually. she's holding on grimly, sitting crammed in with the seals and a bunch of gear, getting tossed around by the storm. the seals are dressed alike in black fatigues. they are muscular, finely tuned and extremely dangerous special forces types. the leader of the seal team, lieutenant coffey, makes his way forward to the cockpit. the pilot is white knuckling his stick, trying to hold the great beast of a helicopter in position. through the windshield, the deck of the benthic explorer can be seen below, pitching in a violent sea.}

<D>__{just hold it over the deck.}
<A>__{coffey goes back to the crew deck, moving easily in the bucking craft. he nods to the others seals, monk, wilhite, and schoenick. in the open side door, wilhite clips a 100 foot nylon rope to the airframe and throws out the coil. one by one the shoulder the gear bags, grab the rope, and step out. lindsey stands swaying in the chopper door, watching the seals fast roping to the deck. one, two, three. coffey looks at her.}

<D>__{you want to be on that ship, there's only one way it's going to happen.}
<A>__{he's sure she won't go for it. it's his certainty that gets her. she sets her jaw. opening her purse she takes out a small plastic bag, puts her shoes and purse in the bag, and grips the bag in her teeth. then grabs the rope and slides down.}
