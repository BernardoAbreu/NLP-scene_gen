<D>__{i am about to let you see something i have never shown to another human being. ever. in my life.}
<A>__{carl's eyes widen in alarm.}

<A>__{she turns to an engraving of a large waterfall. a small hand drawn picture of ellie's clubhouse is glued to the top.}
<C>__{young ellie}
<P>__{(reading caption)}
<D>__{"paradise falls, a land lost in time." i ripped this right out of a library book.}

<C>__{young ellie}
<D>__{i'm gonna move my clubhouse there, and park it right next to the falls. who knows what lives up there? and once i get there...}

<C>__{young ellie}
<D>__{well, i'm saving these pages for all the adventures i'm gonna have. only... i just don't know how i'm gonna get to paradise falls.}
