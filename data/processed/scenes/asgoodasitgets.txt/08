<L>__{interior apartment building (new york) hallway night}
<A>__{as simon hears melvin through the door and takes a step back. melvin throws open the door. he looks demonic.}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(loud and angry)}
<D>__{yeeeess!!!}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{maybe this can wait.}

<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i found verdell, mr. udall.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{well, that's a load off.}
<A>__{melvin walks back into the apartment and is about to close the door when simon has another burst of bravery.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{did you... do something to him?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{do you realize that i work at him?}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(eyes downcast)}
<D>__{no, i didn't.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{no... actually, i even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{well, i work all the time. so never, never again interrupt me. okay? i mean, never. not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge packer you dated has been elected the first queer president of the united states... and he's going to put you up in camp david and you just want to share the moment with someone... don't knock ... not on this door. not for anything. got me. sweetheart?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{yes. it's not a subtle point you're making.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{okay, then.}
<A>__{melvin enters his apartment and slams the door shut.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{so the theory of confrontations is that now he'll think twice before messing with me?}
<A>__{frank smiles affectionately. simon turns serious.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{he's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{won't worry about it. you go ahead.}
<A>__{frank waits till simon exits scene and then knocks loudly on melvin's door. there is a sharp change in his demeanor.}
<C>__{melvin }
<D>__{oh, i'm pissed!! now i am really pissed!!!}
<A>__{frank waits patiently as melvin jerks his door back open. frank immediately grabs melvin by his shirt and jerks him forward... melvin is scared. operating on survival mode.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{no touch. no touch. no touch.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but i grew up in hell. my grandmother had more attitude. you don't intimidate me.}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{police! police! fucking crooked police... doughnut munching morons help me!}
<P>__{(to frank)}
<D>__{assault and battery and you're black.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{shhhh now. i like simon. i like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. meanwhile, i will try and think how you can make this up to him.}
<P>__{(suddenly loud)}
<D>__{i hate doing this. i'm an art dealer.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{have a nice day. party!}
<A>__{he tosses melvin back and walks out. melvin straightens his shirt as he steps out into the hall. frank smiles as he re enters the other apartment. melvin appears impressed.}
