<A>__{as he speaks, the questioning comes to a sudden halt as a spectacular looking woman emerges from the shadows of the house into the light of the courtyard. she is tall, latin, and besides high heels wears only a shiny, high fashion swimsuit, cut high on the legs. price, claire, and jazy stop to watch as the woman stops to look into the empty pool.}
