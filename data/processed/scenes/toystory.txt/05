<P>__{(to the room)}
<D>__{okay, everybody. coast is clear.}
<A>__{the bedroom comes alive. toys emerge from the toy box, the closet, the shelves, etc... in a flurry of activity. potato head, his body parts strewn across the floor, sits himself upright and begins to re assemble himself.}

<D>__{bad news?!}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{sh h h h h!!}
<A>__{woody covers up slinky's mouth, aware that the other toys in the room are watching. he leans in close to slinky.}

<C>__{slinky}
<D>__{got it.}
<A>__{slinky shuffles off.}
<C>__{woody}

<P>__{(aside)}
<D>__{snake, robot podium duty.}

<C>__{woody}
<D>__{hey etch! draw!}
<A>__{both etch and woody whip around like gunfighters. before woody can fully extend his arm out, the etch a sketch etches a gun on its screen.}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(pretending to be shot)}
<D>__{oh!! you got me again, etch! you've been working on that draw. fastest knobs in the west.}

<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(unaffected)}
<D>__{oh, how ya doin', rex?}
<A>__{rex suddenly turns timid.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{were you scared? tell me honestly.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{i was close to being scared that time.}
<A>__{woody heads back to the podium. rex follows.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{i'm going for fearsome here, but i just don't feel it. i think i'm just coming off as annoying.}
<A>__{a crook suddenly grabs woody's neck and jerks him towards bo peep, the porcelain figurine.}

<C>__{bo peep}
<D>__{i wanted to thank you, woody, for saving my flock.}

<D>__{whadda ya say i get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(very flustered)}

<C>__{bo peep}
<D>__{remember, i'm just a couple of blocks away.}
<A>__{woody is left lovestruck. all the rest of the toys in the room are filing past slinky.}
<C>__{slinky}
<D>__{come on, come on! smaller toys up front.}
<A>__{woody remains lovestruck in the middle of the room.}
<C>__{slinky}
<D>__{hey, woody! c'mon!}
<A>__{woody snaps out of his trance and rushes over to the podium. the toys crowd together as woody steps up to the podium. mike, a toy tape recorder, waddles up next to woody and indicates his microphone.}

<D>__{ahem!}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(grabbing microphone)}
<D>__{oh, thanks, mike.}

<C>__{hamm}
<D>__{moving buddy?! you can't be serious!}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{well i didn't know we were supposed to have one already.}
<C>__{mr. potato head}
<P>__{(waving his arm out its socket)}
<D>__{do we have to hold hands?}
<A>__{the toys laugh and snicker.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{oh, yeah, you guys think this is a big joke. we've only got one week left before the move. i don't want any toys left behind. a moving buddy if you don't have one, get one!}

<C>__{mr. spell}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{ok, uh...oh yes. one minor note here...}
<P>__{(under his breath)}

<D>__{what's going on down there? is mom losing her marbles?!}

<C>__{mr. potato head}
<D>__{of course woody ain't worried! he's been andy's favorite since kindergarten!}
<C>__{slinky}
<D>__{hey, hey! come on, potato head! if woody says it's all right, then, well, darnit, it's good enough for me. woody has never steered us wrong before.}
<A>__{while slinky speaks, potato head takes off his mouth and mimes kissing his own butt.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{c'mon, guys! every christmas and birthday we go through this.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{but what if andy gets another dinosaur? a mean one? i just don't think i can take that kind of rejection.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{hey, listen, no one's getting replaced. this is andy we're talking about.}
<A>__{woody steps down from the podium and walks towards the crowd.}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(continued)}
<D>__{it doesn't matter how much we're played with. what matters is that we're here for andy when he needs us. that's what we're made for. right?}
<A>__{everyone is now looking down, sheepish.}
<C>__{hamm}
<D>__{pardon me. i hate to break up the staff meeting, but they're here! birthday guests at three o'clock!}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{stay calm, everyone!!}
<A>__{too late. the toys panic and stampede over woody towards the bedroom window, leaving him alone on the floor.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{uh, meeting adjourned.}
<A>__{the toys all crowd around the bedroom window, trying to get a peek outside.}
<C>__{hamm}
<D>__{oh, boy. will ya take a look at all those presents?!}
<C>__{mr. potato head}
<D>__{i can't see a thing!}
<A>__{unable to see over the crowd, potato head pulls his eyes out of his head and holds them up over the other toys. angle: toy's pov of andy's front yard children file towards the front door carrying presents.}
<C>__{hamm}
<D>__{yessir, we're next month's garage sale fodder for sure.}
<C>__{rex}
<P>__{(panicked)}
<D>__{any dinosaur shaped ones?}
<C>__{hamm}
<D>__{ah, for crying out loud, they're all in boxes, you idiot!}
<A>__{the presents keep coming.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{they're getting bigger.}
<C>__{slinky}
<D>__{wait! there's a nice little one over there!}
<A>__{at first, the kid's present appears to be a little box, but then the kid turns the present is four feet long. the toys scream.}
<C>__{mr. spell}
<D>__{spell the word "trashcan."}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{we're doomed!}
<A>__{down on the floor, woody smacks his hand to his forehead in surrender.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{alright! alright!}
<A>__{the toys turn inside and look down at woody.}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(continued)}

<C>__{rex}
<D>__{yes! yes! we promise!}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{okay, save your batteries!}
<C>__{hamm}
<D>__{eh, very good, woody. that's using the old noodle.}

<C>__{woody}
<D>__{sargent. establish a recon post downstairs. code red. you know what to do.}
<C>__{sargent}
<D>__{yes sir!}

<C>__{sargent}
<D>__{alright men, you heard him. code red! repeat: we are at code red! recon plan charlie. execute! let's move move move!!}
