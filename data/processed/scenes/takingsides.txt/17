<L>__{interior waiting room day}
<A>__{rode is seated, waiting. nervous, tense. the sound of laughter, david's laughter from the office. it makes him even more uncomfortable.}
<L>__{interior steve's office suite day}
<A>__{emmi and david laughing.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i clicked my heels, saluted and bowed at the same time.}
<A>__{he demonstrates. she laughs again.}
<C>__{emmi}
<D>__{that's because you had a proper upbringing.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{that's right. i was raised very strictly. so don't speak before you are spoken to!}
<C>__{emmi}
<D>__{oh! and don't wave your hands about!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{respect your elders and your betters!}
<C>__{emmi}
<D>__{and no elbows on the table!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{eating is eating... and...}
<C>__{emmi}
<D>__{and talking is talking! well, i think we better get on.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{right. so, this is going to be very formal, too, now. lieutenant david wills requests die pleasure of die company of fraulein emmi straube at dinner any night she cares.}
<A>__{she smiles just as steve bursts in. he's in a bright, cheerful, energetic mood. david draws back guiltily. emmi, embarrassed, hesitates then turns to the typewriter and types furiously. seeing this, steve stops, but just for a brief moment. then, as he goes to his desk:}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{david, need to ask you something. you heard this rumour the british found something called the hinkel archive?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{so what is it?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{the british occupy the building where this guy, hinkel, ran the nazi ministry of culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{what's that mean?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i don't know, but the british are excited about it, i know that. the rumour is hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the third reich.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{jeez. and you think the british'll share it with their allies?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{major richards said he'd call to let us know.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{that's big of him.}
<A>__{he looks from david to emmi as if trying to work out something. then:}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{okay, better question the next witness. i bet you a bottle of french champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{five minutes.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{it's a bet. you're the witness, emmi.}
<A>__{later. rode in the witness chair. steve studying the file. david and emmi ready to take notes.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{helmuth alfred rode. second violinist since 1935. what's it mean, second violinist?}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{it means i wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.}
<A>__{he chuckles, looks around for approval. steve grins encouragingly.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{good, and according to your questionnaire, helmuth, you never joined the nazi party.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{me? never. never.}
<A>__{long silence.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{i... i know everyone now says they were never nazis but in my case it is absolutely one hundred per cent true. i am a catholic, it would have been totally against my conscience.}
<A>__{silence. steve lights a cigarette; rode eyes it hungrily.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{is it true you're going to interview dr. furtwangler today?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i will ask the questions, helmuth.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{excuse me. did you know that he refused to give the nazi salute when hitler was present in the audience?}
<A>__{steve flicks david a glance, waggles his finger like a baton.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{the problem was how could he avoid giving the devil's salute when satan was actually sitting there.}
<P>__{(modestly taps his}
<D>__{chest with his}
<P>__{thumb.)}
<D>__{and, i said, 'dr. furtwangler, why not enter with the baton in your right hand? hitler will be sitting in the front row. if you give the salute with the baton in your right hand it'll look like you're going to poke his eyes out.'}
<A>__{chuckles. david mouths i win to steve.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{he was...he was really grateful to me for that. after the concert, i... i stole that baton as a memento of a great act of courage. i still have it. i should have brought it to show you. i hope i'm not going too fast for you, fraulein? }
<C>__{emmi}
<D>__{straube.}
<A>__{steve and david exchange a brief look.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{straube. any relation to colonel joachim straube?}
<C>__{emmi}
<D>__{my father.}
<C>__{rode}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{i am deeply honoured to be in your presence, fraulein straube. your father was a true patriot, a man of god.}
<A>__{he crosses himself. silence. david raises a discreet finger.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you have a question for helmuth, david?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes. what was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for hitler's birthday?}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before it was the 19th of april not the 20th.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{do you know hans hinkel?}
<C>__{rode}
<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{do i know hans hinkel?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{that's what i asked.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{do i know hans hinkel?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{hans hinkel was in the ministry of culture; how could i know such a man? i}
<A>__{brief silence; a smile.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{i hear the british have his... his archive, files, records.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{do you know what's in this archive?}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{how could i know what's in the archive?}
<A>__{steve nods, smiles.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{okay, you can go now, helmuth. get out.}
<A>__{rode stands and bows.}
