<L>__{interior staircase}
<A>__{morrie and pk rush up the stairs, stop at the landing, and collect themselves before opening the door to the gym. they take a breath and enter.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior gym}
<A>__{a down and dirty boxing gym, humming with the rhythm of men training. sweat and smoke fill the air along with the faint scent of blood. fighters, both black and white, train with each other. morrie is amazed.}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{how do they get away with this?}
<A>__{but pk has his mind on other things. his eyes fix on an old man across the room standing by ringside.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{there he is.}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{christ, he's old.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{and he's the best. c'mon.}
<A>__{pk leads morrie across the gym. pk passes an african fighter. he stops training when he sees pk. he turns to another african fighter, glancing at pk. one by one the blacks in the gym stop training to look at pk. pk and morrie approach the rheumy old man yelling at the two fighters in the ring above him in a thick polish jewish accent.}
<C>__{solly }
<D>__{no, no. god gave you two hands so you can knock a man out from either side. left right.}
<A>__{he moves his creaky body back and forth to demonstrate.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{mr. goldman?}
<A>__{solly turns to the boys. a look of bemusement comes over his face when he sees their blazers.}
<C>__{solly}
<D>__{what? you boys lost?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{i'm the one who called you yesterday. from the prince of wales school?}

<C>__{solly}
<D>__{oy gevalt.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know you train here it's not like those nice school fights you're used to. three knockdowns you win.}
<A>__{just then, as if to underscore his point, one of the fighters in the ring gets caught witha solid shot to the jaw. he hits the canvas inches from where they are standing. solly, pk and morrie all look at him, and then at each other.}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{what does it cost for you to train him?}
<C>__{solly}
<D>__{for my personal attentinons, mr. manager? fifty pounds a month. for one of them...}
<P>__{(points to the other}

<C>__{solly}
<D>__{six months? i don't know your boy'll last six minutes.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{i will last.}
<A>__{solly notices that every black fighter in the gym has stopped working and is staring at pk.}
<C>__{solly}
<D>__{what are you staring? punch, don't stare. c'mon. work or you're out.}
<A>__{the blacks go back to work.}

<C>__{pk}
<D>__{thank you, sir.}
<A>__{pk heads towards the rear. solly turns to morrie.}
<C>__{solly}
<D>__{why's he want to do this, a nice looking schoolboy?}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{he wants to be welterweight champ of the world.}
<A>__{solly breaks up laughing.}
<C>__{solly}
<D>__{oh sure, sure. and i'd like to be twenty five again.}
