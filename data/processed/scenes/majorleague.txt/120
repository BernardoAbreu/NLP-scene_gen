<B>__{yankee hitter}
<A>__{lining a single to right field. harris mops his brow, obviously tiring.}
<B>__{another yankee hitter}
<A>__{smashing a double off the wall, the lead runner stopping at third. brown signals to the bullpen to get somebody warm.}
<B>__{harris}
<A>__{on the mound, looking like he's out of gas.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{activity continues in the pen, as harris is really digging himself a hole now. he got the first two hitters, and then gave up a single and a double and has now gone 3 0 to cheevers.}
<A>__{harris comes set and fires to the plate. it's way high.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{high, ball four and they're loaded for haywood, the biggest indian killer of them all.}
<A>__{brown has seen enough. he makes his way to the mound.}
<C>__{brown}
<P>__{(taking the ball from harris)}
<D>__{you pitched a hell of a game, steve. take a seat and we'll see if we can get this guy for ya.}
<A>__{brown signals to the bullpen with his left hand.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{give me vaughn.}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{you want vaughn?}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i know he hasn't done real well against this guy, but i got a hunch he's due.}
<B>__{vaughan}
<A>__{striding in from the bullpen. he doesn't look relaxed. as he nears the infield he purposely doesn't look at dorn. dorn stares at him with undisguised venom. as vaughan gets to the mound, he sees patton getting his convict uniform on in the yankee dugout. he looks away to see haywood in the on deck circle smiling out at him. meanwhile, the crowd has gone nuts at the sight of vaughn. bobby, vic and johnny are blasting out "wild thing" on the tom toms and the whole stadium, 75,000 strong, is singing it. doyle just pushes the mic forward and lets the crowd do it's work.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{okay, ricky, haywood likes the hard stuff in. curve him on the hands, bust him away, and don't get up with anything. you listenin' to me rick?}
<A>__{vaughn nods, but we can tell he's too nervous to have digested any of that.}
<C>__{brown}
<P>__{(patting him on the butt)}
<D>__{o.k., kid, you're my man. let's go get him.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{c'mon ricky, this guy is the out you been waitin' your whole life for.}

<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{o.k. vaughn has finished his warmup and we're ready to...}
<A>__{no sooner has taylor settled in behind the plate, than dorn starts toward the mound. vaughn watches him come with fear and trepidation.}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(seeing it)}
<D>__{oh, shit.}
<A>__{dorn arrives at the mound, and holds out his hand for the ball. vaughn gives it to him. dorn rubs it up, staring long and hard into vaughn's eyes. vaughn is sweating bullets. finally dorn speaks.}
<C>__{dorn}
<D>__{let's cut through the crap. i only got one thing to say to you. just rear back and strike this motherfucker out.}
<A>__{he smiles and hands vaughn the ball back. vaughn returns the smile and accepts the ball. while dorn trots back to his position, vaughn turns his back to the plate for one last moment of concentration. as he turns around to face us, we see a new man as the wicked opening chords of x's "wild thing" are heard on the track, only louder and more savage than before. vaughn steps up on the rubber, his face hardened into fierce resolve. there's nothing nervous about him now. this kid is gonna make somebody pay.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{haywood steps in, the american league triple crown winner. .341 average, 48 homers, 121 r.b.i.'s. he's homered the only two times he's faced vaughn.}
<A>__{taylor sets down a sign. two fingers for the curve ball. vaughn shakes it off. taylor puts down another sign. vaughn shakes it off. finally, taylor puts down one finger the fast ball. vaughn nods with steely purpose.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{all right, ricky, let's get nasty.}
<A>__{vaughn winds and delivers a hissing blur toward the plate. haywood takes a ferocious swing and misses. strike one. we see the number 97 come up on the digital readout of the speed gun which a club employee holds behind the screen.}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(to haywood)}
<D>__{all right, looks like the boy is pumped. sucker was movin', wasn't it? ever hit ya, it'd leave a two foot hole comin' out.}
<A>__{taylor gets ready to flash another sign. the convict jumps up and down trying to distract vaughn. no way.}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(for haywood's ears)}
<D>__{let's see, what should we call now. let's see how he feels about old number one.}
<A>__{taylor puts down one finger. vaughn nods and then winds and fires again, another blazing rocket. haywood takes a wicked rip, but doesn't get it. strike two. 99 comes up on the gun. the convict has stopped jumpin'.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{nice swing, haywood. good follow through. keep it up, i will show you the ball sometime.}
<A>__{the fans are going wild. they're all standing now, yelling for a strikeout. vaughn gets back up on the rubber with the look of an animal sighting prey. taylor gets down to give the sign. dugout (insert storyboard # 216r)}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{forget the curveball. go with the heater.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{well, shit, all these pitches to choose from. maybe we'll try somethin' different this time.}
<A>__{taylor wiggles his fingers around and then puts down the big no. 1. vaughn gives him a quick nod.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{and if i don't see you again, haywood, have a nice winter. okay, buddy?}
<A>__{vaughn goes into his windup and unleashes a screaming bullet toward the plate. haywood pulls the trigger, but it's already by him. strike three. 101 on the gun. taylor leaps up and gives vaughn the fist. the fans are going berserk. music ends.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{oh, lordy, three straight heaters and the yankees are blown down. no runs, two hits, three left on, and, are you ready, cleveland? we go to the bottom of the ninth, still tied at two.}
<A>__{doyle turns the mike off.}
<C>__{doyle}

<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{two down in the ninth, hayes steps in hitting .291, trying to get something going for the tribe.}
<A>__{taylor and the others yell encouragement to hayes as he digs in at the plate. the yankee pitcher delivers and hayes hits a high bouncer toward short. the shortstop waits for it to come down and then fires to first. too late. hayes streaks across the bag, beating the throw by a hair. once again the crowd comes to life. the yankee manager comes to the mound and waves for a new pitcher.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{and horton is wasting no time. he's goin' to the duke.}
<A>__{out of the pen comes billy duke, a good facsimile of goose gossage only duke is bigger and meaner. (insert storyboard #219m)}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{duke leads the league in saves, strikeouts per inning and nose hairs.}
<A>__{the duke finishes his warmups and stares over at hayes. hayes smiles, snaps his black gloves out of his hip pocket, and carefully pulls them on over his hands. the duke does not care for this kind of showmanship. brown comes over to talk to taylor, who's been watching duke from the on deck circle.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{ya know i'd be an ass not to pinch hit for you here. you're 0 for 18 against duke. plus you're beat to shit you can hardly walk, there's no way you can get around on this guy's fast ball. so i want the absolute truth here. can you beat this guy?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{yeh.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{taylor starts for the plate, as duke finishes his warmups. brown comes down the dugout steps.}
<C>__{brown}
<P>__{(to pepper)}
<D>__{send hayes the first pitch. i don't want taylor takin' too many strikes.}
<A>__{pepper begins flashing signs out to hayes. duke gets up on the rubber and takes his stretch. hayes leads away, crouching low. duke snaps a throw over to first, the first baseman slapping a hard tag on hayes, but hayes is back. the crowd is on its feet again. the "go" chant starts, punctuated by thousands of black gloved hands punching the night air. duke comes set again. hayes leads away. duke watches him, checks him again. we go to slow motion as duke kicks and comes to the plate. hayes takes off like a shot, head down, eating up ground. taylor swings and misses. the yankee catcher comes up throwing, rifling a clothesline dart to second base. hayes leaves his feet diving for the bag. the second baseman snaps down the tag. too late. hayes is in there. the stadium is really rockin' now. duke prowls the mound. taylor steps out of the box and flashes a sign to brown.}
<C>__{pepper}
<D>__{what's he doing?}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{flashing some signals. that's a hell of an idea.}
<A>__{brown flashes a sign out to hayes. a hint of a smile comes over hayes' face as he dusts himself off. taylor steps back in as duke gets up on the rubber. taylor digs in his back foot, then points to the left field bleachers ala babe ruth.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{what's this? taylor is pointing to the bleachers, calling his shot.}
<A>__{the crowd, electrified by taylor's gesture, remains on its feet. duke stares in at taylor, comes to his stretch and then lets go a steaming fast ball right at taylor's head. taylor goes down in a swirl of dust, the ball missing him by inches. the stadium explodes with boos, but as soon as taylor picks himself up, the crowd begins to roar again. bobby, vic and johnny are pounding out a heavy beat on the tom toms. everyone in the stadium begins to clap in unison with the drums. taylor steps back in and once again points to the bleachers.}
<C>__{doyle }
<P>__{(taylor points again)}
<D>__{unbelievable. they're on their feet here, stomping, clapping. c'mon, join in wherever you are out there. let's hear you, cleveland.}
<B>__{the longshoremen}
<A>__{and several of their friends at their bar, huddled around the radio with the punks and heavy metal kids we saw before. slowly they begin to clap in time with the tom toms which are audible on the t.v.}

<A>__{at the opera with his wife, a radio earplug in his ear. his hand taps on his leg in sync with the tom toms.}
