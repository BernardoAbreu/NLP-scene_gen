<L>__{interior corridor "a" same}
<A>__{carefully the three move into the lower ring corridor. as they move we suddenly hear a new sound, deep, like distant thunder. the sides of the shack tremble slightly.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{the shack...}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{she's wondering what's happening. we're losing air faster than i thought.}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(to jones)}
<D>__{which way?}
<A>__{jones moves to the lead and turns down corridor "a."}
<L>__{interior corridor "a"}
<A>__{the sound of the power wrench removing the bolts from the flooring. the cover is removed and beck and jones peer down into the darkness. willie stands guard with the flame thrower. on jones he peers into the darkness below. he wasn't a big fan of the bilge even before the creature, now he's scared shitless.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i will go first.}
<A>__{before jones can protest beck drops the ladder and climbs down into the dark bilge. jones waits till he's at the bottom, then starts down behind him. willie looks back.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{don't spend all day down there.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{don't fuckin' worry, i ain't.}
<B>__{bilge}
<A>__{from somewhere in the darkness we hear the hissing sound of escaping oxygen and the familiar rattle of the air system. as soon as jones reaches the bottom rung beck shines a light into the eerie underground area. pipes run overhead and on the walls. a broken electrical conduit sparks over their heads. the floor is ankle deep in greasy water. they start toward the noise.}
<B>__{on willie}
<A>__{her back is to the solid wall(outside wall). her eyes move from one end of the corridor to the other, not lingering long enough to distract her. sweat runs down her face and we hear another tremor in the shack.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(to herself, calming herself)}
<D>__{okay, williams...let's hear a tune.}
<P>__{(beat, quietly at first)}
<D>__{"off we go...into the wild blue yonder..."}
<A>__{another rumble from the shack causes her to pause. she catches her breath and starts again.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{"...flying high into the sky..."}
<A>__{she suddenly looks into the main machine area (behind the wire mesh of the other wall). was it something moving?}
<B>__{bilge}
<A>__{on beck he moves around a corner we recognize from before with jones' and cobb's repair. beck floods the area with light and the break in the line is visible. the pipe has been torn from the wall, it is totally unreparable. what's worse, electrical wires hang down, showering sparks into the water.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{jesus christ...}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{can you fix it?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{no way...}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{think! can we stop it?! block it up?! shut down the line somewhere?! think!}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{i am thinking, man! you think i want to die! i am thinking! i }
<A>__{suddenly his eyes widen. beck sees this and turns. in his light we see the glint of long teeth and the huge black frame of the cobb doc creature! it's leech like appendage whipping in front of it like an excited cat's tail. before it can strike, jones pushes beck out of the way and fires a blast of flame from his flamethrower. the creature screams and disappears. as beck falls his light lands in the bilge water and goes out sending the bilge into greater darkness.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{i hit it. but i can't see it! can you see it?!}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{jones looks back at the ruptured pipe and suddenly has a thought.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{the swamp. there's an over ride switch in the swamp.}
<A>__{they start for the ladder when wwwwhhhhhhhhip! out of the darkness the appendage wraps like a bullwhip around jones' arm. the deadly proboscis, which stabbed cobb, is poised like a dagger about to be plunged into the black man's thigh.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{ahhh!}
<A>__{instinctively beck whips out the mining saw and severs the tentacle. the unseen creature's scream echoes through the bilge. beck grabs jones by the arm and pulls him toward the ladder.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{hurry...get out!}
<A>__{quickly they slosh toward the ladder and hole in the floor fifteen feet away, moving closer...ten...eight....then suddenly another appendage thrusts between the rungs of the ladder at them. beck ducks and leaps to the side. he is less than six feet from the creature. in the dim light we see it wickedly bare its teeth. beck's eyes go to the walls from one side to the other and spot the exposed power cable. the creature steps forward directly under the hole in the floor. it is about to lunge when a voice from above distracts it.}
<C>__{willie's voice}
<D>__{hey, you?}
<A>__{the creature looks up and sees: on willie standing over the opening, her flamethrower pointed straight down. she fires, sending a searing blue}
<B>__{flame into the bilge.}
<A>__{beck watches the flame roar down on the monster and it gives him the moment of distraction he needs. he leaps out of the bilge water and onto a pipe on the wall then rips the broken power cable from the wall.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{jones! get your feet out of the water!}
<A>__{jones jumps up and grabs a pipe running overhead as beck thrusts the sparking cable into the water at the creature's feet.}
<B>__{in a blinding flash of electricity}
<A>__{the current surges through the cobb doc creature sending it instantly rigid. a second later it crashes forward into the water. moving hand over hand toward the ladder jones quickly climbs out, followed by beck. the shack continues to shake, each jolt stronger than the last. as they emerge willie helps them.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{c'mon, the swamp!}
<A>__{they start for the swamp down corridor "a" when an enormous shudder goes through the shack, causing the lights to blink and the floor to open beneath beck. the jolt knocks him back into the bilge. only grabbing onto the pipes just above the water stops him from falling back in. jones stops and looks back over the missing grating.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{beck!}
<A>__{jones moves instinctively back for him, but another jolt only widens the gap. beck yells to be heard over the din of the collapsing shack.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{go on!}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{that's an order!}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{fuck your orders!}
<A>__{he leaps across the gap onto a remaining grating and thrusts his hand down into the darkness. beck lets go of one hand, then the other, to grab jones' extended arm. in one herculean effort jones pulls him out of the bilge. together they leap across the chasm as the desalinization conduit collapses over their heads and water floods into corridor "a" behind them. they have to go around the other way!}
<B>__{as they run}
<A>__{klaxon horns sound and a recorded female voice warns: "five minutes until implosion..."}
