<L>__{40 some years of life experience like a medal. smoke hangs}
<A>__{in the air and empty beers, a pint of vodka and two empty carafes of cheap hotel wine clutter the table as whip snatches up his phone and answers...}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{for the love of christ! look...just hold...hold on.}
<A>__{he aggressively drains the last four inches of beer from a clear bottle and cracks the last fresh one that bobs in the hotel ice bucket. the naked, young woman bends over to pick up her clothes. we witness her ass as a tanned glass vase with a perfect crack down the middle. whip smiles, taking it all in...}
<C>__{whip}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{i've been up since the crack 'a dawn. what check? tuition? how much does it cost to go there?}
<A>__{the young woman has re lit the last half of a joint and is puffing it to life as whip is beckoning with his large hands. the young woman, looking more like a stripper by the second, hands the joint to whip who takes a masterful drag. whip shakes his head in violent disapproval to what he hears on the phone. he exhales in anger as he shouts into the phone.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{no! no! no! you decided he needed private school...lemme talk to knuckles. he's not? tell'em the phone works both ways. oh he's my son because you need a tuition check...that's great deana. i'm glad you tracked me down in orlando at 7 in the fucking morning to shake me down for money. does he even like the fucking school? no i've never seen it. yeah i wonder why not too. i gotta 9 o'clock flight, sit tight 'till i get back to atlanta. how am i a liar? what? no, i will call you.}
<A>__{whip hangs up and continues to make quick work of the last beer as he stares through his thoughts and out the window.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{was that your wife?}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{that was my ex wife. but you trina, you could be my second or third wife if you'd just c'mere.}
<A>__{the young woman we now know as trina smiles seductively...}
<C>__{trina}
<D>__{whip, don't even joke about that. our flight's at 9, let's hit it.}
<A>__{trina is still naked but she holds a navy blue skirt and a white blouse as she hands whip his pants. whip can't help but pat that perfect ass as trina tries to skip away. on the radio we hear the opening bars of a familiar rock anthem...joe cocker's "i'm feeling alright"}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{yeah, i'm feelin' a little light headed. i shoulda ate somethin'.}
<A>__{whip leans over the motel table, picks up a soda straw that's been cut in half. he efficiently sniffs up a line of coke.}
