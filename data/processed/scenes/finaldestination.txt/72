<L>__{exterior main street day}
<A>__{braking loudly, startlingly, a public bus pulls into camera and stops. the doors hiss open.}
<C>__{clear }
<D>__{the mortician was whacked.}
<A>__{camera adjusts as alex and clear step off the bus and onto the street.}
<C>__{clear }
<D>__{he was trippin' on formaldehyde.}
<A>__{clear starts up the street, but alex grabs her arm and steps back, assuring the bus moves off... safely. he nods, "it's safe to go." throughout the following, his eyes are searching for anything potentially deadly.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{he said death has a design. even before he said that i had been seeing patterns.}
<C>__{clear}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{as in flannels and plaids?}
<A>__{up ahead, scaffolds rise before a building being restored. o.s., hammering and construction work pound from above. in the f.g., tools and metal spikes. after a "thumbs up" gesture, the rope is pulled up and out of frame.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{how many died on flight 180? from our group?}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{thirty nine.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{remember the gate number?}
<A>__{as clear takes a moment to consider, alex steers them well around the scaffolds, eyes skyward during the move...}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{thirty nine.}
<A>__{this is a creepy fact. even though past the construction, alex checks over his shoulder to assure they are out of harm's way.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{remember the departure time?}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{like... 4:25.}
<A>__{reaching an intersection, alex pushes the pedestrian traffic light button, then steps well away from the curb.}
<B>__{pedestrian traffic signal}
<A>__{the halting red hand is lit.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{do you know when i was born?}
