<L>__{interior sylvia's studio apartment night}
<A>__{jack, holding a bouquet of flowers and graton's rabbit, rings the doorbell of an apartment. on the door a card reads "sylvia and mary." a chubby young man with thick glasses opens the door.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hi. is sylvia in?}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{no, she'll be back in a couple of hours around midnight, she said...}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{wanna come in and wait for her?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sure... why not?}
<A>__{he follows the young man in sylvia's studio. it's very messy. on the table there's a big heap of books and papers. mary, sitting on the floor, is wearing a diaper and a sweater, but her legs are bare. she's playing with an empty pack of cigarettes. she looks at jack with a serious, unruffled expression.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sylvia doing okay?}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{i don't know i'm a med student. i'm just babysitting. i only met her a couple hours ago.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, i see...}
<A>__{silence. the young man sits down at the table and immerses himself in his books. mary doesn't look up from her pack of cigarettes anymore.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{listen, on second thought, i don't think i will wait for her. just give her this when she gets back, okay? and this is for the baby.}
<A>__{jack hands the bouquet and the rabbit to the young man, who plops them down on a chair.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{sure, no problem.}
<A>__{he immerses himself again in his books. jack heads toward the door, then turns around.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{shouldn't the baby be in bed by now?}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{yeah... i don't know... when i put her to bed she cries so i just let her stay up...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't you have any tights to put on her legs?}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{tights?... well, it's pretty hot in here anyway...}
<A>__{jack gets out of there in a hurry.}
