<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{the agents open the door, and precede him, surveying the area. they check the cars waiting, each with two agents. they check the gate and note the military sentries. then they stand aside, and let pentangeli come out. they get close to his side, and it is obvious they will protect his life with their own.}
