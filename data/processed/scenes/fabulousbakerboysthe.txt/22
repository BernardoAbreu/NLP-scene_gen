<A>__{jack places a record on the turntable and sits at the piano by the window. as the needle hits the spinning disc, a sharp, snappy bass line reverberates throughout the apartment. jack takes a drink, then joins in with the record, playing along. his concentration is intense, so much so that, a moment later, when the phone rings, he seems not to hear it. finally, he picks it up.}
