<L>__{interior library afternoon}
<A>__{meagan pours through a big psychology book. across the table, jesse peers into another psychology book.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{find anything?}
<A>__{jesse looks up suddenly.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{what? oh, no... nothing yet.}
<A>__{over jesse's shoulder we see he has a copy of road & track tucked inside his psychology book.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{did you know that our sub conscious retains everything that ever happened to us? everything. from the time we're born until we die.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{that's how freddy gets at us... by using our sub conscious fears. fears our conscious minds have repressed or forgotten.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i've got a news flash for you... freddy's dead.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{i'm not so sure... if freddy exists in our sub conscious then he can never be fully erased. like a bad memory... you may blot it out of your mind but it will alway be hiding someplace in your dreams.}
<P>__{(off jesse's disbelieving stare)}
<D>__{weren't you scared as a child by something so stupid that you're ashamed to admit it?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{well, yeah.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{well, what? what is it?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{well... when i was kid, my brother took me to the carnival. and in the penny arcade there was this robot gunslinger...}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{black bart.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{you know about black bart?}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{duh. you put your quarter in and he says, "go ahead and draw, tenderfoot." and then you pull your gun out and shoot him.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{that's just it i never could! i'd point the gun right at him and shoot, and i could never hit the guy. so i always got killed.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{no one can hit him it's a gyp.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{scared the shit out of me.}
<A>__{meagan tries to hide her smile.}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(continuing; flustered)}
<D>__{isn't that scary? i mean... for a kid?}
<A>__{meagan laughs. somebody shushes her.}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(continuing; mad)}
<D>__{okay, smartass... what about you? what scared you the most as a kid?}
<A>__{a dark mood falls over meagan as her mind winds back.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{i remember... lizzy wandered off one day and we couldn't find her. the police came and everything. i wasn't really worried until i saw her picture on tv... then i got really scared.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{jesse, i can't explain it... but i think something bad's going to happen.}
