<A>__{it's a small town version of a 7 11, kept open by an owner anxious to cash in on the later night munchies of beer drinkers. good idea. bad luck. jerry skims through a girly magazine, turning the pages with the gun. butch, wearing larry's plaid jacket, jimmies open the cash register. he looks to the floor then to... jerry, who catches butch's gaze, holds it, looks down at the floor, then, smiling, looks back to butch. he returns to the skin mag. butch holds his stare at jerry then, in one move, grabs a wad of cash and hops over the counter and out of the store. jerry notices butch leaving, grabs a handful of assorted brach's candies and hurries after.}
