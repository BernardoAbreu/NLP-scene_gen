<L>__{37interiorshower room day}
<A>__{steam partially obscures the girls as they whoop and holler and cavort under individual showers. they banter little barbed pleasantries, bits of sexual information, family plaints, talk of college all of which we hear from separate stalls. one by one the showers are turned off, the girls stepping out, removing pastel bathing caps, toweling, spraying deodorant, bras hooked, underpants stepped into. steam hangs in the air. so do words, running into one another, tumbling, drifting. `...tommy says he hated it on me... my sister's husband picks his nose... so does your sister... too cheap to spend a penny... we'll go after school... i'm going with billy, we'll meet you... friday night...' we pick up miss collins as she steps among the girls, spies carrie still standing under the shower. she claps her hands together once, smartly.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{what are you waiting for, carrie?}
<P>__{(as carrie looks at her)}
<D>__{bell in five minutes.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{oh uh?}
<A>__{as collins departs, and the other girls start to move toward their lockers, carrie is left alone in her shower stall. she is soaping herself. in a virtual reverie, she begins at her shoulders, moving her hands over her breasts in small, regular, virtually erotic circles. her hand goes out of frame, below her stomach. slowly, it emerges back into frame full of blood. and just as she and we see this, so do the girls.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{peer iod! peer iod!}
<A>__{carrie stares at her dumbly. the other girls are quick to take up the chant. chris leads them.}
<C>__{girls}
<D>__{peer iod! peer iod! peer iod! peer iod!}
<A>__{one voice chimes in:}
<C>__{norma}
<D>__{plug it up!}
<A>__{others take up this new chant. for a while, like counterpoint, he chants overlap; then the new chant emerges solely:}
<C>__{girls}
<D>__{plug it up! plug it up! plug it up! plug it up!}
<A>__{dime sized drops are striking the tile floor at carrie's feet.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{for god's sakes, carrie, you got your period.}
<P>__{(as carrie turns toward her)}
<D>__{clean yourself up!}
<A>__{carrie seems bewildered.}
<C>__{sue}
<P>__{(furiously)}
<D>__{you're bleeding! you dumb pudding, you're bleeding!}
<A>__{carrie looks down and wails, the sound is very loud. a tampon strikes carrie's chest, plops to her feet. carrie just stares at it.}
<C>__{norma}
<D>__{she thinks they're for lipstick.}
<A>__{behind her, another girl pretends to throw up. shrieks of laughter. another tampon strikes carrie. another. the girls are bombarding her with tampons and sanitary napkins, some from purses, some from the broken dispenser on the wall. as they bombard carrie:}
<C>__{girls}
<D>__{plug it up, plug it up, plug it up, plug it up....}
<A>__{we isolate sue snell at the moment she joins in the chant, and watch her beginning to be caught up in what can only be described as a fury. carrie howls and begins to back away, howling louder and louder. the door is flung open by collins.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{what is this?}
<A>__{and she takes it in. she jerks the whistle to her mouth, blows and blows! the sound is louder than a shriek (which it resembles) or a howl (which it doesn't). and there is sudden silence.}
<C>__{collins}
<P>__{(to girls)}
<D>__{get out! get out!}
<A>__{the girls retreat, sue last.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{it must be her first...}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{out!}
<A>__{as the girls slip out, collins turns to carrie, who has backed up and is whimpering. collins slaps her face, not too hard at first, then with a flash of anger.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{m... m... miss collins...}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{stand up. take care of yourself.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i'm bleeding.}
<A>__{one blind searching hand comes up, clutches collins' white shorts, leaving a bloody handprinterior}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{damn you!}
<A>__{she hurls carrie part way across the room toward the broken sanitary napkin dispenser.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{get over there! and take one!}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i don't know...}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{never mind the coin slot... it's broken.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{it hurts... my stomach...}
<C>__{collins}
<P>__{(grabbing her)}
<D>__{do it! now.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i can't. i don't know how!}
<A>__{there's a bright flash as a light bulb poips, fizzling out. collins is surprised.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{what...?}
<A>__{and she looks at carrie. her anger seems to seep away. her voice softens.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{carrie, don't you know...?}
<P>__{(shakes her head, realizing and wondering)}
<D>__{you don't.}
<P>__{(reaches for carrie)}
<D>__{i will show you.}
