<A>__{title: december 1984 todd places a brightly wrapped christmas present on the table in front of dussander, who looks at it skeptically.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{go ahead, open it. wait, i better pull down the shades, first.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{just to be safe.}
<C>__{dussander}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{to hell with this. you open it.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{oh, relax, old man. sit down and open it.}
<A>__{todd opens the refrigerator and pulls out a can of coke. dussander slowly sits back down.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{you wrapped it yourself, i see.}
<A>__{he begins to remove the bow, and then the paper. he moves very cautiously, as if the package might explode at any moment. finally, he removes the lid and his expression shifts from one of fear to one of exasperation.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{merry christmas!}
<A>__{we see that the box contains a replica of an officer's s.s. uniform, complete with hat and jackboots. dussander reads the label.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{pete's quality costume clothiers serving you since 1976.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{go ahead, try it on.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{are you out of your mind, boy? what makes you think i would put something like that on?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i thought you'd like it }
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{like it? my god, you're a bigger fool than i thought. maybe i will put it on and do a little shopping downtown. is that what you thought? you stupid, boy.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{don't call me stupid.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{you... you know, you are correct. i am the stupid one. for months i have suffered your indignities. i have exposed my past to you while watching you stuff your face with those wretched hamburgers. i have stocked my refrigerator with coca cola and ding dongs. all for you, i have done these things and i'm tired of it. but because i value my life and my freedom, what's left of it anyway, i do them. but i will die before i put this thing on, you fucking piss ant.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{that's enough. you don't get to talk to me like that.}
<A>__{dussander bangs the table.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i should smash you.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{do it. please.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{indignities? what you've suffered with me is nothing compared to what the israelis would do to you. remember what happened to eichmann? you forget that, i think. and, you know, that's my fault. i have let you forget. you have gotten comfortable with this situation. well, don't you for one minute ever forget who holds the cards here. don't you ever forget that envelope under my mattress. i tried to do this the nice way, i tried to do something to please you, but you don't want it. so fine, we'll do it the hard way. you will put this on because i want to see you in it. now strip.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i hope you go to hell }
