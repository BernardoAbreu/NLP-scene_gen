<P>__{(somber)}
<D>__{this might be my last chance.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{driving! you care about driving! we could be on everest getting high on ayahuasca with sherpas, and you want to drive!...forget it, i give up. drive.}
<A>__{the two get off the boat and climb into seth's car. adam puts the key in the ignition. without checking the mirrors, he backs the car up. boom the car slams into a giant statue of neptune riding a sea horse.}

<D>__{i know what i'm doing.}
<A>__{adam turns left onto a one way street. it's the wrong way.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{apparently not. you're going the wrong way!}
<A>__{an oncoming car honks and swerves out of the way only nearly avoiding a head on collision.}
<C>__{seth }
<D>__{adam! turn the car around.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{no. i'm driving and i want to go this way.}
<A>__{another car swerves out of the way.}

<D>__{what the fuck is wrong with you?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{for once can you just shut up and let me do this? so i'm driving the wrong way? big fucking deal.}
<A>__{seth pulls the emergency brake. the car stops abruptly.}

<D>__{get! out!}
<A>__{seth looks at adam speechless, and then gets out of the car.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you're being a real douche.}
<A>__{adam locks the doors and sits quietly for a moment. he then proceeds scream at the top of his lungs. 25 years worth of suppressed emotions come out. adam pulls out his cell phone. seth notices. he tries to open the door. it's locked.}
<C>__{seth }
<D>__{adam, open the door.}
<A>__{adam ignores seth and begins to dial.}
<C>__{seth }
<D>__{don't you dare call her. not after everything she's done to you.}
<A>__{adam gives seth the finger.}
<C>__{seth }
<D>__{you're a pussy.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{well you're a selfish piece of shit who cares more about getting his dick wet than actually being a friend.}
<A>__{seth looks hurt. adam holds the phone up to his head.}
