<A>__{on a large viewscreen, bowman can now scan the surface to about a one meter resolution. searches. starts wide, scanning the edge of the horizon as it comes into view. picks up the glint of the mev. zooms in. at first there's nothing but the crashed mev in profile. (like a spy satellite, we are an an extreme angle, slowly revealing more as the ares grows less oblique and tracks overhead.) then the severity of the damage comes clear. bowman tries not to react. nothing else is there. no sign of activity or escape. the footprints are beyond the resolution of the camera. there's no reason to believe anything but they're all dead.}
