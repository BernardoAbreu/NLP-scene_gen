<A>__{james walks out into the nearly deserted parking lot to find two cars parked in front of vaughan's lincoln: a police patrol car and catherine's white sports car. one policeman is inspecting the lincoln, peering through the dusty windows, with vaughan fidgeting beside him. the other stands beside catherine's car, questioning her. james slows guiltily as both policemen begin to talk to vaughan. catherine spots james and walks crisply over to him.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{they're questioning vaughan about an accident near the airport. some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.}
<A>__{as if taking their cue from this, the policemen walk back to their car. vaughan watches them go, head raised like a periscope.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{you'd better drive him. he's a bit shaky. i will follow in my car. where is yours?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{at home. i couldn't face all this traffic.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i'd better come with you, then. are you sure you can drive?}
<A>__{as catherine and james walk toward vaughan, he reaches into the rear seat of his car and pulls out a white sweatshirt. as he takes off his denim jacket, the falling light picks out the scars on his naked abdomen and chest, a constellation of white chips that circle his body from the left armpit down to his crotch.}
