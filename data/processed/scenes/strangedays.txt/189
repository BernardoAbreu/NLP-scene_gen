<A>__{on lenny and mace moving with purpose through the vast steaming factory of the kitchen where a thousand dinners are being prepared. they are ignored by the bustling staff.}

<L>__{interior hotel ballroom}
<A>__{lenny and mace emerge from a service door into the glitterati crowd, heading into the ballroom. they scan the room.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{you see tran?}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{uh unh.}
<A>__{lenny whips out his cellular and recalls max's number. he hears the phone connect. it starts to ring. lenny's pov... as the crowd parts for a moment. he sees palmer strickland talking to a city hall type. lenny turns away before strickland sees him.}
<C>__{lenny}
<P>__{(to the ringing phone)}
<D>__{come on, max. come on, buddy...}
<P>__{(two more rings)}
<D>__{damnit.}
<A>__{he looks around now. starting to feel the creeping edge of panic. no tran. no max.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{alright. we're going up.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{and do what? take on his whole posse?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i still got one ace to play. tran's got what i want... and i've got what he wants...}
<A>__{lenny pulls the jeriko tape out of his breast pocket and holds it up. mace just stares at him completely outraged.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{that's the original. there are no copies.}
<C>__{lenny}
<P>__{(not getting it)}
<D>__{exactly. that's why it's a make able deal.}
<A>__{mace gets very, very close to lenny, and her voice drops to an odd, cold... lethal sounding... growl.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{look. that tape is a lightning bolt from god. it's worth more than you, more than me, more than faith. you understand? it can change things. things that need changing before we all go off the end of the road. and you do not have the right to use it for currency.}
<P>__{(lenny's eyes are wide)}
<D>__{you go... you go alone. this is where i draw the line. i care about you lenny... a lot more than you know... which makes us both pretty stupid. but you pawn that tape, you mean nothing to me.}
<A>__{lenny doesn't know what to say. tough choice. he clenches his jaw... and turns away. he strides into the crowd, heading for the lobby and the elevators. on mace, watching him go. wanting to run and stop him. but she's said what there is to say. she turns away, desolate and churning with emotion. the moment lengthens as she wrestles with it. you see her fury, her sadness... and her protective instincts. her resolve fails her. ultimately, she must protect him if she can.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{ah, hell. lenny }
<A>__{she turns, running toward the lobby. and... boom. slams into him. he came back. lenny takes her hand and puts the tape in her palm. closes her fingers on it.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{see that guy?}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{the one with the ramrod up his ass. that's strickland.}
<A>__{mace follows his look to strickland, across the room.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{take it to him.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{a cop? you want me to trust a cop?!}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{no. trust me.}
<A>__{he unclips his playback deck from his belt and hands it to her.}
<C>__{mace}
<P>__{(nodding slowly)}
<D>__{oh boy.}
<P>__{(she takes a deep breath)}
<D>__{what if you're wrong?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{then we'll be right where we are now.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{yeah, right. fucked.}
