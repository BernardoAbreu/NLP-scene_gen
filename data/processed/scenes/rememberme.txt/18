<D>__{so when would that be available?...no, that's sooner than i'd thought. and is there any kind of deposit?.. okay.}
<A>__{craig comes in through the kitchen door, takes off his jacket and starts washing his hands at the sink.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{i will call you back. thanks.}
<A>__{ally hangs up. makes a quick appraisal of her dad. he has a little blood on his cuff. he splashes his face with water. on automatic pilot, ally flips on the toaster, pours some hot coffee into a sesame street mug, pours in a measured dose of brown sugar from the dispenser, then flips open a bottle of aspirin and deposits two of the tablets into the mug. she packs up her back pack with school stuff as craig gulps his coffee.}

<D>__{what did you tell me you were going to do when things got tight?}
