<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior regis and kathie lee set}
<A>__{rick, regis, and kathie lee are still in silhouette.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{and that's my story.}
<C>__{kathie lee}
<P>__{(yawn)}
<D>__{it was so exciting!}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{and long! my god! it makes war and peace sound like a warm up act!}
<C>__{crew guy}
<D>__{okay! we got light!}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{it's fixed? well, it's about time!}
<A>__{the lights come on no more silhouettes. ricky looks perfectly normal, his old self. his weird silhouette was caused by a potted plant and some strange hanging mobile behind him.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{that's better.}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{i will say.}
<P>__{(to audience)}
<D>__{how 'bout it, folks. let's hear it for ricky coogan!}
<A>__{the audience applauds and hoots wildly.}
<C>__{kathie lee}
<D>__{can we bring out the other freaks now?}
<A>__{the audience cheers as the rest of the freaks walk out from the wings, and stand off to the side waving to the audience. they all look clean cut and happy. they wear t shirts with their former identities printed on them. "i was nosey," "i was cowboy," "i was the bearded lady" etc. except the worm, who's still a worm. his t shirt says, "i'm still the worm".}
<C>__{worm}
<D>__{ridiculous... just because a man doesn't like macaroons... nonsense.}
<A>__{suddenly a squirrel runs across stage, followed by juan. he pounces and catches the furry little bugger.}
<C>__{juan}
<D>__{gotcha! damn, it's about time! all the ex freaks}
<P>__{(happy to see him)}
<D>__{juan!}
<C>__{juan}
<D>__{hey guys! jeez! you look great!}
<A>__{they all hug.}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{that's just great. what a story. and what an ending! elijah transformed by the goop!}
<C>__{kathie lee}
<D>__{and he really looked like ?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{exactly like you two, i swear. same faces, same outfits, except they had these really big, hideous feet...}
<A>__{he looks down at regis and kathie lee's feet they're big, hideous monster feet! suddenly their eyes glow bright red it's elijus and elly lee! they speak with elijah's voice.}
<C>__{elijus}
<D>__{show's over, ricky!}
<C>__{elly lee}
<D>__{i'm gonna drink your blood!}
<A>__{elly lee pulls a machete and is about to force it down on rick's throat when... bang! bang! bang! elijus and elly lee's eyes go funny. they look at each other, spit up some blood, wave to the audience one last time, and collapse to the floor. julie stands behind them, smoking gun in hand. she rushes to rick. they embrace.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{rick! it's finally over!}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{yes... yes it is.}
<C>__{stuey}
<D>__{rick! rick!}
<A>__{rick and julie turn and see stuey, still a ten foot tall monster, running towards them. he's carrying a garbage bag dripping blood.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{stuey!}
<C>__{stuey}
<D>__{look! i found the real regis and kathie lee!}
<A>__{rick and julie look at the bag, mortified. stuey chuckles.}
<C>__{stuey }
<D>__{no, this is just my lunch!}
<A>__{rick and julie sigh with relief. stuey pulls out a similar leaking bag and holds it up.}
<C>__{stuey}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{this is regis and kathie lee.}
<A>__{rick and julie nod casually "oh."}
<C>__{audience}
<D>__{awwww!}
<A>__{suddenly elijus and elly lee pop up from behind the couch, bloodied, but still fierce. they're about to stab rick and julie when... bang! bang! bang! bang! bang! five more shots ring out and they fall dead again. ernie stands off to the side with a smoking gun.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{oh, like that wasn't totally predictable.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{well, now it really is over.}
<A>__{sappy end of the movie music wells up.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{thank god. you know, this adventure has taught me something.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{when man starts impinging on the subtle perfection of the earth's natural order, the only thing he'll create is havoc.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{right, coog. i learned somethin' too. that men and women truly are equals. that the human spirit transcends gender and physical appearance, and thus it is immune to the petty degradations men may devise. i believe it was moliere who said }
<A>__{julie's had enough. she socks ernie square on the jaw.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{oh, shut up.}
<P>__{(she turns to rick)}
<D>__{let's go fuck.}
<A>__{rick gives her the thumbs up. they turn to the audience.}
<D>__{rick julie ernie stuey monster good night, everybody!}
<A>__{the audience cheers. the hit single from the soundtrack album kicks in as we...}
<C>__{roll credits}
<A>__{as the credits roll, and everybody continues to smile and wave at the cheering audience, elijus and elly lee attack again. ernie hands the gun to stuey, who shoots them dead. well, dead ish. seconds later, after some more waving, they attack again. this time nosey and the bearded lady stab them to death, sort of. a little more waving, before elijus and elly lee make another pathetic attempt. they can barely stand. cowboy clubs one with a mic stand. worm head butts the other. a few seconds later, elijus's bloodied hand gropes its way over the top of the studio couch. stuey has to prop him up while members of the audience are invited down to punch him in the chops. ernie stands off to the side, charging everyone five bucks per blow. as we fade, everyone's having a go flipping, throwing, kicking and impaling rag doll replicas of america's favorite morning show hosts.}
<D>__{the end?!}
