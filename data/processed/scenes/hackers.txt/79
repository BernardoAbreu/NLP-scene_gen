<A>__{weird music plays, lots of weird people dance. razor and blade are on stage, dancing in front of a huge speaker.}

<D>__{there they are!}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{razor and blade! they're flakes!}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{they're elite! let's get 'em.}
<A>__{dade and kate push through the crowd. the song changes to a fast industrial rap number, razor and blade leave the stage, and dade starts getting moshed. he climbs on the stage to follow razor and blade. for his trouble, he is thrown back onto the crowd, who pass him around overhead. finally the crowd lets him go. he catches up with kate.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i lost 'em. where were you?}
<A>__{dade tries to explain, but is at a loss for words. they make their way to the entrance to razor and blade's lair. video monitors are everywhere.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{i don't like this.}
<A>__{a robotic arm with a revolver swings around to point at dade.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{aaaaaugh! i definitely don't like this!}
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(through video intercom)}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{ummm... we come in peace?}
<A>__{dade winces at his own corniness.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{we need your help. if you're up to it.}
<C>__{razor}
<D>__{she's buff. ballsy.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{let's keep her.}
<C>__{razor}
<D>__{waste the dude.}
<A>__{the gun goes off. it's only a cigarette lighter! no one can accuse razor and blade of not having a sense of humor.}
