<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{on the sandy lot that extends back from the trailer is a wizened cottonwood tree. katherine, thomas, and mary are seated beneath its shade. katherine is protective of the little girl, running a hand maternally through her hair.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{how are you feeling, pumpkin?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{better.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{this is mr. dagget, mary. he'd like to ask you some questions. you don't have to answer if you don't want to.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<A>__{there's a dreamy, far away look in mary's eyes. it worries katherine.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{mary, when you talked to man up in the building }
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{ simon.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{yes, simon. what did simon say?}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{that's funny. "simon says".}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{right. like the game.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i'm good at it. i'm very clever.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{we'll have to play together sometime.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{simon even said so. he also asked if i could keep a secret.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{and what was that?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{something he gave me.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{what, pumpkin?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{then it wouldn't be a secret.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{you're a good friend not to tell, mary. but i'm a friend of simon's too. so if you ever want to tell, you can to me. okay?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{it's a secret...}
<A>__{mary lowers her head and shuts her eyes.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{...but sometimes it hurts.}
<A>__{thomas and katherine exchange looks. mary's pretty eyes rise again as she calmly asks, in that cute little eight year old voice:}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{have you ever killed a chinaman?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{no mary, i haven't.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{they don't bleed. not the way you and i do. or maybe it was just the cold...}
<A>__{thomas looks to katherine for an explanation, but she's as confused as him.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i've killed them, you know. lots. you could always tell when they were coming. there'd be the trumpets first. every note flat. then those songs... after that they'd charge. right down through the snow. the guns would freeze and it would be just knives... it was so cold and there were so many of them. but i was smarter than they were. even at chosin, i was smarter...}
<A>__{mary's been explaining this in a girlish, show 'n tell kind of way. suddenly her face cracks as her voice chokes with a sob.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{it scares me, miss henley. i hate it. please, make it stop!}
<A>__{she buries herself into katherine's arms, sobbing.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{make it stop!}
<C>__{katherine}
<P>__{(rocking her)}
<D>__{it's okay... it's okay...}
<A>__{mary suddenly pushes away and runs back toward the trailer, into the arms of her grandmother.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i didn't mean to }
<C>__{grandmother}
<D>__{it's all right, miss henley. we know you love mary...}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{what are we going to do?}
<C>__{grandmother}
<D>__{she's going to have the enemy ghost way. we leave this afternoon.}
<A>__{the grandmother turns and walks back to the trailer.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{where will they do the ceremony?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{in the home village. the hand trembler must have found corpse sickness...}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{they're taking her away? shouldn't she see a doctor?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{she's already seen a doctor.}
<P>__{(then, under her breath)}
<D>__{that son of a bitch...}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{gabriel the children called him. the little shit was hanging around my kids this morning asking about mary. he and his buddy make a real pair.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{maybe it's time i checked out mr. gabriel.}
<A>__{katherine turns from trailer and looks at him.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{i know where he parks his car.}
