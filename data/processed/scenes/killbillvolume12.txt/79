<L>__{interior japanese restaurant night}
<A>__{the white paper door to o ren's dining room slams open. yuki and go go step into the corridor. all trace of the bride has vanished. they look out over the restaurant, patrons look normal. whoever was there is gone now. go go removes the small dagger from the wood post and the yubari sisters go back into the private dining room, slamming the door behind them.}
<B>__{one shot}
<A>__{cu the bride at the bar, in her kimono, drinking a colorful cocktail. she observes all the activity by o ren's private dining room. when the yubari sisters go back inside, the bride climbs off her barstool and goes through the restaurant...into the parking area...and up to her rental car. she opens the door. takes off her japanese kimono, underneath is a one piece yellow track suit with a black stripe going down both sides, like the one bruce lee wears in "game of death." she tosses the kimono in the trunk, then removes the sheathed hanzo sword. with the sword of vengeance in her hand, we follow her back inside the restaurant. she looks upstairs to the o ren dining room. we see yuki yubari and sofie fatale, slide open the door, and walk down the stairs together. when they get to the bottom, they give each other a kiss goodbye, and yuki leaves the restaurant, while sofie makes her way to the bathroom...only to have the bride, now dressed in her bruce lee yellow outfit and samurai sword in her hand, bar her way.}
