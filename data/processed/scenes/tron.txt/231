<L>__{interior mcp}
<A>__{sark is much bigger than before, advancing on tron. he speaks, but his voice is that of the mcp.}
<D>__{sark mcp end of line, program...}
<A>__{we can see the mcp in the b.g. suddenly there is an explosion of static, as flynn falls into the mcp. we see a weird 2 d image of flynn's face circling in the cylinder with the mcp as they battle. sark falters, stumbles, distracted by this, and tron ducks under him and hurls the code disk for the last time. it circles the mcp once, and then hurtles straight for the target, the apex of the energy cones. and connects.}
<B>__{shot of the apex}
<A>__{a brilliant explosion of lights bursts out.}
<B>__{shot of sark}
<A>__{dead face wracked with the pain of a second death. he begins to melt into a column of pure energy, dissipating completely.}
<B>__{shot of the mcp}
<A>__{we see something materializing in the apex of the energy cones. it is dressed like dumont was at the i 0 tower, an old man in the padded altar costume, spinning, slowly, finally stopping. we see the wizened, wrinkled face of the true mcp for just a few seconds, and see that he is furiosly typing on an old remington portable. then he too dissolves into liquid energy, and disappears. the cylinder of the mcp glows brighter and brighter.}
<B>__{yori and the bit}
<A>__{on the bridge of the carrier looking down at this.}
<B>__{her pov}
<A>__{a fountain of energy explodes upwards like a supernova, right at the camera.}
<B>__{yori}
<A>__{shielding her face from the power of the blast.}
<B>__{long shot}
<A>__{the nova of energy bursting upwards. we start to see the glow returning to the surrounding domains, as the nova dissipates, leaving the sky full of sparkling stars.}
<B>__{yori}
<A>__{still shielding her eyes, but looking out in wonder at the domains regaining their life.}
<B>__{her pov}
<A>__{one domain after another, scattered around the horizon, glows brightly, increasing.}
<B>__{long shot}
<A>__{the carrier starts to descend.}
