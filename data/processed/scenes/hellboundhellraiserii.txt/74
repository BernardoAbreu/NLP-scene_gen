<A>__{the room is much as we saw it last. the window slides up and kyle pulls himself into the room. he looks around it carefully. sure that the monster he saw the previous night is no longer in the room, he helps kirsty in through the window. kirsty's eyes go at once to the three lament configurations in the glass cases. she crosses the room eagerly. kyle rushes after her and stops her opening one of the cases.}
