<A>__{cameron, sprawled on the road, is momentarily paralyzed at the sight of the duesenberg's great brass grill bearing down. his hand closes over a rock and with the same illogical gesture that a soldier flings a coke bottle at a tank, cameron hurls the rock in the direction of the car and frantically rolls sideways. the big spinning tires brush him as they pass. we catch a momentary glimpse of the rock smashing against the gleam of the passing windshield. as he stops rolling, once more face down in the dust, eyes closed, expecting death, he becomes aware there is only silence. he opens his eyes, climbs to his feet. the road is empty. the duesenberg is gone. astonished, confused he walks to the side of the bridge where the railing ends and the car might have plunged off. there is nothing below but the rushing black water. here and there bubbles swirl to the surface. they could be from a sinking car or could be caused by the current.}
