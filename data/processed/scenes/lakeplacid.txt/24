<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior indigo maine day}
<A>__{it's a small, almost tiny town; general store, post office, fire station. kelly and keough are in front of the general store loading supplies into a van, across the street in front of the sheriff's department.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{nobody lives within twenty five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake. teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you talk to the married couple?}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{not yet.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what kind of backup do we have?}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{we?}
<A>__{that strikes a nerve.}
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{sorry. i'm just a little unclear as to why the museum of natural history would send somebody here.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you have a thing against museums?}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{i got nothing against }
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{ever even been in one?}
<A>__{he stares back. then picks up a huge cannon like gun. as he loads it }
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{lightweight forward area air device unit. whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.}
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{and you stock these things for what, to fend off russia?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{you're sort of a rude person.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{it's just that }
<A>__{suddenly, like a shot, kelly's arm jerks up as she jet sprays a white fog from a can of yard guard. keough holds a look at her.}
<C>__{kelly }
<D>__{mosquitos. i have a thing about mosquitos.}
<A>__{upon which a sport utility vehicle pulls up, it's marked "maine fish and game". jack wells emerges, kelly's eyes scan him like radar.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we set?}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{ready.}
<P>__{(re kelly; dry)}
<D>__{a museum in new york sent us some additional back up.}
<A>__{kelly shoots keough a look. then:}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{kelly scott.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{jack wells. a museum sent you?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{are we all museum bigots in maine?}
<A>__{jack holds a look, decides to let that pass.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{did you make anything of the tooth?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{yes, it did seem prehistoric but i'm sure he just carried the thing for luck. not that it worked, obviously. it probably somehow got lodged into his body.}
<A>__{jack holds another look.}
<C>__{kelly }
<D>__{why are you staring at me?}
<P>__{(to keough)}
<D>__{do i have a smudge on my face, it would be so you not to have told me.}
<A>__{keough also lets that pass.}
<C>__{keough}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{i'm ready when you are.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{as they start out, kelly grabs jack by the arm.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{excuse me. one other thing, it's a small point, but... i have a thing about being humored, and i'm feeling humored, more by him, but you seemed quick to join in.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.}
<A>__{as janine post, sixteen, flirtatious little vixen, steps up.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{excuse me? is it true you're going to look for some kind of monster in black lake?}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{we're just going to investigate an accident. there's no monster.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{we heard a man got bit in half.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{there was an accident, that's all. nothing to worry about.}
<A>__{and janine goes into the store. the men just watch her go. sixteen going on twenty, nubile. kelly just looks at the men, gaping at the girl.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{please.}
