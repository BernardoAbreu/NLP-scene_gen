<D>__{can i be of service to you?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i didn't know you were . . . why are you leaving?}
<C>__{vronsky}
<D>__{you know why. i have to be where you are. i can't not.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{this is wrong. if you're a good man, forget everything that happened, as i will.}
<C>__{vronsky}
<D>__{i will never forget a single thing about you, not a word, not a gesture }
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{that's enough!}
<A>__{she climbs the steps on to the porch. at the door to the carriage she pauses. the encounter has left her feeling elated and frightened.}
