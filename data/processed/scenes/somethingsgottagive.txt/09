<B>__{harry and marin}
<A>__{walking past shops on the main drag in east hampton. they are both licking ice cream cones. camera stays behind them.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{he's obviously a penis substitute.}
<B>__{erica and zoe}
<A>__{are paced 20 feet behind them, carrying groceries.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i mean a father substitute.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{except he's older than her father. i can't even look at them. what is she doing with a guy that age?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{marin was how old when you guys broke up?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{five years ago, so. ..twenty three.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{okay, so she was old enough not to feel dave was walking out on her.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{is that supposed to mean dave walked out on me? why do people assume when you break up after twenty years that the guy's the one who wanted out? just because once we broke up he shtupped everything that moved...}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{easy cowgirl. i didn't mean it that way. just trying to figure out why such a smart girl is always with the wrong guy.}
<B>__{close on a young french girl in an apron}
<C>__{young french girl}
<D>__{mme. barry, que je puis vous obtenir aujourd'hui?}
<A>__{the girl stands behind the cheese counter in:}
<B>__{the barefoot contessa}
<A>__{a gourmet market in east hampton. the clientele in here is as rich looking as the food. erica stands on the other side of the cheese counter.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{bonjour je veux une partie de votre pate merveilleux et de votre meilleur fromage absolu de chevre.}
<A>__{harry and marin shop near by. harry listens to erica out of one ear.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that's impressive.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{she started french lessons after she and my dad split up. part of her "keep busy, don't look back" program. she's practically fluent now.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(turning back to marin)}
<D>__{marin, au cas ou nous prende un desset ou devrions jefaire quelgue chose?}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(with an impeccable accent)}
<D>__{laissons quelque chose d'achat. et ce grand gateau de chocolat?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{hey, not bad.. .}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{yeah...well. ..i am fluent. be right back.}
<A>__{marin crosses to the dessert counter. erica turns back and catches harry checking out marin's ass. he smiles as he licks his ice cream. erica rolls her eyes then spots another older guy with a leggy girl twenty five years his junior.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{it's an epidemic.}
<A>__{then erica notices who's next to her at the cheese counter. she sees her sister, zoe, reading a cheese label with her glasses on and next to zoe are two sad looking old women in their eighties with their arms linked. almost woozy, erica is snapped out of it when she is handed her package.}
<C>__{young french girl}
<D>__{merci madame.}
<A>__{erica heads down the aisle, passing harry whose back is to her. just as she passes, he turns and almost bumps into her.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(backing off)}
<D>__{woops. sorry.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{my fault.}
<A>__{they so very badly do not want to actually touch. erica hesitates. harry gestures for her to go first then walks alongside her.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{so, harry... what do you do?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm one of the owners of a record company among other things...}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{oh, really? which record company?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{drive by records.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(appalled at the name)}
<D>__{"drive by" records??? is that a joke? what is that?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it's a hip hop label.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{hip hop? oh, rap? oh, right. well.}
<P>__{(with disdain)}
<D>__{okay. that's... "interesting"...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{let me see if i get where you're headed here. . .}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but, look, you know i hate rap, i mean i do. it's sort of violent and crude for my taste, not to mention just a tad misogynistic.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{hey, a lot of people see rapping as poetry.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{yeah, but come on, how many words can you rhyme with 'bitch'?}
<A>__{erica places her groceries on the check out counter.}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(joining harry)}
