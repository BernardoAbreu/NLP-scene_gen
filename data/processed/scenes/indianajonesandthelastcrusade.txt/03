<L>__{interior the passageway day}
<A>__{the two boys head down the passageway. it's dark, and the temperature drops several degrees. spiders have built huge webs that get caught in the boys' hair. herman appears very uncertain as to the wisdom of this enterprise, but he's drawn on by his companion's adventurous curiosity.}
<C>__{herman}
<D>__{i don't think this is such a good idea.}
<A>__{laughter is heard; the blond scout pulls herman forward toward its source. the voices grow louder now as the boys get closer to their source. the light of kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel walls ahead. the boys approach cautiously, careful to stay hidden.}
<C>__{herman}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{this is what they see: four men digging with shovels and pick axes. they have broken into one of the pueblo's secret chambers... called "kivas." the men are rough rider (his name describes his dress), roscoe (a bowery boy bully of 14) and halfbreed (with straight black hair that cascades over his shoulders). and the fourth man wears a leather waist jacket and brown felt fedora hat. he has his back turned to us, but we would be willing to bet anything that this is indlana jones. however, when the man turns, and his face is illuminated by the lantern's glow, we are shocked to discover that it is someone else. we'll call him fedora.}
<B>__{titles end.}
<A>__{the two boys are mesmerized by what they see. now we realize that the blond scout is actually young indiana jones.}
<C>__{fedora}
<D>__{alfred, did you get anything yet?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{nothing. dig in.}
<A>__{two of the men stand and look at roscoe who steps forward holding a box in his hands.}
<C>__{roscoe}
<D>__{hey, i've got something!}
<A>__{whoops from the other men.}
<C>__{roscoe}
<D>__{i got something, garth!}
<A>__{roscoe rushes forward and gives fedora the box. fedora steps toward a lantern resting on a rock.}
<C>__{roscoe}
<D>__{i got something... i got something right here.}
<A>__{more whoops from the other men. fedora puts the box on the rock next to the lantern. halfbreed pushes roscoe as he jumps with excitement. rough rider steps forward to look at the box as fedora opens it.}
<C>__{roscoe}
<P>__{(more whoops; then)}
<D>__{oh, look at thatl}
<P>__{(more whoops)}
<D>__{we're richl we're rich!}
<C>__{halfbreed}
<D>__{shut up. shut up.}
<A>__{fedora takes a bejeweled cross from the box and holds it aloft. fedora's comrades practically salivate at the sight of it.}
<C>__{roscoe }
<D>__{well, we're rich, ain't we?l}
<A>__{indy takes off his hat and looks down at the o.s. action.}
<C>__{herman}
<D>__{indy? indy? what are they doing? indiana? indiana?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{shhhl}
<A>__{fedora blows dust from the cross, turning it in his hand, silently appraising its beauty... and its value. he seems aloof from the others; somehow superior to them.}
<C>__{halfbreed}
<D>__{hey, we got to find more stuff to bring back.}
<A>__{indy stays hidden, but is astounded by what he sees.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(hushed; urgent)}
<D>__{it's the cross of coronadol cortes gave it to him in 15201}
<A>__{fedora continues to admire the cross, then places it on the rock next to its box and the lantern. indy turns back to observe the men.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{that cross is an important artifact. it belongs in a museum.}
<A>__{a look of resolve comes into indy's expression, and he turns back toward}
<B>__{herman.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{run back and find the others. tell mister havelock that there are men looting in the caves.}
<A>__{herman doesn't seem to be listening. instead, he watches in wide eyed horror as a snake slithers across his lap.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{have him bring the sheriff.}
<A>__{indy matter of factly picks up the snake and tosses it aside. herman gasps.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{it's only a snake.}
<A>__{indy grabs herman's scout scarf and pulls him closer.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{did you hear what i said?}
<C>__{herman}
<D>__{right. run back. mister havelock. the sheriff. what, what are you gonna do?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i don't know... i will think of something.}
<A>__{indy releases the scarf, gives herman a pat and herman dashes off. indy sees the cross on the rock next to the lantern. as the robbers continue to search for additional valuables, indy is able to work his way unseen to within arm's reach of the cross... fedora looks over at the men digging in a hole b.g.}
<C>__{fedora}
<D>__{dig with your hands.}
<A>__{indy picks up the cross.}
<C>__{fedora }
<D>__{not with your mouth.}
<A>__{as fedora stands watching the other men digging, indy puts the cross in his pants and begins to pull himself up a rope hanging nearby. as he climbs, indy's feet break a wooden beam, attracting the men's attention.}
<C>__{roscoe}
<D>__{he's got our thing!}
<C>__{halfbreed}
<D>__{get 'im!}
<A>__{the three robbers are so eager to get their hands on indy, they almost knock each other over in the attempt. only fedora is unperturbed. he casts a disgusted glance in the direction of his fleeing companionsthen sets off after indy.}
