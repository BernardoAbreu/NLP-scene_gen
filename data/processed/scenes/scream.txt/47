<A>__{sidney, puts her head down, hiding her face...avoiding other reporters as she makes her way to... gale who sits in the open door, checking her face in a mirror. makeup tries hard to hide sid's handwork a swollen black and blue right cheek. gale spots sidney immediately and leaps to her feet.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{stop right there.}
<A>__{sidney throws her hands up in surrender.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i'm not here to fight.}
<C>__{gale}

<D>__{i want to talk to you.}
<C>__{gale}
<P>__{(calling into the van)}
<D>__{kenny. camera. now.}
<A>__{kenny's head darts out from the van.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{off the record. no cameras.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{forget it.}
<A>__{sidney contains herself.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{please. you owe me.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{i owe you shit.}
<A>__{gale moves inside the van. but sidney is relentless.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you owe my mother.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. somebody was gonna write a book about it.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{and it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{what is your problem? you got what you wanted. cotton weary is in jail. they're gonna gas him. a book is not gonna change that.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{do you still think he's innocent?}
<A>__{gale's interest is peaked. she eyes sidney suspiciously.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{he was convicted in a court of law. your testimony put him away. it doesn't matter what i think.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{during the trial, you did all those stories about me. you called me a liar.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{i think you falsely identified him. yes.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{have you talked to cotton?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{many times.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{has his story changed?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{not one word. he admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{he's lying. she wouldn't have touched him. he raped her, then butchered her. her blood was all over his coat.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{he was drunk that night. he left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i saw him leaving wearing it.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{but couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? the same person who planted it in cotton's car, framing him? the same person who really killed your mother?}
<A>__{a long beat. sidney considers this for the millionth time.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{no, cotton murdered my mother.}
<A>__{but there's doubt in her voice. gale's face lights up.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{you're not so sure anymore, are you?}
<A>__{sidney clams up.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{no, it was cotton.}
<A>__{tatum comes waltzing up.}
<C>__{tatum}
<P>__{(to gale)}
<D>__{nice welt.}
<A>__{gale ignores her, zeroing in on sidney, half realizing.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{the killer is still on the loose, isn't he? these murders are related.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{yo let's rock.}
<A>__{sidney starts to fidget.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i'm sorry i mangled your face.}
<A>__{she take off with tatum. gale calls after her.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{wait, sidney, don't go...}
<A>__{but sidney and tatum have already disappeared in the crowd of students moving across campus. gale looks to kenny.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{jesus christ! an innocent man on death row. a killer still on the loose. kenny, tell me i'm dreaming.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{you want to go live?}
<A>__{gale's mind races with possibilities.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{no, not so fast. we have nothing concrete.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{when did that ever stop you? you can't sit on this. this is huge.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{if i'm gonna blow this up i need hard proof.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{but it's so much easier when we make it up.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{not this time. i owe cotton that much. hell, even i thought that man was guilty.}
