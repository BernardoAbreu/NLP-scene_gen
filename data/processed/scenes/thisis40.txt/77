<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{that is not nice.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{so, then sadie said, "don't call me a bitch." and joseph said, "i didn't call you a bitch, i said don't act like a bitch. and by the way you're in the `not hot' column."}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{who made him the judge of hot?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{do you realize what that could do to her self esteem?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{what a little fuckhead. i will kill him.}

<D>__{so then sadie said, "you're in the jackass column. i've got to go. i'm bored of you."}

<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i don't think it means anything, i think it's just adorable.}

<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{if she caught us, she would kill us.}
<A>__{debbie starts looking through the ipad. pete's iphone chimes. he sees a message from ronnie from work. it reads: "got the numbers. call me." pete looks ashen. he looks over at debbie who is oblivious.}
