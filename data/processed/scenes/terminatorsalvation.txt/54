<L>__{exterior trees evening}
<A>__{marcus moves past the trunks of bare trees, pauses, looks over the water in the direction the transport took.}
<C>__{blair }
<D>__{yo! up here!}
<A>__{blair williams, the helmeted pilot who ejected, hangs from the tangled remains of her parachute, caught in the trees about fifteen feet in the air above marcus. marcus moves closer. blair struggles to saw through her lines with a knife.}
<C>__{blair }
<D>__{who are you }
<A>__{the lines suddenly snap, blair falls from the tree. marcus' reflexes are fast as ever, he's beneath her in an instant and catches her. he holds her in his arms:}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{name's marcus.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{you can put me down now, marcus.}
<A>__{he does so. blair pulls off her helmet, her hair is short. she's in her 20s, pretty, petite but strong, a no nonsense, battle hardened member of the resistance. she pulls a compass from her flight suit, consults it briefly as she orients herself.}
<C>__{blair }
<D>__{i've got an elt, but i can't call for a rescue here. there's an outpost a few miles upriver not my favorite people in the world, but it's safe. let's move.}
<A>__{blair is already moving, marcus hesitates, then points across the water.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i'm heading that way.}
<C>__{blair}
<P>__{(a short laugh)}
<D>__{the hot zone? no you're not.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i've got to get to my friends }
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{what friends?}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{couple of kids. they were in that flying dumpster }
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{the skynet transport? it was carrying people?}
<P>__{(off his nod)}
<D>__{christ, we almost shot it down. there've been rumors about a concentration camp, but...}
<A>__{she shakes her head, gestures toward the river.}
<C>__{blair }
<D>__{you can't get across river's fulla hydrobots }
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{hydrobots?}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{they can't see, but they have killer sonar. they'll attack anything that moves or makes a sound. even if you get past them, you'd be dead before you covered a hundred yards. if the terminators don't get you, the fallout will heavy rads all the way to the gulf coast, nothing can live there.}
<A>__{marcus absorbs this, starts walking with her.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you're with the resistance.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{lt. blair williams, i fly for what used to be the air national guard.}
<A>__{she puts a hand out, listening. she signals for him to lay low, behind a fallen tree. nearby a pair of t 1s on patrol rumble into view. they pause, scanning the area, chain guns at the ready. they start to move toward blair and marcus' hiding place. blair quickly grabs a stone and, staying down, hurls it as far away as she can the stone strikes a few branches the t 1s suddenly turn in that direction, guns blazing the woods in the immediate vicinity are torn to pieces by the gunfire, small fires erupt from the incendiary bullets it's definitely overkill. the t 1s roll over to inspect the damage, out of view. blair whispers:}
<C>__{blair }
<D>__{stupid bastards. come on.}
<A>__{she and marcus move away quickly, away from the trees. when they're a safe distance from the robots }
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i don't know... this has gotta be some kind of, like, dream or hallucination. like what happens to people right before they die...}
<A>__{blair slugs him hard, in the arm. he doesn't flinch, but he looks surprised.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{that snap you out of it?}
<A>__{marcus shakes his head. they keep walking.}
<C>__{blair }
<D>__{well hell, maybe you are dreaming. do us all a favor and wake up already.}
