<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{thirty one?}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{mr. reid, we're not getting any younger...}

<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{mrs. cole may i call you virginia?}
<C>__{virginia}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{but that would be a lie, wouldn't it?}

<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{isn't your true name...}
<P>__{(brandishing passport)}
<D>__{carlotta?!}
<C>__{virginia}
<D>__{well, yes. but it wasn't me so i started using virginia. is there anything wrong with that?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{not really. it's just the first and smallest in the tissue of lies that is the kleenex of your life. let's take one simple document as a sample of your veracity, shall we, carlotta?}
<A>__{he grabs her purse from the desk, rifles through it,}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{your driver's license. what color are your eyes?}
<C>__{virginia}
<D>__{blue.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{true blue? what if i asked you to remove your contact lenses? what color would they be then?}
<C>__{virginia}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}
<D>__{brown.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{and here it says you're a blonde . are you?}
<P>__{(off her silence)}
<D>__{c'mon, carlotta, there's a very easy way for us to check. if you don't remember, perhaps mr. falk will.}
<C>__{virginia}
<D>__{brunette.}
<C>__{fletch er}
<D>__{more like a dirty brown, isn't it?}
<P>__{(she nods)}
<D>__{let's see. " weight: one o five"? please...}
<C>__{virginia}
<D>__{one eighteen.}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{one twenty six. i swear!}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{so on this single document, you basically lied at every opportunity. i'm sure a woman as vain as you would also lie about her age. it says you were born in 1964. what's the truth? 1962? '60? how young did you try to make yourself?}
<C>__{virginia}
<P>__{(joyfully)}
<D>__{wrong! i didn't lie to make myself younger. i made myself older. i was born in 1965!"}
<C>__{fletcher}
<P>__{(feigning surprise)}
<D>__{what? you're trying to tell us you lied to make yourself older?}
<C>__{virginia}
<D>__{yes! " lied so i could get married! so there mister 'i got all the answers because i went to law school'!}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{mr. reid, does this have a point?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{oh, you bet it does, your honor!}
<P>__{(on a roll)}
<D>__{my client lied about her age because she was only 17 when she got married. which makes her a minor. and in the great state of california, no minor can enter into a legal contract without parental consent including }
<C>__{dana}
<P>__{(defeated, to herself)}
<D>__{prenuptual agreements.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<P>__{(knows he has them)}
<D>__{prenuptual agreements! thank you very little! this contract is void!!! the fact that my client gets nailed more often than a two by four is irrelevant. standard community property applies and this woman is entitled to half of the marital assets or thirty seven point three nine five million dollars!!}
<P>__{(to dana)}
<D>__{you . . . . are . . . . toasttttt!! !}
<P>__{(dramatically)}
<D>__{nothing further, your honor!}
<A>__{a murmur overtakes the room!}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<P>__{(banging his gavel)}
<D>__{quiet! let me see the license and birth certificate.}
<A>__{all is quiet while the judge reviews the documents. then:}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{in light of this new evidence, the court must rule in favor of the defense. mrs. cole is hereby awarded half of the marital assets or thirtyrseven million three hundred and ninety five thousand dollars.}
<A>__{the courtroom erupts. fletcher's won! dana, mr. cole are devastated.}
<C>__{mr. allan}
<D>__{that son of bitch pulled it off!}
<A>__{mr. allan gives fletcher a thumbs up; simultaneously, miranda gives him the finger.}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{order ! order!! now i understand both parties have agreed to joint custody. is that correct?}
<C>__{fletcher and dana}
<D>__{yes }
<C>__{virginia}
<D>__{no! i'm contesting custody.}
<A>__{fletcher freezes.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{virginia}
<P>__{(re: her husband)}
<D>__{payback. for him trying to prevent me from collecting my thirty seven million.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{he was entitled to prevent you. you committed adultery. you only won because you're a liar, remember?}
<C>__{virginia}
<D>__{no. you pointed out that my husband took advantage of a poor underage girl. i was the victim here. and now i'm going to hit him where it hurts.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{but but you said he was a good father.}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{mr. reid? do we have an agreement on custody or not?}
<A>__{fletcher takes a distressed look at the children.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{in that case, there will be a custody hearing tomorrow mor ning at nine. court is adjourned!}
<A>__{he bangs the gavel. everyone gets up, but fletcher's attention is drawn to a commotion between virginia and her kids.}
<C>__{virginia}
<D>__{stop that! we're leaving now!}
<C>__{child}
<D>__{i want to go with daddy.}
<A>__{fletcher watches, horrified, as she drags the kids away from their tearful father.}
<C>__{mr. cole}
<D>__{don't worry. i will see you no matter what. i promise.}
<A>__{mr. allan has made his way up to fletcher.}
<C>__{mr. allan}
<P>__{(re: the commotion)}
<D>__{i love kids. they give you so much leverage in a case like this.}
<P>__{(pats fletcher on back)}
<D>__{congratulations, partner. how does it feel?}
<A>__{and with that question asked, as he watches poor mr. cole and his kids, the truth dawns on fletcher like a sledgehammer!}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{excuse me. just a second.}
<P>__{(to the judge)}
<D>__{your honor? your honor? wait!}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{we're adjourned, mr. reid.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{screw that!! she lies and she wins ?! what are we, nuts?}
<A>__{everyone stops, watches fletcher.}
<C>__{fletcher }
<D>__{this woman my client goes down with the frequency of a nuclear submarine and we just gave her thirty seven million dollars because she's a liar! and now as an extra added little bonus, we're going to let her steal, the kids, too?}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{mr. reid, you are out of order!}
<C>__{fletcher}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{so's the hand dryer in the men's room!! do you ever stop to ask yourself, why do people hate us? could it be because what we did here today sucks?! we don't care about the truth! we don't want to find the truth ! we want to win! we want to win at all costs...and you know what the worst thing about wanting to win so badly is ? winning! winning and finding out you're left with nothing!}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{that's enough, mr. reid }
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{let' s see what i' ve done today. i've helped a gold digging slut get richer. i'm taking this guy's kids away.}
<P>__{(to mr. allan)}
<D>__{i don't like you in the least, now i'm one of your partners! you wanna know what it feels like mr. allan? it feels like shit! but to tell you it feels like shit, feels fucking great!!}
<A>__{fletcher does feel strangely fantastic. free,}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{that's it, mr..reid. i find you in contempt!}
