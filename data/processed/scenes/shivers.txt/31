<L>__{interior betts' apartment night}
<A>__{janine enters betts' apartment. betts is sitting cross legged in leotards on the broadloom, a number of very large black and white photographs spread out in front of her. as she speaks to janine, she arranges and rearranges them. other equipment and graphics of various kinds stuck on walls, hidden in corners and lying on chairs and tables suggest that betts is in advertising and commercial graphics. janine stands halfway in the door.}

<D>__{i've ordered in some vrai cuisine francaise from jean phillipe at the cote d'azur restaurant. escargots in garlic butter... the works. they have lovely strong delivery boys who fight their way through sleet and hail and the gloom of night just to bring me my coq au vin. and after dr. st. luc has told you that there's nothing wrong with nick that a vacation won't cure, and if nick falls asleep early again, you just come on back here for company and a late supper. you hear me?}
<A>__{janine nods.}
<C>__{betts}
<D>__{now, i mean it. i always order enough for two and i will just get fat and lonely if you don't show up.}
<A>__{janine wiggles her fingers goodbye and leaves.}
