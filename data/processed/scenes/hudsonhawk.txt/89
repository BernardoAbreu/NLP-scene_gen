<L>__{interior the da vinci workshop}
<A>__{alfred leads them through the da vinci workshop past the bat winged glider and incongruously crammed in tennis ball machine.}
<L>__{interior the room of the gold machine day}
<A>__{alfred grandly opens double doors to reveal that da vinci's gold machine has been majestically re created piece by piece. in the periphery, the 90's rears its head in the form of three technicians wearing headsets and gun holsters who consult computer terminals.}
<C>__{minerva }
<D>__{gold fi ing er!}
<A>__{hawk and anna turn to see minerva splashily enter in sexy funeral wear.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{sorry, i couldn't resist. you're probably wondering why you're still alive. anna.....}
<A>__{as minerva speaks, technician one forcibly escorts anna toward a stand near the gold machine and tightly handcuffs her to it.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{i want you to monitor the da vinci's directions from the apprentice diary. and hawk, i didn't want you to go to hell without knowing that darwin and i's dream came true.}
<P>__{(suddenly sheepish)}
<D>__{beside that, none of us can seem to put that damn crystal together. alfie and i were up all night with the thing.}
<A>__{technician two commences a forcible escort of hawk to the gold machine. hawk cold cocks him to the ground.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{you killed a friend. why should i help you go for the gold?}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{it'll take a couple of years of steady production, but i will flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns. markets will crash crash. financial empires will crumble crumble.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{except yours yours. the goal of world domination. well, if you put it that way, minnie. how can i resist?}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{you can't, convict! you're just a shmoe! every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them. it rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "how could this happen to me?" it's a natural inclination. but for i, this isn't a fantasy, it is reality ! you are on my planet! you walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist! the lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to me!}
<A>__{anna looks at the oil cloth diary before her. she pulls a compact from her pocket and holds the compact mirror over the scribblings. reading off the reflection, her eyes widen.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{do it. there's no reason to fight anymore. she's a force of nature.}
<A>__{trying to get a grip on anna's words, hawk lets himself be escorted to another stand before the gold machine that has the two complex crystal parts and the weird mirror.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{if you pull this off, i can't promise i won't kill you. i mean, who we trying to kid? but i will spare the flying nun here....}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{and to think i thought you were evil incarnate in pumps.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{i killed some lovable working class italian diabetic, but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind, gentle lover. so don't play with me.}
<A>__{minerva flicks a switch on the stand anna's handcuffed to. anna vibrates, being electrocuted.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{okay, fine!}
<A>__{minerva switches it off. giving himself a head rub, hawk bears down on the three oddly malleable objects. he tangles and bends and with a loud snap, puts them together, forming the crystal from the opening scene. minerva snatches it from him and puts on a head set.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{oh hawk, don't ever change. go, team, go!}
<A>__{minerva giddily sets the crystal in the same place as da vinci had it in his machine. using a long steel pole, technician one adjusts a myriad of mirrors so they are in a proper angle with a series of lenses culminating on the top of the machine. technicians two (black eyed) and three pour various chemical powders and liquids into corresponding compart ments on the machine, beautifully decorated by the chemical's zodiac sign. alfred places a lead bar in its proper place. hawk glides to anna and undoes her handcuff.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{i hope you know what....}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{trust leonardo....}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{wha.....}
<A>__{anna puts her fingers on his lips. minerva throws a lever. steam begins to percolate from the furnace towards the machine.}
<C>__{minerva}
<P>__{(into the headset)}
<D>__{we're for real.}
<B>__{the machine}
<A>__{begins to rotate, at first clunkily, then faster. the crystal rotates comfortably in its compartment. the machine throws out its folding arms, each with an element. the arms click higher. the goggled technicians stand before a time coded video monitor, taking notes. the chemical housings open and the chemicals begin to spill and drop through brass tubes.}
<B>__{anna}
<A>__{murmurs to hawk.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{da vinci made the real directions in a secret script that i decoded. the way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down. isn't it wonderful?}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{wha you don't want to know...}
<A>__{hawk pulls out the mirror from his pocket.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{i wanna know...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{holy sh h things are going to get very interesting, very fast. da vinci would be proud of you.}
<B>__{in the machine}
<A>__{the chemicals snake down their individual paths to the lead bar spinning its trough. there's a flash and a controlled but jarring explosion.}
<B>__{everyone}
<A>__{doubletakes. hawk reaches down to the six foot steel pole and with one swing slams the faces of all three deep in concentration technicians to the ground. oblivious to the violence behind her, minerva, pulling on goggles over her head set, moves closer with a religious purr.}
<B>__{the machine}
<A>__{triggers a fresnel lens and laserlike beams bounce around the mirrors faster and faster, circling the room.}
<B>__{outside the machine}
<A>__{hawk and anna squint, blinded. flinging off her goggles, a literally beaming minerva giggles forward.}
<B>__{the machine}
<A>__{beams of light converge on the top mirror and bounce into the innards of the machine with a mighty roar!}
<B>__{minerva}
<A>__{sees that the center of the machine gleams yellowish and molten. she moves closer, shouting into her head set.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{eureka, motherfuckers!}
<A>__{the machine thunders and spins at a more aggressive pace. hawk's voice suddenly comes on minerva's head set.}
<P>__{hawk's voice (head set)}
<D>__{minnie, hate to interrupt your orgasm, but....}
<B>__{hawk and anna}
<A>__{stand above the unconscious technicians. hawk is on head set.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{me, anna, and leonardo just wanna say you got the midas touch, baby...}
<B>__{machine}
<A>__{minerva turns toward the machine in anger and confusion. the center of the machine blows. the pool of molten gold rockets at the viewer. mirrors explode and the lasers slash at the walls. minerva tumbles from the machine, screaming, that is to say, trying to scream, because molten gold covers her face. it bubbles and cascades, turning her into a bizarrely beautiful echo of nefertiti.}
<B>__{hawk and anna}
<A>__{turn to retreat, and see, standing in the mouth of the open double doors, in an open shirt, wearing indian war paint on his face and the words rule britannia painted on his chest, alfred!}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{how.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{you're unemployed, alfie. boss is dead. her plan is over.}
<C>__{alfred}
<P>__{(strange voiced)}
<D>__{my plan is just beginning. i will forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but i'm afraid the birth of the new british empire can have no witnesses!}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{ooh kay...}
<A>__{alfred rushes forward with a howl. hawk meets him halfway. they trade savage punches and then lock onto each other's throats. anna pulls a gun from a technician's holster and prays for forgiveness. she aims steadily, and fires... right into hawk's arm. this allows alfred to knock him back with a strong punch.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{sorry!}
<A>__{she fires again. the bullet pings off hawk's belt buckle.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{stop helping me! thou shalt not kill!}
<A>__{hawk's turning to chastize anna, allows alfred to kick hawk back against a wall. alfred lunges out with his blade, hitting the wall off angle. hawk yanks the shaft. alfred goes with the flow and presses the shaft on hawk's throat. gasping, hawk looks to a rip in alfred's shirt and sees a hinge and lever on the shaft. with an all or nothing jerk, hawk flicks the lever. the shaft clicks on the hinge. alfred's greater strength and narrower grip makes it fold away from hawk and suddenly it is alfred's throat which is caught in the v shaped trap! the momentum of the sudden change makes alfred stumble towards the wall until the point of the "v" hits it }
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{don't lose your head over this.}
<A>__{hawk takes the six foot steel pole and gives a babe ruth swing right onto the v. the blades slam together and pop alfred's head off, sending it screaming disembodied,}
<B>__{high in the air.}
<A>__{alfred's screaming head p.o.v. hawk and anna are seen waving up to the viewer (alfie's head).}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{excuse my crass american humor.}
<A>__{the machine thunders with another explosion.}
<B>__{the da vinci workshop}
<A>__{hawk and anna rush into the da vinci workshop. she guiltily touches the surface wound on his arm. he delicately takes the gun from her and laughs until he sees... bunny the dog!! standing in the open mouth of the workshop. anna turns to hawk...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{allow me.}
<A>__{anna confidently moves toward the dog until bunny leaps up and savagely clamps his teeth into her throat sending her crashing to the ground. hawk pauses in disbelief before raising the gun. bunny continues to viciously gnaw away on the convulsing anna, blood gently starts to emerge. hawk can't get off a shot. he throws down the gun in exasperation. it lands next to the gadget that is connected to the tennis ball machine. hawk rushes forward, picks up the gadget, turns the dial to ten, and then smiles sweetly toward the dog.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{oh bunny, ball ball.}
<A>__{bunny stops his violent behavior and perkily looks up blood droplets drizzling from his mouth. hawk slams down on the gadget. a tennis ball comes rocketing out of the machine. bunny leaps and catches the rocketing ball but the force of it sends him flying and crashing out a window. hawk pulls up anna as the machine completely explodes. a huge chunk of the roof thuds before the workshop door. hawk suddenly looks off camera and smiles. anna shakes her head vigorously. he pulls her out of the frame.}
