<L>__{exterior ocean day}
<A>__{the storm has passed. the raft floats on big dark rollers. we hear the chirping and squeaking of dolphins. they come close to the raft. chuck watches them play. then realizes they are chasing his fish. they drive them along, into the path of another dolphin, who darts in and rips into the dorado, turning the water around the raft into churning, bloody foam.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{he takes his oar and begins beating the water. the killing continues.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you fucking murderers!}
<A>__{suddenly the water is still. one dolphin sticks its head out of the water and stares at chuck, squeaking. another dolphin lifts its head up, then another. they squeak to each other, clearly communicating and talking about chuck.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i know you're talking about me!}
<A>__{he splashes the water with his oar. they dive, then jump into the air, squeaking as they go.}
<C>__{chuck}
<P>__{(very softly)}
<D>__{take me with you.}
<A>__{they're gone.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{why me? why me, god?}
<A>__{he begins to laugh.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{listen to this, wilson.}
<P>__{(deep voice: god)}
<D>__{because you piss me off.}
