<A>__{it is late, the supermarket all but deserted. we are tracking in on a fortyish man in bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the dairy case. he is the dude. his rumpled look and relaxed manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep. he is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their expiration dates.}
<D>__{voice over now this story i'm about to unfold took place back in the early nineties just about the time of our conflict with sad'm and the eye rackies. i only mention it 'cause some times there's a man i won't say a hee ro, 'cause what's a hee ro? but sometimes there's a man.}

<D>__{voice over ...and even if he's a lazy man, and the dude was certainly that quite possibly the laziest in los angeles county.}

<D>__{voice over ...which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide but sometimes there's a man. . . sometimes there's a man.}
