<A>__{and that's the interview. emily stares at the blank blue screen, transfixed, lowers her gaze to the table. there's a photo tucked inside the psychiatric file. edward and margaret in happier times young bible camp counselors in t shirts and hiking boots on a path through sunlit forest. sweet. innocent. emily's age. the year they met perhaps. she holds it up to the newspaper mugshots for a before and after comparison. the transformation of their faces is shocking. emily sits frozen by the realization: edward and margaret sheridan. not criminals. victims.}
