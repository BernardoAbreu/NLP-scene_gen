<L>__{exterior open sea day}
<A>__{hiccup and toothless blur past, leaving a wake that leads...}
<L>__{exterior berk day}
<A>__{(sequence 0200 new berk) to the island village of berk, festively adorned with flags and banners. major new additions alter its familiar skyline.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{this... is berk. the best kept secret this side of, well, anywhere. granted, it may not look like much, but this wet heap of rock packs more than a few surprises.}
<A>__{on a cluster of sheep, hiding nervously between buildings as shadows of passing dragons race by. the group moves as one, receding into a shadowy alley, pushing one sheep out into the light. it's suddenly snatched and carried into the air!}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{life here is amazing, just not for the faint of heart. see, where most folks enjoy hobbies like whittling or needlepoint, we berkians prefer a little something we like to call }
<A>__{whoosh, whoosh, whoosh! a wash of vibrant colors blurs by. dragons barrel past at a dizzying speed. their riders swipe, kick, and roll into one another while they weave neck in neck between the houses, docks, and revamped structures of berk.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{dragon racing!}
<A>__{it's like an aerial version of the monte carlo race. spectators roar from wooden bleachers, fastened to cliff faces and perched over the sea. fishlegs, now 20 and even larger, rides his gronkle, meatlug, who carries the sheep in her claws, until... snotlout, also 20, but every bit as juvenile, and his monstrous nightmare, hookfang, steal the sheep from them.}
<C>__{snotlout}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry, fishlegs! did you want that?}
<C>__{fishlegs}
<D>__{snotlout! that's mine!}
<A>__{snotlout falls back toward ruffnut and tuffnut, who lag on their two headed zippleback, barf & belch.}
<C>__{snotlout}
<D>__{here ya go, babe.}
<A>__{with a chivalrous grin, snotlout tosses the sheep to ruffnut. she snatches it with a sneer and a grumble.}
<C>__{snotlout }
<D>__{did i tell you that you look amazing today? `cause you do.}
<C>__{ruffnut}
<D>__{come on, barf. it's starting to stink around here.}
<A>__{barf starts to peel off, spewing gas. tuffnut mocks snotlout with a mugging grin.}
<C>__{tuffnut}
<D>__{nope. still hates you. let's blow this place, belch!}
<A>__{belch ignites the gas, sparking a flashy explosion, and leaving snotlout behind in the smoke. as they rush past the main bleachers, ruffnut drops her sheep into one of five baskets suspended over a chasm at the lap crossing. each backboard bears an image of its corresponding dragon. the barf belch basket filled to the brim with sheep. presiding over the game, stoick turns to the frenzied crowd.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{that's nine for the twins, astrid lags with three, fishlegs and snotlout trail with none!}
<A>__{stoick eyes an empty basket at the far end, its backboard painted with an image of toothless.}
<C>__{stoick }
<D>__{and hiccup is... nowhere to be found. hmmm.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{scared him off with the big talk, didn't ya, stoick?}
<A>__{whack! snotlout, still smoldering from the blast, gets clipped from behind. astrid, rolls in, astride stormfly spirited and competitive as ever, and beautiful despite herself.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{what are you doing, snotlout?! they're going to win now!}
<C>__{snotlout}
<D>__{she's my princess! whatever she wants, she gets.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{ruffnut?! didn't she try to bury you alive?!}
<C>__{snotlout}
<D>__{only for a few hours!}
<A>__{back to the racers, as they peel away, pouring on the speed.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{dragons used to be a bit of a problem here. but that was five years ago. now they've all moved in. and, really, why wouldn't they?}
<A>__{the racers chase each other through a sprawling hangar and into a vast cave, teeming with colorfully painted dragon stables. they exit through the far side and circle back through the village, blasting past many of its dragon friendly additions.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{we have custom stables... all you can eat feeding stations... a full service dragon wash...}
<A>__{in the village, a baby gronkle sneezes, accidentally setting one of the viking houses aflame.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{even top of the line fire prevention, if i do say so myself.}
<A>__{astrid rolls her eyes, peels away from the other dragon racers, and yanks open a spout on the overhead network of aqueducts, dousing the flames with a surge of water. back to stoick, amused as he watches the racers round the island, searching for sheep. he turns to gobber and nods.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{it's time, gobber.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{righty ho!}
<P>__{(aloud, to the crowd)}
<D>__{last lap!}
<A>__{a horn sounds. the racers all turn to each other, excited.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{the black sheep! come on, stormfly! we can still win this thing!}
<C>__{ruffnut}
<D>__{come on, barf!}
<C>__{tuffnut}
<D>__{let's go!}
<C>__{fishlegs}
<D>__{go, meatlug!}
<A>__{gobber loads the black sheep onto a catapult.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{this is your big moment. have a nice flight!}
<A>__{he pulls the trigger, launching the black sheep into the air. astrid spots it and steers stormfly into a steep climb toward it.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{up, up, up!}
<A>__{in a flash, fishlegs and meatlug blur past, nabbing the sheep.}
<C>__{astrid }
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{fishlegs}
<D>__{good job, meatlug!}
<A>__{fishlegs tosses his captured prize to ruffnut.}
<C>__{fishlegs }
<D>__{here you go, darling. mine's worth ten!}
<C>__{ruffnut}
<D>__{yeah! the black sheep!}
<A>__{snotlout sighs, frustrated.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{you guys are fighting for ruffnut?!}
<C>__{ruffnut}
<D>__{i'm totally winning!}
<A>__{fishlegs hovers up nest to ruffnut with a starry eyed smile.}
<C>__{fishlegs}
<D>__{we're winning together!}
<A>__{she rams barf into meatlug, sending fishlegs into an uncontrolled spin. he slams into snotlout, sending their dragons tumbling head over tail. the crowd goes wild.}
<C>__{ruffnut}
<D>__{no one can stop me now!}
<C>__{tuffnut}
<D>__{except for me. we're attached, genius!}
<A>__{he grabs at the sheep. ruffnut fights back, inciting a tug of war.}
<C>__{tuffnut }
<D>__{quit trying to steal all my glory!}
<A>__{and while they're distracted, astrid steers stormfly toward them, closing in.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{get `em, astrid!}
<C>__{tuffnut ruffnut}
<A>__{it's my glory! no sheep, no you're always ruining glory! everything! astrid leaps off of stormfly, runs up belch's spindly neck, and plucks the black sheep from the twins' hands.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{gotcha!}
<A>__{she tumbles through the air onto stormfly, sticking a perfect landing, black sheep in hand.}
<C>__{ruffnut}
<D>__{astrid!}
<A>__{back to stoick, beside himself. the crowd roars.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{well played! hahaha!}
<P>__{(gloating, to the crowd)}
<D>__{that's my future daughter in law!}
<B>__{back to astrid on stormfly}
<A>__{eyeing the fast approaching finish line, unaware as... fishlegs suddenly rams meatlug into stormfly, sending astrid off course. she recovers and sees snotlout flying headlong toward her, war hammer cocked, aiming at astrid.}
<C>__{snotlout}
<D>__{uh, excuse me.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{stormfly!}
<A>__{snotlout hurls his hammer. astrid ducks and rolls stormfly out of the way. the hammer catches fishlegs in the face with a clang. the crowd collectively winces. astrid and stormfly recover from their roll, loop over the water, and they blast past the finish line, dunking the black sheep into their basket!}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{that's thirteen! astrid takes the game!}
<A>__{the crowd comes unhinged. astrid flies over the crowd, basking in her victory.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{yep. berk is pretty much perfect. all of my hard work has paid off. and it's a good thing, too, because with vikings on the backs of dragons, the world just got a whole lot bigger.}
<L>__{exterior open sky island coastline day}
<A>__{(scene 0300 awol part one) a boundless sky. vast. clear. crisp. and from it, a black speck rockets across the horizon. the image of unbridled freedom. tucked into his riding position, hiccup appears to be part of toothless. they dip, roll and dive, over a sea teeming with thunderdrums, pulling off daring maneuvers with honed refinement, making them seem effortless.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{yeah!}
<A>__{they jackknife, heading skyward, rolling and tumbling through the ethereal cloud scapes and joining high flying timberjacks as they soar in formation. hiccup is bound head to toe in a snug, aerodynamic flight suit an asymmetrical, functional design of leather and articulated plates. it has an air of viking bike leather.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{what do you think, bud? wanna give this another shot?}
<A>__{toothless grumbles in protest.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{toothless! it'll be fine.}
<A>__{with a click of a lever, he locks the pedals in the flared tail position. hiccup then unhooks himself from the saddle.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{ready?}
<A>__{toothless snorts unenthusiastically. suddenly, hiccup slides off of toothless, peeling away from him like a skydiver from a plane, yelling as he plummets. toothless dives after him. they spiral through the air, face to face. toothless is having fun, despite himself. hiccup slips his forearms through a pair of tucked leather flaps... and yanks, unfurling sheets of leather as he extends his arms. they catch the wind, snapping open like wings... and sending him gliding out of control, at first, then stabilizing. the turbulence buffets his flight suit heavily. but he's flying! toothless unfolds his wings, too, catching up with hiccup. the freedom is palpable. hiccup and toothless are, for the moment, the same. feeling the same rush of adrenaline. independently together. they plunge past cloud formations, splitting apart then crossing paths again. impressive as it is, hiccup is gliding at a steep angle. toothless launches fireballs ahead of hiccup, boosting him higher with the expanding heat bursts.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{this is amazing!}
<A>__{a cloud layer washes past, exposing a towering rock formation, dead ahead.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{no longer amazing! toothless!}
<A>__{hiccup tries to steer himself away, to no avail. toothless pours on the speed, trying to catch hiccup as he hurtles toward collision. his locked tail makes maneuvering difficult. he's unable to pull up at a steep enough angle.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{oh, no!}
<A>__{at the last second, toothless blasts the jagged rocks just ahead of hiccup, then wraps hiccup in his wings as they fly through it. the obliterated peak rains down around them. toothless emerges through the cloud of debris and hurtles into the trees of a neighboring peak. they tumble down the uneven terrain, coming to rest on a small plateau. hiccup emerges from the cocoon of toothless' wings. he switches his prosthetic riding foot to his walking foot and stows his leather wings.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{that really came out of nowhere.}
<A>__{the blown up sea stack collapses.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{we gotta work on your solo gliding there, bud. that locked up tail makes for some pretty sloppy rescue maneuvers, eh?}
<A>__{hiccup reels in his dorsal fin and removes his helmet, revealing a 20 year old hiccup framed by wild hair, complete with a viking braid. he walks to the edge of the cliff, taking in the new land stretching off into the horizon, its tall cliffs and sea stacks adorned with swaying gold birch trees basking in the dappled afternoon sunlight.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{looks like we found another one, bud.}
<A>__{toothless fusses and snorts, not amused, shaking off dust and pebbles like a wet dog. hiccup flinches as a pebble whacks him on the back of the head. he looks back to toothless, who averts his eyes.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{oh, what? do you want an apology? is that why you're pouting, big baby boo? well... try this on!}
<A>__{hiccup tackles toothless and tries to put him in a headlock.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{ya feeling it yet? huh? picking up on all my heartfelt remorse?}
<A>__{toothless simply stands on his hind legs, lifting hiccup off of his flailing feet and dangling him over the cliff's edge.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{oh, come on. you wouldn't hurt a one legged }
<A>__{hiccup looks down, seeing the precipitous drop below.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{you're right! you're right! you win! you win!}
<A>__{wham! toothless flips him over, pinning him to the ground. hiccup squirms, throwing mock punches. toothless playfully retaliates with feline taps to hiccup's head.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{he's down! and it's ugly! dragons and vikings, enemies again, locked in combat to the bitter urfff!}
<A>__{toothless rests his head on hiccup squeezing the air out of him. toothless then suddenly starts grooming hiccup, lapping at his face and covering him in slobber.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{gaaaaagh!}
<A>__{hiccup fights to get free, finally springing to his feet and shaking off the viscous saliva.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{you know that doesn't wash out.}
<A>__{toothless laughs, pleased with himself. shifting his attention back to the new land stretched out before them, hiccup reaches beneath his chest plate and produces a leather bound book. he unfurls it to reveal an explorers map, modified with added strips in every direction to accommodate their ever expanding world. drawings indicate new lands, new tribes, and many new dragons. hiccup peels a fresh strip of paper from a hidden fold in his flight suit and holds it out for toothless to lick. hiccup affixes the moistened strip to the map's outer edge, then whittles a pencil and consults a compass affixed to his forearm.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{so what should we name it?}
<A>__{toothless gurgles as he gnaws under his wing, preoccupied.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{"itchy armpit" it is.}
<A>__{hiccup carefully draws the new island's outline.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{whaddya reckon, bud? think we might find a few timberjacks in those woods? the odd whispering death or two in the rocks? who knows... maybe we'll finally track down another night fury.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{wouldn't that be something?}
<P>__{(burdened)}
<D>__{so, whaddya say? just keep going?}
<A>__{toothless' ear plates suddenly shoot up. he roars, and his call is answered by a familiar screech. hiccup turns to see...}
<L>__{exterior sea stack island coastline day}
<A>__{(scene 0325 awol part two) astrid rising into view, astride stormfly. stormfly grabs talon fulls of rock to slow her landing.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{`afternoon m'lady. where have you been?}
<A>__{astrid dismounts and throws back her fur hood as toothless rushes up to greet them.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{winning races. what else? the real question is... where have you been?}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{avoiding my dad.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{oh, no. what happened now?}
<A>__{astrid sits beside hiccup, inspecting his latest addition to the map. behind them, toothless greets stormfly, inciting a play fight.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{oh, you're gonna love this. i wake up. the sun's shining. terrible terrors are singing on the rooftop. i saunter down to breakfast, thinking all is right with the world, and i get...}
<A>__{he gets to his feet and puffs out his chest.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<P>__{(aping stoick)}
<D>__{... son, we need to talk.}
<A>__{astrid smiles and adopts hiccup's sloppy slouch.}
<C>__{astrid}
<P>__{(aping hiccup)}
<D>__{not now, dad. i've got a whole day of goofing off to get started.}
<A>__{hiccup breaks character, grimacing at her impression of him.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{okay, first of all, i don't sound like that. what is this character? and second... what is that thing you're doing with my shoulders?}
<A>__{astrid laughs, jostling her shoulders in an awkward way.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{a truly flattering impersonation. anyway, he goes...}
<P>__{(resuming stoick's brogue)}
<D>__{you're the pride of berk, son, and i couldn't be prouder...}
<C>__{astrid}
<P>__{(continuing her impression of hiccup)}
<D>__{aw, thanks, dad. i'm pretty impressed with myself, too.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{when have i ever done that with my hands?}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{you just did.}
<A>__{she laughs, playfully.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{okay... just...}
<P>__{(holding her arms, mock stern)}
<D>__{hold still. it's very serious.}
<A>__{she giggles, trying to hold a straight face.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<P>__{(resuming stoick's brogue)}
<D>__{you're all grown up, and since no chief could ask for a better successor, i've decided }
<A>__{astrid straightens, her face brightening.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{ to make you chief! oh, my gods!}
<A>__{she jumps to her feet, beaming...}
<C>__{astrid }
<D>__{hiccup, that's amazing!}
<A>__{and socks hiccup in congratulations, deliberately hitting the dorsal fin release button and triggering it to pop up. she laughs as hiccup reels it back in, self consciously.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{you're gonna wear out the spring coil. the calibration is very sensitive!}
<A>__{they're suddenly bowled over by toothless and stormfly.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{yeah, so... this is what i'm dealing with.}
<A>__{astrid helps him up and dusts him off.}
<C>__{astrid}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{what did you tell him?}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{i didn't. by the time he turned around, i was gone.}
<A>__{astrid picks up the map, folding it as she paces around him, processing it all.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{well, it's a lot of responsibility. the map will have to wait for sure, and i will need to fly toothless, since you'll be too busy...}
<A>__{she pauses, wincing in sympathy. she turns to hiccup. he nods knowingly, taking the map from her.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{it's not me, astrid. all those speeches, and planning, and running the village... that's his thing.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{i think you're missing the pointerior i mean, chief. what an honor. i'd be pretty excited.}
<A>__{hiccup shakes his head.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{i'm not like you. you know exactly who you are. you always have. but...}
<A>__{he shuffles to the cliff's edge, gazing out at the new land.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{i'm still looking. i know that i'm not my father... and i never met my mother... so, what does that make me?}
<A>__{he sits at the edge, looking burdened, restless. astrid approaches and settles beside him, joining him in looking out at the distant horizon. she weaves another braid into his hair as she speaks.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{what you're searching for... isn't out there, hiccup.}
<A>__{she places a hand on his chest.}
<C>__{astrid }
<D>__{it's in here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{maybe you just don't see it yet.}
<A>__{she kisses his cheek, but gets a mouthful of toothless' slobber. she grimaces, wiping it off. distracted, hiccup eyes the horizon keenly.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{maybe. but, y'know... there is something out there.}
<C>__{astrid}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{hiccup...}
<A>__{he turns her face to the horizon. a distant smoke plume rises from a misty valley.}
<L>__{exterior lapland woods trapper's fort moments later}
<A>__{(scene 0400 shot down!) hiccup and toothless fly over the fjord, winding deep through undulating crimson and gold forests. astrid and stormfly catch up as the autumn colors suddenly give way to charred timbers. they fly deeper, through ash and wafting smoke. ahead, in a sheltered harbor, an explosion of ice stands as an eerie marker of what used to be a trapper's}
<B>__{fort.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{stay close.}
<A>__{they fly through the suspended remains of the buildings, splintered, and frozen in mid destruction.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{what happened here?}
<A>__{it's at once harrowing and puzzling. toothless spots an enormous dragon footprint in the muddy shoreline below, leaving him uneasy.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{easy, bud.}
<A>__{as they crest the ice formations, astrid spots a crew of men at the stern of a moored ship below.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{hiccup!}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{fire!}
<A>__{the men fire a stern mounted cannon. the projectile unfurls into a net. hiccup and toothless dart out of its way.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{astrid! look out!}
<A>__{it hits stormfly, tangling her wings and causing her to spin uncontrolled. astrid struggles to free her as they hurtle toward a collision.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{hiccup!}
<A>__{astrid falls off of stormfly, but toothless snatches her at the last second. stormfly hits the ground, tangled in the net. trappers rush out of hiding, piling onto her with ropes and weapons. she whips her tail, sending spikes flying.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{watch the tail!}
<A>__{a large, raven haired trapper lunges over the spray of spikes and lands upon stormfly's head, twisting it and taking her down like a rodeo cowboy.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{tie those legs up!}
<A>__{eret deftly ties her gnashing jaws shut, wrangling her into submission clearly a pro among pros. he looks up, revealing a handsome face and gleaming, intelligent eyes that search the sky as toothless' tell tale banshee scream rings out.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{is that what i think it is?}
<A>__{toothless suddenly streaks across the sky, banking and landing with a ferocious roar.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{stop!}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{stormfly!}
<P>__{(to the trappers)}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{astrid and hiccup leap off of toothless, rushing toward stormfly. eret's men immediately draw weapons. hiccup extends and ignites his dragon blade a telescoping fiery sword impressive enough to wow eret's men.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{back again?}
<A>__{eret steps forward, focused only on toothless.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{soil my britches... that is a night fury. thought they were all gone for good.}
<P>__{(to his fellow trappers)}
<D>__{looks like our luck's had a turn for the better, lads! don't think drago has one of those in his dragon army.}
<A>__{his men sound out in agreement. hiccup eyes astrid, confused.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{dragon army?}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{look, we don't want any trouble.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{ha! you should've thought of that before you stole all of our dragons and blasted our fort to bits!}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{wait...}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<A>__{astrid and hiccup take in the icy destruction, putting it together.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{you think we did this?}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{dragon trapping is hard enough work as it is, without do gooder dragon riders sneaking in to rescue them.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{what do gooder there are other dragon riders?}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{you mean, other than your thieving friend from last night? you tell me.}
<A>__{eret approaches. toothless snarls, protectively.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{you may have an ice spitting dragon on your side, but we still have a quota to fill. how do you suppose we explain this mess to drago bludvist?}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{drago what fist? does anything you say make sense?}
<C>__{teeny}
<D>__{he's expecting a new shipment of dragons for his army by tomorrow. no name and drago don't take well to excuses.}
<A>__{eret parts his tunic, revealing a large branding iron scar on his torso, in the shape of a dragon skull, split by a sword.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{this is what he gave me last time i showed up empty handed. he promised to be far less understanding in the future.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{look, we don't know anything about a dragon thief, or an ice spitting dragon, or your lunatic boss and his dragon army, okay?}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{just give us back our dragon, and we'll go, strange, hostile person whom we've never met.}
<A>__{eret bows playfully.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{oh, where are my manners? i'm eret. son of eret. finest dragon trapper alive.}
<A>__{he pulls a dagger from behind his back, waving it cockily. his men ready their weapons and net cannons.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{after all, it's not just anyone who can capture a night fury.}
<A>__{toothless roars a warning.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{and this is toothless. he says we're going. now.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{heh. they all say that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{rush `em, lads!}
<A>__{eret lunges toward them. toothless blasts, bringing down a massive spire of ice. it shatters as it hits the ground, forcing eret and his men to dive out of the way. making quick use of the distraction, hiccup re ignites his dragon blade and slashes through the ropes binding stormfly.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{stormfly! c'mon, go! go!}
<A>__{eret gets to his feet in time to see toothless and stormfly take to the air, carrying hiccup and astrid out of reach of the volley of arrows.}

<A>__{on astrid and gobber, watching from a distance, horrified. as valka pounds at the ice, a glows forms from deep within. she realizes what is about to happen and backs away. a blast thunders from inside the ice, shattering it. toothless emerges from the debris, revealing hiccup curled safely under his wings. toothless is steaming, his black skin glowing blue with rage, his split dorsal blades searing with blue heat, a glow emanating from his flared nostrils. he turns back to hiccup, to check if he's unharmed, then turns his full attention back to the bewilderbeast. he leaps out of the crater and lands upon an ice spire, roaring ferociously. the bewilderbeast bellows back at this affront. toothless unleashes a salvo of plasma into the bewilderbeast's face, not letting up.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{he's challenging the alpha!}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{to protect you.}
<A>__{the bewilderbeast roars at this act of insubordination. toothless fires back, time and again, fully in control. the alpha thrashes his tusks through the ice, trying to smash toothless, but he deftly spring from spire to spire, continuing his unrelenting attack. in the midst of the mayhem, the horde of commandeered dragons both berk's and valka's break free from the control to witness toothless' retaliation. toothless lands protectively by hiccup and valka, commanding the dragons to shift sides. the follow, amassing behind toothless. seeing this, drago panics and rushes toward the bewilderbeast.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{no, no, no, no! fight back! fight! fight!}
<A>__{drago clambers up the bewilderbeast's tusk, totally unhinged.}
<C>__{drago }
<P>__{(to the defecting dragons)}
<D>__{what's the matter with you?}
<A>__{the berkians swell in to show their unified support. drago fumes as hiccup and toothless fly up together onto an ice spire.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{now do you get it? this is what it is to earn a dragon's loyalty.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{let this end now.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{never! come on!}
<A>__{he hammers the bewilderbeast, spurring it into a charge. toothless calls over his shoulder, commanding the dragons to ready themselves. he then blasts the bewilderbeast, mid charge. suddenly, skullcrusher fires. followed by another, and another. hiccup looks around, amazed to see the flock of dragons opening fire on drago and his bewilderbeast. they've started a rebellion. drago is forced to hide from the fiery barrage by taking cover in the tall spines of the giant's crown.}
<C>__{drago }
<D>__{fight! blast them!}
<A>__{his prosthetic arm is blasted clean off by one of his own armored dragons. the bewilderbeast rears back to cover them all in ice, but toothless lets loose a powerful shot. the bewilderbeast's head is knocked backward by a blue flame fireball. as the smoke clears, one of its massive tusks falls to the ground, sheared clean off. drago glares at toothless. toothless roars commandingly, calling an end to the fight.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{the alpha protects them all.}
<A>__{overwhelmed and overpowered, the bewilderbeast yields to the new alpha and heeds toothless' command, retreating into the sea in an explosive splash. the berkians cheer in victory! as the smoke clears, hiccup and toothless see nothing but bubbles on the waves to mark their disappearance. no sign of the bewilderbeast... or drago. toothless hops down from the spire, cooling off, as people celebrate all around them. all of the dragons berk's, valka's, even drago's land around toothless. cloudjumper bows to toothless, starting a wave of bows, acknowledging their new alpha. toothless looks around, surprised, then lets out a majestic roar. the assembled dragons join in, roaring in tribute. toothless turns to hiccup as he approaches.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{you never cease to amaze me, bud. thank you.}
<A>__{toothless gurgles and licks hiccup's face. hiccups squeals, trying to get away.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{toothless! you know that doesn't wash out.}

<A>__{stormfly bounds into astrid.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{oh, give me a cuddle, grumpy!}
<A>__{grump lands on top of gobber, flattening him. relieved to the point of tears, snotlout and fishlegs race towards the expectant ruffnut...}

<D>__{who's my little princess?}
<A>__{... and then right past her to embrace their dragons.}
<C>__{fishlegs }
<D>__{i missed you so much!}

<D>__{don't you ever leave again, hookfang!}

<A>__{she hugs him. belch looms in for some affection, but ruffnut pushes him away...}
<C>__{ruffnut }
<D>__{not you.}
<A>__{and into tuffnut who glowers back at her. hiccup smiles, taking in the happy reunions. skullcrusher approaches him, without an owner to reunite with. hiccup pets him, as eret approaches.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{that was some pretty fine dragon wrangling back there. you'd make a good trapper.}
<A>__{before hiccup can respond, skullcrusher nuzzles eret affectionately. eret chuckles and gently strokes him.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{y'know, skullcrusher's gonna need somebody to look after him now.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{me?}
<A>__{hiccup nods reassuringly. eret looks at skullcrusher, pausing to consider it.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{i'd be honored.}
<A>__{valka walks up to her son, bursting with pride.}
<C>__{valka}

<D>__{thank you. i'm really glad you're here, mom.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{and here i will stay.}
<A>__{toothless arrives, purring at valka's touch as astrid strides toward hiccup, beaming proudly.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{see? i told you it was in here.}
<A>__{she places her hand upon his chest, then quickly pokes the dorsal fin button, popping it open. she giggles.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{ha, ha. still doing that one? that's hilarious.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{come here, you.}
<A>__{he scoops astrid close and pulls her into a kiss. gobber covers a gawking boy's eyes.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{ooh.}
<A>__{gothi, the elder, taps hiccup's shoulder, interrupting the romantic moment. she gestures for hiccup to kneel. he does so, respectfully. using ash from a heap of burnt wreckage, gothi traces a viking symbol onto hiccup's forehead. she bows. hiccup stands, meeting gobber's proud, smiling eyes. gobber turns to the silent crowd and throws up his arms.}
<C>__{gobber }
<D>__{the chief has come home!}
<A>__{the berkians erupt with cheers and applause as hiccup takes in the moment, acknowledging the weight of responsibility now upon him. toothless throws back his head and blasts in celebration, spurring all other dragons to follow suit, lighting up the sky in a spectacular display.}
<L>__{exterior berk village day}
<A>__{(scene 2700 a new beginning) a sheep grazes lazily on the grass as a terrible terror struggles in vain to carry him off. suddenly, both are snatched up by a passing dragon.}
<B>__{in the air}
<A>__{ruffnut and tuffnut wrestle over the sheep atop barf & belch. ruffnut send the sheep flying toward fishlegs. snotlout nabs it instead, blowing a kiss mockingly.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{this... is berk. a bit trampled and busted and covered in ice, but it's home. it's our home.}
<A>__{they swoop past a gathered crowd on the battered bleachers as snotlout dunks the sheep in his basket. eret joins the race atop skullcrusher. they fly past hiccup and toothless, who are steadily hoisting a palette of timber and supplies onto a rooftop where workers are rebuilding the damaged houses. hiccup then turns his attention to a massive statue of stoick, presently under construction. he grins with pride.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{those who attacked us are relentless and crazy. but those who stopped them? oh, even more so!}
<A>__{he looks to the horizon, scanning it from east to west to ensure that no trouble is approaching. astrid and stormfly buzz past him playfully, coaxing him to join the game. he smiles.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{we may be small in numbers, but we stand for something bigger than anything the world can pit against us.}
<A>__{astrid soars past the blacksmith stall, waving to valka and gobber as they remove the armor from drago's freed battle dragons.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{we are the voice of peace. and bit by bit, we will change this world.}
<A>__{realizing that he's late, gobber hurries over to the sheep launcher and pulls the trigger, sending the black sheep hurtling into the air. astrid and stormfly close in on the black sheep, about to snatch it out of the air, when suddenly, hiccup and toothless dart past, beating them to it. toothless looks back with a gummy smile.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{you see, we have something they don't. oh sure, they have armies and they have armadas...}
<A>__{toothless and hiccup dive toward the line of baskets. as they approach, toothless bounces hiccup into the air, allowing him to dunk the black sheep into astrid's basket. they reunite on the other side. the crowd cheers!}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{but we... we have...}
<A>__{hiccup and toothless land upon the chief's dais, joined by astrid, stormfly, and the other dragon riders.}
