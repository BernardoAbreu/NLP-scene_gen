<D>__{it's the day of the films' release, october 25th. it's morning. george opens his front door. his chauffeur is outside. the man's expression announces bad news. he's holding the day's press. the huge headlines talk of a stock market crash, a black thursday, a catastrophe. dressed in a robe, george is on the telephone in the living room. he nods. the atmosphere is stifling. he hangs up. his chauffeur looks at him inquisitively. george replies as though lost in thought: title card: it would seem that we're ruined. the chauffeur takes it on the chin with as much reserve as he can muster, but george continues. title card: that's the best case scenario... he almost laughs not so the chauffeur.}
