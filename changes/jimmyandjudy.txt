<ACTION>__{Camera shoots from inside a car hidden camera style as Judy runs laps during her gym class. Judy, again, has no idea that she is being filmed as camera zooms in tight. She's tired, sweating profusely, and looks completely miserable. She stops running, exhausted, as the other kids pass her. Suddenly, a very Butch looking female GYM TEACHER (40) walks over and begins BERATING Judy. The Gym Teacher's face turns red as she spews insults inches away from Judy's face. We can't hear what she's saying, but whatever it is, it's cruel, harsh, and very intense. Exhausted and humiliated, Judy holds back tears as... Camera shuts down.}

Camera Operator wipes dirt from the lens with his shirt revealing his face for the first time as he looks at camera. This is the first time we get even a glimpse of JIMMY WRIGHT (21). His looks are striking, even a bit awkward, but not at all unappealing. He throws a mischievously evil look at the lens, then settles his face back to normal. He spins the camera away, pointing it at the back of his house. Through the kitchen window, Jimmy zooms in on his mother (JIMMY'S MOM) (40's) idyllic version of a mom in new millennium suburban housewife clothes. She's on the phone, preparing dinner.}

School is letting out as he zooms in on Judy. She's looking at the ground as she's taunted by a group of Other Harassing Teenagers, a tear streaming down the side of her cheek. Suddenly, Judy is bashed in the face with a school bag. She falls to the ground, then picks up her broken glasses as camera zooms out to catch the Girl who hit her (Mean Girl). Nearby, a big, Dumb Looking Bully Type (18) taunts her as she cries. His taunts are biting and as excessive as the Mean Girl's, then he dumps a cup of soda on Judy's head as she's crying. Judy screams at the top of her lungs. The group runs off laughing. Jimmy whip pans to the Mean Girl as she laughs with her friends, then whips pans back to Judy, now on her feet, blood running from her nose and onto her white shirt. Camera shuts down.}

He comes in and doesn't say a thing to her. Judy doesn't acknowledge him at all and continues combing her hair as though he's not even there. He comes up behind her, then wraps his arms around her, giving her a warm hug from behind. Something's not right. The masturbation sounds STOP. Judy's noticeably uncomfortable but doesn't resist as her Father begins kissing her neck. His hand slowly creeps down to her pelvic area, his other hand turning out the bedroom light. The room goes dark. Camera flips down, then OFF... Then COMES BACK ON AGAIN Once again we're looking through the camera pointing at the window, but now it's the distorted, grainy, black and white of "Nite Shot" mode. Though we see the Judy's mirror and her dresser, she and her Father are nowhere to be found. Whatever's going on between them, it's going on out of frame, away from the view of the window.

<ACTION>__{Jimmy is hiding in the closet of his parents' bedroom. He has the door of the closet cracked and puts the lens of the camera through the crack. Jimmy's Dad enters the room. He has no idea that he is being filmed and that Jimmy is in the closet. Jimmy's Dad walks over to the dresser, opens up the top drawer and pulls something out. It's too dark in the room to tell exactly what he's pulled out, but it appears to resemble some sort of undergarment. Jimmy's Dad begins undressing, then steps out of frame. After a beat, he reappears. Now he's wearing nothing but a sequined teddy. He's totally fat, hairy, and nasty looking. He sits on the side of the bed, his back to us. Now we see that what he grabbed out of the drawer was actually a pair of fishnet stockings. He begins putting them on. When he is finished putting on his panty hose, he gets up off the bed and begins admiring his legs in a mirror. He begins to gently stroke the sides of his legs, relishing the feel of the hose over his hands and fingertips. He seems to be lip syncing the words to a song and begins to get all worked up. He shakes his hips and dances around the room for a few seconds. Now Jimmy's Dad goes to the dresser and pulls out a long brunette wig from the back of his top drawer. Putting it on, with the fishnet stockings, sequined teddy and long wig, he has transformed himself into the world's fattest, ugliest, hairiest, Cher look-a-like. Someone else enters the room.}

He lets out deep pleasured groans as she continues SMACKING him with the whip harder and harder. He yelps, squeals, and gyrates his hips back and forth, then starts dry humping the air until she stops. Jimmy's Mom comes back through and out of frame. Jimmy's Dad pushes his belly into the bed, groaning from the pain while he waits for her return. She comes back, moving quickly across the screen wearing an enormous strap on dildo. Disappearing out of frame again, Jimmy's Dad gets himself ready for her one more time, ass up, on all fours on the bed. From behind, we can see her hand as she hikes her husband's dress up his back, then we see his face and hear him grunt as she rips his fishnets off screen. There's a pause. Nothing seems to be happening, but Jimmy's Dad is bracing himself for something. His face tightens up. Off screen, Jimmy's Mom has started mounting him from behind. Jimmy can't take it any longer. As he slowly emerges from the closet, his Mom notices Jimmy almost immediately. She jumps off her husband, screaming bloody murder. Camera's shaky but it's easy to guess what's been happening.

The moment she sees it approach, we see her freak just a bit and get into the car quickly and suspiciously. The cop gets up, gets out of the car and goes over to the driver side to talk to Jimmy. After a few moments, he summons Jimmy out of the car while Judy waits. The Cop asks Jimmy to open the trunk.

<ACTION_ALT>__{NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{By the fire pit, the site where the teenage drunken of orgy took place, the bonfire has been put out and there are dozens of drunken/passed out teenagers lying on the ground in sleeping bags and in tents. Jimmy begins looking for Judy with his night vision camera. He sees a girl lying on the ground in a sleeping bag   with her back turned to the camera. Her hair is identical to    Judy's, but we can't see her face. Jimmy quietly steps over    passed out teenagers, being extremely careful not to awaken   anyone. Jimmy accidently kicks a forty ounce beer bottle that causes a loud clanking sound of glass on glass. Jimmy stops in his tracks in anticipation of someone waking up. No one does. Jimmy continues to walk towards the GIRL WHO LOOKS LIKE JUDY. Kneeling directly in front of her, Jimmy puts his hands on her shoulder and pulls the girl's front region towards the camera. The girl flips over. It's not Judy. And luckily, the girl is so severely intoxicated that she doesn't wake up. Jimmy now makes his way over to a tent. He quietly unzips the mesh entrance and extends his arm out to video tape the inside. Turns out, the person in the tent is just another passed out flunky loser. Jimmy quickly takes his arm out of the tent. Jimmy gives it one last go and continues to look for Judy among the sea of passed out bodies lying on the ground. No luck. Jimmy's not too far from Uncle Rodney's trailer.   He decides to make his way up. He walks, using his Nite Shot to see, through the sea of bodies until he gets up to the entrance... OUTSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER There's a cracked glass door leaning up against the woodpile by the entrance. Jimmy steps around it, turning the lens at the glass. He briefly catches his reflection. He looks like hell warmed over, freshly bruised and cut from the recent beating. Moving forward, Jimmy makes it to the front door of Uncle Rodney's trailer. We hear music coming from inside. Very slowly and very carefully, Jimmy cracks the front door. INSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER It's even darker inside of the trailer, but Jimmy presses forward in spite of that fact, still using his Nite Shot to see. A boom box sits by the bed, still on, playing music. Jimmy is scared shitless. In the corner of the room, in a make shift bunk, is Uncle Rodney sleeping with his arms wrapped around a girl in a spooning position. There's no doubt this time. It's definitely JUDY! They are both sound asleep and actually look very cozy lying together. Jimmy slowly walks over towards them. Each step is slower and slower, being extra careful not to wake them. Once Jimmy is within arm's length of the two of them he stops. He hesitates for a moment. He hasn't prepared himself for this particular situation and doesn't know exactly what to do. He continues filming them until he finally musters the courage to extend his non-filming arm out to tap Judy on the face. Judy remains unconscious/sleeping as Jimmy gently taps the side of her cheek. Jimmy slowly begins tapping harder and harder until the tap evolves into a poke. Still nothing. THWACK! An arm comes out of nowhere and grabs Jimmy's poking hand. Jimmy has woken up Uncle Rodney! The camera shakes out of control.   Uncle Rodney screams at the top of his lungs:}
