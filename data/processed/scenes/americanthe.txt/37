<A>__{jack completes his morning exercises then showers and dresses. his manner is precise and methodical. only a man who has lived alone for many years can live like this. when his preparations are complete, he picks up his binoculars and studies the nearby town of castelvecchio through his medieval casement window.}

<A>__{the dead town has come to life! there's a market in progress. the central piazza is a hive of activity. food, local produce, clothes and cheap cd stalls. the market has attracted tourists. standing by a phone box not far from a cheese stall is an attractive woman in dark glasses. she's rifling through her handbag, searching for something. under her right arm is a rolled up copy of il messaggero. we notice the front page of the italian daily newspaper has been folded in half.}
