<P>__{(to bud)}
<D>__{...don't worry, he's got another 20 years in him. he's a tough ol' nut, your dad...}
<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{the blinds are drawn. his dad lies there, tubes down his nose, hooked up to an iv unit and monitors. bud comes over. carl, glassy eyed, significantly frailer, nods to him. it's obvious that more damage was done than bud expected. mom comes into the room with him, stands there.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{hiya dad...}
<P>__{(sits, smiles)}
<D>__{what was it? mom talked too much or was it her spaghetti? i mean pasta...}
<P>__{(mom bringing a handkerchief to her eyes)}
<D>__{i told you never to lift a 747 by yourself...}
<A>__{carl, smiles weakly, on pain killers. bud pulls out a cigarette. he fumbles with it before putting it away, trying to keep a gruff tone between them.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{...you even got me smoking now...second one dad, you're pushing your luck, i guess you know that...i guess you gotta pull through this one dad...for mom, for me...i guess i never told you but...i love you dad, i love you more than i ever.}
<P>__{(begins to weep)}
<D>__{...i didn't mean those things i said to you...you're a hero all the way dad, you're a rock...the best.}
<A>__{the words seem to come flowing out of bud as carl's eyes fill with tears.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{...and you were right about gekko. he's one son of a bitch...through and through.}
<A>__{carl stares at him, beginning to understand.}
<C>__{bud }
<D>__{he's gonna break up bluestar.}
<A>__{carl reacts violently in his eyes but bud soothes him...in dead earnest, trying to be deliberate and clear in his meaning.}
<C>__{bud }
<D>__{...but i gotta plan dad, it can work, i can save the airline, i know you got no reason to believe me but i want you to trust me...i need to talk to the unions...can i speak for you?}
<A>__{carl's eyes.}
<C>__{bud }
<D>__{your words, not mine...}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{you speak for me, son.}
