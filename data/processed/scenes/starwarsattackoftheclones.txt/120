<L>__{interior coruscant, main senate chamber day}
<A>__{inside the great rotunda, the uproar is even louder. opposing senatoes yell furiously at one another.}
<C>__{mas amedda}
<D>__{order! order!!}
<A>__{finally, the uproar dies.}
<C>__{palpatine}
<D>__{in the regrettable absence of senator amidala, the chair recognises senior representative of naboo, jar jar binks.}
<A>__{amid the conflicting storm of cheers and boos, jar jar, with two gungan aides, floats on his pod to the middle of the vast space. he looks at palpatine nervously. palpatine nods. jar jar clears his throat.}
<C>__{jar jar}
<D>__{senators, dellow felagates...}
<A>__{laughter. jeers. jar jar blushes.}
<C>__{mas amedda}
<D>__{order! the senate will accord the representative the courtesy of a hearing!}
<A>__{comparative quiet. jar jar grips the edge of the podium.}
<C>__{jar jar}
<D>__{in response to the direct threat to the republic from the confederacy of independent systems, i propose that the senate gives immediate emergency powers to the supreme chancellor.}
<A>__{uproar. jar jar looks a little sheepish.}
<C>__{jar jar}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{who can deny these are exceptional times? exceptional times demand exceptional measures! exceptional measures demand exceptional men!}
<C>__{orn free taa}
<D>__{we won't support a dictator.}
<A>__{shouts of agreement.}
<C>__{jar jar}
<D>__{that is the sentiment every one of us agrees with! and when the shadow of war has dispersed and the bright day of liberty has dawned once again, the power we now give to the supreme chancellor will be gladly, and swiftly returned. out ancient liberties will be restored to us, burnished even more brightly than before!}
<A>__{brief silence, then a rolling wave of applause. jar jar beams and bows. palpatine rises.}
<C>__{palpatine}
<D>__{it is with great reluctance that i have agreed to this calling. i love democracy... i love the republic. the fact that this crisis is demanding i be given absolute power to tule over you is evident. but i am mild by nature and have no desire to destroy the democratic process. the power you give me i will lay down when this crisis has abated, i promise you. and all i ask in return is when my current term of office is over, you allow me to reture and live out my life in peace.}
<C>__{mas amedda}
<D>__{we shall proceed to the vote. all those in favor of granting emergency powers to the supreme chancellor, signal ate at this time... those opposed?}
