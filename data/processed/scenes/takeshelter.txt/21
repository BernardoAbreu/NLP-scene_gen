<A>__{the reverse lights shine as curtis' pick up rumbles backward. curtis eyes the side mirror as he maneuvers the truck into his backyard. in the mirror, the trash pile comes into view. just behind it, the storm shelter doors appear. the truck shutters to a stop. curtis studies the shelter in the side mirror for a moment. a grassy bulge with angled metal doors peeking over the trash heap. he climbs out. a blue tarp is pulled from the bed of the truck, floating down to the yard. curtis slips on a pair of work gloves and continues to eye the storm shelter. he yanks a bale of chain link from the bed of the truck and carries it to the back corner of the yard. he steals another glance back toward the shelter. dropping the bale, he sizes up the space. he looks to the sky. it's a beautiful day. he begins counting off steps from the back fence line.}
