<L>__{interior shop class day}
<A>__{charlie sits by himself, watching the freshmen boys laugh as a senior paints a goatee on his face with a grease pencil.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{on the bright side, one senior decided to make fun of the teacher instead of the freshmen. he even drew on mr. callahan's legendary goatee with a grease pencil.}
<A>__{meet patrick (18), full of confidence, mischief, and so over high school. he is the class clown, performing a perfect imitation of the teacher, mr. callahan.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{boys, the prick punch is not a toy. i learned that in 'nam back in '68. "callahan," the sergeant said, "put down that prick punch and go kill some gooks."}
<A>__{the laughter suddenly dies as the real mr. callahan (57) walks up behind the oblivious patrick.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{but you know what happened? that prick punch killed my best friend in a saigon whorehouse.}
<A>__{patrick suddenly feels mr. callahan behind him. oops.}

<C>__{mr. callahan}
<D>__{okay... nothing.}
<A>__{the class laughs. except charlie. he watches patrick take the long walk back to his seat.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{i felt really bad for patrick. he wasn't saying the impersonation to be mean or anything. he was just trying to make us freshmen feel better.}
<C>__{mr. callahan}
<D>__{everyone open your safety guides. nothing... why don't you read first?}
<A>__{patrick opens the book.}
