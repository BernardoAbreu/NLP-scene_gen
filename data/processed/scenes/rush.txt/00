<L>__{exterior cloudy sky germany day}
<A>__{dark clouds passing overhead. the bad weather that has hovered over the eifel mountains, (in germany), the past three days is on it's way out.. an eye flickers wide open staring intently a pupil dilates and contracts in the light. the eye stares. blinks. thinks. making evaluations..}

<L>__{interior ferrari day}
<A>__{the eye belongs to a 27 year old formula 1 racing driver wearing a fireproof balaclava... highly intelligent, he also happens to be world champion. his name is painted on the side of his ferrari. niki lauda.}

<D>__{my grandfather always said history is cruel and reductive and no matter how long we live, or how much we achieve we are remembered for very little. so make sure it's the right things.}
<A>__{niki stares up at the clouds. his eyelids flicker. thinking. agonizing. wrestling with an all important decision... is it going to carry on raining? or become dry? should he be using slicks or wets?}
