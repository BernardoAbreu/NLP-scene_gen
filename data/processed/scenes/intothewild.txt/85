<A>__{chris, jan, and rainey are beside a campfire, sitting on blankets. their tents loom behind them. jan is weaving some sort of craft art. chris is chomping on chicken and beans like they're going out of style.}

<P>__{(between large swallows)}
<D>__{so, i just left the car. it was a great car too. i'd driven it cross country the first time when i got out of high school. i had some really great adventures with it. that thing would just go and go. i mean, it was an `82 but if i'd kept it, it would've lasted me forever.}
<C>__{rainey}
<D>__{so, you're a leather now.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i'm a leather?}
<A>__{rainey nods, smiling.}
<C>__{chris }
<P>__{(looking to jan)}
<D>__{what's a leather?}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{you're a leather tramp. that's what they call the ones that hoof it on foot. so, we're technically rubber tramps.}
<C>__{rainey}
<P>__{(interjecting)}
<D>__{as we have a vee hi cle.}
<A>__{rainey makes a move to put his arm around jan. she goes a little stiff and fends it off. chris notices.}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{alex could have a vehicle. if he didn't burn his money. why would you want to do that?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i don't need money. it makes people cautious.}
<C>__{jan}
<P>__{(a little irritated)}
<D>__{well, you have to be a little cautious alex. that book of yours is all well and fine but you can't depend entirely on leaves and berries.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i don't know if you'd want to depend on much more than that.}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{where's your mom and dad?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{makin' their money somewhere.}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{come on chris. you look like a loved kid. be fair.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{fair?}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{you know what i mean.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i will paraphrase thoreau "rather than love, than money, than fairness, give me truth."}
<C>__{rainey}
<D>__{you look like shit. there's the truth.}
<A>__{they all laugh.}
