<A>__{bobby quickly frisks cass, and frisks and disarms milo. he steers the boat one handed up next to the yacht and cuts the motorboats engine. milo makes a sudden lunge for bobby and bobby cracks him over the back of the head with the butt of the gun, sending milo sprawling to the back of the boat, right on top of the motor. milo struggles back up to a seated position.}
