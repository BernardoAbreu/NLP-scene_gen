<C>__{brian}
<D>__{what do you want me to do with }
<A>__{rimgale, now inside, silences him with an outstretched arm.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{ shhh.}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{what are you listening to?}
<A>__{rimgale doesn't answer. his eyes drift over the scorched walls as he speaks softly to them.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{you sneaky little son of a bitch... hide and seek... come on, tell me what i want to know...}
<A>__{he scratches at some soot. smiles and lifts a small hand recorder.}
<C>__{shadow}
<P>__{(business like into recorder)}
<D>__{heavy smoke stains observed in entry room. demarkation line high. fire never got hot enough here to cook soot off. it started somewhere else...}
<P>__{(walks down hall)}
<D>__{less soot here. more heat.}
<P>__{(they enter back room)}
<D>__{and very little soot here.}
<P>__{(to brian)}
<D>__{get that couch out of the way.}
<A>__{brian pulls it aside. the lower third of the wall is completely untouched by soot.}
<C>__{shadow}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{so you were happy here. warm and cozy and in no hurry...}
<P>__{(into recorder)}
<D>__{soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.}
<P>__{(to brian)}
<D>__{find me some glass.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{glass?}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{do we have a language barrier here? glass.}
<A>__{there's some on the sill of a blown window. brian hands a shard to rimgale, who turns it over in his palm.}
<C>__{shadow}
<P>__{(into recorder)}
<D>__{glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. explosion must of come after a slow burn.}
<P>__{(shuts recorder off)}
<D>__{you little tease... what were you up to you little bastard, huh? what made you that mad?}
<P>__{(then, an idea)}
<D>__{or scared.}
<P>__{(switches on recorder)}
<D>__{it started in this room. took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. it couldn't breathe. so it was snuffed. but it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{ another backdraft.}
<A>__{rimgale turns to the wall, a section where the plaster is severely damaged. he probes with a penknife.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{finish coat burned away... severe spawling of rough coat...}
<A>__{rimgale follows the damaged wall down down to a melted wall socket.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{that's our ignition pointerior dig it out. carefully.}
<A>__{brian chops it out from the wall. rimgale crouches down, peels back the melted faceplate and examines the wires. the copper tip is severely melted. rimgale sniffs the plug.}
<C>__{shadow}
<P>__{(into recorder)}
<D>__{temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. an accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{no it couldn't.}
<A>__{rimgale shuts off the recorder. stares down brian.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i mean you'd be right with normal wire. but that's gauge ten in that plug industrial stuff. who knows why they put it in here but it won't melt at less than 12,000 degrees. and no natural spark short of lightning gets that hot.}
<P>__{(rimgale just stares)}
<D>__{in another life i was in high end electronics.}
<A>__{rimgale opens a plastic bag and puts the plug inside.}
<C>__{shadow}
<P>__{(into recorder)}
<D>__{have outlet analyzed for any traces of flammable accelerants.}
<A>__{rimgale stands and walks out.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{don't mention it.}
