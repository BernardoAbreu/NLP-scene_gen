<A>__{a shot of rose in the doorway of the kitchen. she is quite an apparition. she wears bright red lipstick, pink rouge on her cheeks, mascara and her hair is coiffed up in some outlandish manner, but her clothes are the most remarkable thing of all. the skirt is of strange, pink, semi shiny and very thin material and has about a dozen tiny little flowers that could be rosebuds sewed on it. it fits extremely snugly to say the least. the blouse seems a composite: it has frilly white sleeves that are opaque and otherwise is made of filmy white material that is hardly opaque at all. she has no bra and her breasts are half visible, the nipples denting the material. it is pretty wild for 1935. she seems to have on no underwear of any kind; the skirt, which clings to her like a bathing suit, shows no panty seams. she is carrying a shiny black patent leather pocketbook and has on high heel black patent leather shoes and no stockings. an ingenuous little smile is on her face.}

<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(staring down admiringly at the outfit)}
<D>__{i have a knack for designing clothes. but i had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(makes up her mind to defend rose)}
<D>__{well, i think it's charming, rose.}
<P>__{(tactfully)}
<D>__{but don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{oh, no, that's the style. it's meant to be clinging.}
<A>__{we hear the porch door slam. smiling, happy, rose glances around. we hear the sound of the kitchen door opening.}
