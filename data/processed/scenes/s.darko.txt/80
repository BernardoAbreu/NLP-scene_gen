<L>__{exterior intersection near department store afternoon}
<A>__{randy's car is stopped at the red light. sam strolls toward it ever so slowly. jeff, mike and ruth gawk at her from the backseat. she slows down even more, having no interest in subjecting herself to any more of their mockery... the light turns green, and randy's car peels across the intersection, making a left. sam's still 10 or 15 feet away from stepping into the street... she quickens her pace, almost there when ka boom!}
<B>__{from out of nowhere an old jalopy sails right in front}
<A>__{randy's car! he jerks the wheel and the jalopy hits on the front passenger side completely smashing it in sam spins when she hears the deafening crunch... randy careens into the opposite lane, and an oncoming car smacks him dead on. the inertia from the oncoming vehicle plows his car into a fire hydrant by the side of the road. the hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet and skitters harmlessly across the intersection the world goes silent. chris runs toward the destruction, dropping his cigarette...}
<B>__{water erupts like a geyser from the pipe where the hydrant used to be... the jalopy is flipped over onto its side... sam stands peering at the wreckage... the area of the car where corey was sitting is virtually nonexistent. she drops to her knees.}
