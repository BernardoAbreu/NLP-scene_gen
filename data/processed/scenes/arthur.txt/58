<D>__{please, naomi! i didn't mean for it to get to this! i planned to just be your friend but then i started to fall for you and i thought `i can't marry susan, i might fall for naomi!' but i thought `no i have to marry susan or i will be poor so i won't fall for naomi' but then i did fall for you! because you're brainy and funny and gorgeous and too smart to do walking tours. you're too smart, snart. smart snart. there's a 99 cent cereal.}

<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{toad? stay a bit longer. please?}
<C>__{naomi}
