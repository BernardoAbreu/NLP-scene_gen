<L>__{interior boxcar evening}
<A>__{the jolt has awakened several of the children, who gather around helmut in the dimness of the car, frightened and bewildered.}

<D>__{we're moving. what's happening? what was the noise? doork, where are we going?}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(forced gaiety)}

<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{i can't. they want me to stay here.}

<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{but... i will come to see you. soon as i can. and, i want you all to promise me to be very good. no crying.}
<A>__{the children stare at him silently, their eyes unconsciously accusing. with him goes all their security. helmut knows it, but he has no choice. when he reaches the door...}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{if you want me... remember, just close your eyes.}
<A>__{close shot little girl with the dark eyes wordlessly, she shuts her eyes tight. pan shot children following the dark eyed girl's example, the smaller children one by one, close their eyes. close shot helmut near tears with emotion, he wavers. then with great control..}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(huskily)}
<D>__{goodbye.}
<A>__{med. shot helmut he turns and sits down on the floor of the car with his feet hanging outside. he is just about to jump down when he is stopped by a loud wail of anguish from one of the children behind him. he turns and looks back at them. med. shot children helmut's pov a boy of about six, one of the czech youngsters, is crying with the dejection of a lad who has just lost everything. the other little czechs and the older girl who first recognized helmut at the boxcar door are trying unsuccessfully to console him. between cooing and patting the boy's shoulder, the girl throws accusing looks at helmut. wider angle to include helmut uncertain what to do, helmut glances around outside. satisfied that the train isn't going to move at once, he gets up and goes to the children.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{what's this now? crying? after all the fun we've had?}
<A>__{the boy only looks at helmut and goes right on crying. helmut looks helplessly at the older girl.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{it's his birthday. he thought there would be presents.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(to girl)}
<D>__{he's a czech. do you speak...}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{of course not!}
<A>__{helmut is angry with the girl because he really wants to get off the train and yet can't because of the accusing look in her eyes.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{then how do you know it's his... birthday?}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(with typical child logic)}
<D>__{he told me.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{he speaks german?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{but he told you it's his birthday?}
<A>__{the girl nods firmly as do the other children. the boy watches it all, wide eyed. helmut figures to put an end to this.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{what date is this?}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(after thinking it over)}
<D>__{why, it's his birthday!}
<A>__{this is too much for helmut to fathom. he turns his head away, trying to think.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{don't you believe him?}
<A>__{helmut turns back to them, looking first at the girl, then at the boy, his little upturned tear stained face full of wonder. helmut softens, recalling perhaps his own birthday disappointment.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{of course, i do.}
<P>__{(pats boy's head)}
<D>__{tell him i wish him a happy birthday.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{he knows that. but... but what're you going to do about a present?}
<A>__{helmut fans his clothes, finds the harmonica and produces it with a flourish.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{aha, the very thing. he can be the clown while i'm gone.}
<A>__{another angle favoring the czech boy as helmut bows and holds out the harmonica to him.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{happy birthday.}
<A>__{the boy looks solemnly at helmut and the harmonica. he doesn't quite seem to understand what this is all about, but the harmonica is enticing. he looks up at his countrymen for encouragement. they smile at him, and he takes the harmonica, examines it, then blows into it experimentally. when he hears the sound that comes out, he brightens. then the little girl with the rag doll comes forward and offers it to the boy. he looks at her strangely, one of the older german boys scoffs.}
<C>__{german boy}
<D>__{he's a boy! dolls are for girls.}
<A>__{the little girl is hurt, and looks to helmut for support.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{when you give something you love... it doesn't matter if it's the right thing.}
<A>__{he takes the doll and puts one of it's hands in the boy's hand, the other in the little girl's. they stand looking at each other and sharing the doll. helmut looks towards the door apprehensively, but there seems to be no action outside and there are the eyes of the children on him.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{maybe we have time for a birthday game. a quick one. let me take a look.}
