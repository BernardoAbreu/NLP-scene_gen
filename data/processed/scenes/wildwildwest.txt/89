<A>__{rita hasn't even waited for anyone's approval to start eating. west shakes his head at her chutzpa.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{but... i can help you.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{how could you possibly help us?}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{well, i heard you talking about why all those foreign guys were at loveless's party...? you want me to tell you?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{by all means.}
<A>__{she uses the time to get another bite into her mouth.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(to gordon, chewing)}
<D>__{this is fantastic. you can cut it with a fork! how'd you cook it?}
<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(someone appreciates him)}
<D>__{well, in a daubiere... a clay pot. a french method which...}
<A>__{west cuts off the chit chat.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{what about the foreign guys?!}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{they were mad about something, you know? something about a real bad deal in louisiana on purpose.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{the louisiana purchase?}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{and queen somebody somebody of france got swindled.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{queen isabella of spain.}
<A>__{west rolls his eyes.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{gordon, this is crazy. she doesn't know what she's talking about!}
<A>__{west picks up the speaker horn and calls coleman.}
<C>__{west}
<P>__{(into speaker horn)}
<D>__{coleman, stop the train! miss escobar's getting off.}
<C>__{coleman }
<P>__{(over pipe)}
<D>__{who the hell's miss escobar?}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(grabs horn)}
<D>__{i'm a frightened, starving, half naked young woman who only wants to find her father!}
<C>__{coleman }
<P>__{(over pipe)}
<D>__{half naked?}
<C>__{west}
<P>__{(grabs it back)}
<D>__{coleman... stop the train.}
<C>__{coleman }
<P>__{(over pipe)}
<D>__{we're not puttin' anybody off. not out here in the middle of nowhere.}
<A>__{west looks out the window. nothing but sagebrush and animal skulls out there. rita comes up close to jim, fire in her big, brown eyes.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{please, jim. my father's the only family i've got. what am i supposed to do? sit home and wait for news he's been killed? or go do something! what would you do, jim?!}
<A>__{that gets the man of action where he lives.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{look, i got nothing against you, rita. it's just that... what's going to happen when we catch up to loveless... with you on the train?}
<A>__{she grabs west's hand.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{i know you'd never let him take me back. i've seen you shoot.}
<A>__{west kinda melts a little. this girl does have her charms. gordon, a little jealous, puffs his chest out.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{i assure you, rita, an attack by loveless would be an exercise in futility.}
<P>__{(stands for tour)}
<D>__{... allow me to demonstrate how my design suggestions have made the wanderer impervious to attack.}
<A>__{west draws his guns, twirls them and reholsters.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{i'm the impervious part.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{hardly. completely armor plated...}
<A>__{artemus raps his knuckles on the wall making a metallic sound. then he smugly demonstrates that the light fixture is actually a gatling gun.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{an attacker would find the lighting inside extremely... unflattering.}
<A>__{finally he moves to the billiard table, while rita nods ... and keeps eating.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{and if, by some inconceivable fluke, they did manage to gain entrance...}
<P>__{(rolls billiard ball into bumper)}
<D>__{an innocent billiard ball this way.}
<P>__{(picks it up, presses the number)}
<D>__{but depress the number... a sleeping gas bomb. effective in under three seconds.}
<A>__{gordon unclicks it, triumphantly rolls it into a pocket.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{so rest assured, rita... you are completely safe within these walls.}
<A>__{west snorts at his obvious play for rita's attentions.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{i don't know about you, ma'am, but i know i will be sleeping a whole lot better tonight...}
<P>__{(yawns)}
<D>__{... assuming loveless barges in here and feels like a game of pool.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{speaking of sleeping, i'm pretty tired. artemus, do you think i could borrow something to wear?}
<A>__{west jumps in before gordon can answer.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{i've got somethin' you might use. it ain't stylish, but it's practical...}
