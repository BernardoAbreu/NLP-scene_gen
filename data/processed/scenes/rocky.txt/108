<D>__{commentator #1 we would like to welcome our viewing audience to the grand world championship bicentennial heavyweight fight the first major event of the bicentennial year... a point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. i would like to welcome an old friend, and co commentator for this evening's event jimmy michaels. commentator #2 thank you, bob. the electricity is everywhere tonight. rocky balboa, a fifty to one underdog, is living a cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world to quote a popular sports magazine, 'the fighting style should be 'the caveman against the cavalier.' from the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... his record is forty four wins, twenty losses and thirty eight knockouts. commentator #1 i only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds vegas odds say, 'no.'}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{a wedge of uniformed guards knife down the aisle to the ring. many people wish rocky well as he passes... people also hurl insults. from the expression on mickey's face it is also the greatest night of his life. in the audience are familiar faces from the gym. from the back of the arena a roar goes up... apollo creed is in a mock boat dressed like george washington. he throws silver dollars. the noise builds to deafening proportions. creed's trainer holds the rope and creed bounds into the ring. he tears off the washington outfit and it is clearly seen that apollo creed is garbed in an outrageous uncle sam outfit... on his head is a red, white and blue sequined top hat. the robe is sequined red, white and blue. his boxing trunks are red, white and blue silk with stars around the waistband. the boxing shoes match the trunks. on his chin is a pointed white uncle sam beard.}
<D>__{commentator #2 you could go deaf with the noise it undoubtedly means champion apollo creed is heading towards the ring commentator #1 am i seeing right? creed is approaching the ring in a boat. is he supposed to be george washington? obviously so. commentator #2 it's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of george washington a great way to start 1976 off. commentator #1 i agree.}
