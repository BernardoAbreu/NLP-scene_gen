<L>__{interior burned building}
<A>__{brian and the rest of the company rip open the walls and beat the last weak flames in a final flurry of dingy sparks. the moment the smoke clears just a fraction, cigarettes appear in everyone's mouth. was it good for you? the talk is easy and obscene, the intense camaraderie of shared danger. ash clods are thrown playfully back and forth in the afterglow of having taken on the worst there is and walking away one more time.}
