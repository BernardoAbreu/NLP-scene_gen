<L>__{interior jones' office}
<A>__{he leaves the door open and indicates for christine to sit. she does. he paces, working up to what he's going to do.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{you've put us through quite a bit of trouble, mrs. collins. this situation has become an embarrassment for the entire department.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{it wasn't my intention to embarrass anyone.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{no, of course not. you just told the papers we can't tell one boy from another as a compliment for the months we spent working on your case. are you trying to make fools out of us? is that it? do you enjoy this?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{no, of course not. i had to get your attention, i had to make you understand...he's not my son.}
<A>__{he circles, closing in on her. she becomes aware that the door is open, and he's doing this for the benefit of anyone who might be listening in. changeling a true story}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{you know what your problem is? you want to shirk your responsibilities as a mother. you enjoyed being a free woman, didn't you? enjoyed not having to worry about a young son. you could do what you wanted, go where you wanted, see anyone you wanted. but then we found your son. brought him back. and now he's an inconvenience. that's why you cooked up this whole scheme, to try and throw him to the state, let the state raise him for you.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{that's not true!}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{no? even the boy says he's your son. why would he do that? how would he know to do that?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{i don't know! all i know is that he's lying!}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{maybe so. maybe he is a liar. but that's how he's been trained, isn't it? lying was born in both of you. you're a liar and a troublemaker and if you ask me you've got no business walking the streets of los angeles.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{just a minute }
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{because either you know you're lying, or you're not capable of knowing if you're lying or telling the truth. so which is it, mrs. collins? are you a derelict mother? or just nuts? because from where i sit, those are the only options.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{i'm not going to sit here and take this }
<A>__{jones stands between her and the door. changeling a true story}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{you want to bring in experts? doctors? well, i can do that too.}
<P>__{(calling os)}
<D>__{matron?}
<A>__{the door opens, and a police matron enters. he looks back to christine, his voice low, his anger replaced by cool determination. this scene is about to take an abrupt change.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{mrs. collins...do you still insist that the boy out there is not your son?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{he nods to the matron, who moves to restrain her.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{wait...what are you doing?}
<A>__{the matron cuffs christine's hands behind her back.}
<C>__{matron}
<D>__{please don't struggle, ma'am. you'll only hurt yourself.}
<A>__{a click, and the handcuffs are in place.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(to the matron)}
<D>__{you are to convey the prisoner to the los angeles county general hospital psychopathic ward.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{no...wait, you can't }
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(still to matron)}
<D>__{make the following entry in the booking department: defendant states she has been deceived by police and others, and that they have given her a boy and tried to make her think it is her son when she says it is not.}
