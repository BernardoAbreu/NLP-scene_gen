<A>__{the moment has arrived. even the tension of the circumstances cannot distract indy from the purity of what he is about to do. all his calculations are adjustments complete, indy takes the staff of ra and places it clink! in the right depression on the base line. this is as active and exciting a moment as any archeologist can dream of and, at heart, that is exactly what indy is. the sunlight catches the very top of the headpiece and moves within a fraction of an inch of the tiny hole in its sun. the edge of the sunlight moving across the miniature city is still a good two feet beyond the spot belloq has settled on. and now that line of light is broken by the shadow of an ornate sun at the top of the staff. indy's face reflects his concentration. and then his immense pleasure. he sees what he came for. out of the miniature city, one small building is being lit by a tiny beam of sunlight in the center of the shadow of the metal sun. and by some trick of ancient artistry, this one building responds to the sunlight like none of the others. the golden light permeates it: it seems to glow. the building is in a direct line with belloq's all the frenchman's other calculations were right but it is a foot and a half beyond it.}
