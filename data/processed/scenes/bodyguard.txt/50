<L>__{interior family room day}
<A>__{nicki is cutting fruit at the bar. rachel, very tense, is taking the fruit and dropping it into a yogurt drink she's making in a blender. rory, her choreographer, stands behind her, massaging her neck and shoulders. spector is perched on a bar stool like a vulture. devaney hurries into the room; nicki gives him a look.}

<C>__{spector}
<D>__{robin leach, that's who.}
<A>__{rory sniggers into the back of rachel's hair, fighting off a laugh. rachel has difficulty keeping a straight face, too. spector glares at them as frank enters from the sliding door.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{you think that's funny? the man talks to 20 million people and he can't even get in here.}
<C>__{frank}
