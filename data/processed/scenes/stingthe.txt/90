<D>__{keep your mitts off me, ya big lug. if i'da wanted you handlin' me i woulda asked ya.}
<A>__{lonnegan ignores her and proceeds down the passageway. as the woman proceeds in the other direction between passengers, we see it is billie. she drops something on a seat beside a passenger. a hand reaches to pick it up. it is lonnegan's wallet and it is hooker who picks it up. hooker waits a moment, then stands and goes in the direction lonnegan has taken. he passes by the open door to the card room, hesitating only slightly to hear the greetings exchanged inside before the door is shut. then he continues on into the next car. he turns into gondorff's compartment.}
