<C>__{jack }
<D>__{no more haircuts. nothing matters, not even bad breath.}
<A>__{the side of the plane shears off! screaming passengers are sucked out into the night air, flying past the quivering wind. magazines and other objects fly everywhere.}

<A>__{tyler points to passive faces on the drawn figures.}
<C>__{tyler}

<D>__{soap the yardstick of civilization.}
<P>__{(reaches in his pocket)}
<D>__{i make and sell soap...}
<A>__{tyler hands jack his card. "the paper street soap company."}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{if you were to add nitric acid to the soap making process, one would get nitroglycerin. with enough soap, one could blow up the world, if one were so inclined.}
<A>__{tyler snaps the briefcase shut. jack stares.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{tyler, you are by far the most interesting "single serving" friend i've ever met.}
