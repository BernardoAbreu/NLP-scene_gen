<A>__{chuck drops his briefcase and his bag. the place is a jumble of clothes, papers, books, etc. in the living room is a tank of tropical fish. the water looks a little green. no bubbles are coming from the filter. uh oh. chuck walks to the tank. he tightens a piece of tape that holds the power cord onto the filter, taps the filter with his finger, once, twice...the bubbles start again.}

<D>__{damn thing.}
<A>__{but for a couple of fish floating on top of the tank it's too late. chuck gets out his scoop and slowly skims them off.}
