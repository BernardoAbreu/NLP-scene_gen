<A>__{mackelway descends, having had quite enough of this place. piper is where we left him, watching vh1 in the tv room. mackelway passes, eyeing those newly faxed pages: five more have you seen me's... he reaches the door.}
<C>__{piper}
<D>__{ever seen a fifty foot shark?}
<A>__{mackelway stops, turns.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{i'm sorry?}
<C>__{piper}
<D>__{fifty foot shark. ever seen one?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{piper}
<D>__{doesn't mean there aren't any.}
<A>__{great. mackelway reaches for the front door again. then he halts. maybe this guy can be helpful. mackelway turns:}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{did you know him?}

<D>__{the guy who used to stay upstairs. "o'ryan." did you know him?}
<C>__{piper}
<D>__{why? is he dead?}
<C>__{mackelway}

<D>__{you said "did." is he dead?}

<D>__{you know him?}

<C>__{mackelway }
<D>__{he ever talk about this? a circle with a slash through it?}
<A>__{piper rises, crosses to us... leaning in unnecessarily close. it's unsettling.}
<C>__{piper}
<D>__{that's not a circle. it's a zero.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{oh. how do you know?}
<A>__{piper doesn't answer. instead he simply starts whistling. but it's not a tune coming out of his mouth. it's that same sound that o'ryan made: a whistling wind, blowing through a ghost town... building, then falling again. piper smiles, backing away, enjoying the theatricality of it, stifling a giggle... then, suddenly, everything turns grainy, choppy... we've jumped into a distorted, remote pov of this same scene as if watching it through a crystal ball, or a broken lens, or a distance of time and space... we see images, fragments: piper, the tv, the sofa, mackelway's face. then all sound breaks up, and we are...}
