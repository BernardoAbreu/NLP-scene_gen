<D>__{wow! all the books sold at the hardware store?}

<A>__{john claps his hands together. there is a certain spring in his feet.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{didn't i tell you, strudel? write it and they will read.}
<A>__{john can't contain his enthusiasm as he paces the mobile home, his mind racing. sigrid is more composed.}

<D>__{get some more copies down there. maybe do another signing. yeah. no. time for a real tour. fresno. bakersfield. stockton. call a few bookstores. let 'em know john k. butzin is coming. lock and load.}
<A>__{and he's off, leaving the frame, already planning his big adventure, leaving sigrid alone. facing the camera, she nods slightly. then offers us a small wave.}
<C>__{sigrid}
<D>__{bye. bye.}
