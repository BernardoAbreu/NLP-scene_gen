<L>__{exterior baseball diamond day}
<A>__{idyllic. the beautifully manicured field is surrounded by lush woods. standing about forty feet apart, mumford and skip are alone on the field throwing a baseball back and forth. for quite a while the only sounds are the birds, the wind, and the regular slap of ball into glove. finally }
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{this is great!}
<B>__{slap... slap.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{this is exactly what i wanted.}
<B>__{slap... slap.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{you'd be surprised. most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. they're busy. it's not as easy as you think.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. are they busier than you?}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{well, you know... that's the thing. like i said, just about everybody in town works for me. and it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. it's like an order or something... and no one no one asks me.}
<A>__{mumford considers. slap... slap... slap.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{so, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... is your problem really that you're... lonely?}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{don't you like this?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{hell yes, i like it. what's better than this? most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{okay then.}
<P>__{(slap... slap)}
<D>__{have you got a lot of friends?}
<C>__{mumford}
<P>__{("nope")}
<D>__{lily and i talk a bit. you know lily, runs the coffee shop?}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{no... i've seen her. good looking woman.}
<C>__{mumford}
<P>__{(agrees)}
<D>__{she's probably ten years older than you.}
<C>__{skip}
<P>__{(slap... slap)}
<D>__{good looking woman.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{lives downstairs from me. she's got a great dog named for danny ainge.}
<C>__{skip}
<P>__{(sparks to that)}
<D>__{really? i'm the only person i know that likes danny ainge, outside of celtic fans. maybe phoenix.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{well, there's lily.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{did you know that danny ainge was drafted by the blue jays? do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the nba and in the bigs?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{amazing.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{unbelievable...}
<P>__{(slap... slap)}
<D>__{...and lily named her dog after him? far out.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{what kind of person do you have to be to do this?}
<A>__{mumford gestures off in the one direction we have not yet seen.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{this }
