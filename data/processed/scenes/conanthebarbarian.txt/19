<L>__{exterior cliff face day}
<A>__{lucius and the aquilonians race up to a sheer cliff face. nowhere left to run. they turn to see the cimmerians gathering in front of them.}
<C>__{uran}
<D>__{death is in the air, invaders. can you taste it?}
<C>__{lucius}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{indeed. i savor it.}
<A>__{uran notices something is wrong. his eyes go skyward. atop the cliff stand cheren and a dozen more of his blind archers, bows at the ready with flaming arrows. they let the arrows fly, streaking balls of flame heading right for the cimmerians. but they do not hit them. they hit the tree trunks beside them. and for a moment, the cimmerians look relieved, until they notice small bags of a black substance tied to the arrows. the flames lick at the substance kaboom! the forest erupts into flames as the cimmerian warriors are burned alive.}
