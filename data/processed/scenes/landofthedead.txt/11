<L>__{exterior dead reckoning night}
<A>__{...riley, charlie, and mike step out of a vehicle the size of a city bus. the words dead reckoning are painted on its side. this is no bus. it's a war wagon, built of scavenged parts with a riveted steel skin. gattling guns protrude from a mean looking snout. a roof turret supports two fourteen inch cannons. rotating lights shine in all directions, piercing the night. thoomb! thoomb! thoomb! that sound again. mortar tubes on the vehicle's roof are launching fireworks that burst in the sky.}

<C>__{riley}
<D>__{looks like nobody's hit it before.}
