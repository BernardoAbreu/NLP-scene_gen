<L>__{exterior interior acclaim at jimmy's garage lot day}
<A>__{ray and lila pull into a used car lot surrounded by a chain link fence. there is no sign of life. ray stops.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{honk the horn.}
<A>__{ray honks. suddenly, from under a gutted truck, a huge black dog, part wolf, springs onto the hood of the acclaim. ray is pinned against her seat at the sight of the dog. lila grabs the gun out of her hand and points it at ray.}
<C>__{lila }
<D>__{just keep your mouth shut.}
<A>__{ray stares at the snarling dog.}
<C>__{lila }
<D>__{just keep it shut. okay?}
<A>__{ray nods never taking her eyes off the dog. lila honks the horn again and keeps the gun low and out of sight. out of the garage comes jimmy, 33, a stocky mohawk, eating a sandwich. jimmy looks suspiciously at ray before he sees lila. thunder growls.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{thunder! shut up!.}
<A>__{the dog growls ferociously at ray.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{get back under there!}
<A>__{thunder jumps off the hood and disappears back under the trunk. jimmy walks around to the passenger side of the car. lila rolls down her window.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{hi, jimmy.}
<A>__{jimmy glances at ray.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{he don't like whites, lila.}
<C>__{lila}

<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{and your late.}

<D>__{i shouldn't even be dealing with you.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i know. sorry.}
<A>__{he hands her a paper bag. jimmy goes back to the garage and opens the door. two young chinese men in cheap jogging suits follow him out, looking around.}
