<L>__{interior bedroom}
<A>__{jill enters. john is still asleep facing the wall. jill gets into bed, sitting up. she is wide awake now. she sits for a moment in the darkness, thinking. then she reaches for the princess phone on the bedside table. she doesn't get a dial tone. she quietly pushes the phone's disconnect button up and down several times. still no dial tone. jill hangs up and thinks for another moment, apprehension creeping over her face. then, in the darkness of the bedroom, she begins to hear the muttering of a man's voice, low and deep. it is duncan in the throes of guy du marraux. jill freezes. as the voice gets steadily louder and more menacing, her attention focuses on the door to the bedroom closet which is a couple of inches ajar.}

<D>__{john?... john?...}
<A>__{she reaches for the bedside lamp and turns it on, never taking her eyes away from the closet door. as soon as the light comes on, the voice stops. her eyes still riveted to the door, jill grabs her husband's shoulder and shakes him, her voice cracking with fear.}

<D>__{john!... john!...}
<A>__{the body beside her stirs, rolls over, looks at her hideously. it is duncan!! jill shrieks, and makes a move to leap out of the bed. duncan, the hideous and terrifying sound of his madness grumbling out of his throat, manages to grab the back of her nightgown. as jill struggles to get off the bed, the gown rips slightly while she fights to get away. duncan rolls to her side of the bed and manages to grab jill's ankle while letting go of the gown. it causes jill to lose her balance and tumble onto the floor just short of the doorway leading out of the room. duncan is on her in a flash, clutching at her and moving his hands for her throat. jill screams again. it is the desperate sound of a woman facing certain death. suddenly, two quick shots ring out, overwhelming all other sound. duncan falls back with a groan and a thud. out of the darkness of the hallway steps clifford, pistol in hand. he crosses to duncan. he is dead. then clifford walks around the room to the far side of the bed and looks down. on the narrow strip of floor between the bed and the wall lies john. clifford nudges the body with his foot. john stirs, as if he has been knocked unconscious, but it will be some time yet before he comes to. clifford starts to walk out of the room, stepping over duncan's body, edging past jill who is propped up in the doorway, sobbing hysterically.}

<A>__{jill clutches her children to her heaving breast and buries her face between them.}
