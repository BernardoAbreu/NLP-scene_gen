<L>__{int large, dark room night}
<A>__{in the ebony shadows of a large room we can make out corners and edges, moldings and cornices; the phantoms of decaying victorian wealth floating like disembodied ghosts in the darkness. it is may 6, 1924 the harsh flare of a match being struck a shadowy male figure lights a series of nine candles on a birthday cake. beyond the cake we can see a bed. on the bed lies a woman in her early forties. she is ashen and sickly. dying. the shadowy male figure finishes lighting the candles, blows out the match and disappears as the woman peers into the darkness.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{come into the light.. come into the light}
<A>__{a nine year old boy steps into the light. she pulls him close and whispers:}
<C>__{woman}
<A>__{never stand in the shadows }
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{mother...}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you are made for the light, orson now you must blow out your candles. but you must always remember, the cake itself is nothing. the flame, the lights, that is where your future lies. you must have a dream. a great dream worthy of you.}
<A>__{the boy immediately spins to the cake and blows out the candles. a moment of darkness. he turns back to the bed. the woman and the bed are gone, faded into darkness. the solemn young lad stares and stares into the darkness and then, magically, the faint glimmer of twinkling stars fill his huge dark eyes. newsreel the flickering images of an old newsreel, circa 1940 under the mgm logo we see the title: boy wonder wows hollywood! the first image after the title is the imposing figure of orson welles, climbing down from an airplane and surveying the world at his feet. welles is 24 years old and somewhat handsome. welles seems rather uncomfortable in his own body, as if it could not possibly contain his vast passions and appetites. orson welles is man who tears his way through life with incendiary energy. he is at once inspiring and ferocious; visionary and coldly ambitious. he is part artist, part fraud and all showman. a sonorous voice accompanies the newsreel. the voice is always grand, occasionally sardonic.}
<C>__{newsreel voice}
<D>__{he came to the town of magic and dreams a flashing star blazing through the firmament of illusion. and he promised to devour the world in a single gulp. he was 24 years old and his name was george orson welles. sound the trumpets! unfurl the banners, hollywood! the boy wonder has arrived!}
<A>__{images of welles as a baby and his early life fill the screen: welles in a crib; as a pampered schoolboy; at dance class; drama club; dressed up for a magic show. as we hear:}
<C>__{newsreel voice}
<D>__{he made his debut on the world stage in kenosha, wisconsin, on the 6th of may, 1915. and on the 7th of may he spoke his first words, and unlike other children who say commonplace things like "momma" and "poppa", he proclaimed "i am a genius!"}
<A>__{at three the genius was reciting shakespeare and at eight he had taken up cigars and highballs and was learning magic from the knee of the great houdini. images of welles' early theatrical career: the young man playing impossibly old parts; vaudeville magic shows; various regional theaters; endless tawdry rehearsal rooms then images of welles and john houseman in new york: the great, bustling city; welles at work with john houseman on a script; welles directing a play. as we hear:}
<C>__{newsreel voice}
<D>__{so how could the magic of the stage not call to this adventurous lad? unstoppable and resolute, the boy wonder journeyed into the world of the legit theater. after a peripatetic beginning he found himself at last in new york where he joined forces with theatrical producer john houseman under the august auspices of the wpa federal theater.}

<C>__{newsreel voice}

<A>__{more images of new york, welles, houseman and radio: welles directing a radio play with sweeping energy; supervising the elaborate sound effects; editing the script; at odds with houseman. as we hear:}
<C>__{newsreel voice}
<D>__{though he wowed the critics with his spectaculars the ticket sales left something to be desired. so, after founding the mercury players with houseman, young mr. welles quickly set his sights on the airwaves. he quickly became the sonorous ' voice of "the shadow." ''}

<C>__{newsreel voice}
<D>__{the war of the worlds sent this nation spinning into a frenzy. nine million listeners clasped their loved ones close and looked to the skies with horror. unlucky listeners near the epicenter of the "invasion" rural new jersey ran screaming into the night, sure a monstrous alien and a fiery death awaited them around every corner! the mischievous boy wonder had fooled us all!}

<B>__{schaefer}
<A>__{schaefer is an intense, compact man in his early 50's. his nickname in hollywood is "the tiger" both for his admired tenacity and his feared temper. he is a moral and ethical man; john adams in a brooks brothers suit. as we hear}

<D>__{eyebrows raised and jaws dropped all over hollywoodland when the terms of the deal that lured the great orson came forth: the boy wonder could produce, write, direct and star in his own projects with budgets up to $500,000 a picture! he would have total control over the shooting of the picture and the finished product. the studio, well, they just paid the bills. meanwhile, the insiders of filmland were skeptical.}
<A>__{an interview with a hollywood insider, who looks like a bookie:}
<C>__{hollywood insider}

<A>__{shots of welles with louella parsons and hedda hopper louella is a much feared gossip columnist. she is a gorgon in her 60's; margaret dumont possessed by the devil and tanked up on gin. her capricious cruelty is only matched by her fervent loyalty to all things hearstian. hedda is a gossip columnist in her 50's. she is given to elaborate hats and villainous intrigue. louella's younger, smarter rival, hedda probably spends her spare time eating children. then a snippet of an interview with louella:}

<A>__{"the end" and newsreel credits the newsreel sputters to a stop in a screening room. a shaft of light shines on a large mgm logo on one wall. another shaft of light illuminates the sitting figure of louis b. mayer. mayer is a short, crafty, bespectacled man in his 50's. his cloying, avuncular exterior only fleetingly disguises the film titan's outrageous barbarism. another shadowy figure, a mayer flunkie, can be just glimpsed sitting elsewhere in the screening room. mayer glowers at the darkened screen for a moment. a beat.}
<C>__{mayer}
<D>__{who does that cocksucker think he is?}
<C>__{flunkie}
<D>__{they're laying bets over on the rko lot that this great deal will end up with him never doing a picture. back to new york he goes.}

<D>__{serves him right. i mean can you stomach the arrogance?}
<C>__{flunkie}
<D>__{inside skinny says the glory boy's finished, can't come up with a movie. wants to do a biography now.}
<C>__{mayer}
<D>__{after rko boots him maybe we'll pick him up cheap. have him do that war of the worlds crap as a feature.}
