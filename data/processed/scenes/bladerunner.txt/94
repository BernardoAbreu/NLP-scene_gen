<L>__{interior deckard's bedroom night}
<A>__{books scattered on the bed. rachael sitting cross legged with one in her lap, looking through exquisite shots of nature. deckard is next to her, watching her like a lover, like a father.}
<C>__{deckard }
<D>__{she'd never seen the great outdoors. never even seen books on the subject. she went through everything i had, and we talked. and there were subjects we didn't discuss and they were words we didn't say, i couldn't say, like death, like future, like real. but it was hard because she was curious and full of questions. she was more alive than anyone i'd ever known.}
<A>__{she looks up stunned by the beauty of a photo, but with no need to comment. it's in her eyes. she stares at him, a revelation taking shape.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{you and i are good friends, huh?}
<A>__{he considers it and she stares at him, smiling at the wonder of it.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{it's so easy.}
<A>__{convinced and not convinced, he nods his head. she laughs at his solemnity. she's irresistible. deckard's pretty irresistible himself.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{have you ever known anybody a long time?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{you mean a woman?}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{what's a long time?}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{ten years.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{nope. nobody could stand me that long.}
<A>__{the chime on the phone next to the bed goes off. he reaches out and brings it to his ear.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{bryant}
<D>__{this is bryant. are you alone?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{bryant}
<D>__{she's not with you?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{who.}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{bryant}
<D>__{take a number. canapt 1700, tenth floor, villa vita district, olympia south.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{got it.}
<C>__{bryant}
<D>__{okay, here it is. eldon tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred. the cat is about to get out of the bag. pressure is definitely on. the nexus program is terminated. when you finish there, locate nexus designated rachael and retire.}
<A>__{deckard says nothing.}
<C>__{bryant}
<D>__{if you don't, we will. it has to be total, deckard. that's an order from as high as it comes. got it?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{yeah. i got it.}
<C>__{bryant}
<D>__{go.}
<A>__{he hangs up the receiver and gets up. she watches him from the bed. the gun goes into his belt. he loads the ankle job and straps it on. she watches every move.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{because it's not.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{andies only simulate suffering if they're programmed for it.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{do you think i simulated what happened between us?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{no, i don't.}
<A>__{without looking at her, he puts on his jacket. he's standing in the middle of the floor with his back to her. he turns and they're facing one another. neither of them moves.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{don't leave here. don't open the door, don't answer the phone.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{what difference will it make?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{just wait here.}
<A>__{he goes to the door.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{you know what i think?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{that some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.}
<A>__{he has to laugh.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{you know what else i think?}
<C>__{decakrd}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{this was the best day of my life.}
<A>__{he turns and goes through the door.}
