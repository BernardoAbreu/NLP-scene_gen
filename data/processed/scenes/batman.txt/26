<L>__{interior bruce wayne's library night}
<C>__{knox }
<D>__{... we found the arsenal.}
<A>__{one wall is lined to the ceiling with leather bound volumes. on the other walls hang exotic weapons. halberds. maces. blowguns. bolas. thugee ropes and samurai swords... every arcane implement of death the human mind has ever devised. knox lets out a low whistle.}
<C>__{knox }
<D>__{this guy has just gotten interesting. what else do you know?}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{just what i've heard. rich. reclusive. old money and lots of it.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{likes to kill?}
<C>__{vicki}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{women find him magnetic.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{i bet they like him for his big charity balls.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{that, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{well, you know me. the more they've got, the less they're worth.}
<P>__{(scanning the room)}
<D>__{this guy must be the most worthless man in america.}
<A>__{just then, a voice from behind intrudes.}
<C>__{bruce wayne}
<D>__{you disappoint me. why not the world?}
<A>__{knox turns. we get our first good look at the smiling face of bruce wayne: 32, tall, athletic, impeccably mannered... and intensely handsome.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{i assume in my usual charming manner i've just insulted the host.}
<P>__{(extending a hand)}
<D>__{alexander knox.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{bruce wayne. i've read your work. i quite like it.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{great. give me a grant.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i might consider it if you introduce me to miss vale.}
<A>__{knox blinks at vicki. bruce already seems to know who she is. knox shrugs and forges bravely ahead:}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{"this is miss vale." that felt redundant.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(to vicki)}
<D>__{you're just back from corto maltese. i saw your combat photos. quite a departure for you.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{that's intriguing. they haven't been published yet.}
<A>__{bruce smiles and ignores the implied question.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{... you have an extraordinary eye.}
<A>__{he's laying on the charm now. knox, his territorial instincts aroused, pipes up:}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{some people think she has two.}
<A>__{vicki shoots knox a sidelong glance:}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{don't mind my friend. he's a little nervous tonight.}
<A>__{knox, chastened, calls off the dogs and sizes up his competition. bruce is charming, all right, but there's something formal, maybe even calculating about it he could be reading his clever remarks off cue cards. it's almost as though he's an actor doing a brilliant imitation of charm. this is a man who thinks three moves ahead. knox doesn't like him. but vicki who's used to seeing male charm turned on and off, at will doesn't seem to mind at all:}
<C>__{vicki }
<D>__{this is an amazing house. i'd love to shoot it sometime.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i don't... seek publicity. will you be staying in gotham for a while?}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{as far as i know.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{good. then with any luck we'll run into each other.}
<A>__{suddenly alfred, the butler, appears in the doorway behind them. he clears his throat. bruce turns.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{excuse me, sir. commissioner gordon was compelled to leave very unexpectedly. he asked me to convey his regrets.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{thank you, alfred.}
<P>__{(to vicki)}
<D>__{i hope you'll excuse me. it was a great pleasure meeting you.}
<P>__{(to knox)}
<D>__{and you.}
<A>__{without bothering to shake hands bruce does a sharp 180 and strides hurriedly out of the room.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{i know the rich are different, but that guy is real different.}
<A>__{vicki, staring off after bruce, doesn't seem to hear him.}
<C>__{knox }
<D>__{hello? vicki?}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{oh. sorry. i was thinking.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{what were you thinking?}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{yum, yum.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{well, he must like the way he looks. he's got a mirror in every room.}
<A>__{and indeed, the two of them are standing before an enormous wall mirror, eight feet wide, running from floor to ceiling.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{i get it. bruce vain.}
<A>__{she pokes knox. he groans at the dumb pun. and suddenly we}
