<D>__{you seem eminently suited to this post but i wonder if you could explain the gaps in your employment record?}
<C>__{renton}
<D>__{yes, i can. the truth well, the truth is that i've had a long standing problem with heroin addiction. i've been know to sniff it, smoke it, swallow it, stick it up my arse and inject it into my veins. i've been trying to combat this addiction, but unless you count social security scams and shoplifting, i haven't had a regular job in years. i feel it's important to mention this.}
<A>__{there is silence. a paper clip crashes to the floor. }
