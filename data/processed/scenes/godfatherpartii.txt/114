<L>__{interior state senate floor day}
<A>__{the senate is in session; senator geary is on the floor during a vote. an aide approaches him, with a slip of paper.}
<L>__{interior geary's office day}
<A>__{the senator steps behind his desk.}
<C>__{senator geary}
<D>__{all right, mr. hagen, you've got ten minutes.}
<A>__{he flicks the switch of a small tape recorder.}
<C>__{senator geary}
<D>__{...and the tape will be running.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{actually, i've come with good news; the corleone family has done you a favor.}
<A>__{the senator immediately shuts the tape recorder off.}
<C>__{senator geary}
<D>__{what the hell are you talking about?}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{we know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did. no strings.}
<C>__{senator geary}
<D>__{no strings.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{you know there's a senate investigating committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though provoking to your name.}
<C>__{senator geary}
<D>__{no one can trace anything to me; i pride myself on that.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{do you gamble?}
<C>__{senator geary}
<D>__{a little; what's so thought provoking about that?}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{do you owe markers?}
<C>__{senator geary}
<D>__{maybe two, three thousand dollars.}
<A>__{hagen leans forward, and deposits a handful of paper on the senator's desk.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{the corleone family has paid them off for you...as an expression of our esteem.}
<A>__{geary quickly looks through the paid markers.}
<C>__{senator geary}
<D>__{there's thirty grand worth of paid off markers i never owed that much.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{our mistake. but what does it matter; it was our money.}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{we don't even expect thanks.}
<C>__{senator geary}
<D>__{you paid off thirty grand i never owed.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{we'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the committee needn't find out.}
<C>__{senator geary}
<D>__{and what's the price of their not finding out.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{simple. be friendly like us. not hostile.}
<C>__{senator geary}
<P>__{(he despises hagen)}
<D>__{thanks...friend.}
