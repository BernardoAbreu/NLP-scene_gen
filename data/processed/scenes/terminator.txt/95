<A>__{several angles, on glistening arms, legs, torsos merging into bio mechanical kinetic sculptures with the chrome steel levers and tubes. the crash and squeal of metal against metal. in f.g., two conan esque arms thrust upward, glistening. ginger's boyfriend, matt mccallister, the assistant manager of the club, strains out his last reps, bench pressing enormous weight on the nautilus machine. despite his imposing appearance, matt is one of the warmest people you'd ever want to meet. his face is contorted, muscles knotted for the last push. he heaves it up with a guttural cry. lowering his weights with a clang, matt lies panting, arms dangling at his side, eyes closed. a pair of female legs appear.}

<A>__{she leans down as he sits up and they meet in a kiss that's bad for the other guys' discipline. sarah waits until they break the clinch to speak.}
