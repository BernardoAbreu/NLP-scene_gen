<L>__{interior tsai's house night (later)}
<A>__{may fans a small coal fired grill that is boiling a sizzling pot of vegetable and meatball soup. her father and bo are now friendly dinner companions, much to may's delight.}
<C>__{tsai}
<D>__{i don't care about your sword.}
<C>__{bo}
<D>__{why were you spying on the yus?}
<C>__{tsai}
<D>__{i'm looking for someone. jade fox. i'm a police inspector from shaan xi, gen su district. jade fox is a master criminal. i hear she infiltrated the yus. she must have come with them when they transferred here. but with yu's reputation, i can't just go in and accuse her.}
<C>__{bo}
<D>__{this jade fox is a woman?}
<C>__{tsai}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{bo}
<D>__{then leave her to me.}
<C>__{tsai}
<D>__{pardon me, but i doubt you can handle her. my wife was quite a martial arts expert. jade fox killed her. so you see, this is personal. leave her to me.}
<C>__{may}
<D>__{it's ready!}
<P>__{(re: the soup)}
<C>__{bo}
<D>__{i'm ready for anything!}
<A>__{bo fishes into the pot with his chopsticks. may intercepts him with her own chopsticks.}
<C>__{may}
<D>__{father gets first dip.}
<A>__{tsai stiffens and snaps his chopsticks, not to pick up a meatball but to catch an incoming dart. a dart wrapped with a note. bo jumps up.}
<C>__{tsai}
<D>__{they're gone.}
<C>__{may}
<D>__{what does it say?}
<C>__{tsai}
<D>__{"we'll settle this at midnight on yellow hill." good, the fox is out of her hole.}
