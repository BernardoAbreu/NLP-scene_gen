<A>__{we tilt up the chrome and glass facade of the skyscraper, arriving finally at the top floor: a plate glass window spiderwebbed with cracks where jack's bullets hit.}

<A>__{he reaches for a nearby glass of liquor and glances down at grissom who lies dead on the floor, the towel still wrapped around him. the joker laughs softly to himself.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{guess it's my little city now. wonder what it'll look like when i get done with it.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i bet it'll be something real fine. real fine and pretty.}
