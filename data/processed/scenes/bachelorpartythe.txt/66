<A>__{charlie moves down the stairs into the living room proper. he makes his way to eddie, who is still sitting in the back of the room, throwing an intense pitch at his girl, talking quickly, smiling, gesturing.}

<D>__{wait a minute, i will go with you.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't want to take you away from your girl, eddie.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{aah, this one lives out in long island with her mother. what kind of communist is that? it'll take me a half hour on the subway there and a half hour back.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{where's arnold? still in the kitchen?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i guess so.}

<A>__{he starts off after charlie who is already wandering through the living room in the general direction of the kitchen, looking about for arnold. they pass the existentialist en route. she is saying: "... this boy named charlie, i never saw him before in my life, has been clutching at me all evening. he's absolutely insane about me." charlie leans into the kitchen where arnold is awake now, seated at the small kitchen table, staring gauntly, unseeingly at his fingers on the white porcelain topped table. there are two men, one middle aged, one young, having a whispered chat over the sink.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(over charlie's shoulder)}
<D>__{hey, arnold, come on.}
<A>__{arnold stands obediently, almost dumbly. he squeezes around the table, his face soddenly expressionless, to join eddie and charlie in the kitchen doorway. eddie is saying to charlie:}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{well, it wasn't a bad party. we killed a couple of hours anyway.}
<A>__{the three men push their way past three women in their thirties, who are standing in the little hallway before the front door, in earnest brow furrowed conversation with each other. charlie opens the door, and the three morose carousers go out into the dark street.}
