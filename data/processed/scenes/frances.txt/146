<L>__{interior steilacoom night}
<A>__{we see harry and the other man, now wearing a white doctor's coat, walking quickly down a dim hallway. they come to a large door with a barred window. the man fiddles with a keyring and unlocks the door. they enter. we hear the door lock behind them.}
<L>__{interior ward night}
<A>__{just inside the door the doctor flicks on a flashlight and they walk down the center of the room. the beam of light sweeps over women patients in their cots, crammed side by side. some are asleep, others stare blankly at the ceiling. a few smile invitingly at the two men, whispering obscenities. the light falls on a bedraggled woman hunched over in a corner between the wall and a cot. it is frances. harry goes to her, putting his arms around her. she is very heavily sedated. tears spring to harry's eyes.}

<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{the hearing's tomorrow. if she gets out legally, they can't come after her.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{look at her! she'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i'm taking care of that, harry. just hold her.}
<P>__{(pulling a hypodermic from his pocket)}
<D>__{reserpine. i guarantee you this'll clear her head. she'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.}
<A>__{harry holds her around the shoulders and straightens out her arm. frances starts to struggle and moan loudly.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{yeah... she knows about these. shut her up.}
<A>__{harry glares at the doctor, but puts a hand over her mouth and the doctor injects her. her arm is covered with sores.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(tenderly)}
<D>__{you'll be okay, honey. he's just givin' you something to make you think, so that tomorrow you can tell 'em what they want to hear, okay? tell 'em you were crazy as a loon and they cured you and you're grateful.}
<A>__{the doctor withdraws the hypo and massages her arm.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{this stuff takes pretty quick. let's go.}
<C>__{frances}
