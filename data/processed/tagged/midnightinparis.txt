<D>__{the twenties are full of strife and uncertainty. but think of it, gil the two of us in a lovely art nouveau home i will work in the fashion world i love the styles you can write it's the age of debussy and guimard. maybe you can meet balzac.}

<D>__{and even in the twenties no dishwashers no 911 if your appendix bursts no "movies on demand"}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{but if we love each other what does it matter when we live?}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{because if you stay here and this becomes your present, sooner or later you'll imagine another time was really the golden time. and so will i i'm beginning to see why it can't work, adriana. the present has a hold on you because it's your present and while there's never any progress in the most important things, you get to appreciate what little progress is made the internet pepto bismol. the present is always going to seem unsatisfying because life itself is unsatisfying that's why gauguin goes back and forth between paris and tahiti, searching it's my job as a writer to try and come up with reasons why despite life being tragic and unsatisfying, it's still worth it.}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{that's the problem with writers you're all so full of words but i'm more emotional. i'm going to stay and live in paris' most glorious time. you made a choice to leave paris once and you regretted it.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{yes, that one i regretted but it was a real choice and i made the wrong one. this is a choice between accepting reality or surreal insanity.}
