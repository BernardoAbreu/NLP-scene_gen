<A>__{she smiles at him. he smiles back, about ready to stick her in the trunk of her car.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{look, i'm beginning to lose my sense of humor about }
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{let's cut through the bullshit, stan. if you ever want to have a chance in hell of getting your daughter back you'll shut up and listen. unless of course you want to stay here in your pathetic, loser life while she learns what it's like to be a fluffer in one of her new daddy's videos.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{do me the courtesy of not confusing your own childhood with my daughter's.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{look at your situation, stanley. for twenty months you've been in court six times, each time your custody case has been thrown out. your situation doesn't look good, sweetheart.}
<A>__{she blows smoke at him, thinking, then whips out her trump card.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{how much would it cost to retain the best family lawyer in the country and regain custody of your daughter?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{all the way through the jury trial?}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{a lot.}
<A>__{she pulls out a large manila envelope. opens it and dumps the rubber banded stacks of hundreds onto the ground.}

<D>__{this should get you started.}
<A>__{stanley just stares at the money. he looks up at ginger.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{whattaya have to lose? just meet him. one time. that's it. you don't like the setup, walk away.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{that's it?}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{that's it. and you keep the money.}
<A>__{she smokes, letting it all sink in. she puts out her cigarette. they just stare at each other. she smiles.}
