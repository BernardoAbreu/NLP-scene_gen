<L>__{40: exterior quay harbor. humboldt bay. day.}
<A>__{seagulls and sunshine and probably saturday because the place is busy. ross walks with berlin up a wooden quay. their journ ey will take them across a small bridge towards a marine shop.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the m.o.'s exactly the same. dark hair. no hands. all shot with a high velocity twen ty two in the back of the head.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{how come the f.b.i. don't put anya this together? they work ed over "jennifer" for months?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{they possibly did but they nev er had a head, so they never had a bullet and they never got an i.d. not on any of em never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is we're the first to get a positive identity.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{identity of whom? you got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic ense? .. she's untraceable, john .. you need fifty detectives on this.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{that's what i'm here for. i want you to come and see citrine with me? he's not gonna here it from me but i know he'd listen to you.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{listen to me saying what?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i wanna take that fucking blind in stitute to pieces .. every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{for a dead dog?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{we've fused into a major series, ross. this girl isn't the second victim. this is "jennifer eight."}
<A>__{and this is the second time they stop and stare at each other.}
<D>__{that old wino on the heap wasn't a suicide. he stumbled into some thing, saw something, and whoever took him out knew how to fake it.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{that isn't what you said before.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i was wrong.}
<A>__{says it with remarkable humility considering he's the "expert."}
<D>__{i'm going in to see citrine this afternoon. will you come with me?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{you're not .. he's in hospital .. he was trying out a new pair of skis in his hallway. the phone rings, and he goes for it, and falls off. he must be the only skier in northern california to break a leg in his living room.}
<A>__{they arrive at the chandler's with berlin in no mood to smile.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{you believe me, don't you?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{what does it matter what i bel ieve? .. what you gotta worry about is what citrine believes ..}
<A>__{but he doesn't really believe it. and doesn't enjoy saying no.}
<D>__{but i can't help you with this. we can't go through the door with two contentious issues, you with a mass murderer, and me with the mayor's best friend. do that, we lose both. i'm sorry, bro, you're on your own.}
