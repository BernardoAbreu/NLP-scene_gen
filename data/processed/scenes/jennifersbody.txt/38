<A>__{the sound of jonas's parents screaming carries across the lake. the water is eerily calm. suddenly, a head breaks the surface of the lake. it's jennifer, gliding through the water. she looks calm and serene. the screaming continues across the lake. the sirens, shouting and chaos contrast sharply with this peaceful scene. jennifer paddles to the shore and hoists herself onto the pier, naked and dripping wet. she runs her tongue over her teeth briefly and nonchalantly picks something out from between her two front teeth, like she's just finished a delicious rib dinner. jennifer wrings out her sopping hair and reaches for her clothes, which are neatly folded on the pier. once she's dressed, she walks off into the woods, as if nothing out of the ordinary has happened.}
