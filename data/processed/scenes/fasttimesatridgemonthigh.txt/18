<L>__{interior u.s. history class day}
<A>__{stacy barely slips in the door before the final attendance bell sounds. she finds a seat just as the teacher's cubicle door opens at the back of the classroom. a tall figure comes barreling down the aisle. he is mr. hand. the man makes a double speed step to the door at the front of the class, kicks the door shut and locks it. the windows rattle in their frames. stacy watches, wide eyed, at her first high school class.}
<C>__{mr. hand}
<D>__{aloha. my name is mr. hand.}
<A>__{mr. hand writes his name on the green chalkboard before his class. every letter is a small explosion of chalk.}
<C>__{mr. hand }
<P>__{(almost sweetly)}
<D>__{i have but one question for you on our first morning 'together.'}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{can you attend my class? pakalo?... understand?... history has proven us one basic fact. man does not do anything that is not for his own good. it is for your own good that you attend my class. and if you can't make it... i can make you.}
<A>__{an impatient knock begins at the front door of the classroom.}
<C>__{mr. hand }
<D>__{we have a twenty question quiz every friday. it will cover all the material we've dealt with during the week. there will be no make up exams. it's important that you all have your land of truth and liberty textbooks by wednesday. at the latest.}
<A>__{the knock continues.}
<C>__{mr. hand }
<D>__{your grade is the average of all your quizzes, plus the midterm and final, which counts for one third. got it?}
<A>__{the mystery knocker tries a lazy calypso beat on the front door. no one in mr. hand's u.s. history class dares mention it, much less answer it. stacy grips her desk with the tension of her first day.}
<C>__{mr. hand }
<D>__{also. there will be no eating in this class. you get used to doing your own business on your own time. that's one demand i make. i don't like staying after class with you on detention. that's my time. i don't like wasting it. just like you wouldn't want me to come to your house some evening and discuss u.s. history on your time. pakalo?}
<A>__{hand finally turns, as if he has just noticed the sound at the door and opens the door an inch. jeffrey spicoli stands in the doorway, red eyes glistening. his long, blond hair is still wet and streaming down the back of his white peasant shirt. he grins, oblivious to such trivial matters as attendance bells. a student sitting near stacy turns to his friends.}
<C>__{student}
<D>__{that guy has been stoned since the third grade.}
<C>__{mr. hand}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{yeah. i'm registered for this class.}
<C>__{mr. hand}
<D>__{what class?}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{this is u.s. history, right? i saw the globe in the window.}
<C>__{mr. hand}
<P>__{(appears enthralled)}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{spicoli holds his red ad card up to the crack in the door.}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{can i come in?}
<C>__{mr. hand}
<P>__{(swinging door open)}
<D>__{oh, please. i get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and i don't see all my kids here.}
<A>__{spicoli laughs. he is the only one.}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{sorry i'm late. this new schedule is totally confusing.}
<A>__{mr. hand takes the red ad card and reads from it with utter fascination.}
<C>__{mr. hand}
<D>__{mr. spicoli?}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{that's the name they gave me.}
<A>__{mr. hand slowly tears the card into little pieces and sprinkles the pieces over his wastebasket. spicoli watches in disbelief. his hands are frozen in the process of removing his backpack.}
<C>__{spicoli }
<D>__{you just ripped my card in two!}
<C>__{mr. hand}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{hey, bud. what's your problem?}
<A>__{mr. hand moves to within inches of spicoli's face.}
<C>__{mr. hand}
<D>__{no problem at all. i think you know where the front office is.}
<A>__{it takes a moment for the words to work their way out of jeff spicoli's mouth.}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{you... dick.}
<A>__{in the tense moment that follows, no one in the class is sure what might happen. mr. hand simply turns away from jeff spicoli as if he ceased to exist and coolly continues his lecture.}
<C>__{mr. hand}
<D>__{i've taken the time to print up a complete schedule of class quizzes, and the chapters they cover. please pass them back to the desks behind you...}
<A>__{hand begins passing out stacks of purple mimeographed sheets.}
<B>__{angle on students}
<A>__{all smelling the purple mimeographed sheets. still standing in the doorway, hyperventilating with fifteen year old adrenalin, is jeff spicoli. after a time, he fishes a few bits of his ad card out of the wastebasket and huffs out of the room.}
