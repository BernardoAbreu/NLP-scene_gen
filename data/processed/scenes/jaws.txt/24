<L>__{interior county courthouse day}
<A>__{a crowd of angry men and women throng the central hallway, their voices a babble of confusion. many of them are gathered around a roughly lettered notice that has been posted on the town's official bulletin board. it reads. "a $3000 bounty to the man or men who catch and kill the shark that killed alex m. kintner on sunday, june 29, on the amity town beach." vaughn and brody are on the outskirts of the crowd, which includes meadows, some selectmen, and others.}

<D>__{look, i've got to talk to her. this isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.}
<C>__{meadows}
<D>__{i agree. if she's going to advertise, i wouldn't recommend out of town papers. amity people could take care of this.}

<D>__{i'm responsible for public safety around here...}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{then go out tomorrow and make sure no one gets hurt.}
<P>__{(addressing the crowd)}
<D>__{everybody, could i have your attention? since this affects all of us, i suggest we move into council chambers, where there's more room...}
<A>__{there is a flurry and a bustle as everyone rearranges themselves and makes their way into the amity selectmen's council chambers.}
