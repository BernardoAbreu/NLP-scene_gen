<A>__{jody fights for her freedom, tugging at the chimney, kicking and screaming: all of a sudden she feels a surge of pain. she screams and kicks with all her might, freeing herself, her momentum sending her rolling down the roof. she rolls off the roof, barely grabbing hold of the gutter, hanging from it. the gutter starts to break. above her she can hear the killer coming out onto the roof. the killer's silhouette hovers above, ready to grab her. jody knows she has no choice. jody lets go of the gutter.}
