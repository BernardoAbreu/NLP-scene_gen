<A>__{we are at david's parents' house in new york. his father sits reading the paper in the living room as his younger brother and sister watch "the muppet show" on television. we can see past the small dining nook where david sits doing homework and into the kitchen where his mother is washing the dishes. a peaceful lower, middle class setting. all is tranquil and secure. there is a loud pounding on the front door.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{i will get it.}
<A>__{the pounding continues.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{all right, all right! hold your horses.}
<A>__{(the following happens with shocking speed.) when he opens the door, four beings open fire with machine guns, blowing him away. the sudden burst of violence is terrifying and unrelenting. the four rush into the room and the family looks at them in fearsome surprise for these men are not human at all, but loathsome, bestial demons dressed as storm troopers. one kicks in the television and fires into the kitchen, blasting david's mother. david rises but is forced back into his chair by one of the things and held there.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{he watches in horror as his little brother and sister scream in terror before they are brutally murdered. the monstrous storm troopers then set fire to the rooms. the one holding david pulls a knife and quickly slits david's throat.}
