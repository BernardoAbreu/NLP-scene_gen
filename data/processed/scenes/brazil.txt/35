<L>__{interior posh restaurant (entrance) day}
<A>__{the conversation between sam and his mother takes place while they are going through the sort of security checks familiar at airports. they are, however, just outside the velvet rope of the posh restaurant.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(in full flow)}
<D>__{mr helpmann was very close to your poor father. he was very close to me. still is. he'll take you under his wing at information retrieval. you'll like it when you get there.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you're not listening, mother.}
<A>__{a warning buzzer goes off as mother's handbag goes thru security check. it turns out to have been activated by a gaily wrapped package. a security guard relieves her of it and unwraps the package which contains the same kind of executive toy which we have seen twice before.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{it's a present for my son.}
<A>__{she takes the toy back and hands it to sam.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{i hope you like it. it's very exclusive.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{it's something for executives.}
<A>__{at this point the maitre d arrives on the scene.}
<C>__{maitre d}
<D>__{madam lowry, how exquisite to see you again. merry christmas.}
<A>__{he pulls aside he velvet rope with a grand flourish. he looks disdainfully at sam's unfashionable clerk's suite}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{hello, spiro. merry christmas.}
<C>__{spiro}
<P>__{(blocking sam's way)}
<D>__{i'm sorry but ...}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{you remember samuel, my son.}
<C>__{spiro}
<P>__{{suddenly unctious)}
<D>__{oh, but of course ...}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{we're meeting mrs terrain.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{are we?}
<C>__{spiro}
<D>__{ah yes, the lady is waiting.}
<A>__{spiro leads the way. sam and his mother follow, across the restaurant which is much like the palm court at the plaza new york. trellises, marble columns, antique mirroring, potted palms combine to impress us with their sophistication and taste. a string quartet can just be made out against the far wall. except for the unfortunate intrusion of metal tubing and ducting brutally thrusting across areas of the ceiling, occasionally penetrating right through the middle of a particularly valuable looking mirror, the general effect is one of confident wealth and breeding. sam, mother and maitre d make their way across the room. the waltzing strains of the string quartet accompanying them.}
