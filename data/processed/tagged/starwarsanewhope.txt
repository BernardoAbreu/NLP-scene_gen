<C>__{lucasfilm ltd.}
<A>__{a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away... a vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. war drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls into infinity.}
<D>__{it is a period of civil war. rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil galactic empire. during the battle, rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the empire's ultimate weapon, the death star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. pursued by the empire's sinister agents, princess leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy...}
<A>__{the awesome yellow planet of tatooine emerges from a total eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. a tiny silver spacecraft, a rebel blockade runner firing lasers from the back of the ship, races through space. it is pursed by a giant imperial stardestroyer. hundreds of deadly laserbolts streak from the imperial stardestroyer, causing the main solar fin of the rebel craft to disintegrate.}
<L>__{interior rebel blockade runner main passageway}
<A>__{an explosion rocks the ship as two robots, artoo detoo (r2 d2) and see threepio (c 3po) struggle to make their way through the shaking, bouncing passageway. both robots are old and battered. artoo is a short, claw armed tripod. his face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of human proportions. he has a gleaming bronze like metallic surface of an art deco design. another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{did you hear that? they've shut down the main reactor. we'll be destroyed for sure. this is madness!}
<A>__{rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in the main passageway. they aim their weapons toward the door.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{we're doomed!}
<A>__{the little r2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that only another robot could understand.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{there'll be no escape for the princess this time.}
<A>__{artoo continues making beeping sounds. tension mounts as loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{what's that?}
<L>__{exterior spacecraft in space}
<A>__{the imperial craft has easily overtaken the rebel blockade runner. the smaller rebel ship is being drawn into the underside dock of the giant imperial starship.}
<L>__{interior rebel blockade runner}
<A>__{the nervous rebel troopers aim their weapons. suddenly a tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make their way into the smoke filled corridor. in a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with laserfire. the deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns creating huge explosions. stormtroopers scatter and duck behind storage lockers. laserbolts hit several rebel soldiers who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered arms and faces. an explosion hits near the robots.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{i should have known better than to trust the logic of a half sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister...}
<A>__{artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages around the two hapless robots.}
<L>__{exterior tatooine desert wasteland day}
<A>__{a death white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. the tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone figure, luke skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations who looks much younger than his eighteen years. his shaggy hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable lad with a prize winning smile. a light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. he is aided by a beatup tread robot with six claw arms. the little robot appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions. a bright sparkle in the morning sky catches luke's eye and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt. he stands transfixed for a few moments studying the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired landspeeder (an auto like transport that travels a few feet above the ground on a magnetic field). he motions for the tiny robot to follow him.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{hurry up! come with me! what are you waiting for?! get in gear!}
<A>__{the robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and smoke begins to pour out of every jointerior luke throws his arms up in disgust. exasperated, the young farm boy jumps into his landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum madly.}
<L>__{interior rebel blockade runner main hallway}
<A>__{the awesome, seven foot tall dark lord of the sith makes his way into the blinding light of the main passageway. this is darth vader, right hand of the emperor. his face is obscured by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the imperial stormtroopers. everyone instinctively backs away from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through the rebel troops. several of the rebel troops break and run in a frenzied panic.}
<L>__{interior rebel blockade runner}
<A>__{a woman's hand puts a card into an opening in artoo's dome. artoo makes beeping sounds.}
<L>__{interior rebel blockade runner}
<A>__{threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. artoo is nowhere in sight. the pitiful screams of the doomed rebel soldiers can be heard in the distance.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{artoo! artoo detoo, where are you?}
<A>__{a familiar clanking sound attacks threepio's attention and he spots little artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke filled alcove. a beautiful young girl (about sixteen years old) stands in front of artoo. surreal and out of place, dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting something on artoo's computer face, then watches as the little robot joins his companion.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{at last! where have you been?}
<A>__{stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{they're heading in this direction. what are we going to do? we'll be sent to the spice mine of kessel or smashed into who knows what!}
<A>__{artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the subhallway. threepio chases after him.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{wait a minute, where are you going?}
<A>__{artoo responds with electronic beeps.}
<L>__{interior rebel blockade runner corridor}
<A>__{the evil darth vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies of his foes. he grabs a wounded rebel officer by the neck as an imperial officer rushes up to the dark lord.}
<C>__{imperial officer}
<D>__{the death star plans are not in the main computer.}
<A>__{vader squeezes the neck of the rebel officer, who struggles in vain.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{where are those transmissions you intercepted?}
<A>__{vader lifts the rebel off his feet by his throat.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{what have you done with those plans?}
<C>__{rebel officer}
<D>__{we intercepted no transmissions. aaah... this is a consular ship. were on a diplomatic mission.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{if this is a consular ship... were is the ambassador?}
<A>__{the rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the dark lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp. vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to his troops.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the ambassador. i want her alive!}
<A>__{the stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.}
<L>__{interior rebel blockade runner subhallway}
<A>__{the lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the stormtroopers search through the ship. she is princess leia organa, a member of the alderaan senate. the fear in her eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. one of the troopers spots her.}
<C>__{trooper}
<D>__{there she is! set for stun!}
<A>__{leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with her laser pistol. she starts to run but is felled by a paralyzing ray. the troopers inspect her inert body.}
<C>__{trooper}
<D>__{she'll be all right. inform lord vader we have a prisoner.}
<L>__{interior rebel blockade runner subhallway}
<A>__{artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod. he snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light begins to flash. the stubby astro robot works his way into the cramped four man pod.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{hey, you're not permitted in there. it's restricted. you'll be deactivated for sure..}
<A>__{artoo beeps something to him.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! now come out before somebody sees you.}
<A>__{artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding the mission he is about to perform.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{secret mission? what plans? what are you talking about? i'm not getting in there!}
<A>__{artoo isn't happy with threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps and twangs angrily. a new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris through the narrow subhallway. flames lick at threepio and, after a flurry of electronic swearing from artoo, the lanky robot jumps into the lifepod.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{i'm going to regret this.}
<L>__{interior imperial stardestroyer}
<A>__{on the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified robots speeds away from the stricken rebel spacecraft.}
<C>__{chief pilot}
<D>__{there goes another one.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{hold your fire. there are no life forms. it must have been short circuited.}
<L>__{interior lifepod}
<A>__{artoo and threepio look out at the receding imperial starship. stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{that's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here.}
<A>__{artoo beeps an assuring response.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{are you sure this things safe?}
<L>__{exterior tatooine anchorhead settlement power station day}
<A>__{heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white buildings. luke pilots his landspeeder through the dusty empty street of the tiny settlement. an old woman runs to get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist at luke as he flies past.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i've told you kids to slow down!}
<L>__{interior power station day}
<A>__{luke bursts into the power station, waking the fixer, a rugged mechanic and camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been asleep in his lap. they grumbled as he races through the office, yelling wildly.}
<C>__{fixer}
<D>__{did i hear a young noise blast through here?}
<C>__{camie}
<D>__{it was just wormie on another rampage.}
<A>__{luke bounces into a small room behind the office where deak and windy, two tough boys about the same age as luke, are playing a computer pool like game with biggs, a burly, handsome boy a few years older than the rest. his flashy city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose fitting tunics of the farm boys. a robot repairs some equipment in the background.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{shape it up you guys!... biggs?}
<A>__{luke's surprise at the appearance of biggs gives way to great joy and emotion. they give each other a great bear hug.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i didn't know you were back! when did you get in?}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{just now. i wanted to surprise you, hot shot. i thought you'd be here... certainly didn't expect you to be out working.}
<P>__{(he laughs)}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{the academy didn't change you much...but you're back so soon? hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?}
<A>__{biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{of course i got it. signed aboard the rand ecliptic last week. first mate biggs darklighter at your service...}
<P>__{(he salutes)}
<D>__{...i just came to say good bye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.}
<A>__{everyone laughs. the dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend is almost too much for luke, but suddenly he snaps out of it.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i almost forgot. there's a battle going on! right here in our system. come and look!}
<C>__{deak}
<D>__{not again! forget it.}
<L>__{exterior tatooine anchorhead settlement power station }
<B>__{day}
<A>__{the group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. camie and the fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes. luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{there they are!}
<A>__{biggs takes the binoculars from luke as the others strain to see something with the naked eye. through the binoculars biggs sees two small silver specks.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{that's no battle, hot shot... they're just sitting there! probably a freighter tanker refueling.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{but there was a lot of firing earlier...}
<A>__{camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the building in the process. luke grabs them.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{hey, easy with those...}
<C>__{camie}
<D>__{don't worry about it, wormie.}
<A>__{the fixer gives luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs his shoulders in resignation.}
<C>__{fixer}
<D>__{i keep telling you, the rebellion is a long way from here. i doubt if the empire would even fight to keep this system. believe me luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing...}
<A>__{luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. the group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about luke's ineptitude.}
<L>__{interior rebel blockade runner hallway}
<A>__{princess leia is led down a low ceilinged hallway by a squad of armored stormtroopers. her hands are bound and she is brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly marching troops. they stop in a smoky hallway as darth vader emerges from the shadows. the sinister dark lord stares hard at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{lord vader, i should have known. only you could be so bold. the imperial senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{don't play games with me, your highness. you weren't on any mercy mission this time. you passed directly through a restricted system. several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies. i want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about. i'm a member of the imperial senate on a diplomatic mission to alderaan...}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{you're a part of the rebel alliance... and a traitor. take her away!}
<A>__{leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering hole blasted in the side of the ship. an imperial commander turns to vader.}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{holding her is dangerous. if word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the senate.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{i have traced the rebel spies to her. now she is my only link to find their secret base!}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{she'll die before she tells you anything.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{leave that to me. send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!}
<A>__{another imperial officer approaches vader and the commander. they stop and snap to attention.}
<C>__{second officer}
<D>__{lord vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! and no transmissions were made. an escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.}
<A>__{vader turns to the commander.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{she must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. send a detachment down to retrieve them. see to it personally, commander. there'll be no one to stop us this time.}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<L>__{exterior space}
<A>__{the imperial stardestroyer comes over the surface of the planet tatooine.}
<L>__{exterior tatooine desert}
<A>__{jundland, or "no man's land", where the rugged desert mesas meet the foreboding dune sea. the two helpless astro droids kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily work their way across the desert wasteland. the lifepod in the distance rests half buried in the sand.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{how did i get into this mess? i really don't know how. we seem to be made to suffer. it's our lot in life.}
<A>__{artoo answers with beeping sounds.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{i've got to rest before i fall apart. my joints are almost frozen.}
<A>__{artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{what a desolate place this is.}
<A>__{suddenly artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. threepio stops and yells at him.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<A>__{a stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small robot.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{well, i'm not going that way. it's much too rocky. this way is much easier.}
<A>__{artoo counters with a long whistle.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{what makes you think there are settlements over there?}
<A>__{artoo continues to make beeping sounds.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{don't get technical with me.}
<A>__{artoo continues to make beeping sounds.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{what mission? what are you talking about? i've had just about enough of you! go that way! you'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!}
<A>__{threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the direction of the vast dune sea.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{and don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it.}
<A>__{artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. he turns and trudges off in the direction of the towering mesas.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{no more adventures. i'm not going that way.}
<A>__{artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant mountains.}
<L>__{exterior tatooine dune sea}
<A>__{threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a dune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless miles. he looks back in the direction of the now distant rock mesas.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{that malfunctioning little twerp. this is all his fault! he tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.}
<A>__{in a huff of anger and frustration, threepio knocks the sand from his joints. his plight seems hopeless, when a glint of reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving towards him.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{wait, what's that? a transport! i'm saved!}
<A>__{the bronze android waves frantically and yells at the approaching transport.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{over here! help! please, help!}
<L>__{exterior tatooine anchorhead settlement power station day}
<A>__{luke and biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. fixer and the others can be heard working inside.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(very animated)}
<D>__{...so i cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on deak's trail. i was so close i thought i was going to fry my instruments. as it was i busted up the skyhopper pretty bad. uncle owen was pretty upset. he grounded me for the rest of the season. you should have been there... it was fantastic.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{you ought to take it easy luke. you may be the hottest bushpilot this side of mos eisley, but those little skyhoppers are dangerous. keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{look who's talking. now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. you've gotten soft in the city...}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{i've missed you kid.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well, things haven't been the same since you left, biggs. it's been so... quiet.}
<A>__{biggs looks around then leans close to luke.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{luke, i didn't come back just to say good bye... i shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one i can trust... and if i don't come back, i want somebody to know.}
<A>__{luke's eyes are wide with biggs' seriousness and loyalty.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{i made some friends at the academy.}
<P>__{(he whispers)}
<D>__{...when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the alliance...}
<A>__{luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{join the rebellion?! are you kidding! how?}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{quiet down will ya! you got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm quiet.}
<P>__{(he whispers)}
<D>__{listen how quiet i am. you can barely hear me...}
<A>__{biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{my friend has a friend on bestine who might help us make contact.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you're crazy! you could wander around forever trying to find them.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{i know it's a long shot, but if i don't find them i will do what i can on my own... it's what we always talked about. luke, i'm not going to wait for the empire to draft me into service. the rebellion is spreading and i want to be on the right side the side i believe in.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{and i'm stuck here...}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{i thought you were going to the academy next term. you'll get your chance to get off this rock.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{not likely! i had to cancel my application. there has been a lot of unrest among the sandpeople since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of anchorhead.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{your uncle could hold off a whole colony of sandpeople with one blaster.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off. he needs me for just one more season. i can't leave him now.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{i feel for you, luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important. what good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the empire?... you know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems... it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the empire.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it couldn't happen here. you said it yourself. the empire won't bother with this rock.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{things always change.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i wish i was going... are you going to be around long?}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{no, i'm leaving in the morning...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{then i guess i won't see you.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{maybe someday... i will keep a lookout.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well, i will be at the academy next season... after that who knows. i won't be drafted into the imperial starfleet that's for sure... take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend i've got.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{so long, luke.}
<A>__{biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the power station.}
<L>__{exterior tatooine rock canyon sunset}
<A>__{the gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures fill the air. artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he goes. he hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for a moment. convinced he is alone, he continues on his way. in the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. a little further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the narrow path. the unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. he manages one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his back. his bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then off again. out of the rocks scurry three jawas, no taller than artoo. they holster strange and complex weapons as they cautiously approach the robot. they wear grubby cloaks and their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be seen. they hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down the trail.}
<L>__{exterior tatooine rock canyon sandcrawler sunset}
<A>__{the eight jawas carry artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank like vehicle the size of a four story house. they weld a small disk on the side of artoo and then put him under a large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot is sucked into the giant machine. the filthy little jawas scurry like rats up small ladders and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.}
<L>__{interior sandcrawler hold area}
<A>__{it is dim inside the hold area of the sandcrawler. artoo switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles around the scrap heap. the narrow beam swings across rusty metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and maimed astro robots. he lets out a pathetic electronic whimper and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end of the chamber.}
<L>__{interior sandcrawler prison area}
<A>__{artoo enters a wide room with a four foot ceiling. in the middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various shapes and sizes. some are engaged in electronic conversation, while others simply mill about. a voice of recognition calls out from the gloom.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{artoo detoo! it's you! it's you!}
<A>__{a battered threepio scrambles up to artoo and embraces him.}

<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{wake up! wake up!}
<A>__{suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the sandcrawler stops, creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men. threepio's fist bangs the head of artoo whose computer lights pop on as he begins beeping. at the far end of the long chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding white light. a dozen or so jawas make their way through the odd assortment of robots.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{we're doomed.}
<A>__{a jawa starts moving toward them.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{do you think they'll melt us down?}

<A>__{the jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their battered captives, including artoo and threepio, in front of the enormous sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small adobe block house. the jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. the shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils should be. out of the shadows of a dingy side building limps owen lars, a large burly man in his mid fifties. his reddish eyes are sunken in a dust covered face. as the farmer carefully inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump shouldered nephew, luke skywalker. one of the vile little jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales pitch in a queer, unintelligible language. a voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the homestead. luke goes over to the edge and sees his aunt beru standing in the main courtyard.}

<D>__{hello.}

<D>__{with all we've been through, sometimes i'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the rebellion and all.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you know of the rebellion against the empire?}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{that's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.}

<A>__{artoo whistles and beeps a long message to threepio.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{he says he's the property of obi wan kenobi, a resident of these parts. and it's a private message for him. quite frankly, sir i don't know what he's talking about. our last master was captain antilles, but with what we've been through, this little r2 unit has become a bit eccentric.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{obi wan kenobi? i wonder if he means old ben kenobi?}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{i beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?}

<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yes, sir. i think those new droids are going to work out fine. in fact, i, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. and if these new droids do work out, i want to transmit my application to the academy this year.}

<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no, you're not. what kind of talk is that?}
<A>__{luke and ben help the battered robot to his feet. little artoo watches from the top of the pit. ben glances around suspiciously. sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the air.}

<D>__{no, my father didn't fight in the wars. he was a navigator on a spice freighter.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{that's what your uncle told you. he didn't hold with your father's ideals. thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you fought in the clone wars?}

<A>__{ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around. as luke finishes repairing threepio and starts to fit the restraining bolt back on, threepio looks at him nervously. luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the table. ben shuffles up and presents luke with a short handle with several electronic gadgets attached to it.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i have something here for you. your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. he feared you might follow old obi wan on some damned fool idealistic crusade like your father did.}

<A>__{luke pushes a button on the handle. a long beam shoots out about four feet and flickers there. the light plays across the ceiling.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{an elegant weapon for a more civilized time. for over a thousand generations the jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old republic. before the dark times, before the empire.}

<D>__{how did my father die?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{a young jedi named darth vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the empire hunt down and destroy the jedi knights. he betrayed and murdered your father. now the jedi are all but extinct. vader was seduced by the dark side of the force.}

<D>__{general kenobi, years ago you served my father in the clone wars. now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the empire. i regret that i am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and i'm afraid my mission to bring you to alderaan has failed. i have placed information vital to the survival of the rebellion into the memory systems of this r2 unit. my father will know how to retrieve it. you must see this droid safely delivered to him on alderaan. this is our most desperate hour. help me, obi wan kenobi, you're my only hope.}
<A>__{there is a little static and the transmission is cut short. old ben leans back and scratches his head. he silently puffs on a tarnished chrome water pipe. luke has stars in his eyes.}

<C>__{tarkin}
<D>__{the imperial senate will no longer be of any concern to us. i've just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently. the last remnants of the old republic have been swept away.}
<C>__{tagge}
<D>__{that's impossible! how will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?}
<C>__{tarkin}
<D>__{the regional governors now have direct control over territories. fear will keep the local systems in line. fear of this battle station.}
<C>__{tagge}
<D>__{and what of the rebellion? if the rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{the plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.}
<C>__{motti}
<D>__{any attack made by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. this station is now the ultimate power in the universe. i suggest we use it!}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. the ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the force.}
<C>__{motti}
<D>__{don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, lord vader. your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the rebel's hidden fort...}

<C>__{vader}
<D>__{i find your lack of faith disturbing.}
<C>__{tarkin}
<D>__{enough of this! vader, release him!}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{as you wish.}

<C>__{gantry officer}
<D>__{tx four one two. why aren't you at your post? tx four one two, do you copy?}
<A>__{a stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating his comlink is not working. the gantry officer shakes his head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an annoyed look.}
<C>__{gantry officer}
<D>__{take over. we've got a bad transmitter. i will see what i can do.}
<A>__{as the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing the towering chewbacca. the gantry officer, in a momentary state of shock, stumbles backward. with a bone chilling howl, the giant wookiee flattens the officer with one blow. the aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted by han, dressed as an imperial stormtrooper. ben and the robots enter the room quickly followed by luke, also dressed as a stormtrooper. luke quickly removes his helmet.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{bring them on! i prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{we found the computer outlet, sir.}
<A>__{ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of the city appears on the monitor. he begins to inspect it carefully. threepio and artoo look over the control panel. artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{plug in. he should be able to interpret the entire imperial computer network.}
<A>__{artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the vast imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information to the little robot. after a few moments, he beeps something.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{he says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. he'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.}
<A>__{the computer monitor flashes readouts.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{the tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. a power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.}
<A>__{ben studies the data on the monitor readout.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i don't think you boys can help. i must go alone.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{whatever you say. i've done more that i bargained for on this trip already.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i want to go with you.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{be patient, luke. stay and watch over the droids.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{but he can...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{they must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as alderaan. your destiny lies along a different path than mine. the force will be with you... always!}
<A>__{ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps out of the command office, then disappears down a long grey hallway. chewbacca barks a comment and han shakes his head in agreement.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{boy you said it, chewie.}
<A>__{han looks at luke.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{where did you dig up that old fossil?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{ben is a great man.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{yeah, great at getting us into trouble.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i didn't hear you give any ideas...}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{who do you think...}
<A>__{suddenly artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak. luke goes over to him.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{i'm afraid i'm not quite sure, sir. he says "i found her", and keeps repeating, "she's here."}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well, who... who has he found?}
<A>__{artoo whistles a frantic reply.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{princess leia.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{the princess? she's here?}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{princess? what's going on?}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{level five. detention block a a twenty three. i'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh, no! we've got to do something.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{the droid belongs to her. she's the one in the message... we've got to help her.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{now, look, don't get any funny ideas. the old man wants us to wait right here.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{but he didn't know she was here. look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{i'm not going anywhere.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{they're going to execute her. look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. now all you want to do is stay.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{marching into the detention area is not what i had in mind.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{but they're going to kill her!}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{better her than me...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{she's rich.}
<A>__{chewbacca growls.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{rich?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yes. rich, powerful! listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well more wealth that you can imagine.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{i don't know, i can imagine quite a bit!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you'll get it!}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{i better!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you will...}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{all right, kid. but you'd better be right about this.}
<A>__{han looks at chewie, who grunts a short grunt.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{all right.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{what's your plan?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{uh... threepio, hand me those binders there will you?}
<A>__{luke moves toward chewbacca with electronic cuffs.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{okay. now, i'm going to put these on you.}
<A>__{chewie lets out a hideous growl.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{okay. han, you put these on.}
<A>__{luke sheepishly hands the binders to han.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{don't worry, chewie. i think i know what he has in mind.}
<A>__{the wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as han binds him with the electronic cuffs.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{master luke, sir! pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should artoo and i do if we're discovered here?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{lock the door!}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{and hope they don't have blasters.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{that isn't very reassuring.}
<A>__{luke and han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and start off into the giant imperial death star.}
<L>__{interior death star detention area elevator tube}
<A>__{han and luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. troops, bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio completely. only a few give the giant wookiee a curious glance. finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i can't see a thing in this helmet.}
<A>__{a bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away by han. the door to the pod like vehicle slides closed and the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.}
<L>__{interior death star main hallway}
<A>__{several imperial officers walk through the wide main passageway. they pass several stormtroopers and a robot similar to threepio but with an insect face. at the far end of the hallway, a passing flash of ben kenobi appears, then disappears down a small hallway. his appearance is so fleeting that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion. no one in the hallway seems to notice him.}
<L>__{interior death star interior elevator detention security}
<B>__{area}
<A>__{luke and han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door slides open behind them. the giant wookiee and his two guards enter the old grey security station. guards and laser gates are everywhere. han whispers to luke under his breath.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{this is not going to work.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{why didn't you say so before?}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{i did say so before!}
<L>__{interior detention area}
<A>__{elevator doors open. a tall, grim looking officer approaches the trio.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{where are you taking this... thing?}
<A>__{chewie growls a bit at the remark but han nudges him to shut up.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{prisoner transfer from block one one three eight.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{i wasn't notified. i will have to clear it.}
<A>__{the officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in the information. there are only three other troopers in the area. luke and han survey the situation, checking all of the alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. han unfastens one of chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to luke. suddenly chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one of his ear piercing howls. he grabs han's laser rifle.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{look out! he's loose!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{he's going to pull us all apart.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{go get him!}
<A>__{the startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. luke and han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are blasting away at the terrifying wookiee. their barrage of laserfire misses chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser gate controls, and the imperial guards. the officer is the last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is about to push the alarm system. han rushes to the comlink system, which is screeching questions about what is going on. he quickly checks the computer readout.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{we've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. here it is... cell twenty one eight seven. you go get her. i will hold them here.}
<A>__{luke races down one of the cell corridors. han speaks into the buzzing comlink.}
<C>__{han}
<P>__{(sounding official)}
<D>__{everything is under control. situation normal.}
<C>__{intercom voice}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{han}
<P>__{(getting nervous)}
<D>__{uh... had a slight weapons malfunction. but, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. we're fine. we're all fine here, now, thank you. how are you?}
<C>__{intercom voice}
<D>__{we're sending a squad up.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{uh, uh, negative. we had a reactor leak here now. give us a few minutes to lock it down. large leak... very dangerous.}
<C>__{intercom voice}
<D>__{who is this? what's your operating number?}
<A>__{han blasts the comlink and it explodes.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{boring conversation anyway.}
<P>__{(yelling down the hall)}
<D>__{luke! we're going to have company!}
<L>__{interior death star cell row}
<A>__{luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door away with a laser pistol. when the smoke clears, luke sees the dazzling young princess senator. she had been sleeping and is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on her face. luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands staring at her with his mouth hanging open.}
<C>__{leia}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper?}
<A>__{luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what? oh... the uniform. i'm luke skywalker. i'm here to rescue you.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{you're who?}

<D>__{he is here...}
<C>__{tarkin}
<D>__{obi wan kenobi! what makes you think so?}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{a tremor in the force. the last time i felt it was in the presence of my old master.}
<C>__{tarkin}
<D>__{surely he must be dead by now.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{don't underestimate the power of the force.}
<C>__{tarkin}
<D>__{the jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. you, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.}
<A>__{there is a quiet buzz on the comlink.}
<C>__{tarkin}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{intercom voice}
<D>__{governor tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block a a twenty three.}
<C>__{tarkin}
<D>__{the princess! put all sections on alert!}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{obi wan is here. the force is with him.}

<D>__{chewie!}
<A>__{chewbacca responds with a growling noise.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{get behind me! get behind me!}
<A>__{a series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door through which several imperial troops begin to emerge. han and chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke and flame. they turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting up with luke and leia rushing toward them.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{can't get out that way.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.}
<C>__{han}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<D>__{maybe you'd like it back in your cell, your highness.}
<A>__{luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as they continue to exchange fire with stormtroopers making their way down the corridor.}

<P>__{(over comlink)}
<D>__{yes sir?}

<L>__{interior death star main bay gantry control tower}

<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{i said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. the main entrance seems to be the only way in or out; all other information on your level is restricted.}

<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{oh, no!}
<L>__{interior death star detention corridor}
<A>__{luke and leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as they continue to exchange fire with troops. han and chewbacca are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far and of the hallway. the laserfire is very intense, and smoke fills the narrow cell corridor.}

<D>__{there isn't any other way out.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{i can't hold them off forever! now what?}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{this is some rescue. when you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?}

<D>__{he's the brains, sweetheart.}
<A>__{luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well, i didn't...}
<A>__{the princess grabs luke's gun and fires at a small grate in the wall next to han, almost frying him.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing?}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{somebody has to save our skins. into the garbage chute, wise guy.}
<A>__{she jumps through the narrow opening as han and chewbacca look on in amazement. chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and says something.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{get in there you big furry oaf! i don't care what you smell! get in there and don't worry about it.}
<A>__{han gives him a kick and the wookiee disappears into the tiny opening. luke and han continue firing as they work their way toward the opening.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{wonderful girl! either i'm going to kill her or i'm beginning to like her. get in there!}
<A>__{luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. han fires off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover, then slides into the chute himself and is gone.}
<L>__{interior death star garbage room}
<A>__{han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck. luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. he finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. it won't budge.}
<C>__{han}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<D>__{oh! the garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. what an incredible smell you've discovered! let's get out of here! get away from there...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no! wait!}
<A>__{han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. the laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room. everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes almost on top of them. leia climbs out of the garbage with a rather grim look on her face.}

<D>__{will you forget it? i already tried it. it's magnetically sealed!}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{put that thing away! you're going to get us all killed.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{absolutely, your worship. look, i had everything under control until you led us down here. you know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{it could be worse...}
<A>__{a loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the murky depths. chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins to back away. han and luke stand fast with their laser pistols drawn. the wookiee is cowering near one of the walls.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{it's worse.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{there's something alive in here!}
