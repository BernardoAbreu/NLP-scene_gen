<L>__{interior town hall night}
<A>__{on stage, lariviere arranges the contest winners. a fairy godmother with a wand beams while, nearby, a hobo writhes in his mother's grip a hard loser. wade looks for jill, first among the winners, then among the losers; she's nowhere to be found. he heads toward a hall leading to the restrooms. jill stands alone in the corner next to the pay phone, tiny, forlorn. wade realizes at once he was wrong to leave her before she had found a friend.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{some party, huh? sorry i lost sight of you. i had to step outside for a smoke. you find anybody you know here? there must be some kids you used to know from school. you want to go tomorrow? see your old teachers? be more fun than hanging out with me all day.}
