<L>__{exterior desert later}
<A>__{the camera pans over the vast expanse of nothingness. smoke}
<B>__{begins to drift into frame. the camera finally lands on the}
<A>__{shi'ite encampment, or at least what's left of it. tents are torn down and burned, goods scattered. it looks like a ghost town. epps, wes and jaeger wander into it. they look around, but see no signs of life. wes grabs up some shi'ite garments, white robes, and starts to put them on.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{you're going to burn up in those.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{the white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler. that's why they wear them.}
<A>__{jaeger looks to epps who just shrugs. jaeger gets some robes and puts them on. epps follows suit.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{think the iraqi's killed them all?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{probably shot a few. scattered the rest. murderers.}
<C>__{epps}
<P>__{(pointed)}
<D>__{murder, or a combat action? it's hard to tell them apart?}
<A>__{they keep on moving, passing straight through the camp. epps marches ahead, not wanting to even deal with the other two men. wes talks after him. really he talks more to himself, and he's not sounding too lucid.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you saw how he ran didn't you? first chance he got he ran out. would have gone straight to his co, told him all about the gold. what do you think would have happened then, huh? then what do you think would have happened? two thousand screaming iraqis bearing down on us. you ought to thank me for killing him. i will get a medal for it. watch and see if i don't get a medal.}
<A>__{epps isn't even paying attention, he's just walking on. almost, as if he senses something is wrong, he stops in his tracks. he looks down at his feet and sees the most curious thing. sand is rushing away from his feet, almost as if it's going down a drain. he looks at it with the same wonderment that a dog watches television.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what the hell...?}
<A>__{epps has got all of about two seconds to ponder this as a moment later the earth literally drops from beneath his feet. he's standing on a sink hole that opens up swallowing him in loose sand. immediately he sinks to waist level. he slows there, but still goes down with rapidity. he screams to jaeger and wes.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{help! help me!}
<A>__{jaeger drops the gold and runs to the edge of the hole. wes doesn't move.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{help me!}
<A>__{jaeger is paralyzed by indecision. he doesn't want to let epps drown, but if he gets too close he could easily get sucked into. he flirts back and forth between rescue and safety. sand continues to pour in on epps.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{for christ's sake, jaeger! help me! help me!}
<A>__{jaeger can't fight himself any longer. he lowers himself halfway into the hole, stretching spread eagle trying to keep some kind of grip on the firmer ground, and reaches for epps. their arms twist and strain for each others. first their fingers meet, then they grab hands. they work a grip down to their wrist, but that's all they can get. jaeger strains like a field horse pulling epps against the sand. it may not be enough as he begins to slip down himself. jaeger twists his head and looks up at wes. straining to say anything he pleads:}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{wes...wes!}
<A>__{his words fall on deaf ears. wes just takes a step closer to the pack of gold coins. this only serves to energize jaeger. he digs deeper within himself finding an untapped reserve of strength. he grunts and pulls, the veins on his neck puffing like balloons. epps finds same purchase. he pulls, swims, his way up from the sand. a little at first, but like hitting shallow water he's able to lift himself up. jager jerks him the rest of the way up to firm ground. they collapse, chests heaving like pistons as they suck air. as epps regains strength he pats himself down. suddenly he goes back into a panic.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{the navicom!}
<A>__{epps rolls back over and thrusts his hands down into the soft sand frantically looking for the lost computer. jaeger joins in. they dig and scrape as best they can, but daring to venture only so far into the soft sand. it doesn't matter. the navicom is lost.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{what are we going to do? how are we going to find our way back!?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we'll find our way.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{how!?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we'll find our way! we'll...}
<A>__{epps wants to say how, but he's got no idea. wes grows a smug smile.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{no navicom. a lot of good you are now, epps.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{lot of good you were when i was sinking in the sand.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{and let me guess who is.}
<A>__{wes casually slides out his m 16.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{i'm the one's got the big stick.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{suppose i don't go for that?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{then i suppose it'd be insurrection, and i suppose i'd have to kill you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i suppose.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what about jaeger?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{nothing about him, unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{yeah, i got a problem with you killing epps.}
<A>__{wes turns and glares at jaeger, who backs down.}
<D>__{jaeger(cont} i mean, in principle.}
<C>__{wes}
<P>__{{sneering)}
<D>__{you know, jaeger, you really are a bitch.}
<A>__{epps isn't wasting anymore time. when wes turns to glower at jaeger he lunges up for him. wes side steps epps and lands the but of his rifle into the side of epps' head. it opens a wound, and sends epps back down to the ground. epps looks up right into the muzzle of west m 16. full of poison:}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you die!}
<A>__{wes is just about to squeeze back the trigger when a shot rings out. wes' body jerks like he's just been hit in the back with a truck. the way cut timber falls he slams to the ground motionless. epps and jaeger stare at the body for a beat, then snap their heads in the direction of the shot. up on a dune behind them are a group of shi'ites on horseback. one of them has a high powered rifle which he has just used to drill wes. he fires another shot. it pings to the ground between epps and jaeger. our two remaining men scramble. jaeger dives for the gold and snatches it up from the ground as bullets zip around it. the two take off running as best they can in the sand. they run wildly, erratically, without looking back. they run until their bodies scream no more, then keep going on inertia. reaching a dune they tumble down the far side and collapse in a heap at the bottom. they take a moment to catch what breath they can, then:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we got to go back. we got to go back for wes.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{forget wes.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we can't just leave him.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{wes is dead!}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what if he's not?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{then he will be when those iraqis get to him. he was going to kill you. he was one blink away from it. he's dead, epps, and i'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.}
<A>__{they sit there trying to catch their breath. as they do a sound comes from the distance. they freeze, ears cocked, trying to figure out what it is.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{it's a helicopter.}
<A>__{quickly, desperately, as the sound of the chopter draws closer, they scan the horizon looking for it. jaeger spots it and thrusts a finger in its direction.}
<C>__{jager}
<D>__{there.}
<A>__{epps scrambles out his binoculars. he targets the helicopter. jaeger waits in high anticipation.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{ours, or theirs?}
<A>__{epps can't make out for sure. jaeger asks again with growing anxiety.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{ours, or theirs?}
<A>__{epps takes a long, hard stare.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{ours. it's one of ours. we've got to signal them; let them know we're down here.}
<A>__{the instant jaeger hears this his face twists up like he's thinking something, and he doesn't like what it is he's thinking. quietly, almost to himself:}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we need something: a flare, a signal mirror.}
<A>__{again jaeger says it, this time including epps too.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what do you mean no? they can fly us home.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{they'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we'll lie.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{they'll search the pack.}
<A>__{epps finds a mirror in one of his pockets. he stands, ready to signal the chopter.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{they'll find the gold.}
<A>__{epps turns sharply back to jaeger.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we're lost, you understand that? we've got no navicom, and no means to find a way back. so right now i don't give a damn about the gold because if we don't get off this desert, and out of iraqi all it's going to be good for is buying us tombstones.}
<A>__{epps is back around ready to signal the helicopter. he's about to raise the mirror when he hears the sound of an m 16 action being worked. epps turns to face jaeger.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i can't do it, epps. not when we're so close. i can't let you ruin everything.}
<A>__{epps just stares at jaeger, not frightened, but surprisingly calm.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{first wes, now you?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i'm not like wes. wes was crazy.}
<C>__{epps}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{and you; you've got it all together.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i don't want it this way. i wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but i can't let you lose the gold for me. not when we're so close.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{that helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death.}
<A>__{jaeger is unfazed. very politely he says:}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{sit down, epps.}
<A>__{epps takes him up on the offer. what choice does he have? the camera stays tight on the two men. they don't talk. they don't move. they just sit as we hear the sound of the}
<B>__{helicopter getting closer and louder. it reaches a}
<A>__{crescenoo, then begins to fade until it disappears: . the chopter is gone, along with epps and jaeger's best chance of getting out of the desert alive. jaeger lowers his rifle. very genuinely he says:}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i'm sorry about that, epps.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{is it all right if i stand up?}
<A>__{like he didn't know he was keeping epps from something.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{oh, yeah. go ahead.}
<A>__{epps stands. he looks around trying to figure things out. not much to figure. there still in the middle of a desert in a hostile country same as they ever were.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i'm glad i didn't have to kill you. i'm glad it didn't come to that.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{yeah. well, me too.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i never killed anybody before. i talk a good game, but i'm not like that.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{really, i'm not. remember how i was talking i wanted to blow away all those iraqis? that's all it was was talk. i was scared out of my mind to go to war. i still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you still got a map on you?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{what? yeah.}
<A>__{jaeger takes out the maps he has and hands them to epps. epps looks them over, then looks over the terrain. without any landmarks or navigating tools the maps might as well be finger paintings.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{epps?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i don't want to die.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{makes two of us.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i know what i did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much i want that gold.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it's all right. i don't like it, but it's over now.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i never had anything before, epps. i never was anybody. not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins. when i was in high school i used to }
<A>__{fed up with jaeger epps turns on him hard.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{hey, you know what? can i be honest with you? right now i'm not all that interested in how you're messed up 'cause you didn't get the bicycle you wanted for your thirteenth birthday. what i'm interested in is how i can keep from getting dead. and listening to sob stories from some about how the system wasn't good to him because he had to work like everybody else instead of being born a kennedy doesn't do a damn thing to help keep me alive. so do me a favor; either shut up, or...just shut up.}
<A>__{jaeger isn't sure what to say.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{damn.}
<A>__{epps sits down in the sand, all out of ideas. there's a long quiet before jaeger says:}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{what do you think our chances are?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{if we can find the hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. we've got enough water for that. but we won't make another day otherwise.}
<A>__{again they sit for a beat.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{wonder how the war's going?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it's got to be going better than this..}
<A>__{epps stands and has a last look around.}
<P>__{epps{cont)}
<D>__{all right. pick a direction.}
<A>__{jaeger just gives a surprised look.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we can't just sit here. we've got to start moving, so pick.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{you sure you want me too?}
<A>__{epps nods. jaeger stands and takes a good look around. he considers things, although there isn't much to consider. finally he decisively points in a direction.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i pick that way.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{okay. then we go this way.}
<A>__{epps heads off in the opposite direction.}
