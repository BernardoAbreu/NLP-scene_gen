<L>__{interior wally's car drive in theatre early evening}
<A>__{wally's car comes bouncing along the ditches of the closed drive in. homer is at the wheel; candy calls out some driving instructions. the car comes to a stop next to a speakerpost. candy leans out; she grabs the speaker and hangs it on the window. homer sits back and drapes his arms out the window and over the seat. he feels great.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{you're a natural. you were born to drive a car like this.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{you think? maybe i was.}
<P>__{(looks around)}
<D>__{i love this place!}
<A>__{homer looks up at the giant movie screen.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{the screen is enormous! imagine king kong up there! have you seen a lot of movies here?}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{yes... and no. when you come here, you don't really care about the movie.}
<A>__{homer stares at candy in disbelief.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{you don't care about the movie?}
<A>__{candy looks at him for a moment.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{what are you so crazy about the movies for?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{it was my favorite night at the orphanage movie night. we'd race into the dining hall. of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{at least you were never lonely.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{i didn't say that. growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. you're just never alone.}
<A>__{candy is moved. homer feels exposed; he tries to change the mood by making light of what he's said.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{you're not alone in the bathroom, or... or in the shower... you're never alone in wanting the last piece of meatloaaf, or even in your own bed on a cold morning.}
<A>__{candy laughs.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{you don't miss it?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{i miss things. i miss... people.}
<P>__{(with certainty)}
<D>__{i miss reading to the boys.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{but you had so much responsibility.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{i never asked for any responsibility.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{just a little privacy.}
<A>__{homer laughs.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{privacy is exactly the point of drive in movies.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{did you come here with wally to not watch movies?}
<A>__{at the mention of wally they both look a little self conscious.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{sometimes... movies mostly bore wally.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{ah ha.}
<P>__{(points to the speaker)}
<D>__{so what is that a radio?}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{the speaker. for the movie sound.}
<A>__{candy looks at homer.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{scrunch down like this.}
<A>__{candy scrunches down in her seat; homer imitates her. homer is focused on the giant screen.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{how could you not care about the movie?}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{you just cuddle. you come to hug... to kiss. you don't come here to watch the movie.}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(teasing her)}
<D>__{that's what i'd come here for. i'd watch the movie.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{not with the right girl you wouldn't.}
<A>__{homer's expression changes from exhilarated to guilty. he leans back in his seat and looks straight ahead at the screen. candy tentatively leans her head on his shoulder. homer looks afraid to breathe. from behind, with her head on his shoulder, they look like a normal couple. we track in toward the huge screen until we see only the screen. there are shadows on the black screen. suddenly the movie "king kong" appears.}
