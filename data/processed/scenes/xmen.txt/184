<L>__{interior elevator shaft night}
<A>__{storm's eyes open, looking straight up. angle on: the elevator continuing its crushing descent. storm struggles to her feet. her hand presses against the thick glass elevator shaft, it surrounds her like a coffin. lightning strike the glass to no effect. storm frantically searches for a way out. she looks up to see the elevator closing fast. storm raises her hands above her head. wind begins to lift storm's hair. the wind picks up and starts swirling violently against the sides of the elevator shaft. wildly, the wind whips around causing a cyclone within the glass shaft buffeting upwards against the elevator. the elevator groans as the hydraulics fight the unrelenting vortex of wind. smoke begins to pour from the hydraulics, which whine in protest. at the center of the tornado stands storm, a force of nature. as the elevator continues its descent the cyclone pushes outward. small cracks start to appear on the glass walls. she is now forced almost to the ground. the elevator is now inches from storm's head. the floor is made of a thicker version of the same plexiglas and we look up through it, the massive elevator looming over storm.}

<A>__{the glass walls explode outward, showering the museum. storm partly rolls and is partly blown from the shaft to safety. the pressure of the cyclone released, the elevator slams to the bottom.}
