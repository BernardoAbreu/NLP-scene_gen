<L>__{exterior unopened freeway. night.}
<A>__{an abandoned freeway project in queens. the four hundred yard stretch of deserted freeway is paved but unmarked. at one end is an off ramp that abruptly ends in inid air, reinforcing steel protuding from the concrete. truman stands at the end of the off ramp with marlon, thirty two, the kind of physique some descibe as fat, others big. marlon drinks beer from a can while truman addresses a teed up golf ball with a number three wood. truman winds up and swings, making a healthy contact with the ball. the ball arches away into the night sky, lit by the adjacent operating roadway. from a new angle we see the ball take a huge hop on the outside lane of the abandoned freeway and continue down the asphalt. marlon tosses truman another ball from a bucket of badly scarred golf balls a ball initialed with the letter, "t". truman sets the ball up on the makeshift tee area and launches himself into his second shot. with a slight fade, the second ball carries even further than the first. truman hands marlon their sole golf club without comment. marlon is still looking admiringly in the direction of the shot.}
<C>__{marlon}
<D>__{ouch. whose nuts were those?}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(opening a beer from the six pack)}
<D>__{mine.}
<A>__{marlon tees up a ball of his own. initialed with the letter "m".}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{i gotta get out, marlon.}
<C>__{marlon}
<P>__{(mild interest only)}
<D>__{yeah? outta what?}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{outta my job, outta queens... out!}
<A>__{marlon takes a practise swing.}
<C>__{marlon}
<D>__{outta your job?}
<A>__{what the hell's wrong}
<D>__{with your job?}
<A>__{you gotta great job.}
<D>__{you gotta desk job. i'd kill for a desk job.}
<A>__{marlon addresses the ball and swings. a sweeping hook shot that bounces off the freeway out of bounds.}
<C>__{marlon}
<P>__{(annoyed by the errant tee shot)}
<D>__{sonofabitch.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{it doesn't mean anything.}
<C>__{marlon}
<P>__{(still looking in the direction of his ball)}
<D>__{nothing means anything. try stocking vending machines for a living. my biggest decision of the day is whether the almond joys look better next to the snickers or the baby ruths.}
<A>__{truman selects another "m" ball from the bucket and tosses it to marlon.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(adamant)}
<D>__{i gotta get out.}
<A>__{overcompensating with his second shot, marlon slices the ball in the other direction. a lucky bounce keeps it on the cement fairway.}
<C>__{marlon}
<P>__{(skeptical, picking up his beer)}
<D>__{sure and go where?}
<A>__{truman gulps his beer as he prepares his answer.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(unable to disguise his reverence)}
<D>__{australia.}
<C>__{marlon}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{no shit. where is australia exactly? near england?}
<A>__{truman picks up a golf ball to demonstrate. he points to a dimple on his make shift globe.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{see here, this is queens.}
<P>__{(sliding his finger around the other side of the ball)}
<D>__{all the way round here, australia. you can't get any further away before you start coming back.}
<P>__{(tossing the world in his hand, warming to his subject)}
<D>__{y'know, there're still places in australia where no human being has ever set foot.}
<C>__{marlon}
<P>__{(still dubious)}
<D>__{so when are you leaving?}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{it's not that simple. takes money, planning. you can't just up and go.}
<P>__{(heading off marlon's skepticism)}
<D>__{oh, i'm gonna do it, don't worry about that. i just gotta move slow. pick a moment. bonus time's just around the corner. soon as i get a retaining wall built on the back of the house i can start thinking about selling up...and i will be gone. up and away on that big steel bird.}
<P>__{(as if to convince himself)}
<D>__{i'm going, don't you worry about that.}
<A>__{marlon nods even though the concept of taking flight is beyond his imagination.}
<C>__{marlon}
<D>__{i never knew anybody who got out.}
<A>__{an awkward moment. truman, once again, not so sure of himself. he masks his doubt by teeing up another ball.}
