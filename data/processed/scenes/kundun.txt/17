<L>__{interior parent's room day}
<A>__{close on the faces of the six men. close on the small face of lhamo as he looks down at the bed. lying on a piece of yellow silk are many objects. there are three of each type of object: three walking sticks, three drums, three silver pens, three eating bowls, three bells, three rosaries, three pairs of spectacles. the lama of sera keustang rinpoche hands lhamo the rosary he had so coveted when the man first visited.}
<C>__{keustang rinpoche}
<D>__{this is yours, you say. what else belongs to you?}
<A>__{lhamo considers the request, then climbs onto the bed to study the objects. the drum and the bell he chooses quickly. keustang rinpoche watches the boy gather the items. he looks at the yellow silk and the boy's small, fine hands. he dares not look directly at the boy. lhamo picks up one walking stick a lovely, bronze handled one. he swings it around, but he finally rejects it in favor of a plain, iron handled stick. he makes his own pile of these things, then looks at the lama of sera.}
<C>__{keustang rinpoche}
<D>__{yes, those are yours.}
<A>__{keustang rinpoche takes the boy's hands in his own. he turns them over, examines them.}
<C>__{keustang rinpoche}
<D>__{with permission?}
<A>__{the lama carefully pulls back the boy's overalls. there is a little birthmark, like a conch shell, on his shoulder. keustang rinpoche pulls up the boy's pants legs. there is a funny skin marking on the legs, like tiger stripes. the lama rearranges the boy's clothing, then one more time, takes the beautiful, little hands in his own and whispers:}
<C>__{keustang rinpoche}
<D>__{"kundun"}
<A>__{he says to the others, in a soft, secretive voice:}
<C>__{keustang rinpoche}
<D>__{he is the presence.}
<A>__{in the background, by an open curtain, we see lhamo's mother. she says, softly:}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{my oldest boy is an incarnation.}
<C>__{keustang rinpoche}
<D>__{so is your youngest.}
<A>__{keustang releases the boy's hands and brings his own closed palms up to his forehead.}
<C>__{keustang rinpoche}
<D>__{i wish you long life.}
<A>__{the mother begins to cry.}
