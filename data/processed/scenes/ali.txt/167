<A>__{grabbing. holding. ali's got joe's powerful left tied up this time. a clinch. separating. a punch. a hook. clinching. they separate...}
<T>__{over joe:}
<A>__{ali, having joe at the right range, hits him. joe moves in. ali drags him closer and ties him up. they dance...}
<B>__{their bodies}
<A>__{ali does a little shuffle, circles to keep joe at hitting distance, lands a combination. joe closes, but ali won't let him in and ties up joe. we hear a bell and that's the end of the fight. not a bang; a whimper.}
<B>__{referee}
<A>__{holds up ali's hand and mouths silently words we cannot hear. and as we move closer into ali's eyes, we see no exaltation. this is a victory, but a hollow one. it's a decision eked out.}
