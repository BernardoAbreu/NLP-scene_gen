<L>__{interior viktor's malibu home morning}
<A>__{viktor and lainey make breakfast. lainey is in her pajamas, occasionally glancing to a laptop computer as her father prepares french toast.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(glancing to the computer)}
<D>__{can't you stop that?}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{those things can be dangerous. staring at a screen all day you miss what's going on outside in the real world. you can lose yourself. you should get out more. how are you going to meet boys?}
<C>__{lainey}
<P>__{(shrugs coyly, getting up)}
<D>__{i know plenty of boys.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{really? who? where do you meet them? in a chat room? how do you know he's not some middle aged freak?}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{dad, i can spot a middle aged freak a mile away.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{okay. but you have to find a way to escape that thing.}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{i read.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{you do? still? i can't tell you how happy i am to hear that.}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{you were the one who insisted on it. reading me dostoyevsky and joyce when i was four.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{you understood them. that's what was amazing.}
<P>__{(looking out the window)}
<D>__{it's a nice day. let's eat outside.}
<A>__{lainey grabs the plates and opens the deck door. we hear a chorus of clicks.}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{actually, it may be nicer inside.}
<A>__{viktor joins her at the doorway.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{stay here, i will deal with this.}
<A>__{unfazed, lainey retreats into the house.}
