<C>__{reineman}
<D>__{look, mr. potter, it's no skin off my nose. i'm just your little rent collector. but you can't laugh off this bailey park any more. look at it.}
<A>__{a buzzer is heard, and potter snaps on the dictaphone on his desk.}
<C>__{secretary's voice}
<D>__{congressman blatz is here to see you.}
<C>__{potter}
<P>__{(to dictaphone)}
<D>__{oh, tell the congressman to wait.}
<P>__{(to reineman)}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{reineman}
<D>__{fifteen years ago, a half dozen houses stuck here and there.}
<P>__{(indicating map)}
<D>__{there's the old cemetery, squirrels, buttercups, daisies. used to hunt rabbits there myself. look at it today. dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw. ninety per cent owned by suckers who used to pay rent to you. your potter's field, my dear mr. employer, is becoming just that. and are the local yokels making with those david and goliath wisecracks!}
<C>__{potter}
<D>__{oh, they are, are they? even though they know the baileys haven't made a dime out of it.}
<C>__{reineman}
<D>__{you know very well why. the baileys were all chumps. every one of these homes is worth twice what it cost the building and loan to build. if i were you, mr. potter...}
<C>__{potter}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
