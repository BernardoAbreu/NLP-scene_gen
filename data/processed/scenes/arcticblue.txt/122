<A>__{eric limps further down from the mountains. corbett keeps pace in front of him and his magnum. as their altitude decreases, there is ever thicker vegetation. their tracks in the snow stretch up behind them into the distance. the magnificence and grandeur of the surroundings cannot be overstated. picture the most rustic, overwhelming wilderness imaginable, and then make it ten times larger. new angle later the men's way is once again interrupted, this time by a sheer granite drop. the steep decline would be tough to negotiate with mountaineering equipment and proper footwear. corbett peers over the edge and shakes his head.}

<A>__{eric realizes he's right. after some deliberation, eric cautiously approaches him. with the .357 cocked and ready, he undoes one of the cuffs, leaving them hanging from corbett's wrist. he then unthreads the nylon twine from corbett's tarp. angle granite sheer eric and corbett are tied, belt to belt, with the nylon rope. corbett inches down first, feet spread for maximum footing, gloveless hands grasping at anything. eric mimics corbett's moves and follows the same path. unable to grasp the rocks effectively, he stops and takes his gloves off. continuing, he winces the rock is cold and sharp. his hands are soon numb and bloody. even in the dry, below freezing air, eric is sweating. he looks down and hangs on more tightly. sliding to level ground two hundred feet below would pummel him to hamburger. corbett pauses and rests his cheek against the rocks. eric is right above him. suddenly, corbett's foot slips. his right hand instinctively goes for a hold. the dangling handcuffs snare on a protuberance, knocking him off balance. the fulcrum of corbett's body leans out into the empty air. eric moves down a little, braces himself and extends his leg, giving corbett something to grab. corbett takes hold of eric's shoe and tries to teeter back against the rock wall. adrenaline screams through eric's system. corbett looks up at eric. a careless move will send them both tumbling. eric clutches harder at the rocks and waits for the worst. after a long moment, corbett regains his balance and lets go of eric's foot. he continues his descent. eric lets out his breath and tries to swallow. his mouth is as dry as the granite.}
