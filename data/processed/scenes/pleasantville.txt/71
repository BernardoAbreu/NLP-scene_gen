<L>__{interior storeroom.}
<A>__{it is just as cheery as the rest of the place. there is a small table with a telephone on it. a texaco calendar shows a happy family motoring in their rambler.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<A>__{mr. johnson glances down with a little shame and confusion.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{well ... i'm not sure i see the point anymore.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what are you talking about! you make hamburgers! that is the point!}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{no i know ... i know i do ...}
<P>__{(he pauses, then looks up)}
<D>__{but it's always the same, you know? grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... it never changes. it never gets any better or worse ...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{just listen to me ...}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<P>__{(not hearing him)}
<D>__{... like the other night, when i closed up by myself. that was different ...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{forget about that!}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{oh ... okay.}
<P>__{(beat lower)}
<D>__{... but i really liked it.}
<A>__{bud takes a deep breath. he stares at mr. johnson, then tries to speak softly.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{look, you can't always like what you do. sometimes you just do it because it's your job. and even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{so they can have their hamburgers!}
<A>__{this sounds stupid even to david. he shakes his head.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<P>__{(like a secret)}
<D>__{you know what i really like?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(warily)}
<D>__{... what's that?}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{christmastime.}
<A>__{david rolls his eyes. mr. johnson leans closer, speaking furtively.}
<C>__{mr. johnson }
<D>__{see every year on dec 3, i get to paint the christmas decorations in the window. and every year, i get to paint a different thing ...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{one year it's the north pole. the next i do santa's workshop. here i will show you.}
<A>__{he pulls a photo album from the back of the desk and opens it for david.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{wow ... that's pretty good ...}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{thanks.}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{but this morning i was thinking about it and i realized that i looked forward to it all year. and then i thought "gee. that seems awfully silly. that seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"}
<A>__{david looks at him speechless.}
<C>__{mr. johnson }
<D>__{well don't you?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i think you should try not to think about this anymore.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{oh. okay. i will try that then.}
