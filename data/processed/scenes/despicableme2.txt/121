<A>__{gru and the yellow minions burst into el macho's backyard. the evil minions give chase.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{up that tree! hurry, hurry!}
<A>__{they climb a tree up to the roof of the house, only to be pursued by more minions up there. and the evil minions have devoured the tree so they can't go back that way either. with no escape, gru and the minions run up a tower until they reach the top a dead end. here come the purple minions. they're trapped. gru kicks them away and the yellow minions try to fight off the purple ones. but they are clearly doomed. and then gru's ship appears hovering above them! modified as a jelly dispensing weapon and with dr. nefario at the controls! the minions hang on the sides holding jelly}
<B>__{blasters.}
<A>__{the ship opens fire on the evil minions, transforming them. pop! pop! pop! pop! one by one they transform back into yellow minions. one of the minions wipes the horrible tasting jelly off his tongue. dr. nefario sticks his head out the side of the ship.}
<C>__{dr. nefario}
<D>__{hello, gru!}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{hey, hey! nice work, dr. nefario!}
<A>__{gru leaps onto the ship.}
<C>__{dr. nefario}
<D>__{i put an antidote in the jelly.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i mean, i'm happy to create an evil army to destroy the world, but nobody messes with my family.}

<D>__{thank you, doctor! now let's go get the }
<A>__{gru looks over to see margo, edith and agnes onboard the ship, holding jelly blasters.}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{hi!}
<A>__{gru is flabbergasted. he turns to nefario.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{you brought the girls?}
<C>__{dr. nefario}
<D>__{yes!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{oh. was that wrong?}
<A>__{gru's ship flies toward el macho, blasting purple minions all along the way. from behind a large jelly gun edith unloads round after round.}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{wooooo! yeeeaaahhh!}
<A>__{el macho witnesses his evil minions being converted back to regular ones.}
<C>__{el macho}
<D>__{oh no! what's happening to my minions?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{gru?}
<A>__{gru turns to nefario and the girls.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{you guys take care of the rest of the minions.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm going to find lucy.}
<A>__{gru leaps out of the ship down to the roof el macho is on. he has two big jelly weapons in his hands. meanwhile the ship flies off with its jelly blasters firing, and comes to land on the ground below. the minions and the girls start jumping from the ship. agnes takes aim.}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{eat jelly, you purple freaks! waaaaah!}
<A>__{agnes' gun is a little too big for her and the kick sends her a bit out of control. but she still manages to hit a number of evil minions. the tide is turning. meanwhile, gru has gone ballistic on the evil minions. blam! blam! blam! blam! he takes the remaining few out. el macho kicks an evil minion at gru, but he manages to hit it with jelly and transform it back to yellow. gru holds his gun up to el macho and gives him a threatening look.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{it's over, el macho. now where is lucy?}
<C>__{el macho}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{let me show you.}
<A>__{he turns to a computer and pushes a button. a fountain stops spewing water and underneath it steel doors open from the ground. and out of them rises a rocket. strapped to it is lucy. tied to a shark with two hundred and fifty pounds of dynamite strapped to her. gru is horrified. he gasps.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{oh, hey gru! turns out you were right about the whole el macho thing, huh?}
<P>__{(unconvincingly)}
<D>__{yay!}
<A>__{el macho calls to gru, brandishing a remote.}
<C>__{el macho}
<D>__{one push of this button and i send that rocket straight into the same volcano where i faked my death. only this time it's for real!}
<C>__{gru}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{dave swoops in on a rope and grabs the remote, tarzan style...}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{tally ho!}
<A>__{but unfortunately he smacks a roof support and drops the remote. it bonks a bunch of minions on the head and lands on the ground. el macho stares down gru. fire in his eyes.}
<C>__{el macho}
<D>__{we could've ruled the world together, gru. but now you're gonna die.}
<A>__{he pulls out a vial of px 41 and drinks it. gru gasps. el macho transforms into a giant, purple, furry creature. he}
<B>__{roars.}
<A>__{gru pulls the trigger on his jelly gun, but he is out of ammunition. he then pulls out the freeze ray and fires, encasing el macho's fists in blocks of ice. el macho growls and slams his fists to the ground, shattering the ice and knocking gru off the platform and onto a scaffolding. gru}
<B>__{screams.}
<A>__{the scaffolding tips over. el macho grabs the scaffolding and holds it above his head, ready to crush gru. suddenly gru pulls out lucy's lipstick taser and fires it at purple el macho! the jolt of electricity has him shaking and dancing and ultimately sizzling and smoking, until he finally collapses on the ground.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{lipstick taser!}
<A>__{lucy smiles at this.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{aw...he copied me.}
<A>__{gru runs off to save her. the minions surround el macho, cocking their jelly guns.}
<C>__{el macho}
<P>__{(dazed)}
<D>__{i am not afraid of your jelly guns.}
<C>__{dr. nefario}
<D>__{oh, this ain't a jelly gun, sunshine.}
<A>__{dr. nefario fires the fart gun directly into el macho's face, causing him to pass out. the minions cheer, firing their jelly guns into the air. one of the minions stands on top of el macho and poses for a big game hunter style photo. dr. nefario smiles for the camera as well. gru runs toward the rocket.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{don't worry about me, gru! i will be fine. i have survived lots worse than this.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{okay, that's not entirely true. i'm actually kind of freaking out up here!}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{don't worry i will get you out of this!}
<A>__{gru attempts to untie lucy. and then sees pollito has walked over to the remote. gru and lucy gasp. the chicken looks at gru and lucy, then pecks the button.}
<C>__{gru }
<D>__{i really hate that chicken.}
<A>__{the rocket blasts off into the air. the minions and girls watch in horror as gru and lucy fly off on the rocket.}
