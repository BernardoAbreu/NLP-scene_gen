<L>__{interior mustang day moving}
<A>__{the sun sets. will cruises back into his own middle class town in suburban maryland. a six pack of budweiser rests in the passenger seat. will stops at a light. checks out a pretty young thing in the jeep beside him. she catches him looking, rolls her eyes. the light turns and the jeep skids away. will self consciously removes his "giorgio's" cap.}
<L>__{interior giorgio's trattoria night}
<A>__{will enters and nods at christopher (40s), the manager. his balding head is nearly translucent from absorbing a day's worth of pizza grease.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{yo, chris. let me cash the fuck out.}
<A>__{will hands over some cash to christopher.}
<C>__{christopher}
<D>__{you have a pretty good shift?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{for sure. i mean, the part where i had to drop off all those pizzas kinda sucked, but the rest was cool.}
<C>__{christopher}
<D>__{oh, yeah? 'cause, i got some kids calling in saying you ripped them off. promised to buy them beer or something.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i actually did buy the beer, but it would have been illegal to give it to them, right? so i'm gonna do the responsible thing and drink it myself.}
<C>__{christopher}
<D>__{that's real funny. but i'm trying to run a business here.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what kind of business promises to deliver anywhere in 30 minutes? it's ridiculous.}
<C>__{christopher}
<D>__{i don't wanna hear another one of your bullshit excuses. you're fired.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{come on. if i didn't need this job, i wouldn't be doing this shitty job.}
<A>__{chris is unmoving.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{fuck! whatever!}
<A>__{will storms off. as he gets to the door }
<C>__{christopher}
<D>__{you know, you were an okay driver half the time. and you're not a puerto rican. which means something to me.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that's poignant.}
<C>__{christopher}
<D>__{i guess i could rehire you, on a provisional basis. of course, this would be at the slightly reduced "new company rate."}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{are you fucking serious?}
<C>__{christopher}
<D>__{i don't know. is there anyone else left in town for you to work for?}
<A>__{will shakes his head. swallows what's left of his pride.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{when do i start?}
