<D>__{god, she's beautiful.}
<A>__{lee glances over her shoulder, then turns from the doorway and walks away. the camera follows her, moving across a book and photograph filled bookshelf that obscures her from view as she walks into a crowded, comfortable vestibule. people, some holding drinks, some just entering the apartment, surround her. everyone is talking at once, carrying on easy, familiar conversation.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{she's got the prettiest eyes, and she looks so sexy in that sweater.}
<A>__{lee smiles at the various people, exchanging greetings.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{hi, how are you?}
<A>__{two more guests enter the apartment; the vestibule is full now. still walking, lee lightly hugs one of the children as she continues on her way towards the living room. elliot's voice, as well as the jazzy music, is heard.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{i just want to be alone with her and hold her and kiss her...}
<A>__{lee walks into the living room, turning her head back for a moment to talk to the child she has just hugged.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{...and tell her how much i love her and take care of her. stop it, you idiot. she's your wife's sister. but i can't help it.}
<A>__{the camera is still moving with lee as she smiles and stops to chat with her mother. elliot's voice, as well as the music, continues over the low din of warm conversation.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{i'm consumed by her. it's been months now. i dream about her. i i, i think about her at the office. oh, lee.}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{what am i gonna do?}
<A>__{lee starts to walk off again, finishing her conversation with her mother. she passes several other guests, then turns to greet april, giving her a warm, brief hug.}

<D>__{i hear myself mooning over you, and it's disgusting. before, when she...}
<A>__{elliot's voice over continues as he is actually seen, standing in a doorway having a conversation with a gesturing, rotund man. both are holding drinks as lee, carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres and two drinks, walks between them. the space is very tight; the men hold up their drinks to make room for her.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{...squeezed past me in the doorway, and i smelled that perfume on the back of her neck...}
<A>__{elliot watches lee walk off; the other man, oblivious, continues to talk. elliot reluctantly returns to the conversation, but he can't help turning his head to gaze at the offscreen lee as the other man chatters on.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{...jesus, i, i thought i was gonna swoon! easy...}
<A>__{the camera resumes following a smiling lee. she has just put down the tray and drinks near april, and briskly and obliviously, she walks past a doorway where elliot, still ruminating, watches her, entranced.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{you're a dignified financial advisor. it doesn't look good for you to swoon.}
<A>__{the camera stays with elliot, who is still watching the offscreen lee. in the background, guests continue to chatter warmly with each other. hannah, carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres, walks up behind the distracted elliot.}

<A>__{the film abruptly cuts to the theater's black and white screen, where the marx brothers, in duck soup, play the helmets of several soldiers standing in a line like a live xylophone. the sounds of the "xylophone" are heard as the movie cuts to the darkened theater, where mickey slowly sits down in a balcony seat. the "xylophone" music stops and changes to "hidee hidee hidee hidee hidee hidee ho" as sung by the marx brothers and ensemble in the movie. the singing continues faintly in the background as mickey continues his tale:}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{and i went upstairs to the balcony, and i sat down}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{and, you know, the movie was a a a film that i'd seen many times in my life since i was a kid, an and i always u uh, loved it. and, you know, i'm, i'm watching these people up on the screen, and i started getting hooked o on the film, you know?}
<A>__{the film cuts back to the black and white movie screen as mickey continues to talk. the marx brothers, as well as the hundred odd other cast members in duck soup, are kneeling and bowing as they sing "hidee hidee ho." they kick their heels up in the air. they sway back and forth, hands clasped, singing "oh h h h h h..."}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{...and i started to feel how can you even think of killing yourself? i mean, isn't it so stupid? i mean, l look at all the people up there on the screen. you know, they're real funny, and, and what if the worst is true?}

<D>__{what if there's no god, and you only go around once and that's it? well, you know, don't you want to be part of the experience? you know, what the hell, it i it's not all a drag. and i'm thinking to myself, geez, i should stop ruining my life...}

<A>__{as mickey continues, the film cuts back to duck soup on the black and white screen. the marx brothers are sitting on a judge's bench, playing banjos and singing with the other cast members. they jump down from the bench, still singing. their voices swell.}

<A>__{the marx brothers kneel, strumming their banjos, and the movie cuts back to central park. the flashback is over. mickey and holly continue their stroll as "you made me love you" begins to play in the background. they pass some people, a cluster of buildings that look like castles, and the manhattan skyline as seen through the trees, as the camera moves back, farther and farther away from them, showing a beautiful central park, frozen in time.}

<A>__{the movie leaves the kitchen and cuts to the doorway between the dining room and the living room. upbeat jazz plays over the low din of the party. two women stand by the partially set dining room table, chatting and arranging some plates, as elliot strolls into view, sipping a drink. he passes the women and walks through the doorway into the living room, nodding hello to a guest who is walking the other way. he enters the living room, smiling. it is crowded with guests; hannah's children play in their midst. one of hannah's boys grabs elliot's arm. they playfully "spar" for a moment before elliot laughingly shakes him off, continuing on his way into a connecting room. he stops at the doorway, looking at the crowd. the camera shows his point of view: guests stand in clusters, enjoying themselves; one woman chats with a little boy; another woman, carrying a drink, walks over to a group of other guests. the film then cuts back briefly to elliot, holding his drink and looking straight ahead, as it shows his point of view once more. this time he sees a smiling lee and doug, talking animatedly; a few guests are seen in the background. elliot's voice is heard over a close up of the couple.}
