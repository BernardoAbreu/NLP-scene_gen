<A>__{a shot of buddy and rose in the waiting room. he is helping her lie on the couch on pillows as she weeps, a hand over her face.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{i gotta find out what they're saying. you lie back and rest, rose, and i will give you a report on it.}

<L>__{interior dr. martinson's home office night}
<T>__{cut to :}
<A>__{a close shot of dr. martinson. an expression of distaste is on his face. the camera pulls back as he talks to mother and daddy.}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<D>__{i'm sorry the truth nauseates you, mrs. hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it i'd like to put to you. this operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that i feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{what do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{go ahead, doctor, i think i am following you.}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<P>__{(gives mother an aloof glance, then to daddy)}
<D>__{first, about the girl's history. evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{go on, doctor.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{yes, go on.}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<D>__{i am thinking particularly of the other ovary. as a rule i don't believe in removing it. the woman's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed, she is subject to possibly serious depression, she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example, her breasts might shrink and become flabby, facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features, and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished, especially in a girl or young woman. for these reasons i am opposed to removing the other ovary, as a rule. do you follow me?}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{i am ahead of you.}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<D>__{then... may i speak quite frankly with you, mr. hillyer?}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{please do.}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<D>__{i have of course observed the girl in treating her.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<D>__{i think we both know her.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{yes, we know her.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{what are you talking about? i don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<D>__{mrs. hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. she is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. it would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. therefore i recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. it is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and i suspect your husband agrees with me.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{reluctantly, i do. it would be a blessing to her and everyone else. the girl is oversexed and i say spay her!}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(slowly rises to her feet and in a trembling voice)}
<D>__{over... my... dead... body!}
<A>__{a long, frozen pause as both daddy and dr. martinson stare at mother in surprise. she stares at the doctor with fire in her eyes. he seems already to shrink a little. finally she speaks with a calm fury.}
<C>__{mother }
<D>__{are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<P>__{(shrinking a little)}
<D>__{illusions, madam?}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{you'd go so far as to mutilate a helpless girl who has no means to defend herself, you'd go that far? don't you think i know what you've just said and don't you think i understand the dreadful and revolting crime you've just conspired to commit?}
<A>__{dr. martinson stares at her in fear and shock, intimidated by the calm fury and ice cold moral indignation. he opens his mouth as if to speak, but no sound comes out. mother turns to daddy.}
<C>__{mother }
<D>__{i thought i knew you. i thought i knew you better, i thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. well, i can't believe what i've just heard in this room. a defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. how could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(slightly shattered)}
<D>__{well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{i can't believe you really meant it, if i did i'd want to die. you aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{well, i... i hadn't thought about it that much. i was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. if you're going to talk nonsense, i don't want to talk to you at all. rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{well, i know, more so. that's why i was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(with a quiet fury)}
<D>__{better off? how could she ever find love and happiness, if you did what you're talking about? are you insane?}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<P>__{(rather feebly)}
<D>__{now, may i say, i am against that particular procedure, as a general rule. but in a case of near nymphomania, it doesn't seem monstrous to me at all, but medically advisable.}
<A>__{both mother and daddy totally ignore him. mother's eyes are fixed on daddy and he is struggling with himself, staring down at the floor.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{well, now, i admit... in rose's case, it would be cruel. if rose wasn't attractive and pretty... well, it would probably be bad for almost any young woman. i don't know exactly what i was thinking about, the doctor said it and it sounded reasonable.}
<A>__{daddy finally looks up at mother and admits his error like a man.}
<C>__{daddy }
<D>__{but you're right, darlin', you're absolutely dead right, it would be an awful and horrible thing to do. i'm sorry, honey, forgive me, i didn't mean it.}
<A>__{mother turns from daddy and walks up to the desk and stares down at dr. martinson as if he is a loathesome bug upon which she intends to step.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{i will not cry like a woman. if i'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. you can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self control as a man. and you get this in your head. if you hurt that girl, i will hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, i will do my level best to ruin you. do you understand me?}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<P>__{(a sickly smile, he is licked totally)}
<D>__{yes, i understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(icy cold)}
<D>__{i understand you perfectly. you leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<P>__{(a foolish smile, as if}
<D>__{mother has paid him some}
<P>__{kind of compliment)}
<D>__{actually of course i won't operate, i don't do major surgery. dr. hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{let him be guided not by my wishes and not by rose's wishes, although i am sure they are identical. let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself, because that is what has spoken through me tonight.}
