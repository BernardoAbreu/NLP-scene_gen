<A>__{the sound of the explosion echoes through the city. shaking the city walls. the nazis are close. indiana stands in the city square. he has assembled everyone for the battle. tyki and the pygmies are armed with bows and arrows, spears and blow pipes. kezure and the pirates hold their swords. scraggy's men carry revolvers and daggers. clare and betsy stand with several gorillas. tyki whispers to scraggy, who translates for indiana.}

<D>__{men...and, ah...women... i...ah... we're about to face one of our toughest opponents... they've got size...hardware...and well, quite frankly...we're the underdogs...}
<A>__{indy's eyes light. a moment of inspiration. the background music slowly begins to rise. indy's voice becomes louder. tougher.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{but...well, if it wasn't for the little guy...where would this country be?...}
<P>__{(excited, louder)}
<D>__{i mean...i knew this little guy once ...a scrawny runt, with thick black glasses and about 300 different kinds of allergies... but this little kid had a dream... he wanted to be on the football team.}
<P>__{(music rises, so does indy's voice)}
<D>__{well, all the big guys made his life miserable...always shoving his head in the drinking fountain...putting mustard in his pants...throwing me ...'er, him!...throwing him in the shower with all his clothes on...}

<P>__{(we hear the nazis}
<D>__{approaching, indy}

<D>__{now let's go out there and show 'em just how tough the little guys are!}
<A>__{everyone breaks into a loud cheer. ready to fight. the sound track music soars. indiana raises his sword. he turns and runs toward the drawbridge. the people follow, as indy leads them into battle!}
