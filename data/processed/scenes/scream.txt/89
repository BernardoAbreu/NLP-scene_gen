<A>__{sidney tears out the door and down the hall, coated in billy's blood.}
<B>__{angle on the ghost}
<A>__{as he catches up with her, grabbing hold of her collar. she pulls away from him...her shirt ripping down the back. her hands find a door knob and she goes for it, pulling the door open...moving quickly inside...locking it behind her.}
<L>__{interior dark space continuous}
<A>__{total darkness. sidney's hands scour the wall for a light switch. the doorknob turns...the lock holds..as the door is nearly shaken from it's hinges...and then... nothing. all goes silent. only sidney's rapid breathing fills the space around her. sidney, trembling, shaking, reaches above her, feeling, until she finds a string. she pulls it...as a lightbulb switches on overhead. she's in a small box of a room. the door is on one side, a small, narrow staircase on the other. she eyes the doorknob, then the staircase...contemplating...but it's an easy decision. there's no fucking way she's going up to the attic. she unlocks the door and pushes on it. but it won't give...she pushes on it again. it's locked from the other side. shit. she turns to the staircase.}
