<A>__{mcconnell is staring at his spacesuit's sleeve. he can see that the suit material is starting to deflate, revealing the shape of his arm, just as it did in luke's greenhouse. he hesitates, then begins to unscrew the sealing ring on his right glove. terri and luke see this.}

<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{jim, what're you doing? you'll depressurize!}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{mcconnell makes the final twist on his glove and there's the hiss of rushing air.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{jim, seal it!}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{no. that was air going into my suit, not out. look at your own suits they're not rigid anymore. we've got pressure in here.}
<A>__{luke looks at his sleeve. mcconnell's right.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{above mars atmospheric? that's impossible.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{we're millions of miles from earth and we're inside a gigantic white face. what's impossible?}
<A>__{terri types on her arm keypad. she's amazed.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{there's six psi in here...}
<P>__{(taps more keys)}
<D>__{nitrogen and oxygen.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{otherwise known as air?}
<A>__{terri nods. mcconnell starts unscrewing his helmet ring. luke follows suit.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{hey, there may be some lethal trace gasses i haven't picked up yet, or... or... oh, the hell with it.}
<A>__{terri starts taking off her helmet. in a few moments, all three helmets are off. they hold them, glowing softly, against their chests, as they breathe deeply and gratefully. air. and then, at this very moment, as if they have just passed another kind of test... high, striated wall appears through the glare, soaring up before their startled eyes. white, metallic, composed of complexly linked bands, plates, ramps. it's part of a structure whose overall height and breadth keep us from understanding its purpose. but the hatch opening slowly in its side, at the top of an approach ramp, is unmistakable. radiant white light streams out from within, forming a glowing tunnel, down towards the astronauts.}
<B>__{the astronauts blink}
<A>__{raising their gloves against the dazzling glow. at the end of this tunnel of light, inside the hatch frame}
<B>__{a shape materializes}
<A>__{and slowly resolves itself into a glowing humanoid form, which we somehow sense is female. she appears benign, wondrous. this glowing martian a holograph regards the astronauts for a few moments, then beckons to them, as if to say "enter." all her motions are both calm and calming precise, unhurried, gracious. mcconnell, luke and terri look at each other. they're awed into silence, and still tense, but now more out of excitement and anticipation than fear. their eyes agree: let's go. they walk forward slowly, carrying their helmets, up the ramp and into the tunnel of light, following the martian, who retreats before them. they go through the hatch and disappear inside.}
