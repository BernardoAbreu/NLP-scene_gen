<L>__{interior grierson's office day}
<A>__{bean and david enter. it's a warm, formal. office. on the wall behind the desk is a full size, framed poster of whistler's mother. on a white background, at the base of the poster, a caption reads: 'the grierson gallery, home of whistler's mother'. elsewhere, the walls are full of paintings. grierson and bernie look up from a computer screen at david and bean, who is, rather weirdly, carrying a newspaper in fronts of his flies. grierson approaches david, and shakes his hand.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{ah, david. finally. (checks his watch deliberately ) and this must be our professor from across the sea.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes, this is doctor bean.}
<C>__{bean}
<D>__{actually i'm not .... er ...}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{this is bernard schimmel. bernie the doctor.}
<A>__{bernie offers his hand. bean has to do a nifty handchange to free up the correct hand for the handshake. the newspaper stays firmly in place.}
<C>__{thomas grierson}
<D>__{ah the tribune mind if i just ....}
<A>__{he reaches out to borrow the newspaper. bean has to squeeze in right next to the desk and sit behind it, before he can hand the paper over thus ensuring the continued invisibility of the wet patch. grierson studies the paper for a second.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{take a seat, gentlemen..... although before we settle feast your eyes on these.}
<A>__{grierson goes to a painting on a wall. david and bean follow bean about one inch from david's back, walking in perfect rhythm.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{arthur rackham. originals of course. got four of them. check this out ... venus and the cat, aesop's fables. isn't that something?}
<A>__{he heads towards said illustration on adjacent wall and bean and david follow, still totally glued together. a strange sight.}
<C>__{david.}
<D>__{they're beautiful, sir.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{maybe. hell of a price, i'11 tell you. anyway down to business.}
<A>__{they head back to the desk but bean, in a momentary lapse of concentration fails to follow. he's now stuck on the wrong side of the room, unable to turn around.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{bernie was just showing me his new ideas for a cross gallery computer system. dr bean would you like to look at this? very exciting stuff ....}
<C>__{bean}
<D>__{ahm ... no.}
<A>__{grierson is slightly surprised. but they persevere.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{what i'm doing, dave, is developing the ultimate user friendly,' interactive public guide to the gallery.}
<A>__{punching buttons on the computer, he reveals wonderful maps of the gallery, and when clicking on sections of the map, graphic explanations of each rooms contents. meanwhile. bean has spotted a fan on the other side of the room. he moves around the room, always facing straight to the wall. when he reaches the fan, he switches it on: unfortunately it's a rotating fan so to keep the wind on his trousers, bean has to do a strange, rhythmic dancing movement, following the arc of the fan.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's very good bernie.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{but the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{not bad, eh? what do you think, doctor? ah.... doctor bean?}
<A>__{bean turns, shocked to have been observed. he looks down at his trousers and, hooray!, they're dry at last. he's delighted, and moves back across the road towards them, hands in pockets, in a big, confident, groin thrusting, dry trouser boasting walk.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{well, thanks for dropping by. enjoy your stay with our vice president and his family. they're simple people. .but warm, yes, doctor?}
<C>__{bean}
<D>__{i'm not actually... um...}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{... settled in yet. i know. plenty of time. bernie, perhaps you'd like to take dr. bean on a tour of the gallery.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{absolutely. this way, sir.}
<A>__{bean displays his crotch proudly one last time before he and bernie exit. grierson tries to fathom the strange man who just left.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{he's a genius, right?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{ah... he certainly has something, sir.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{very pleased you've taken him in, david. at a time when no one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes, although, i really..... thank you. yes, it's great to have him with us. the whole family's very excited.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{glad to hear it. tell poor mr larson to come through, will you?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you're not going to ....}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{sack him? david, what else can i do? this business is not, repeat, not breaking even. and david ... notice anything this morning?}
<A>__{david frowns then sees.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you've tinted your hair? it takes years off you, sir.}
<A>__{grierson beams.}
