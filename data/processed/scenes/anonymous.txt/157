<A>__{ben jonson walks with a manuscript in his hands. he stops for a moment when he sees the new globe theater. workers are still painting the walls. he pauses when he sees a poster in front advertising a performance of "richard iii" on monday nexterior}
<L>__{interior the globe theater day}
<A>__{jonson sticks his head in and takes in the glorious new theater shakespeare and burbage have built. the actor condell is on stage, rehearsing the character of "gloucester". he walks on stage with a limp, and has a large hump on his back. he is a caricature of robert cecil.}
<D>__{"gloucester"}
<P>__{(in character)}
<D>__{but i, that am not shaped for sportive tricks, nor made to court an amorous looking glass...}
<A>__{richard burbage, the theater's stage manager, is watching his performance with spencer and a group of actors. jonson stops and watches the rehearsal for a beat.}
<P>__{"gloucester" (cont'd) (in character)}
<D>__{i, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion, deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time into this breathing world...}
<C>__{spencer}
<D>__{good part, that... "gloucester" ...and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as i halt by them.}
<P>__{(out of character)}
<D>__{is this wise?}
<C>__{burbage}
<D>__{it's only the one performance. go on! "gloucester" i need a drink...}
<A>__{and "gloucester" heads backstage.}
<C>__{jonson}
<P>__{(to burbage)}
<D>__{burbage. wonderful theater. wonderful! the best bankside! but only one performance? is it that bad?}
<C>__{burbage}
<D>__{hardly, it's will's new play. richard the third. we've been hired to perform it free to the public.}
<C>__{jonson}
<D>__{free?}
<C>__{burbage}
<D>__{aye. some anonymous nobleman paid for everything. god knows will never would. been rehearsing all week, just found out this morning, we go up next monday.}
<A>__{jonson thinks a beat that's odd but then holds up his manuscript.}
<C>__{jonson}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{my best so far. i guarantee more than one performance. though i will not pay for the tickets myself.}
<P>__{(winks)}
<D>__{no need to.}
<C>__{burbage}
<D>__{sorry, ben...}
<A>__{jonson looks confused.}
<C>__{burbage }
<D>__{will... he's part owner... i'm sorry ben, but i had to agree no jonson plays at the globe... ever.}
<A>__{jonson is in shock.}
