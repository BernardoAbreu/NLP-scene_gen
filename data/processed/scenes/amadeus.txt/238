<L>__{interior old salieri's hospital room morning 1823}
<A>__{morning light fills the room. old salieri sits weeping convulsively, as the music stops. tears stream down his face. vogler watches him, amazed.}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{why? why? why? why add to your misery by confessing to murder? you didn't kill him.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{i did.}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{no, you didn't!}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{i poisoned his life.}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{but not his body.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{what difference does that make?}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{my son, why should you want all vienna to believe you a murderer? is that your penance? is it?}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{no, father. from now on no one will be able to speak of mozart without thinking of me. whenever they say mozart with love, they'll have to say salieri with loathing. and that's my immortality at last! our names will be tied together for eternity his in fame and mine in infamy. at least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful god!}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{oh my son, my poor son!}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{don't pity me. pity yourself. you serve a wicked god. he killed mozart, not i. took him, snatched him away, without pity. he destroyed his beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. he doesn't care. understand that. god cares nothing for the man he denies and nothing either for the man he uses. he broke mozart in half when he'd finished with him, and threw him away. like an old, worn out flute.}
