<L>__{exterior facing mountain wide shot}
<A>__{hal and gabe lead the "expedition" down a steep, but passable, descent, leading to }
<B>__{a natural stone bridge}
<A>__{that links comb bluff with the next mountain. travers stops gabe and pulls out the monitor.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{okay. connect the dots.}
<A>__{gabe pauses as he holds the monitor up against the mountainscape.}
<B>__{mountain and monitor}
<A>__{the first blip is up a thousand feet it's a wall, and obviously not something for a novice. gabe pauses a little too long qualen nudges him with his gun. gabe hands the monitor back to travers.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{this way.}
<A>__{gabe, with hal right behind, leads them up the wall it's not a straight climb, but there's a series of zig zagging natural ledges that cut up the wall. wide enough even for an amateur. the others follow gabe and hal's example.}
