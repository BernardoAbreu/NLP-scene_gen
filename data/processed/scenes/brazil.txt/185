<A>__{to sam being lead into the middle of the cold, modern chapel which, possibly for the occasion, has been tarted up with some red velvet curtains that help make it a bit theatrical. a large flower smothered coffin rests on some sort of raised stand in front of the altar, a vicar stands in the pulpit, and a fair sprinkling of people sit in stepped seats on three sides of the room. the coffin is closed, but a length of bandage has escaped the lid. standing amidst the floral tributes is a large, rather idealized, colour portrait of mrs terrain looking not so much young as beautiful. among the mourners are drs jaffe and chapman and others in their operating gowns. to enlarge on the scene, we see shirley t snuffling in her hanky and a few others chatting amongst themselves, the vicar standing in his pulpit waiting to get on with it, etc. cut : to sam trying to take all this in, stopping in the middle of the room. don't forget dr chapman sobbing.}

<D>__{at these times of giving and receiving let's remember the greatest gift of all: not a gift to be spurned, not a gift to be opened and carelessly set on one side, not a gift to be taken back and changed, but the gift of eternal life. mrs terrain has just received that most wonderful of all gifts. she came to us physically new, she goes hence from us not so physically new. but the spirit never grows old. and in the domain of the eternal giver, mrs terrain shall dwell in bountiful joy forever.}
