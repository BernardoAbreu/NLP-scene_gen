<A>__{with yorgi hanging on his back, xander turns the rocket upside down and stuffs it back in the launcher. ahab heads down to the bottom of the river, the two men fighting. we see one man get thrown free, the other is caught up on ahab and continues downstream. then the booster rocket fires, giving off sparks and bubbles. it's all in silhouette now as wham! the rocket explodes, setting off a chain reaction. wham! wham! wham! ahab and it's unfortunate passenger are disintegrated by the blasts. the chemicals belch out in harmless clouds.}
