<A>__{needy enters the gym and slams the door shut behind her. people ignore her as she slowly walks toward the stage. they're too busy slow dancing and laughing in their respective cliques. she looks up at the stage, where soft shoulder are playing an insufferably long coda. nikolai noodles through a guitar solo, then looks up and sees needy looking directly at him, her eyes full of hate. nikolai gulps nervously and elbows dirk. needy points to her eyes with two fingers, then points at nikolai, as if to say, gotcha. she looks completely possessed.}

<D>__{look at her.}
<A>__{dirk takes one look at needy's face and takes off his guitar. nikolai motions for the rest of the band to leave the stage. the music stops abruptly. the kids in the gym murmur and complain, confused. needy tries to follow them. she limps blindly toward the stage and climbs up. everyone watches, gasping in horror. by now the band is disappearing out the side door of the gym.}
