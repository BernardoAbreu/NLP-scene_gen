<A>__{clay sits in a straight backed chair, smoking a cigarette and sipping his scotch. whale sketches from a wing chair across the room.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{storm's getting worse.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{"a perfect night for mystery and horror. the air itself is filled with monsters."}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{that's from your movie, right? "the only monsters are here."}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i don't remember that one.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{james whale. this afternoon at the party.}
<A>__{whale looks up.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "the only monsters are here." i was wondering which here you meant.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i don't recall. memories of the war, perhaps.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{but that was so long ago. it can't still bother you.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh, but it does. especially in light of the journey i'm about to make.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you're planning a trip?}
<A>__{whale's gaze remains dreamy and preoccupied as sounds of battle fill the room. a relentless rat a tat of gunfire. the whistling of bombs. the tortured wailing of dying men. whale stands, moves over to the window.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{barnett. barnett on the wire.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{your friend?}
<A>__{whale gazes out at the storm. from his pov, we see a scarred and barren landscape, illuminated by occasional flashes of lightning.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{he caught his one night coming back from the reconnoiter. i wouldn't take him out, but mcgill did. just to give the lad a taste. they were nearly home when a maxim gun opened fire.}
