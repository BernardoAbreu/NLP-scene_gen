<A>__{he goes.}
<C>__{bembry}

<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i ain't never seen a cat like you. ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?}

<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you the only cat don't come on with that "whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{i respect myself. a man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{tell you this: you ain't no fool.}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{don't con me. don't try...}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{okay, okay.}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{don't con me.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what do you do with your time?}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{i read. i study. because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. respect his body and his mind. quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{that's what mama used to say.}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog.}
<A>__{malcolm has been pondering all this and now grows animated as he thinks he has come to the essence of a hustle.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{come on, daddy, pull my coat. what happens if you give all that up? you get sick or somethin'? i pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft.}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{i'm telling you god's words, not no hustle. i'm talking the words of elijah, the black man's god. i'm telling you, boy, that god is black.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what? everybody knows god is white.}
<C>__{bembry }
<D>__{but everything the white man taught you, you learned. he told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. he told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. and you believed him. he taught you to worship a blond, blue eyed god with white skin and you believed him. he told you black was a curse, you believed him. did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?}
