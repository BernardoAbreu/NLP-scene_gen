<D>__{get paige, grab a blanket.}
<A>__{ lynn darting into a bedroom, scooping paige out of her bed.}
<L>__{interior back bedroom mobile home night}
<A>__{sam coming in, moving to a metal gun locker in the corner of the room, pulling out a shotgun.}
<L>__{interior living room mobile home night}
<A>__{the wind slamming the trailer now lynn and paige terrified watching as sam moves to the center of the room, points the barrel of the shotgun toward the floor and boom! boom! boom! boom! blows four gaping holes in the floorboards, then starts to kick through the wood with his boot }
<C>__{lynn}
<P>__{(yelling, over the wind)}
<D>__{what are you doing?!}
<A>__{he kicks a hole in the planks, turns to lynn and paige }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{get in!}
<A>__{paige crawling through the opening... into a shallow trench underneath the trailer... lynn squeezing in behind her... sam staying outside... no room for him... the trailer starting to buck violently in the tempest... thin walls contorting around him... ... and paige starts to cry terrified sam laying down on the floor next to the opening, close enough so she can hear his voice...}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{bug, you hear me?! bug?!}
<C>__{paige}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{and he starts to play a child's word association game with her... something she knows... something they've played before...}

<A>__{and we hear her tiny little voice say...}
<C>__{paige}
<D>__{whale.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{good job, bug, good job! you said whale, i'm thinkin of a pail!}
<C>__{paige}
<D>__{you said pail, i'm thinkin of a tail.}
<A>__{and so this little game goes between father and daughter... paige listening to his voice... in the midst of this terrible storm... somehow becoming less terrified.}
