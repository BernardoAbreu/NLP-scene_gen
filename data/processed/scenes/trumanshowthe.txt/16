<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(into receiver)}
<D>__{...this isn't about insurance, this is about the great variable when will death occur? could be a week, a month, a year. could happen today...a sunbather, minding his own business, gets stabbed in the heart by the tip of a runaway beach umbrella...no way you can guard against that kinda thing, no way at all...}
<A>__{the prospect on the other end, unimpressed with his pitch, hangs up. truman's supervisor, lawrence, younger than truman by several years, sharper suit, sharper haircut, appears around the corner of the cubicle.}

<P>__{(conspiratorial)}
<D>__{they're upping our quota. you need this.}
<A>__{lawrence exits the cubicle. truman's head drops. he picks up the framed picture of his wife from his desk. meryl, early thirties, a petite woman easy to mistake for frail. he deposits the photo in his briefcase and departs.}
