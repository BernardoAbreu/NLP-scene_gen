<L>__{exterior hill day}
<A>__{gasping with exhaustion, willow staggers up a sloping hill and drops to his knees. his eyes brighten. in the distance he sees a junction marked by a high wooden scaffolding.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{that's it. the crossroads...}
<A>__{he stands and heads toward it cautiously.}
<L>__{exterior crossroads day}
<A>__{the place is disgusting. littered with junk, buzzing with flies, plagued with rodents. willow creeps toward the scaffolding, covering his face against the stench. from it hang two cages. in one is a heap of filthy rags. in the other a half clothed skeleton with one bony arm dangling out. willow unpacks the papoose and looks up the deserted road. he shivers with cold.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i hate this.}
