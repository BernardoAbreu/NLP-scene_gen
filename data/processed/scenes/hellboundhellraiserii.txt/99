<L>__{interior corridors labyrinth}
<A>__{julia is leading malahide down a corridor which has intersections every few yards on both of its sides. julia walks past these shadowed entrances without pause, without a single sidelong glance. she is clearly confident, clearly back on her own turf. malahide, on the other hand, glances nervously into every one before moving on. there is also one last portal he looks into. he is gazing into a room where the floor is a vast, seething pool of maggots. suddenly, something breaks the surface. it would doubtless scream were its mouth not full of maggots. it is browning. his nightmare has come true; his skin is producing the maggots in a constant, spewing flow from numerous sores that pack his face. malahide turns away and calls to julia.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{enough. god, that's enough. we have to go back.}
<A>__{julia smiles at him.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{go back? what an earth makes you think we can go back?}
<A>__{malahide's jaw drops.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{i want to go back!}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{sorry, friend. no day trips to hell. here you are. here you stay. and forward the only way to go.}
<A>__{julia turns back and walks an down the corridor. malahide, with a glance back at the maggot pool, turns after the now departing julia.}
