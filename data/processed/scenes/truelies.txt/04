<L>__{exterior canal and boathouse night}
<A>__{a dock extends into the frozen canal, just behind a large boathouse. there is a faint chipping sound. the ice breaks quietly, and the pieces are slid back. a head appears, in a rubber drysuit hood. the diver slips the regulator out of his mouth and turns slowly, scanning... revealing: harry tasker. our hero. harry floats with just his eyes above the surface, silent as a water snake, as a guard passes on a footpath nearby. after a few beats harry slips out of his tanks and fins, letting them sink, and climbs the frozen ladder onto the dock. he moves like a ninja into the shadows of the boathouse. opening a waterproof bag, he pulls out a walky talky.}
