<L>__{exterior balcony}
<A>__{jenny steps out onto the high rise balcony. she steps up on a table and stands on the edge of the balcony. a busy street lies many stories below. jenny looks down to the intersection below. she slips over the edge, regains her balance, turns and looks back at the intersection below, and begins to get down from the edge. jenny grabs a hold of the ledge and carefully climbs down. she sits down on a chair. jenny rocks back and forth as she cries. she looks up at the sky.}
