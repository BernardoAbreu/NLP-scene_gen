<L>__{interior storage room}
<A>__{vince and joey enter a storage room that is cluttered with boxes. christy is tied to a chair in the back of the room, with willy standing guard over her. christy sits very calmly, despite the anger she is in. she seems distinctly nun like in her radiant serenity.}

<C>__{vince}
<D>__{babe, what happened here? look at you.}

<D>__{good evening, vincent.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{what, vincent? this is me, doll. i know you. what did you think you were doing? running to the cops. hiding out. no, no. you're sorry now, aren't you?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{i am sorry for all my sins. and yours.}
<A>__{vince, willy and joey all look at each other, perplexed.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{she's a nun, vince.}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(kneeling by christy)}
<D>__{i love you, chris. i always will. i gave you so much. my time. my affection. a big time career. and how do you repay me? what's the thanks i get? where's the loyalty, huh? where's the love?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{you will be judged, vincent. we all will.}
<A>__{vince stands; the charm hasn't worked. he's getting angry.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{what do you mean judged? i don't get judged, baby.}
<C>__{vince }
<D>__{and who are you to talk? you were nothing. you couldn't even sing. i must have been out of my mind.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{she's acting weird, vince. ever since we picked her up.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{it's spooky. it's like she ain't even afraid or nothing.}
<A>__{vince grabs the front of christy's habit and squeezes it tightly around her throat.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{she's afraid. come on, tell the boys you're afraid.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{i feel sorry for you, vincent. and i forgive you.}
<A>__{this really throws vince, and angers him further. he glares at christy, and then releases her. he turns to joey and willy.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{who gives a damn? waste her.}
<A>__{joey and willy look a little unsure as vince storms out of the room.}
