<L>__{exterior grounds, alpine grove}
<A>__{starks leans down seemingly oblivious to the cold and lifts some snow to his mouth, tasting it like a man who needs to affirm he is still alive. he's so rapt that lorenson's voice takes him by surprise.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{hey. you're not supposed to be out here.}
<A>__{starks stiffens as he realizes he could be in the place where his body was found. the terrible question asks itself on his face: is this when starks is killed?}
<D>__{starks [turning around sharply] what are you going to do to me?}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{well...}
<A>__{as lorenson reaches into his pocket for something, starks anxiously holds his breath. it's black when it comes out and... a ski hat when it opens up. starks lets out his breath, relieved.}
<D>__{lorenson [nonchalantly] i thought i'd just ask you to come back inside with me.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{and if i didn't want to come?}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{i guess i'd ask you why.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{because i don't think i'm crazy.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{you're not crazy.}
<A>__{starks is surprised by lorenson's agreement.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{you suffer from delusional disorder. that doesn't mean you're... crazy. it just means you're confused. and you're here, instead of in jail, because that was determined to have played a role in your killing of a police officer. starks [correcting him] alleged killing of a police officer.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{you were convicted of the crime.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{that conviction doesn't convince me of anything. until i know that i did it, i'm not going to accept that i did.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{you may never remember at all. [beat] your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{no. the real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. not my mind.}
<A>__{lorenson seems to realize at least for an instant that he is looking at a desperate man who is persuasively, and cogently, staring back at him.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{[beat] william, i'd like to ask you something if i can.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{since when do people around here have to ask permission to do anything? lorenson [suspiciously] how's your treatment progressing with dr. becker?}
<A>__{starks still doesn't know how much lorenson knows, and if he should trust him.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{fine. [beat] why made you ask?}
<A>__{lorenson answers first with his eyes looking over starks' body. starks merely stares back tersely.}
<D>__{lorenson [carefully] i just hope you'd let me know if that wasn't the case.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{why, what would you do?}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{i could try to...make it stop.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{no. i don't want it to.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{so it's helping? starks [choosing his words carefully] [beat] it's making me feel like a different person.}
<A>__{lorenson sensing she's not going to get any more from starks turns around to go back inside. it's only as she turns her face away from starks that we see how nervous she is. but you'd never guess it from her tone...}
<D>__{lorenson [casually] you comin'?}
<A>__{starks looks towards the fences locking him in from every direction. lorenson waits until she hears starks' footsteps following her. she waits until starks has reached her.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{you should be careful. you could be killed if they found you out here.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{believe me, i know.}
