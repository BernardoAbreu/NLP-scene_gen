<L>__{interior ruby's house continuous}
<A>__{picard enters and closes the door behind him. it's dark. he fumbles around for a light switch... finally locates one... and a soft, golden glow fills the room. the house has only one room, which functions as a living room, kitchen, bedroom, etc. this is also ruby's darkroom. the windows have been painted black, and there are photographic plates and futuristic photo equipment all around. but the most striking feature of the house are the large, hanging cloth printed photographs. they vary in size and shape. some are hanging on walls, others hang from the ceiling in mid air, still others are stacked on the few pieces of furniture that's here. the absence of paper has forced ruby to print photos on anything she can find bed sheets, shirts, pieces of upholstery, backs of carpeting, etc. picard stands there for a moment, taking in the scene he's never been in anyplace quite like this. the cloth photos give the room a feeling of a small, intensely personal gallery. picard moves around the room, looking from photo to photo... hunting for the elusive shots of the missile silo... and as he does, we get our first close look at ruby's images, and they tell us a great deal about her... she has an artistic eye for finding beauty in the mundane and the ugly. there are pictures of hope amidst despair... beauty amongst devastation. there seems to be a theme running through the photographs a romantic, almost idealistic sense of optimism. at one point, picard finds a photograph he recognizes. it's the rusted out hover car she photographed on the streets of resurrection. it's an ugly, decrepit piece of junk... but there in the center, spot lighted by a single ray of sunshine... is a tiny flower about to bloom. picard takes in the image for a brief moment... then pushes onward... goes to a file of photos sitting in a box... begins sorting through them quickly... we see pre war photos printed on real paper. they show a younger ruby with her parents... resurrection the way it used to look... ruby with a dog... picard pauses, frowns... gets the odd feeling that someone is watching him. he turns around to see...}
<B>__{himself}
<A>__{a three foot photograph of picard is drying in the air behind him. ruby must've taken the photo when picard was on the street talking to scrimm. it was taken through a telephoto lens, a close up of picard's face he looks focused, determined, heroic. it's a remarkable shot of the captain, and even picard is a little taken aback by the image. she's captured the essence of the man. click clack! the sound of a shotgun being cocked. picard freezes... slowly turns around to see who's there...}
<B>__{rubby}
<A>__{is standing in the open doorway, a shotgun leveled at picard.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{you should pay closer attention to those little red lights.}
<A>__{picard glances down at the doorway, sees the flashing red light in the doorjamb. he's busted.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{you know, i'd be perfectly justified in shooting you right now.}
<A>__{picard glances at the photograph of himself.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i'd say you already have.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{don't flatter yourself. i take pictures of a lot of junk.}
<A>__{she perches herself on the arm of a small couch, holds the gun loosely, but never taking the aim away from picard.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{okay, let's hear it. i'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{we're trying to repair doctor cochrane's ship. it's been damaged and }
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{we?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{myself... and a few other friends of zephram's.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{friends from cornell...}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{some.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{lie. that's one. keep going.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{a key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.}
<C>__{ruby}
<P>__{(considers)}
<D>__{all right. truth. i believe that one. why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{we have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{or...?}
<A>__{picard has to come up with something decides to throw her off with a high tech explanation.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{or the shielding around the plutonium core will begin to deteriorate. within a day, the entire silo will become so radioactive that no one will be able to come near it for a hundred years.}
<A>__{ruby eyes him evenly.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{lie. that's two. one more, and i pull the trigger.}
<A>__{picard is starting to get angry.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{why are you being so difficult? all i'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. it'll take five minutes.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{and all i'm asking for is the truth. that would take five minutes.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{for all i know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal zephram's ship.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i am not a thief...}
<A>__{ruby's had enough her temper flares and she gets off the couch, takes a threatening step toward picard.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{no, you're a petty burglar and a liar...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you're no friend of zephram's. he is a great man. he's not like you or me or any of the other zombies walking around this town.}
<A>__{picard jumps in with a quiet, forceful quality:}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{no. he's a man with vision. he can see beyond the problems that surround us. he knows there's a better future out there for everyone... a future where crime, poverty and war are things of the past... a future where we reach out and seek our destiny in the stars.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i believe in that future, too, ruby. i believe in it in every fiber of my being. and i'm telling you... if we don't launch that warp ship tomorrow, there's a very good chance that future will never happen.}
<A>__{she eyes him for a moment and we're not sure if his words have had any effect. ruby still has her doubts, but decides to go with her gut...and finally hands him the photographs. picard glances through them his expression tells us the photo he needs is in there.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{you won't regret this.}
<A>__{they share a look... and then picard turns and walks off into the night. ruby watches him go... and we can see on her face a confused jumble of mixed emotions. something about that man has touched her...}
