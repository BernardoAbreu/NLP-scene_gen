<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(calm, serious)}
<D>__{it's okay. it's okay. don't look down, just look at me.}
<A>__{jack reaches slowly down and removes the second of two rudimentary ice skates, leaving him barefoot on the surface of a familiar frozen pond. and now we see what he sees, a girl of about four (with an uncanny resemblance to jamie's sister sophie) stands in her skates, rooted to the spot. a spider's web of cracks emanates from where she stands.}
<C>__{jack's sister}
<D>__{jack, i'm scared.}
<A>__{cracckkk! the ice below her splinters more. she wobbles as it starts to separate.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i know, i know...but you're gonna be alright. you're not gonna fall in. we're gonna have a little fun instead.}
<C>__{jack's sister}
<D>__{no we're not!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{would i trick you?}
<C>__{jack's sister}
<P>__{(fighting back tears)}
<D>__{yes! you always play tricks!}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{well, alright. well, not, not this time. i promise. i promise, you're gonna be...you're gonna be fine.}
<A>__{jack fixes her gaze...holds it...there's nothing but the two of them.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you have to believe in me.}
<A>__{jack's sister pauses a moment, then smiles through her fear. and just like that, jack's demeanor changes. a light is switched on inside him and the last thing that could be happening is what is actually happening.}
<D>__{guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 103.}
<C>__{jack }
<P>__{(casual, playfully)}
<D>__{you wanna play a game? we're going to play hopscotch! like we play every day!}
<A>__{jack's sister looks more reassured.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{it's as easy as...one...whoaaaa...}
<A>__{and jack shows his sister the first leap, but mugs for her, almost losing his balance then catching himself. she laughs.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{two...}
<P>__{(the next jump)}
<D>__{three!}
<A>__{he turns toward her with his arms spread out.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{alright...}
<A>__{he reaches down to pick up a familiar looking stick lying on the ice. he extends it towards her }
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{now it's your turn.}
<A>__{jack's sister looks down. she is trying to gather her courage. jack, never breaking his gaze with her,}
<C>__{jack }
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{one...}
<A>__{she hops, wobbling, but catching her balance.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that's it, that's it...two...}
<A>__{she's almost there, jack's staff just beyond her reach.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{three.}
<A>__{she grabs hold of jack's staff and in one massive effort he slings her with all his might to safety. but the movement propels him into the cracked ice. he looks up to see his sister safe smiles and then plunges into the dark cold water.}
<D>__{guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 104.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{whoa...}
<C>__{jack's sister}
<D>__{jack!}
<A>__{jack falls back into the icy water. splash!}
<C>__{underwater}
<A>__{we're looking up at the hole in the ice, descending into the dark icy depths...then the full moon appears from behind the clouds as jack's hands claw through the water towards it, but it's helpless. the moon glows bright...brighter... jack's body begins to glow, bathed in moonlight. push in on his face, becoming brighter and brighter until his brown hair turns white and jack's bright blue eyes flash open }
