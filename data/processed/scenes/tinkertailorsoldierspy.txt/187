<C>__{jim prideaux}
<D>__{come in, roach.}
<A>__{roach walks in.}
<C>__{jim prideaux }
<D>__{thought you were in sick bay? what are you...}
<A>__{he stops, seeing the anxiety on the boy's face.}
<C>__{jim prideaux }
<D>__{what is it, jumbo?}
<C>__{roach}
<D>__{sir there's a stranger parked down on the road. he's just sitting there.}
<A>__{he dissolves into tears. prideaux crouches beside him.}
<C>__{prideaux}

<D>__{it's alright, old fella. don't cry. nobody ever watched like you, did they? off you go, now.}
<C>__{roach}
<D>__{are you going to have to leave?}
<A>__{prideaux stares at him.}
<C>__{jim prideaux}
<D>__{i will be fine. you get back to bed.}
