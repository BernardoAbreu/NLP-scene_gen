<L>__{interior foreign office day}
<A>__{in a nice room. malcolm is with michael, suzy and a couple of other civil servants.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{so, my lovely friends, bottom line...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i hate that phrase. we're not in retailing}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{sorry michael, i promise never to use it again.}
<P>__{(mor e)}
<C>__{mal colm }
<D>__{bottom line, is that the president is going to the un, and the pm would like us to join him. this will be the voe to commence military action. so, rob, innis,}
<P>__{(to toby)}
<D>__{little bo cock jockey}
<P>__{(to judy)}
<D>__{and the leaky fucking mingebox, return to your desks and prepare for some extreme briefing.}
<A>__{two civil servants get up and exit. judy walks across the room and starts making calls, as does toby. michael walks off into the next room, suzy follows. they start calling.}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{now then, you still got doubts, complicated simon?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{what the fuck, malcolm. this is all going to spin along from here and we have a vote and we go to war. we fight people, and kill them, and our kids get killed, and that's exactly the sort of thing i didn't want to do when i went into politics. that's the opposite of what i want to be doing.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{that's why you've got to stay in government. in here you can influence things, delay things. out there you're just another mad shouty fucker people don't want to make eye contact with. remember mary? she took a stand over health. everyone decided she was mental.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{only because the sun showed a photo of her with wide eyes and her head on a cow.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i found that a very powerful image.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{look, the prime minister of this country is not a viking. he doesn't drink blood, he doesn't go round biting tramps. he doesn't go to chequers at the weekend for a bit of light raping and a pub lunch.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i know the prime minister isn't a viking, malcolm.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{unlike me, the man abhors physical violence.}
<P>__{(mor e)}
<C>__{mal colm }
<D>__{he's a grade a fucking pussy and he knows you have similar concerns and he wants your input on this. yeah?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{where's the intelligence? where's the hard evidence?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{listen, we've got evidence harder than a diamond dildo. we have intelligence so deep and hard it would fucking puncture your kidneys.there's an informant, `ice man', ok? the stuff he's giving us? it'll make your blood run cold. and clot. your insides will turn to black pudding.}
<P>__{(lowering his voice)}
<D>__{...now, certain box lickers are sitting on it. but you're going to see it, because the pm regards you as a key player now.}
<A>__{judy's mobile goes.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{judy molloy? (beat) ten minutes. thanks.}
<P>__{(to simon)}
<D>__{prime minister wants to speak to you in ten minutes, simon. he want you to go the un.}
<A>__{malcolm's heading out.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{see you're a list now. you're a kennedy. in the vip lounge, with the gold card and the complimentary drinks and the hard on.}
<A>__{malcolm leaves. a beat.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(shouting to malcolm)}
<D>__{show me the evidence, malcolm, that's my fucking bottom line.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{so do you still want...nods and winks?}
<A>__{simon nods a little nod. then shakes his head slightly. then nods a slight nod again.}
