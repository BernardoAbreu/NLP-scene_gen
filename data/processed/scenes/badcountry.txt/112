<A>__{the door to one freight truck rolls to the top, revealing a converted assault weaponry showcase. below covered scaffolding, both crews stand. guns bulge through their coats. no talking. no sudden movement. shiites watch jesse and catfish examine the merchandise: semi automatics, shotguns, carbines, sub machine guns... everyone looks at each other. jesse acknowledges worth. catfish pulls a large canvas bag from the van, filled with cash. as he carries it toward a bench, a large shiite (omar) reaches for the bag before catfish can set it down... ...both men hold tight. neither letting go. and there's a moment.}

<A>__{omar reaches for the bag of cash... blam! catfish fires, point blank, shooting omar in the face. and world war iii erupts. ab's fire. shiites return fire. from several stakeout locations, atf agents deploy and open fire. jesse is grazed in the shoulder, slips, staggers runs. shiite #1 fires three shot bursts at ab #1, who's blown apart. a generator and atf #1 collapse. atf #2 and #3 with pump shotguns open up on the ab's van. naseem, over a mercedes roof, fires a burst at atf, then swings onto ab #2 and fires, killing him. naseem jumps into the mercedes, yells at the driver to go. buzz rapid fires, hits shiite #1 in the back. shiite #1 is spun around and buzz shoots him in the head. catfish fires into the lot... hitting shiite #2. in the mercedes, driver floors it. atf re emerges, kneels and pumps shots into the mercedes. jesse has taken off, past the lumber storage. catfish and buzz follow, breaking for the freight truck. in the mercedes, driver is blown apart by atf. the car crashes into a dumpster, knocking naseem out. jesse, catfish and buzz jump into the freight. atf fires. windows explode. shiite #3, trying to climb in is shot down. jesse, behind the wheel... burns rubber pulling out of the stop, over and through a scaffold, collapsing it. the freight truck draws everyone's fire. jesse pilots it through the chaos. scaffold dragging behind. sparks fly. jesse's pov: where he's going. an opening in the construction, leads back to the highway and oncoming traffic. atf cars speeds in, the opposite way... as the vehicles pass: jesse and atf lock eyes. and the freight makes the highway, scattering traffic, to the sound of ongoing gunfire...}
