<LOC>__{INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING (PRESENT DAY)}
<ACTION>__{LOUISE is a waitress in a coffee shop.  She is in her early- thirties, but too old to be doing this.  She is very pretty and meticulously groomed, even at the end of her shift.  She is slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus tray underneath the counter.  It is making a lot of RACKET, which she is oblivious to.  There is COUNTRY MUZAK in the b.g., which she hums along with.}
<LOC>__{INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING}
<ACTION>__{THELMA is a housewife.  It's morning and she is slamming coffee cups from the breakfast table into the kitchen sink, which is full of dirty breakfast dishes and some stuff left from last night's dinner which had to "soak".  She is still in her nightgown.  The TV is ON in the b.g. From the kitchen, we can see an incomplete wallpapering project going on in the dining room, an obvious "do-it- yourself" attempt by Thelma.}

<DIAL>__{Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.}
<CHAR>__{LOUISE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.}
<ACTION>__{Thelma has the phone tucked under her chin, as she cuts out coupons from the newspaper and pins them on a bulletin board already covered with them.  We see various recipes torn out from women's magazines along the lines of "101 Ways to Cook Pork."}

<DIAL>__{He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?}

<CHAR>__{THELMA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll call you right back.}
<ACTION>__{Thelma goes through the living room to the bottom of the stairs and leans on the banister.}
<CHAR>__{THELMA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Darryl!  Honey, you'd better hurry up.}
<ACTION>__{DARRYL comes trotting down the stairs.  Polyester was made for this man, and he's dripping in "men's" jewelry.  He manages a Carpeteria.}

<CHAR>__{THELMA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.}
<ACTION>__{Darryl is checking himself out in the hall mirror, and it's obvious he likes what he sees.  He exudes over-confidence for reasons that never become apparent.  He likes to think of himself as a real lady killer. He is making imperceptible adjustments to his over-moussed hair.  Thelma watches approvingly.}

<DIAL>__{No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.}
<CHAR>__{THELMA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.}
<CHAR>__{DARRYL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am.}
<ACTION>__{He's finally ready.  He walks to the door and gives Thelma the most perfunctory kiss on the cheek.}
<CHAR>__{THELMA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.}
<CHAR>__{DARRYL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{See ya.}

<CHAR>__{LOUISE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<LOC>__{INT.  THELMA'S BEDROOM - CLOSEUP - SUITCASE ON BED - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Going into the suitcase is bathing suits, wool socks, flannel pajamas, jeans, sweaters, T-shirts, a couple of dresses, way too much stuff for a two-day trip.  REVEAL Thelma, standing in front of a closet, trying to decide what else to bring, as if she's forgotten something.  The room looks like it was decorated entirely from a Sears catalog.  It's really frilly.}
<LOC>__{INT.  LOUISE'S BEDROOM - CLOSEUP - SUITCASE ON BED - DAY}
<ACTION>__{A perfectly ordered suitcase, everything neatly folded and orderly.  Three pairs of underwear, one pair of long underwear, two pairs of pants, two sweaters, one furry robe, one nightgown.  She could be packing for camp. REVEAL Louise.  Her room is as orderly as the suitcase. Everything matches.  It's not quite as frilly as Thelma's, but it is of the same ilk.  She is debating whether to take an extra pair of socks.  She decides not to and closes the suitcase.  She goes to the phone, picks it up and dials.  We hear:}
<CHAR>__{ANSWERING MACHINE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{Hi.  This is Jimmy.  I'm not here right now, but I'll probably be back 'cause... all my stuff's here.  Leave a message.}
<ACTION>__{Louise slams down the phone.  A framed picture of Louise and Jimmy sits on the table next to the phone.  She matter-of- factly slams that face down, too.}
<LOC>__{INT.  THELMA'S BEDROOM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Thelma is still throwing stuff in, randomly now.  She talks to herself quietly the whole time. She is taking stuff off of her nightstand, a small clock, fingernail scissors, etc. She opens the drawer of her nightstand.  Her attitude is purposeful; she looks as if she knows exactly what she's doing; although, frankly, she has no idea, and each decision is completely arbitrary.  As she rifles through it, plucking various items from among the jumbled contents, we see there is a gun in there, one Darryl bought her for protection.  It is unloaded, but there is a box of bullets.  She picks up the gun like it's a rat by the tail and puts it in her purse.}
<CHAR>__{THELMA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(muttering to herself)}
<DIAL>__{Psycho killers...}
<ACTION>__{She grabs the box of bullets and throws them in, too.  She tries to close her suitcase, but there is stuff hanging out all over the place.  She stuffs things back in the sides and heaves all her weight against the top.}
<LOC>__{EXT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Louise's green '66 T-Bird convertible pulls into the driveway of Thelma's house.  The garage door goes up and Thelma is standing in the garage with all her gear.  A suitcase that looks like it might explode, fishing gear, a cooler, a lantern.  Thelma's car, a beat-up gray Honda, is parked in there, too.  Louise gets out of the driver's seat.}
<CHAR>__{LOUISE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.}
<CHAR>__{THELMA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.}
<CHAR>__{LOUISE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{In case of what?}
<CHAR>__{THELMA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.}
<CHAR>__{LOUISE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(going along with her)}
<DIAL>__{Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.}
<CHAR>__{THELMA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.}
<ACTION>__{They load everything into the car.  The trunk barely closes. Thelma heaves all her weight against it.  They get into the car and pull out of the driveway.  As they drive down the street, we hear Thelma let out a long howl. She is laughing and she sticks her arms straight up in the air.}
<LOC>__{EXT.  CAR - DAY}
<ACTION>__{They are driving down the interstate.  Thelma reaches for her purse and finds the gun.}
<CHAR>__{THELMA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Louise, will you take care of the gun?}
<ACTION>__{Louise shrieks at the sight of it.}
<CHAR>__{LOUISE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why in hell did you bring that?}

<CHAR>__{THELMA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, come on, Louise... psycho killers, bears... snakes!  I just don't know how to use it.  So will you take care of it?}
<ACTION>__{Louise reaches over and takes the gun out of Thelma's purse and holds it in her hand.  She tests the weight of it, and then puts it under the seat.  Thelma puts the bullets under the seat. They are speeding off down the highway with the RADIO blaring. Louise puts in a TAPE of wild R&B MUSIC.}
<CHAR>__{THELMA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Whose place is this again?}
<CHAR>__{LOUISE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.}

<DIAL>__{Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.}
<CHAR>__{THELMA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, he has never let me go.  He never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun.  All he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing God only knows what.}
<ACTION>__{They are both silent for a minute.}
<CHAR>__{THELMA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(looking straight ahead)}

<DIAL>__{...never mind.}
<ACTION>__{A huge semi-tanker carrying gas passes them on the highway and HONKS.  The mud flaps are the shiny silhouettes of naked women.  There is a bumper sticker on the back that says: "Lick you all over -- ten cents."}

<DIAL>__{One of your friends?}
<ACTION>__{Thelma is watching herself in the side mirror, pretending to smoke a cigarette. THELMA'S POV OF A SIGN alongside the road that reads "See you in church on Sunday!" Thelma pushes in the lighter and waits for it to pop out. Louise gives her a sidelong glance, but does not say anything.}

<LOC>__{EXT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{They pull off at a place down on the right all lit up with neon.  It's called the SILVER BULLET.  The sign flashes COCKTAILS -- BEER -- DANCING -- FOOD.  There is a huge gravel parking lot with lots of pickup trucks and older cars.  Even though it's early, you can tell this place is a real night spot.  It's already pretty crowded.}
<LOC>__{INT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{This place is jumpin'.  There are ten pool tables with crowds all around.  The long bar is filled with customers. There are tables and booths.  The room is dense with smoke. There is a dance floor, but no one is dancing yet because the band is still setting up.  There are a lot of single men.  Many heads turn and follow Thelma and Louise to an empty table.}
