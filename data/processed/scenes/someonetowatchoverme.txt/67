<L>__{interior mike's bedroom day}
<A>__{afternoon sunlight spilling in as mike awakens to the sound of a car motor, faltering, then "chug chugging" to another start, gasping, then revving. someone's working on mike's car. he looks at his alarm clock; it's 4:00 in the afternoon.}

<L>__{exterior mike's backyard day}
<A>__{ellie and tommy visible only as fragments as they work on mike's car. ellie is seen as a rear end in blue jeans, the rest of her inside the hood; she calls to tommy to "try it again". it looks like no one's behind the wheel; but the very top of his head can be seen as he strains to reach the accelerator. angle on mike: appearing at the door, in a freshly pressed suit, a steaming cup of coffee in hand. he walks across the lawn towards them.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{hey! what the hell're you doin' to my car?}
<A>__{ellie emerges from underneath the hood, flushed.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{changing the sparks. they showed it on tv. what d'you think?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i think television's a dangerous thing.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{it's twenty bucks in the bank.}
<A>__{slamming the hood. tommy revs the engine ellie moving down the steps towards mike.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{enough, tommy! c'mon. get out of there!}
<A>__{ellie moving towards mike, she slipping her hand into his underpants: their eyes meet, lovingly. she laughs.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{hey. the neighbors.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{let 'em eat their hearts out.}
<A>__{she retrieves her cold coffee cup from the potting table, checks out the picture of claire in the newspaper, he's left there. mike adjusts his tie. it's very colorful.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{i read the article. you didn't tell me she was so beautiful.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(mister honest)}
<D>__{well, actually, she looks better than that.}
<A>__{ellie playfully makes a move, jabbing at him, mike stops her, ending with a hug.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i've got to go.}
<A>__{mike kisses her. ellie holds mike's face with her gloved hand.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{see you tommy.}
<A>__{angle on ellie: as tommy comes up and leans against his mom: both watching mike primp, they share on the joke. mike turns, his face with grease on it.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{okay?}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{unbelievably handsome. you look fantastic in a suit.}
<C>__{tommy}
