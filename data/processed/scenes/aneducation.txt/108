<L>__{exterior street david's house. day}
<D>__{a suburban street, full of semi detached houses, not far from jenny's house. jenny walks down the road tentatively she's looking at the numbers on the houses. she looks young again tired, no make up, no elegant clothes. she can't bring herself to wear anything that david bought her. she hesitates at the top of the driveway to the house, steels herself to walk down. but just at that moment the door opens; there's a homely looking woman, early 30s. she is holding the hand of a three year old. jenny is stunned. but there's more to come.}
<A>__{the woman deposits the child in the drive, goes back into the house, comes out behind an enormous 1950s pram. david has found time to father another baby.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{oh. hello.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(almost inaudible)}
<D>__{hello. i'm sorry. i think i must have the wrong house.}
<A>__{the woman stares at her.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{yes. i wanted number...it's my cello lesson. silly. i...}
<A>__{she dries up and looks at the woman helplessly.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{oh, no. don't tell me. good god. you're a child.}
<A>__{jenny blushes. beat. she turns and tries to walk back up the driveway, but the woman won't let her go.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{no. no. you stay here. if you're old enough to sleep with him, you're old enough to look at me.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i can't.}
<A>__{but she doesn't move, either.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{you didn't know about any of this. presumably.}
<A>__{jenny shakes her head.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{no. they never do. did he ask you to marry him?}
<A>__{jenny nods.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{yes. of course he did. you're not in the family way, are you? because that's happened before.}
<A>__{jenny shakes her head.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{thank god for that. at least you}
<P>__{can escape intact. (beat)}
<D>__{relatively speaking. not all of them have done. she nods at the children.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{that's why he never goes through with anything. he does love them.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(looking into the pram)}
<D>__{she's beautiful.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{thank you. he. (bitterly) he's four months old. jenny does the maths. it's all she can do to stop herself from reeling backwards she's visibly shaken.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{four months!}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{yes. babies often are that sort of age. perhaps you can remember a night four months ago when he seemed a little distracted. anyway. if you'll excuse us. she pushes past jenny and leaves her standing bereft on the path.}
