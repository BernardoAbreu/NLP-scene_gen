<A>__{day.}
<L>__{81c terminator replies in a matter of fact tone.}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{everything.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{cool.}
<A>__{sarah looks at terminator, still not quite believing this is happening. but this is a different sarah than the waitress of 1984. she spends only a second or two dealing with the unbelievable. then she turns to john in the back seat.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{he nods. she reaches for john and we think she's going to hug him. she starts to rub her hands over him and we realize she's checking for injuries, very clinically the way a vet checks a dog for broken bones. he pulls away from her. he hates her always checking him, treating him like he might break, like some piece of rare china.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i said i was okay.}
<A>__{sarah looks at him, exasperated and stern.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{it was stupid of you to go there.}
<A>__{john stares at her, surprised.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{goddamnit, john, you have to be smarter than that. you're too important! you can't risk yourself, not even for me, do you understand? i can take care of myself. i was doing fine. jesus, john. you almost got yourself killed.}
<A>__{we see his chin quiver. he's a tough kid, but all he really wants is for her to love him. he hasn't had enough years on the planet yet to be the man of steel she demands.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i... had to get you out of the place... i'm sorry, i...}
<A>__{his face crumples. he starts to cry. sarah gives him a cold stare.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{stop it! right now! you can't cry, john. other kids can afford to cry. you can't.}
<A>__{he's trying to be brave, he really is. terminator turns and sees the water leaking from his eyes. it doesn't make and sense to him.}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{what is wrong with your eyes?}
<A>__{john turns away, ashamed. sarah lets her breath out, realizing how keyed up she is. she turns to terminator, giving him a wary once over.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{so what's your story?}
