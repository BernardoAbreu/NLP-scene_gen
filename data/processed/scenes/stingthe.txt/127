<B>__{the drugstore again}
<A>__{it's 12:56 and hooker is worried. he looks up to see two large men, obviously racket goons, come in the front door, and take a seat facing him in the next booth. they stare at him impassively, waving the waitress away when she comes to take their order. hooker knows they're lonnegan's men, but is somewhat unsettled by the fact that lonnegan is not with them. suddenly, a voice.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{carver?}
<A>__{hooker turns around to find that lonnegan is seated in the booth directly behind him. his bodyguard is in the one behind that.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{you should always look to the back too, kid.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(sliding out of his booth and into lonnegan's)}
<D>__{i was afraid you weren't gonna come. we haven't got much time.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<P>__{(curtly)}
<D>__{get on with it then.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(pointing to telephone)}
<D>__{sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.}
<P>__{(pulling out a wad of bills)}
<D>__{all you do is take this two grand across the street to shaw's place and bet it on that pony. there's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time. we only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{you're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{this is just a test. the big one comes later. be careful with that though, it's all i got.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{and you were gonna pay me back?}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{i am after this race.}
<A>__{lonnegan says nothing. he's not sure he likes a man who's stupid enough to bet his last dollar on a horse race.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{i gotta get back before shaw misses me. good luck.}
