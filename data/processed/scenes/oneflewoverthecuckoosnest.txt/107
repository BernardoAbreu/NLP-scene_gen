<D>__{come on, get over there!}
<A>__{mcmurphy allows himself to be led to the heavy security partition, by the men's dorm, where all the patients are lined up. it is morning and the day room is a mess: a few chairs turned over. paper cups and empty bottles. puddles of cough syrup, orange juice and apple juice worked into sticky masses. rose sits by herself on the couch. bromden is the last one led to the lineup, where big nurse waits.}

<D>__{thank you, mister washington! mister mcmurphy, do you know where billy is?}
<A>__{mcmurphy shrugs "no."}
<C>__{big nurse }
<D>__{mister harding, have you seen billy?}
<A>__{harding shrugs "no."}
<C>__{big nurse }
<D>__{mister sefelt...}
<A>__{big nurse's question is cut off as all the patients and attendants turn their heads toward the hallway and start laughing. big nurse turns to see turkle, without his shirt on, walk into the seclusion room and close the door behind him. big nurse turns and starts down the hallway, the laughter trailing after her when, suddenly, the laughter breaks off as big nurse stops and in the silence, she opens the door.}
