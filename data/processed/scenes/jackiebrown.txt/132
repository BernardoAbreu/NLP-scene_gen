<A>__{he's outside; nobody's stopped him. he keeps walking towards his blue seville. he keeps walking unhurriedly, never looking back. he gets to his car, uses opening the car door as an excuse to look back at the mall. it's normal. nobody's after him, nobody's watching him. he made it. it worked. max allows himself a smile, gets into his cadillac with his half a million bucks and drives away.}
