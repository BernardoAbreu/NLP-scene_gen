<A>__{tracy studies his face, searching... all the guests wait with bated breath... the groomsmen wince, come on come on come on... then, unable to be mad at doug, tracy smiles and kisses him. he kisses her back. the guests all sigh in relief. the groomsmen exhale, whew. vick and alan covertly knock fists. the minister clears his throat.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{we, um, we traditionally wait til the end for the kiss...?}
