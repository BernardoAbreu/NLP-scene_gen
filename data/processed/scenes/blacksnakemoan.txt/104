<A>__{clank! the fear in laz's face is replaced with a grin as he watches his radiator hold firm.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{somebody help me!}
<A>__{outside, rae bucks and screams, yanking on the chain like a wild mustang. her bare feet and legs are soiled with fresh mud and grass as she claws at the ground. laz crosses to the radiator and pats it like a proud parent his wedding ring clicks against the iron.}
