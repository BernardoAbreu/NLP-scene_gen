<L>__{interior kate's office day}
<A>__{she is, we will find, a top prosecutor for the common wealth of virginia. her office is a zoo. on her desk, a baby picture of kate and her mom smiling but there is something a little different about it. seth enters and they shake. he glances around sees the photograph, glances away. kate has risen now and in the silence it's clear that even though they are both standing still, they are both circling.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(trying for a smile)}
<D>__{for a tough prosecutor, you don't resemble your reputation, miss whitney.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(the same)}
<D>__{is that good or bad?}
<C>__{kate }
<P>__{(before seth can reply)}
<D>__{look, lieutenant i told you on the phone, i'm simply not involved with my father, so this may not be a waste of time for you, but it sure is for me.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{what would you do if i just turned around and left?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{report you as an incompetent.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(a real smile now)}
<D>__{you're exactly like your reputation, miss whitney }
<A>__{as they head out }
