<L>__{interior estate cecile's guest room day}

<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{who is it?}
<C>__{kathryn }
<D>__{it's kathryn.}
<A>__{cecile bolts up and unlocks the door. kathryn stands there with a worried look on her face.}
<C>__{kathryn }
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{kathryn enters and locks the door behind her. cecile is crying.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{calm down. tell me what's wrong.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{something awful happened last night.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{what do you mean?!}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{i... i don't think you want to know.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{cecile, you have to tell me.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{it involves your brother. he... took advantage of me.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{does your mother know?}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{if she knew, she'd kill me. it happened at your house last night.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{why didn't you do something?}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{so, let me get this straight. you came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{well... not exactly.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{he made you give him a blow job.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{well what then?}
<A>__{cecile waits a moment, then whispers in her ear.}
<C>__{kathryn }
<D>__{he ate you out?}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{if that's what you call it.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{cecile, i think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{what do i do then?}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{well did you like it?}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{well... i don't know it was weird. at first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. then, i started getting really hot and then i started shaking and then like, i don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one.}
<A>__{kathryn laughs.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{cecile, you had an orgasm.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{i did?}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{i'm so proud of you. you're becoming a woman.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{i am?}
<A>__{kathryn nods. cecile embraces her, happy.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{now listen. now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. think of sebastian as a tutor. let him instruct you.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{i don't love him. i love ronald.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{so? don't you want to make ronald a happy pappy? practice makes perfect, cecile. my advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{but that would make me a slut.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{wouldn't it?}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{cecile, everybody does it. it's just that nobody talks about it.}
<A>__{cecile takes the information in.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{it's like a secret society.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{that's one way of looking at it.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{cool.}
