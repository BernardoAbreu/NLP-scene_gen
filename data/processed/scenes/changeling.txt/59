<L>__{exterior collins house continuous}
<A>__{ as dr. tarr strides onward, the police officer and "walter" walking alongside as christine brings up the rear. a few houses down they come to a group of children playing.}
<C>__{dr. tarr}
<D>__{hello, children, my name is dr. earl w. tarr. i'd like to ask you some questions. 1st kid my mom says we're not supposed to talk to strangers.}
<C>__{dr. tarr}
<D>__{good boy. quite right. but as you see i'm with the police, so it's all right. now, i'm sure you know mrs. collins here, and her son, walter. how many of you recognize this young boy as walter collins?}
<A>__{he looks from one child to the other. they don't reply. either they don't recognize him, or they're intimidated.}
<C>__{dr. tarr}
<D>__{now, now, no need to be afraid. surely you knew walter, and played with him? so which of you can identify walter for me, for his mother, and for the police? this officer would want you to do the right thing as good young citizens.}
<A>__{the kids exchange a glance. it's clear they don't recognize the boy, but they're intimidated by the presence of tarr and the police officer. a few reluctantly raise their hands. another of them goes to "walter," who is shorter than he is. changeling a true story}
<D>__{2nd kid walter was as tall as me....}
<C>__{dr. tarr}
<D>__{yes, precisely. he was as tall as you. now he's not. he's lost a little height, you see. it's a thing called trauma. with luck, none of you will ever have to find out about it yourselves. so other than that, do you recognize this as your friend, walter collins? 2nd kid i guess...}

<C>__{dr. tarr}
<D>__{already ahead of you, mrs. collins; children can be intimidated. but not adults. shall we try a neighbor?}
<A>__{he heads off again, like some very tall, strange bird marching down the street. christine exchanges a look with the kids, then heads off to follow.}
