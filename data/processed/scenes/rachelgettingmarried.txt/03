<A>__{the station wagon travels through a constantly changing series of environments as they journey out of new york city on their drive to suburban connecticut. right away though, kym lights up a cigarette and paul and carol crank their windows.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{so are all these busy young wedding helpers staying at the house? because after eight months of constantly revolving cell mates and crazy people...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you weren't in a cell, kym...}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{...and groups groups groups...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{...and nobody was crazy, nobody was in a rubber room...}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{...i was looking forward to a little privacy for once.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{the only extra person staying at the house is emma, who's actually been staying in your old room. but she can move, i guess.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{rachel and emma. oh, great. how relaxing.}
<C>__{kym }
<D>__{the only two people on the planet less capable of delegating than hannibal! on the eve of a wedding! nachtmare.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{nachtmare?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it's a nightmare so bad it's in german.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{rachel must be totally freaking out. is she too tense?...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{she's a wigwam!}
<C>__{kym}
<P>__{(right on top of him,}
<D>__{rifling through her bag}
<P>__{again)}
<D>__{...is she eating? or are all her latent food issues rearing their heads? is she hoarding snickers and cool whip under the bed like in high school? she never did put that one to sleep.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(genuine)}
<D>__{i don't think that that's a problem for her.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{no offense, dad, but you never thought that was a problem for her. i'm kidding. it'll be great to see her. foodies are the worst, though. they never get it together. there were six of them on my floor in the hospital and you could never get into the bathroom. they would cry at the chocolate pudding and one of them was a guy. i can't wait to see mom.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you'll see her and andrew at the rehearsal dinner tonight.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{can we stop at the 7 11 please? i feel nauseous. i need something to drink.}
