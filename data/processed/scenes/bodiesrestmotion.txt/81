<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(hushed)}
<D>__{the moment's gone.}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{it can go on as long as we want.}

<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(skeptically)}
<D>__{have you ever been in a relationship?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{i was married... but it wasn't really a relationship.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{you weren't married...}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{two years. right out of high school.}

<A>__{a flicker of loss crosses his face.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{no. not by me...}
<P>__{(looking to beth)}
<D>__{i didn't go look.}
<A>__{beth stares at him, uncertainly. he leans up and gently traces circles on beth's skin.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{she wanted to meet someone new. i asked her "why?" she said, "because he won't know me from before. just now. just what i am now."}
<A>__{beth looks to him, puzzled.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{i knew her... on playgrounds... in sunday school... all those grades i knew her as she changed. but she was still the same person. all the times i knew her, she was still her.}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{she can't get away from that.}
<A>__{he holds beth tightly.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{you stay in one place, and all those things that are you... are there. she didn't understand that if you leave, they're still there, in you but they stop being clear. you stop knowing who you are, and what you want.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{you've stayed here and you know who you are?}
<A>__{he moves away from beth.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{i see the lawns i mow, houses i've painted, faces i know... my parents... and i'm constantly reminded of who i am.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{and you know what you want.}
