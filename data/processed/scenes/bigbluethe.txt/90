<A>__{jacques puts his nose clip on. he puts his hand on the gueuse. closes his eyes and inhales slowly. then he takes a sudden last breath, nods, the technician releases the gueuse and in one flashing movement, he disappears.}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{the gueuse slides down the cable. jacques hangs on like a ribbon in the wind, past a marker, 90 feet down. above him, the boat disappears from sight. he moves faster and faster... through a sea that looks like a cloudy sky. the light fades rapidly around him. below, white spotlights pierce an ocean dark as night. jacques reaches them in a matter of seconds. turns the brakes, brings his machine to a halt, 180 feet down. the medics are waiting for him there. they take his pulse. check his eyes... 15 seconds... normal... the bubbles from there scuba tanks churn the water around them... jacques closes his eyes... a tap on the shoulder, he releases the brake on the gueuse. plunges further, this time into pitch black. below him a faint spotlight glows on the bottom. he reaches it and the dark diver moves to him. jacques brakes his machine. moving very slowly, turns his body right side up. like a sleep walker, jacques starts to take the plaque off the plumbline... pauses in the middle of the gesture. the dark diver flashes the high sign to jacques, thumb and forefinger touching, fingers extended, all clear. jacques does not respond. the diver repeats the signal. jacques does not respond. the diver taps jacques on the shoulder... a beat... and then jacques responds, thumb and forefinger touching okay. slowly, reluctantly, he wraps his hand around the handle of the balloon. the dark diver quickly turns the handle for him. the balloon inflates. jacques hangs on... lets it carry him up. at the plague marking 210 feet, jacques lets go of the the balloon. with a burst of speed, it darts toward the surface. jacques follows slowly, undulating like a fish... he's getting warm now... he closes his eyes. passes the medical control without stopping... without even seeing it like someone asleep. he's moving faster now, toward the warmth, toward the air. jacques opens his eyes, watches the lights grow brighter. the silhouette of the boat comes back into view. 60 feet to go.}
