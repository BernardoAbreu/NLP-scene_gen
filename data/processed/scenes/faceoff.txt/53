<A>__{up above central security the prison's nerve center with video feeds and monitors designed to keep problems and privacy to a minimum. the two deputies react to walton's call. identifying archer and dubov's signature blips they throw the appropriate switches and... zap! the magnetic boots lock both inmates to the floor. dubov flails hopelessly but archer's just out of reach. crack! walton punches archer in the diaphragm.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{what? he started it!}
<A>__{walton smashes archer harder he hits the floor.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{when i get out of here }
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{you'll what?}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{i'm going to have you fired.}
<A>__{his statement is so ludicrous, walton laughs. everyone does. from the inmates' reactions, archer knows he's been accepted.}

<P>__{(to dubov)}
<D>__{that's two strikes, dubov. one more and you know where you're going.}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{back to your 'suites' or no dinner.}
<A>__{as archer drops into the line of cons he spots pollux waiting for him. girding himself for this first encounter he's got a plan.}
<C>__{pollux}
<D>__{hey, bro...}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{ pollux?}
<C>__{pollux}
<D>__{of course it's pollux, what the fuck's wrong with you?}
<A>__{archer stares feigning confusion until walton prods him forward. pollux watches his "brother" go very concerned.}
