<L>__{exterior zoological compound}
<A>__{a miniature zoo. the peaceful compound is surrounded with small man made lakes and palm trees. there are countless metal cages, filled with various animals. the tigers, lions, gorillas and other violent creatures, are kept behind bars. but the llamas, giraffes, deer and various tame animals are free to roam the compound grounds. indiana enters with clare, betsy and scraggy. the persistant betsy is annoying indy. she attempts to snuggle closer to him. indiana pushes her away. betsy tries to hold his hand. indy shakes her loose. scraggy watches all of this, giggling to himself. we hear singing. a high, pitched beautiful voice. clare walks to the far end of the compound, toward the singing. the others follow. betsy walks by bonzo, a large chimpanzee. as betsy passes, the chimp catches a familiar smell. bonzo begins to follow betsy. clare opens the door of a large metal cage. here, the singing is louder. clare enters the cage. indiana follows. scraggy blesses the cage, then enters. betsy moves to go inside, but bonzo's large hairy hand reaches out and grabs betsy! pulling the girl off screen!}
