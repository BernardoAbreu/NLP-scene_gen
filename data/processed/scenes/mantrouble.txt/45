<L>__{interior campus rehearsal room night}
<A>__{joan and lewie stand in the doorway of the rehearsal room. (a portion of the chorus membership are seated in chairs, and some, including eddy revere and helen, show occasional interest in the intense exchange taking place at the door:)}
<C>__{lewie}
<D>__{i'm extremely concerned about this situation. i don't want you living alone up there.}
<A>__{she regards him suspiciously. he modulates his voice to a more persuasive and intimate tone:}
<C>__{lewie}
<D>__{now come on, wouldn't you feel much safer if you moved back into our house?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{no, i wouldn't feel comfortable about doing that.}
<C>__{lewie}
<D>__{come here...}
<A>__{he takes hold of her arm and moves her out into the hall:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{darn it, lewie.}
<C>__{lewie}
<D>__{what? are you afraid of your responses to me?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{tch...}
<C>__{lewie}
<P>__{(amorously)}
<D>__{why are you resisting?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{these are very upsetting, really shitty circumstances i'm dealing with and i...}
<C>__{lewie}
<D>__{do you know how hard all this has been on me? do you think it's that easy for me to admit i want you back?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{couldn't you spare yourself then?}
<C>__{lewie}
<D>__{are you seeing anybody? just tell me that.}
<A>__{she rolls her eyes, sighing impatiently.}
<C>__{lewie}
<D>__{come on, you're not the abstinent type.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{please, don't judge me by your scrotal excesses, lewie.}
<C>__{lewie}
<D>__{i know you're seeing somebody.}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(suspicious again)}
<D>__{are you spying on me?}
<C>__{lewie}
<D>__{come on. be open about it.}
<P>__{(kisses her}
<D>__{on the neck,}
<P>__{then)}
<D>__{who is it?}
<A>__{her gaze meets helen's, who, misconstruing the situation, makes an "ok" sign, delivering her semiotic sanction to the happy reunion in the hallway.}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(back to lewie)}
<D>__{alright, i am seeing someone, okay?}
<A>__{he pulls back, narrowing his eyes at her:}
<C>__{lewie}
<D>__{i don't believe you. who is it?}
