<L>__{interior museum afternoon}
<A>__{marie stands aghast at the sight of her diamonds, in a million tiny pieces on the museum's marble floor...}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{fakes, i'm afraid. made of glass. can't believe they were our top attraction all these years...}
<A>__{every muscle in marie's body contracts...she stands before the empty diamond exhibit case, runs her fingers over the portrait of her mother cradling her as a baby.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{that's my inheritance is it, mom? goddamn christmas ornaments...}
<A>__{and as the disbelief gives way to anger she rips the portrait from the case and tears it to shreds...}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{marie, please...}
<A>__{there's no stopping her now. red faced, she lashes out at the display case with a devastating kick, the glass shattering...}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{marie, stop this instant!}
<A>__{she continues her rampage regardless, ripping a fire extinguisher from the wall and hurling it through another display case...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{i hate you, mom! i'm glad you're dead!}
