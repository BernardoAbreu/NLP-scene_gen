<A>__{hazel, gus, and frannie ride in the back of a yellow cab.}
<C>__{cab driver}
<D>__{americans?}
<C>__{frannie}
<D>__{we're from indiana.}
<C>__{cab driver}
<D>__{indiana. they steal from the indians but the keep the name, yes?}
<A>__{hazel and gus share a look.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{something like that.}
<A>__{meanwhile, the landscape outside is flat and dusty, with dirt tracks and the occasional concrete building. in other words, it looks more like indianapolis than holland.}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(to the driver)}
<D>__{this is amsterdam?}
<C>__{cab driver}
<D>__{yes and no. amsterdam is like the rings of a tree. it gets older as you get closer to the center.}
<A>__{soon enough, the cab takes an off ramp and turns a corner and suddenly, it's as if they're transported not only to another universe but to another time as well. we see multi colored row houses lined on both sides of a windy canal. houseboats float against the edges and everyone rides bicycles down cobblestone streets. they're astounded.}
