<A>__{an eerie carboniferous forest dawn dew drips from strange multi leafed plants. giant dragonflies buzz and hum to and fro. bubbles rise from a still pond, and weird lungfish move onto the land. (the third one out carries a little suitcase.) camera pans past the lungfish to a muddy shore. with a dramatic musical sting, we discover a set of strange, hideous clawprints. the camera follows these, then widens to reveal the make of these footprints: a seven foot tall and fearful beast we will call the xenosaurus. it looks around menacingly. (oddly, it's carrying a canvas sack, but we don't stress this.) suddenly a garbage truck appears out of nowhere and runs over the xenosaurus.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{dazed, the xenosaurus gets up. as it does, we realize that we aren't deep in some primeval forest, but on the shoulder of a gravel highway. a stone road sign reads bedrock 1 2 mile. rock vegas, babylon & eden next three exits. now, the camera cranes up above the sign and we see bedrock! nestled incongruously in a savage landscape, the charming protosuburbia gleams in the dawn's early spielberg light. the xenosaurus grabs its sack and some silverware spills out. then it runs off into the bushes and out of sight.}
<B>__{with that garbage truck}
<A>__{it reaches the crest of a hill where there's a "welcome to bedrock" billboard which bears greetings from the rotary club, the chamber of commerce, and (of course) the loyal order of water buffaloes. the garbage truck guys drop their feet down through the floorboard and trot over the rise, coast down to the street below. the driver yanks a wooden brake and the truck stops, and the rear guys hop off. one of them waves to }

<A>__{who returns the wave, then takes a four pack of stone bottles out of his milk truck, heads towards a doorway. as the milkman drops off the milk, he passes a big tortoise with trash cans on its back. the tortoise nods familiarly to the milkman, then it waddles down the curb, camera following. the garbage men take the cans off the tortoise's back, dump them into the truck.}
<B>__{rear of truck}
<A>__{ revealing that the back of the truck is actually a giant jawed creature strapped onto the chassis. the garbage men dump the cans into its maw... it happily swallows the works, licks its lips, belches.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{the garbagemen slam the cans back on the tortoise, who winces as they drive off.}

<A>__{it waddles back up the lawn... passing by a wooden "lawn timer" box which now pops open. inside the box is a "roostersaurus" which crows and flaps its wings. the motion of the wings knocks loose two round stones which roll down two long troughs a la rube goldberg...}
<B>__{following the round stones}
<A>__{they reach the ends of their respective paths, dislodging a stick... that releases a coiled rope which in turn spins a turntable which holds a little wooly mammoth. as it begins to spin around, it squirts water out of its snout. elsewhere on the lawn, other spinning mammoths repeat this performance. after a moment, they gradually slow their revolutions. the one closest to the house scrunches its trunk with a groan.}
