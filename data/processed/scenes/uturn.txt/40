<L>__{exterior apache leap day}
<A>__{on a blanket on the ground, bobby and grace make love quickly, hotly, her dress pulled up, his pants down. but grace is troubled and pulls out, further frustrating bobby.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{no...stop! i can't!}
<A>__{her eyes withdraw into another dimension, as she hikes her dress back up. bobby comes out of his own head, feels the distance between them.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what's the matter?...grace?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{don't feel like nothing.}
<A>__{he finishes relieving himself behind a tree, puts his pants back on.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{get out of town, bobby, as quick as you can.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{grace, i've been fucked over too many times, by too many women. you're becoming the queen of hot and cold.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you'd never understand.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{try me.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it's just such a mess. with jake i mean...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{nothing i understand better than a mess.}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{jake was with my mom after my real dad died.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you mean the shaman?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{he was a shaman...in the mine. we had nothin' after he died. jake took us in, gave us a little money. he used to call me his "little halfbreed"... he kept mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. he had kids in phoenix i think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{...he was raping me the whole time...for years. he loved to do things to me. believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?}
<A>__{the dominoes are tumbling for bobby.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you're sick too...he loved to do things to me. control me. my mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. she become alcoholic...and the funny thing is i liked it. i liked being controlled by jake. the truth was as far out and crazy as he got, i wanted more . i wanted to go all the way. women say they don't want to be taken like, really taken that's bullshit they do. the first time he finished with me, he said i was a woman now. i was 14. then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. it's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... they found my mom right down there (points) at the bottom of apache leap. she had cactus needles stuck all over her body and virgil...sheriff potter said she was drunk and went insane. but i will never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. she was born on this earth and she loved it. she was like me. she just wanted to fly away.}
<A>__{bobby is quietly stunned. a whole world has opened up to him; and he isn't sure yet where the story ends. there is some force at work here, beyond his control.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{after he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when i saw her body, i swore to her on my soul that some day i'd get jake for what he did to her...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i'm sorry...}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{yeah. what do you want. life, right?}
<P>__{(shrugs, stoic) have you ever been to}
<D>__{california?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{is it far from here?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{oh yeah. it's far, it's another world.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{is it pretty?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{oh yeah. it's beautiful, beautiful beaches. blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{would you take me with you?}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{i wish i could.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{please. i won't hang on you. as soon as we get there you can dump me. i don't care. i just want to get out of here.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{honey, baby, i can't . i can't even get out of here myself . believe it or not, i need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{darrell? you know he and jake are...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you don't have any money put away, do you?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{...you could get me money. i will get you out of here.}
<A>__{she looks at him.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{there's money. a lot.}
<A>__{the words hang there, thick between them.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{jake hides it. in a safe. in the floor. in the bedroom. he counts it. he loves to sit there and count it.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{at night. he just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. i heard him. my mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. maybe more.}
<A>__{bobby's eyes widen in hope.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{in cash ?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{oh yeah. there's nothing else with jake. he don't trust banks. he keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. he loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. i never seen it but i know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{one hundred thousand!? that son of a bitch.}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{if it's in a safe we'd have to get the combination }
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it takes a key. he keeps it on himself all the time. i mean all the time . it scratches up against me when we do it.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{if the key's on him, how do we get the key?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{kill him.}
<A>__{spoken almost innocently, it hangs there between them. a silence.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i can't kill, grace. i can't kill anybody.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it's not like he's a young man, bobby. he's had time to live. it'd be quick. i mean, he wouldn't even have to feel it...}
<P>__{(seductively) i mean, sometime in the}
<D>__{middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...}
<A>__{grace lays her hands on bobby, starting to caress him. he bristles and freezes with fear and disgust.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{shit! listen to you... are you crazy, grace?}
<A>__{he abruptly pulls away.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{jesus christ! i think this place is making me crazy. i was crazy to come back here and see you. i'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and i'd sure as hell be crazy if i spent another minute with you.}
<A>__{grace rises, covering her nakedness, shooting a hand to his face, like she did when she read his fortune.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{but it's in you, bobby. i see it. i see death. it's in your heart. let it out for me. let it out...}
<A>__{he's mesmerized. then:}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{do it for me, bobby, you'll never regret it. i promise you. i will do anything for you. anything .}
<A>__{bobby pauses, terribly torn.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i...take me back to town...}
<A>__{he turns away, towards the jeep. grace has a tone of desperation in her voice.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you need the money, bobby. it's a lot more than $100,000. a lot more. how are you going to get out of here? you need the money. whatever it takes, bobby, remember?}
<A>__{bobby walks past the jeep, on his way back to town alone.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{where you going? i will give you the ride...come back! bobby? it's three miles.}
<A>__{bobby doesn't look back. her eyes drift backwards into her solitude.}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{bobby?...whatever it takes.}
