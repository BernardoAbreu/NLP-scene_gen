<L>__{exterior mouth of the tunnel perpetual twilight}
<A>__{everyone is sheltering from the storm. the winching equipment stands abandoned. but a lone digital counter is still flashing away measuring the depth to which the team have descended. 1,980 ... 1,990 ... 2,000. they have reached the bottom.}
<L>__{interior ice grotto 2ooo feet below}
<A>__{in contrast to the deafening storm above, underground, everything is calm. silent. lex lights a cool blue flare, illuminating a scene of surreal beauty. they are in an ice grotto, surrounded by giant stalactites and stalagmites made of frozen glacial water. everything around them shimmers and pulses in the light of the flare. the walls are translucent. up ahead, the grotto opens out into a bigger ice cave. a vast ceiling vaulting off above them into the darkness. no telling how big this place is.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{let's get those lights up.}
<C>__{connors}
<D>__{any second now.}
<A>__{max's men are already unpacking multiple sets of portable floodlights. they begin hooking them to power cables which run back up the tunnel to generators on the surface.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{i don't understand...}
<A>__{weyland looks around the grotto, breathless from the descent.}
<C>__{weyland }
<D>__{no equipment. no sign of another team.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{well this tunnel didn't dig itself.}
<C>__{connors}
<D>__{we have power!}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{let's light her up.}
<A>__{as one, multiple banks of powerful floodlights kick in. the sudden reflections from the glacial ice are blinding. angle on lex shielding her eyes. slowly she lowers her hand. sebastian turns to see what lex has seen. he stops dead in amazement. we still don't know what they have seen. but whatever it is, it's breathtaking. one by one, the camera tracks past the team members. each one is slack jawed. and slowly the camera pans around to reveal the pyramid, towering above them. the hundreds of stone steps covered in shimmering blue ice crystals. the team look like tiny ants standing before it. two thirds of the magnificent structure is fully visible, the rest is buried in the translucent walls of the ice cave. it's an awesome sight.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{congratulations, mr. weyland. looks like you'll be leaving your mark after all.}
<A>__{lex and weyland share a look. despite being short on breath, weyland cracks a broad smile and turns to the group.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{thank you all for this.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{let's make history.}
