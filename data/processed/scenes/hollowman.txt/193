<L>__{interior laboratory day}
<A>__{linda breaks in the room to see frank slicked in blood, his throat cut, and matt bleeding from multiple stab wounds with an extension cord around his neck being pulled tight.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{jesus!}
<A>__{linda rushes over and slams into matt. they fall to the ground. linda crawls over to matt, but her head snaps back and her lips erupt with blood.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{figured it out? you were always so clever.}
<A>__{matt's pulled back across the lab by the cord around his neck. he grabs at the cord trying to breathe. linda watches him being pulled away.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{she clamors over to him. but matt rises in the air and is tossed against the lab table. linda levels her dart pistol and fires haphazardly at the air. she hits nothing but objects jerk and move in a line as sebastian heads for cover. linda manages to grab matt and pull him to her.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{hang on!}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{get out of here!}
<A>__{linda pulls matt toward the door.}
<C>__{linda}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{you won't get away with this. they'll find out about you. they'll hunt you down.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{the villagers with their torches? lock up your daughters! sorry, lin. it's not gonna happen that way.}
<A>__{linda hits the lights. the lab is now very, very dark.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice }
<D>__{see, i've spent all my time down here thinking up this plan. when they find you, they'll find a pile of charred corpses. the result of a terrible accident, i'm afraid.}
<A>__{linda reacts to the voice as it grows nearer. she navigates the maze of equipment, heading toward the crack of light at the front door.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{how can you be so brutal?}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{i guess because i don't have to look at myself in the mirror anymore}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{remember that first night i was out? i did something bad, just to see if i could get away with it. and when i did, i realized i could have it all. i can kill in broad daylight. and nobody's gonna tell the police they were fucked by a ghost. anything i desire i can make happen, but not if people know.}
<A>__{linda and matt have reached the door of the lab. she pushes through it and slams it behind her.}
