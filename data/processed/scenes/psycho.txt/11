<L>__{interior mary's bedroom (day)}
<A>__{a double bed in the foreground. we just see the far side as the camera shoots across. mary enters the scene, clad only in her slip. perhaps she is about to get into bed. behind her is an open closet, but too dark inside for us to see any contents. as mary turns to the closet the camera lowers to show a close view of the $40,000 in the envelope on our side of the bed. mary takes a dress from the closet and starts to put it on as the camera retreats to reveal a packed but not yet closed suitcase also on the bed. mary zips up her dress and then brings some final garments from the closet. she comes around to the suitcase and puts them on the top. mary works with haste and in tension, as if acting on an impulse which might vanish as quickly as it came. the suitcase filled now, she checks around the room, then takes her handbag to the bed, puts in the money filled envelope, and then slams the suitcase shut. then filled she looks at her small bedroom desk, goes to it, removes a small file envelope from one of the drawers. it is one of those brown envelopes in which one keeps important papers and policies and certificates. she checks its contents briefly, puts it on the bed, opens another desk drawer, takes out her bank book, tosses it on the bed. then she packs both the file envelope and the bank book, into her handbag, takes one quick last look around the room, picks up the handbag and the suitcase and goes out of the room.}
