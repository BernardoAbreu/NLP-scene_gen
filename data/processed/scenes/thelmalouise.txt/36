<A>__{she hangs up and goes into the bathroom. as the door closes behind her, louise comes up with a handful of change and starts putting it into the phone. she dials a number. it rings for a long time. she hangs up and goes into the bathroom. she looks at herself in the mirror. she notices a tiny speck on her cheek. she takes a paper towel and wets it and rubs the spot. she looks at the towel and there is a bright red streak.}
