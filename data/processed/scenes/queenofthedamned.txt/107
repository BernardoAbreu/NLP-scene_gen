<L>__{exterior maharet's desert mansion day}
<A>__{maharet's sprawling compound sits alone in the empty desert. nothing for as far as the eye can see.}
<C>__{jesse }
<D>__{lestat is my destiny... i know that now. i love you, aunt maharet. good bye.}
<A>__{jesse walks away from the house. coming to a highway, she reads a sign "death valley 120 miles." just then, a vw minibus barrels down the road in jesse's direction. she sticks out her thumb... the minibus pulls to a stop on the shoulder in a cloud of dust. a vampire driver leans out the window not a real vampire, just a kid with white face paint and fake fangs.}
<C>__{vampire driver}
<D>__{need a ride?}
<A>__{jesse peers past the driver to a crowd of goths and fake vampires. the vampire lestat blares from the speakers.}
<C>__{jesse}
