<L>__{interior back hallways day}
<A>__{the children are now far from the other tourists and their class. larry is frightened. the hall takes a sharp dog leg, ending in a darkened cul de sac full of display cases filled with hideous carved masks. against the side of the chamber is a barricade of wood which looks much like a wall. henry tugs at it and the barricade moves. he looks behind.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{hey, there's a secret staircase back here. cool.}
<A>__{henry disappears behind the barricade leaving larry completely alone in the dark room with the shaman masks.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{henry, come back!}
<A>__{henry doesn't respond. the lights in the cases throw strange shadows. larry starts to sniffle, falls to hiccuping, sits down. he pulls on a little flap of rubber that's coming off the toe of his sneaker, all bravado gone.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{henry! henry!}
<A>__{no answer. larry rises and peeks behind the barricade. he sees the circular stair. it descends into total darkness. from below comes a strange smell that makes larry's nose wrinkle.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{henry?}
<A>__{no answer. larry puts his first foot on the stair.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{henry! come up! please!}
<A>__{with no other option but staying alone in the dark, larry follows henry down.}
