<A>__{krod, i beem, boole, quantz and code monkeys cheer. mega embraces rush. energy sizzles between them.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{i underestimated you. thanks.}
<A>__{she presses her lips to his. it's electric.}
<C>__{krod}
<P>__{(to i beem)}
<D>__{you knew she always liked him.}
<C>__{code monk b3t}
<D>__{is she pinging his eprom?}
<C>__{code monk j2r}
<D>__{i can't see from here.}
<A>__{but out of triumph, a sudden concern rush's body shoots data energy into mega, into ground circuits... lightshow overload intensifies and spreads. mega backs away in pain.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{whoa, ouch, what? ahhhhh!}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{rush, what is it?}
<A>__{rush's body drains away into the energized circuitry.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{guys! mega! nooo!}
<A>__{he reaches a hand to mega. pain energy zaps her, but she clasps his hand anyway...}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{help him!}
<A>__{code monkeys attempt desperate measures, but soon it's over. bits of rush dissipate into surrounding circuitry, then beam skyward in blazing curtain, like a quantum aurora borealis. mega is left with a handful of nothing.}
<C>__{quantz}
<D>__{it's the way it should be.}
<C>__{boole}
<D>__{he's going back to the place he belongs.}
