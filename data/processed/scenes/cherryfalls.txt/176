<A>__{the newspaper headlines from 1970 pass by. jody is watching them flash by. she slows down, then goes back. she's found what she's looking for. a picture of lisa sherman. it's her yearbook picture. she looks eerily identical to the picture that jody drew. the headline reads 'high school senior attacked in park'. jody hears footsteps coming up the stairs. she looks up. the footsteps stop. the old library is still. she senses that someone is watching her.}

<D>__{who's there?}
