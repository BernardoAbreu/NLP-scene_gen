<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{it's like some guy trying to sell me life insurance. you think i'm gonna take some money out of my pocket to give to some jerk so that somebody can take it when i'm dead? no, sam, you gotta live for today. i'm gonna live as good as i can every day. you know what i'm saying?}
<A>__{as sam and tilley walk towards tilley's cadillac, bb and moe are walking to bb's cadillac parked close to tilley's car. they see each other.}

<P>__{(yelling to bb)}
<D>__{hey, mr. marengay went to the track!}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{did you bother to bet, or did you just hand your money to the tellers?}

<C>__{bb}
<D>__{you want me to believe that you were setting me up with your wife as some kind of decoy?}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{decoy is the word!}
<A>__{there's a long beat as the two guys eye one another. then, almost in a soft apologetic manner, bb speaks.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{okay then, you win.}
<A>__{bb gets into his car.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{i win?}
<P>__{(to sam)}
