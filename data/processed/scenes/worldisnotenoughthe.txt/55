<L>__{interior briefing room, castle thane (mi 6 hq) later}
<A>__{a huge chandelier dominates the vast stone room. several agents listen to the debriefing. robinson and m watch tanner explain things; he holds a fifty pound note and king's lapel pin (now blackened, fused, melted to expose electronics beneath).}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{...the money was dipped in urea, dried, and packed tight. in one note the metal strip had been replaced with a combustible magnesium circuit in effect a tiny detonator. king always wore a pin in his lapel, an heirloom called 'the eye of the glens'; but someone switched it for a copy, a ceramic micro circuit emitting an electronic signature.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{on bond as he enters the room. he hangs back in the shadows, watches tanner mime the pin moving to the note:}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{when he came within range of the money boom. ingenious.}
<A>__{m steps forward. her fury controlled.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{we've been pawns in someone's game. they tricked us into bringing the money to king. not just elaborate. cock sure.}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{and expensive. cost three million plus.}
<A>__{suddenly the chandelier darkens, the floor brightens into a vast screen, showing a satellite image of central asia and the mediterranean. m and robinson walk onto the screen.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{cheap, if it achieves your aim of de stabilizing the western world.}
<A>__{she causes the desired stir. bond steps forward from the shadows to get a better view. m sees the sling has gone.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{007. what do you know of the caspian sea?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{caviar capital of the world. matchless beluga. firm, yet subtle.}
<P>__{(m looks askance)}
<D>__{largest landlocked body of water on earth. oil rich. hitler wanted it. stalin beat him to it.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{and now it's up for grabs, a goldrush. far more oil than anyone thought.}
<C>__{robinson}
<D>__{latest estimates, six trillion dollars. it'll make the gulf look like a puddle, see us right through the new century. the problem is getting the oil out of there.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{there are four pipelines in the works. three to the black sea, shipping out through the bosphorus. all vulnerable to unstable governments or russian blockade.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{so sir robert's goes through turkey, direct to the med...?}
<C>__{robinson}
<D>__{a huge project. the most expensive of the pipelines, but the one supported by every western leader. none of the american oil companies were willing to take it on. but king has connections to the region. he married into the vavra family, rich local industrialists. he used those connections to hold it all together.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{kill the man, kill the pipeline.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{not necessarily. not with elektra taking over.}
<A>__{tanner notices a red light start pulsing. he moves to m:}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{your call to the pm.}
<A>__{m nods grimly. as robinson distributes sealed envelopes:}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{our credibility has been hit hard. we have to hit back harder. your assignments.}
<A>__{they open their envelopes, but bond received nothing.}
<C>__{m}
<P>__{(to bond)}
<D>__{i'm waiting for the report on your medical.}
<A>__{she leaves. bond is brooding.}
