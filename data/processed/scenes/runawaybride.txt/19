<A>__{no, you tell her.}
<C>__{mrs. pressman}
<A>__{no, no. you're her best friend.}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{no.}
<C>__{mrs. pressman}
<P>__{(holding her newspaper)}
<A>__{you know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{yeah.}
<C>__{mrs. pressman}
<A>__{maybe she hasn't read the paper... on the counter, they see a copy of usa today opened to the article about maggie.}
<C>__{mrs. pressman }
<A>__{... or not! we follow maggie down the back stairs inside the hale hardware store, the prettiest, most welcoming shop of its kind anywhere in small town usa. somehow the place ha taken on the spirit of the owner's daughter; both stop and shop girl radiate brightness, charm, and possibility. maggie comes down steps with a faucet handle and goes to an elderly customer, mr. paxton.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(bright)}
<A>__{here we go! one antique hot water handle with the "hot" still on it, guaranteed to fit any american standard cast iron tub with a four inch center made between 1924 and 1938. in other words, i think you're out of the doghouse with mrs. paxton.}
<C>__{mr. paxton}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<A>__{hallelujah.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{alright, mr. paxton, i will put it on your account. maggie rounds the bend, another customer, earl, stands by the paint machine.}
<C>__{earl}
<A>__{maggie.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(walking past customer)}
<A>__{you don't need an air conditioner, earl, you just need an attic fan there's more in the back. maggie steps behind the front counter of the store and takes the account book out. her voice trails off as she sees the dour expression on the faces of her friends.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{what? peggy nervously mentions the newspaper.}
<C>__{peggy}
<P>__{(delicate)}
<A>__{so mag you've seen this, huh?}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(serious)}
<A>__{yes, i've seen it. and i have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me! to their amazement, maggie starts smiling.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{you guys! how long did this take you? maggie stays amused.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{where'd you get this done?}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<A>__{you creeps! i should disinvite you! and why did you say seven times? this is four.}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{uh, maggie, you told us to bachelorette jokes, so we didn't... maggie looks at the stricken face of her friends.}
<C>__{mrs. pressman}
<A>__{holy moly. peggy looks like she is going to cry with sympathy for maggie. maggie is starting to feel uncomfortable. she looks down, dubiously, at the paper.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{um, you know, now would be a good moment to tell me this is fake.}
<P>__{(no response)}
<A>__{it won't be funny if you drag it out. okay?}
<P>__{(no response)}
<A>__{okay, well... i mean, i can find out... real newspapers smear. phoney papers don't. she picks up the paper and brushes it against her apron, leaving an ink smear!! she nearly kneels over.}
<C>__{maggie }
<P>__{(sitting)}
<A>__{bag. peggy and mrs. pressman immediately spring to her side. they give her a bag to breathe in.}
<C>__{mrs. pressman}
<A>__{bag.}
