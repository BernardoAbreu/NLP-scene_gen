<A>__{mike moves deeper into the woods. he's a mix of paranoia and determination. mike pauses, catching his breath, when... a few blood drops of blood land on his face. mike wipes his face, looks at the blood. what the fuck? a couple more drops hit him. mike looks up... a mangled, mutilated deer hangs in the trees, secured by coarse thick ropes. mike takes a terrified step backwards, unaware... a few feet behind him lays a rusted, steel bear trap. mike, still mesmerized by the blood and the deer, continues backing up... getting closer to the bear trap... closer... his foot hovers over the center of the trap... snap! crunch! mike steps in the trap, the jaws chomp down on his leg! mike screams in agony! he drops to the ground, stares at his leg, now a bloody mess of flesh and steel.}

<A>__{mike writhes in pain on the ground. his eyes watering. the pain unbearable. then... mike's pov someone or thing appears, stepping from the forest. they come closer. the sun blasts directly behind the figure keeping their identity hidden. mike's eyelids flutter, can't determine who what it is. the pain overwhelms him. he doesn't care any longer. then... ida bends down next to mike.}
