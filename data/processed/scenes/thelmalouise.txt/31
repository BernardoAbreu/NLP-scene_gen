<C>__{louise}
<D>__{we gotta be inconspicuous. do you know what that means?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{it means you don't talk to anybody. you don't draw attention to yourself in any way. do you understand that?}
<A>__{again, she twitches more than nods.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{tell me you understand that.}
<A>__{thelma nods more firmly now. she understands. various pov shots of truck drivers seeing thelma and louise wind their way towards the restaurant portion of the coffee shop. they look small and incongruous with the surroundings.}
