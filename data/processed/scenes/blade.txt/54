<A>__{tanaka spins around, startled, tries to throw a punch blade traps tanaka's arm, levering the man up and over. he crashes into a shelving unit, taking the whole thing down with him. karen winces. blade grabs a handful of tanaka's hair, yanks his head up }

<A>__{blade drops tanaka, moves to the bookcase. he searches the wall a moment, then finds a trigger. hits it the bookcase slides aside, revealing a hidden elevator. as blade moves to put his sunglasses back on blade's pov (in the reflection of his sunglasses) we see tanaka behind him, pulling a handgun out of a desk drawer, swinging it up blade unholsters one of his casulls faster than any gunslinger in history. he fires over his own shoulder, blowing tanaka back against the wall. blade puts his sunglasses back on, motions to the elevator, then nods to karen }
