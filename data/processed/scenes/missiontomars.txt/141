<L>__{exterior mars. the face. late day}
<A>__{from the radar gun on ares 8's back, a sharp, high pitched electronic burst is emitted, pulsating like a tuning fork as it's fired towards the face. after a few seconds it stops. for a moment nothing happens. then the deep bass rumbling stops as well. the only remaining sound is of wind, stirring up dust on the martian plains.}
<B>__{angle on the face}
<A>__{as suddenly a huge, curved segment of the white surface begins to rise from the earth, like a gigantic hangar door, sliding out of sight into an upper sheath of some kind. the movement is measured, stately, utterly silent. as the segment rises, it reveals a blinding white light: the interior of the face. no inside details can be seen.}
