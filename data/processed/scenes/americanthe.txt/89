<L>__{interior jack's room night}
<A>__{jack is asleep. he is not alone. in the bed beside him:}
<C>__{ingrid.}
<A>__{pale as death. eyes rolled back in her sockets.}
<D>__{}
<A>__{jack wakes up suddenly, gasping. the bed is empty, the sheets twisted and damp.}
<L>__{exterior castel del monte dawn}
<B>__{sunrise...}
<A>__{...over one of the most desolate and beautiful landscapes in all italy.}
<L>__{interior jack's room dawn}
<A>__{in the gun metal light of dawn, fiddly work:}
<D>__{ cartridges taken apart tiny holes drilled in the nose to a depth of precisely 3mm the hole half filled with mercury and plugged with a drop of liquid lead.}
<A>__{jack is converting jacketed ammunition into explosive}
<B>__{bullets.}
<L>__{interior church day}
<A>__{outside, the sun is merciless. inside, jack has taken refuge in the cool of the church. he is alone. he is not praying. just staring impassively at the gaudy crucifixion: at the thorns and the nails and the running blood. footsteps. jack checks for reflections in his watch. it's father benedetto: dressed for mass.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{i've been looking for you.}
<A>__{he mops the sweat from his brow with the hem of his soutane, takes jack by the arm and leads him to one side, away from the light of the candles.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{a man was here asking questions about you.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{here?}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{he came to the church this afternoon.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what did he want?}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{to know where you live. he said he was a friend from switzerland.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{switzerland?}
<A>__{jack thinks.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{and you told him?}
<A>__{the priest looks at with complete disdain:}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{of course i do not tell him. how do i know him? he is maybe the police. certainly he is no friend. a friend would know your pensione. besides...}
<A>__{father benedetto leans close and whispers:}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{friends do not carry guns.}
<A>__{father benedetto glances shrewdly at jack, his eyes searching into him.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{if you live in italy, and you are a man of the cloth, you meet many people. besides, i lived once in naples. if you live in naples you know the difference between a fat wallet and a... custodia per armi di spalla. how you say in english?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{shoulder holster.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{si.}
<A>__{jack glances up and down the aisle. old ladies are dribbling into church in twos and threes. the bell for mass starts ringing.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're a true friend, father.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{i am a priest.}
<A>__{jack turns to go.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{signor clarke?}
<A>__{again the priest leans close, holding jack by the elbow in a gesture of austere confidence.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{i make a mistake. he did not say he was from la svizzera: switzerland. he said forgive me the names in italian are so similar la svezia: sweden.}
