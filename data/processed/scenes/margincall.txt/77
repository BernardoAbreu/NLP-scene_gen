<A>__{there is a very quiet energy on the floor. a low murmur. then a hush falls over the floor as people pass on the info that the ceo, john tuld is about to come onto the floor. he appears at one end of the floor and it falls silent. john walks dramatically into the middle of the floor and then into the middle of the row in the dead middle of the floor. he looks around and stands in letting the drama build. then he climbs up onto the desk and looks out onto the floor like a general.}

<D>__{by the end of today almost everyone else in the world, including me, will have considerably less money than they began the day with..... you, in this room, are the exception. you will leave here today richer. you will fire the first shot, i wish it didn't have to be, but at times the market must eat its weak, and you all... are not the weak. we must strike quick, with no doubt, if you hear pause on the line, attack. by noon the sec is going to be in here getting in your faces, sniffing around, you let us take care of them and you just keep going. we own what we are choosing to sell today and there is nothing they can do about it. 107 years ago this firm was founded, today we secure our place for next 107. you've got two minutes before we get started. let's finish this, so we can get on to the next one...}
