<L>__{int luxury b&b dining room evening}
<A>__{full of couples in love. young couples, old couples, gay couples, straight couples. even a dog couple snuggled up by the fire. and then there's milo and cass, bruised and dishevelled, being served an elaborate romantic meal. they smile uncomfortably as edmund arrives with a tray of oysters:}
<C>__{edmund}
<D>__{to begin: a little aphrodisiac!}
<A>__{he gives them both a broad wink.}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{wow.}
<C>__{cass}
<P>__{(same)}
<D>__{great.}
<C>__{edmund}
<D>__{so tell me: how have you managed to keep the romance alive all this time?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{well, i will tell you, edmund. the secret to our success is that the little woman here knows her place. she cleans for me, cooks for me, and every night when i come home she gets down on her knees and massages my feet.}
<A>__{he beams at cass. cass grins through her teeth.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{yes, edmund, it's true. i massage his feet to help him feel like a man. it's important, especially when your husband has such a teeny tiny...}
<A>__{just then, dawn hustles over, interrupting:}
<C>__{dawn}
<D>__{how is everything? is it like that magical night 3 years ago?}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{yup. you betcha.}
<C>__{dawn}
<D>__{this calls for a toast!}
<A>__{she raises a glass, tapping it with a spoon. milo and cass both groan under their breath.}
<C>__{dawn}
<P>__{(to the room)}
<D>__{may i have your attention please? edmund and i would like to share with you the most romantic moment we have ever seen. it was three years ago today, in this very restaurant, when this lovely young man here, right in the middle of the meal, threw down his napkin, got down on one knee, and said marry me, right now, right this second, i want to go to sleep tonight knowing you're my wife!}
<C>__{edmund}
<P>__{(jumping in)}
<D>__{and she said yes, with tears in her eyes and a tremble in her hand, let's get married, and they ran out to the all night chapel and came back an hour later, man and wife!}
<A>__{the whole restaurant starts clapping. milo turns to edmund:}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{can i get a whiskey?}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{make that two.}
