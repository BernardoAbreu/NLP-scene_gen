<L>__{exterior battlements, camelot dusk}
<A>__{arthur and merlin, the king desperate, the wizard overwhelmed by compassion:}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i am alone and betrayed. by my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. and by you. perhaps most of all by you. for you made me, you forged this wretched life. and like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{that is my destiny. i have a destiny, too...}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{with all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{my powers fade, arthur. i resort to cheap tricks...}
<P>__{(with sudden enthusiasm)}
<D>__{yes! i enjoy every moment of my foolishness, i join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. but you! you betray yourself.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{me? i have lived by the oath of king and knight.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{you betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the dragon... the dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the king to be a king...}
<A>__{arthur looks up and in the rolling clouds maybe, just maybe, the form of a dragon is taking shape. arthur draws excalibur, intensity animating his dead features.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i must do it myself. i must kill them both. lancelot and guenevere. will you ride with me, merlin?}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{i cannot. i must not. here i must stay.}
<A>__{they embrace. merlin is on the verge of tears, his face immediately sad and finally ancient. arthur exits. morgana, who has been watching from the shadows, watching from the shadows, slinks up to merlin's side.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{crazy old fool. you think yourself a kingmaker. ha! a meddler, more likely. look what a mess you've made of things.}
<A>__{merlin smiles knowingly at her.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{i? perhaps, perhaps. i'm losing interest, morgana... i have helped men or meddled in their affairs, if you would have it that way since the dawn of time. now let them live by their own laws. let them stand on their own feet. the gods of once are gone forever, it is time for men... morgana, make a man out of me. kiss me.}
<A>__{he reaches to touch her lips. she cradles his hand in hers and doesn't allow merlin to kiss her. she kisses his knuckles and stares into his eyes, stoking his desire.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{you know what i want. i want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{that i cannot.}
<A>__{she breaks away, provocative, alluring.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{then i will not.}
