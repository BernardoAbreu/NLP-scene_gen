<C>__{marianne }
<D>__{ok. well, this is me.}
<A>__{brandon nods, hovers by the subway, awkward and yet }
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{this is you.}

<A>__{they loiter on the edge of something more.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{right.}
<B>__{silence}
<A>__{brandon hovers, momentarily fragile, the sting of uncertainty. marianne descends into the depths of the subway, with a half wave.}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{so, is that a yes?}
<C>__{marianne }
<D>__{maybe, yeah.}
