<L>__{interior mother superior's office later that day}
<A>__{mother superior is seated behind her desk; she is very angry. christy sits across from her.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{a balloon and a banana! tell me, mary clarence, what were you thinking?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{those girls were asking questions. they've got it rough. i wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age. i wish somebody would talk to me about it now.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{this is a convent, not a clinic. we offer moral guidance, not hardware.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{have you been out in those streets? do you know what those kids are up against? you should help them!}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{we are nuns. we seek solutions through prayer.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{sometimes it's not enough!}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{you are correct. sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation. such as your own, for example. how do you feel about physical labor?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{it never solves anything.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{do your recall the words of saint peter, in ecciesiastes 1:27? he spoke unto a wastrel youth. he said, "take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."}

<A>__{mother superior smiles in a rather evil manner.}
