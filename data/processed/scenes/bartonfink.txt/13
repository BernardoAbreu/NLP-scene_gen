<L>__{1:30.}
<B>__{the hallway}
<A>__{at the end of the dimly lit corridor a red light blinks on over the elevator, with a faint bell.}
<B>__{back to barton}
<A>__{with two violent and simultaneous motions he whips the pillow off his head and throws out his other wrist to look at his watch. there is a knock at the door. barton swings his feet off the bed.}
<B>__{the doorway}
<A>__{barton opens the door to audrey.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{hello, barton.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{audrey, thank you for coming. thank you. i'm sorry to be such a... such a... thank you.}
<A>__{they enter the main room, where audrey perches on the edge of the bed.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{now that's all right, barton. everything'll be all right.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{yes. thank you. how's bill?}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{oh, he's... he drifted off. he'll sleep for a while now. what is it you have to do, exactly?}
<A>__{barton paces.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{well i have to come up with an outline, i'd guess you call it. the story. the whole goddamn story. soup to nuts. three acts. the whole goddamn }
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{it's alright, barton. you don't have to write actual scenes?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{no, but the whole goddamn audrey? have you ever had to read any of bill's wrestling scenarios?}
<A>__{audrey laughs.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{yes, i'm afraid i have.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{what are they like? what are they about?}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. there's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. in between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect. bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. and sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild. the studio always hated that. oh, some of the scripts were so... spirited!}
<A>__{she laughs then stops, realizing that she has laughed. she looks at barton.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{...barton.}
<A>__{she shakes her head.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{...look, it's really just a formula. you don't have to type your soul into it. we'll invent some names and a new setting. i will help you and it won't take any time at all. i did it for bill so many times}
<A>__{barton's pacing comes up short.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{did what for bill?}
<A>__{guardedly:}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{well... this.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{you wrote his scripts for him?}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{well, the basic ideas were frequently his }
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{you wrote bill's scripts! jesus christ, you wrote his what about before that?}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{before what?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{before bill came to hollywood.}
<A>__{audrey is clearly reluctant to travel this path.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{well, bill was always the author, so to speak }
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{what do you mean so to speak?! audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{barton, i think we should concentrate on our little project }
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{i want to know how many of bill's books you wrote!}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{barton!}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{i want to know!}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{barton, honestly, only the last couple }
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{hah!}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{and my input was mostly... editorial, really, when he'd been drinking }
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{i will bet. jesus "the grand productive days." what a goddamn phony.}
<A>__{he resumes pacing.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{...w.p. mayhew. william goddamn phony mayhew. all his guff about escape. hah! i will say he escaped!}
<A>__{barton sighs and looks at his watch.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{...well, we don't have much time.}
<A>__{he sits down next to audrey. audrey's tone is gentle.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{it'll be fine... don't judge him, barton. don't condescend to him...}
<A>__{she strokes barton's hair.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{...it's not as simple as you think. i helped bill most by appreciating him, by understanding him. we all need understanding, barton. even you, tonight, it's all you really need...}
<A>__{she kisses him. as barton tentatively responds, we are panning away. we frame up on the door to the bathroom and track in toward the sink. we can hear the creak of bedsprings and audrey and barton's breath, becoming labored. the continuing track brings us up to and over the lid of the sink to frame up its drain, a perfect black circle in the porcelain white. we track up to the drain and are enveloped by it as the sound of lovemaking mixes into the groaning of pipes.}
