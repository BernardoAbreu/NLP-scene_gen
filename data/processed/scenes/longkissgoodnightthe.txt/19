<D>__{tomato.}
<A>__{who catches it, plops it on the cutting board and proceeds to dice it to simthereens. razor thin slices. knife a blur. missing her fingers by millimeters, never faltering, like a mad mumblety pegger }

<A>__{and now it's a food fight, pelting mom, and the floor is covered with food as hal stumbles in laughing, scoops up caitlin samantha shakes her head, grinning, dices to pieces a last, lovely radish. ends with a flourish, ta dah ! doesn't think: flips the knife point up on one finger. tips it for balance. lobs a tomato. slings the knife without looking, pins it to the wall, ka chuk ! everyone goes silent. the knife, quivering. caitlin and hal turn as one, gaping at her. she shrugs numbly. blinks.}
