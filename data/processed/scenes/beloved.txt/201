<D>__{..i swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. she played with me and always came to be with me whenever i needed her. me and her waited for our daddy. i love her. i do. she never hurt me. i love my mother but i know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, i'm scared of her because of it. all the time, i'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. so i never leave this house and i watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... i have to keep it away from my sister...i will protect beloved...'cause she's mine...}
