<L>__{interior dance studio day}
<A>__{sara. alone. she pushes the tape from patrick into an ancient recorder. the music comes on. she takes to the floor. her face is like a pinched nerve. she wants to cry. she tries to dance.}
<L>__{interior sara's room night}
<A>__{sara's on the futon, flipping through a photo album. pictures of her and glynn. roy knocks on the partition. waits a beat before he comes in. he looks at sara. she keeps flipping.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i was wondering... how long you plan on hating me? maybe i'm an optimist but i hope there's some kind of timetable.}
<P>__{(this raises a small smile)}
<D>__{well, i don't wanna bug you. i just came in to say good luck.}
<A>__{sara regards him quizzically. roy goes to her dresser, picks up an envelope from juilliard.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i saw the return address. got curious. it was open. i read it. i know i shouldn't have but at least now i have an excuse to tell you how proud i am of you, sara.}
<C>__{sara}
<P>__{(quietly miserable)}
<D>__{i was gonna tell you about the audition, roy. i meant to.}
<A>__{she's clutching the photo album. roy sits down next to her.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{tomorrow's the big day?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{uh huh. the big day.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{you bummed out about it?}
<P>__{(as she shakes her head)}
<D>__{you're a worse liar than i am father.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{you're not so bad.}
<P>__{(close to a confession)}
<D>__{i didn't give you much to work with. it's not like i've been the perfect daughter.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{well, it ain't like i deserve a perfect daughter. i screwed up. did everything in a hurry and still thought i had all the time in the world. to be in love with your mother. be a father to you. but time flies. you look up one day and all you got to show for yourself is a pretty little girl who hates your guts and won't talk to you because too much time went by.}
<A>__{sara's eyes well up. before she can stop herself, she's crying.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i don't hate you. i miss her. i miss mom...}
<P>__{(as roy takes her}
<D>__{in his arms, tries}
<P>__{to console her)}
<D>__{... patrick's pissed at me. i'm pissed at him. he's not coming tomorrow and i want him there and i don't know what to do.}
<A>__{sara draws back from roy, wipes her tears. collects herself.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{you want him there. i understand that. but whatever he brings to the table, patrick can't dance for you, sara. you're the bottom line out there. this is your chance to be the dancer juilliard came to see.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i wanted somebody there who loves me.}
<A>__{roy regards her softly, significantly, the irony implicit.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{sara looks up. for the first time in her life, she believes him.}
