<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you'd never know it.}
<A>__{he motions to a high tech orb, showing footage of vdi's accomplishments: a safe and clean nuclear facility, the first private space station. all images have victor front and center, glad handling george bush, tony blair, shady international leaders. the last image is victor holding the america's cup.}

<A>__{a large, dark office. ben in the corner. he yawns, watches... bright holograms: stars. planets. they hover in the air, making the room feel like a majestic portal into outer space.}
<C>__{reed }
<D>__{my research suggests that exposure to a high energy cosmic storm born on solar winds might have triggered the evolution of early planetary life.}
<A>__{reed stands among the holograms, speaking to a mysterious figure in shadow behind a desk. an ominous, pulsating red cloud covers the stars. it washes over a hologram of earth.}
<C>__{reed }
<D>__{in six weeks another cloud with the same elemental profile will pass earth's orbit. a study in space could advance our knowledge about the structure of the human genome, and help cure countless diseases, extend human life }

<C>__{victor}
<D>__{but dreams don't pay the bills, do they?}
<P>__{(a condescending smile)}
<D>__{same old reed, the hopeless optimist. still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{you remember in school we talked about working together. that's what i was about to explain...}
<A>__{reed presses the remote. another hologram appears: a shuttle slowly approaching an orbiting space station. both bear the von doom industries logo. victor smiles, more intrigued.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{so it's not my money you want. it's my toys... tell me: if nasa doesn't trust you, why should i?}
<A>__{victor is a step ahead. reed pauses, thrown for a beat. ben wakes up, suspicious. victor notices. he notices everything.}

<D>__{that's my job. to stay a step ahead. to know what other men don't.}

<D>__{ben, it's been too long.}

<C>__{sue}
<D>__{never better.}

<D>__{not at all.}

<D>__{good. then you're just in time to hear the great reed richards ask me for help.}
<P>__{(to reed)}
<D>__{you know, you made a lot of folks at mit feel like a junior high science fair. so you'll excuse me if i savor the moment.}

<C>__{reed}
<D>__{you back this mission, and i will sign over a fair percentage of any applications or }

<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{ben, the money's not important. we could save lives.}
<A>__{sue gives a thin smile a flicker of old feelings.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{twenty five percent of a billion is enough to keep the lights on, isn't it? maybe even pay off your fourth mortgage on the baxter building.}

<A>__{reed and ben step into the elevator.}

<C>__{reed}
<D>__{ben, think about all the people we can help if this works }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{maybe you should think about yourself for once. you always let this guy push you round }

<D>__{those solar winds are flaring, but i factored them into my coordinates and }
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{i was talking about us. working together.}
<A>__{sue holds her eyes on reed. he is clearly uncomfortable in her gaze. did the elevator just get smaller?}
<C>__{reed}
<P>__{(thinking, talking fast)}
<D>__{well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and i will focus on the molecular physics. or, uhm, maybe i should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho }
<C>__{sue}
<P>__{(droll, a little annoyed)}
<D>__{right. that's exactly what i meant.}
<A>__{she shakes her head same old reed. he looks at her what did he say wrong? ben smiles, patting reed on the shoulder.}

<D>__{way to not overthink it.}
<P>__{(to sue)}
<D>__{so when do we leave?}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{i will schedule the launch. call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.}
<A>__{she offers a business card. reed doesn't take it.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{i, uh, think i remember the number.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{it's been changed.}
<A>__{beat. ben grimaces. reed takes the card, his eyes down.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{as far as crew, i was hoping ben could pilot the mission }
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. you remember my brother johnny...}
<A>__{off ben's curdling smile, we dissolve to : }
<L>__{exterior lake launch facility day}
<A>__{a helicopter shot through trees. we soar over timberland, and find something massive looming on the horizon: a spacecraft. a sleek take on a space shuttle. modern tech combined with industrial design that nasa could never afford. the craft's nose is pointed straight up, ready for launch. workers in jumpsuits are scattered around the two hundred foot tall scaffolding, performing routine checks.}
<L>__{exterior gantry overlook day}
<A>__{ben stares up at the craft. a sneer on his face.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{can't do it. i cannot do it.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{external srbs, orbital system engines. its just like the shuttles you flew in }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no. i cannot take orders from that underwear model. that wingnut washed out of nasa for sneaking two victoria secret wannabes into a flight simulator.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{youthful high spirits.}
<A>__{they walk toward the base of the scaffolding.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{they crashed it into a wall. a flight simulator.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{i'm sure he's matured since then.}
<A>__{close on johnny storm, leaning over to kiss a hot redhead. pull back to reveal he's riding a motorcycle, and she's driving a red corvette with license plate: frankie. pick up reed and ben, watching through binoculars.}
<C>__{reed }
<D>__{when have i asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?}
<C>__{ben}

<A>__{ben goes to attention on reflex: johnny snaps a picture with a digital camera. then advances, as ben realizes who it is...}
<C>__{johnny }
<D>__{digital camera: $254. memory stick: $59. the look on your hard ass former co's grill when he finds out he's your junior officer: priceless.}
<A>__{ben eyeballs johnny, suddenly reaches up as if to grab him. johnny flinches. but ben just reaches for johnny's zipper, adjusts his uniform.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i can handle the ship. i can even handle mr. blonde ambition. but i don't know if i should be flying or playing vegas in these suits. who the hell came up with them?}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{victor did.}

<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{harry winston sends his regards.}

<C>__{reed}
<D>__{he's made a few changes.}

<C>__{reed}
<D>__{victor's better at these things.}
<A>__{just past the press area, they see...one woman standing, waiting. this is debbie, ben's fiancee. and for the first time in the entire film...ben smiles. they hug, kissing. johnny and reed watch. reed glances at sue, who walks ahead. debbie slips a photo into ben's flightsuit. a tender beat.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i will be watching over you.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{just get back soon, or i start looking for a new groom.}

<D>__{actually, the engines are smes. hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. couple generations past your last ride.}

<D>__{i'm not as dumb as you look.}
<A>__{ben just glares at reed. this is going to be a long trip. as they follow after sue, we cut back to : }
<B>__{victor on stage}
<A>__{mid speech. playing behind him is reed's hologram: stars give way to a pulsating red cloud...}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{think of a world without genetic flaws no asthma, allergies, baldness, breast cancer...}
<A>__{ben and reed hear the speech. ben bristles.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what's wrong with being bald...?}

<A>__{on those words, the hologram transforms to...von doom's shuttle on the launch pad. boom! thrusters fire white hot. smoke billows across the pad. ready for take off. victor walks past the hologram and exits. his departure perfectly timed with the shuttle lifting off. we push in on the shuttle, and follow the ship as it leaves earth's atmosphere. boom booster rockets fall away and the shuttle fires its thrusters. the hologram transitions to... a shot of the space station high above the earth. the shuttle enters from the top, lighting up the hologram with engines afire. as the shuttle approaches the station we cut to }
