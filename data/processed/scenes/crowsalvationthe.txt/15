<L>__{interior garrison prison alex's cell night}
<A>__{alex still gazing at the picture of lauren. at the board, walsh moves a piece.}
<C>__{mercer}
<D>__{i was facing the hot seat, i'd want my attorney banging down the door of the supreme court, not playing board games. but maybe that's just me.}
<A>__{they look up as mercer appears outside the barred door to the cell, starts to unlock it.}
<C>__{walsh}
<D>__{your move.}
<C>__{mercer}
<D>__{no. it's time.}
<A>__{it really is. other prison personnel arrive outside the cell in various uniforms: a minister with clerical collar, the warden, two guards. waiting. walsh crosses, very emotional how. gives alex a huge hug.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i don't want you to watch. i don't want to give them the pleasure.}
<A>__{the two friends exchange a long last look.}
<C>__{mercer}
<D>__{ok. c'mon now...}
<A>__{as alex exits past mercer, walsh sits down on the cot. he's hard to read a second until he lashes out, flips... the cake against the wall where it hits, slides down, still semi intact as it hits the floor.}
