<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{a blue field with a pulsing network of rippling lines. voom! a figure rockets down into frame in a curtain of bubbles. a gawky agent, in less than stylish fbi trunks, flails around blindfolded looking for bricks at the bottom of a pool.}
<L>__{interior gymnasium pool day}
<A>__{the pool casts wavy distortions upon two dozen men, all grumbling as they stand in line, wearing t shirts with fbi logos, sweats and sneakers. we hear a splash, and the men shuffle forward.}
<C>__{pappas }
<D>__{the dolls love this baby. it brings them luck when they rub it right between their buttons.}
<A>__{close on tape measure wrapped around a generous belly. pull back to reveal veteran agent corey measuring the ample waist of angelo pappas. this 54 year old silver haired greek stands rubbing his belly like a zulu chief.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{angelo, we need a bigger tape.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{just read the goddamn number.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{still a 46. maybe we can cinch it down, wear a girdle }
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{screw you and this holistic fitness crap! at least my arms don't flap in the wind.}
<A>__{corey secretly squeezes his bicep as... a whistle blows. a broad shouldered man wearing an fbi cap barks at the greek.}
<C>__{big shoulders}
<D>__{okay, pappas, let's put on the blindfold. wanna see you retrieve at least two bricks from the bottom.}
<A>__{johnny utah enters the pool area in the distance. says something to one of the agents. is pointed toward us as corey ties the blindfold and guides pappas to the edge of the pool.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{i've been in the field 33 years, fired my piece 23 times in the line of duty, and i got no idea what a blind man fetching bricks has gotta do with being a special agent!}
<A>__{johnny has walked up. pappas, blindfolded, turns directly to utah as he continues, thinking it's corey.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{added to which indignity, i got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue flamer fresh out of quantico for a partner. some quarterback punk, johnny unitas or something.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{the shit they pull, huh?}
<A>__{pappas snorts agreement and cannonballs into the pool. huge backblast of water. the other agents hoot and holler. corey swears and wipes off his clipboard. johnny steps to the edge, looks down. we see the blindfolded pappas groveling along the bottom. the other agents cheer as pappas heads for the surface.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{here he comes. hold up a fish, he'll take it right outta your hand.}
<A>__{pappas surfaces in an explosion of spray as he sputters for breath. he grabs the edge and angrily slaps two bricks on the tiles. he rips off the blindfold looks up and frowns. a hand enters frame to help him up. pappas takes it and johnny hauls him on deck.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{hey shamu, this is your guy.}
<A>__{pappas eyes the new agent warily. extends his hand.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{pappas. angelo pappas.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{punk. quarterback punk.}
<C>__{pappas}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{welcome to sea world, kid.}
