<L>__{interior enterprise bridge viewscreen}
<A>__{where riker, troi, worf and n.d.s are watching this image on the viewscreen.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{what are they doing?}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{they appear to be modifying the deflector dish.}
<C>__{troi}
<D>__{to do what? if they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{it doesn't make sense. the deflector is only used for shielding and long range sensors...}
<A>__{riker stares at the screen... notices something.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{computer magnify grid twenty one alpha.}
<A>__{the image on the viewscreen zooms in to a specific point on the deflector dish, giving us a clear view of two borg who have opened a gigantic panel on the dish. they appear top be modifying power conduits in some fashion.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{they're re routing the deflector power conduits...}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{computer thermal enhancement.}
<A>__{the image now is overlaid with an infrared view of what they're doing. the power conduits are glowing bright red, very hot we can see the heat signature travel back behind the dish and connect to a corkscrew shaped coil, which is pulsing.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{they're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...}
<C>__{worf}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{they're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...}
<C>__{troi}
<D>__{they may be trying to send a message to the other borg...the borg in this time period...}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{what kind of message?}
<C>__{riker}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{if it was me... i'd say "attack earth now... in the 21st century... they'll be too strong in the 24th."}
<A>__{they think about this for a moment as they watch the borg swarming on the deflector array.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{we have to stop them from sending that message.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{agreed. options?}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{destroy the deflector dish.}
<C>__{troi}
<D>__{can we aim our dorsal phasers at it?}
<A>__{riker shakes his head.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{we've lost control of all weapons systems... transporters are down... we can't get to a shuttlecraft... and it would take us too long to fight our way down to deflector control...}
<A>__{they think.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{there is another way, commander. do you remember your zero g combat training?}
<A>__{riker looks a little wary at the suggestion.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{i remember it made me sick.}
<C>__{troi}
<P>__{(to worf)}
<D>__{what are you suggesting?}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{i think mister worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll...}
<A>__{off their expressions...}
