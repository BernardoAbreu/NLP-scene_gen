<L>__{interior hallway day (flashback)}
<A>__{close on the little girl slung under the man's arm, as he carried her down the hall. she's scraping at the walls, the door jams, anything to try to free herself from him. her hand sweeps across a small table at the end of the hall, smashing over a glass vase.}

<L>__{interior amy's hotel room later}
<A>__{the room is dark, drained of all color the way things appear when we see in them in almost total darkness. amy's lying in bed on her stomach. the sheet has crumpled off of her. she's dressed only in her panties. abruptly, there's the sound of a wettish "thud" and amy seems to bounce a little. her eyes open, but she isn't alarmed. still lying on her back, she flicks her eyes this way and that, but, seeing nothing, she closes them again. a few seconds later, we see some black liquid trickle across her shoulder, coming from the unseen center of her back . it follows a course down her backbone, then swerves and finds a path along the inner edge of one of her shoulder blades, finally trickling down her neck. it continues to flow, staining the pillow by her face. she stirs slightly, clearly feeling the trickle. she puts her hand to her shoulder, smearing the black liquid. still half asleep, she tries to "brush" it off... but it continues to flow. finally, her eyes open. she sits up painfully and looks at her hands stained with this sticky black stuff. she stares at it, not quite awake enough to figure it out. she reaches over her shoulder, pulls her hand back, stained with the black stuff. she looks down at her pillow, also stained. confused, she rises, painfully awkward, and heads toward the bathroom. we can see that her feet leave blackish wet footprints across the floor as she moves toward the bathroom.}
