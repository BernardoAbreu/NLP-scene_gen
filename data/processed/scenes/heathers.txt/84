<L>__{exterior school parking lot morning}
<A>__{students come out of their cars.}
<L>__{interior hallway morning}
<A>__{typically hectic start of another day opening and slamming of locker action. veronica darts through the thoroughfare to her locker. a passing pauline fleming screeches to a halt, grabbing veronica as she chokes on some styrofoam cup coffee.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{veronica! j.d. told me you committed suicide last night!}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{where is he? where's j.d.?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{we have to talk. whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{get a job.}
<A>__{veronica storms away to her nearby locker. she swirls her locker combination and opens it. she glances down the hall and freezes. in the distance, j.d. moves mechanically down the hallway carrying a large gym bag, wearing a walkman. veronica climbs into her locker. she closes it until it is barely perceptibly ajar. j.d. strides past the locker and into the boys bathroom.}
<B>__{boys bathroom}
<A>__{j.d smoothly moves into a stall and closes the door. he turns off his walkman and ends the montage music.}
<B>__{the hallway}
<A>__{the hallway slowly clears as students go to class. the bell rings. a late student races through the empty hallway. veronica carefully hatches out of her locker. she treads down the hallway as if something were about to jump out at her.}
<B>__{the gym}
<A>__{a group of cheerleaders including heather mcnamara are lazily doing cartwheels on the gym floor. on a small stage set up beside them, other students are putting up folding chairs. principal gowan says "testing" into a microphone. j.d., toting the gym bag, quietly opens the gym door and slips inside. he swiftly moves unnoticed to a position underneath the bleachers.}
<B>__{the hallway}
<A>__{veronica peers around a corner to see an empty hallway.}
<B>__{under the bleachers}
<A>__{using heavy black masking tape, j.d. tapes a thermal bomb to a steel support beneath the bleachers. other thermal bombs can be discerned taped to other supports.}
<B>__{the empty hallway}
<A>__{veronica cautiously treads down the empty hallway, trying to keep in control. suddenly, packs of students burst from classroom doors behind veronica. the excited swarms of students move toward and past veronica, who has braked her troubled treading to stiffly contemplate her passing peers. she latches onto geek rodney in a panic. rodney looks down at his clutched arm with a nervous smile.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{rodney, where's everybody going?}
<C>__{rodney}
<D>__{it's friday.....}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{oh my god, the damn pep assembly....}
<C>__{rodney}
<D>__{yeah, these things are pretty artificial, but at least we all get out of class...}
<A>__{veronica ignores rodney's amiable attemots at conversation to inquisitively move forward through the crowd.}
<B>__{the gym}
<A>__{j.d. darts from out underneath the bleachers to the gym doors. he pops the doors open and sees the crowd of students move toward the gym. he suavely pauses then dashes down a nearby set of stairs.}
<B>__{the hallway leading to the gym}
<A>__{veronica continues to tensely surf the tidal wave of students heading for the gymnasium. she stops to watch her classmates file into the gym like lemmings with increasing sense of dread. she again latches onto a passing rodney.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{rodney, what's underneath the gym?}
<A>__{rodney (unconsciously) dramatically stops, turns to veronica. and says........}
<C>__{rodney}
<D>__{the boiler room.}
<A>__{veronica blanches then lunges through the crowd. she topples a couple disgruntled students before careening down the staircase beside the gym.}
<B>__{hallway outside the boiler room}
<A>__{j.d. walks by the firm glass windows of the boiler room, eyeing the pounding generators inside. he stops at a heavy steel door. placing down his gym bag, j.d. proceeds to swiftly pick the lock. he swings open the steel door.}
<C>__{veronica }
<D>__{may i see your hall pass?}
<A>__{j.d. weilds around. a sweating veronica moves toward him, pointing the bedroom gun at him.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{i knew that loose was too noose! i mean, noose too loose! goddamn you!}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{like father, like son. a serious as fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground.}
<A>__{j.d. looks down at the gym bag already on the ground. he folds his arms and smiles. veronica forcefully moves closer.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{okay, okay. i knew that. i knew that. put your hands on your head.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{you didn't say simon says.}
<A>__{j.d. suddenly kicks out into veronica's stomach, doubling her over and causing her to drop the gun. j.d. gracefully retrieves it.}
<B>__{the gym}
<A>__{the pep assembly is in full swing with rowdy students in the bleachers earthily shouting, giggling cheerleaders making swaying pyramids, valiant band members struggling to be heard. various jocks, including earl, stand on the stage with principal gowan as a yearbook photographer flashes away.}
<B>__{the hallway before the boiler room}
<A>__{veronica bends over quivering and clutching her bruised ribs. j.d. raises the gun to her head.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{live by the sword...}
<A>__{veronica swings her left arm up knocking j.d.'s gun hand upward. she then sails her right fist into his face. the blow annoys him more than it hurts him but j.d.'s momentary loss of composure allows veronica to come in with another much harder right hook. the blow sends j.d. stumbling back against the boiler room, jarring the gun loose. they simultaneously lunge for the gun. veronica, having the better grip, pulls so forecfully that after wrenching the gun from j.d., she loses control of it, flinging it down the hall. veronica pops up to retrieve it but j.d. moves his legs scissors style around her and trips her.}
<B>__{the prep assembly}
<A>__{the assembly mindlessly blares on. cheerleader heather mcnamara rah rah rahs. rodney and the other geeks pass around a pair of opera glasses, all intensely scoping out the cheerleaders. a group of stoners toke away beneath the bleachers, one of them lackadaisically leaning against a thermal bomb.}
<B>__{the boiler room hallway}
<A>__{a snarling j.d. stands up, pulling veronica with him.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{you think just because you started this thing, you can end it?}
<A>__{j.d. violently kisses bites veronica. while kissing, veronica sees a fire alarm on a nearby wall. she closes her eyes then savagely knees j.d. in the groin. veronica bolts to the alarm and pulls it down. nothing happens. j.d. gasps.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{you, really didn't think i'd, forget, forget, to disconnect the....}
<A>__{veronica rockets her body down and picks up the gun. j.d. grabs her and throws her against the steel boiler room door. a jostled veronica raises the gun. j.d. howls then bounds toward veronica, causing them both to careen down the steel steps of the boiler room. at the same time, he inadvertently kicks the gym bag bomb down along with them. the gun spins from veronica's hand and slides away. the bomb flies out of the bag onto the boiler room floor. a digital clock on the bomb clicks on at 5:00....4:59....4:58...}
<B>__{the pep assembly}
<A>__{the frenzied pep assembly crowd is now doing "the wave". betty finn and her similar co horts deliriously get into the act, all sit in a circle at the bottom rows of the bleachers, pouting as students bounce up and down around them. earl and the other jocks stand on the stage grinning and preening before the crowd.}
<B>__{the boiler room}
<A>__{veronica and j.d. are in a heap at the bottom of the boiler room steps. veronica faintly works into a semi sitting position and gives an astonished glance to the bomb, its digital clock clicking to 3:00. veronica crawls to the gun and levels it at a rousing up j.d.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{the bomb's gone on, j.d.! how do you turn it off? tell me!}
<A>__{fully standing, j.d. flicks open his switchblade. he gives veronica "the finger," screaming in exploded saliva...}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<A>__{seething, veronica shoots up at j.d. blowing off "the finger." shrieking in pain, j.d. drops the knife to hold this sudden geyser of blood. veronica achingly stands, pointing the gun. the bomb clicks down to 2:25.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{it's all over, j.d. help me to stop it.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{you want to wipe the slate clean as much as i do. okay, so maybe i am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. you have a purpose though! remember? let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.}
<A>__{veronica fires the gun at j.d.'s feet. the bomb clicks to 1:49.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{how do you turn the fucker off?}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{you're not listening. people are going to look at the ashes of westerburg and say there's a school that self destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school was society. is that deep or what? i will let you put it in your diary, babe. free of charge.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{the bomb, asshole!}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{just push the red button twice. that's what stops it. if that's what you want, babe?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{you know what i want, babe?}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{veronica fires the gun twice into j.d.'s throat. coughing and moaning, he splatters against a generator.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{cool guys like you out of my life.}
<A>__{veronica saunters to j.d.'s writhing body.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{but babe, don't worry, these here were ich luge bullets.}
<A>__{j.d. closes his eyes and slumps to the ground. veronica turns to the bomb and crouches over it. a lit green light is next to a green button. above it, an unlit red light is next to a red button. the bomb's digital clock clicks to 00:17. veronica presses the red button twice, turning on the red light and stopping the clock. veronica falls back into a sitting position and sorely exhales, tears streaming down her face.}
<B>__{the pep assembly}
<A>__{a cheerleader does a cartwheel in slow motion as eerie music plays. the manic crowd in the bleachers vibrates in slow motion as well. at normal speed, veronica walks to the doors of the gym and peers in. the panorama of roaring students, posing jocks, and prancing cheerleaders continues to unfold in slow motion. veronica walks away from the gym.}
