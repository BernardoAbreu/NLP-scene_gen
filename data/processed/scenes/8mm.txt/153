<A>__{welles' receiver tape recorder's set up by the window, recording, with the tone decoder plugged into it. welles listens through headphone, looking through binoculars.}

<D>__{... half a dozen. this is good stuff, jimbo...}
<A>__{through binoculars: eddie's at his desk, on the phone...}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{you know how my tapes sell. people eat this stuff up.}
<C>__{male voice }
<P>__{(from phone)}
<D>__{i had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month. do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?}
<C>__{male voice }
<D>__{the only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, eddie. where do you get this stuff?}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{look, you cocksucker...}
<C>__{male voice }
<D>__{get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head. till then, fuck you.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{fuck you!}
<A>__{through binoculars: eddie slams down the phone. he cannot be heard any longer. he's cursing, shuffling paperwork. welles takes off headphones, picks up his cellular phone. he drinks soda, opens the phone, dials, nervous, then looks back through the binoculars. he waits, clears his throat. the phone's ringing... ringing... on the floor, the reels of the tape recorder are turning... through binoculars: eddie answers the phone...}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{celebrity films.}
<C>__{welles }
<D>__{eddie.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{yeah, who's this?}
<C>__{welles }
<D>__{i know what you did.}

<C>__{welles }
<D>__{you murdered that girl, eddie. six years ago...}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{what the fuck are you.. ?}
<C>__{welles }
<D>__{you killed that girl and you put it on film. you and your pals, you're fucked. you fucked up real good.}
<A>__{welles hits disconnect, still looking through binoculars. through binoculars: eddie's slow to hang up the phone. he stands, looking down at the phone, frozen. finally, he runs his hands through his hair, looks around the room, sits back down. he gets out his bottle and pours himself a drink. welles watches through binoculars, puts headphones back on.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{come on, eddie...}
<A>__{through binoculars: eddie sits motionless.}
<C>__{welles }
<D>__{... come on...}
<A>__{through binoculars: eddie picks up the phone, dials a number. we hear the phone ring in the headphones}
<C>__{man's voice }
<P>__{(through headphones)}
<D>__{... hello?}
<C>__{eddie }
<P>__{(through headphones)}
<D>__{dino, it's eddie... eddie poole...}
<C>__{dino }
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{i just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.}
<C>__{dino }
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{the loop! the girl we did, what the fuck do you think i'm talking about?! this guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...}
<C>__{dino }
<D>__{bullshit.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{i'm telling you...}
<C>__{dino }
<D>__{blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible. why are you bothering me with this... ?}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!}
<C>__{dino }
<D>__{there's nothing there, you brain dead cunt. think about it. there's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything. i want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again i'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{dino...}
<C>__{dino }
<D>__{nobody knows anything.}
<A>__{through binoculars: as dino is heard hanging up, eddie reacts, picks up his phone and throws it across the office. welles sits back, trying to accept the realization that he's found them. he looks to the photo of the third man.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{that is you, isn't it, eddie?}
<A>__{welles goes to the recorder, turns on the tone decoder. its led window lights up. welles hits stop, rewind, play...}
<C>__{welles voice }
<P>__{(from recorder)}
<D>__{... and your pals, you're fucked...}
<A>__{hits fast forward... hits play, watching the tone decoder. from the recorder, the sound of eddie dialing a number on his touch tone phone... and as each tone is heard, acorresponding number appears on the decoder's led readout:...1 212 555 9906... the recorder continues, replaying the conversation between eddie and dino, while welles studies the green led digits.}
<C>__{welles}
<P>__{(quiet, to himself)}
<D>__{two one two.}
