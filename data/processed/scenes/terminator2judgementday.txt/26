<A>__{he sees vapor dissipating as he approaches the spot where he saw the strange light. he draws his revolver and cautiously moves into the shadows between the rows of pillars. a naked man glides from a shadowed doorway behind the cop. nothing special about him. certainly not built like a terminator. the flash of light and fact that he is naked are pretty good clues that he just arrived from the future. his features are handsome bordering on severe. his eyes are gray ice. penetrating. intelligent. the cop spins at a sound. too late. mr. x is already on him. the blow is lighting fast and the cop drops like a bag of sand. low angle as the unconscious cop hits the deck, his beretta 9mm automatic clattering next to him. a hand enters frame and picks up this pistol.}
