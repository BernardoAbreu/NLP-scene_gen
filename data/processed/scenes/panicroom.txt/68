<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{meg and sarah run through the master bedroom. as she passes the night table, sarah swings an open hand to grab her cell phone from its cradle. but in her haste she starts to pull it out at an angle and the prongs at the bottom stick in the charger. the phone slips from her fingers, bounces off the corner of the table, caroms off her foot, and skitters under the bed. sarah turns, looks to the head of the stairs just as junior turns the corner and raoul thunders down the steps from four. she abandons the phone, grabs sarah, and they lunge through the open doorway to the panic room. junior and raoul burst through the doorway to the bedroom, just a few steps away.}
