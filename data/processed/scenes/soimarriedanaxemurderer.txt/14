<A>__{tony and charlie enter. there is a poet on stage. the club is full of art tarts and college bohemians. they are greeted by the club's owner, giuseppi, an italian man in his fifties.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{salve zio mio.}
<C>__{uncle}
<D>__{allora? che catzo fai, charlie?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hi, uncle giuseppi.}
<C>__{uncle}
<D>__{tony, come' stai bello il tuo pappa e' in galera per la terza volta.}
<A>__{tony's uncle shows them to a table.}
<C>__{uncle}
<D>__{i will have the waitress bring you cappuccino.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what did your uncle say?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{he says my dad's back in jail again.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{ah, i'm sorry, man.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{you know, it's funny i don't even feel related to my parents anymore. i feel like your mom and dad are more like my parents. i feel more scottish than italian.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{tony spiletti, i don't think you could get more italian than that. unless of course your name was tony italian guy.}
<A>__{charlie checks out the girls in the coffee bar.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm so bummed. sherri was great, wasn't she? i'm an asshole, aren't i?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you've got to help me get through this night.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{you've just got to get back on the horse.}
<A>__{the waitress arrives with two cappuccinos in extremely large cups like they have in france.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{waitress, i'm sorry, there seems to be a mistake. i ordered the large cappuccino.}
<A>__{two girls at a nearby table, laugh. charlie and tony exchange, "this could be promising." looks.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(to the girls)}
<D>__{do you think these cups could be larger? they're practically bowls.}
<A>__{the girls laugh again.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i feel like i'm having campbell's cuppuccino.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{join us in a cup of coffee? there's enough room?}
<C>__{girls}
<D>__{sure!}
<A>__{the girls come over.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{my name's susan and this is june. we think you're funny.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{my name's tony. this is my friend charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{look, tony, i'm going home. see you later, girls.}
<A>__{tony grabs him and pulls him aside.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{you really don't understand, do you? when a girl comes over to your table and says, 'i think you're funny.' it means you've pretty much been given the keys to the city. charlie, this is big.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{perhaps you've confused me with someone who gives a shit. here's what's gonna happen, tony. we'll end up going out with them tonight, maybe even home with them. well go out for two months. soon she'll move in, we'll be happy, she'll want more of a commitment. i will be terrified and i will do something to ruin it. just like i did with sherri.}
<A>__{he leaves. tony is left with the two girls.}
<C>__{june}
<D>__{poor, guy... he seemed so nice.}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(talking, choked up)}
<D>__{i just broke up with somebody as well. she left me high and dry.}
<A>__{the girls try to comfort him.}
