<L>__{41 de la lyre market. outside. day. 9:10 a.m.}
<A>__{the cries of the peddlers are loud and incoherent. an algerian is squatting on his heels in front of his wares scattered on the ground: clusters of aromatic herbs, jars of spices. a youth is in front of him, and from time to time, he looks around him. he seems to be waiting. now he bends down and begins to rummage through the herbs. he selects a bunch of mint, weighs it in his hand, and argues the price with the peddler. a policeman in the market passes nearby and watches. the youth waits a second, then turns toward the back of the policeman, and stretches out his arm. he has in his hand the bunch of mint; a revolver is hidden among the greens. he shoots twice. the french policeman falls down. the youth drops the mint with the revolver among the other herbs, and moves away in the midst of the crowd.}
