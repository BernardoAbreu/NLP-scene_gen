<P>__{(beat)}

<A>__{she grabs a small potted plant off the table and throws it at him. it narrowly misses his head, exploding against the wall.}
<C>__{stephanie }
<D>__{fucking piece of shit asshole!}
<A>__{she grabs a can of soda off the same table and throws it. it nails him in the thigh, exploding open on the floor. soda sprays everywhere.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{jesus! stop!}

<D>__{you don't mean it!}
<A>__{suddenly, she stops resisting. a strange and unexpected calm washes over her.}
<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{i don't mean it?}
<A>__{she is silent and still.}
<C>__{stephanie }
<D>__{you're right. i don't.}
<A>__{she shakes her head, placidly gazing off.}
<C>__{stephanie }
<D>__{i don't know why i got so hysterical. there's no reason. i don't hate you. i don't love you. i don't like you. i was stupid to think you could change.}
