<L>__{exterior ruined base camp night}
<A>__{in the ruins of the first team's base camp, the survivors of the night's two separate catastrophes stand face to face, in a heated argument. malcolm sits off to the side, still holding kelly in his arms, just looking down at the ground and shaking his head. there's something about his posture of defeat that is far more ominous than any of the hot tempers that are flaring. ludlow rants to sarah while dieter looms menacingly over nick.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{trespassing, sabotage you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!}
<A>__{dr. juttson has encountered dr. burke.}
<C>__{juttson}
<D>__{what are you doing here, burke? there's no tv cameras, what's the point?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{dr. juttson, you exist outside the classroom. i am amazed.}
<A>__{dieter continues to get in nick's face.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{are you looking for a problem?}
<C>__{juttson}
<P>__{(an urgent whisper)}
<D>__{everyone, keep your voices down!}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{back off, dieter.}
<C>__{juttson}
<D>__{listen to me, by moving the baby rex into our camp, we changed the adults' perceived territory!}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{their what?}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(she understands)}
<D>__{oh, god.}
<C>__{juttson}
<D>__{that's why they persisted in destroying the trailers, they now feel they have to defend this entire area! we're not safe here.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<P>__{(of sarah and nick)}
<D>__{thanks to you people.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip mine the place! it's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{none of that matters. our communications equipment's been destroyed. if your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and i'm guessing by the look on his face }
<A>__{he points at malcolm, who is still off to the side, sitting in stunned silence. malcolm looks up and nods, slowly. the grimness of their situation sinks in.}
<C>__{roland }
<D>__{we are stuck here, ladies and gentlemen. and we're stuck together.}
