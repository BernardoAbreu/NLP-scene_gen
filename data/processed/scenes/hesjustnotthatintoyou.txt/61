<A>__{ben comes in the front door, drops his gym bag. janine sits on the couch flipping through a magazine. he leans in to kiss her on the cheek. she does not look happy.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{honey you smell different.}
<A>__{ben pulls back smoothly.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{different how?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well that's an odd thing to say.}
<A>__{she looks at him. he tries to coolly meet her gaze.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{maybe it's the ashtray and cigarettes i found. in the side yard. what part of "my dad died of lung cancer" is hard for you to wrap your brain around?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{do not lie to me, ben. please.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{are you serious? we have like eight thousand undocumented workers in this house daily. you find cigarettes, and you automatically assume they're mine?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{well, yes.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{honey, i'm not lying. and you are really freaking out. i think the renovation is getting to you because nothing is going on. just please relax.}
<A>__{ben walks away. off janine, wanting to believe him.}
