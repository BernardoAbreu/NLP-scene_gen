<L>__{interior rutaganda's warehouse. day}
<A>__{at his desk in front of a fan. george rutagunda, late 30's, huge, gold chains, rolex watch, (like an african mafia boss) but the same interahamwe shirt. he squeezes an orange rind into a cup of espresso. behind him, through his office window, the white van is being loaded with cases of beer. george holds out his massive shirt.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you will join us at the rally today?}
<A>__{paul sits opposite, sipping coffee.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i will try my best george but these days i have no time for rallies or politics.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{politics is power, paul. and money.}
<A>__{paul studies his watch.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{time is money, george. we need extra beer today.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{business is good at the hotel?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{very good.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i am always glad to see you paul.}
<A>__{george leads paul out into the warehouse. as a forklift lifts a wooden crate, george angers.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{hell man, that is not beer, put it back!}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{but, sir, the carlsberg is behind...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{forget the carlsberg, give him grolsch.}
<P>__{(to paul)}
<D>__{i won't charge extra.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{the driver of the forklift, anxiously, spins the machine to return the crate but it slides off and crashes onto the floor: machetes, hundreds of them, spill out. an awkward moment then george picks one of the crude blades.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{a bargain buy, from china. ten cents each, i will get a dollar.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{at least.}
<A>__{off zozo terrified.}
