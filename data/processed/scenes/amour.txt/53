<L>__{interior apartment day}
<A>__{the various paintings hanging in the apartment. without their frames. like views on various realities. silence. sometimes, the remote sound of traffic in the distance.}
<L>__{interior hallway living room dining room day}
<A>__{living room. georges is drinking tea and reading the newspaper. silence. suddenly, the doorbell rings. georges, annoyed, puts down his newspaper, gets up, goes into the hallway and goes to the front door.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{who's there?}
<C>__{eva's voice}
<D>__{it's me.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{eva?}
<C>__{eva's voice}
<P>__{(a bit irritated)}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{georges, panicked, thinks for a few seconds.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{just a minute.}
<A>__{he goes toward the bedroom door, locks it and puts the key in his pocket. he goes into the dining room, also closes the door leading to the bedroom. he comes back. he is about to go toward the front door, but remains motionless an instant, opens the door of the toilet that is located just nearby, flushes the toilet, closes the toilet door again and opens the front door.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{a brief kiss hello.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{hello. what was going on?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{i was in the toilet. sorry.}
<A>__{he closes the front door behind eva, indicates the direction of the living room.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{eva points to the bedroom with a questioning look. he shakes his head as if to play down the question, and indicates back in the direction of the living room, as if to say: "you understand, huh?". eva is slightly irritated, but follows him into the living room. he closes the door.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{why this unannounced visit? where have you come from?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{what's going on with mom?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{nothing. what should be going on?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{well... (gesture toward the}
<P>__{bedroom)}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{don't you want to sit down first?}
<A>__{eva wants to answer, but finally gives in and sits down. georges does the same.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{so why are you in paris?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{what's going on with mom? why don't you answer the phone? after our last conversation, i left four messages on your answering machine. why don't you call back?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{sorry. i didn't listen to it. forgive me.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{don't you realize we're worried?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{your worries are no use to me.}
<A>__{eva glares at him.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{no, don't get me wrong. i'm not criticizing you. i just don't have the time to deal with your worries, that's all.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{dad...}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{no. let's stop this conversation right there. i'm taking care of your mother. it's a full time job. and i'm not saying that to complain, just to explain why i didn't answer your phone calls and why i don't want to have any pointless discussions on the subject. your mother is just as could have been expected: bad the whole time.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{she is turning more and more into a helpless child, and it's sad and humiliating, for her and for me. and she doesn't want to be seen in that state either. even the last time you visited, she didn't want you to come. you two have your own life. nothing wrong with that. but let us have our life too. even though it's a lousy one. ok?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{dad, what's the matter?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{nothing's the matter; your visit caught me by surprise. and i'm annoyed that you show up here to check that everything's ok. who do you think you are?}
<A>__{pause. eva is speechless.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{i...}
<A>__{then she gets up and makes to go to the door.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{stay here, will you!}
<A>__{she stops short, looks at him.}
<C>__{georges }
<P>__{(softly, but insistently)}
<D>__{please!}
<A>__{she hesitates a moment, but winds up leaving the living room.}
<B>__{we hear her pass in the hallway to go into the bedroom and her vain attempt to open the door.}
<C>__{eva }
<D>__{mom? ... mom??}
<A>__{georges remains seated, motionless, until she comes back. she seems upset by the situation, as one would expect.}
<C>__{eva }
<D>__{tell me, what's going on? have you gone crazy?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{please, sit down.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{i don't want to sit down. what's going on here?}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{nothing's going on. i want to spare us all a pointless drama. i presume your mother is asleep. she mostly sleeps the whole day. and then she wakes up at night. if you really want to, we'll go and see her in a little while. now, sit down. ok?}
<A>__{they look at each other. reluctantly, eva heads toward her armchair and sits down. pause. then georges goes on in a quiet voice:}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{we do our speech exercises every day, or we sing together. most of the time, i wake up around 5. at that time, she's still awake. then we change her incontinence pad. i rub cream on her to avoid sores. then, around 7, i try to persuade her to eat and drink. sometimes it works, sometimes not. sometimes she tells me things from her childhood, then for hours she calls for help, and then an instant later she's giggling away to herself, or crying. nothing of any of that is worth showing to anyone.}
<A>__{silence. eva looks down. finally, she says:}
<C>__{eva}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{you can't stop me from seeing her.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(also softly)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{they remain seated for a moment, finally eva gets up. georges follows her into the hallway. he unlocks the door and they enter the bedroom. the bright light from outside filters through the blinds. eva goes over to the bed, looks at anne. finally, she caresses her face, shyly and clumsily. anne opens her eyes. looks at her. no movement.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{it's me, mom.}
<A>__{anne emits a furious sound.}
<C>__{eva }
<P>__{(helpless)}
<D>__{can i do something for you? mom...}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{mom... mom... mom... mom... mom...}
<B>__{silence.}
<A>__{georges has remained by the door. after a while, they both leave the bedroom, cross the hallway to come back in the living room. georges closes the door. for an instant he puts a consoling hand on eva's shoulder. then he sits down. eva, trying to compose herself, goes toward the window and looks outside. suddenly she starts sobbing. after a while, georges gets up and goes out of the room. eva, vexed, blows her nose. shortly after, georges comes back. he has another teacup in his hand, puts it down beside his on the table and sits down.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{the tea isn't very hot any more.}
<A>__{eva turns toward him.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{but it does make you feel better.}
<A>__{after a short pause, eva comes toward the table. sits down. he fills her cup.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{she takes the cup, drinks. replaces it. still can't bring herself to look at him.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{it was silly of me to lock the door. i'm sorry. you took me by surprise, that's all. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{she nods her head, indicating she understands. finally she looks at him:}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{what's going to happen now?}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(with a little ironic laugh)}
<D>__{what's going to happen now? the nurse comes twice a week, and every two weeks dr. bertier and the hairdresser come. that's what you want to know, right? things will go on as they have done up until now. they'll go from bad to worse. things will go on, and then one day it will all be over.}
<A>__{brief pause.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{you can't go on like this, dad.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{can't i? what do you suggest?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{can't we have a serious talk, you and me?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{what do you call "a serious talk"? what do you want to suggest? do you want to have mom live with you? do you want to pack her off to a care home? do you? what do you want? go on, talk to me "seriously"!}
<A>__{eva looks at him.}
