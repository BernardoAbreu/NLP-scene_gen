<A>__{racine is behind the desk. occupying the two seats in front are a married couple rapidly approaching divorce. they are arguing now, each trying to convince racine of their view. racine nods occasionally, looking from one to the other. but he is also looking between them, through the open door out to the reception room, where his secretary beverly is kneeling before the lowest drawer of a filing cabinet. her back is turned and her jeans are tight across the bottom. there's nothing especially provocative about her pose. she's just there. working away.}
