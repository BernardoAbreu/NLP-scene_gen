<A>__{vogel leans against the wall, staring blankly at the window, sunk into a profound depression. he looks filthy, jaw dark with beard growth. rachel watches him from the doorway.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{rachel is washing vogel's face with a towel. he pays no attention, continuing to stare out of the window. rachel picks up a bowl of shaving cream, strips the tape off vogel's mouth, and begins to brush the cream over his face. she produces a razor and carefully begins to shave his cheeks. she stops suddenly, a tear is running down vogel's cheek, cutting a line through the soap. he turns his eyes to her.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{why don't you just kill me now?}
<A>__{rachel pauses for a moment.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{how can you keep me waiting to die like this!}
<A>__{rachel keeps on shaving.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{i know what you want. you want to hand me over to the others, let there be some fucking sham of a trial. then, when they kill me, you can tell yourself that there was no blood on your hands.}
<A>__{rachel switches to the other cheek. vogel's getting more animated, tears in his eyes, a kind of bizarre indignation...}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{but that isn't true. there will be blood on your hands.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{you will be my murderer! you fucking hypocrite. you fucking...}
<A>__{rachel tilts his chin up a little and puts the razor to his throat. he falls silent, tenses, waiting. then...}
<C>__{vogel }
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{yes. do it. you want to do it...}
<A>__{rachel finishes with a trembling hand. vogel slumps back against the wall, the tension in his body easing away. he gives her a long, calculating look. and as we watch some change seems to come over him, some new fire beginning to kindle in him a sense of cold contempt for rachel and with it, perhaps, a fresh determination to survive this.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{that's right. i'd forgotten. you jews never knew how to kill. only how to die.}
<A>__{rachel wipes the razor clean on the towel, slaps fresh tape onto vogel's mouth and gets up.}
