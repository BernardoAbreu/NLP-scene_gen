<A>__{through the view finder of the camera, we are now brought into close proximity with the salesman in his little kitchen. his back is still to us. he half turns and takes a used newspaper. he spreads it open, along the drainboard. from the sink he takes out a large butcher's knife, and a long, narrow saw. they disappear from sight as he lays them on the newspaper and proceeds to wrap them up. having completed his job, he emerges from the kitchen carrying the newspaper wrapped parcel. for a moment he is lost behind the wall that separates the kitchen recess from the living room. he does not reappear for a moment.}
