<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{motherfucker! this how you do things?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{yeah... when i want to talk to someone, without giving the impression he's cooperatin'.}
<A>__{jesse pauses, caught by bud's tactics. the guards file out and shut the door. jesse's eyes are fierce and watching bud's every movement as he hands him a coffee, then takes a seat...}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{you got a problem.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{yeah, what's that?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{to start with, you're lookin' at two hundred years.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i've done the time. i will do it again.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i know you can do it. but can your family?}

<C>__{bud}
<D>__{your brother's dead, jesse. as we're sittin' here now, he's on a slab at st. gabriel's morgue. the coroner's callin' it, "suicide". you and i both know that's a load of shit.}

<C>__{bud}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{jesse's sudden directness has caught bud off guard.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{who do you hate the most? blacks you throw in prison?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{...i dislike what they represent in the system. not as a whole.}
<A>__{and jesse begins to consciously or unconsciously "preach."}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{and you believe that by overthrowin' aryan nationalism and integratin' races...polluted creeds, with us...you believe you're solvin' somethin'?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i believe we survive by integrating safety. understanding hate, and how to stop it.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{it ain't evil to fight it. it's evil to tolerate it.}
<P>__{(leans in)}
<D>__{maybe you forget that, to justify what you do for a living...}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{are we still in prison, or we back at the compound, havin' mass?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{you don't get it.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{no, don't dictate to me what put you in here, or question my intentions with your overcooked revolution!}

<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{in who i am, there's pressure! i work for you, i won't need a lawyer, i will need a priest! my outside finance is gone... my wife and son, their heads wind up somewhere their bodies ain't! so tell me, why the fuck should i get involved with you?!}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{how about personal warranty?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{warranty?!}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{yeah, that's right! you've been a part of the problem so long, you've forgotten what the fuck that is!}
<P>__{(boaring in)}
<D>__{"finance..." your wife came here on a bus to see you. i sent her home in a cab. is that your outside fuckin' finance?!}
<A>__{beat. jesse, taken back.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{let me give you a little insight, pal. as to what i know... and what you think you know.}

<D>__{look at your wife, jesse. look at her face. and your son. they look safe to you?}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{i'm all you've got! i'm all your family's got! and the longer you're in here, they're up for grabs.}
<A>__{on jesse. the wheels turning. burning. the camera moves in...}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{so either you let that happen... or i get the judge to allow bond. this never sees trial. and you work for me.}
<A>__{and that's where it hangs...}
