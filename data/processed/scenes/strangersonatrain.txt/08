<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior bruno's compartment on train (process)}
<A>__{bruno and guy are finishing lunch. bruno has been drinking and his eyes are bright and feverish. an almost empty liquor bottle is near a couple of detective novels covered with gaudily illustrated dust jackets. bruno has in unlighted cigarette in his mouth. guy's lighter is on the table. bruno snaps it a couple of times, as though fascinated, lights his cigarette and puts the lighter on the table again.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{sure, i went to college. three of them. every time they kicked me out my father threw me back in.}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{he finally gave up. he thinks i'm awfully small fry, not worth the bait.}
<P>__{(wistfully)}
<D>__{you my friend, guy?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{sure. i'm your friend, bruno.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(a little woozy)}
<D>__{no, you're not, nobody thinks i'm anything special. only my mother.}
<P>__{(empties the bottle into his glass)}
<D>__{my father hates me.}
<A>__{guy smiles this off as nonsense.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you must be imagining things.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(hitting the bottom}
<D>__{of the bottle for}
<P>__{the last drop)}
<D>__{and i hate him. he thinks i ought to catch the eight five bus every morning, punch a timeclock and work my way up selling paint or something. him with all his money!}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(amused by bruno)}
<D>__{well, what do you want to do?}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{you mean before or after i kill him?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{before, of course.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(leaning forward eagerly)}
<D>__{i want to do everything. i got a theory you're supposed to do everything before you die. have you ever driven a car, blindfolded, at a hundred and fifty miles an hour?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{not lately.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{i did. i flew in a jet plans too.}
<P>__{(his hand traces a}
<D>__{swift streak through the air, and he adds}
<P>__{sound effects)}
<D>__{zzzzzzzp! man, that's a thrill! almost blow the sawdust out of my head. i'm going to make a reservation on the first rocket to the moon...}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(amused and curious)}
<D>__{what are you trying prove?}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{i'm not like you, guy. you're lucky. you're smart. marrying the boss's daughter is a nice short cut to a career, isn't it?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{marrying the senator's daughter has nothing to do with it. can't a fellow look past a tennis not without being a goldbricker?}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{take it easy, boy. i'm your friend, remember? i'd do anything for you.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(humoring bruno)}
<D>__{sure, bruno, sure.}
<C>__{guy }
<P>__{(glancing at his watch)}
<D>__{we'll be pulling in soon. i've got to change trains.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{what'd you say her name was your wife's?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{miriam.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{that's it. miriam joyce haines. played around a lot, i suppose?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{let's not talk about it any more.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(almost hopefully)}
<D>__{maybe she'll make more trouble for you.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{you mean you got enough on her to get your divorce no matter what?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{let's change subject, bruno, can't we?}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{okay, guy. want me to tell you one of my ideas for murdering my father?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(indicating the detective novels)}
<D>__{you've been reading too many of these.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(going right on)}
<D>__{you want to hear about the busted light socket in the bathroom, or the carbon monoxide in the garage?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{no. i may be old fashioned, but i thought murder was against the law.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{but not against the law of nature. my theory is that everybody is a potential murderer. didn't you ever want to kill somebody? say one of those useless fellows miriam was running around with?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you can't go around killing people just because you think they're useless.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{oh, what's a life or two? some people are bitter off dead, guy. take your wife and my father, for instance. it reminds me of a wonderful idea had once. i used to put myself to sleep at night figuring it out. now, let's say you want to get rid of your wife.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{let's say she refuses to give you a divorce }
<P>__{(raises a finger and stops guy's protest)}
<D>__{let's say. you'd be afraid to kill her because you'd get caught. and what would trip you up? motive. now here's the plan...}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i'm afraid i haven't time to listen.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(ignoring the remark)}
<D>__{it's so simple, too. a couple of fellows meet accidentally, like you and me. no connection between them at all. never saw each other before. each of them has somebody he'd like to get rid of, but he can't murder the person he wants to get rid of. he'll get caught. so they swap murders.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{swap murders?}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{each fellow does the other fellow's murder. then there is nothing to connect them. the one who had the motive isn't there. each fellow murders a total stranger. like you do my murder and i do yours.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(with relief)}
<D>__{we're coming into my station.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{for example, your wife, my father. criss cross.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{we do talk the same language don't we, guy?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(preparing to leave)}
<D>__{sure, we talk the same language. thanks for the lunch.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(beaming)}
<D>__{i'm glad you enjoyed it. i thought the lamb chops were a little overdone myself.}
<A>__{he holds out his hand. guy is in a hurry but he shakes hands.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{nice meeting you, bruno.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(detaining him at the door)}
<D>__{you think my theory is okay, guy? you like it?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{sure, sure, bruno. they're all okay.}
<P>__{(he salutes a quick}
<D>__{goodbye and hurries}
<P>__{away)}
<A>__{left alone, bruno picks up guy's lighter from the table, starts to call guy back to hand it to him.then he looks closer at the insignia of crossed tennis rackets.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{criss cross.}
