<C>__{newscaster }
<D>__{... strangely enough, scientific records do support the fact that we are heading for the biggest solar climax in recorded history...}
<A>__{a small tremor rocks the apartment and the dishevelled face of jackson curtis, 33, pops up from behind the couch. he fell asleep at his laptop last night.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{oh no. not again.}
<A>__{one look at his watch and he is off running. he throws some clothes and a toothbrush in a bag. his cell phone rings.}
<C>__{jackson }
<D>__{hello?... what do you mean? i'm not late. it's not even 10:30...}
<A>__{jackson turns off the tv and darts towards the door, stopping only to slide his laptop into a knapsack. as he turns, he stumbles over a stack of books, all shrink wrapped and identically titled: `farewell atlantis'.}
<C>__{jackson }
<D>__{damn it!}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{kate, i'm on my way... for god's sake...}
<A>__{frustrated, he kicks them out of his way and exits. we hold on the books and realize that jackson's photograph is on their back covers.}
