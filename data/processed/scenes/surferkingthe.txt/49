<A>__{robbie sees a door marked, "employees only". he looks down at his employee id and shrugs and goes in. as he enters we see he is pushed out by some unknown force. out the open door comes "wally" the water world mascot, who walks off. robbie has been knocked to the ground and looks up, shaking his head. he gets up and walks off.}
