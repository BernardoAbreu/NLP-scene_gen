<C>__{sportscaster's voice }
<D>__{allright, bowl bid ridin' here for e.s.u. fourth down on the georgia tech 18. 4 ticks left. kane sets 'em down.}
<T>__{instant cut to:}
<A>__{line of taped knuckles night smashing into the mud, as a football offensive line comes set, frosted breath steaming across to: the defensive line digging in, ready to explode.}
<B>__{close on joe kane}
<A>__{e.s.u. quarterback, barking signals. the ball is snapped, and we go to slow motion as the lines crash together in the slop. joe rolls to the right, looking downfield. a huge defensive end bears down on him. joe jukes. the end whips on by, grabbing for jersey, slipping off. but big number 75 is closing the gap. on the run, joe releases a desperation pass toward the end zone, just as 75 catches him and buries him face down in the swamp. we follow the ball, spiraling through the slanting rain. ray griffen, black running back, glances back for it, two defensive backs with him. all three leap in unison, climbing as high as they can, clutching, clawing for the ball. the ball floats down, kisses off the tangle of fingers, splashes to the ground, and rolls to a stop in the mud. incomplete. the bang of the final gun snaps us back to live action. joe on his knees in the muck, stares at the goal line, then drops his head in defeat.}
<B>__{angle on sam winters}
<A>__{betraying little emotion, coach sam winters, wiry, intense, early 50's, takes off his headset, lets it drop, heads across the field.}
<P>__{reporter #1 (v.o.)}
<D>__{coach, this is the second year in a row you've failed to go to a bowl game. do you feel your program's in decline?}
<L>__{interior locker room night}
<A>__{coach winters stands outside his office surrounded by reporters, a bouquet of microphones stuck in his face.}
<C>__{winters}
<P>__{(keeping his cool)}
<D>__{no, we're just a young team on the verge. we'll be back in a major bowl next year.}
<A>__{elsewhere in the locker room, we pick up a weary, mud splattered joe kane taking off his pads in front of his locker. alvin mack, black linebacker, comes by. alvin exudes danger; big, fast and hostile on the field, slightly surly, a sense of repressed anger off it.}
<C>__{alvin}
<D>__{good throw, joe. it was there.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{so was half their team.}
<P>__{(trailing off)}
<D>__{shit, another christmas at home.}
<C>__{alvin}
<D>__{next year, man. next year we sell out. next year we dominate.}
<B>__{on coach winters again}
<A>__{still fielding questions.}
<D>__{reporter #2 you still need a deep threat or a breakaway back to go with joe kane. what are you gonna do to address this need?}
<C>__{coach winters}
<P>__{(a little edgy)}
<D>__{stop wastin' my time talkin' to you guys for a start.}
<A>__{as winters gets up to go, we hear:}
<C>__{wilson }
<D>__{i'm not gonna lead you into the fog here, sam...}
<L>__{interior chancellor wilson's office day}
<A>__{chancellor grant wilson, 60, grey haired eminence, sits behind his desk. seated across from him are coach winters and galen howard, 50, the athletic director.}
<C>__{chancellor wilson}
<D>__{i'm concerned about our program. it's always been a source of pride to our students and alumni, but two straight so so seasons are having a damaging effect on our fund raising, both public and private.}
<C>__{winters}
<P>__{(half joking)}
<D>__{then stop raising the entrance requirements on me. we never could have gotten alvin mack in here under the new guidelines.}
<C>__{chancellor wilson}
<D>__{as chancellor, my first responsibility is to the academic interests of this university.}
<A>__{wilson points to a representation of a football field affixed to the wall. a football rests on the 40 yard line, which is marked 160 million. the end zone (60 yards away) is $400,000,000.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{at a time when we're committed to a 400 million dollar building program, alumni donations are down 15% the last two years. because they've also voiced their displeasure to their legislators, we can expect a corresponding drop in state funds.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{the athletic fund is suffering too. season tickets sales are off, merchandising's slow...}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{you layin' all this at my door? there's been a recession on.}
<C>__{chancellor wilson}
<D>__{yes, but the heaviest drop has been from the big donors, the 100,000 dollar club. these people are recession proof. they sit in my box every game, and they're much more generous when we're ranked and going to bowl games. two of them, as you know, are on the board of regents, including the chairman.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{what are you trying to say to me, grant? after 12 years, my job's in jeopardy?}
<C>__{chancellor wilson}
<D>__{i'm not prepared to discuss your job right now; i just want you to be aware of the situation. the alumni and the legislature are unhappy and they vote with their checkbooks. i don't pretend to be an expert on football, sam, and i will deny that this conversation ever took place, but i do know we need to win next year.}
<L>__{interior stadium tunnel late afternoon}
<A>__{coach winters flanked by two assistant coaches, humes and clayton, walks down a cavernous tunnel beneath the stands to a waiting car. at the end of the tunnel, a scarecrow effigy of coach winters hangs from an overhead pipe.}
<C>__{clayton}
<P>__{(ignoring the effigy)}
<D>__{tickets are in your coat. itinerary and player profiles are in your briefcase. we got a 9:00am tomorrow in philly with this kid darnell jefferson.}
<A>__{coach winters stops, looks up at the effigy. humes and clayton fear an outburst, a display of rage.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{looks like i've lost weight.}
<A>__{that's it. he strides on. humes and clayton race to catch up.}

<A>__{winters, humes, clayton and joe kane sit across from darnell jefferson and reverend wallace in a tattered parlor room. other boys of various ages and color look in from the adjoining door. darnell is black, good looking, street hip, the letters d.j. shaved in block letters into his fade.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{darnell, you have the potential to start for us as a freshman. that 108 yard kickoff return you made against taft? one of the greatest runs i've ever seen a high school player make. now, michigan is set at tailback for two years. you won't play till you're a junior. with joe here gettin' you the ball, runnin' 28 thunder right, you'll be all american with us as a sophomore.}
<C>__{reverend wallace}
<D>__{yes, but i'm really more concerned with darnell's education. he came here late. he's got some catching up to do.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{believe me, education is the first priority in our program. that's why all the players are smarter than me. after all, a football coach is smart enough to understand the game, but dumb enough to think it's important.}
<A>__{this gets a little chuckle from the reverend. it was intended to.}

<C>__{winters}
<D>__{yeh, but we can't sit and wait till he kills somebody. i hate to lose him as much as you do, but we gotta clean him up before he does somethin' that lands the whole program on probation. plus, we have to take some action or the girl's dad is gonna start havin' second thoughts. i don't care how many checks he's written.}

<C>__{winters}
<D>__{doesn't make any difference. it made the papers, all the wire services. the guy had to go to the hospital. worst of all they got you on drunk driving. you had a blood alcohol level .50 above the legal limit. we can't smooth that over, joe. it'd look like we were sprayin' pledge on bird shit. we had to agree to send you to rehab.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{rehab? i will be a god damn joke. you can't do this to me.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{it was the only way we could get them to drop the assault and d.w.i. you go to trial on those, we lose you for a year, and risk ncaa investigation. c'mon, lotsa athletes have been through rehab.}

<C>__{howard}
<D>__{the facts are, all we have left are freshman quarterbacks, and nothin' i saw at practice today, convinced me that any of them are ready to step in.}

<C>__{fowler}
<D>__{therefore, i respectfully submit that bobby collins should not be given special treatment just because he's a football player. would a regular student get a reinstatement hearing if they'de been caught cheating? nobody's talking about letting the girl who took the test back in.}
<A>__{winters could kill this kid.}
<C>__{learnihan}
<D>__{i think it's also instructive to look at some of the courses this young man has taken. beginning golf, voice and speech improvement...}

<D>__{would you like to respond, coach winters?}

<C>__{winters}
<D>__{i don't know much about all this other stuff, but i do know the punishment should fit the crime. cheating's bad, but i don't think it deserves a life sentence. here's one of those athletes who takes college level courses, who wants to graduate. i think bobby collins made a big mistake, but he's already been suspended for several weeks. he's served his time. i think he deserves a second chance.}
<C>__{learnihan}
<D>__{like alvin mack? we gave him a second chance and since he's had 5 incompletes, 4 withdrawals and still reads at a fourth grade level. you're using his body to make money for the athletic department you, yourself, are making three times what the chancellor is but obviously no one is making an effort to see that this kid gets an education.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{he's helpin' to pay for your physics lab too. if you're willin' to go without a new office, maybe i could hold him out a few games. save his body.}

<C>__{shane}
<D>__{alvin was way behind in school when he got here. you can't make up for, in four years, what it took 18 to create.}
<C>__{learnihan}
<D>__{then he should never have been admitted in the first place. it's not fair to other students who worked hard to get here.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{is it fair to exclude kids who come from inferior schools? you hold everybody to the same standards, you're discriminating against the poor kids.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{most of my players are farm boys, inner city kids. football is their deliverance.}
<C>__{learnihan}
<D>__{deliverance from what? a valid education?}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{you throw bobby collins and alvin out, you take away their futures. in alvin's case you probably cost him a couple million dollars in the pros.}
<C>__{learnihan}
<D>__{but this is not a football vocational school. it's an institute of higher learning.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{yeh, but when was the last time 80,000 people showed up to watch a kid do a chemistry experiment?}
<C>__{chairman}
<D>__{gentlemen, please, let's get back to the business at hand, bobby collins. as you know, i played football here. and i remember how hard it was to practice and then study when you're dead tired. so i have some sympathy for this young man. but i never cheated, so the real question is his character. since you know him better than anyone else in this room; and having talked to him and observed him over the last several weeks, do you feel he's learned his lesson? in other words, can you vouch for his character?}
<A>__{winters would rather cut off his own head with a razor blade.}

<A>__{he starts the wolf howl. the others join in, howling for all they're worth, eleven jacked up warriors. they clap and break the huddle. the crowd is standing, waving fists in unison toward the georgia tech end zone. joe looks up in the stands again at the seat he left for his father. it's still empty.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{this one's for you, dad.}
<A>__{joe starts to call signals as bud lite sings "bali hi." we go to slow motion as the ball is snapped. the georgia tech defense fires off the line, throwing everything at joe. joe drops back five steps. bud lite picks up a blitzing linebacker, knocks him over a fallen player. joe looks for darnell in the corner, but another pass rusher breaks through, forcing joe out of the pocket. it's wartime as tackles and blockers collide, hand fight, go down, scramble up, collide again, all in pursuit of joe. darnell, realizing joe's in trouble, breaks off his pattern and heads to the center of the end zone. joe dodges one tackler, shakes free of another's ankle tackle, heads back for the center of the field. he spots darnell breaking between defensive backs. just as he's buried by two massive linemen, joe fires a rocket down the middle toward the sliver of open space that darnell is heading for. the ball barely clears the hands of a lunging linebacker. darnell and two defensive backs, one from each side, close on the ball as it cuts through the air, a perfect spiral. darnell dives. the two defensive backs dive. the ball passes between their outstretched hands by a fraction of an inch, landing in darnell's. he clutches it to his chest, rolls over, holds the ball up for the ref to see. touchdown! this time darnell does go into his touchdown dance.}
