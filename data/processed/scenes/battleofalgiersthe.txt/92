<L>__{91 shops. doors unhinged. outside. morning.}
<A>__{a truck in reverse, a rope fastened to the hub of the wheels, its other end to a door latch. the motor is accelerated, clouds of exhaust fumes ... door latches pried open like lids of sardine cans, shop windows smashed with machine gun butts, the counters, the shelves, flung into the air, the merchandise thrown into the streets; a game, a frenzied excitement ... the algerians watch, but can not intervene. some shopkeepers rush to the scene, crying despairingly, while others are dragged away forcibly, tossed about, slapped, pushed, forced to open their shops.}
