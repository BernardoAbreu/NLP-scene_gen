<P>__{(addressing the camera)}
<D>__{ wanted to show you what i was talking about.}
<A>__{andrew takes the camera, and angles it down at his arm. he takes the kitchen knife, and presses the tip into the flesh of his wrist. he drags the blade down hard, all the way to his elbow...but no cut appears. he then violently jabs himself several times...but no penetration.}
<C>__{andrew }
<D>__{see, it's i put a little sheet between myself and the knife, and the barrier, the sheet, is too strong. the knife can't cut it. i mean like, what i'm saying is if i concentrate, i can't be hurt. i can't be injured. because of the little sheet.}
