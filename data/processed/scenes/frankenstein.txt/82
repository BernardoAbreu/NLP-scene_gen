<L>__{ext town square day}
<A>__{...and emerges into the square as angle widens. there's a fair amount of activity. people are still leaving the city, though the earlier flood has thinned. some citizens are still trying to go about their normal lives. vendors are calling out, selling food. the creature moves through the square, unnoticed, just another figure mingling with the flow. people trudge along, eyes downcast, miseries great, paying little attention. the creature pauses, sniffing the air. an aroma draws him to a vendor's stand. loaves of bread are laid out. he hunches down to smell one, picks it up, bites off a chunk. chewing. it's good. a bigger bite. snatching up more.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{here! what do you think you're doing?}
<A>__{the creature glances up. the vendor's wife is within arm's reach, breath catching in her throat at the sight of him. mouth gaping. too stunned to scream. the creature cradles the loaves to his chest, terrified she's going to take them away. he remembers his recent experience with the dogs and decides to try out the lesson he learned: he curls his lips back and snarls. he's rewarded with a piercing shriek. the creature jumps back, startled. this wasn't the desired effect. the woman screams like she'll never stop. he turns to run away... ...and plows right into the stream of refugees. he goes sprawling, scraping his knees bloody, still clutching his loaves. confusion all around. people converge angrily. a rough man grabs his hair, jerking him upright...}
<C>__{rough man}
<D>__{stupid bastard!}
<A>__{...and the creature staggers to his feet before them, whimpering to protect his food, showing his face to all. screams and panic. the creature whips around, seeing horrified faces on all sides... he's the cholera! he's the one been spreadin' the plague! ...faces which turn into an angry mob, glaring sheer hatred. somebody hits him in the face with a heavy stick, spinning him to the ground, loaves of bread scattering. they surround him, hitting, flailing, throwing stones. he tries to crawl, whimpering for them to stop.}
<C>__{vendor's wife}
<D>__{burn him! burn him!}
<A>__{the creature finds himself hoisted into the air, falling back onto a sea of hands, kicking and screaming as the mob sweeps him across the square like some pagan sacrifice. he gets tossed onto the hard cobblestone in a thrashing heap, scrambles to his knees as the crowd surrounds him. he's wailing with terror now, long inhuman howls of fear. men start flinging lamp oil, spattering him, blinding him. a torch is lit, swung toward him. feel the heat. the creature lunges to his feet, panic and terror complete bulldozing through the crowd to get away from the torch, bowling people over, scattering them in all directions. he breaks free, hobbling wildly across the square, greatcoat billowing. the mob streams after him, thirsty for blood, hurling rocks and sticks.}
