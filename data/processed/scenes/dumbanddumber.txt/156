<L>__{interior hearse night}
<A>__{the car is parked in a parking lot across the street from a picturesque bridge. harry and lloyd are shivering in the front seat as a loud, icy wind whips though the hearse. they're each spooning something out of a coffee cup and sipping it.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{any soup left?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{a little. shall we share it?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{lloyd opens a tiny ketchup packet and squirts half of it into harry's cup and the other half into his. they pour a few drops of water in and mix it with their spoons.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{mmmm mmmm good...}
<A>__{lloyd smiles bravely at harry. harry notices something and leans toward him.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{hey, you got something stuck in your front teeth.}
<A>__{lloyd picks a small speck out of his mouth and studies it.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{hmmm... looks like an old piece of beef jerky.}
<A>__{harry stares at it. then:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{wanna split it?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{you're pathetic. get your own.}
<A>__{loyd puts the floss meat back in his mouth and chews it. another gust of wind swirls around them.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm freezing my ass off, lloyd.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{roll up your window.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it is rolled up.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{then i guess the damn anti cold system isn't working. you really should get it fixed if we're gonna live here all winter.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what anti cold system?}
<A>__{lloyd points to the dash.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{right here the a c button. i put it on full blast about an hour ago and, if anything, the car's getting colder.}
<A>__{harry stares at lloyd and then throws down his cup, disgusted. he opens the car door and starts to climb out.}
<C>__{lloyd }
<D>__{what are you going out there for?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{to warm up.}
