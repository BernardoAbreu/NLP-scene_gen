<L>__{interior hector's tent dusk}
<A>__{sadly for hector, the harmonium enthusiast is very close to his shelter. the jangly music is loud and insistent. hector removes six large eggs from a bag and takes them outside to his fire.}
<L>__{exterior camp dusk}
<A>__{andre is there eating the last of his omelette.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{how are they?}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{hector cracks one of his eggs into a copper pan. inside is a brown smudge of dried yoke and some dust. hector grunts in annoyance and cracks another egg. the yoke is discolored and the smell is rank. hector looks at andre, rapidly finishing his omelette before hector can demand it.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{yours were fine?}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{hector picks up a third egg and shakes itclose to his ear. it seems as empty as the other two. he picks up a fourth egg and cracks it open. a small dried up, half formed baby turtle rattles into the pan. andre is quietly enjoying hector's frustration. he stands up to leave.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{good night.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{have you any eggs left?}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{the slaves only got three. i want to ask you something.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you were lucky. what?}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{i want my real name back.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you don't like andre anymore?}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{i think of my home all the time. i want to hear the name they call me. we should die with our real names.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{we're not going to die, andre...}
<A>__{hector smiles at his own insensitivity.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i've forgotten your name...}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{ketabomago pululo.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{now i remember why we called you andre.}
<A>__{andre looks at him expectantly.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i will, andre... i promise... i will call you that... when i remember...}
<A>__{andre is satisfied, and leaves. hector calls to him.}

<C>__{hector}
<D>__{yes... good night...}
<A>__{hector is alone. hector gives up on the eggs and pulls out his store of bread and fruit from the tent. the next source of annoyance is the continuing noise of the}

<A>__{he shouts across to the musical enthusiast, a youth with a few older children by his side.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{hey! stop that, will you? think of the older people, and the sick... i will give you an egg if you stop... here...}
