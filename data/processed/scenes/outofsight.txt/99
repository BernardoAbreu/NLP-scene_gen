<L>__{interior buddy's car day}
<A>__{as buddy pulls away from the house, foley pulls out the clipping of karen he tore out of the morning paper. he's written the name "westin" on it.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{listen, i gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow. why don't you drop me off at the ren cen, we'll hook up later?}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{yeah, and i better call my sister.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<C>__{the snowstorm}
<A>__{it's really coming down. we then pull back to reveal we're looking out of a window inside the cocktail lounge at the top of the westin. a table of three young executive looking guys in suits are laughing at something until karen is ushered by a waitress to an adjacent table.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{jack daniel's, please, water on the side.}
<A>__{she turns, sees her reflection in the glass against the overcast sky, snow swirling, blowing in gusts, seven hundred feet above the city, down there somewhere.}
<C>__{executive guy's voice}
<D>__{celeste, do us again, please, and put the lady's drink on our bill.}
<A>__{she turns to see them raising snifter glasses to her, smiling, pleasant looking guys in dark suits.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{thanks anyway.}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(drifting over)}
<D>__{they want to buy you a drink.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i get that. tell them i'd rather pay for my own.}
<A>__{she then watches the three guys looking at the waitress delivering the message. then they look at karen. she gives them a shrug, turns to watch the snow. her drink arrives. she takes a sip, looks up as one of the guys comes over...}
<C>__{executive guy}
<D>__{excuse me. my associates and i made a bet on what you do for a living.}
<A>__{she glances at the table, the other two watching.}
<C>__{executive guy }
<D>__{and i won. hi, i'm philip.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{if it's okay with you, philip, i'd like to just have a quiet drink and leave. okay?}
<C>__{philip}
<D>__{don't you want to know what i guessed? how i know what you do for a living?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{tell you the truth, i'm not even mildly curious. really, i don't want to be rude, philip, i'd just like to be left alone.}
<A>__{she turns back to the snowstorm. she sees his reflection turn and leave. a moment later, the next one appears at the table.}
<D>__{executive guy #2 i think i know why you're depressed if i may offer an observation.}
<A>__{she just looks at him. so sure of himself.}
<P>__{executive guy #2 (cont'd)}
<D>__{i have a hunch you're the new sales rep and your customer isn't exactly knocked out by the idea of a young lady, even one as stunning as you, handling the account. am i close? hi, i'm andy.}
<A>__{she says nothing to him.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{we're ad guys. we flew in from new york this morning to pitch hiram walker distillery, present this test market campaign for their new margarita mix. what we do, we show this guy who looks like a mexican bandido, you know, with the big chihuahua hat, the bullet belts }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{andy? really. who gives a shit?}
<A>__{he gives her a sympathetic expression.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{want to tell me what happened?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{beat it, will you?}
<A>__{she stares at the guy until he turns away. she sips her drink, stares once more out at the blizzard. after a few moments, another dark suit appears, reflected in the window.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{can i buy you a drink?}
<A>__{boom. not one of the executive guys. she stares at the reflection for a moment, then slowly turns, looks up at jack foley now standing there in his new navy blue suit.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{yeah, i'd love one.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{would you like to sit down?}
<A>__{he pulls the chair out, looking at her. the three guys at the other table now staring as he sits down. foley offers his hand...}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i'm gary.}
<A>__{she hesitates, then shakes his hand...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm celeste.}
<A>__{she smiles with him. when she lowers her hand to the table, his hand comes down to cover hers. she watches his expression as she brings her hand out slowly, his eyes not leaving hers, and lays her hand on his. the tips of her fingers brush his knuckles, lightly back and forth.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{it takes hours to get a drink around here. there's only one waitress.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i can go to the bar.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{don't leave me.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{those guys bother you?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no, they're all right. i meant, you just got here.}
<A>__{she picks up her drink and places it in front of him.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{help yourself.}
<A>__{she watches him take a sip, smack his lips.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{you like bourbon?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{love it.}
<C>__{foley}
<P>__{(passes the glass back)}
<D>__{well, we got that out of the way.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{tell me, celeste. what do you do for a living?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm a sales rep. i came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because i'm a girl.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{is that how you think of yourself?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what, as a sales rep?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{a girl.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i don't have a problem with it.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i like your hair. and that suit.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i had one just like it well, it was the same idea, but i had to get rid of it.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{you did?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{it smelled.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{having it cleaned didn't help, huh?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{what do you do for a living, gary?}
<C>__{foley}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{how far do we go with this?}
<A>__{this stops her, throws her off balance.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{not yet. don't say anything yet. okay?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i don't think it works if we're somebody else. you know what i mean? gary and celeste, jesus, what do they know about anything?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{it's your game. i've never played this before.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{it's not a game. something you play.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{well, does it make sense to you?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{it doesn't have to, it's something that happens. it's like seeing a person you never saw before you could be passing on the street you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition. like you both know something. but then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "what if i had stopped and said something?" it might happen only a few times in your life.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{or once.}
<A>__{they look at each other a moment, then...}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{why don't we get out of here.}
<A>__{they both get up. the ad guys at the table watch as she follows foley to the elevator. karen winks at them.}
