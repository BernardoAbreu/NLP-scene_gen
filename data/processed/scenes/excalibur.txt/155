<A>__{she leads the king, his footsteps ringing in the silent cloister, past the doors to the cells. his armor is wet with dew and it shines with a dull and deep luster. nuns whisper at his transit. she opens the door to a cell and arthur steps inside.}
<L>__{interior cell dawn}
<A>__{candles flicker on a small altar before which a nun is praying. she turns to see who has entered. it is guenevere, older, thin with self denial, all the more beautiful. she looks up at the majestic figure who stands before her. she nearly swoons. he helps her to her feet, and words rush from deep within him.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{guenevere, accept my forgiveness, and put your heart to rest. we have suffered to long. i have always loved you, and i still love you.}
<A>__{she weeps.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{i loved you much, as king, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.}
<C>__{arthur}

<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{i have kept it.}
<A>__{she draws back the covers of her pallet, and there is excalibur. arthur is overwhelmed by emotion; he can barely speak}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i never dared to hope all these years that it was in your keeping.}
<A>__{he kneels before her and kisses her thigh. she gazes off, remembering the life of long ago. he rises and looks off into her eyes, unable to find the words; he finally does.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i have often thought that in the hereafter of our lives, when i owe no more to the future and can be just a man, that we may meet, and you will come to me and claim me as yours, and know that i am your husband. it is a dream i have...}
<A>__{he takes excalibur by the hilt and exits.}
