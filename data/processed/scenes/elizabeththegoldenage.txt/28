<L>__{interior living room, walsingham's house night}
<A>__{william is by the fire, listening to mary playing the virginal and singing. walsingham and ursula are by the dinner table.}
<C>__{ursula}
<D>__{have you spoken to the queen?}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{i speak to her daily.}
<C>__{ursula}
<D>__{you know what i mean. you've done enough. no man could do more.}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{i can't leave court yet. the queen needs me.}
<C>__{ursula}
<D>__{so you're to die in harness like a pack horse, are you? and for what?}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{mary! william!}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{these are difficult times }
<C>__{ursula}
<D>__{it's always difficult times.}
<A>__{mary joins them, her arm in william's. walsingham seizes the opportunity to change the subject.}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{william, come and tell us all the new ideas in the university. will the great breach in the church ever be healed?}
<C>__{william}
<A>__{i doubt it, brother. compromise is out of fashion. on both sides they say there can only be one truth, and one god.}
<C>__{ursula}
<A>__{sit, sit.}
<C>__{mary}
<A>__{here by me, william.}
<C>__{walsingham}
<A>__{what do they say in paris of the pope's call for holy war?}
<C>__{william}
<A>__{many welcome it.}
<C>__{ursula}
<A>__{i don't understand why we must all hate each other.}
<C>__{william}
<A>__{truth will always hate falsehood, ma'am.}
<C>__{mary}
<A>__{why do we have to talk about war? tell us your nice news, william. are you married yet?}
<C>__{william}
<A>__{(smiling) not yet.}
<C>__{mary}
<A>__{then we must find you a nice sensible english wife.}
<C>__{william}
<A>__{no, no. i won't be staying long. i must go back to my studies.}
<C>__{walsingham}
<A>__{not too soon, i hope. every man deserves a rest.}
<C>__{ursula}
<A>__{listen to him! when did you last rest, i'd like to know? (to william) he won't listen to me. not a thought for his health. you tell him, he's your brother. he'll die at his desk, out of sheer selfishness. walsingham shares a rueful smile with william that says, `women, eh?'. they take their seats for dinner.}
