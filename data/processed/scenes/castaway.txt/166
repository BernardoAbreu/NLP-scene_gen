<L>__{exterior lagoon day}
<A>__{defeated and utterly exhausted, chuck swims back from his latest failure. he wades back ashore with the fedex box and throws it on the ground by the palm tree. he has tried so hard to escape, so incredibly hard, done everything humanly possible and beyond. he rips off his life preserver, throws it into the underbrush, then collapses on the beach.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you're too low in the water. too damn low.}
<A>__{chuck's shoulders begin to shake, as he is racked with deep sobs of despair. and then he throws his head back and lets forth, from deep inside himself, a scream of rage and anger and pain. the scream pierces the indifferent natural sounds of the island, the rustling of the breeze, the lulling rhythm of the waves. it is powerful, disturbing, primal. the breeze picks up. behind chuck, the palm trees begin to sway. the tide is reaching up toward the beach. the waves crash louder. the palm trees sway even more. chuck picks up some wet sand and rubs it on his body.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{dust thou art that's for damned sure and unto dust shalt thou return.}
<A>__{a few drops of rain begin to fall, splashing on chuck and sizzling in the fire. chuck looks up: clouds have obscured the sun. the wind blows harder. the rain falls harder, streaking the sand chuck had rubbed on his body. steam sizzles out of the fire. chuck looks up, disbelieving. the bottom falls out of the heavens monsoon rain, more rain than you have ever seen before. a long wave rolls up, its frothy fingers reaching for the fire. forget the raft! forget despair! the fire could go out! this is disaster!}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{he springs into action. chuck grabs an empty fedex box. with his wooden shovel he frantically scoops some coals out of the fire as the rain hisses and pounds at them. he slides the coals into the fedex box, grabs some sticks of driftwood and sets off on a run.}
