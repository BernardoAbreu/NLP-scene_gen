<L>__{interior parking garage}
<A>__{ding ding the elevator bell sounds at the far end of the garage. the doors open. two men in ill fitting suits get out and look around cautiously. the first is tucci, a big bellied, white haired menace. the other is higham, lean and bad skinned. they are bodyguards and give it away by their every careful move. they turn back to the elevator and motion to someone inside. out walks saul berg, a slightly overweight man in his forties with an open collar silk shirt and a thick gold chain on his hairy chest. he carries a large aluminum briefcase. he lets his guards do the worrying. he walks straight to his car. saul passes mcmanus under the hood of the honda. he takes out his keys and pushes a button on his key chain. the mercedes beeps three times and tells saul his alarm is off. tucci keeps an eye on mcmanus. higham watches saul. mcmanus pretends to tinker with the car's engine. he has put a pistol just inside the grill and keeps it within reach. the van on the other side of the garage starts and pulls out of the spot. it cruises over toward the mercedes. tucci sees the van. he and higham are suddenly busy trying to keep track. they hear laughing behind them and turn around. fenster and hockney are walking towards them. they are sporting mustaches and sunglasses in addition to matching suits, each with loud plaid sport coats, decades out of style. saul glances at tucci and higham.}

<D>__{just get in the car saul.}
<A>__{under the hood of the honda and out of sight, mcmanus pulls on a black ski mask. the van gets closer.}
<C>__{hockney}
<D>__{i get out of the car, and man if the thing wasn't wrecked. and i see this broad in the back seat with nothing on.}
<A>__{saul gets in the car quickly but calmly as fenster and hockney laugh and talk louder. they look drunk the desired effect.}
<C>__{hockney }
<D>__{i'm laughing so hard i can't breathe }
<A>__{tucci and higham try to take it all in stride. saul's reverse lights come on and he begins to back out of the spot.}
<C>__{hockney }
<D>__{...and the fat guy comes out of the car with his pants on backwards and says }
<A>__{suddenly, the van revs and screeches to a halt behind saul's mercedes, blocking him in. hockney and fenster drop the drunk act and snap to. they both pull out guns and start screaming.}
<C>__{hockney }
<D>__{don't move, you fuckers.}
<C>__{fenster}
<D>__{right there. freeze.}
<A>__{mcmanus comes up from under the hood. tucci and higham throw their hands in the air. hockney and fenster grab them and reach into their belts to get their guns . keaton jumps out of the van and runs up to saul's car, his face covered in a ski mask. he yanks on the door handle but it is locked. saul sits in terror behind the wheel. keaton pulls out a pistol and smashes the window with it.}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{give me the case.}
<A>__{saul reaches over for the case. keaton trains the gun on him. suddenly, saul comes up with a pistol and points it at keaton. keaton sidesteps and grabs his wrist. the gun goes off into the fender of the honda. hockney and fenster both look over at the sound of the gun. tucci and higham seize the opportunity. tucci grabs hockney, higham grabs fenster. the four men grapple for the guns. fenster's gun falls to the floor. mcmanus picks it up. he trains a pistol on each bodyguard and takes a breath. they are some ten feet apart and moving erratically. hockney and fenster constantly fall in the line of fire. mcmanus walks around the four men, keeping a pistol trained on each of the guards. finally he comes to an angle where they are all in front of him. one guard is a few feet away, the other is ten feet past him. mcmanus' p.o.v. the closer of the two moves in and out of the sights of the pistol in mcmanus' right hand, the one farther away does the same with the left. verbal gets out of the van and moves towards them to help.}
<B>__{boom}
<A>__{both of mcmanus' guns go off like one shot. tucci and higham collapse, each with a bullet in his head}
<B>__{pause}
<A>__{the only sound is saul grappling with keaton for the gun. his arm is halfway out the window. his elbow rests in the door frame. keaton cannot get the gun out of his hand. finally, he pushes down with all his weight. saul's elbow breaks backwards on the door frame. he screams in agony. the gun falls from his hand. all five of the men look at each other for an impossibly long moment. the confusion is only aggravated by saul's screaming. slowly, keaton raises his pistol and aims it at saul. his hand trembles, his eyes squint to near slits. his finger tenses and slacks off over and over again on the trigger.}
<B>__{boom}
<A>__{verbal shoots saul. keaton looks at him in surprise. verbal trembles more than he does. the garage is silent.}
<C>__{hockney}
<D>__{what the hell? mcmanus bad day. fuck it.}
<A>__{ding ding the elevator light comes on. all five men look.}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{move.}
<A>__{keaton reaches into the car and grabs saul's case. everyone else piles into the van. keaton gets in as verbal is driving for the exit.}
