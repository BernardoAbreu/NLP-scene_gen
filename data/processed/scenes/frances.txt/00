<A>__{on an expanse of water, calm and undisturbed. after a moment, it begins to ripple as something rises toward the surface. a girl's face breaks through.}

<D>__{it wasn't a murder. i think god just died of old age. and when i realized he wasn't any more, it didn't shock me. it seemed natural and right.}

<C>__{frances }
<D>__{and yet i began to wonder what the minister meant when he said, 'god, the father, sees even the smallest sparrow fall. he watches over all his children.' that jumbled it all up for me.}
