<A>__{the van slows to a stop in front of the parked cars, all government issue four doors with "ins" stenciled on the sides. seven or eight ins agents stand in front of the cars imposingly. their apparent leader steps forward and comes to the window. the driver rolls it down. agent janus, blonde haired, blue eyed, also government issue, looks at him and sighs.}

<D>__{sure you were. what do you say we have a look at your catch?}
<A>__{at the back of the van, the agents fling open the rear doors, revealing a dozen frightened mexicans, hopeful immigrants without official permission. agent janus looks at the driver, who's now held by two other agents, and shakes his head.}

<A>__{he stops in the middle of his sentence, as another car is approaching, fast, its engine whining as it barrels down the road toward them. several agents pull their weapons. the new car pulls a hard right, goes off the road, spins around the ins cars, and squeals to a sideways halt, silhouetted in front of their headlights. it's a boxy, black 1986 ford ltd. two men get out, dressed in plain black suits, crisp white shirts, simple black ties, shiny black shoes. kay, fiftyish, is the apotheosis of world weary; his partner, dee, mid sixties, is just weary. they approach the ins agents.}

<D>__{what're we thinking, dee?}
<C>__{dee}
<D>__{tough call, kay.}
<A>__{he walks down the row, studying the faces, greeting each one cheerily in spanish.}

<P>__{(it's a pleasure seeing you here.)}
<A>__{one by one, their faces relax, reassured by kay's calm demeanor. when he reaches the fifth guy, he keeps the same cheery tone, but:}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{que dices si te rompo la cara?}
<P>__{(what do you say if i break your face?)}
<A>__{the guy smiles and nods. kay stops. his own smile broadens and he drops a hand on the guy's shoulder.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{no hablas ni una palabra del espanol, verdad, amigo?}

<C>__{kay}
<D>__{don't "sir" me! you have no idea who you're dealing with!}
<A>__{silence on the road. the driver grins, jumps back in the front seat of the van. the others pile into the rear and they tear out of there.}
<C>__{kay }
<P>__{(to janus)}
<D>__{we're gonna have a little chat with our friend here. you boys can hit the road ... and keep on protecting us from dangerous aliens.}
<A>__{kay and dee escort their captive across the road and over a small rise, leaving the stunned ins agents standing alone in the roadway.}
<C>__{agent janus}
<D>__{you ever heard of division 6? 2nd ins agent there is no division 6. 3rd ins agent who are those guys?}
