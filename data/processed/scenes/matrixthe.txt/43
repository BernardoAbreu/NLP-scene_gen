<L>__{interior neo's room}
<A>__{he blinks, regaining consciousness. the room is dark. neo is stretched out on his bed.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i can't go back, can i?}
<A>__{morpheus sitting like a shadow on a chair in the far corner.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{no. but if you could, would you really want to?}
<A>__{neo isn't sure of that answer.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{i feel that i owe you an apology. there is a rule that we do not free a mind once it reaches a certain age. it is dangerous. they have trouble letting go.. their mind turns against them. i've seen it happen. i broke the rule because i had to.}
<A>__{he stares into the darkness, confessing as much to himself as neo.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{when the matrix was first built there was a man born inside that had the ability to change what he wanted, to remake the matrix as he saw fit. it was this man that freed the first of us and taught us the secret of the war; control the matrix and you control the future.}
<A>__{he pauses.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{when he died, the oracle at the temple of zion prophesied his return and envisioned an end to the war and freedom for our people. that is why there are those of us that have spent our entire lives searching the matrix, looking for him.}
<A>__{neo can feel his eyes on him.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{i did what i did, because i believe we have been brought here for a reason, neo. you are here to serve a purpose, just as i am here to serve mine.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i told you i don't believe in fate.}
<A>__{morpheus smiles, leaning towards hin.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{but i do, neo. i do.}
<A>__{he stands up.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{get some rest. you're going to need it.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{your training.}
