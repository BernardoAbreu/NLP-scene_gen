<A>__{as the regulars watch the evening news, in particular the date rape piece which is now in progress. tom anxiously eyeing jane out of the corner of his eye as she watches the monitor. her face impossible to read as she studies the screen.}
<B>__{on monitor}
<C>__{uniformed cop}
<D>__{what can you do? if a woman invites a man in and he says they uh, had sex and she says he raped her and then you find out they've been out together two, three times...how can you prove a crime?}
<B>__{new shot on monitor}
<A>__{tom and a woman of about thirty dignified but fragile she looks like someone who might be cast for a church production of "glass menagerie."}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{it will be a year next month since it happened...i never thought i'd talk about it outside of counseling...}
<B>__{on newsroom}
<A>__{as aaron enters the scene.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{he is shushed by every woman in the room, accepts this and takes up a position near tom and jane to watch them.}
<B>__{on monitor}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{we'd gone out twice and i hadn't enjoyed myself that much but it gets to a point i don't know if you can appreciate this but where you don't want to sit home or be with your girlfriends and people had always been telling me that i was 'too picky.' i'm not. it's just you want to meet a nice guy...so anyways, it was that 'give him a chance' thing. no, it wasn't. i was lonely. so we went to a movie and when he brought me home he said could he just come up and have one beer and then he'd go. how do you say 'no', to that? so first it was this wrestling match which was awful enough because it got to be really a fight...because i'm a modest person... then he ripped my clothes and he forced me to...make love. he stayed in my apartment and forced me more times he didn't leave until...}
<P>__{(she has started to cry)}
<D>__{i promised myself i wouldn't cry... it's just hard not to }
<P>__{(ruefully)}
<D>__{you sure have a sympathetic face.}
<P>__{(she cries a bit more)}
<D>__{...i was so sure i wouldn't do this but the whole thing messed me up maybe more than it should...}
<B>__{on monitor}
<A>__{as the news piece cut to: tom's face he turns clearing a tear from his eyes.}
<B>__{on newsroom}
<A>__{these watching struck perhaps embarrassed but riveted. aaron is aghast. aaron approaches the set.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{can i turn on the news for a second? ...oh, wait a minute. sex tears this must be the news.}
<A>__{tom stares daggers at him as a public official appears on the monitor.}
<B>__{on monitor}
<C>__{public official}
<D>__{i don't think you can overestimate it on any given saturday night tens of thousands of women are being attacked and there isn't much they or we can do about it...}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(on monitor)}
<D>__{the victims often remain too terrified to talk the police powerless and all the social welfare groups can finally do is monitor this epidemic of crime without punishment. this is tom grunick in annandale, virginia.}
<A>__{as his piece concludes.}
<B>__{newsroom}
<A>__{tom continues to glare at aaron.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{i'm in a pissy mood. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what's wrong with it?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{nothing. i think you really blew the lid off nookie.}
<A>__{blair moans with displeasure. aaron exits scene. others start to congratulate tom on the piece in the b.g. on the:}

<A>__{we see frozen wilderness men digging in the ground clumps of people watching them work.}

<D>__{nice work...}
<P>__{(checks watch)}
<D>__{i've got to get a crew off the clock.}

<B>__{on tom and jane}
<A>__{now off a bit by themselves.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{so what did you think?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{it moved me. i did relate to it i really did. it was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and i think a lot of the time i'm too conservative about that kind of stuff. okay?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(enormously pleased)}
<D>__{yeah.}
