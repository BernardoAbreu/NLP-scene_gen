<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{what do they see in you?}
<A>__{finally, easy spots a fifty year old man in an old grey tweed jacket sitting in a corner at a table by himself. looking like the god fearing, all fearing baptist deacon that he is he is as out of place as a whore in church as he nervously gazes about the room and massacres a plate of barbecued ribs. easy leans over the counter to the bartender.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{hey, lewis. gimme a couple glasses and a pail of ice and send a quart of bourbon over there to odell's table.}

<C>__{easy}
<D>__{i'm a sorry man, all right. any man without his paycheck is sorry.}
<A>__{dupree laughs, smacking the table so hard it rattles like an earthquake. and coretta's smile ignites like a slow fuse causing easy to feel it all the way down his spine. a man with his hair marcelled back swoops in and pulls a quart of old crow from his overcoat and sits it on the table. easy reaches for his wallet but dupree beats him to it.}
<C>__{dupree}
<D>__{i got it, easy. your money ain't no good up in here.}

<A>__{odell shakes his head "no," and coretta looks away as if insulted leaving silence until}
<C>__{dupree}
<D>__{hey, coretta got a new job at the phone company.}
<A>__{he squeezes his woman in close and coretta softens up and burns that smile again. easy grins and nods "congratulations."}
<B>__{the bottle}
<A>__{it's less than a quarter full now because it's three hours later.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{john's is only half full and the band is gone. the jukebox echoes lena horne's "prisoner of love" and dupree leans back in his chair, snoring mouth wide open. odell gets up and starts to amble off.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{hey, you goin' home, odell?}
<A>__{concentrating totally on keeping his balance, odell waves feebly without looking back. easy is droopy eyed from the booze but coretta just looks a little sexier. she straightens dupree's hat on his head and twists up her nose.}
<C>__{coretta}
<D>__{he used to play till the cock crowed. but that ole cock don't crow nearly so much now...}
<A>__{she levels her perpetual "come on" onto easy and he nods sluggishly and lifts himself to his feet.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{think i'm gonna head out.}
<C>__{coretta}
<D>__{you be sorry if you go.}
<A>__{she slides her hand inside her blouse and discreetly lifts her bodice to air her breasts.}

<C>__{coretta}
<D>__{daphne sleep by now. you can't get none of that tonight.}
