<L>__{interior living room day}
<A>__{georges and eva's husband, geoff, around fifty. he speaks with a british accent.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{... three times a week... i'm not experienced enough. we'll see if that's enough.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{how much is she asking?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{it's paid by the hour. we'll see.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{and her?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{anne?}
<A>__{geoff nods. georges shrugs.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{it's hard to say. sometimes i get the feeling she's totally unaware of the state she's in. and then i feel the opposite. it's... i don't know.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{and what about the doctor? what does he say?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{he's...}
<A>__{eva comes in through the door. she's in floods of tears.}
<C>__{eva}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{she only talks gibberish. i don't know what...}
<A>__{geoff gets up, hesitantly.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{hey, dear...}
<A>__{he goes toward her and leads her to the armchair where he was sitting.}
<C>__{geoff }
<D>__{...come here, sit down, it's ok.}
<A>__{she shakes him off, irritated, and sits down.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{nothing is ok.}
<A>__{at first he's vexed by her brusque response, but then goes to sit down on the sofa. meanwhile, eva turns to georges:}
<C>__{eva }
<D>__{what's going on, actually? you can't just leave her lying on her bed like that! she's unrecognizable! it's ridiculous!}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{we can't do anything for the moment. calm down, darling. she's getting medical treatment, they give her the necessary medication, and there are no other options right now.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{what does that mean, "no other options"? why isn't she in a hospital?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{she had a second stroke. bertier examined her and felt we could spare her all the hospital inpatient procedures.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{anyway, they wouldn't keep her, they'd send her to a care home. what they do in those places, we can do here.}
<A>__{eva looks at him, amazed.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{and she won't be put in a care home. i promised her that.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{don't you think you're taking on too much?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{have you got a better idea?}
<A>__{geoff doesn't know what to say. eva has composed herself somewhat and blows her nose.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{i can't believe that these days there's no way of handling this efficiently.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(curtly)}
<D>__{no one's stopping you from finding out.}
<A>__{eva gets up, furious, and goes to the window. georges follows her with his eyes.}
<C>__{georges }
<P>__{(peaceably)}
<D>__{believe me, i love your mother as much as you do. so please, don't treat me as if i was a total idiot incapable of doing the obvious.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{i didn't say that. i'm simply questioning whether what i see going on here is the answer to everything!}
<C>__{geoff}
<P>__{(to georges)}
<D>__{don't you want to get a second opinion?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{now you two had better stop, ok? another doctor did come. he said bertier was right. from monday, a nurse will come three times a week. now can we talk about something else?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{like what?}
