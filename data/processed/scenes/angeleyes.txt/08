<L>__{exterior video game room day}
<A>__{this is the call sharon and robby have sped to. it is a chaotic scene of cops breaking up a fight between eight boys, 16 20. a big kid, 18 or so, is being pulled off another by sharon and robby. the kid is wild and resisting and sharon shows her toughness and professionalism and some anger, too, as she slams him into a fence and robby holds him while she cuffs the young man who is very mouthy, playing to his friends.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{look at this bitch. whoo! benny, look at this!}
<A>__{sharon and robby are both very good at their jobs, taking this kid to their car while other cops contain the rest. a crowd watches mostly teens.}
<C>__{kid}
<P>__{(to sharon)}
<D>__{you come in with me. hey, bitch.}
<A>__{some of his bystanders friends howl at that.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{you're going to arrest me, you come into the back seat with me. come on!}
<A>__{he resists a bit, but they're getting him into the car.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{come on. we'll have a good time.}
