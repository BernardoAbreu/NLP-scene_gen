<L>__{interior orona's den day}
<A>__{the door is unlocked and swings open easily to reveal lowrey and burnett in an instant, repulsed reaction to orona's body which sits upright in his office chair, the body grotesque and bloated.}
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{now what?}
<A>__{a sickened burnett goes over to the body, speaking to orona as if he were alive.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{where are the drugs?}
<P>__{(no answer)}
<D>__{where... are... the... drugs?}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{he ain't sayin' nothin'. he must be guilty of somethin'.}
<A>__{meanwhile, lowrey's got no problem with the dead body. he tries opening a desk drawer, but orona's rigor mortis stiffened knee is in the way. so lowrey gives it a shove and the chair swivels. orona's dead arm sweeps the lamp off the desk.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{whoa. watch where you're swinging them dead arms, orona. you're gonna fuck up your own crime scene.}
<A>__{lowrey braves the body and gingerly pokes around his pockets.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{watch what you touch. that's evidence.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{not touching. browsing... mr. orona. you've got the right to remain silent. anything you say'll surprise the shit out of us.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{anything?}
<C>__{lowrey}
<P>__{(finds small notepad)}
<D>__{jai alai. dog track. lotta bookies. phone numbers.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{lemme guess. guy does the air conditioning contract for the p.d. he'd have the plans.}
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{he trades the plans for his paper and gets popped by the perps.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{works for me. now can we go? i'm gonna puke.}
