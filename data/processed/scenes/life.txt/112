<L>__{exterior camp 8 yard day}
<A>__{on the porch, willie, now in his 70s, sits in a wheelchair watching the ball game on a black and white television. a trusty waits nearby. ray, now in his mid 60s, emerges from the bunkhouse lugging a duffle bag.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{alright willie, i think i got everything. i will talk to dillard, see if i can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. make sure they're changing your diapers regular.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{they'll be sending you up there soon enough. and not just for a visit, neither.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(leaning in)}
<D>__{i slipped in a couple of bottles of my latest batch. help wash down all them pills they'll be giving you.}
<A>__{he gives willie a slap on the back and nods to the trusty. the trusty wheels the old man across the yard where young prisoners mingle with wives and family members sporting the fashions of the early '70s afros, mutton chops, paisley prints and bell bottom pants.}
<B>__{across the yard}
<A>__{looking old style, claude sits on the mess hall steps waiting for sylvia. he catches willie's eye. the two men nod to each other, an unspoken farewell. then claude turns to find ray looking at him from the bunkhouse steps. ray and claude hold each others gaze for a moment. then ray heads back into the bunkhouse.}

<P>__{(off)}

<A>__{claude takes this in, staring off into space.}
<C>__{yvette}
<D>__{she always said that if you were on the outside...}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{but i'm not on the outside. i'm in here.}
<C>__{yvette}
<D>__{i know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{take care of me?}
<C>__{yvette}
<D>__{you know, go to the tonk or whatever.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i'm too old for you. besides, i'm not much in the mood.}

<D>__{want me to come back some other time?}
<C>__{claude}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. but if you talk to sylvia, tell her old claude said congratulations.}
