<A>__{the blood trail leads down a gloomy stairwell. the game is just audible overhead. lincoln stumbles down the steps, clutching his bleeding arm. between pain and concussion, he loses his footing and falls. he tumbles down the remaining steps to the bottom. i n the gloom we see groundskeeping e q u i p m e n t , supplies edgers, aerators, spray rigs, drums of insecticides, herbicides. for a moment, lincoln lies stunned. then hears a noise and rolls over. he looks up the stairwell. a shadow is descending towards him. w i t h painful effort, lincoln starts crawling across the floor, eyes fixed on the shadow. tensing as a handgun noses out of the darkness. then a stadium security guard steps into the light }

<A>__{lincoln holds his gaze, looking deep in his eyes. then, as if scared by what he sees there, starts inching away, glancing at the guard's body smoldering lowering, melting through the drum scheer moving forward, the smile leaving his face. a mask of hollowness as he moves in on his quarry, the syringe gun poised. lincoln stumbling collapsing to his knees hanging his head as if in surrender... then suddenly his hand flies up boom a flash of light as he fires the handgun recovered from the ground an energy pulse impacting the wall, fizzling out scheer keeps coming, syringe gun ready, blank faced, unflinching the guard's body crackling into flame the drum splitting open boom another flash lincoln fires again clipping his enemy scheer keeps coming, a charred wound in his shoulder, relentless the guard's body burning sliding into the sands of herbicide boom boom boom lincoln keeps firing more hits than misses scheer keeps coming, blank faced, his body pitting with impacts a blinding flare of light the herbicide igniting the drum exploding starting a chain reaction other drums igniting exploding fire smoke engulfing all in a blazing inferno...}
