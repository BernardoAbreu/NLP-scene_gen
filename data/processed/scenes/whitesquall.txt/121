<A>__{chuck feels the ship coming down on top of him but still finds robin's arm. they clasp tightly, but chuck just can't budge the door. then, strangely, robin releases chuck's arm and pulls it back through the door. chuck looks up, startled. the small round window in the door is illuminated from the cabin lights on the inside. through the glass, chuck meets robin's frightened eyes. he fights to stay in a shrinking air pocket. robin takes a last gulp of air then, a calm comes over him. he meets chuck's eyes again but this time with a strange acceptance. they both know what's happening. but robin has refused to take his friend to the bottom with him. he presses his hand to the glass. chuck does the same. then with a smile, robin pushes himself away from the door, disappearing into the darkness and eternity.}
