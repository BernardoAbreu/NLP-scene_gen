<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior daitz' office later night}
<A>__{a tiny, cramped hovel. books, papers, and all of it jammed to overflowing. mackelway sits across from o'ryan...}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<P>__{(as "daitz:")}
<D>__{...the name of this theory was "suspect zero."}
<P>__{(mackelway nods)}
<D>__{the idea of suspect zero posits that if a serial killer were diabolical enough, he could traverse the country without ever being caught, killing randomly.}
<A>__{there's a collection here in a glass case: ancient weapons crude knives, swords, blow darts. mackelway notes them.}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{tell me, what makes a killer catchable?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{patterns, repetition of behavior.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{now imagine a killer with no patterns, no tell tale fetishes, no rituals, no hidden desire to be caught. a perfect vessel of evil, killing without ever leaving a single meaningful clue in his wake... he'd be immune to capture, wouldn't he? your task forces, your forensics teams they'd be helpless.}
<A>__{mackelway looks over daitz' bookshelf: volume after volume about evil, the devil, the minds of sociopaths, the history of serial killers, ritual killers, tribal rites...}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{is that something you believe in, professor? evil?}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{as a citizen of the world, it's hard not to. wouldn't you say?}
<P>__{(mackelway can't argue)}
<D>__{evil is all around us, i think a part of the natural order of things. like gravity. like wind. a vast black wave, corrupting everything it touches. a virus invades a cell, causing it to dysfunction. perfectly logical. but did it ever occur to you that something may have invaded that virus, something capable of using it to mutate so powerfully?}
<A>__{mackelway pauses, considering that.}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{just because something's invisible to us doesn't mean it doesn't exist.}
<A>__{mackelway is silent: something's off here. but he can't say for sure just yet what it is...}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{have you ever seen a fifty foot shark?}
<A>__{that wasn't just the echo of a question he's heard before; it was a red flag. a big one. mackelway tightens.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{i'm sorry?}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{a shark, as we know, will only attack humans if he runs out of food. but biologists have theorized that for a shark of fifty feet the ocean would be an endless buffet. he'd never run out of food, so he'd have no need to come to the surface. consequently, we would never see him. do you follow?}
<P>__{(mackelway doesn't)}
<D>__{we'll never see one. but that doesn't mean they don't exist. hence suspect zero.}
<A>__{mackelway eyes those books on evil, then those ancient weapons... casually, almost imperceptibly, he reaches for his sidearm, as o'ryan continues:}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{some of my colleagues think i'm fascinated with evil. i think the truth is just the opposite: evil is fascinated with us. what better vehicle could there be for creating havoc in the world what better instrument than man? we're vain, we're stubborn, we're deceitful, we have an imagination that is limitless in its perversions. of course evil keeps trying to harness us. wouldn't you?}
<A>__{the more he talks, the closer mackelway comes to extracting that gun... then, disturbing the silence, a knock at the door.}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{o'ryan rises, goes to the door... as mackelway unholsters his gun. o'ryan opens the door. standing here is a coed, with a backpack. she looks confused.}
<C>__{coed}
<D>__{oh. i'm sorry. i was looking for professor }
<A>__{just like that, o'ryan has bolted past the coed, literally tossing her onto mackelway, exploding into the hall. she screams. mackelway grabs her, moves her aside as gently as time allows, then blows out of the room...}
