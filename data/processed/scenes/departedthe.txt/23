<L>__{interior corridor police building. day}
<A>__{colin, in his good suit, moves along the hall. he owns the building. he looks into offices. he is looking at his future. from one room barrigan (still working in uniform) gives him the thumbs up. colin gets a coffee. he looks at a secretary's ass. caught at it, he smiles beautifully. she smiles back.}

<D>__{siu. what a country.}
<C>__{barrigan}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{perfect.}
<A>__{meaning to some extent "perfect for a dick like you". this is how friends come apart. barrigan is unable to continue his pose of congratulation. colin (close on colin) is on to him.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{i don't mind going it alone. if you could go it alone you might get somewhere yourself.}
<C>__{barrigan}
<D>__{we're cops. this isn't "somewhere".}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{i know you're a worker. i might be able to do something for you. you got any suits at home or you like coming to work looking like you're gonna invade poland.}
