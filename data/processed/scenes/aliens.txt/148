<A>__{as she awakens with a start. she checks her watch... an hour has passed. she gently disengages herself from newt and is about to crawl out from beneath the cot when she sees something and freezes. across the room, just inside the door to the med lab, are two innocuous but nonetheless chilling objects. two stasis cylinders. their tops are hinged open, and the suspension fields are switched off. they are both empty. ripley feels a slow upwelling wave of terror rise through her in that silent frozen moment...the inescapable certainty of a lethal presence. unable to move or breathe, she looks around frantically, assessing the situation.}

<D>__{sssh. don't move. we're in trouble.}
<A>__{newt nods, now wide awake. they listen in the darkness for the slightest betrayal of movement. the scrabble of multiple legs across the polished floor, for example. there is only the droning hum of the little space heater. ripley reaches up and, clutching the springs of the underside of the cot, begins to inch it away from the wall. the squeal of metal as the legs scrape across the floor is jarringly loud in the stillness. when the space is wide enough she cautiously slides herself up between the wall and the edge of the cot, reaching for the rifle she left lying on top of the mattress. here yes clear the edge of the bed. the rifle is gone. she snaps her head around. a scuttling shape leaps toward her from the foot of the bed! she ducks with a startled cry. the obscene thing hits the wall above her, legs moving lightning fast. reflexively she slams the bed against the wall, pinning the creature inches above her face. its legs and tail writhe with incredible ferocity and it emits a demented, piercing}

<A>__{ripley heaves newt across the polished floor and in a frenzied scramble rolls from beneath the cot. she flips it over, trapping the creature underneath. they back away, gasping. ripley's eyes flash around the shadowed room where every corner of space between equipment holds lethal promise. the creature scuttles from beneath the bed and disappears under a back of cabinets in a blur. ripley hugs newt close and heads toward the door, moving as if every object in the room had a million volts running through it. she reaches the door. hits the wall switch. nothing happens. disabled from outside. she tries the lights. nothing. she pounds on the door. the acoustically dampened door panel thunks dully. she moves to the observation window, glancing frantically over her shoulder. the bare floor behind her is like a screaming threat.}

<D>__{hey...hey!}
<A>__{she pounds on the window. through the double thickness window we can see that the lab is dark and empty. ripley whirls, hearing a loathsome scrabbling behind her. newt starts to whimper, feeding off her fear. she steps in front of the video surveillance camera and waves her arms in a circle.}
