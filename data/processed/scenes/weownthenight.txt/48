<L>__{interior bobby's apartment living room night}
<A>__{smoke and drink everywhere. madonna's "dress you up" plays in the background. crowded. bobby, rosario, and louis are at the center of a poker game. lou sits next to bobby, partnering with him in the game and whispering into his ear from time to time. rosario sits next to bobby and watches the game intently. the poker pot seems exceptionally large. a stocky latino man is the main one competing with bobby. bobby's a mess, maybe worse than we've yet seen him. but he is happily drunk, his eyes bloodshot. he and louis look at their cards. rosario turns, looks at bobby for a beat. she sees a small bruise he's got on his forehead, kisses it.}
<C>__{rosario diaz}
<D>__{baby, you got a little bruise here }
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{that ain't nothing.}
<A>__{he starts rubbing her between the legs, under the table. she kisses his bruise again. louis pokes her. smiling and pointing to his crotch:}
<C>__{louis falsetti}
<D>__{i got a bruise too, you know right here!}
<A>__{rosario lets out a loud laugh. louis whispers pearls of wisdom to bobby:}
<C>__{louis falsetti }
<D>__{so bob, i think we fold.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we fold, right?}
<A>__{bobby ignores him. instead, aloud, to the latino man:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{we'll see you and bump you two c's.}
<C>__{louis falsetti}
<P>__{(whispered too loud)}
<D>__{we will?}
<A>__{bobby turns to him, winks. the phone is ringing. a lot. rosario gets up, walks over to the phone near the sofa and picks up with a soft "hello". meanwhile, bobby puts a whole lot of cash in the middle. the latino man looks at him like he's crazy. finally:}
<C>__{stocky latino man}
<D>__{call.}
<A>__{bobby takes a shot of liquor. turns over his cards. he has a pair of queens:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{siegfried and roy, baby! two fucking queens!}
<C>__{stocky latino man}
<D>__{goddamnit!}
<A>__{a pair of tens. bobby stands, claps once. lou, thrilled, jumps up and hugs bobby.}
<C>__{louis falsetti}
<D>__{bobkes, i love you!}
<A>__{rosario has a slightly serious look on her face as she calls out to bobby:}
<C>__{rosario diaz}
<D>__{bobby it's for you!}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{who is it?}
<A>__{she shakes her head as if to say, "i don't know." slightly peeved that he needs to attend to the call, he leaves the table. as he does so, louis, to some girl, proudly:}
<C>__{louis falsetti}
<D>__{i was the one told him to keep goin'!}
<A>__{then louis grabs the pot for himself as bobby picks up the phone, several feet away from the ruckus. he covers his free ear with his hand to hear better:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{michael solo }
<D>__{bobby, it's michael solo i got some bad news.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{your brother's been shot. he's at st. john's they're workin' on him now. i just thought you should know.}
<A>__{bobby, of course, is stunned. the poker table in the background is a riot, a contrast to the sober message bobby's getting. he turns his back to the crowd; sotto:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{is is he gonna be all right?}
<C>__{michael solo}
<D>__{listen, your father's coming i gotta go. but he's at st. john's.}
<A>__{hang up. bobby waits a beat, frozen, then does the same. rosario knows something is wrong, approaches him.}
<C>__{rosario diaz}
<D>__{bobby?}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{my brother was shot...they're operating on him now.}
<A>__{rosario sees how remote he is, what a blow it is. she pulls him to her:}
<C>__{rosario diaz}
<D>__{you gotta go see him be there for him and your father.}
<A>__{bobby eyes her, walks to the table. a close shot on him.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{game's over, everybody.}
<C>__{stocky latino man}
<D>__{what, you shuttin' it down?!?}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{that's right. i gotta go.}
<C>__{louis falsetti}
<D>__{bobkes ? what's wrong?}
<C>__{stocky latino man}
<D>__{fuck you, man! we're in deep here!}
<A>__{bobby grabs his coat. rosario responds in kind, moves to bobby. he spins to her. in hushed tones:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{what're you doing?}
<C>__{rosario diaz}
<D>__{i wanna come too. for you }
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{no it's gonna be a fuckin' scene. i will call you later.}
<C>__{rosario diaz}
<D>__{bobby }
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{don't argue.}
<A>__{bobby moves to louis:}
<C>__{bobby green }
<D>__{louis, lock up and take her home.}
<C>__{louis falsetti}
<P>__{(confused, he nods)}
<D>__{sure, bob. everything cool?}
<A>__{hurt, rosario spins around and enters bobby's room, closing the door behind her.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{yeah, no i just remembered i gotta do something, that's all }
<A>__{pats louis' arm as if to reassure him. then the latino man tries to grab some of the pot. other players revolt:}
<C>__{other players}
<D>__{hey hey! what the fuck?!?}
<A>__{a fight breaks out. louis moves over to the women, holding them back (odd they weren't going anywhere to begin with):}
<C>__{louis falsetti}
<D>__{take it easy, take it easy! calm down and everything'll be, uh, non compos mentis!}
<A>__{pushing, shoving. punching. bobby exits his place, leaving behind rosario and louis and chaos...}
