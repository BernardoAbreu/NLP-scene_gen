<A>__{very abruptly, he comes alive on the phone. a real laughing boy.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(effusively)}
<D>__{sidney, joe. how do you like it? i'm running out of alibis! no, i asked hunsecker to withhold the item, until he could give it a fine, fat paragraph. the column was running over and i didn't want you kissed off with just a line...}
