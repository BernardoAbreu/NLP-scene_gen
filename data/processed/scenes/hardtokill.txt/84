<A>__{storm has found a zabutone meditation pillow and is sitting on his knees in formal japanese posture with black dugi pants and no shirt. he unravels a package with oriental characters handwritten on the outside. in one section: what looks like an old wax baggie full of chinese herbs. in the other, storm unfolds a pouch containing an assortment of needles: long, short, skinny, fat. storm fingers the needles and finds a spot in his shoulder with very bad scar tissue and quickly and coldly sticks it in deep. he then twirls and adjusts it. it is apparent that he knows what he's doing. we stay close on the needles, noting the amount in the package has greatly diminished. pull up to reveal storm, with at least 50 needles sticking out of him. he is now frozen deep in meditation. camera circles around him 360 degrees he is like a japanese statue.}
<B>__{montage with score.}
<A>__{a) interior armstead gym night an impressive home facility with floor to ceiling mirrors, nautilus equipment, etc. storm ignores the machines and tentatively selects from an old set of weights, hefting them to test his own strength, then begins a slow workout. b) exterior armstead yard day storm performs a series of eastern exercises: stick, aikido, and meditation. he's obviously pushing himself beyond exhaustion; andy watches, growing more and more concerned.}

<D>__{that's enough! i don't care how many needles you stick in yourself or how much ginseng root you eat ... you have to sleep if you're going to recover.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{i slept for seven years?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{that's an order!}
<A>__{storm, dripping sweat, glowers at her for a long beat, then... relents. she snatches the stick from his hand, hauls him toward the house.}

<D>__{jesus what a patient!}
<A>__{c) exterior fire road day storm tries to run up a dirt hill. he's still too weak struggles, sweating, straining with fierce determination. d) interior armstead gym night storm at the "sticking point" in a scott bench curl. his biceps bulge, veins pop as he strains with all his strength. he ... can't ... quite then: he makes it! exhausted. lets the bar crash metal to metal"' into its cradle. e) exterior armstead pool day storm swims, slowly gaining power. f) exterior wooded clearing (armstead's) day storm with two long pieces of cut oak. as andy watches, he lays them side by side on the ground and begins to dig a deep narrow hole. he tests the hole for depth. when it's deep enough, he places the boards down into the hole and begins to fill it in, packing the earth tightly. he goes to the top of the boards and around them wraps a length of old hemp rope. around and around. the boards stand up about six feet high. storm steps back, observes the height, taps it lightly testing the recoil tension. now he begins to punch it, harder and harder. over and over again. andy, preparing his lunch, can't keep her eyes off him. she is awed by his fire and perseverance. g) exterior armstead pool day andy and storm churn up the water in a splashy race. she wins but not by much. she smiles. he doesn't. she splashes water on him, but he's not in a playful mood. end montage. music down }
