<L>__{interior plane at the hatch later}
<A>__{chipchipchip! ice is flying. things are desperate as a single flashlight beam propped up on a crate, illuminates carrie, delfy and pryce hard at it frantically chopping away at the ice filled hatch with pieces of scrap metal from the plane. efforts are big but the progress minimal.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{this isn't going to work, it's like digging through concrete with a spoon.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we're going to suffocate before we get out here.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{how long do you figure we've got?}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{three of us down here 12, 15 hours at the most.}
<A>__{delfy looks at him with the intensity of a trapped animal.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{no way. i'm not going out like this. no way.}
<A>__{the light from the flashlight slowly begins to fade. carrie goes over to the crate, slaps it against her leg, trying to get more juice going. still fading. light goes out screen goes black. can't see a thing. a second later, another light kicks on pryce is holding it. hands it over to carrie }
<C>__{delfy }
<D>__{and when that one goes we're screwed.}
<A>__{carries mind whirls with her lack of options, then }
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{what about the vodka we could make some torches, maybe melt the ice?}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{fire will burn the o2 quicker.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{what choice do we have?}
<A>__{pryce knows she's right. delfy looks to them both. desperate.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{don't need my vote.}
<A>__{pryce heads to the back, his body becoming barely visible in the dissipating range of light. carrie takes a six inch, pearl handled buck knife from a pocket, unfolds it starts cutting the liner of her coat. delfy moves to a nearby wooden crate. goes to lift it, but it's frozen to the floor. stomps on it. it breaks. pulls pieces from the siding for torch sticks. pryce comes back with a couple bottles. stops dead in his tracks. carrie looks over to see him staring at two life jackets attached to the wall near the hatch. he's thinking. he moves to carrie }
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{hold these.}
<A>__{he exchanges the bottles for her flashlight. he shines the light to the ceiling as he heads toward the back, leaving carrie and delfy getting swallowed in the dark.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{what're you doing?}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{all these planes used to have bail out hatches.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{we came in through it.}
<A>__{pryce goes back into the cargo area.}
<C>__{pryce }
<D>__{has to be more than one.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{it'd be on the ceiling in case of an ocean landing.}
<A>__{carrie watches pryce's flashlight moving about in the cargo area of the aircraft.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{found it!}
<A>__{carrie and delfy get to pryce. they follow his beam straight up to expose an escape hatch in the roof of the fuselage.}
<C>__{pryce }
<D>__{with the angle of the plane, i don't think we're that far from the surface. give me a hand.}
<A>__{pryce moves to a large crate starts to push it over. they join, sliding it over below the hatch. he jumps up onto it examines the hatch area.}
<C>__{pryce }
<D>__{these are explosive bolts. if we blow the hatch, maybe it'll smash a hole up through the ice.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{or, if the ice is too thick the blast will come right back at us.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{we can be blown up, suffocate or freeze to death. take your pick.}
<A>__{pryce hands carrie the flashlight. she targets the hatch area as he opens an electrical panel beside it; a crisscrossing maze of wires. as he reaches up to examine the wiring, carrie catches a glimpse of a shoulder harness under his liner.}
<C>__{pryce }
<D>__{this could work give me the battery from your phone.}
<A>__{as he looks down, carrie masks her discovery. hands over her phone. he extracts the battery.}
<C>__{pryce }
<D>__{when i connect these two wires, hopefully there's going to be a big bang. may want to take some cover.}
<A>__{pryce is nervous himself as he places one selected wire onto the battery, and prepares for another. he looks to carrie and pryce who have backed up against the fuselage.}
<C>__{pryce }
<D>__{you guys ready?}
<A>__{delfy nods. carrie is still running that shoulder holster through her head. pryce touches the last wire to the battery. nothing happens. hope freezes. pryce tries again ka boom! the hatch explodes inward, ricocheting around the inside of the cargo hold like a giant bullet coming in and out of their light. slam, slam, slam, until...wham, it buries itself edge on, halfway into the fuselage, missing carrie by a hair's width. they stand there, deafened and stunned, then a shower of ice rains into the plane where the hatch used to be and a thin shaft of light drops into the cargo bay like a gift from god.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{hallelujah }
<A>__{pryce drops down. moves to another crate.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{delfy, help me with this. we'll need to get up higher.}
<A>__{delfy moves forward to help. the two of them push it over. it's a strenuous lift to get it on top of the other. just as they finish, pryce turns to find himself facing carrie holding one of the russian's guns to his face.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{don't move.}
<A>__{pryce stares at her in disbelief.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{yeah what're you doing?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{our friend here isn't who he says he is.}
<A>__{she reaches into pryce's liner, pulls out his sidearm from the shoulder holster. switches it with the one in her hand. puts the russian gun in her coat pocket.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{didn't you know it's a direct treaty violation to carry a firearm down here?}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{i've been authorized because of what's happened.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{stop lying to me }
<A>__{she takes out her handcuffs.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{delfy, cuff him to the wall.}
<A>__{she holds out the cuffs.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{don't do this.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{man, the guy just saved our lives...}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{he was saving his own. do it.}
<A>__{delfy takes the cuffs from her. cuffs pryce to some exposed piping. carrie lowers her gun.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{you know what was in that safe.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now, who are you?}
<A>__{she sees a moment of contemplation on pryce's face }
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{i swear i will leave you here to die.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{cia.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{have you got an id for that too?}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{listen to me forty eight hours ago, we picked up chatter between someone down here and tahir soufian, a black market trader in new york. it was all about setting up a buy for cannisters found in an old russian transport buried in the ice.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{damn, i knew that government eavesdropping was true.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{there's been rumors for years that the russians had a second base a secret weapons research facility under the ice that supposedly blew up in the late sixties nothing was ever confirmed.}
<C>__{pryce }
<D>__{the fact is, before the treaty in `72 they were strip mining all over the place down here we believe for uranium and other specialized minerals for weapon's use. it was the cold war. no one knows half the things the russian's were up to. this plane could be the link between rumor and truth. and if it is true, what's in those cannisters could be a prelude to another terrorist attack.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{why did you lie to me?}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{look, the u.n. carries a lot of weight down here. think about it if i had told you i was c.i.a., you would have been on the horn back to washington in no time. this is a very sensitive matter. news travels fast down here, i don't have to tell you that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{besides, i didn't know if i could trust you.}
<A>__{carrie wrestles with her emotions. she looks back towards the open safe, the blood staining the airplane floor. makes a decision.}
