<B>__{autumn in new york}
<A>__{screenplay by allison burnett shooting draft}
<L>__{2000}
<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior central park september afternoon}
<A>__{a couple moves down a walkway, deep in subdued conversation. all around them trees explode with autumn color. birds sing. their path is dappled with leafy shadow. to their left, on the sunny meadow, teenagers throw saucers and footballs, smoke cigarettes and joints, drink beer and soda, savoring the waning hours of summer.}
<B>__{closer on the couple}
<A>__{he is wills keane, late 40's to early 50's, strikingly handsome, impeccably dressed, and supremely poised. at first glance he has the proud glow of a hedonist who in the war against time has been the undisputed victor. only a closer look hints at the toll of battle. his shoulders strain under the weight of so much repetition. his eyes are touched by regret. the lines in his face reveal an emerging disenchantment not so much with the world as with himself. walking at his side is a woman, 30, attractive and bright. her name is unimportant because so many have come before her and, if the past prevails, so many will come after. she listens intently, as wills finishes speaking }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{ and i could have waited to tell you, but i wanted to leave no room for misunderstanding.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{well, you certainly didn't.}
<L>__{exterior another central park walkway later}
<A>__{still talking quietly, they pass into a more secluded area of the park }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{no, i see how you could feel this way. of course i do. it's human. but what i don't get is why you'd want to announce it so quickly. i mean, we just met. feelings change. you don't even know me.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{yes, i do.}
<A>__{she is amused by his confidence }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{oh, really?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{the minute i laid eyes on you. it's the saddest thing about getting older. you know people so quickly. i even knew you'd end up hating me.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{well, you're wrong. i don't.}
<C>__{wills}
<P>__{(with a weary smile)}
<D>__{give it time.}
<A>__{she laughs. then he stops. he hears something. she stops. she hears it, too. it's a girl's voice. he casually turns and looks, squinting into the sun. he takes a few steps and there, between trees, he sees two dozen people sitting on the grass and on folding chairs most are middle aged or older with a distinctly intellectual bohemian look to them. standing and addressing them is charlotte fielding, 19, fair, willowy, pale, lovely in an unconventional way. she wears an eccentric hat and a vintage dress. her bearing is upright, her gaze warm and intelligent, her voice rich with emotion }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{ and for weeks i sat by her bed and cried. i told her i loved her and i begged her not to leave me. all i could think about was what i'd lose if she died. and then one night... she was in really bad pain... i stopped thinking about myself for a second and i thought about her.}
<P>__{(fighting tears)}
<D>__{i stopped crying. i said goodbye. and in less than an hour ella was gone.}
<A>__{the woman whispers in wills' ear }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{it's so sad.}
<A>__{but wills ignores her. he watches charlotte with keen interest, touched by the depth and sincerity of her emotion.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i really think it's possible to hold a person back... cry them back... from dying. that's what i did to ella and i will never do it to anyone else again.}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i hope no one ever does it to me.}
<A>__{she looks out at the group, many of whom are crying. a tear runs down her cheek. she smiles and wipes it away. the woman, seeing wills' interest in the girl, whispers }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{so what do you know about her?}
<A>__{he knows a great deal. or at least he thinks he does. but his answer is nonchalant }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{that she's just a kid.}
<A>__{he takes the woman gently by the elbow and guides her away. he steals one last look back. charlotte, returning to where she was sitting, notices wills. their eyes meet and a charge passes between them. meanwhile an old man has risen from his chair }
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{i met ella at city college in 1938...}
<A>__{wills slowly turns and walks away.}
<T>__{music and titles in:}
<L>__{exterior manhattan subway stop autumn dusk}
<A>__{a swarm of pedestrians ascends the steps to the bustling street. find charlotte amid the swarm, struggling with a load of boxes and shopping bags, carrying an antique, wood and wire dressmaker's mannequin. she wears a peasant dress with a cycle jacket, a backpack, and another eccentric hat.}
<L>__{exterior washington square park dusk}
<A>__{charlotte makes her way down the leaf strewn pathway. wheeling the mannequin by the neck, she passes nyu students smoking, laughing, and chatting on their way to class.}
<L>__{exterior west village avenue dusk}
<A>__{charlotte hauls the mannequin down the block. a young man offers her assistance, but she politely and firmly refuses.}
<L>__{exterior west village street dusk}
<A>__{charlotte wearily hauls the mannequin across the cobblestone street, over the curb, and up to the stoop of a charming but slightly dilapidated brownstone.}
<L>__{interior brownstone foyer dusk}
<A>__{charlotte opens the door into the darkness. she hits a light switch and nothing happens. she flips it back and forth }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{she dumps her boxes and bags, then wheels in the mannequin.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{dolly! the bulb burned out!}
<T>__{music and titles out:}
<L>__{interior brownstone living room same}
<A>__{eight silhouettes are crouched in the dark room. the mantel is draped with a happy birthday banner. the coffee table is stacked with wrapped gifts.}
<L>__{interior foyer same}
<A>__{charlotte looks suspiciously at the living room door }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{dolly?}
<A>__{she tiptoes through the darkness and lays her ear against it.}
<L>__{interior living room same}
<A>__{we hear chuckles and whispers of anticipation. an older woman's raspy, boozy voice growls }
<C>__{raspy voice}
<D>__{my ass hurts.}
<A>__{a few people chuckle, but they're quickly hushed. the door knob turns and the door opens. everyone leaps up in a blaze of light }
<C>__{all}
<D>__{surprise!}
<A>__{the mannequin bursts into the room, teetering crazily, wearing charlotte's jacket, backpack, and hat. everyone flinches and screams. amid a chorus of laughter, charlotte enters. grinning, she wags a facetious finger }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{see? surprises suck!}
<L>__{interior wills' bedroom night}
<A>__{an antique clock ticks crisply on the dresser. wills stands before a mahogany mirror, buttoning a freshly laundered white shirt. lying on the cradle bed, half wrapped in a sheet, naked but for a string of pearls, is tanya, 35, raven haired, much too thin. she smokes a cigarette.}
<C>__{tanya}
<D>__{oh, wills, please, not again. it's our third date and we're already in a rut.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{but i thought you loved it.}
<A>__{she stretches with her cigarette but before she can make it to the ashtray, her ash falls on a new york magazine. on the cover is a photograph of wills standing next to a young chef in a fashionable restaurant. the caption reads: "the prodigal son returns."}
<C>__{tanya}
<D>__{oh, i do except for the fact that there isn't a single thing on the menu i can eat.}
<C>__{wills}
<P>__{(with a chuckle)}
<D>__{sure, there is; there's just very little you're willing to digest.}
<A>__{he slips in a cuff link. she affects a breezy indifference }
<C>__{tanya}
<D>__{fine then. we'll go, i will get big, fat, and horrible, and it'll serve you right.}
<A>__{wills slips on a silk tie }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{no, it won't. because it takes at least a few weeks to get fat and by then you won't even be speaking to me.}
<C>__{tanya}
<P>__{(curiously)}
<D>__{why do you say that?}
<A>__{he stops tying his tie and stares at her in the mirror }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{because we have no future. all i can offer you is this... what we have right now... nothing more meaningful... until it ends.}
<A>__{he goes back to tying his tie, then adds softly }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i could have waited to tell you, but i wanted to leave no room for misunderstanding.}
<A>__{she stares at him, speechless.}
<L>__{interior restaurant that night}
<A>__{its decor is exquisitely tasteful, its ambiance warm and convivial. the night is in full swing. most of the tables are taken and the bar is packed.}
<L>__{exterior upper east side same}
<A>__{from amid the rush of traffic, a taxi breaks free and glides to the curb in front of the restaurant. its facade is windowless. only a small brass plaque on the grey marble reveals that this is elysium. wills and eriko, 30's, japanese, aloof and stunning, emerge from the taxi, elegantly dressed, and move to the front door.}
<L>__{interior elysium continuous}
<A>__{two tipsy debutantes pass wills and eriko as they enter. one recognizes wills and smiles flirtatiously. wills stops and helps eriko off with her jacket. jesus, 30, the dashing cuban american maitre d', superbly discreet, approaches }
<C>__{jesus}
<D>__{good evening, mr. keane. will you be dining with us tonight?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{we certainly will. table seven, jesus, if it's available.}
<C>__{jesus}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{wills hands eriko's jacket to melissa, 20, the hat check girl }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{how are you, melissa?}
<C>__{melissa}
<P>__{(blushing)}
<D>__{fine, mr. keane.}
<A>__{celia, mid 20's, the chipper, blonde midwestern hostess, arrives, wearing a stunned, glassy smile.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{good evening, celia. and how }
<C>__{celia}
<P>__{(with forced cheeriness)}
<D>__{just dandy, sir, thanks!}
<C>__{jesus}
<D>__{table seven.}
<C>__{celia}
<D>__{this way, please.}
<A>__{celia, barely making eye contact with eriko, walks quickly away. wills is amused and a little confused by celia's behavior. he lays a hand on eriko's back }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i will be right with you.}
<A>__{eriko nods and follows celia. wills moves to the reservation stand where his best friend and the restaurant's manager, john volpe, 40, a brilliant, dapper, tough as nails brooklynite stands, listening to someone on the telephone. wills lays a hand on his shoulder and mutters into his ear }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{how's it going?}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(covering the phone)}
<D>__{chaos.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{the house specialty.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{easy for you to say, ya prick. waltzin' in here like you own the jointerior}
<A>__{wills laughs and takes a look into the bar. john gestures with his head in eriko's direction }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so who's the new potential ex wife? i thought you were still wastin' time with tanya von what's her name.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{we wisely agreed to cut our losses.}
<A>__{wills exits into the bar. john smiles and shakes his head. follow wills, as he glides along the bar. customers and staff greet him warmly. as he enters the main dining room, diners spot him sprinkled among them are celebrities from every walk of city life. wills greets them, stopping to shake their hands and kiss their cheeks. suddenly, celia, the hostess, red faced, blocks his path }
<C>__{celia}
<D>__{look, i have no right to say this, okay? and you can fire me if you want, but in the six weeks we've been open you've brought in six different women tonight makes seven and it's really starting to get to me.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{in what way?}
<C>__{celia}
<D>__{i have to greet them! it's like working at a dog shelter! i'm afraid to learn their names or even smile at them because i know any minute they could be put down!}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i assure you it's an absolutely painless procedure.}
<A>__{shocked, she can't help but sputter a laugh }
<C>__{celia}
<D>__{it is?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{sure.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{especially for me.}
<A>__{they both laugh. he moves closer, lowers his voice, and speaks with warm sincerity }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{actually, i appreciate your concern, celia. the truth is i'm a little worried myself.}
<C>__{celia}
<D>__{seriously?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{seriously. i've been trying to do better.}
<P>__{(uneasily)}
<D>__{but... you know how it is... old habits die hard.}
<C>__{celia}
<D>__{so i'm not fired?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{nope. in fact, john's been looking for an assistant. tell him you've just been promoted.}
<A>__{wills smiles, pats her in the shoulder, and moves on. she can't believe it. a waiter carrying a birthday cake blazing with candles and decorated with a woman's hat made of meringue latticework passes by on his way to the rear dining room. from inside, voices begin to sing happy birthday. wills, his curiosity piqued, follows.}
<L>__{interior rear dining room continuous}
<A>__{the waiter sets down the cake at the center of a round table. there's a cheer and applause as the song ends. wills cannot see whose birthday it is because the waiter blocks his view. just as wills is about to exit the room, the waiter steps away. wills glances over and sees the birthday girl. at first he can't place her, but then he does, and his face softens and brightens. it's charlotte. she wears a black velvet dress and a wonderfully eccentric hat. her eyes glow in the candlelight. through the chorus of voices, urging her to make a wish, she cries out }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{you guys! let me think!}
<P>__{(concentrating)}
<D>__{okay. okay.}
<A>__{charlotte blows hard, and, with a little more effort than you might expect, extinguishes the candles. everyone applauds and cheers. to charlotte's right sits simon loring, late 20's, english, sardonic, adoring. he gestures at her chest and says }
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{watch carefully, everyone they ought to begin emerging any moment now.}
<A>__{everyone laughs. charlotte playfully slaps him }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{very funny! actually, any moment now you're gonna turn straight and fall at my feet.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{oh, darling, you know i would if i could.}
<A>__{charlotte's best friend, shannon harris, 19, a spoiled but big hearted redhead, drowning in curls, mutters }
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{the only time he falls at your feet now is when he wants to borrow your prada loafers.}
<A>__{more laughter. back to wills. he considers approaching charlotte, but then he looks back and sees eriko sitting alone at their table, idly stabbing at her drink with a straw. regretting his rudeness, he takes a step toward her, but then hears }
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{is that wills keane?}
<A>__{he turns and sees dolores talbot, 70, blonde wig, spindly frame, weathered skin, large, sad eyes. she holds a mixed drink }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{it sure as hell is and he hasn't changed a bit!}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i'm sorry, do i }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you little fool, it's dolores talbot. dolly!}
<A>__{his smile shows uneasy surprise }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{my god, it is.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{yeah, i know, time's kicked my ass but good. come on, romeo, let's bury the hatchet. give me a hug. careful of the cocktail.}
<A>__{as he hugs dolores, he can't help but look over at charlotte again.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{so what the hell're you doin' around here? last i heard you were out in earthquake country blowin' the family fortune.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{actually, i doubled it.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{good for you!}
<A>__{on charlotte. she looks over. her view is such that she sees wills but not dolores. a faint blush creeps into charlotte's cheeks. she pretends to listen as shannon tells a story }
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{ and you know how bouncer's get. he's like, "that's the worst fake i.d. i've ever seen." and i'm like, "yeah? well, you have the worst dread extensions!" and then just when }
<A>__{noticing charlotte's distraction, simon whispers calmly to her }
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{are you feeling all right? you look positively green.}
<A>__{charlotte speaks under her breath without moving her lips }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{he's here. and he's staring at me again.}
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{no way!}
<A>__{both shannon and simon turn to look, but like lightning charlotte grabs them both }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{don't!}
<P>__{(to simon)}
<D>__{wait a few seconds, then go to the bathroom.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{how will i know him?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{he's beautiful. and much older.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{really?}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{if he's rich you might have a fight on your hands.}
<A>__{charlotte watches furtively as simon rises from his chair and walks over. as he passes wills, he flashes him a seductive smile. wills is confused by it.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{okay, look.}
<A>__{shannon swivels her head and throws an aloof, vacant stare in wills' direction. then she looks back at charlotte, mouth agape }
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{he's as old as my dad!}
<A>__{charlotte laughs. back on wills. he does his best to be attentive as dolores exhales a plume of smoke into his face }
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{sure, l.a.'s okay if you're a cactus or a lizard, but if you're a new englander, your soul dries up and blows away like a god damn leaf.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{it only took me twenty years to come to my senses.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{so what're you doin' now? you owned some restaurants out there, didn't you?}
<A>__{on charlotte. she sits listening to shannon }
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{and so, after all that, we pay our cover, we get in, and it's totally heinous! nothing but losers and }
<A>__{charlotte looks over and pales, her eyes widening }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{oh, shit.}
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{dolores walks up, hauling wills by the arm }
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{kids! i want you to meet an old chum of mine, the owner of this fine establishment wills keane!}
<A>__{the table greets him. wills, slightly self conscious, looks at everyone but charlotte.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{and that over there's the birthday girl my granddaughter, charlotte.}
<A>__{the news hits wills hard. but he does his best to hide it. he musters a casual smile }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{not katie and jay's daughter?}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{you bet. she got her height from her dad. but her talent's all katie's.}
<A>__{dolores indicates the hat that charlotte's wearing }
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{made it herself from scratch. that one, too.}
<P>__{(to shannon)}
<D>__{honey, show 'im.}
<A>__{shannon makes an elaborate comic show of modeling the hat she's wearing. the table laughs. wills levels his gaze at charlotte }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{impressive.}
<A>__{try as she might to accept the compliment with grace, charlotte can't help but grin.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{the wine steward stands at a station on which sit two bottles of champagne on ice. he reaches for one. wills stops him }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i think we can do better than that.}
<A>__{the steward, understanding, nods and departs, taking the champagne with him.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{happy birthday, charlotte.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{shannon}
<P>__{(under her breath)}
<D>__{twenty years old and never been...}
<C>__{charlotte}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{amused, he flashes charlotte his most dazzling smile.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i will let you get back to your celebration.}
<P>__{(kissing dolly's cheek)}
<D>__{a pleasure to see you again.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{same here.}
<A>__{wills turns to exit. simon, returning to his seat, murmurs seductively to wills as he passes by }
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{leaving so soon?}
<A>__{wills looks at him, confused again, then continues on. as simon sits, he mutters to charlotte }
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{be still my beating heart.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{or is that your heart?}
<C>__{shannon}
<P>__{(whisper to charlotte)}
<D>__{you're not really into him, are you?}
<A>__{charlotte turns to dolores who has just sat down.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{hey, dolly, how do you know him?}
<C>__{dolly}
<P>__{(uneasily)}
<D>__{from newport. old friend of your mom's.}

<A>__{charlotte, standing in the small antiquated kitchen, wearing flannel pajamas, tenses when she hears the phone ringing upstairs. she snatches an apple from a bowl and dashes out of the room. follow charlotte running through the dining room... into the living room... into the foyer... and up a dark staircase.}

<A>__{a startling clash of childhood, adolescence, and womanhood. everything from stuffed animals to posters of pop icons to volumes of great literature.}

<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{kinda cool, kinda creepy. anyway, you wanna speak to my grandmother?}

<P>__{(with a chuckle)}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{olivia, 30's, wills' jamaican cook and housekeeper, enters. plump, handsome, and perpetually amused, she carries a tray laden with continental breakfast and a new york times. wills mouths a greeting. she smiles back and sets the tray on a table.}

<D>__{i called because i'm going to be attending a benefit... a black and white ball.... and i'd like you to design a hat... for my date.}

<D>__{it's a gift. i don't have her measurements, but she's about your size. what're you, a six?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{good then let's assume your hat size is also the same.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{but that doesn't necessarily }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{it's a risk we'll just have to take.}
<A>__{charlotte runs over to her sewing table, looking for a pen and paper. she finds paper, but no pen }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{her dress is a sheath... sleeveless, black. the hat must, of course, be black or white or both.}
<A>__{she finds a pen but it doesn't work. she grabs an eyeliner and uses that }

<D>__{bye.}
<A>__{she clicks off the phone, wilts into a swoon on the bed, and breaks out laughing. wills, still holding the receiver, stares dreamily into the middle distance. he snaps to when olivia enters. her accent is as much queens as it is caribbean }

<C>__{wills}
<D>__{you see, charlotte, the way you know you're getting older is that you start to notice patterns. people start falling into types. pretty soon you know a person before you've even been introduced. and if it's a woman, before the romance even starts, a whisper in your head tells you exactly what it is and how long it's going to last. and the saddest, the most tedious, part of all is that that little voice is almost always right.}

<P>__{(sitting)}
<D>__{it's most common in children. in young adults, the condition is extremely rare. in charlotte's case, the tumor is located in her chest. it's growing rapidly and has proved resistant to both irradiation and chemotherapy. and because of its proximity to her aorta, surgery is out of the question.}

<A>__{he can't help but smile. encouraged, she moves closer }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{and then our friends would say we were just into each other for weird psychological reasons. you know, because i'm looking for a daddy substitute and you're looking for someone you can feel superior to so you won't have to confront how scared you are of real intimacy and, of course, they'd be right and eventually we'd break up.}

<D>__{ever?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{no, the answer to that's pretty obvious. i meant tonight. on the roof.}
<A>__{wills breaks into a grin }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{you're not serious.}
<A>__{wills laughs to himself, then glances up and sees the reflection of the driver's amused eyes in the rearview mirror. wills smiles back at charlotte }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{of course not. why would i want to do something like that?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{that's what i was wondering. i thought, "we're so happy he'd have no reason to do it. and if he did do it, he'd at least look guilty, wouldn't he? but he doesn't. he looks more relaxed than before the party started."}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{well, there you have it.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{but then i thought, "he's a womanizer that's what they say." funny word, huh? sounds like some sorta machine. "and how do you get to be a womanizer? obviously by sleeping with lots of different women for no good reason and being really good at lying about it."}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{sure, except that }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{let me finish.}

<D>__{if you're lying to me, i will know it.}

<D>__{did you have sex with wendy on the roof?}
<A>__{he smiles at her as though he were indulging a child. she looks him deeply in the eye and opens a button of his shirt. she slips her palm inside, over his heart. still smiling, he doesn't move a muscle. their eyes are locked. ever so slowly, her face crumples and tears appear in her eyes. she shakes her head }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{my god... oh my god.}
<A>__{she slides away from him, drops her face into her hands, and begins to cry. wills looks down, then glances up at the rearview mirror. illuminated in flashes, the driver's eyes have taken on an ominous, unblinking quality as though they were the outward embodiment of his own conscience. wills looks out the window. when he finally speaks, his voice is calm and a little cold }

<C>__{charlotte}
<P>__{(distantly)}
<D>__{what about you? do you have anything better?}
<A>__{wills has no answer. charlotte slowly gets out of the car. she leans back in, her eyes narrow with disdain }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{you know, maybe you're right. maybe this is the best time to end it. because i was actually starting to love you, wills, and that's the last thing i ever wanted.}

<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{but you said wills and my mom were just friends.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{sure, but she was nuts about him. the only reason she didn't sleep with him is 'cause she was sentimental. and smart. she wanted a ring first.}

<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{actually, to be honest, peter's more than a little freaked. i mean, how could he not be? he's twenty six. his first child. a baby girl, no less. nothing really prepares you for it.}

<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{he said it's the first time since we got married that he's actually realized what marriage is. that it's forever. that he can't just pick up and run away to nepal or something if we have a fight. that he's part of the cycle of things now. that he's gonna die some day. that it's the next generation's turn to take the stage.}
