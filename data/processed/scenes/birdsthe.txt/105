<A>__{close shot a lone gull flying low over the water, the camera tracking it. the bay is silent. the gull spreads its wings to brake, and then sits on the water. the camera continues low over the water, going through thousands of gulls sitting there patiently, as if it is threading itself through a crowd, not a sound, over the gulls, and then lifting to show the brenner house in the distance. full shot the brenner house behind the panes of glass, we can see the boards mitch nailed across the windows. he is on the roof now, testing the two attic dormer windows. he turns to look out over the bay. long shot the bay covered with sitting gulls. in the distance, the town is still smoldering. but the sky is clear of birds. med. shot mitch picking up his hammer, sliding over the shingles to where the ladder leans against the side of the house. full shot the house as mitch comes down the ladder and melanie turns the corner, carrying a load of driftwood and old lumber. two shot melanie and mitch as she drops the wood outside the door and he joins her. she is looking out over the bay when he comes to her. this is not the melanie we saw at the beginning of the picture. her hair is disarrayed, and her face and clothing are streaked with soot. but beyond a surface physical appearance, there is a weary wisdom in her eyes, and a strength to her as she stands looking toward the distant smoldering town.}

<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(looking)}
<D>__{even the birds sitting out there. it does look very much the same, mitch. this could be last week.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{it may not be last week again for a long long time.}
<A>__{they are both silent.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{look. they're still coming.}
<A>__{mitch nods. silence.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{do you want to try your father again?}
<P>__{(melanie shakes her}
