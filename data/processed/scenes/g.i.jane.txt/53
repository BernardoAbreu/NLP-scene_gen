<L>__{intercutting trainees and instructors:}
<C>__{class}
<D>__{yes, sir!}
<C>__{the chief}
<D>__{then why aren't you all over the man next to you?}
<A>__{the class pivots 90 degrees and starts to close rank. behind jordan, montgomery (a.k.a. "flea") hesitates: he's a bantam weight from georgia, his manners bred into the bone. he just can't find a delicate way to grab jordan without mounting her.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{just do it, okay?}
<C>__{instructor johns}
<D>__{if you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! i want nuts to butts!}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{come on, montgomery...}
<C>__{instructor johns}
<D>__{flea! o'neil! why is there a break in that line?}
<A>__{finally jordan grabs flea by the neck, pushes him ahead and mounts him. the class closes down into a long human snake.}
<C>__{jordan}
<P>__{(in his ear)}
<D>__{montgomery, why do they call you "flea"?}
<C>__{flea}
<D>__{it's really "f. lee montgomery" but that gets whittled down to just "flea." for short, ma'am.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{so it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?}
<C>__{flea}
<D>__{no, ma'am.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{well, flea, i appreciate the respect you just showed me. but i don't need it and don't want it not that kind of respect, anyway. it's just gonna hurt us both, okay?}
<C>__{flea}
<D>__{i will work on it, ma'am.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{do that.}
<C>__{instructor pyro}
<P>__{(to the chief)}
<D>__{time.}
<C>__{the chief}
<D>__{check your watch, pyro. seems fast.}
<A>__{camera polls the grim, blue lipped faces in the water. jordan feels flea starting to shake. badly.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{hey. you okay, flea?}
<C>__{flea}
<D>__{'snot me. it's him.}
<A>__{two bodies ahead, it's the big bruiser, miller, who's shuddering. jordan feels him shaking through flea.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{jesus, my hands... they aren't workin' right...}
<C>__{newberry}
<D>__{how long i'zis for?}
<C>__{wickwire}
<D>__{'sposed to be 20 minute intervals, no more.}
<C>__{newberry}
<D>__{swear each time's gettin' longer.}
<C>__{mccool}
<D>__{this where you bailed last time, wick?}
<C>__{wickwire}
<D>__{huh uh but wasn't middla february last time, either.}
<C>__{flea}
<D>__{how you doin', miller? miller?}
<A>__{no answer. bad sign. on shore:}
<C>__{instructor pyro}
<D>__{22 minutes...}
<A>__{ignoring, the chief lifts his bullhorn:}
<C>__{the chief}
<D>__{remember, all this is completely voluntary. for any of you who don't want to continue, instructor johns is now serving coffee and danish at the ambulance.}
<A>__{a portable light comes on. indeed, an instructor is setting up coffee service.}
<C>__{the chief}
<D>__{any takers?}
<C>__{slutnik}
<D>__{he's the fuckin' antichrist.}
<C>__{mccool}
<D>__{wick! they really got donuts over there? or just some'a last night's dinner rolls?}
<C>__{flea}
<D>__{look like donuts to me...}
<C>__{jordan}
<P>__{(in disbelief)}
<D>__{what're you guys doing? huh?}
<C>__{mccool}
<D>__{just askin'}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{what, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist? how dumb you gotta be? that's exactly what they }
<A>__{suddenly the line rips apart. it's miller, breaking for shore.}
<C>__{class}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{soon the dyke is bursting everywhere: four others break rank, following miller's lead. the deserters stagger onto the beach. medics close in quick, draping them with blankets, shining flashlights in their faces, asking brain check question.}
<C>__{medics}
<D>__{tell me what day this is... look at me now... what city are you from, sailor... here, look right here...}
<A>__{a medic nods to the chief. no hypothermia. not yet.}
<C>__{the chief}
<D>__{you want another minute to think about this? huh?}
<P>__{(no response; to miller directly)}
<D>__{do any of you want to reconsider?}
<A>__{avoiding his eyes, miller wags his head.}
<C>__{the chief}
<D>__{johnson. get 'em out of my scan.}
<A>__{it's a death sentence. as the quitters slouch for the coffee truck...}
<C>__{instructor pyro}
<D>__{by my watch... which, of course appears to be broken... they've been in 27 minutes without the benefit of protective gear.}
<A>__{tight on the chief. scanning the remaining trainees. thinking about holding out out for one more. tight on jordan. knowing who he's waiting for. wondering if she can outlast him.}
<C>__{the chief}
<P>__{(into bullhorn)}
<D>__{everybody out.}
<A>__{with a shivering cheer, the trainees stampede ashore, grabbing blankets, trading body bumps and high fives. jordan gets swept up in the esprit: they've conquered a common enemy. but when she tries to get high fived... the guys turn their backs. it's a cold rebuff, worse then any water. hold tight on jordan. shivering. watching the guys drift away. hating them.}
<C>__{wickwire}
<D>__{hey. way to gut it out.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{thanks, wick.}
