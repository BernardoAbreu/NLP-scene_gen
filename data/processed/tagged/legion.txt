<A>__{the mojave desert dusk vast. barren. no signs of life. a blood red sun is sinking behind the distant mountains. the unbearable heat will soon become an unbearable cold. a young woman's voice. solemn. weary. determined.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{when i was a little girl, my mother would remind me each night before bed to be sure to open my heart to god, for he was kind, merciful and just. things changed after my father left a few years later, leaving her to raise me and my brothers alone in a little place out on the edge of the mojave desert. she never talked about a kind and merciful god again. instead she spoke of a prophecy. of a time when all the world would be covered in darkness and the fate of mankind would be decided. one night i finally got up the courage to ask my mother why god had changed, why was he mad at his children. "i don't know," she said, tucking the covers around me, "i guess he just got tired of all the bullshit."}
<A>__{and with these words the last trace of sunlight is snuffed out, leaving us in:}
<B>__{darkness...}
<A>__{a darkness filled with the sounds of sirens, glass shattering, sporadic gunfire...a city falling into chaos. title: "los angeles, december 23rd 1:02 a.m."}
<B>__{a blood red moon}
<A>__{reflected in a greasy puddle of water. might just be the smog that's making it that ominous color. then we notice something moving in the reflection. a dark shape, growing, coming down at us fast. beat...then wham!}
<B>__{two black boots}
<A>__{land hard in the water...and we're in:}
<L>__{exterior an alley way late night}
<A>__{a dark figure in a tattered trench coat tumbles onto the pavement, hands out to slow the impact. a beat then slowly he climbs to his feet, recovering from what seems to have been quite a fall. he has chiseled features, shaved head, deep set eyes. looks like he's been through one hell of a fight. his name, we will come to know, is michael. he quickly checks out his surroundings, nothing but brick walls above him. where'd this guy jump from? a rumble of thunder...then rain starts to hammer down. seems to motivate him. michael pulls his overcoat tight around his body and dashes toward the mouth of the alley. he reaches the street just in time to see a fleet of police cars tearing around the corner, sirens wailing, heading this way. he reels back into the alley way, ducks down behind a trash dumpster, as the blue and red lights of the police cars whip past. michael waits for the lights to disappear, then he pulls a massive ornate knife from his jacket. considers it grimly. runs his finger along its edge. blood beads up. razor sharp. michael begins to peel off his overcoat, revealing his bare chest underneath...and skin literally covered with dark tatoos. hard to see what they are in this light. as his coat falls to the ground, we drift over to the brick wall behind him where we see michael's shadow crouch over, and then... ...two large shapes unfold from his back, stretching up into}
<B>__{what are unmistakably...the shadow of wings.}
<A>__{the rain pounds harder, as if punishment from the heavens. the glint of the knife coming down fast.}
<B>__{a horrendous sound of flesh tearing away from bone... ...the bloody knife clattering to the pavement...}
<A>__{...followed by michael's ungodly scream rising up from the alley way. and then silence... close on the gutter, as blood begins to flow freely, mixing,}
<B>__{swirling with the rain...}
<L>__{exterior city street a short while later}
<A>__{michael, face tight with pain, trench coat back on, steps out of the alley, stares with determination at a dark storefront across the street. "gun & sport world"}
<L>__{interior gun & sport world a short while later}
<A>__{cavernous. a costco for survivalists. quiet except for the sound of rain, then... smash! michael drops down through one of the skylights in a shower of glass.}
<L>__{interior gun & sport world bathroom moments later}
<A>__{michael bursts in. tosses a first aid kit into the sink. his trench coat falls to the floor and here in the fluorescent light, we get a better look at him. his thin but stunningly well muscled body is tattooed shoulder to ankle with intricate writing. the man's flesh is a living book. but the writing is in no language we recognize. he turns his back to the mirror, revealing two horrifically open wounds running down between both shoulder blades.}
<B>__{fresh. bloody.}
<A>__{he threads a needle not with thread, but with fishing wire, and begins to stitch the wounds closed. blood pools on the cement floor around his feet.}
<L>__{interior gun & sport world moments later}
<A>__{trench coat and a shirt back on, michael races along the endless racks of guns, searching for just the right weapons, his every movement precise, as if he's trained his whole life for this. weapon after ferocious weapon gets tossed into rifle bags. whatever this guy's preparing for, it's big. rifle bags filled, michael heads for the exit. stops cold. the place is locked up tight. metal gate over the front doors, bars over the windows. how the hell's he going to get out of here?}
<L>__{interior lapd squad car driving same}
<A>__{two cops, world weary, cruise through downtown. that's burton behind the wheel, estevez riding shotgun. the police radio is abuzz with activity. busy night. burton stares out at the city's rain soaked denizens with a deep hatred, the shadows looming in doorways, the streetwalkers.}
<C>__{burton}
<D>__{goddamn' animals. nights like this i wish i could take a match to this city just so i could watch all these motherfuckers burn.}
<C>__{estevez}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{a good ol' boy barbecue, huh?}
<A>__{burton doesn't even smile. he's dead fucking serious.}
<C>__{burton}
<D>__{a fresh start. that's what this place needs.}
<A>__{he holds his finger up like a pistol. aims it at the people they pass, picking them off one by one.}
<C>__{burton}
<D>__{pow! pow! pow!}
<A>__{now burton laughs, a dark, mean laugh. estevez eyes his partner, wary.}
<C>__{estevez}
<D>__{jesus... you know burton, i'm so happy we get to share beautiful moments like this. they really brighten my da }
<A>__{kaboom! through the windshield, we see a storefront explode just ahead, raining fiery debris onto the squad car. burton slams on the breaks and the cops look up just in time to see...}
<L>__{exterior gun & sport world continuous}
<A>__{michael, bulging rifle bags in each hand, stepping brazenly out of the gaping hole he's blown in the front of the store.}
<C>__{estevez }
<D>__{freeze!}
<A>__{estevez and burton are already out of the squad car, crouching behind the open doors, guns trained on michael.}
<C>__{estevez}
<D>__{drop the bags! hands on your head!}
<A>__{in the distance, the pop pop of gunfire. the police radio crackles with urgent chatter. many voices talking at once. "shots fired...code three...officer down!" the cops shift about nervously, trying to stay focused.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(sensing their unease:)}
<D>__{it's starting. there isn't much time.}
<A>__{the cops shoot a quick, anxious glance at each other "what the hell?" then they turn back to michael.}
<C>__{burton}
<D>__{shut the fuck up and drop the bags now!}
<A>__{michael lets the gun bags hit the ground.}
<C>__{estevez}
<D>__{hands on your head! on your head!}
<A>__{michael slowly places his palms on his skull.}
<C>__{burton}
<D>__{turn around! turn the fuck around!}
<A>__{michael slowly turns around. calm. estevez rushes in to restrain michael, grabbing his wrist, fingers tightening. michael closes his eyes, a terrible decision made. and that's when he moves, a fucking blur! in an instant michael's broken the cop's arm, spinning him helplessly around, turning him into a human shield. now it's michael who's in charge, gun to estevez's head, facing off with burton. burton struggles to find a shot, can't.}
<C>__{burton}
<D>__{let `em go!}
<C>__{estevez}
<D>__{take the shot, burton!}
<C>__{burton}
<D>__{i said let `em fuckin' g g g g }
<A>__{suddenly burton starts to shake, the words stuck in his throat like a skipping record.}
<C>__{estevez}
<D>__{burton!?}
<A>__{the street lamps begin to flicker and strobe, adding to the confusion. burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his whole body quaking, heels clicking the pavement, as if some massive pressure were building inside him. and with the horrific sound of cracking bones, burton's mouth}
<B>__{begins to twist into an impossibly wide smile like a bizarre}
<A>__{clown! his eyes snap open, focused, the force inside him now fully in control. burton looks at michael with calm recognition, his voice guttural..inhuman. a man possessed.}
<C>__{burton}
<D>__{what are you doing, michael? these weren't your orders.}
<A>__{estevez looks at his partner with confusion.}
<C>__{estevez}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<A>__{michael, however, seems to know exactly who he's talking to.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i'm following my own orders now.}
<C>__{burton}
<D>__{then you will die along with the child.}
<C>__{estevez}
<D>__{burton, you fuckin' know this guy?!}
<A>__{blam! burton shoots his partner in the head. estevez drops, leaving michael without cover. burton re aims, but michael's faster, already firing back. bullets rip up the concrete. smash! the squad car window shatters, burton's chest exploding! and down he goes, leaving michael the only one left standing. smoke rising from his gun. with soldier like efficiency, michael picks up the rifle bags and begins to load them into the trunk of the squad car. he gets in the car and floors it, roaring away, as the flickering street lamps finally go out in rapid succession, a wave chasing him, plunging the entire city into darkness...}

<L>__{interior jeep's room just before dawn}
<A>__{jeep switches on a lamp, illuminating this incredibly cramped bedroom. not much larger than the bed itself. he's got shaggy hair, a sensitive face, clearly not big on sunlight.}
<L>__{exterior desert pre dawn}
<A>__{a couple of ancient silverstream trailers are bathed in the eerie blue light of night's final moments. it looks like the trailers haven't moved from this patch of barren ground in decades. a single strand of colored christmas lights dot the trailers roof lines, marking the season. one of the trailer doors creaks open and jeep steps wearily out into the cool western morning. home. nothing but desert for miles in all directions, save for a two lane highway and a weather beaten truck stop diner that jeep and his father will open for business in a few hours. jeep gazes up to the diner's slanted roof where a large sign glows like a beacon in the darkness: "paradise falls gas `n' grub" a beat as jeep contemplates the sign.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{you okay, jeep?}
<A>__{jeep turns to see charlie, a very pregnant girl of about twenty, standing in the trailer doorway, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. even with the trailer trash veneer, she's strikingly beautiful.}

<D>__{sorry to wake you, charlie.}

<D>__{another bad dream?}
<A>__{he struggles for a moment, nods.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's just stress, jeep, that's all. you do too much worryin'. about this place. about your dad.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{about me...}

<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{you're the only thing i like worrying about.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{see what i mean? you're worried about a girl eight months pregnant and it isn't even your baby. now that's enough to give anybody nightmares.}
<A>__{jeep turns away, dejected.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{go ahead, make fun of me. everybody else does.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(turns him back around)}
<D>__{c'mon, i was only kiddin'. you know how much i appreciate everything you and bob are doing for me, but a month from now, this baby'll have a new family and i will have to start thinkin' about what the hell i'm doin' with my life.}
<A>__{this is not news jeep wants to hear.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{so you're still going through with it...?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{jeep, i'm not ready to be a mama. christ, i can barely take care of myself as it is.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{i could help you. we could do it together, you know? i want to.}
<A>__{charlie smiles sadly at him, touched by his sweetness, but this just isn't where she's at.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you gotta stop carryin' the weight of the world on your shoulders.}
<A>__{jeep nods, tries to hide the fact that he's dying inside.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(rubbing her arms)}
<D>__{now can we go back in? i'm freezing my ass off out here.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{go on. i will be right there.}
<A>__{charlie kisses him on the cheek and heads back to the trailer. he watches her, longing in his eyes. with the clank of the door, she's gone. and over jeep's troubled look, the perennial holiday cheer of frank capra's "it's a wonderful life" mixes up.}

<D>__{i don't know whether i like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{it's a wonderful life playing on a crummy tv jimmy stewart as george bailey has just met clarence, his guardian angel in training. the signal rolls and snows in and out. we hear a whack, which causes the image to momentarily improve and then slowly roll back the other way.}

<D>__{oh, i've got to earn them and you'll help me, won't you?}
<L>__{interior paradise falls gas `n' grub day}
<A>__{bob hansen (late 40's), owner and proprietor of this fine roadside establishment, attempts to fix the old tv hanging in the corner above the counter by banging the shit out it. the restaurant itself has the kind of grungy diner charm you'd hope to find in a place last renovated in 1963. an old plastic christmas tree strung with flickering lights and tinsel occupies a lonely corner. next to that, a faded diorama of the nativity scene. the kind you might order off the shopping network. bob considers the tv with a frown. he deftly rolls an engraved silver zippo back and forth over the nicotine stained fingers of his right hand. must be a nervous habit. you can tell just by looking at the man that he's a beer drinker. behind the counter, a black man named percy walker (60's) is cooking up a storm on the grill with spectacular one handed dexterity. you do get pretty good at this sort of thing when your other hand has long been replaced by a metal hook. the dog tags around his neck tell the story. his white cook's hat has been temporarily replaced by a red santa hat.}

<D>__{lord as my witness, bob, one of these days that thing's gonna hit you back.}

<D>__{whaddya talkin' about, percy? we got a special relationship here.}
<A>__{whack!}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{yeah, they got names for that kind a relationship.}
<A>__{the jukebox on the other side of the diner starts up with the merle haggard tune "i'm a lonesome fugitive". a stunning looking sixteen year old girl with dyed black hair and a piercing or three, is leaning seductively over the jukebox, swaying gently to the music. the headband doubling as her mini skirt reveals her knock out figure in a way that really doesn't leave much up to the imagination. she's a billboard of rebellion.}

<D>__{it's disgusting.}
<C>__{howard }
<D>__{you're right. it is disgusting.}
<A>__{watching the scintillating action from a booth across the diner is a conservatively dressed suburban couple. sandra and howard anderson. fish out of water.}

<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{good thing we stopped here.}

<A>__{the stereo in this rig could shake mountains. kyle williams (late 20's) handsome as hell, thug style. a straight up bad boy. he passes a weathered road sign: "entering paradise falls, next services 50 miles" kyle's expression says this is not good news. he grabs his cell phone off the passenger seat. no signal.}

<A>__{he spots the truck stop diner just up the road ahead...}
<L>__{exterior paradise falls gas `n' grub continuous}
<A>__{the escalade pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at the lonely row of old gas pumps. kyle gets out and surveys the scenery with dismay. now in the daytime we see this is truly a place time forgot. attached to the diner is a mechanic's bay. grease stains and rusty car parts litter the ground. behind the place is the silverstream trailer we saw jeep step out of earlier. the only thing here that looks fairly new is the uhaul truck parked in front of the garage with its hood up. kyle grabs a crumpled hand drawn map from the front seat and flattens it out on the roof of the car. he spins it around. which way is north?}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{darren, your fuckin' directions suck, man.}
<A>__{he checks his cell phone again. no chance of a signal way out here. so he shuffles around to the side of the diner in search of a pay phone. the good news is that he finds one. the bad news is that it's been broken for ten years. leaning next to the broken phone, however, is charlie wearing a shabby, faded waitress uniform stretched tight around her very pregnant belly. adding to her perfect mother to be look is that cigarette dangling from her lips. the plastic name tag pinned to her chest says "charlie".}

<D>__{yeah, i'm okay. this guy's just lost.}
<A>__{jeep nods, uncertain, eyes kyle another moment, then he shuffles along out of sight. charlie brings the cigarette back up to her lips. an awkward beat.}

<A>__{the door jingles. charlie and kyle enter. audrey's eyes light up when she sees kyle. he notices her as well. how couldn't he? she's directing every ounce of sex appeal she has in his direction. her parents, on the other hand, shoot a look of utter fear in kyle's direction, as if he personified their worst suburban nightmare. charlie heads to the register. digs out a fresh pack of smokes from underneath the counter.}

<A>__{bob gives the tv one final wallop whack! and the picture snaps into focus. only it isn't the picture he was expecting. the stark graphic of the emergency broadcasting system and its accompanying hollow tone fill the diner. everybody in the place stops and turns to the tv.}

<D>__{nice work, bob. what the hell's that?}

<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{don't look like a test.}

<A>__{kyle peels a five dollar bill off a serious wad of cash. that gets bob's attention. bob snaps the money out of his hand.}

<A>__{percy grabs an old battery powered radio off a kitchen shelf. switches it on. static. he spins the dial until he reaches a clear signal. the same hollow tone of emergency broadcasting. station after station the same thing. the diner is overwhelmed by a chilling chorus of hollow tones. everyone goes very still.}

<D>__{exactly. could be nothing to worry about.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{so then why's the tv out?}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{maybe it just hit the relay stations. aren't those usually in remote areas?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{yeah, `cause of the radiation they give off.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{there ain't no radiation comin' from those things. plus that don't explain the radio being out too. some of those stations broadcast over hundreds of miles. any quake that big and we would a felt it.}
<C>__{charlie}

<C>__{bob}
<D>__{don't move!}
<A>__{but gladys not only moves, she scurries right up the fucking wall like some kind of bizarre crab! bob can't believe his eyes. but he gets over it real fast, as the crab lady rushes toward him across the ceiling upside down! bob pumps the shotgun, trying to take her down, but he can't track her fast enough. instead he blows enormous holes in the ceiling, a rain of plaster. gladys drops down right in front of bob.}

<D>__{somebody help me!}

<D>__{your teeth goddamn it! lemme see `em!}
<A>__{michael offers up a dangerous smile, revealing a not so well kept but definitely normal set of teeth. bob and the others ease slightly.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{no, shark teeth, pop.}
<A>__{bob lowers the gun.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{okay... suppose you tell us your name then.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{michael.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{sorry about all that, michael. this old lady just went crazy inside my place here. she had these teeth. never seen anything like `em. practically bit a man in half.}
<A>__{michael remains silent. doesn't seemed shocked in the least by what he's heard.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{so what are you doin' out here? gotta say you don't exactly look like a police officer. even one from l.a. then again, you have to be, right? i mean, who the hell'd be crazy enough to steal a cop car?}
<A>__{bob chuckles for a moment. when michael doesn't respond in kind, bob falls silent. anxious. he slowly raises the shotgun again. michael sizes up this raggedy group. his gaze drifts over to the loosely wrapped body in front of the diner. the plastic table cloth flaps wildly in the wind. turning back to bob:}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you don't know, do you?}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{know what?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we don't know anything. nothing's working here. the tv, the radio, the phone...}
<A>__{michael just shakes his head.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i'm running out of time.}
<A>__{michael steps toward charlie with a sense of purpose, but bob blocks his path, brandishing the shotgun.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{back off, fella...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now, i don't care if this is the second coming of jesus fucking christ, i say it's time for you to either get talkin' or get the hell outta here!}
<A>__{in a blur of movement, michael rips the shotgun from bob's hands. it all happens so fast that bob is stunned to find himself holding air. he's even more stunned to now have the barrel of the gun pressed to the bridge of his nose. everyone freezes.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{easy! easy!}
<A>__{michael's expression is totally calm. merciless.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{c'mon, dad, tell `em you're sorry. tell `em you were only kidding!}
<A>__{but bob can't even speak, he's so scared. he squeezes his eyes closed.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{let `em go!}
<A>__{michael's eyes flit momentarily in charlie's direction. considering her. the diner door opens and percy steps cautiously out with hand and hook held up to show no threat. he's followed by sandra and audrey. michael sees them, but offers no indication that he cares.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{now, son, i'm sure you don't wanna go spillin' blood for no good reason in front of all these decent people, do ya? our friend bob here ain't worth the trouble it'd cause ya.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so whaddya say `bout just lettin' `im go and then you can be on your way? nice `n' easy.}
<A>__{but michael doesn't seem to register this plea. it's not looking good. no one breathes. that's when kyle notices something out in the direction of the road.}
<B>__{dozens of tiny headlights appearing in the dark haze. approaching.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{what the ?}
<A>__{michael turns, sees the lights.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{they're here.}
<A>__{michael whips the gun away from bob's head and thrusts it back into his hands. bob's looks down at the gun, speechless.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you're going to need this.}
<A>__{michael walks swiftly around to the trunk of the cruiser. pops it, revealing a staggering arsenal of weaponry.}
<B>__{he begins to load gun after gun.}
<A>__{percy stares out at the lights, eyes wide.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{lord, have mercy.}
<P>__{(waving back audrey and sandra)}
<D>__{you ladies best get back inside.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{what is it? what's happening? who is this man? why's he driving a police car?}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{shut up, mom!}
<A>__{audrey pulls her mother back into the diner. michael hands an mp5 sub machine gun to kyle. another one goes to percy. finally he places a third one in jeep's hands, who stares down at it anxiously.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{wait. i don't think that's such a good idea.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{dad, i can handle it.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(to michael)}
<D>__{he's just a kid }
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{i said, i can handle it!}
<A>__{michael's eyes narrow, studying jeep.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{he can handle it. he doesn't have a choice.}
<A>__{michael pulls out twin mp5s for himself. glock 9s are tucked everywhere they can go. michael tosses clip belts to the men. boxes of shotgun shells. the works.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{if you want to live, you'll do exactly as i say.}
<A>__{he slams the trunk closed and approaches charlie. he cocks a glock and hands it to her.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{when you fire, you keep your thumb off the slide. don't hesitate. don't do anything brave. there's no safety.}
<A>__{he gives her a hard look. she nods nervously. trusting him but not sure why. michael marches into the diner. kyle glances quickly at the others, then he bolts after michael. percy follows. then charlie. now it's only jeep and his father left.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{c'mon, jeep. we gotta go!}
<A>__{and bob rushes into the diner. a moment as jeep looks out toward the road.}
<B>__{the headlights are growing brighter. closer.}
<A>__{he contemplates the sub machine gun in his hands.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{fuck it.}
<A>__{and races after his father.}

<A>__{thrown. locking the diner door.}

<A>__{frantic activity. kyle and michael push a booth in front of the door, sealing off the entrance. tables are turned on their sides to form makeshift shields. window blinds are snap closed. the back office continuous jeep races in, locks the back door. then he pushes a desk in front of it. in the diner continuous the place is transformed. locked up tight. the roar of engines outside grows ever louder, closer. sandra huddles on the floor with howard, his head in her lap. she's running her hands gently through his hair, trying to keep calm. he opens his eyes. pale, weak from blood loss.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{sandra? what's happening?}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{it's okay! everything's okay!}
<A>__{sandra closes her eyes. struggling to believe it. suddenly the electricity goes out, dipping the room into}

<A>__{we hear cries of alarm. total black. chaos.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{jeep, get the flashlights!}
<C>__{percy }
<D>__{everybody just stay still!}
<C>__{kyle }
<D>__{now that we're locked in here, what the fuck are we supposed to do?}
<A>__{a flicker of light. and then flashlight beams cut through: the darkness...coming to rest on michael's pale face. michael looks up at the ceiling.}
<L>__{exterior paradise falls gas 'n' grub roof night}
<A>__{a hatch opens and out comes michael followed by bob, percy and kyle. they quickly take their places behind the "paradise" sign. pitch black surrounds them. the rumble of engines is gone, leaving only the rush of the wind coming up off the desert.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{where the hell did they go?}
<A>__{bob turns to michael sharply.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{alright, rambo. you got us up here. now you mind explaining what the fuck we're fighting?}
<A>__{michael is about to answer, when:}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{listen!}
<A>__{over the wind, another sound becomes audible. the delicate chime of a calliope.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{you hear what i'm hearing?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{yeah...the hell is that?}
<A>__{the calliope music grows louder, the melody more distinct. now we recognize the song: santa claus is coming to town. but instead of filling them with cheer, it fills them with dread.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{it sounds almost like...}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{ice cream.}
<A>__{two headlights appear in the darkness. and sure enough, an ice cream truck rolls slowly toward the diner. the eerie calliope music emanates from a speaker on its roof. it's too dark to see who's behind the wheel.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{you've got to be fuckin' kidding me.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{alright. there's a safety switch on the side of your gun. push it all the way down. two clicks.}
<A>__{the men quickly do as they're told.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{now when this starts, you hold on tight, you hear me? if you don't, you're going to blow your hand off. understand?}
<A>__{kyle, bob shoot quick anxious looks at percy.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{the fuck y'all lookin' at me for?}
<L>__{interior paradise falls gas 'n' grub same}
<A>__{jeep faces the boarded up front door, awkwardly holding the mp5, trying to assume a tough guy posture. if only he could stop shaking, it might be believable. charlie and audrey peer between the slats covering the windows. the ice cream truck's headlights fan across the diner. audrey and charlie back away from the windows. charlie stops next to jeep. senses him shaking. rests a hand on his arm. and that seems to help...a little. howard smiles weakly at the familiar sound of the calliope.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{oh, honey, listen. it's the ice cream man.}
<L>__{exterior paradise falls gas 'n' grub roof same}
<A>__{the ice cream truck pulls to a stop with its headlights facing the diner. everyone aims their guns at the truck. tense. from the ice cream truck...a dark bloody shoe steps to the ground. moving up the long grey pant leg spotted with blood stains to reveal a skeletally thin man in tattered coveralls. say hello to the ice cream man. he looks like he's been through hell literally. as he steps into the beams of the headlights we can see him even more clearly. he's tall. too tall. his clothes don't seem to fit him. and he's unnaturally thin as if he's been stretched like taffy. if he got down on all fours, you might mistake him for some kind of spider. he surveys the diner, the garage, the roof assessing the situation. on the roof, the men wait for something to happen.}
<C>__{kyle}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{ah, he don't look that bad.}
<A>__{the ice cream man's gaze snaps up to the roof. he heard.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{oh, shit. oh, shit. oh, shit.}
<A>__{that's when the ice cream man's jaw unhinges, stretching torturously down to nearly the middle of his chest! row after row of a razor sharp teeth form with the sickening sound of cracking of bones. from his new mouth, the ice cream man lets out an earth shattering howl. everyone except michael is practically hyperventilating with fear.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{get ready!}
<A>__{and the ice cream man bolts for the diner with startling speed! his movements aren't at all like those of a normal man, but rather like some kind of human insect. michael aims. blam! blam! blam! bullets rip into the creature's body, knocking him flat on his back. still. arms and legs in a twisted, twitching mess. michael keeps his aim. waits. the calliope music continues to play.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{is that it?}
<A>__{not even close. a rumbling of engines. headlights. a freeway full of vehicles of every variety punch through the wall of dust, racing toward the diner. they are the}
<B>__{commuters.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{now! shoot now!}
<A>__{the men let loose with ferocious firepower. windshields shatter! tires blow out! engines explode! vehicles swerve and collide! dark shapes bolt from the burning vehicles, scattering. in the flash of battle we catch glimpses of them: business}
<B>__{people. construction workers. even an entire high school}
<A>__{football team. all deformed by some demonic force. many mere balls of flame drifting through the darkness.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{spread out! don't let them get close to the windows!}
<A>__{the dark shapes converge on the diner from all directions. they move so strangely fast it seems that their feet don't actually touch the ground. from the roof it's a full on turkey shoot as the men follow michael's instructions and cut down everything in sight. their faces lighting up with each flash. shell casings spray from their weapons like water drops from a sprinkler. bodies burst and crumble to the dirt. the creatures don't seem to be afraid of dying. their strategy appears to be in their sheer numbers. with each wave, the dark figures get ever closer to the diner. on bob firing madly. then... click! click! oh, no. he's out of ammo.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{shells!}
<A>__{percy tosses him a box of shells. but bob fumbles the catch and the box slides halfway down the sloped roof.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{fuck!}
<A>__{with the gun still in one hand, bob reaches frantically down for the ammo. stretching... further... a hideously wounded middle aged housewife catapults up from below the roofline! her hair must have been in curlers before most of it burned away. her nightdress hangs in tatters off her body. her jaw clicks rapidly, as she clatters up at bob like a giant insect. bob tries to pull back, but he has no traction and he starts to slip down toward her. she's coming fast! percy sees his friend in trouble.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{bob!}
<A>__{bob swings the shotgun like a club crack! knocking the bitch clear off the roof. but the move has made his slide even faster. he drops the shotgun, trying to hold on, but he can't stop!}
<B>__{bob is about to hit the edge when the horrid woman pops up}
<A>__{right in front of him! she doesn't even have a chance to react as bob does something akin to a swimmer's push right off her body! wham! the creature goes flying back off the roof and the opposing force halts bob's slide.}
<C>__{percy}
<P>__{(extending his hook)}
<D>__{grab my hand!}
<A>__{bob reaches up and clasps percy's hook, praying that it stays on. but this chick ain't finished yet. up she comes once more. her razor sharp fingernails claw up the metal roof. screech!}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{gun!}
<A>__{percy tosses bob a glock. fortunately this time bob deftly catches it with his free hand just as the deranged woman pounces on him.}

<A>__{the creature reaches the window. sandra dives for howard's outstretched hands. she has him! the creature's progress is abruptly halted at the shattered window. it turns back toward sandra a shaft of light falling across its face, reveals: a teenage girl of about audrey's age. her skin is a deathly blue. her pupils a ghastly white. deep human fingernail scratches have torn open the bloated flesh on her arms, neck and face. the self inflicted wounds of a drug addict. her voice is not quite human.}

<A>__{and he starts to pull her arm even harder...other creatures suddenly notice her as well, focusing their attack as if she alone was their target. jeep immediately let's go of howard and dives for charlie, grabbing her free arm just before she's pulled through. without the help, audrey and sandra can't hold on any longer. howard is ripped from of his family's hands and out the window.}

<A>__{charlie cradles the baby, apprehensive. the baby looks up at her, smiles. she can't help but smile back at him. jeep eyes her.}

<D>__{look, i'm sorry for what i said to you earlier, `bout you following me around. i didn't mean it.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{nothin' to be sorry about. it's true. i did follow you around. at least now i know there was a good reason.}
<A>__{charlie's reacts, a bit stung. jeep tries to hide his pleasure that the tables have turned at least a little. charlie is about to respond when audrey leans in from the back seat.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{we're here.}
<A>__{she points ahead to a beaten up road sign that says: "now entering red rock national park, next rest stop 30 miles"}

<D>__{okay, all we gotta do is }

<L>__{interior police cruiser driving continuous}
<A>__{jeep, charlie and audrey slip frantically down in their seats as the roof presses down at them. the windows burst. jeep grabs the glock and fires wildly up at the roof.}

<A>__{gabriel takes a direct hit in the thigh, causing him to slide off the roof and onto the trunk where he grabs a hold of the rear window frame for support.}

<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{audrey, the flare gun!}
<A>__{audrey desperately tries to load a flare while avoiding gabriel's grasp. jeep can't get off another shot without the risk of hitting audrey. gabriel is almost entirely in the car now. audrey swings the flare gun toward gabriel, but he knocks her hand aside just as she pulls the trigger and the flare goes off inside the car! jeep ducks. the car swerves madly. the flare ricochets through the cabin, lighting it up like the fourth of july! gabriel lunges for charlie just as the flare bounces off the windshield ping! and nails him right in the face, setting}
<B>__{his hair ablaze.}
<A>__{and that gives jeep the chance to swing around and fire. boom! gabriel is blown back partially through the rear window. he holds onto the car with an iron grip. starts to pull himself back in. nothing slows this guy down. jeep pulls the trigger again and...click. no bullets! audrey frantically reloads the flare gun. brings it up to fire, but he's too fast! whack! gabriel knocks her into the side of the car with a sweep of his hand. she's out cold. now he's clawing his way unobstructed toward charlie again. jeep knows there's only one thing to do.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{get down on the floor!}
<A>__{charlie pushes herself and the baby down on the floor in front of the passenger seat. jeep punches it. the speedometer leaps ahead.}

<C>__{audrey }
<D>__{get off her, you fucking asshole!}
<A>__{audrey leaps onto gabriel, pulling him away from charlie just in time. he flails wildly about but this young girl rides him like one helluva a cowboy.}

<D>__{do it, jeep! do it now!}
<A>__{jeep slams on the breaks, sending gabriel and audrey shooting}

<L>__{exterior red rock ridge pre dawn}
<A>__{jeep and charlie, battered and bruised, struggle to make the long climb up the ridge. charlie looks up. stars completely fill the pre dawn sky. breathtaking.}

<D>__{how can this happen?}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{how can this happen in a world so beautiful?}
<A>__{jeep follows her gaze to the sky. endless stars. confounding. jeep shifts his eyes to the top of the ridge just ahead.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{c'mon, we're almost there.}
<A>__{they are only a few steps from the edge of the ridge when gabriel rockets up in front of them! charlie screams! jeep pushes her and the baby out of the way just as gabriel comes down hard in front of them, kicking up a cloud of dust. gabriel's mechanical wings haltingly retract. the crash has done some serious damage. much of his skin has burned away. chunks of his armor and flesh are missing as well, including a large part of his head, revealing that under his human visage is a nightmarish creature. gabriel charges at jeep fast. jeep whips up his glock, blam! gabriel takes the bullet, then slaps the gun out of jeep's hand. jeep throws a wild punch, connects with gabriel's chin, rocking him back. more annoyed than surprised, gabriel knocks jeep savagely to the ground. jeep struggles quickly to his feet, comes right back at gabriel swinging. but gabriel simply knocks him to the dirt again. jeep slowly gets up once more, bleeding, hurt. raises his fists. this kid will simply not give up. jeep moves in again, swinging hard, but gabriel blocks it, shoots out a hand and grabs jeep by throat, lifting him clear off the ground.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{so brave. so pointless. you should have worried more about saving yourself.}
<A>__{jeep's feet dangle. his eyes bulge out. he claws at gabriel's iron fast grip, but there's no hope. charlie watches in horror.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{stop! please! don't kill him!}
<A>__{but gabriel is doing just that. jeep is rapidly losing consciousness. the battle is lost.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{go to sleep...}
<A>__{jeep's eyes flutter. he's almost gone.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{stop it! i will give you the baby!}

<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't want this responsibility!}
<A>__{tears run down her face. she's dead fucking serious. gabriel lets go of jeep. he falls to the ground, gasping desperately for air.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{charlie, no!}
<A>__{gabriel takes the bundle from charlie, turning away from her.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{"and as the child's cries are extinguished, an eternal darkness at last descended upon the world."}
<A>__{he peels the cloth back, revealing...}
<B>__{the grenade.}
<A>__{he spins around to face charlie. she's holding the pin. kaboom!}
<B>__{gabriel is blown to bloody bits.}
<A>__{the creature is gone at last. the sound of a baby cooing. charlie picks the child up out of the brush. she helps jeep to his feet and together they slowly make their way to the top of the ridge.}

<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{i'm sure they're just over the next ridge.}

<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{don't be afraid. we'll be okay.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{believe me.}
<A>__{at those words, charlie looks deep into jeep's eyes. sees a confidence in them she's never seen before. and she leans in and kisses him. tender. when they part, jeep stares back at her with surprise. then the surprise melts into a smile. and they descend the ridge...out of sight, leaving us with a view once again of the mojave desert dawn a blood red sun rises behind the distant mountains. the unbearable cold will soon become an unbearable heat. and we're back where we started. a young woman's voice. solemn. weary. determined. it's charlie's voice.}

<A>__{charlie sits across from him, the baby cradled in her arms. it's strange, but you might actually mistake them for a happy family. of course you'll have to ignore the arsenal of weaponry in the back seat.}
<C>__{charlie's voice }
<D>__{...a mighty warrior fell in order to save me.}
<A>__{jeep glances over at charlie and the baby. he smiles at the image of maternal bliss.}
