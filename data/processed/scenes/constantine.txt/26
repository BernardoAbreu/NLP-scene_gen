<L>__{exterior the sky}
<A>__{one of those perfect days. with perfect clouds. so clear you feel you could reach out and touch heaven. two young girls rise into frame on side by side swings. for a moment they're suspended against that incredible sky. then gravity takes hold and they fall back to earth.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{you still with me?}
<L>__{interior subway day}
<A>__{angela's (30) weary eyes open. she's on her belly hidden between track ties and shadows even deeper. grips a police issue revolver tight. she's pinned down, unable to move.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{the man is thirty feet down the same track. their voices echo off the curved walls, come from everywhere. how either of these two got here isn't important. who will get out is.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{so what's next, detective? we gonna do a full marathon?}
<A>__{intermittent radio chatter buzzes from angela's walkie talkie. you get the sense angela is not alone in here.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{put your weapon on the tracks and step out with your hands above your head.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{or how 'bout you show yourself and i put a bullet in your skull just like i did hers!}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{that's just not going to happen.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{you sure about that?!}
<A>__{angela checks the chamber sees she has one bullet left.}
<C>__{angela}
<P>__{(almost pleading)}
<D>__{now put down your weapon on the tracks and }
<A>__{ground begins to vibrate. tunnel starts to glow.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{well ain't this a peach?!}
<A>__{angela looks back, sees several shadows of figures waving far off. her radio is flooded with futzed chatter.}
<C>__{detective weiss }
<P>__{(over radio)}
<D>__{get off the tracks! blueline is coming! clear the tracks!}
<A>__{angela peeks over the track. still no sign of her perp. the train is coming into view and its beam shoots through the tunnel, turning every particle of dust into a supernova. the sound is deafening.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{c'mon, detective, step into the light and be saved!!}
<A>__{angela looks back, squints into the brilliant light. she grips her gun and in one burst of flat out bravado rises as she aims. and there he is the man rising with his own gun. angela fires as both dive off the track. his bullet ricochets behind her. hers finds its mark. man goes down right in the train's path. angela rolls over on the side of the tracks, catches her breath. she closes her eyes and crosses herself as the train roars past in a staccato blur.}
