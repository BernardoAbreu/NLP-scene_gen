<D>__{thank you, hal. as you can see, the indians are in high spirits tonight, looking forward to their showdown with the yankees. who will start that game is still a matter of some conjecture.}
<A>__{as ross talks, dorn walks into the frame in the far background with his arm around a young lovely. they're nuzzling and hugging, unaware they're on camera, albeit in the background. suzanne doesn't miss it though. she moves closer to the screen to get a better look. dorn and the girl get in an elevator together, obviously going upstairs. as the elevator closes, suzanne hits the off button. she sits there a second in shock, and then her face begins to harden.}
