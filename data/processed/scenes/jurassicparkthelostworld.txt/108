<A>__{the remaining survivors, minus ludlow and roland, shine their flashlights around the dusty, vine hung interior of the communications room. on the wall a row of chrome letters says "we make the future," but the words are obscured by a tangle of vines. mushrooms and fungi sprout from the carpet. on one wall, there is a mural of what the completed jurassic park would have looked like. big hotels, ford explorers with tourists leaning out the windows taking pictures, big crowds at the fences around the animal exhibits. but none of it came true, and now even the mural is runny and dust covered. there is a pause, filed only with radio static. sarah looks at nick tensely, waiting. finally, a voice comes over the radio, clean as can be.}
