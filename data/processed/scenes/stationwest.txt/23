<T>__{dissolve:}
<L>__{interior mrs. caslon's mine cabin}
<A>__{iles is pacing the floor. mrs. caslon is occupied with some minor domestic chore. stellman is standing by the door. iles is a ball of fire.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{of all the stupid bonehead plays! what did he fight about don't tell me a woman?}
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{that's what they tell me.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{who started it?}
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{i don't know, but haven finished it.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{that probably strikes you as a very admirable thing.}
<A>__{stellman shrugs.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{well, i don't think so! i have men who can use their fists. why didn't they send a man who could use his brains!}
<A>__{there is a knock at the door. iles gives her a look; then glares at stellman.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{well open it up!}
<A>__{stellman opens the door and haven walks in. he pauses, glances around and smiles. mrs. caslon smiles at him.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{hello, mrs. caslon.}
<A>__{she smiles and nods. irons. haven can feel the surcharged air. deliberately he assumes that casual manner that so burns the captain.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{captain... lieutenant...}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{mr. haven, we may not have very much around here that pleases you, but we do have a strict post regulation against brawling in the town. now would you like to explain what happened last night?}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i came here to return mrs. caslon's call.}
<A>__{iles glances sharply at mrs. caslon, and then to haven.}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(indicating a chair)}
<D>__{sit down.}
<A>__{haven sits, wincing a little. but he beams at iles, who now picks a book off the table.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{this book i have in my hand is the army register, 1882.}
<A>__{haven inspects his knuckles.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{i am now going to read from it.}
<P>__{(finds the place; reads)}
<D>__{"haven, john martin, born ohio 1852. appointed second lieutenant. promoted first lieutenant 20th infantry, march 1880; reduced in rank to 2nd lieutenant january 12, 1881."}
<A>__{he tosses the book on the table, glaring at haven.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{is that correct?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{it's the army register.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{haven, you've lost your rank once. it may very well happen again.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{to almost anybody.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{maybe if you'd let him explain... he might have a good reason.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{even a bad reason would delight me.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{what would you like to know?}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{did you pick that fight?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{those things can become very vague.}
<A>__{iles scowls to him.}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(shrewdly)}
<D>__{and where do you expect all this to get you?}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(rising wearily)}
<D>__{that is a question i prefer not to answer.}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(snaps it)}
<D>__{i think you're trying to carry your authority too far.}
<A>__{haven goes to the door, gently touching his sore jaw. at the door he turns.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{perhaps, but there's one thing, captain iles... we had an arrangement that we wouldn't meet you and i except through mrs. caslon... i think it's important to keep it that way...}
<P>__{(one more glance back)}
<D>__{and i like it better.}
<A>__{he smiles and leaves, closing the door as he goes. iles stands there frozen with rage a moment. then his face relaxes in a grim smile. he glances at stellman as he takes a cigar out and bites it off.}
