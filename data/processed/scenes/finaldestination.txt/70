<A>__{an elevator with collapsible metal door lowers into frame. pushing the door aside, alex and clear proceed into the hallway, lined with morgue green tile. stainless steel gurneys and porcelain equipment holding yellow surgical tubing and thick foot long needles sit in the corridor. a faint light spills from beneath a doorway. clear reaches out to the knob but alex quickly grabs her hand. from a cart behind them, he pulls a latex glove out of a box and snaps it on.}

<D>__{good call. very "quincy."}
<A>__{alex tries the doorknob. locked. he looks at her, defeated. clear quickly points to some mortician's tools on the cart. from it, alex produces a thin six inch needle. he inserted the tool in the lock and jimmies the doorknob. clack!}
