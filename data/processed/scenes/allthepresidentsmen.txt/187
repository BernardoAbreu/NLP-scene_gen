<A>__{woodward is stirring his morning coffee as bernstein comes in, spots him, hurries over. bernstein is maybe more excited then we've yet seen him.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{ i want you to shut up and listen to me }
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{ i haven't said anything }
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{ for the first time i'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter woodward, i got a tip. a guy called me up with a tip }
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{ someone named donald segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. the fbi knows about segretti howard hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him they interrogated him, but on account of segretti wasn't involved with the break in, they didn't follow through. but segretti did a lot of traveling he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the republicans knew what he was doing.}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{how high up, which republicans?}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{that's what we've got to find out, but segretti went to southern cal. and so did a bunch of nixon men }
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{ haldeman i know, who else?}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{dwight chapin, nixon's appointments chief he knew segretti in school. maybe i'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. what were the three theories?}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{the burglary was done by cubans or democrats or republicans.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{now the reason no one believed the republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. but segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break in.}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{so maybe watergate wasn't really about watergate maybe that was just a piece }
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{ because a year before, the republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, muskie was running ahead of nixon then. before he self destructed.}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{if he self destructed.}
<A>__{now, from the two of them }
