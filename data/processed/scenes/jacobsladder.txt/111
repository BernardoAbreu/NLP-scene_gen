<L>__{interior soho loft building evening}
<A>__{jacob runs up the stairs in a soho loft building. it is a dingy, industrial staircase, poorly lit. he reaches a door with michael's name painted on it in large black letters. he knocks loudly. there is no answer. he pounds on it. another door opens on the floor above. a head sticks out.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{you lookin' for mike?}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(panting hard)}
<D>__{where is he?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{don't know. hasn't picked his mail up in days. it's not like him.}
<A>__{jacob has a frenzied look in his eyes. he searches around the staircase and sees a pile of lumber stacked in a corner. he grabs a two by four and lunges at the door.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing?}
<A>__{jacob doesn't answer. he smashes wildly at the door until the lock flies open.}
