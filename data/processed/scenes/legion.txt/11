<A>__{it's a wonderful life playing on a crummy tv jimmy stewart as george bailey has just met clarence, his guardian angel in training. the signal rolls and snows in and out. we hear a whack, which causes the image to momentarily improve and then slowly roll back the other way.}
<C>__{clarence }
<D>__{oh, i've got to earn them and you'll help me, won't you?}
<L>__{interior paradise falls gas `n' grub day}
<A>__{bob hansen (late 40's), owner and proprietor of this fine roadside establishment, attempts to fix the old tv hanging in the corner above the counter by banging the shit out it. the restaurant itself has the kind of grungy diner charm you'd hope to find in a place last renovated in 1963. an old plastic christmas tree strung with flickering lights and tinsel occupies a lonely corner. next to that, a faded diorama of the nativity scene. the kind you might order off the shopping network. bob considers the tv with a frown. he deftly rolls an engraved silver zippo back and forth over the nicotine stained fingers of his right hand. must be a nervous habit. you can tell just by looking at the man that he's a beer drinker. behind the counter, a black man named percy walker (60's) is cooking up a storm on the grill with spectacular one handed dexterity. you do get pretty good at this sort of thing when your other hand has long been replaced by a metal hook. the dog tags around his neck tell the story. his white cook's hat has been temporarily replaced by a red santa hat.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{lord as my witness, bob, one of these days that thing's gonna hit you back.}
<A>__{whack!}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{whaddya talkin' about, percy? we got a special relationship here.}
<A>__{whack!}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{yeah, they got names for that kind a relationship.}
<A>__{the jukebox on the other side of the diner starts up with the merle haggard tune "i'm a lonesome fugitive". a stunning looking sixteen year old girl with dyed black hair and a piercing or three, is leaning seductively over the jukebox, swaying gently to the music. the headband doubling as her mini skirt reveals her knock out figure in a way that really doesn't leave much up to the imagination. she's a billboard of rebellion.}
<C>__{sandra }
<D>__{it's disgusting.}
<C>__{howard }
<D>__{you're right. it is disgusting.}
<A>__{watching the scintillating action from a booth across the diner is a conservatively dressed suburban couple. sandra and howard anderson. fish out of water.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{really, how can she go out in public wearing that?}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{i don't know. why don't we just ask her?}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{howard, don't. you'll embarrass me.}
<C>__{howard}
<P>__{(shouting across the diner)}
<D>__{audrey, honey? your mother was wondering if you got dressed this morning with the specific intention of showing your ass off to the entire world?}
<A>__{the girl who we now know as audrey anderson turns to howard with a caustic smile.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{yeah, that's cuz i woke up hoping to get double teamed by a couple of meth head truckers in the bathroom of some desert shithole.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{good thing we stopped here.}
<A>__{and with that she turns back to the jukebox. percy watches the exchange discreetly from behind the counter. loving it. howard turns back to his wife. rigid smile.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{i feel satisfied with that answer. i really do.}
<A>__{sandra buries her face in her hands.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{i'm being punished for something, i know it.}
<A>__{across the diner, audrey goes back to swaying dreamily to the music, which is suddenly overtaken by bass bumpin' hip hop.}
