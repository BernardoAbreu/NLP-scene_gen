<L>__{exterior the beach morning}
<A>__{as the blue waves of the gulf of mexico crash on the beach, the bride in her bridal gown, and bill, his tuxedo jacket off, face each other in a combat stance. the bride breeze blowing her blonde hair, holding her hanzo sword in its sheath.}
<B>__{bill}
<A>__{stares across the sand to the figure of the bride, his student, facing him at sunrise with a weapon he taught her to use. this is where all who teach combat artistry may end up. facing a frankenstein monster of their own creation. he removes his hanzo sword from its sheath with great flourish.}
<B>__{wide shot}
<A>__{the two combatants...quite far from each other...they intend to charge attack...stand in showdown stance. the bride the vengeance theme explodes on the soundtrack. she takes her combat stance. but what she doesn't do is remove her sword from its wood sheath. the fist of her left hand is wrapped around the wood sheath's center. her right empty hand, raises and makes a beckoning gesture to bill. then with a face completely devoid of emotion, says in japanese;}
<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{attack me.}
<A>__{she's facing him, sword in sheath, hand far from handle, in a standing still position, not moving a muscle of blinking an eye, staring her laser beams in bill's direction waiting for his attack. he stands in a combat position, sword raises in a combat grip, to charge her.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{that's my girl.}
<A>__{he screams a samurai scream...and charges her... she stands motionless... unblinking... watching him coming... no fear.... no expression... we go back and forth, close, wide, low.}
<B>__{till...}
<A>__{they meet... using only her left arm, with the sheathed hanzo sword in its grip, she blocks all of his blows, right arm unmoving down at her side...sort of like pai mei did to her earlier...his sword and her sheath lock together...they're close to each other, she brings up her right arm, sticks out two fingers, and hits bill on ten different pressure points on his body. then hits him straight on in the heart with her palm. his body jolts, like he's just had a heart attack...he coughs up a little blood...he looks at her. their faces are very close... the face of the cold ice woman ninja, melts away before our eyes, and the face of beatrix kiddo is filled once again with compassion.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{he taught you the ten point palm exploding heart technique?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{of course he did.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{why didn't you tell me?}
<A>__{she doesn't have an answer. she looks at him apologetically;}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{i don't know...because...i'm a...bad person.}
<A>__{he smiles at her duplicitly, and says with blood on his lips;}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{no. you're not a bad person. you're a terrific person. you're my favorite person. but every once in awhile...you can be a real cunt.}
<A>__{they smile at each other. then... bill turns his back to her... and walks five steps in the opposite direction...with each step his heart swells, on the fifth... it bursts...we hear a sound, like of a tire blowout... he falls to the beach...dead. the bride walks over to his body. she unsheaths her hanzo sword. blood lies in a pool, by bill's mouth. she dips the tip of the blade in the blood, leaving the tiniest of crimson smudges. she then removes the bill handkerchief, and wipes bill's blood from off the blade onto the white cloth. she lets the bill handkerchief drop onto his body. the jingi sword hattori hanzo created, just for her, for this purpose, has come to the end of its journey. beatrix, in a moment of enormous generosity, allows herself, one final tear, shed for her corrupter, her enemy, the father of her child,...her man. the tear is for her as well. for she's very aware she will never ever be completely any other man's woman. ex cu the hanzo blade slowly sliding into the wood sheath. ex cu the single teardrop, sliding down her cheek. the blade disappears inside the sheath. the teardrop falls of her chin. her journey, her revenge, her victory, her unfinished business, is completed. the bride exits the beach. bill doesn't.}
<B>__{series of shots end film}
<A>__{as a female voice sings a song on the soundtrack. we see the bride, get b.b. the bride and b.b. are driving away. the bride and b.b. eating in a coffee shop. the bride and b.b. in a motel room. they both wear bath towels and both of their blonde heads are wet. the bride sits behind her on the bed, combing the little one's head. the bride spooning b.b. from behind, both of them are asleep. it's the morning... b.b. sits on the motel room bed, watching saturday morning cartoons on t.v.}
