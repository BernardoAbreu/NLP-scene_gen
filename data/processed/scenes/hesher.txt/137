<A>__{dad and tj sit in the front seat. they are still angry and not speaking to each other. it is an unpleasant and uncomfortable ride. they both wear a suit and tie.}
<L>__{exterior funeral home afternoon}
<A>__{dad and tj drive into the funeral home parking lot in grandma's car. a few people are milling around.}
<L>__{interior funeral home day}
<A>__{dad and tj enter the funeral home foyer. they look like they don't know where they're supposed to go. they are greeted by the funeral director from earlier. he talks in a soft monotone whisper.}
<C>__{funeral director}
<D>__{excuse me, mr. forney, may i have a word?}
<A>__{he takes dad aside.}
<C>__{funeral director }
<D>__{i hate to have to do this here, but there's a couple of things i need to discuss with you quickly, if that's ok.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{ah, sure.}
<C>__{funeral director}
<D>__{i know that we discussed your preferences for some aspects of today's service, including your choice of the cedar casket which the insurance company had covered. unfortunately we were out of those and instead we've chosen a mahogany casket. now there is an extra charge for the mahogany which i need to clear with you before we proceed. is that ok?}
<A>__{dad looks confused. he doesn't know how he's supposed to respond.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{ah, i guess.}
<C>__{funeral director}
<D>__{ok, great, thank you. if you could just sign here.}
<A>__{the director hands dad a fancy pen and holds out a dense order form for him to sign.}
<C>__{funeral director }
<D>__{just at the bottom there.}
<A>__{dad's pen hovers. he doesn't know where he's signing.}
<C>__{funeral director }
<D>__{just here, mr. forney, just under that... yes, that's great.}
<A>__{dad signs and hands the pen back.}
<C>__{funeral director }
<D>__{now, just one other thing we have another service following yours today, we hate to do this, but we're going to have to try to get through yours as quickly as possible.}
<A>__{the funeral director's cell phone vibrates loudly on his belt. he ignores it. dad can't.}
<C>__{funeral director }
<D>__{i don't want you to feel rushed, but we are really under the pump today and i just thought i should give you the heads up. now, i notice, just looking at your order of service... (beat, thinking) ah, look, let's play it by ear. we should be fine.}
<A>__{dad looks at the funeral director, not quite sure he's hearing him right. the funeral director's phone continues to vibrate.}
<C>__{funeral director }
<D>__{ok. excuse me.}
<A>__{the funeral director walks away and answers his phone.}
