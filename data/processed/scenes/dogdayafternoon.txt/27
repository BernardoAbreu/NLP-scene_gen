<C>__{heidi}
<D>__{this gun with bullets in there, an' i go to myself, oh god, sonny! that's all i had to see, i didn't say anything.}
<A>__{she's got her door unlocked. below and on the stairs behind the cops, curious neighbors peer in...}
<L>__{interior heidi's apartment day}
<A>__{chaos out of cut rate furniture stores. full of unwashed glasses, kids' clutter. throughout, the children rush around unchecked. neighbors enter without ceremony and listen. the cops stand, trying vainly to communicate... as they enter...}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and things are adding in my head, how crazy he's been acting, and in with a bad crowd, an' i look at him, he's yellin' at the kids like a madman. so inna car i said to him, sonny, what you gonna do with the gun? you gonna shoot me and dump my body inna river or what? i was so scared of him, i never been scared of sonny never. you know, his mother says the cops was always at our house, we was always fighting. i hit him with the jack in the car once, but i only missed and hit myself, you should of seen my leg. and all he would ever do is put on his coat and go out. so they say it's sonny but i don't believe it.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{lady, you saw him. you saw his gun.}
<C>__{heidi}
<D>__{he might of done it, his body functions might of done it, but not he himself.}
