<L>__{exterior the 10 freeway day}
<A>__{the top down, the who's "baba o'riley" blasting from the stereo, vick's pristine cadillac convertible rockets down highway 10 towards nevada. at the wheel is vick, looking as sharp as his caddy in a half open shirt and mint condition aviators. sitting shotgun is the groom, doug billings, late 20's, handsome, barefoot, crunchy an all around great guy. behind vick sits alan mervish, late 20's, an anal tax attorney from connecticut, his izod shirt tucked into his khakis. he's currently applying sun screen to his forehead. next to alan is stu pryce, late 20's, former high school linebacker and lovably dimwitted father of two. he drums the back of the frontseat to the music, totally pumped, like this is his first time out of the house in years. because it is.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{dude this is already the best weekend ever!}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{stu, relax, we're still on the 10.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{oh, did i show you pictures of my kids?!}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{no, dude, show `em.}
<A>__{stu fishes pictures out of his wallet and eagerly shows them to doug in the front seat. doug is clearly the core of this group, the glue that holds these childhood friends together.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{haylee is two, and kaitlin is already four! can you believe it?!}
<C>__{doug}
<P>__{(smiling at photos)}
<D>__{how cute... good for you, man.}
<A>__{doug shows the photos to vick; he nods, impressed.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{the one on the left is gonna be a hottie. the other one, not so much.}
<A>__{stu protectively snatches the photos back, muttering:}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{jesus, dude, those are my children }
<C>__{alan}
<P>__{(re: sunscreen)}
<D>__{hey, am i rubbed in?}
<A>__{stu glances over and sees un rubbed in sunscreen all over alan's face.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{yeah, you're good.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{hey so alan, are you and becky still together?}
<A>__{but before alan can answer }
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{of course they are, doug. jesus, alan's been dating becky for 14 years. when they first met, alan had braces and soccer hair, and becky had a functioning hymen.}
<C>__{vick }
<D>__{asking alan if he's still with becky is like asking the sun if it still rises in the east.}
<A>__{the guys try not to laugh; alan scowls.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{she still pressuring you to get married?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{enh, we've moved past the pressure stage...it's more like aggravated assault stage now? like at the last wedding we went to, she threw a camera at my head, called me a closet fag, then ran out crying.}
<A>__{the guys wince, oooo.}
<C>__{alan }
<D>__{but we talked, and everything's cool now.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{maybe you could wear a helmet to doug's wedding.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{great idea, stu. thanks.}
<C>__{doug}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{so vick, how's business going?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{oh, great. yeah, i'm working on bringing the next big dessert craze to los angeles. it's gonna be huge.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{bavarian custard. we ran the numbers, and it's gonna be bigger than fro yo.}
<A>__{doug and stu nod, impressed; only alan looks skeptical.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{isn't custard like a trillion calories ?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{our plan is to open three stores in the valley and then franchise it. shares are selling fast, but i can probably squeeze you guys in...}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{yeah, man, count me in.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{me too, man! i love pudding!}
<A>__{alan just shakes his head, unbelievable.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{is this gonna do better than the hip hop label you started, vick? or the topless sushi bar? or the mobile tattoo parlor ?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{tattoo to you was an idea ahead of it's time, alan! and don't come crying to me when there's a custard cabana on every street corner in america and you didn't buy in !}
<C>__{doug}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{all right, all right, save it for the party...}
<A>__{vick and alan quiet. stu is still drumming the seat.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{dude! i can't believe i get to party all night, and then, tomorrow ...i get to sleep in! it's almost too much! and fyi, if anyone gets really drunk and craps themself, just let me know, i can have you cleaned up and partying again in under three minutes. no joke. i am a master of stool removal...}
<A>__{they rocket off into the desert, laughing...}
