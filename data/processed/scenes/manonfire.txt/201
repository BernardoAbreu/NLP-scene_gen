<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{close up: tazinari hands being cuff flexed and tied to side view mirrors of the coupe deville. cut back to see tazinari, naked other than his calvin klein skivvies, spread eagled across the grill of the car, butt forward (reminiscent of 'the woods scene' in deliverance) creasy rips down his calvins. cu of tazinari's face winces with either pain or extreme discomfort.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{that's not my dick. that's the barrel of your own gun. shoved up your own ass.}
<A>__{as tazinari reacts...}
<C>__{creasy }
<D>__{.44 magnum. now, how's your hearing?}
<A>__{we hear the click of the trigger being cocked back.}
<C>__{tazinari}
<D>__{please, don't...}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{it's all up to you, commandante. tell me about you and 'the dreamer'.}
<A>__{creasy puts a tape recorder on the hood and presses the record button.}
<C>__{tazinari}
<D>__{i don't know him. i saw the opportunity and got lucky.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{lucky how?}
<C>__{tazinari}
<D>__{that he used policemen. that you killed them, it made it a police matter. the ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{tazinari}
<D>__{and i had my men ready.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{you stole the drop.}
<A>__{more flashes: as we see this happen. pov from opposite side of the bridge. pov from the drop car. see the money drop get ambushed by unknown faces. 'the nephew' gets shot. the kidnapper running the show sounds like woody woodpecker, high pitched squeaky voice.}
<C>__{creasy }
<D>__{you done it before?}
<A>__{tazinari doesn't answer. creasy gives the magnum a tweak.}
<C>__{tazinari}
<D>__{yes. many times.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{o.k. so tell me more.}
<C>__{tazinari}
<D>__{there was no ten million dollars.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{the ransom was ten.}
<C>__{tazinari}
<D>__{two and a half. that's how much there was.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{don't lie to me!}
<C>__{tazinari}
<D>__{two and a half! the rest was paper! strips of paper!}
<A>__{flashback: tazinari, in his office, sifting through the paper.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{maybe your men stole from you.}
<C>__{tazinari}
<D>__{no. whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{who gave the bags to ramos?}
<C>__{tazinari}
<D>__{his lawyer. jordan kalfus.}
<A>__{flashback: ramos house. bags of cash being switched from the mercedes with the flat tire to the 2nd mercedes in the garage. see that jordan does the switch, four bags on the floor.}
