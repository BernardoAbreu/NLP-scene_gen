<D>__{...you son of a }
<C>__{amy }
<D>__{norville!}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{huh?!}
<A>__{he looks stupidly about, the shoulders of his coat down around his elbows. he sees amy rushing up.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{...oh, it's you! lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{oh norville, i }
<A>__{norville's attention has already left her. he looks for the missing bartender.}
<C>__{norville}
<P>__{(swaying)}
<D>__{barman! set'm up, fella!}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{norville, i'm sorry, i... i tried to tell you... so many times... it's hard to admit when you've been wrong. if you could just... find it in your heart to to give me another chance }
<C>__{norville}

<C>__{norville}
<D>__{aww, what's the difference. i'm all washed up... when you're dead, ya stay dead... hey, fella!}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{well that just about does it! i've seen norville barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and i've seen norville barnes the self important heel, but i've never seen norville barnes the quitter, and i don't like it!}
<A>__{she starts pumping her arms, slowly chanting.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{...fight on, fight on, dear old muncie.}
<A>__{she steps back off the stool. norville watches her dully, his head swaying.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{...fight on, hoist the gold and blue; you'll be tattered, torn and hurtin' once 'the munce' is done with you! goooooo eagles!}
<A>__{she looks hopefully for some effect, but after staring at her for a slack jawed beat norville can only bring out:}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{you lied to me! i can't believe you lied to me! a muncie girl!}
<A>__{he lurches off his stool toward the door. watching him, despair fights with confusion on amy's face.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{but norville... i...}
<A>__{she realizes that, though shattered, he is still the simple innocent she loved }
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{... oh, norville!}
<A>__{ and bursts into tears. two loud revelers reel into frame, one of them uncurling a blow beeper at the weeping amy.}
<D>__{reveler #1 happy newby newby new! reveler #2 1959 we dig you the most!}
