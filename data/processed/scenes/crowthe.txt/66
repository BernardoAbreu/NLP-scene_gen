<A>__{as t bird enters. the room is organized around a long meeting table and flavored with a taste of everything illegal: drug paraphernalia, weapons. across the table are a couple of sentries like the one that admits t bird to the room. track past them to a lank haired silhouette as he turns away from a windowshade, backlit by showtime's exterior neon. this is top dollar. who looks like a johnny winter acid casualty but is deadly cold, definitely the man in charge.}
