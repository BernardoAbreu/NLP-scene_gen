<LOC>__{EXT. WOODED HILLSIDE. DAY.}
<ACTION>__{We see the drawn face of a young woman. Camera tracks with her as she runs through the thick woods. She is exerting herself heavily as she moves up a steep hillside. She looks behind her quickly, and continues. ANGLE, we see a young man, and then another, running through the woods, out of breath. They are dressed in filthy BDU's, and show several days growth of beard. The leader stops for a moment, and looks around. The two men separate. ANGLE, the  young woman, who has come to a small ledge, over a ravine.  She stops, panting, and bends over, to attempt to catch her  breath. She looks around, and looks back, her back to a steep  wall, a steep drop before her. ANGLE, the first young man, having come up to the spot vacated by the young woman. In the BG we see his colleague. He looks down, and sees movement in the brush below him, in the ravine. He starts to descend, and then looks up. ANGLE, the young woman, pulling herself up the steep rockface. The young man regains the ledge and looks up. Camera takes him around a bend in the ledge. Standing here we discover ROBERT SCOTT. He is somewhat older than the two men, he is very fit, also dressed in filthy BDU's. He is making a note in a small notebook, which he closes. Now, the two men look across the ravine at the young woman, seen disappearing over a ridge.}
<CHAR>__{SCOTT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(quietly)}
<DIAL>__{...you better catch her...}
<ACTION>__{The man looks around, and begins climbing up the rockface behind him, pulling himself up, hand over hand by the roots of trees. Several feet up, he falls on his back. He tries to work himself to his knees and winces in pain. He looks to Scott for help.}
<CHAR>__{SCOTT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{...your Dad's napping on the sofa, your Mom's watching Let's Make A Deal, and God is Dead. What do you expect me to do...?}

<CHAR>__{SCOTT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There's always a way...Don't You tell me there's no way...}
<ACTION>__{A pause, as the man tries again to get to his feet. Scott looks up at the young woman on top of the ridge and gives her a "hold" gesture. She stops, at his command. Scott nods, as if to himself, and then kicks the young man in the ribs. The man starts, his eyes grow, and he gets to his feet.}
<CHAR>__{SCOTT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How 'bout that? That's called 'Adrenaline'. You said you Wanted In.}
<ACTION>__{He moves into the now-standing young man, and hits him, not heavily, but convincingly, several times.}
<CHAR>__{SCOTT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This is where you get in. The mugger don't care. The shooter don't care...get up...Or I will beat you to death on this fucken hill...Now: you better Catch her...}
<ACTION>__{He motions with his head. In the BG we see the young woman nod, and begin running again. We see her, for a moment, breast a hill, and disappear again... ANGLE, on the young man, as he looks at Scott, empty, now, of self-pity, as if he just realized something.}
<CHAR>__{SCOTT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(responding to his look. As if to say "That's right.")}
<DIAL>__{There's nothing but the mission...}
<ACTION>__{The young man begins to climb the rockface. HOLD on Scott for a moment.}
<LOC>__{INT. TRAINING FACILITY. DAY.}
<ACTION>__{A large, hand-painted sign hangs on the cinderblock wall of the rough building. It reads:}
<DIAL>__{These are the precincts of pain. A goddess lives here. Her name is Victory.}
<ACTION>__{In front of the sign walks the young woman we saw earlier. She is exhausted, she has a towel wrapped around her neck. Camera takes her to Scott, who is holding a cup of coffee, and making notes in the small notebook we saw earlier. She stands, waiting, as she finishes his note.}
<CHAR>__{SCOTT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well done.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG WOMAN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(JACKIE BLACK)}
<DIAL>__{A signal honor to work with you, sir.}
<CHAR>__{SCOTT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thank you, Sergeant.}
<ACTION>__{He starts away from her, and she raises her hand slightly, to indicate she has something more to say. He turns back to her.}
<CHAR>__{JACKIE BLACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sir: Day or Night. Black or White. You reach out for me. "Black, Jaqueline A. US 24191489."}
<CHAR>__{SCOTT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll remember, Sergeant.}
<ACTION>__{She nods, and walks off. Scott walks toward a mess tent. He is joined by George Blane, a very military-looking figure of an older man. He wears an informal fatigue outfit, mismatched jacket and trousers, without insignia. Scott is greeted by him, as they walk toward the mess tent. Scott shows the notebook to Blane, and Blane refers from the notebook to what we see are a group of eighty young men, in the mess tent, two of them the men we saw on the hill. Blane takes the notebook and walks off, as Scott enters the mess tent. ANGLE HIS POV, Scott enters the tent. Several of the young men react to him. He nods to them. Among them, we see the young man Scott berated on the hill, who rises and comes over to Scott. ANGLE, on Scott, who sits, as a uniformed man brings him a tinfoil tray with some food on it. Scott takes out a stiletto from his pocket, presses a button and the blade emerges. He begins to use it to cut up his meat. The young man from the hill, Anton, stands sheepishly near Scott, till Scott turns, acknowledging him. Anton takes a card out of his pocket, the size of a credit card, old, creased cardboard: It reads, "Rogers Rangers, Rules for Engagement. 1782". There is a line drawing of a man with a musket, and we read, on the card, beneath it, boldtype rules for fighting guerilla style. Written on the card, in old faded ink, "SGT. Anton, M. US. 3149584, United States Special Forces." The young man (Anton) shows the card to Scott.}

<DIAL>__{What's this then?}
<CHAR>__{ANTON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It was my father's, sir.}
<CHAR>__{SCOTT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He carry it Over There?}
<ACTION>__{As they speak, we see, in an insert, the printed rules - "Dated 1759". "Rule 4: Tell the truth about what you see and what you do - there is an army depending on us for correct information. You can lie all you please when you tell other folks about the Rangers, but don't never lie to a Ranger or an Officer".}

<DIAL>__{Yes, sir.}

<DIAL>__{Yes, sir. He did.}
<CHAR>__{SCOTT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(nods. Pause)}
<DIAL>__{Well, so.}
<ACTION>__{Scott pauses again. As he looks at the young man, who is obviously unable to express his gratitude, and sense of occasion.}
<CHAR>__{SCOTT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You carry that card, son. It might save your life.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(Anton nods)}
<DIAL>__{...You could use it to light a fire, or something...}

<CHAR>__{SCOTT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(rising, as he gives}
<DIAL>__{the Ranger card back}
<DIAL_PAR>__{to Anton)}
<DIAL>__{You never met me. You've been up for a week. You're seeing Snakes...}
<ACTION>__{The exhausted men come to their feet, and into a line. They are happy, and joking with one another. In the BG we see those who failed the course, sitting apart, file onto a bus which has just pulled up. ANGLE on a young man, who looks out of the window. ANGLE HIS POV. Twenty or so similarly exhausted men, with dufflebags, are being shuffled onto the bus. ANGLE, on the young man, Anton, as he exits the tent, who stands next to Scott, outside the tent. Scott stands next to an old, but pristine Mustang Cobra. He withdraws a small dufflebag from the front seat, and looks up to see Anton standing next to him.}
<CHAR>__{ANTON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(looking after the departing, failed men)}
<DIAL>__{...I can't imagine how they live with it...}
<ACTION>__{ANGLE on Scott. As he thinks a very brief moment, as if reluctant to become philosophical, and then turns back to Anton.}
<CHAR>__{SCOTT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Make sure you can't imagine it, cause, if you can, it's just one step to doing it.}
<ACTION>__{Anton shakes his head, sadly, at the spectacle of the failed men.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(as he glances down at his clipboard)}
<DIAL>__{Congratulations on completion of this evolution. I know you would probably like some sleep, but I do not think you'd mind sparing ten minutes for Induction.}
<ACTION>__{The camera pans over the smiling faces of the eight very proud young men. ANGLE on Blane and Scott, off to the side. Beyond them, we see the bus holding the failed candidates, filling up.}
<CHAR>__{BLANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thank you, Bobby.}

<DIAL>__{Grossler, Anton...}
<ACTION>__{These two men steps forward. ANGLE, on Anton, nodding to himself at the proudest moment of his life. ANGLE, CU Scott, looking at him. Camera takes Blane and Scott into a cinderblock building which houses a shooting range. We see various housefronts, and storefronts, and targets. A long table along one wall holds a coffee urn. Blane draws two cups of coffee. Through the open door we see Anton and Grossler, smiling, entering the building. Anton comes into the room, and smiles at Scott. We see Scott look away, sadly. He shares a look with Blane, drains his coffee cup, crumples it, throws it away. Blane gestures to Scott, meaning, "Shall we begin?" Scott hesitates for a moment, and then nods.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{FOCUS.}
<ACTION>__{ANGLE, on Scott, in the BG, as Blane steps forward to address the two candidates.}
<CHAR>__{BLANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{Only one of you may join the unit. The first man through that door will be inducted.}

<CHAR>__{SCOTT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to himself, quietly)}
<DIAL>__{...yeah...you wanted to know the 'secret knowledge'...}
<ACTION>__{CU Scott  as he looks, interrogating the   two men, weighing them, as  they look at each other. Beat.   Grossler starts to advance  on Anton, in a fighting crouch.   Scott gestures to the Aide  that that was what he wanted to   see. The Aide lets Scott out of the back door.}
<LOC>__{EXT. CINDERBLOCK BUILDING. DAY.}
<ACTION>__{Scott, showered, in civilian clothes, a lumberjacket and jeans, comes out of the building, carrying a small, yellow duffle-bag. He opens the trunk. He takes the yellow bag, and puts it into the trunk which we now see contains woodworking tools - old levels and planes and saws. He closes the trunk. We see the young woman from the first sequence, now in civilian clothes, conferring with a colleague. She nods at him, and he responds. As he starts to get into the car. A squad of exhausted men is marching past. As they come to a halt one of the men turns in the direction of Scott.}

<LOC>__{EXT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER. DUSK.}
<ACTION>__{A young worker in a hardhat, by a large gravel pit, at which we find several earthmovers, idle. He is standing by a high chainlink fence topped with barbed wire. ANGLE HIS POV. Some half-mile away, the Mustang, heading in his direction on a rough road. The young worker opens the lock on the chainlink fence and swings it open. We see a sign "McGarrity Construction Company" on the gate. The young man walks back toward a construction trailer. We see a red light blinking on a telephone on top of a littered desk. The young worker enters the trailer hurriedly, and opens a cabinet which we see contains several assault rifles, and grenades. Another phone, its red light blinking, is found in the cabinet. The young worker picks up this phone quickly.}

<ACTION>__{We see his face grow serious, as he begins to write on a pad.}
<LOC>__{INT. MUSTANG. DAY.}
<ACTION>__{Scott, driving, comes around a bend. ANGLE HIS POV. The construction trailer up ahead. We see the young worker come out of the trailer, and stand in the road giving a "Stop" signal to the car. ANGLE EXT. THE CAR. We see Scott bring the Mustang to a stop, and get, inquisitively, out of the car. We see the young worker run up to him and hand him a sheet of paper. Scott takes the paper and begins to read. He looks up, to ask a question of the young worker. We see the worker begin to respond, his body language saying "That's all I know." As he starts to speak his words are drowned out by the sound of a helicopter. Scott looks up. ANGLE HIS POV. A helicopter, flying low. ANGLE INT. THE HELICOPTER. A man in civilian clothes points out Scott, on the ground, to the Pilot. Through the canopy we see Scott and the construction canopy down below. The helicopter goes into a tight turn. ANGLE Scott. Above him, the helicopter goes into its turn, and begins to descend in a field some fifty yards away. ANGLE, the sheet of paper Scott holds. Is reads: "All hands." Over the throbbing of the helicopter, we see Scott giving directions about the car, to the young worker. Camera takes Scott to the trunk, which he opens, and from which he retrieves his gym bag. He hands the keys to the young worker, and takes off, running, to the helicopter. ANGLE, on Scott, as he is pulled up aboard, and the helicopter takes off. ANGLE, over the worker, watching the helicopter disappear.}
<LOC>__{INT. HELICOPTER. NIGHT.}
<ACTION>__{Scott, asleep. As the helicopter banks low over the Charles River and Harvard College. A Crewman shakes him awake. ANGLE, EXT: the helicopter descends into the field of a football stadium. A black suburban is waiting.}
<LOC>__{EXT. BOATHOUSE. CHARLES RIVER. NIGHT.}
<ACTION>__{Seen through the windshield of a car. ANGLE, a black, government Suburban pulls outside the boathouse. We see scaffolding being erected outside the main entrance. Scott and several types in suits get out of the Suburban, and proceed toward the door, over which is hung a large, paint-spattered drape. A sign on a stanchion reads "Temporarily Closed For Repairs". ANGLE, INT. THE BOATHOUSE. The group pushes through the drape, beyond which we see several men in suits, holding assault rifles. An older government type, MILLER, followed by an AIDE, walks up to meet the group, the Aide motions to the armed guards that Scott is to be admitted, that he is "okay". Miller gestures to Scott that it will just be a moment. The Aide hands Scott a sheaf of papers, and leads him through the boathouse. We see the long skiffs up on their rests, the Charles River beyond. ANGLE on Scott. As Scott looks through the papers. Around him we see communications equipment being hurriedly assembled. ANGLE INSERT. The top sheet shows a color photo of a phenomenally lovely redheaded girl in her teens. As Scott talks, he leafs through the sheets to reveal several photos of her and a man, obviously her father, holding her hand. One is a print of a glossy magazine article.}

ANGLE on Scott, as he gestures to Miller to look through the glass, at the young man being interrogated, who is now seen to be wiping his brow, and shaking his head. The young man tries to take a sip of coffee, and spills it, inadvertently, down his shirtfront. Scott exchanges a glance with Miller, and walks into the equipment room, to the interrogation. The man being interrogated, the government type, Gaines, is in his early thirties. He is sweating and obviously frightened. An Aide comes and stands by Scott.}

THE OWL. Rest Stop. A run-down rural gas station, restaurant. Off to the side we see the cruiser coming down the road. As a roughly-dressed man runs out of the restaurant, carrying a full paper bag in his hand. The Cruiser, unseen by the man, pulls up to the gas pump, and the Trooper starts to get out of the driver's seat. When gunfire erupts from the restaurant. People are shooting at the fleeing man. A man opens the door of the restaurant and fires at the roughly-dressed man in a very urban leather jacket, who returns fire. Glass breaks in the windows of the restaurant. The roughly-dressed man runs to his car, an 80's Pontiac, parked near the pumps. The man in the doorway fires again, and the windshield of the Pontiac blows out and a tire bursts. The roughly-dressed man returns fire, and the man in the doorway falls. The roughly-dressed man turns to see that the Trooper is out of his Cruiser, and is about to fire at him. The roughly-dressed man drops his satchel, and fires at the Trooper, who falls. The paper bag has fallen to the ground and burst, and currency is spilling out of it, and being taken on the wind. The roughly-dressed man frantically begins to try to scoop it up and into his jacket. ANGLE CU on this man, who we now see is SCOTT. He stands around, and moves to the fallen Trooper. He strips the keys from the Trooper's keyring, and looks up. Feeling someone gazing at him. ANGLE HIS POV. In the car, two convicts, a Heavyset Man and ELI ASSANI, the middle-eastern man we saw in the mugshot. He is holding his neck, which is bleeding copiously. We see the back window behind him, shattered by gunfire. ANGLE on Scott, who gets into the car, takes the keys he took from the Trooper, and begins screaming off down the highway. LOW ANGLE, showing the car taking a turn vastly too fast, the car careens up on two wheels, rights itself, fishtails, corrects, and disappears in the distance. ANGLE INT. THE CAR.

Scott steps toward him and spits at him, full in the face. The man with the knife recoils for a moment, and Scott disarms him, throws him viciously to the concrete floor, and stomps on him. Scott bends to pick up the knife the man has dropped, and turns to face the other man. As he does so, he slips on what we see is a large pool of oil on the floor. He goes down heavily.
