<L>__{exterior cider house evening}
<A>__{the pickers all sit down to supper around a picnic table. homer with mr. rose, rose rose, and the other black pickers. mr. rose takes an apple from a bowl on the table. then he pulls out a knife and opens it in one fluid motion; he's so fast, the knife seems to come out of nowhere. he begins to peel the apple. homer eyes mr. rose, but mr. rose's focus is riveted to his apple and the long, perfect strand of peel dangling from it.}
<C>__{mr. rose}

<D>__{now, now we all got names, sensible or not.}
