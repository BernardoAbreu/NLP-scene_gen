<A>__{ryan stands in the wings. he takes a breath, then steps out in front of a sea of people. the goalquest xx stage is like nothing we've seen yet. large and professional. blue banners hang from the ceiling. digital projectors show ryan's headshot what's in your backpack? ryan sets the back pack on a table and quickly unzips it. a breath.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{last year, i flew three hundred fifty thousand miles. the moon is only two fifty.}
<A>__{a long beat. uncomfortable. ryan looks at the back pack.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{imagine for a second that you're carrying a backpack... i want you to feel the straps on your shoulders... you feel them?}
<A>__{ryan isn't feeling them. he is not inspired. he isn't believable. he's barely even there.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{now, i want you to pack it with all the stuff you have in your life. start with the little things.}
<A>__{ryan is trying, but he can't find the will to do this.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{the... um... the stuff in drawers and on shelves.}
<A>__{ryan takes a beat. he just stares at the backpack and thinks about all the things he has removed from it... and then...}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{and with that, ryan leaves the stage. handlers try to figure out what ryan is doing. the host runs for the mic.}
<C>__{goalquest host}
<P>__{(to ryan)}
<D>__{what the fuck are you doing?}
<P>__{(to crowd)}
<D>__{okay, everyone just relax. we'll have your next guest out in a sec.}
