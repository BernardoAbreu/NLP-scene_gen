<A>__{dyson walks to a stainless steel cabinet and opens it. inside is a small artifact in a sealed container of inert gas. it a ceramic rectangle, about the size of a domino, the color of liver. it has been shattered, painstakingly reconstructed and mounted on a metal frame. dyson removes the artifact, it its insert gas, and sets it on a specially designed cart. he handles it like the turin shroud. dyson closes the cabinet. turns to the one next to it. opens its door. in this cabinet is a larger object... an intricate metal hand}
<B>__{and forearm.}
<A>__{at the elbow, the metal is twisted and crushed. but the forearm and hand are intact. its metal surface scorched and discolored, it stands upright in a vacuum flask, as if saluting. this is all that remains of the terminator sarah destroyed. dyson stares at it, lost in thought. the he closes the cabinet, blacking out frame.}
