<A>__{starks and jackie are leaving the morgue, when starks spots damon, now hardly a hair of the bully he was before. damon stares at him curiously; starks glares back furiously.}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{you folks ain't supposed to be down here.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{we were just leaving.}
<A>__{damon doesn't take his eyes off starks.}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{do i know you from somewhere?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you may have known my father, william starks.}
<A>__{damon smiles, remembering...}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{that's right! goddamn, you're the spitting image. i didn't know he had a son.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{he didn't either. damon [with a dirty laugh] i will be damned. he musta been 12 when he had you. [beat] you could be his ghost.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{did you know my father?}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{oh yeah, sure. he killed a cop, right?}
<A>__{starks looms strangely over damon in this exchange.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you wouldn't happen to know how he died, would you? damon [slightly apprehensive] no, i don't. i just remember them finding his body.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you don't know any more, damon? damon [shocked] how'd you know my name?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{my father used to talk about you.}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{oh yeah, what'd he say?}
<A>__{damon's eyes betray his unease.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{he said you were a sadistic fuck that belonged in jail.}
<A>__{damon is shocked, and cowed. so much that he shakes as he looks for his bearings.}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{look here, i don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{that's too bad.}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{i thought you said you never knew your father.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i didn't. [beat] did you have anything to do with his death?}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about, man. i swear. this is some weird shit you're telling me... and i don't know how come you're doing it.}
<A>__{starks starts to see a shaking man who stands confused and distraught before him.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{he died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. someone had to have given him it.}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{i never touched your father! i swear!}
<A>__{damon's eyes are filled with dishonesty, tears and a craven fear. starks leans in closer to damon as he remembers...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you know something, damon? you're like a mule. you're real stubborn. but there's ways of fixin' that. all you need is a good stick. [beat] here's your stick. live with it.}
<A>__{starks looks like he could easily bash damon's head against the wall, but instead he lets it go and walks away.}
