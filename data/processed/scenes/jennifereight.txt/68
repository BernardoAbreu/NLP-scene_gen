<L>__{68: interior office. police station. night.}
<A>__{massive close up of the lock. a weird looking tool goes in and another follows it. this bastard ain't easy even for an expert. the frame widens to reveal berlin. he shuffles picks in a wall et on top of the cabinet. was that a noise somewhere? he stops to listen. wipes cold sweat away. only thieves and foxes about. a final twist and the lock delivers. several dozen manilla col ored files from which to choose. a pair of folders titled jenn ifer travel to the desk. the first is full of press cuttings & some gruesome looking snaps. next file and this one looks more interesting? a notebook full of random questions answers comm ents. a list of ships and sailing times. "must follow this up" underlined twice. "can't over estimate importance." also under lined. lists of numbers. street numbers? vehicle numbers? what ever they might be is history because the neon just flashed on. taylor stands in the doorway. the surprise is mutual. the play one sided. this is already taylor's game. smokes his cigarette. berlin is up to elbows in the jam jar and up to him to explain.}

<A>__{as he exits he tosses a bunch of keys. they crash uselessly on to the desk. berlin looks like he couldn't get a fuck with mud.}
