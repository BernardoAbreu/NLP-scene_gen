<L>__{exterior intersection that moment night}
<A>__{a delivery truck hits the brakes and screeches to a stop, two feet away from batman's head. he doesn't move. pedestrians are already gawking and pointing as the driver climbs out and peers down at the inert caped figure lying face down in the street:}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{what the hell is this?}
<A>__{cars are backed up, due to the panic in gotham square a few blocks over. horns are honking. a traffic cop marches over }
<C>__{traffic cop}
<D>__{awright, what's the problem here?}
<P>__{(spotting batman)}
<D>__{jesus.}
<A>__{he tries to clear the crowd away. a full fledged gridlock is forming around the prostrate batman. the cop blows his whistle, tries to maintain order as two unifonned patrolmen rush up to join him. they manage to roll the unconscious batman over on his back. the assembled cops stare down at the mask, the scuffed body armor. still waxy, they finger the guns in their holsters...}
<C>__{patrolman}
<D>__{good god. cowan get to the car radio the commissioner!!}
<A>__{by now there must be two hundred people in the intersection, all surging forward to get a look. more cops are arriving to beat them back.}
<C>__{traffic cop}
<D>__{is he dead? what do we do?}
<C>__{patrolman}
<D>__{the mask. get the mask off.}
<A>__{they hunker down over batman. one of them tugs at his mask but the helmet like cowl doesn't want to give way. he feels around }
<C>__{traffic cop}
<D>__{some kinda seam here on the neck...}
<A>__{the patrolman nods okay, and the cop tugs at a velcro like fastening under batman's chin. the instant it comes open a burst of fine green mist spews forth from concealed jets in the gold and black bat emblem, and the cops reel backward, shrieking, gasping for breath and clewing at their eyes. booby trap they've just been maced. one of the onlooking cops steps back in horror and confusion. on impulse, he draws his gun and fires twice at batman. the body jerks and the bullets ricochet off }
<C>__{traffic cop}
<D>__{don't shoot, you idiot. the crowd }
<A>__{before he can finish, a black boot kicks the gun out of the onlooking cop's hand. batman is back among the living. sirens blare as he spins and rolls into a crouch lashing out with elbows and knees driving the cops back fuck the crowd. two more cops pull their guns and open fire in absolute panic. batman slams backward into the delivery truck and crumples to the ground. as he falls, he grabs a couple of smoke capsules from his belt and flings them to the pavement. seconds later, a thick cloud of black smoke is spreading through the intersection. batman emerges into the midst of the crowd weaving in and out among the stalled vehicles }
