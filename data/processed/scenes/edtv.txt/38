<A>__{it says "the following is unedited, unscripted, and unrehearsed. it is the real life of one american citizen named ed pekurny." the logo fades away and we see ed, in bed, sleeping. his alarm rings and he wakes up. he's groggy from sleep. instinctively, he begins scratching his balls. as he does, it hits him that this is not a normal morning. he looks up and sees two steady cam guys at the foot of his bed, aiming their cameras at him. ed, then, looks at his hand on his balls. gently, he moves his hand away.}
