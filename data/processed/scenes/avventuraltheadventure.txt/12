<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{out on the yacht, patrizia is completing her puzzle. only a few pieces are missing but the area to be filled in is a very difficult one. raimondo, who has grown impatient over patrizia's long and tedious concentration, exclaims:}
<C>__{raimondo}
<D>__{you've made some mistake there with the bushes... that's why you can't finish it.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{take it easy, raimondo. why are you getting so impatient?}
<A>__{claudia's voice is heard, calling out from the shore.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{patrizia! ...}
<A>__{patrizia raises her eyes and gives a quick, casual glance at the porthole. raimondo immediately takes the hint that she would like him to get up and see what claudia wants. so he goes out to the deck where he sees claudia calling from the shore.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{is anna there?}
<C>__{raimondo}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{he goes over to the cabin, and looking through the portholes, calls out anna's name. but there is no answer, so he returns to the side of the boat and shouts back.}
<C>__{raimondo}
<D>__{she's not here.}
