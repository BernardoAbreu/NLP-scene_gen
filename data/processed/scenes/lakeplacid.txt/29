<P>__{(slowing the boat)}
<D>__{i thought i saw...}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{it looks like a branch.}
<A>__{he leans over to grab something floating in the water. looks like a branch. he lifts it up, revealing it to be an antler. connected to the severed head of a moose. keough, seeing it as he lifts it, screams, throwing it. it hits kelly and she screams, a blood curdling scream, as the head hits the floor of the boat with a heavy thud. kelly rears back, still screaming, and belts keough in the shoulder.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{hey!!}

<D>__{ma'am!}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{don't throw heads at me,}
<P>__{(to jack)}
