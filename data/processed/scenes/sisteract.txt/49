<A>__{a stone room that is very medieval looking. one wall is divided into stalls by wooden partitions. in each stall is a nun, standing beneath a crude shower head that releases a thin stream of lukewarm water. we see only the nuns' heads and shoulders. still sleepy, christy leans against the wall of her stall, her eyes closed. lost in thought, she begins singing softly to herself.}
