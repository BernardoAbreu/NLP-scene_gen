<L>__{exterior kimberly's house day}
<A>__{as kimberly pulls into her driveway, she's surprised to see a strange car parked there. then thomas, wearing street clothes, peers through the front window of the house. he guiltily backs away as kimberly gets out.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{i tried calling last night but your father }
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{evan shaeffer's dead.}
<A>__{thoma s nods and leans against the large glass windows that reflect the sky behind them.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{i know. i've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. we're all meeting at my apartment tonight.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{then you believe all this?? that death is working off a list?}
<A>__{thomas hesitates before answering.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{i didn't. until i was dispatched to clean up one of the flight 180 survivors.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{clean up? i don't...}
<A>__{suddenly through the reflection of the window glass, kimberly sees hundreds of pigeons dive bomb her at once! like a scene out of the birds, kimberly must duck and cover as the pigeons assault her from every angle. but when kimberly turns away from the reflection, toward the actual pigeons, they're gone. all in her head.}
<C>__{ki mberly}
<D>__{did you see that??}
<A>__{thomas, concerned for her, saw nothing.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{pigeons... it's a sign! if clear's right about the order, then nora and tim are going to be attacke d by pigeons!}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{i'm not following you }
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{they're next on the list. we have to find them.}
