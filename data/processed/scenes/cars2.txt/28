<L>__{interior bathroom outside the stall}
<A>__{rod redline is in bad shape. he backs away, betrays a look of concern. he's in trouble here. acer burns rubber, ready to finish him off. just as he shifts into drive mater's stall door kicks open, knocking acer out. mater jumps out, face to face grem.}
<C>__{mater}
<P>__{(out of breath)}
<D>__{whatever you do, i would not go in there.}
