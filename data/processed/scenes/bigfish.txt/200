<L>__{interior hospital room night}
<A>__{edward sleeps peacefully, just an oxygen tube under his nose. there are no beeping monitors, no blinking lights. it's mercifully quiet. sandra squeezes will's hand tightly. she's holding herself together, but it's been a tough day. dr. bennett has just gone through the details for the third time.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{i don't suppose one of us could stay with him. in case he...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{in case he wakes up, one of us should be there.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i will stay. why don't you go home with josephine and i will stay tonight.}
<C>__{sandra}
<P>__{(to dr. bennett)}
<D>__{that's okay?}
<C>__{dr. bennett}
<D>__{it's fine.}
<C>__{sandra}
<P>__{(to will)}
<D>__{you'll call if...}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i will. i will call.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{mom, do you want some time with dad?}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{yes. thank you.}
<A>__{a nod, then will holds the door for dr. bennett and josephine as they leave. sandra is alone in the room with her husband. she neatens his hair. holds his hand. as she kisses his fingers, she tweaks her chin with them his signature move.}
