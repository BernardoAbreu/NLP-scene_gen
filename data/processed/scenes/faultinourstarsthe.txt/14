<L>__{ext outside the church later}
<A>__{hazel waits for her mom's car to appear. across the parking lot, she sees isaac going at it with a redhead, monica (17), sucking face like there's no tomorrow against the door of her green pontiac firebird. between kisses, we can hear:}
<C>__{isaac monica}
<A>__{always. always. and hazel hears:}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{literally.}
<A>__{hazel turns to find the beautiful boy, augustus, standing right next to her.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i thought we were in a church basement but apparently we were literally in the heart of jesus.}
<A>__{hazel smiles.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{someone should probably tell him, don't you think? jesus? seems kinda dangerous keeping all these kids with cancer in your heart.}
<A>__{gus laughs.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{hazel.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{no your full name?}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{hazel grace lancaster.}
<A>__{gus nods to himself, smiles. still fixated on her.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i didn't say anything.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{why are you looking at me like that?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{because you're beautiful.}
<A>__{hazel is taken aback. no one's ever said that to her before.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i enjoy looking at beautiful people and i decided a while back not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence. particularly given that, as you so astutely pointed out, we're all gonna die pretty soon.}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm not beaut }
<A>__{a cute young girl walks past them.}
<C>__{young girl}
<D>__{hey gus.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{hey alisa.}
<A>__{hazel isn't surprised that other girls know gus. of course they do. she turns back towards isaac and monica pawing at each other. she hears:}
<C>__{isaac monica}
<A>__{always. always.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{what's with the "always?"}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{"always" is their thing. they'll "always" love each other and whatnot. must have texted "always" to each other at least four million times this year.}
<A>__{they continue to watch the show. it's pretty gross. isaac squeezes monica's breast like a clown horn.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{he's gotta be hurting her boob.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{let's watch a movie.}
<A>__{hazel is again surprised.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{oh. um. uh...}
<P>__{(yes!)}
<D>__{sure. yeah. i'm... pretty free this week }
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{no i mean now.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{hmm?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{what do you mean "now?"}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i've got a car.}
<A>__{he shrugs. hazel has never seen someone so confident.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{you could be an axe murderer.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{there is that possibility.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{come on hazel grace... take a risk.}
<A>__{as hazel mulls this over, gus reaches into his pocket and pulls out, of all things, a pack of cigarettes! hazel is in disbelief. he flips the box open, puts a cigarette between his lips.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{oh my god. oh. my. god. you're kidding right?}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{you just ruined the whole thing!}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{whole thing?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{what, you think that's cool? oh you idiot! there's always a hamartia, isn't there? and yours is even though you had freaking cancer you give money to a corporation for the chance to acquire even more cancer!? ugh. and you were doing so well.}
<A>__{as she rants, gus continues to look at her with that smile on his face. hazel does not find it so amusing.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{let me tell you... not being able to breathe? sucks. totally sucks.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{hamartia?}
<A>__{hazel folds her arms and turns away from him.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{a fatal flaw.}
<A>__{gus takes a beat and then moves to face her, the smile still etched on his face.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{they don't hurt you unless you light them.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{sorry?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i've never lit one.}
<A>__{hazel turns back to him.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{it's a metaphor. see? you put the thing that kills you between your teeth. but you don't give it the power to do the killing.}
<A>__{hazel is floored. and impressed.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{metaphor.}
<A>__{gus holds her gaze. and it's at this point frannie pulls up.}
<C>__{frannie}
<D>__{hi sweetheart. ready for some "model?"}
<A>__{hazel looks at gus, cigarette dangling from his lips. cool as anything. handsome as hell. she looks back at her mom.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{can't tonight.}
<P>__{(off her confused look)}
<D>__{i've made plans with augustus waters.}
<A>__{and with that, she walks off. frannie looks at the boy with the cigarette in his mouth. this could be trouble. or awesome. or both. and we cut to:}
