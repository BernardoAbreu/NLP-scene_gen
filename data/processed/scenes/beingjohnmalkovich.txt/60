<A>__{craig enters. lester, a giant of an old man, sits hunched behind his tiny desk.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{come in, mr. juarez. i'd stand, but, well, you know.}
<C>__{craig}
<P>__{(extending his hand)}
<D>__{actually, my name is craig schwartz, dr. lester.}
<A>__{lester flips an intercom switch.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{security.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{no, it's okay, sir. just a mixup with your secretary.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{she's not my secretary. she's what they call an executive liaison, and i'm not banging her, if that's what youre implying.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{not at all, dr. lester. i simply misspoke.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{tell me, dr. schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to lestercorp?}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{well, sir, i'm an excellent filer.}
<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(crafty)}
<D>__{you think so, eh? which comes first, l or... glooph?}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{glooph is not a letter, sir.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{damn, you are good. i tried to trick you. okay, put these in order.}
<A>__{lester hands craig a bunch of index cards. craig orders them with amazing speed and dexterity. lester watches, eyes wide.}
<C>__{lester }
<P>__{(flips intercom switch)}
<D>__{floris, get guinness on the phone.}
<C>__{floris }
<D>__{gehginnis ondah foam?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{forget it.}
<C>__{floris }
<D>__{fork ah did?}
<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(flips off switch)}
<D>__{fine woman, floris. i don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{you don't have a speech impediment, dr. lester.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. but i'm afraid i have to trust floris on this one. you see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from case western. perhaps you've read her memoirs, "i can't understand a word any of you are saying."}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{pity, it tells it like it is. that's why the eastern, read jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. that's a quote from the book jacket. george will, i think.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i apologize if you can't understan a word i'm saying, dr. schwartz.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{no. i understand perfectly.}
<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(choking up)}
<D>__{thank you for being kind enough to lie. you see, i've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. you're hired. any questions?}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{just one. why is this floor so short?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{low overhead, m'boy. we pass the savings on to you.}
<P>__{(laughs heartily)}
<D>__{but seriously, that's all covered in orientation.}
