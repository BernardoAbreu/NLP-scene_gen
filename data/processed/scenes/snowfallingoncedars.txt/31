<L>__{exterior cedar grove day}
<A>__{hatsue, drenched, alone with her thoughts in the protection of the hollow cedar. the rain is driving now, and she glances up. at something we don't see. and watches it. finally...}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{you followed me, huh?}
<A>__{pull back to see him. rain pelting off his poor soaked form. she is waiting for an answer. so...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{sorry. it sort of...happened, i just...i followed you. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{she pulls her hair behind her ears. a movement which stretches her body.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{i'm all wet.}
<A>__{she starts refastening her hair now, looking away. he comes inside, crouches as respectfully far from her as he can. which is close. he watches her, watches her, and...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{i'm sorry i kissed you on the beach.}
<A>__{no reaction. as if she hasn't heard. now his heart is beating straight through his chest.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{let's just forget about it. forget it happened.}
<A>__{she picks up her damp straw hat. and, eyes down, tracing a finger around its brim...}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{don't be sorry. i'm not sorry about it.}
<A>__{his heart bursts within him. and he struggles to keep it from his face. even though she isn't watching.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{me neither.}
<A>__{she turns her face to him, and offers a small smile. it is genuine, and therefore dazzling to the boy. she lies back on the ground. her eyes so unafraid and direct.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{do you think this is wrong?}
<A>__{he swallows. staring at her lying there so comfortably.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{the best part was that there was a 'this'. to debate the wrongness of.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{your friends would. your dad would kill me with a machete.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{we're japanese, not mexican, ishmael. he'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.}
<A>__{ah. better. they are both grinning now.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{my mom. would be the problem.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{why? we're only talking.}
<A>__{her eyes flicker. the synapse that a woman can offer a man.}
<C>__{hatsue }
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{and touches his hand. with her fingertips. the barest whisper...}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{i can't hear you.}
<A>__{thus invited, he leans down over hatsue. kisses her mouth with all the tenderness in him. this time, her eyes close gently. and her body arches slightly, into his.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{we kissed for half an hour, that first time. and i knew there would never be another day like it.}
<A>__{rain pounding now. a curtain of water, sealing them from the world.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{no matter how long i lived.}
