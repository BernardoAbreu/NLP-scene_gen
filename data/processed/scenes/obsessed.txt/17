<A>__{derek sits at a long table with his silver haired boss, joe gage and his best friend and co worker ben kingman. one wall of the room is glass, giving a view of the outer office activity. gage}
<P>__{(to derek)}
<D>__{did you talk to our german friend, herr ganz?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{matter of fact, i just got off the line to berlin.}
<C>__{gage}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{ganz doesn't like the way the stock market's been gyrating and he thinks the hedge fund wave is about to crest.}
<C>__{age}
<D>__{you think he's right?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{hell, no. i think he's a hundred percent wrong. we haven't even gotten close to that point yet. hedge fund demand is coming from individual investors which is why it's gaining mainstream acceptance. you know ganz. he gets paranoid when anything goes mainstream. he started making auf wiedersehen noises but i managed to talk him into a private equity portfolio instead... to the tune of 155 mil.}
<C>__{age}
<P>__{(pleased)}
<D>__{i knew there was a reason i promoted you. no offense, ben.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{none taken, joe. i'm just honored to be allowed to exist in derek's world.}
<A>__{derek looks over at ben who winks at him. they're friends and good natured ribbing is part of their relationship.}
<C>__{gage}
<D>__{good. i want you to throw derek all your support on this one.}
<A>__{that's when lisa walks by on the other side of the glass. gage perks up.}
<C>__{gage }
<D>__{whose legs are those?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{never seen `em before.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{i think she's one of the temps.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you mean temptress...}
<C>__{gage}
<D>__{remind me to call that agency and have them send over a couple more just like her. doesn't hurt to have a little eye candy around the office, does it, boys?}
<A>__{ben agrees. derek merely nods. he's not comfortable with this tone of sexism.}
