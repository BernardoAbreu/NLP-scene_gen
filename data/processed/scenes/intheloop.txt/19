<L>__{interior foreign office grand meeting room day}
<A>__{chad's dual horse shoe is packed with people. the room's pretty much full. karen clark from the state department is surrounded by ten or so aides and functionaries, security people and assistants. (including chad and liza one of karen's senior aides.) then there is bob adriano's gang of advisors, smaller but sitting separately. next to them is a pentagon delegation, including uniformed members of all three services. lots of hubbub. suzy leads simon, toby and judy in, and shows them to their seats. they're as far away from the us delegation as it's possible to be, and simon's seat is actually behind a pillar. suzy goes off to join michael and the foreign office delegation near the front. suzy looks over to toby, uses her hands to make mock binoculars, as if to say, 'you're very far away, look how close and therefore important i am'.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{no one will hear me if i say anything. how's your view? can we swap?}
<A>__{simon and toby swap seats, but simon can still barely see anything.}
<C>__{simon }
<P>__{(to judy)}
<D>__{can i swap with you?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i think the meeting's starting.}
<A>__{it is.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{well, quickly then, swap.}
<A>__{simon and judy swap seats. the meeting is now underway. we're with karen clark.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{we all agree this is a very tough time, but i don't want a consensus to form around the premise that conflict is necessarily the primary option at this pointerior}
<A>__{back with simon, judy and toby. simon still straining to see.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{are people thinking that? that's a bit hardcore.}
<A>__{he cranes again to see.}
<C>__{simon }
<D>__{no, this is worse. swap back.}
<A>__{simon and judy swap seats again. back with karen. she's holding up a paper in a red folder.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{this paper, authored by one of my aides, liza weld. you don't mind me fore grounding this do you liza?}
<A>__{liza reacts. her paper? in a big meeting. is this good or bad?}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{illuminates the logistical factors we face. she highlights a number of reasons why, in practical terms, we can't envision a theatre deployment for twelve months.}
<C>__{bob adriano}
<D>__{although not everyone might agree with the assumptions made in that paper.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{really such as what?}
<C>__{bob adriano}
<D>__{the committee feels a much quicker deployment is possible.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{which committee?}
<C>__{bob adriano}
<P>__{(covering)}
<D>__{this has been discussed in a number of committees. if i said one committee...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you did.}
<C>__{adriano}
<D>__{then that was a slip of the tongue}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{have you accidentally alluded to some secret committee? a war committee?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{if i can interject here, i'm aware we're pushed for time. i'd like to move us on agenda wise. our next item is international relief co ordination.}
<A>__{karen is conferring with liza, adriano with his guy.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{have you heard of this committee?}
<C>__{adriano}
<D>__{what's this liza weld paper?}
<A>__{simon is watching, feeling the meeting is passing him by.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(to judy and toby)}
<D>__{should i say something? she invited me, i should say something. if you don't say something in the first 10 minutes, you can end up not saying anything at all.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i don't know whether you should say anything.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i'm saying something ... i think i'm going to try saying something.}
<A>__{simon goes to put his hand up, toby maybe puts a calming hand on his hand. they look at one another. has toby crossed a line?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{look i just think it's worth noting that ministers in the uk government,}
<P>__{(liza whispers simon's over there)}
<D>__{such as our colleague here ...}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(pleased)}
<D>__{is she talking about me?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{simon foster ...}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{she's talking about me!}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{has made it clear that for them currently war is unforeseeable. isn't that right simon?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{well, yes, i mean, that's what i said. and i stick to what i said.}
<A>__{simon sits down. them stands back up.}
<C>__{simon }
<D>__{but that doesn't mean that what i said won't ever change. it's not imutable. or mutable. it's an ongoing ...}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(cutting in)}
<D>__{i wonder if there aren't some area of mutual agreement we can't rattle through here and see how much time we have at the end for this discussion?}
<A>__{he's ended the debate. suzy comes round the back of the meeting all smiles and hands judy a note with a smile.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{she opens the note it reads, `simon is acting like a massive tit. stop him.'}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{is that all fine?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{that's all fine. thanks for that.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{toby whispers something in simon's ear. simon doesn't look pleased. karen is still talking to the meeting. simon shuts up. he'll have this out later.}
