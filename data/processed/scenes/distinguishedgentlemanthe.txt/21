<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{you hung up on paul? he's one of my best customers.}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{i can't believe any relative of mine does that for a living.}

<A>__{the editorial catches grandma's attention.}
<C>__{general manager}
<D>__{jeff johnson's name may still be magic. but it'll take more than the magic of name recognition to solve our region's problems. i'm ned grable.}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{name recognition. lordy, what a notion. people have to be some boobs just to vote for someone because their name is johnson.}
<A>__{tommy's eyes widen.}
<C>__{grandma}
