<A>__{bill has made his way into the backyard. he looks over at the grant home. some diseased townsfolk in the backyard could conceivably see or hear him. he tries the back door, but it's locked. bill notices a window slightly open. he starts to push it up. it squeaks loudly. he peers over at the diseased. they don't hear. he throws the window up further, and crawls inside the home.}
