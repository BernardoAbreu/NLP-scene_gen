<L>__{interior motel (room six) night}
<A>__{butch enters and turns on the light. lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to us is butch's french girlfriend, fabienne.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{keep the light off.}
<A>__{butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{is that better, sugar pop?}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{oui. hard day at the office?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{pretty hard. i got into a fight.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{poor baby. can we make spoons?}
<A>__{butch climbs into bed, spooning fabienne from behind. when butch and fabienne speak to each other, they speak in babytalk.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{i was looking at myself in the mirror.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{uh huh?}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{i wish i had a pot.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{you were lookin' in the mirror and you wish you had some pot?}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{a pot. a pot belly. pot bellies are sexy.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{well you should be happy, 'cause you do.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{shut up, fatso! i don't have a pot! i have a bit of a tummy, like madonna when she did "lucky star," it's not the same thing.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{i didn't realize there was a difference between a tummy and a pot belly.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{the difference is huge.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{you want me to have a pot?}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{no. pot bellies make a man look either oafish, or like a gorilla. but on a woman, a pot belly is very sexy. the rest of you is normal. normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass, but with a big, perfectly round pot belly. if i had one, i'd wear a tee shirt two sizes too small to accentuate it.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{you think guys would find that attractive?}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{i don't give a damn what men find attractive. it's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye is seldom the same.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{if you a pot belly, i'd punch you in it.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{you'd punch me in my belly?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{right in the belly.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{i'd smother you. i'd drop it on your right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{you'd do that to me?}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{did you get everything, sugar pop?}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{yes, i did.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{good job.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{did everything go as planned?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{you didn't listen to the radio?}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{i never listen to your fights. were you the winner?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{i won alright.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{are you still retiring?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{sure am.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{what about the man you fought?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{floyd retired too.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{really?! he won't be fighting no more?!}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{not no more.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{so it all worked out in the finish?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{we ain't at the finish, baby.}
<A>__{fabienne rolls over and butch gets on top of her. they kiss.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{we're in a lot of danger, aren't we?}
<A>__{butch nods his head: "yes."}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{if they find us, they'll kill us, won't they?}
<A>__{butch nods his head: "yes."}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{but they won't find us, will they?}
<A>__{butch nods his head: "no."}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{do you still want me to go with you?}
<A>__{butch nods his head: "yes."}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{i don't want to be a burden or a nuisance }
<A>__{butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her crotch. fabienne reacts.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{say it!}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{fabienne, i want you to be with me.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{forever?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{...and ever.}
<A>__{fabienne lies her head back. butch continues to massage her crotch.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{do you love me?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{oui.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{butch? will you give me oral pleasure?}
<A>__{butch kisses her on the mouth.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{will you kiss it?}
<A>__{she nods her head: "yes."}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{but you first.}
<A>__{butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral pleasure. fabienne's face is alone in the frame.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<P>__{(in french, with english subtitles)}
<D>__{butch my love, the adventure begins.}
