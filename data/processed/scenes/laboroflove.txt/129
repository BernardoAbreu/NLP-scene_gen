<A>__{maurice practically hobbles his way down a road lined by towering pines. he stops to take a drink from his canister and keeps walking. the sounds of a car grow in the distance. maurice doesn't turn his back. the canary yellow truck pulls over the ridge with a load full of passengers. it gains distance on maurice. maurice hears the engine and waves his arm in the air signaling for it to pass him. maurice walks ten more feet before turning around. maurice's face instantly changes when he sees the demented grins through the windshield of the truck. maurice turns and quickens his pace... the truck picks up pace... maurice breaks into a run... the truck speeds up, passes maurice and stops in front of him. panic fills maurice as he watches the truck unload it's drunken passengers. eyes scan the forest on either side for a way out. maurice decides to stand his ground.}

<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{i will kill you!}
<A>__{maurice swings. denny easily avoids it. maurice doesn't see the first blow coming, it hits him in the chest maurice gasps for air as he buckles to the dirt. hands grab restrain. a powerful kick in the ribs another... laughter... another set of vicious kicks... the road and forest begin to spin... a painful slash across his face... maurice prepares for the next blow... it never comes. red and blue lights swirl... maurice looks up, barely focusing a man leans over a car door... the image becomes clearer a policeman stands poised gun aimed directly at the men hovering over him.}

<P>__{(distorted and slowed)}
<D>__{step away from him now!}
