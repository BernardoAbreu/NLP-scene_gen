<L>__{interior mission control night}
<A>__{schlissel nods. that'd work. as russert, lowenthal and the big guys start to talk this over, borokovski motions to schlissel and his new friend the tech.}
<C>__{borokovski}
<D>__{i know where there is a rocket in uzbeckistan. for cheap. a friend of mine has kept it.}
<L>__{interior ares flight deck day}
<A>__{out the window, mars drifts by in the view port. bowman looks at it kinda sadly.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{so much for saving humankind and living on mars. i guess the worms took care of that.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{the worms are not our enemy. they're our friends.}
<A>__{he's pulled the container out of his pocket. unscrews it to show her the little slimy monsters. she recoils in horror.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{you brought them back? are you insane??}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{it's okay, i'm pretty sure they don't like titanium.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{we're gonna live. on mars. hell, maybe even back on earth. maybe anywhere we want. and the reason we're gonna live, is the damn worms. yeah, they ate all the algae, and damn near everything else, but they store and excrete oxygen.}
<A>__{she finds this hard to believe. but he explains.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{that's why we could breathe. you should have seen these suckers burn when they went up. i had some time to think about this. i was in orbit for six minutes before you found me. i shoulda been dead. but the air locked in the suit was almost pure o2. 'cause of the worms. we didn't just find a new place to live on, we may have saved our old one. toxic waste, they'll eat it. poisonous landfills, they'll eat it.}
<A>__{she's still trying to absorb all this. it's been a long couple of days.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{god's got a sense of humor. he's giving us another chance. if we can all get along this time. burchenal knew somewhere that it wasn't the science, it was about having something to believe in. bud always knew. wonders of the deep. we just had to go to mars to remind ourselves of what we should have been able to see back on earth. it's not all about us. we can't kill everything and survive.}
<A>__{bowman looks back at mars. astounded. believes.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{you wanna tell them back on earth the species is saved and we're gonna live?}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{how should i know, i'm the janitor.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{look, commander...i just fought off half a million screaming nematodes, and a killer robot and glued myself onto a rocket to get offa mars, and i was wondering...}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{if you could kiss me?}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{he does. she kisses him back. they continue for a long damn time. finally, they break apart and...}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{it's an extra fifty days back.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{gee, wonder what we'll find to do with ourselves.}
<A>__{as she starts to laugh...}
