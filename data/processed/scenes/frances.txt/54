<A>__{dick is talking on the phone in the living room.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{yes, of course she'll make a statement on women's rights. call back tomorrow, okay?}

<C>__{dick}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{dwayne steele's residence.}
<A>__{through the half open door to the bedroom we see frances dozing, an open script laid out beside her.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{what...?}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{yes. yes, i will tell her.}
<A>__{he hangs up. stares off. slowly enters the bedroom. frances looks up.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{you learn your lines?}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(nods drowsily)}
<D>__{sort of.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{there've been some calls.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{claire?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{yeah, claire. she said she was fired. too bad, huh?}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(apprehensively)}
<D>__{fired?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{yeah. she said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.}
<A>__{frances looks stricken. dick presses on.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{there was another call too. from your agent. he says your summer stock deal is all set. so you're going back east, huh?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{...yes.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{without me.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{showdown.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{you weren't going to tell me, were you? just pack up and leave, is that it?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{dick, we need some time apart }
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{hey, i'm not a complete fool, you know. i can see you're going sour on me, and when i try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{dick, i can't even breathe here...}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{dwayne! i'm dwayne now! and you damn well better get used to it!}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(softly, remembering)}
<D>__{dick...}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{i don't suppose it occurred to you that i might want to leave too, that i might want to do theatre? no, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? and the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{no. it's all about that night, isn't it?}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(bewildered)}
<D>__{what night?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{the premiere. i never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{you want his name?}
<A>__{dick is crumbling inside.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{what...?}
<A>__{we watch it sink in. confusion... self pity... building gradually to resentment and rage. he starts to throw a tantrum. hurling things around the room. frances just sits there.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{my god... i think you're overplaying this a bit...?}
<A>__{he hurls a pillow against the wall and rushes out. frances looks after him, then turns. she's now facing the bureau.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{goodbye, dick.}
<A>__{a mirror sits on top of the bureau. she looks into it. doesn't like her expression. turns the mirror away.}
