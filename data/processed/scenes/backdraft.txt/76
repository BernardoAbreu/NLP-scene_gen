<L>__{exterior street chicken accident day}
<A>__{a truck has jackknifed across the avenue and spilled its contents several thousand baby chicks. they're scurrying everywhere as brian's company tries to round them up. it's hopeless as the exhausted firemen stuff handfuls of the cheeping cargo into their turn out coats. there's ghetto kids all around, grabbing at the chicks, grabbing at the fire engine.}

<C>__{axe}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{maybe you should have gotten more sleep last night.}
<A>__{brian looks at him. does he mean what he thinks he means? tim is coming out of a small store across the street. he hands a small bag of groceries to adcox.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{this everything you wanted?}
<A>__{everyone grows suddenly silent.}
