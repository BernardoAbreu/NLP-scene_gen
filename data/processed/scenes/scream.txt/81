<A>__{the camera sits on the book shelf lodged between two knickknacks, completely inconspicuous. the camera widens to reveal several teens watching the tv the horror diehards.}
<D>__{teen #1 look, here it comes. splat! teen #2 the blood's not the right color. why do they do that? it's too red.}

<D>__{i wanna see jamie lee's breasts. when do we see jamie lee's breasts?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{not until trading places in '83. jamie lee was always the virgin in horror movies. she didn't show her tits until she went legit.}
<C>__{boy teen}
<D>__{no way.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{that's why she always lived. only virgins can outsmart the killer in the big chase scene in the end. don't you know the rules?}

<D>__{what rules?}
<A>__{randy hits the pause button on the remote and stands in front of the television, explaining.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{there are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. for instance: 1. you can never have sex. the minute you get a little nookie you're as good as gone. sex always equals death. 2. never drink or do drugs. the sin factor. it's an extension of number one. and 3. never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "i will be right back."}
