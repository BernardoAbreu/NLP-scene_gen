<L>__{interior cargo bay borg hive}
<A>__{the onrush of gas is gone. but it has affected every surface of the room like an acid wash. every piece of borg machinery is smoking and hissing. the two borg drones are lying on the floor, dead all organic matter and flesh have been dissolved from their bodies, leaving only raw mechanical skeletons.}
<T>__{move to reveal:}
<B>__{data and the borg queen}
<A>__{lying on the floor, still locked together. data is a shocking image: all of his human flesh has been stripped away, leaving only his pure android self. his metallic skull gleams in the dim light... even his eyes are gone. his mechanical left arm is still intact, but the right human arm is completely gone. his torso is stripped of the human flesh, leaving pure android with no soft human touches. data as we've never seen him before raw and mechanistic. data rolls over... still locked around him is the mechanical skeleton of the borg queen. a metallic spinal column with two arms with clawed hands leading off it... and a blinking, electronic brain stem at the very top of the spine. data throws off the grotesque form. the borg queen carcass writhes and claws at the air. she speaks in a flat, mechanical voice.}

<D>__{data...}
<A>__{data reaches out with one hand... grabs the metal spinal column just below the brain stem... and snaps it in two. the blinking brain stem fritzes out.}
