<L>__{interior red lobster night}
<A>__{olive and anson sit in a booth at a dimly lit red lobster. olive looks beautiful. the `a' on her shirt is sequined.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i can't believe you brought me to the nicest restaurant in town. this is swank. i was beginning to think that there was no such thing as class.}
<C>__{anson}
<D>__{yeah. what's better than getting to select your dinner and have nice conversation while they boil it alive in the back?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i think anson jr. doesn't mind making the sacrifice. you don't mind that i named him anson jr., do you?}
<C>__{anson}
<D>__{not at all. i'm actually kind of honored.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{do you believe this whole thing about lobster being an aphrodisiac?}
<C>__{anson}
<P>__{(lying out his ass)}
<D>__{i didn't know it was.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{y'know, medical science has not substantiated claims that any particular food increases sexual desire or performance. it's so funny when guys ply women with food that they think is gonna get them laid. i mean, what's really sexy about slurping back oysters? you know, native people believed that you gained the strength of the animal by consuming it. some people grind up rhinoceros horn, because it's thought to stiffen the male sex organ. it's all bullshit. and spanish fly? it's pulverized beetle that people eat! although, it's illegal for human consumption in the united states and do you know why? because if you take just a bit too much, it causes painful urination, fever and bloody discharge.}
<A>__{a server appears with their lobster. anson is an odd shade of green from olive's little science lesson.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{yum!}
<A>__{the server leaves them and olive digs in. anson is feeling nauseous and can't touch his. from across the restaurant, a parade of servers enters from the back, enthusiastically clapping and holding a cupcake. leading the brigade is meerkat todd, who's wearing a red foam}
<B>__{lobster hat.}
<A>__{with as much spirit, as he has as a meerkat }
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{i don't know but i've been told!}
<C>__{parade of servers}
<D>__{i don't know but i've been told!}
<A>__{he leads them through to another part of the restaurant.}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(to anson)}
<D>__{i didn't know meerkat todd worked here! and he's a lobster! i wonder if i should start calling him lobster todd.}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{marguerite is getting old!}
<C>__{parade of servers}
<D>__{marguerite is getting old!}
<A>__{they land at the table of the birthday girl. olive cranes her neck to see rhiannon, miserable of course, sitting with her parents at a table in the next room. olive immediately becomes uneasy.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{shit!}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{the best thing is her dessert is free!}
<C>__{parade of servers}
<D>__{the best thing is her dessert is free!}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{the worst thing is i sing off key!}
<C>__{parade of servers}
<D>__{the worst thing is i sing off key!}
<A>__{olive is visibly squirming in her seat.}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{sound off!}
<C>__{parade of servers}
<D>__{happy!}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{sound off!}
<C>__{parade of servers}
<D>__{birthday!}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{sound off!}
<C>__{parade of servers}
<D>__{happy birthday to you!}
<A>__{the whole place applauds, unenthusiastically. anson sees olive's discomfort.}
<C>__{anson}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{rhiannon's over there.}
<C>__{anson}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{so? she's been in love with you since the first grade.}
<C>__{anson}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{well, she's my best friend.}
<C>__{anson}
<D>__{i thought you two weren't speaking.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{we're not, but it doesn't mean i should be out with you.}
<C>__{anson}
<D>__{then why are you?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i don't know. you asked me out?}
<C>__{anson}
<D>__{exactly. i have no interest in her. i mean, we're friends, but }
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{she can't see us.}
<C>__{anson}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{do you want me to get the check?}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(touched)}
<D>__{would you mind?}
<A>__{he gestures for the server who appears.}
<C>__{anson}
<D>__{could we get our check?}
<C>__{server}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{is everything okay?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i just remembered i'm allergic to shellfish. i always forget that my respiratory system would collapse and i'd die. it sucks i know.}
<A>__{even more confused, the server obliges and gives them their check.}
<C>__{olive }
<P>__{(digging in her purse)}
<D>__{let me get it. i have a gift certificate.}
<A>__{she pulls it out and hands it to the waitress, who leaves.}
<C>__{anson}
<D>__{but i asked you out.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{and i ruined it, so let me bear the financial brunt.}
<P>__{(beat.)}
<D>__{i'm so sorry about this. but she really likes you.}
<C>__{anson}
<D>__{she and i just don't have much in common.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{and you and i do?}
<C>__{anson}
<D>__{i think so. for instance, i, too think nina howell's a twat.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{yeah, well, if that's our magical connection, i should date the entire school.}
<C>__{anson}
<D>__{haven't you?}
<A>__{olive suddenly becomes self conscious and a little bit pissed.}
<C>__{anson }
<D>__{kidding!}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{yeah, about that }
<A>__{the server reappears with the check.}
<C>__{server}
<D>__{you have a remaining balance of fourteen dollars and thirty six cents.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{keep it. tip.}
<A>__{the sever smiles and leaves them again.}
<C>__{anson}
<D>__{let's get out of here.}
<A>__{they duck out of the booth trying to keep their heads down, but olive can't resist the urge to look up and see if rhiannon sees them. she does. olive and rhiannon make eye contact. whereas, olive looks remorseful, rhiannon looks like she's just been stabbed in the back which she has. the abernathys see her, as well, and wave. it's painfully obvious to olive that rhi hasn't told her parents about their differences. she starts to go over, but rhiannon's face is turning vermillion in anger. olive just waves, sheepishly and leaves with anson. i e. anson's car red lobster parking lot moments later olive's face is painted with guilt. she feels like shit, but doesn't want to externalize it. anson puts his hand on her knee.}
<C>__{anson}
<D>__{i have something for you.}
<A>__{olive manages a smile. he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a $500 gift certificate to anthropologie and hands it to her. olive is disappointed, but tries not to show it.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{oh. i didn't realize }
<A>__{snapping out of her guilt.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{okay. so, what did we "do" on this date?}
<C>__{anson}
<D>__{whatever $500 gets me.}
<A>__{he leans over and kisses her. she pushes him off.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{wait. this isn't how it works. i don't actually }
<A>__{but he's kissing her again, a little too forcibly. she pushes him off again.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{you don't get it. i'm not technically having sex with people for money. you know that, right? besides, even if i was, we're in the parking lot of a red lobster.}
<C>__{anson}
<D>__{we can go wherever you want, but i think it would be kind of hot here.}
<A>__{he takes off his shirt.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{dude, i gotta go. it's been sad.}
<A>__{she gets out of the car. he rolls down the window.}
<C>__{anson}
<D>__{olive, you're being stupid. i will take you home.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<A>__{he drives off, leaving her outside in the parking lot.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{fuck.}
<A>__{as luck would have it, meerkat todd, is coming out the back exit. he sees her and gives her a surprised, toothy grin.}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{hey olive!}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{hey todd.}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{oh, i'm just hanging out in the parking lot. i do that sometimes. not necessarily just here. the one outside of applebee's is fun, too.}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<P>__{(laughing at her oddness)}
<D>__{you want a ride somewhere?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{nah. i'm fine.}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{your friend rhi is inside. it's her mom's birthday.}
<A>__{tears begin to glisten in olive's eyes.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{she's not my friend anymore.}
<A>__{todd walks over and puts his arm around her and leads her to his car. he opens the door for her and she sits down. i e. meerkat todd's car night olive is trying to pull herself together but she can't stop crying as todd drives her home. todd doesn't know what to say to her. finally }
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{you wanna talk about it?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{what's to say? i'm a horrible person. everyone thinks i'm a whore and, for the first time, i'm starting to believe it.}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{oh, don't act like you don't know what people are saying about me.}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{i know what people are saying. doesn't mean i believe them.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{olive, contrary to popular belief, i'm not an idiot. i know exactly what's going on and i know exactly what you're doing.}
<A>__{she stops crying.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{who told you?}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{no one had to tell me. all i know is once upon a time, there was a scared little kid in a closet at a party who wasn't ready for his first kiss and there was this amazing little girl who lied for him.}
<A>__{she smiles through her tears.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{you remember that?}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{yeah and after i ran out, you pulled brandon in. yeah, i know about that, by the way.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{and look how he turned out.}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{sometimes i still pretend you were my first kiss.}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{yeah? who was?}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{your friend. rhiannon.}
<A>__{olive's laughter turns to rage.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{what!?}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{yeah. about a year later. it sucked.}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(blurting it out)}
<D>__{she knew how i felt about you!}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{how do you feel about me?}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(ignoring him)}
<D>__{she did it first! and here i am feeling soooo bad and that bitch!}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{wait. how do you feel about me?}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(aggressively defensive)}
<D>__{felt! i said felt!}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{he stops the car. they're at her house.}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{i mean, it's not that i don't still feel that way.}
<A>__{there's an awkward moment between them.}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{olive. if i promise not to tell anyone, could i kiss you?}
<A>__{despite the fact that this is positively the most romantic moment of her young life, olive looks down.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{no. not tonight. i don't want you to kiss me when mascara's running down my cheek or some shithead has forced his tongue down my throat only a half hour ago. i've wanted to kiss you since the eighth grade, but i want it to be perfect. and right now, my life's a mess. i need to get it under control before i drag you into it.}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{what if i told you i wanted to be dragged into it? maybe i could help.}
<A>__{he holds out his hand and she takes it.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{now i have a reason to fix this catastrophe i've brought upon myself. and i'm going to.}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{he smiles his goofy grin and she embraces him. she hops out of the car and goes to her front door.}
