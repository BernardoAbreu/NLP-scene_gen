<L>__{exterior museum of natural history day}
<A>__{as margo arrives, the camera moves up and over the building, comes to rest on the imposing turrets, intersecting roof lines, and gothic arches of the museum of natural history. this is not an ordinary building; it's a 19th century monument to science and mankind. the structure fills an entire city block. happy visitors pour into the museum as margo takes the imposing wide stone steps two at a time. we hear screams of pleasure and release, the normal raucous noises of a large group of third grade children. margo is amused to find herself surrounded by kids. their teacher, mrs. beasley, a stern woman in glasses with a thick new york accent, calls after them as they all head inside.}

<D>__{don't run, children! stay with your partner and do not run! if anyone runs they will be sent back to the bus!}
<A>__{ignoring mrs. beasley, two boys charge past margo. henry and larry. henry has a buzz cut; larry has rasta dread knots. both are 8 years old, wear high top sneakers and shorts so big they graze their ankles.}
<C>__{mrs. beasley}
<D>__{henry! larry! what did i just say! you walk right this minute! did you hear me?!}
<A>__{reluctantly, henry and larry slow to a rapid race walk as they reach the huge doorway flanked by two northwest coast indian totem poles. above the doorway workmen are hanging a large banner. it reads: "superstition exhibit... opening oct. 29"}
