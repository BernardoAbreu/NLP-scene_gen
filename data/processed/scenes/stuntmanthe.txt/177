<A>__{as she falls apart before our eyes, and an o.s. voice on a playback tape insinuates into our consciousness, echoing as though heard through many loudspeakers.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i envy you the pride you must feel today. a young hero has fallen gloriously on the field of battle.}
<A>__{hands reach in and drape a sash around nina's throat. from it dangles a swastika. for nina, there is still no voice, no camera, only the obliterating shame for that image of her naked body burned into her father's memory. and yet, that shame is so similar to the shame she should be feeling as the woman in eli's film at this mockery of her son's death.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{a nation has lost a son! a mother has lost a son!}
<A>__{the sound has now grown to a proportion reminiscent of those german newsreels of hitler victory rallies.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{this sacrifice in blood brings closer man's noblest dream...a thousand years of peace!}
<A>__{the thunderous sound of ten thousand voices shouting: "sieg heil! sieg heil!" has shattered nina's isolation. she is now aware that her personal despair has been used to accomplish an acting trick, and it only adds to her degradation and sense of shame, ironically making her performance even more poignant. the crowd on the playback roars with fanatic zeal.}
