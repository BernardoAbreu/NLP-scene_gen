<L>__{interior hunsecker's penthouse susan's bedroom day}
<A>__{susan is on the phone. listening to what steve says, she is frightened almost too frightened; it is as if, in some curious sense, she had been expecting this blow. it brings an echo of an earlier tragedy.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{a smear?...what...what kind of smear...? where are you?}
<L>__{interior sidney's apartment}
<A>__{steve is on the phone in foreground, the others watching him. in particular, sally, who stands near steve, is studying him with obvious sympathy. she looks slowly towards sidney.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(to the phone)}
<D>__{we're on our way to the elysian room to dicker with van cleve he's fired us already. i will call you later, dear... 'bye!...}
<A>__{he hangs up quietly, looks at sidney and walks towards the door.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{come on, frank.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{as the door closes behind steve, frank follows, more slowly. as d'angelo reaches the door, he pauses with his hand on the doorknob and turns back to study sidney.}
<B>__{sidney}
<A>__{he feels uneasy under d'angelo's scrutiny. sally, in background, is also watching sidney.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(to d'angelo)}
<D>__{what are you looking at...?}
<A>__{d'angelo he does not answer for a moment. the unspoken accusation in his look is very clear. then:}
<C>__{d'angelo}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{the ugly world, sidney...}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{if i told steve what i really think, he'd tear your head off...}

<A>__{he hesitates before turning towards sally (because he realizes that this exchange with d'angelo must have confirmed sally in her suspicions).}
<B>__{sally}
<A>__{her face shows that sidney is right. sally is deeply hurt, disillusioned.}

<A>__{sidney turns to her, challenging.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(not looking at him)}
<D>__{nothing...}
<A>__{resentfully, sidney moves about the room. sensing the silent accusation against him, he is aggressive.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you know, sally, sometimes i get the impression you think you live in star bright park. this is life, kid get used to it!}
<A>__{sidney comes to the phone on her desk. he dials. then he glances swiftly at sally and, carrying the phone, walks into the bedroom, dragging the long cord behind him.}
