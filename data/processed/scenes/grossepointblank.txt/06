<D>__{effective. but to tell you the truth, i've lost my passion for work.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{do you like the people you work with?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i work alone.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{that's it then. that's it. i've always been alone. that's why i'm a good driver. i can handle it. see, i can think on my feet. i survive, i'm a thinker. and i can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. some people can't do it! some people are ranting and raving, "tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, i can't i want a go!" where you gonna go? you're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. you ain't going nowhere. you leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. what's the big deal, right?}
