<L>__{exterior a deck promenade day}
<A>__{rose and jack stroll aft, past people lounging on deck chairs in the slanting late afternoon light. stewards scurry to serve tea or hot cocoa.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(girlish and excited)}
<A>__{you know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<A>__{you wouldn't last two days. there's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(angry in a flash)}
<A>__{listen, buster... i hate caviar! and i'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{i'm sorry. really... i am.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{well, alright. there's something in me, jack. i feel it. i don't know what it is, whether i should be an artist, or, i don't know... a dancer. like isadora duncan.... a wild pagan spirit... she leaps forward, lands deftly and whirls like a dervish. then she sees something ahead and her face lights up.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{...or a moving picture actress! she takes his hand and runs, pulling him along the deck toward daniel and mary marvin. daniel is cranking the big wooden movie camera as she poses stiffly at the rail.}
<C>__{marvin}
<A>__{you're sad. sad, sad, sad. you've left your lover on the shore. you may never see him agian. try to be sadder, darling. suddenly rose shoots into the shot and strikes a theatrical pose at the rail next to mary. mary bursts out laughing. rose pulls jack into the picture and makes him pose. marvin grins and starts yelling and gesturing. we see this in cuts, with music and no dialogue.}
