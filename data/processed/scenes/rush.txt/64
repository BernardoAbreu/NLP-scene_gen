<A>__{the car drives. the radio plays. marlene sings along. niki can't help noticing something. he turns down the music. marlene's smile fades..}
<C>__{marlene}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{you hear that noise when you accelerate?}
<C>__{marlene}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{your drive belt is loose.}
<C>__{marlene}
<D>__{my what?}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{alternator. and when you brake, your foot goes all the way down. means there's air in the system.}
<C>__{marlene}
<D>__{anything else?}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{no. apart from the rear brakes are imbalanced. the front right wheel is flat, and it feels like a crack in the engine block...which explains why you're drifting so much.}
<C>__{marlene}
<D>__{how can you tell?}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{my ass.}
<C>__{marlene}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{god gave me an ok mind, but a really good ass, which can feel everything in a car.}
<C>__{marlene}
<D>__{you don't know what you're talking about. the car is fine. and it just had a service a week ago.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{not a good one.}
<C>__{marlene}
<D>__{a very good one. from a proper garage. it cost a fortune. this car is good as new. relax.}
