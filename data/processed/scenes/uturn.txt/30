<A>__{bobby on the phone.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i know, mr. arkadin. i know. i was on my way to you, it's just ... what a day i've had. i know i'm coming up with a highly improbable story, and i know you're not going to believe this, but this ...is... what happened. i had the money, i swear i had it. i was on my way to vegas when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.}
<A>__{mr. arkady cleans his nails completely disinterested in what bobby is saying.}
<C>__{mr. arkady}
<D>__{that's a shame, bobby. a real shame.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{and that's not the half of it, mr. arkadin...}
<C>__{mr. arkady}
<D>__{"arkady"}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{right, mr. arkady. and that's not the half of it. i got your money, and i go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets robbed !}
<C>__{mr. arkady}
<D>__{...and let me guess. this robber he gets your money.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no. two of them. two robbers. and they both get nailed... get shot by the old lady.}
<C>__{mr. arkady}
<D>__{the old lady?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{with a shotgun ! she kills both of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. not one bill is left alive. i mean, what are the odds?}
<P>__{mr. arkady (beat, dry)}
<D>__{pretty long, bobby.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{mr. arkady, honest, i ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. so now i don't have a cent to my name. i can't even get my car out of the garage. i tell you, mister... (pause) if it weren't for bad luck i wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know? (beat, waits) so, i was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty dollars so i could get my car out of this garage, see? the bus depot here has a western union thing. and of course i will pay it back with the rest of the money.}
<C>__{mr. arkady}
<D>__{which you don't have.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{but which i can get. no problem. look, i can sell my car in vegas. blue book it's worth 16 at least. i just need the 150, uh...}
<A>__{sergei looks like he's ready to pound heads.}
<C>__{mr. arkady }
<D>__{where are you?}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{uh...a little shithole in arizona called superior. about 200 miles east of phoenix.}
<P>__{mr. arkady (pausing, v.o.)}
<D>__{superior, hunh?}
<A>__{bobby suddenly feeling suspicious.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yeah, if you could send it care of...}
<C>__{mr. arkady}
<D>__{...now, let me get this straight. two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. now you owe me thirteen thousand dollars, you call me collect then ask me to wire you one hundred fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{a hundred forty five would probably cover it.}
<C>__{mr. arkady}
<D>__{a hundred and ... now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk: i don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller. you owe me thirteen thousand dollars and i want it . i don't care how you get it, or where from, but i want it on my desk tomorrow, or i will show you what real bad luck is.}
<A>__{sergei snaps a pencil he's holding in his hand, which goes flying by arkady's head, forcing him to duck.}
<C>__{mr. arkady}
<D>__{do you understand me you little fuck?}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{oh, fuck you too!}
<C>__{mr. arkady}
<D>__{what'd you say to me!}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{shit i'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain i'm under. i'm just under a lot of strain here.}
<A>__{there is a sharp silence at the other end. bobby waits.}
<C>__{mr. arkady}
<D>__{bobby, you owed me that 'bread' 4 weeks ago. now you tell me you want another week. that's 5 weeks, bobby. that's also 5 fingers, cause you and i know it's a finger a week bobby. so you got balls. good now you come here tomorrow and you talk to me real nice and maybe i don't take the other 3 fingers you owe me, you see? tomorrow and bobby, don't make me come look for you, okay...have nice day.}
<A>__{he hands the phone back to sergei.}
<C>__{sergei }
<D>__{you got that? have nice day (hangs up).}
<C>__{mr. arkady}
<D>__{the nerva that piece of shit! and look at you, you neanderthal don't you fuckin' break pencils, you goombah!}
<C>__{sofia}
<D>__{finger? what are you, a faggot? in my country a man don't pay we cut off his head.}
<A>__{arkady motions sergei to come close.}
<C>__{mr. arkady}
<D>__{get your ass down to this superior, arizona. bring me this bobby cooper. i don't think he got the lesson. this is your last chance, sergei.}
