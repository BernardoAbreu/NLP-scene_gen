<L>__{int virgil's parlor day}
<A>__{in tight on a gleaming silver shield, "town marshal, tombstone, a.t." pull back to reveal it pinned to virgil's breast. he sits by his parlor hearth with morgan at his side. wyatt sits opposite with his head in his hands.}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{i couldn't help it, wyatt. i looked at that woman and it was just like somebody slapping me in the face. i mean these people're afraid to even walk down the street and i'm trying to make money off it like some kind of god damn vulture. that's not me, that's somebody i don't even know.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{virgil, please. don't do this to me.}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{it's got nothin' to do with you, wyatt. it's }
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{nothing to do with me? i'm your brother for christ's sake. god, i don't believe this.}
<P>__{(turns to morgan)}
<D>__{talk to him, will you? or hit him.}
<P>__{(no answer, pauses)}
<D>__{oh no, don't tell me...}
<A>__{morgan looks down in sheepish silence. then he pulls back his coat, revealing the deputy's badge on this vest. wyatt groans.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{like you said, wyatt. we're brothers. gotta back your brother's play. just did like i figured you would.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{listen to me, both of you. this is no good. this is trouble we don't need. for the first time in our lives we got a chance to stop wandering and finally be a family. do this and you throw it all away. you saw what happened to fred white.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{come on, we're not about pickin' fights. just gonna keep a little order, that's all.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{like you said, just gotta know how to handle 'em. old fred wasn't up to it. we know that we're doin', wyatt.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{all right, say you're right, say you don't get yourself killed. there's something else.}
<P>__{(turns to morgan)}
<D>__{it's too late for virge, he already rolled his bone. but it's not too late for you, morg.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{what're you talkin' about?}
<A>__{wyatt exhales wearily then crouches down in front of his baby brother, looking deep in his eyes, his voice soft, plaintive:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{all the years i worked the cowtowns, i was only ever mixed up in one shooting. just one. a man got killed. wasn't my fault, just doin' my job. i don't even know if it was my bullet that dropped him, but... i don't kno, it's sort of hard to explain. at first i just felt funny, you know, kind of clammy inside. but when it finally sunk in what i'd done... believe me, boy, you don't ever want to feel that way. not ever.}
<P>__{(pauses)}
<D>__{didn't even make a dent, did i?}
<P>__{(stands, exits)}
<D>__{you're both makin' a big mistake.}
