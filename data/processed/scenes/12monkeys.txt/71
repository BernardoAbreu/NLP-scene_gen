<A>__{on foot now, cole pulls an astonished railly to a wall covered with graffiti, a hopeless tangle of symbols, words, and crude pictures. clueless, railly stares at the wall, then at cole. cole touches a bit of red stenciled graffiti hidden under gang insignias. we can just see twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{the twelve monkeys!!! they're here.}
<P>__{(looks around)}
<D>__{somewhere. come on!}
<A>__{he pulls her along the sidewalk. no question, he's insane. at the next alley entrance, cole stops abruptly. then, still keeping a firm grip on railly's arm, he starts ripping down newly tacked up posters announcing a rap concert. railly stares at him, then turns and is looking all around when, suddenly, cole pulls her up tight and threatens...}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{look, i'm warning you. you do anything, i'm going to go crazy hurt people!}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{i'm not going to "do" anything, i promise. but you need help, james. none of this is what you think it is.}
<A>__{angle on cole, not listening, staring triumphantly! he's found another partially obscured stencil of the twelve monkeys! but just then, a raspy voice startles cole.}
<C>__{raspy voice }
<D>__{you can't hide from them, bob.}
<A>__{cole whirls, sees a derelict, louie, leering at him, speaking in a voice eerily like the raspy voice from the next cell in the future.}
<C>__{louie}
<D>__{no, sir, old bob don't even try.}
<P>__{(conspiratorially)}
<D>__{they hear everything. they got that tracking device on you. they can find you anywhere. anytime. ha ha!}
<A>__{railly looks from louis to cole, sees cole's stunned reaction.}
<C>__{louie}
<P>__{(touches his back jaw)}
<D>__{in the tooth, bob! right?}
<P>__{(sudden triumphant grin)}
<D>__{but i fooled 'em, old buddy!}
<A>__{he opens his mouth wide. no teeth' cole grabs railly and pulls her into the alley and down it.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{they're keeping an eye on me.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{who's keeping an eye on you?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{the man...with the voice. i recognized him. he's from the present. he...}
<A>__{cole breaks off, freezes as he sees... there on a brick wall is a stencil of the dancing monkeys and further on, another red stencil!}
