<A>__{a muslim family sits together at a table under a tented canopy: 32 year old man nervously chewing on a toothpick, and his 8 and 15 year old sons. the 8yo leans his weight into an old man hunched and obscured by his grandson this is his grandfather. he gently rubs the boy's head with an ancient left hand. the boy finger paints in arabic script, right to left, getting paint on the table. read the translation: there is no god but allah. the grandfather's face is down, obscured by his shumagh: the head wrap worn by some muslim men. never a clear view of his face. his 32 year old son and eldest grandson sit next to them, the son talking quietly on a cell phone, chewing that toothpick, eyes set on something in the distance: a security gate three hundred yards away, the entrance to some sort of compound. the compound looks like a walled off subdivision, most of which we can see from this high up. the landscape is foreign. scrub desert. ten miles beyond, on the horizon: the shimmer of a modern skyline. surreal monolithic shapes made more so by the heat. muted yells claps screams waft in from that compound now... catches the youngest grandson's attention. eyes lift up from his painting: the yells claps screams are coming from a softball game mostly visible behind the compound's reinforced walls that extend a mile in each direction. played on the only stretch of green grass visible from this vantage.}
