<L>__{exterior ice channels moments later}
<A>__{(scene 2200 hatchlings to the rescue) whoosh! whoosh! whoosh! juveniles blur past, like flying raptors, zigzagging wildly. riding bareback, hiccup & co. hurtle through the narrow ice channels created by massive splits in the iceberg shelves.}
<C>__{ruffnut}
<D>__{fly straight!}
<C>__{fishlegs}
<D>__{i don't want to die!}
<C>__{tuffnut}
<D>__{we can't fly these things!}
<C>__{fishlegs}
<D>__{yeah, no kidding!}
<A>__{fishlegs barrels into a snow bank, sending several chunks right into eret's face as rides inverted and hollering.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{but won't that bewilderbeast just take control of these guys, too?}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{they're babies. they don't listen to anyone!}
<C>__{tuffnut}
<D>__{yeah, just like us!}
<A>__{gobber follows up the rear clumsily, struggling for control.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{this... is... very dangerous!}
<A>__{he pulls alongside hiccup and valka.}
<C>__{gobber }
<D>__{some might suggest this is poorly conceived.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{well, it's a good thing that i never listen.}
<A>__{a sharp ridge rushes up at them. they're going to crash. hiccup rounds one side of it, and gobber flies down the other side. they shout through gaps in the iceberg.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{so what is your plan?!}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{get toothless back and kick drago's }
<A>__{he's interrupted by another closure in the gaps of ice. they blast out of the other side.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{heads up!}
<A>__{they split to avoid another peak and then reconvene, only to find another icy outcropping directly in their path.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{and that thing.}
<A>__{gobber hits it, with a thud and a yelp.}
