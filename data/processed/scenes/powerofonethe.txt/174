<C>__{pk}
<D>__{wanted to see us, sir?}
<C>__{st. john}
<D>__{yes. come in. close the door.}
<A>__{as the door closes, brigadier johannes bretyn, a quiet but formidable man, comes into their line of vision. trouble is in the air.}
<C>__{st. john}
<D>__{this is brigadier bretyn from the police department.}
<A>__{bretyn just nods his head.}
<C>__{st. john}
<D>__{he has come to deliver, in person, an order to close the saturday school.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{bretyn}
<D>__{because it is illegal.}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{we're only teaching them how to read and do sums.}
<C>__{bretyn}
<D>__{you don't have certification to do that.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{prince of wales is a certified school.}
<C>__{bretyn}
<D>__{yes. but not certified for that sort of thing.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{can he do this, sir?}
<C>__{bretyn}
<D>__{of course i can do it. would i be here if i couldn't? come now meneer headmaster. let's end this now. i have a full day ahead of me still.}
<A>__{st. john meets bretyn's steely eyes. he cannot hold the man's gaze.}
<C>__{st. john}
<P>__{(resigned)}
<D>__{the saturday school is to be disbanded until further notice.}
<C>__{bretyn}
<D>__{thank you, meneer headmaster. your cooperation in this matter is very appreciated. good day.}
<A>__{bretyn goes to exit.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{you know it can't go on like this forever.}
<A>__{st. john tenses.}
<C>__{bretyn}
<D>__{what can't?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{what you're doing.}
<C>__{bretyn}
<D>__{i'm just doing my job. and if you'll take some advice, you should just do yours.}
<A>__{bretyn exits.}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{is that really the end of it, sir?}
<C>__{st. john}
<D>__{for the moment i'm afraid it is.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{if we let them get away with it on our own grounds, it will never change. it'll just get worse.}
<C>__{st. john}
<D>__{history disputes you.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{history takes too long.}
<C>__{st. john}
<D>__{yes it does. but it is never kind to those who try to hurry it.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{i feel we should resist, sir.}
<C>__{st. john}
<D>__{so do i, p.k. but this is not a subtle government. they mean to have their way and damn the consequences. and i cannot jeopardize this school, no matter how i personally feel. i'm sorry.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i heard you were accepted at oxford.}
<C>__{morrie}

<C>__{st. john}
<D>__{to both of you.}
<C>__{pk}
<P>__{(tight)}
<D>__{thank you, sir.}
<A>__{an uncomfortable silence lingers.}
<C>__{st. john}
<D>__{we'll talk before you go.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{yes, sir. will that be all?}
<C>__{st. john}
<D>__{that'll be all.}
<A>__{pk turns immediately and exits. morrie and st. john trade an uncomfortable look.}
