<L>__{interior tosca's mansion later day}
<A>__{as servants stand by, tosca and his wife and their only guests frank and ana finished with lunch, get up from the table in the formal formal dining room. as mrs. tosca leads ana off to give her a tour of the house, the men head off the other way.}
<C>__{tosca}
<D>__{she's a lovely girl. you should marry her.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{too many things to look after right now to think about that.}
<C>__{tosca}
<D>__{frank. that's a mistake. if i may say. don't take her for granted, girl like that.}
<A>__{they enter a rich, wood paneled study lined with books.}
<C>__{tosca}
<D>__{you interested in history, frank? the events that have brought us to where we are today? you know who was? bumpy.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{bumpy was interested in a lot of things.}
<C>__{tosca}
<D>__{i always wonder if people know when history's being made. and what they're doing at the time. this, for instance, could be a historic moment, and you're sipping a glass of ice water.}
<A>__{droplets snake down frank's glass. he senses tosca has finally gotten around to why he was invited here.}
<C>__{tosca}
<D>__{bumpy and i did a lot of business together, as you know. whatever he needed, he'd come to me and i'd do my best to provide it. he came to me, i didn't go to him, is the point i'm trying to make. you know why?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{he didn't have what you needed. you had what he needed. we've always had to come to you.}
<C>__{tosca}
<D>__{yes. until now.}
<A>__{tosca studies frank, who is a study in inscrutability.}
<C>__{tosca}
<D>__{monopolies are illegal in this country, frank, because no one can compete with a monopoly. if they let the dairy farmers do that, half of them would go out of business tomorrow.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i'm just trying to make a living.}
<C>__{tosca}
<D>__{which is your right. because this is america. but not at the unreasonable expense of others. that's un american.}
<P>__{(he studies frank)}
<D>__{you know the price you pay for a gallon of milk doesn't represent its true cost of production. it's controlled. set.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i set a price i think is fair.}
<C>__{tosca}
<D>__{it's very unfair, in fact. your customers are happy, but what about your fellow dairy farmers? you're not thinking of them.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(very calmly)}
<D>__{i'm thinking of them as much as they ever thought of me.}
<C>__{tosca}
<D>__{all right. i can see you're getting excited. don't get excited. that's not why i invited you to my home. to get excited.}
<A>__{frank doesn't look excited at all. he's the picture of calm. tosca smiles benignly and gets up.}
<C>__{tosca}
<D>__{here, i got something for you.}
