<B>__{credit sequence.}
<A>__{as opening credits play, we study the city's nighttime pulse, ribbons of headlights moving and cross connecting like blood through the veins of a body impressionistic, even beautiful, but what we're hearing is soulful trumpet based music, mellow and haunting, the modern classic jazz sound of a wynton marsalis, putting a voice to our story. as credits end, we...}

<A>__{pov exterior freeway night now the music is gone, sounds are muffled and vision blurred. we get the impression of urgent movement. we hear breathing. there are voices, shouts, even screams, but muffled, far away. only the breathing is distinct. we come to realize it is our breathing, and we are inside someone, looking out. the man whose pov this is is on the edge of consciousness and not far from death. he lies on the pavement of a freeway at the site of an accident only minutes after impact. his vision goes in and out of clarity. people are swarming around him and rushing by toward the carnage of wrecked vehicles. a siren blooms in the distance and approaches haltingly. the man slips away, comes back toward consciousness, slips again. the crowd around the downed man parts to allow passage to a police officer. it is a woman, officer sharon pogue, lapd. she kneels at the man's side, taking charge, speaking, but we hear only slivers of sound. he sees her face clearly now, close above him. sharon is a dedicated professional and more. we see down into her to a place of real caring. she stares into our eyes and connects. we begin to hear her now and there are more sirens converging in b.g.}

<D>__{can you hear me?}
<P>__{(shouting, off)}
<D>__{this one's conscious!}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{paramedics on the way!}
<A>__{we are slipping away again. sharon holds us with her eyes, and she grips our hand.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{wait. wait. listen to me. can you feel that?}
<A>__{she holds on tight. we see that our hand, held in her own, is bloody.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{that's my hand. hold it. go on as hard as you can.}
<A>__{we watch our hand gripping hers, and as we hold on, the sights and sounds around us grow more clear.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{it's over, and i've got you, and you're safe. you're safe now. you got that? don't let go. don't let me go.}
<A>__{but our eyes unlock from sharon's and drift to a patch of night sky. her voice fades awawy. our pov begins to lift, moving toward that sky, as the blue black night begins to turn white. we go into that white light and...}

<L>__{exterior los angeles cityscape day}
<A>__{we pick out a police car from the traffic and follow. the beat being patrolled is a mixed neighborhood with some very rough edges.}
<L>__{interior police car day}
<A>__{officer sharon pogue is driving the car. it is two years since we saw her at the accident site. her partner, robby lewis, sips coffee and keeps one eye on the cad monitor which lists all area police calls. she slows behind a car that is crawling along, an old 60s car, driven by a young man and woman who sit very close on the bench seat. the car's engine is missing and smoking.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{that car is older than they are.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{'67 chevy impala.}

<D>__{that's what i said.}

<D>__{needs a servicing.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{don't we all.}
<A>__{robby nearly spits his coffee, laughing at what sharon has said and trying not to choke. sharon smiles, shaking her head.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{get it together, officer.}
<A>__{as robby smiles, sharon looks ahead at the young couple who each have an arm around the other. she is stroking his neck. he is making gentle circles in her hair. sharon watches this, and for a moment her eyes reveal a depth that may be loneliness, but she quickly pushes her thoughts away and hits the horn, startling robby and startling the people ahead who now disengage and drive on.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{jesus, pogo! almost spilled my coffee again! you didn't like his hair, or what?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i love elvis hair. they were going two damn miles an hour.}
<A>__{but robby's eyes have caught something on the monitor.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{let's roll to this fight in progress.}
<A>__{as robby secures that coffee cup, sharon hits the siren and speeds around the car in front of them.}
<L>__{exterior city street day}
<A>__{at the same time, a few blocks away, an old, frail man is carrying two plastic grocery bags that are too heavy for him. walking behind this man is a younger man named catch lambert, an attractive man with some scarring on his face. his eyes, deep down, are haunted by something, but there is energy in his step. he is dressed in a relaxed and stylish manner, not expensive. he begins to pick up his pace to catch up to the old man. people glance at catch, nad he glances back in an open and unflinching way, ready for anything, a smile, a nod, or because these are some of l.a.'s mean streets a threatening or taunting look. these he also meets openly, without a trace of fear. the man has been through some kind of fire, and it has left him different from us. outside the usual boundaries. catch walks beside the old man, glancing at him. finally, the man glances back, wondering and suspicious, but catch has a slight, disarming smile, open and honest.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{y'know... since we're both walking the same way, i could take one of those bags for you. that way, i do some upper body work while i'm walking along. helps my back. what d'you say?}
<A>__{the old man trudges on, proud and suspicious, too.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{right now your mind's making pictures of me robbing your groceires, but, y'know, nine times out of ten, people do the right thing.}
<A>__{the old man glances at him, still not convinced, but he soon has to stop and rest. catch stops, too. the old man looks at him, a bit embarrassed.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{it's the dog food that makes it so heavy.}
<A>__{catch nods, puts out his hand. the old man hesitates, then decides and lifts a bag, and catch takes it.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i guess it's worth it... for a good dog.}
<A>__{catch isn't kidding. he has that honesty. the old man nods and starts trudging again. as they walk on together, catch reaches for that second bag. the man relents and lets him take it. they continue on, catch carrying the bags and every now and then lifting them a bit for his upper body work.}
<L>__{exterior video game room day}
<A>__{this is the call sharon and robby have sped to. it is a chaotic scene of cops breaking up a fight between eight boys, 16 20. a big kid, 18 or so, is being pulled off another by sharon and robby. the kid is wild and resisting and sharon shows her toughness and professionalism and some anger, too, as she slams him into a fence and robby holds him while she cuffs the young man who is very mouthy, playing to his friends.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{look at this bitch. whoo! benny, look at this!}
<A>__{sharon and robby are both very good at their jobs, taking this kid to their car while other cops contain the rest. a crowd watches mostly teens.}
<C>__{kid}
<P>__{(to sharon)}
<D>__{you come in with me. hey, bitch.}
<A>__{some of his bystanders friends howl at that.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{you're going to arrest me, you come into the back seat with me. come on!}
<A>__{he resists a bit, but they're getting him into the car.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{come on. we'll have a good time.}
<L>__{interior police car day (few minutes later)}
<A>__{sharon's on the radio to dispatch as robby drives and the kid keeps mouthing off.}
<C>__{sharon}
<P>__{(to radio)}
<D>__{three adam five show us 1019 to the jail with one male prisoner.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{take off your uniform. take off my handcuffs, bitch, and come back here. i want one touch.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{give it a rest!}
<A>__{sharon is stone faced through this.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{if you're going to put me away, you gotta give me one sweet touch.}
<L>__{interior jail booking area day}
<A>__{as robby and sharon bring their suspect to the booking counter, each holding one of his cuffed arms. the kid is looking at sharon's hand on his arm.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{that ain't the touch. that ain't the touch i want.}
<A>__{they get him to the counter.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{as i remove your cuffs, i want you to put your hands here. spread your legs. more.}
<A>__{as they remove the cuffs, the kid makes a sudden move toward sharon, reaching between her legs but she was not only ready for this, but hoping for it and the stoniness of her face cracks into fierce anger as she moves quickly and grabs the kid by the hair, bringing his face into her upraised knee. he cries out and goes down on his knees, hurting and bleeding. the jailer rushes over to help, but robby grabs the kid's wrists.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{that's it. back off, john, we got it.}
<A>__{robby glances at sharon a dark glance.}
<L>__{exterior police jail parking lot day (later)}
<A>__{as robby and sharon walk to their car. they are interrupted by one of their lieutenants, sanderman, walking their way and stopping to stare at sharon. she meets his look.}
<C>__{sanderman}
<D>__{you trying to be a bad ass, pogue?}
<A>__{she is straightforward, not rebellious.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i just dealt with the situation. the prisoner...}
<C>__{sanderman}
<D>__{and you don't see a pattern here?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i want you to keep yourself way inside the line instead of walking on it. all right? are you taking notes?}
<A>__{he walks away, and sharon and robby walk on to their car she is dark; he is glancing at her.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{you broke his nose.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{he grabbed me. end of story.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{and you were waiting for him. you were hoping. you were making long range plans for his ass while he was mouthing off in the car and you're supposed to be above that shit.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{if you think i crossed the line, put it in the report.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{pogo, stop the shit. what is it? you pissed off at me, too?}
<A>__{they enter the car, sharon behind the wheel.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{not you, rob. you're a rare unthreatened male cop with a good marriage, and you like to eat where i eat so everything's code four.}
<A>__{she starts the car and starts to back out, and he reaches over and turns off the ignition. she stares hotly at him but then, slowly, she softens, takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{come over for dinner tonight. i will call charlene. she'd like to see you. it's been awhile. we'll talk about it.}
<A>__{she starts the car again, more calm, starts to drive out of the lot.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{thanks. but she'll invite friends, try and fix me up. she's always trying to fix me up so she doesn't have to worry about you and me.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{she doesn't worry about that.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{they all worry about that.}
<A>__{they both smile wryly, driving on.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{you don't need to fix me, robby, or fix me up. i don't want some guy to heart and soul me and then walk away 'cause he can't stand the cop thing or worse: he wants cop stories every night 'cause it turns him on, and he has no idea who i am inside my head. anyway, i'm busy tonight.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{got some action, huh? well, that's promising.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{yeah. hot and heavy.}
<T>__{immediate cut to:}
<L>__{interior sharon's apartment night}
<A>__{she is on the floor using an exercise rig, sliding into crunches, pushing herself, sweating, alone. we begin drifting to the rain spattered window as night sounds filter in, horns, someone shouting, a car moving by with thunderous bass music that pulses the very air and rattles the loose glass of her window.}
<L>__{exterior neighborhood streets night}
<A>__{catch lambert is walking the wet streets, head down in the rain. far away we hear that car with a bass blasting}
<B>__{radio.}
<A>__{in the glow of a street lamp, catch sees a bright colored object in the gutter. he picks it up out of the gurgling rain water. it is a small toy, a discarded superhero. he puts it in his pocket, walks on. now the car, the prowling, music blasting, bass thundering car turns a corner and begins rollling along slowly beside catch. he glances over, walking on. there are four tough looking men in the car, looking for trouble. the music is deafening. catch glances again, walks on. their eyes follow him like gun barrels. he stops and walks out on the street, moving toward the car, shouting over the music.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{hey! you want to turn that volume down? what's your point?}
<A>__{the men, incredulous, stop the car and snap off the music in order to make sure they're hearing right. they stare death at catch.}
<C>__{driver }
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{what's the point of blasting your music through the whole zip code? don't you realize there are kids trying to sleep in these apartments old people, sick people?}
<A>__{they can hardly believe this.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{you better watch your mouth, asshole.}
<A>__{catch meets the man's look with his own unflinching, haunted eyes.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{why? what're you gonna do? kill me?}
<A>__{catch's look is not a macho challenge. it's something else beyond that, a man somehow without limits. one of the riders in the backseat taps the driver's shoulder.}
<D>__{man #2 guy's nuts. let's go.}
<A>__{the driver, never breaking his death stare, snaps on the deafening music and then slowly rolls on, still glaring at catch. catch stands in the rain, watching them go.}
<L>__{interior catch's apartment corridor same night}
<A>__{catch is arriving home, soaking wet. he lives in a slightly seedy three story. as he walks down the corridor toward his apaprtment, he passes a neighbor's door and notices a set of keys dangling from the lock. he pauses and then knocks softly on the door. someone looks through the peephole and then opens the door a young single mother, friendly but with a little caution, too. she recognizes catch. behind her is a little boy, (five). the woman's name is candace. her son is tommy.}
<C>__{candace}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{hi. your keys are in the...}
<A>__{he gestures, and she sees the keys and retrieves them, more friendly now.}
<C>__{candace}
<D>__{oh, thank you. thanks a lot. god. i was trying to carry tommy and all these bags. he was so tired. of course, as soon as i put him down he had all this energy...}
<A>__{while she is talking, catch is staring deeply at the boy, who is shy. catch almost speaks to the boy, wants to, goes halfway to a smile but the sight of the kid stirs that layer of darkness in catch. he nods a good bye to the mother and is about to go. she thinks about this, as he is turning, and pushes through her remaining caution to say...}
<C>__{candace}
<D>__{y'know, we were just baking nectarine bars because the peaches weren't ripe. ever had a nectarine bar?}
<A>__{he smiles and seems to want to stay, but he is already retreating. his contact goes only so far and no further.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{sorry. gotta be going.}
<A>__{and with one more glance at the boy, he walks to his apartment, unlocks it and steps in.}
<L>__{interior catch's apartment night}
<A>__{he walks into a bare living room no chairs, tables, lamps, nothing on the walls. he walks into a spotless, never used kitchen and flips on the light, opens a drawer. in the drawer is a collection of kids' toys, some found, some purchased, mostly plastic figures. the action of opening the door has started some battery operated animals moving around in there. now from his pocket he takes the plastic superhero he just found and drops it in and closes the drawer. he walks back into the living room. he sits on the floor, leans back against the wall, his clothes still soaked from the rain. he stares at his thoughts, looking a bit numb and lost.}
<L>__{exterior interior dry cleaners shop day}
<A>__{sharon is just leaving with a clean uniform on a hanger in a plastic bag. it's a neighborhood place where alterations are done. as she is leaving, an older woman is just entering. this is mrs. vander, beaming at sharon, a real talker.}

<D>__{sherry!}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{hi, mrs. vander. you're looking good.}
<C>__{mrs. vander}
<D>__{oh, you just wait. i splurged.}
<A>__{she is pulling a new blue dress out of a shopping bag.}
<C>__{mrs. vander}
<D>__{it's for the church and the party. it's just a little too long.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{looks great.}
<C>__{mrs. vander}
<D>__{y'know, i cried over the invitation just imagine me in church.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{it'll be so good to spend time with you.}
<A>__{sharon forces a smile but is mystified. mrs. vander is walking to the counter and pausing to say...}
<C>__{mrs. vander}
<D>__{you know dan and i renewed our vows last year. i bet that's where your mom got the idea.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{their vows?}
<C>__{mrs. vander}
<D>__{your mom and dad the ceremony...}
<A>__{mrs. vander realizes what's going on and stammers on, sympathetic and embarrassed.}
<C>__{mrs. vander}
<D>__{oh, well... y'know, i just got that invitation a few... just now, so i'm sure you'll...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{oh, yeah. we've had... there's been some problems with the mail in our building, so... i will probably get it today.}
<A>__{they're both covering like mad, both realizing sharon's been left out.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{so, i guess i will see you.}
<C>__{mrs. vander}
<D>__{sure, honey. i will see you there.}
<A>__{sharon leaves mrs. vander staring after her, feeling bad. as sharon walks away, we see her forced smile die, replaced by an old pain and darkness.}
<L>__{exterior residential street day}
<A>__{robby and sharon's unit pulls up at a house remodel with a sign marked "pogue construction." sharon exits the car and walks onto the site, moves toward a man who is both carpenter and supervisor on the job. this is her brother, larry pogue, 29. they are not comfortable with each other an old wound. he gives her a wary nod. she's trying a little harder, being a bit more friendly. we can sense the strain.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i didn't see his truck, so...}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{he's not here.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{how you doing?}
<A>__{she touches his shoulder as she says this, a friendly gesture, a reaching out. he doesn't respond, only shrugs.}

<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{is he looking more like you now or did he get lucky?}
<A>__{she has broken through a bit and they both smile a brief, wry smile.}

<A>__{she looks about.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{place is coming along nice. the octagon window. dad's signature.}
<A>__{but larry's look stays on her, wondering what's on her mind.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{look, larry, i shouldn't have to hear it from mrs. vander about what's happening.}
<A>__{he turns back to his work now as they speak, uncomfortable.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{what's happening?}
<C>__{sharon}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{so you really weren't going to tell me? nobody was going to tell me? mom and dad renewing their vows, the church, the party. mrs. vander is all excited. she bought a new dress. it's blue.}

<D>__{you're still scared of him.}
<A>__{pissed, he throws his hammer down on the plywood, turns to her.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i don't think it's a good idea you coming around here in uniform. people see it, they think we're in trouble here.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{nice seeing you, too.}

<A>__{we watch moms and kids and a basketball game in the park and pick up catch walking by. two pre teens are playing bounce and catch with a rubber ball against a (tennis practice) wall, and one of them misses, and catch makes a lunge and snags the ball. instead of throwing it to one of the boys, he fires it at the wall. one of the boys catches it, bounces it off the wall toward catch. catch grabs it, and now he's part of this rapid fire game and he's athletic and funny, too, playing hard and mugging and making them smile until... a police car comes roaring down the boulevard, slowing a bit to chirp its siren a few times clearing traffic. catch glances up and sees... catch's pov sharon is in the car beside robby.}
<B>__{on catch}
<A>__{stunned by the sight of her and he doesn't know why. he can't move, can't breathe, eyes fixed on her. the police car pulls around a truck and roars on and that's when he is struck by a memory, a little like lightning. it comes as a quick flashback exterior freeway accident site catch's pov the man near death. sharon is bending close to him, this all just a sliver of an image, and it jolts him. back to scene (present) the police car is now converging with other squads just half a block away. catch throws the ball back to the boys and runs toward the police incident. the boys watch him go, wondering.}

<A>__{she walks out of the room and he follows her.}
<L>__{interior living room day}

<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{you see a pattern here, bro?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i lost my temper. things got out of hand. it won't...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{people always say that: 'i've got a temper.' like it's an excuse.}

<A>__{she comes very close to him.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{you want to hit someone? next time your 'temper' flares up, lar, and you just have to hit somebody, you go home and hit your father.}
<C>__{larry}

<D>__{i'm blaming you, you fucking coward.}
<A>__{he grabs her shirt hard.}

<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{what do you call a man who uses his wife as a punching bag?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{coward.}
<A>__{he swings a slap at her. she blocks it and punches him hard in the face, and he crashes down on the floor. kathy comes running, calling out...}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{don't hurt her, lar...!}
<A>__{kathy sees that it's larry on his ass. the little boy comes out of his room. there is a surprised moment. then kathy picks up the child and takes him back to his room. larry is sitting up, shaken, his nose bleeding. sharon goes close to him, rigid with fury.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i know how it feels, 'cause i remember. i remember standing between you and dad and taking the blows for you and for what?! you turned out to be just like him, you bastard.}

<A>__{and she leaves the house and slams the door.}
<L>__{interior sharon's apartment night}
<A>__{she is just returning home after her shift, very tired, drained. she absently turns on the tv, the stereo. she notices a blinking light on her message machine and hits the button.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{i bet you feel real proud of yourself, shar, knocking me down in front of my family. you know what i've got in my hand? i've got a polaroid picture of my busted up face, and i'm thinking of sending it to your department, to your lieutenant. i'm going to turn you in to the police, shar, and see how you like it.}
<A>__{the message ends. she stands there a moment.}
<C>__{sharon}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{oh, god. oh, shit.}
<A>__{she sits on the edge of a chair, worried, deep in her thoughts, hitting bottom the darkness engulfing her. in a moment, she looks at her desk, walks there, opens a drawer, pulls out that piece of tape with catch's number on it but it is all stuck to itself. she hesitates, then starts to pick it apart when a knock at the door makes her jump. she wonders, then, somehow, she knows. she walks to the door.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{it's you, right?}
<A>__{she unlocks and opens the door, stares at catch, very vulnerable, on the very edge, her pain and fear over larry just under the surface. catch holds a box of cookies as an offering.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{can you just shut up? just shut up and listen.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i didn't say anything.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i don't want to talk. i don't care if you have to play some game and pretend you're a... 'angel of mercy' or... whatever. i don't care, but i don't want to hear about it. all right? i don't want to hear anything.}
<A>__{she steps back, allowing him in, and closes the door and turns to him.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{it's a bad night.}
<A>__{he sees her pain and puts his arms around her, pushes through his fear and holds her and she lays her head on his chest. he embraces her fully, and the effect on him goes deep, to his core, where there is both pain and longing, but he holds on to her, even rocks her a bit. she sighs. in a moment...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{this is good... but i'm too tired to stand up anymore.}
<A>__{he walks her to the couch and has her sit, and then slowly, gently, he "disarms" her. he lifts her leg, takes the ankle holster and gun off, puts it on the table. he turns her, takes the cuffs off her belt from the middle of her back. he reaches into her pants pocket and removes the mace. from her shirt pocket he takes her i.d. shield. he has her lie down on the couch now, their faces close, eyes locked. they linger...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{you want to kiss me?}
<A>__{he looks a little lost, but he nods, helpless. he comes toward her lips finally but just before they touch, she says, softly...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{kiss me someplace i've never been kissed.}
<A>__{he's not sure what to do. he begins to look her over as if hunting, and she gets a soft smile. he starts slowly toward her ear but she shakes her head. her shirt is out of her belt and her midriff bare, and he starts to move there, but checks her with a look. she shakes her head. he hunts. her smile deepens a bit. he takes her hand and turns it over, going for the soft flesh on the underside of her forearm, and she closes her eyes. he kisses her there softly, and then again, and then he lavishes kisses from her wrist to the underside of her elbow as she sighs with pleasure and draws up her knees in a kind of sensual glow that is leading them to... no. he stops. she looks at him, a deep look, soft voice.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{why do you stop? you always stop.}
<A>__{she has a glimpse of his mystery, the old sorrow, the deep pain. he hugs her drawn up knees, closing his eyes a moment. then he sits on the couch, puts a pillow on his lap and raises her slightly, lays her head on the pillow. he strokes her hair, her scalp as she closes her eyes and sighs, slowly moving toward sleep. our trumpet music slides in here, lush and dreamy as we linger a while, and then }
<T>__{slow dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior sharon's apartment morning}
<A>__{just after dawn. catch has slept on the couch. he is beginning to awaken now as the first light strikes the windows. the dreamy trumpet fades out. catch's eyes clear, sleep replaced by thought, and he is suddenly shaken by flashback catch's pov a sliver of memory. but in this one, he is driving. we see his hands on the wheel. then his pov looks to the side and we see an asian american woman seated beside him, attractive, about his age. her name is annie. she is saying something to him. we don't hear the words. when the flashback ends back to scene (present) catch sits up on the couch, jolted. he gets another sudden flashback headlights glaring through his windshield, blinding him. he gasps, sitting there on the couch, but it's all over. he stands, rattled, and he moves toward sharon's bedroom.}
<L>__{interior bedroom morning}
<A>__{sharon is peacefully asleep. he stands over her with troubled eyes, but this slowly changes to a loving look. he bends close to her face. he feels her breath on him. he wants to lie down with her but he raises a hand and very gently brushes her cheek. she stirs. he does it again. she sighs a peaceful sigh, opens her eyes. he smiles at her.}

<A>__{pindella is moving toward the car, sharon watching him, wondering.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{drive!}
<A>__{the light changes. pindella hurries to the curb as the cars surge forward. sharon drives slowly, checking the mirror to see pindella stare after them then enter the office building on the corner.}

<D>__{will you get off this street?}
<A>__{she makes a turn, glancing at catch.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{what? you owe him money?}
<A>__{but his dark look persists, and he doesn't answer. then...}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{if you take a right and stop we can walk from here. i'd rather walk.}

<A>__{she hesitates, then falls in beside him as he walks on. they walk along in silence, the neighborhood growing more seedy, tougher as they go. catch is relaxing now, trying to push it all away. sharon looks around her.}

<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{besides the shootings, break ins, rapes, cart thefts? we've got a loose dog raiding garbage cans, knocking 'em over. can't catch him. got somebody blowing a trumpet between midnight and three. can't find him.}
<A>__{as someone approaches them, catch makes eye contact and smiles a small, friendly smile in passing. he gets a brief smile in return. he and sharon amble on. he does it again.}

<D>__{mornin'.}
<A>__{catch looks at her. she tries to shrug it off, but can't quite hide her pleasure. now catch is pausing as a woman is walking her six year old daughter to their parked car. catch makes eye contact with the girl and does a goofy wave that makes her smile. sharon smiles, too. as the girl's mother is unlocking the car, the girl shyly looks back at catch for more fun. he does that quick finger trick trying to catch his own thumb, and the girl giggles but the mother is impatient.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{go on.}
<A>__{the girl gets in. the mother is about to close the door. she frowns, mean eyed.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{move your arm!}
<A>__{the girl slides in further, and the mother slams the door. the girl follows her mother with hurt eyes as she walks around to the driver's side. catch has paused to watch this, his eyes gentle on the girl. the mother is about to enter the car when she sees catch staring.}

<D>__{shar... wait. hey!}
<A>__{but she keeps walking, and he watches her walk away. then he walks on, upset, mad at himself, trying to pound through it, walking quickly. he is passing an alley, when he hears a crash. he looks in...}

<A>__{he sees a large dog that has just knocked over a garbage can. he and the dog stare. catch walks into the alley, approaches the big dog, squats down to look the animal in the eye, and begins petting it. the big mutt is now leaning into the petting, and catch's eyes go deep and slowly find their way to a sad smile.}
<L>__{exterior city streets day}
<A>__{sharon and robby are patrolling in their unit. robby is driving. sharon is watching out the window with a deep eyed look, a bit down because of her argument with catch. she is staring as she rolls along. sharon's pov she is watching the people on the street, noticing, for once, just how isolated they are, each in a box, passing without connecting.}
<B>__{on sharon}
<A>__{watching.}
<L>__{interior catch's apartment later that day}
<A>__{we've never seen the apartment flooded by sunlight like this, all blinds open. we start in the kitchen, staring at the drawer that is now so loaded with toys, it won't shut. some brightly painted soldiers are sticking out of the drawer. in the living room there are two chairs now, and more lamps and tables. our pan reveals that the dog from the alley is sitting in the living room, watching catch whom we now see is hanging a picture on the wall a mountain scene. he holds the picture in one place, then moves it to another, wondering. his fight with sharon still colors his mood, but he's working through it.}

<D>__{i don't want you around here.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{let's go talk in the yard.}
<A>__{they stare. she starts walking back into his darkening front yard, looking over her shoulder. she walks to a tree where the tire swing hangs, waits there. he goes back inside, but leaves the door open. in a moment he reappears, coming outside, closing the door behind him.}

<A>__{as sharon comes in quietly. the church is not full, but perhaps 50 people sit in the front pews, watching the ceremony at the altar: the priest, mr. and mrs. pogue, altar boys. sharon moves forward and slips into a pew a few back from the altar. the slight disturbance of people sliding over to let her in causes a few people to glance over. one of them is kathy. they trade a brief, nervous nod. then kathy whispers to her husband...}

<L>__{exterior chapel grounds day}
<A>__{he walks into a courtyard of several small buildings in a garden setting all red brick and ivy, fountains and flowers. he is fighting his way through this, moving closer to one of the buildings. he is nearly alone on the chapel grounds, and, as he reaches the sheltered wall of this building, he is alone. this is a wall of bronze vaults within the bricks, and on each vault is a plaque a name. his breath shivers in his body as he struggles to lift his eyes. slowly, his gaze comes to rest on a name: "lambert." as he stares, the priest's voice from sharon's church fades out, and we are left with silence. catch is shaky,. he takes a step closer to the wall, to the name, to them and he tries to speak, but can't. he tries again his voice intimate, just above a whisper at first.}

<A>__{in the hushed tension that follows, a glass falls and shatters, and more people quiet down and stare. sharon looks at her glaring brother, looks at her mother nervously picking up the broken glass no support there. angry and shaken, she turns to the door. she walks to the door, opens it, starts to leave, starts to close the door behind her, and she stops, take takes a breath, battling hard against the old patterns of hurt and anger. she looks at that nearly closed door. she pushes it open and walks back in. we see a surprised and angry look from larry, a worried look from her mother but sharon is moving through the crowd, searching until she sees her father. she heads toward him. he sees her and walks into the kitchen, avoiding her. she follows him. we see larry and his mother exchange an anxious look and then move toward the kitchen.}
