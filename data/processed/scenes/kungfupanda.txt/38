<L>__{interior prison night}
<A>__{using the goose's feather to pick the lock, tai lung bursts free from his armor. an alarm rings out! the commander runs to the ledge, the goose right behind him.}
<C>__{zeng}
<D>__{what's happening?!}
<A>__{the goose looks over the edge and sees tai lung at the bottom of the pit. tai lung struggles with his shackles.}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{fire crossbows!}
<A>__{tai lung uses the incoming spears to break his shackles and then manages to kick the spears back up into the walls, creating a makeshift staircase.}
<C>__{zeng}
<D>__{tai lung is free! i must warn shifu!}
<A>__{the commander shuts the goose up.}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{you're not going anywhere. and neither is he.}
<C>__{zeng}
<D>__{let go of me!}
<C>__{commander}
<P>__{(to guards)}
<D>__{bring it up!}
<A>__{the winch turns and the elevator starts to rise. a rhino guard tries to reach it, but just misses.}
<D>__{rhino guard #1 wait! bring it back!}
<C>__{zeng}
<D>__{he's coming this way!}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{he won't get far.}
<P>__{(to guards)}
<D>__{archers!}
<A>__{leaping across the spears, tai lung catches the elevator as the volley of arrows flies down past him. the guards cut the rope and the elevator crashes back down to the bottom of the pit. tai lung swings up from the bottom of the elevator house and catches the guards by surprise. he grabs the chain and jumps over the edge and swings around, launching himself up to the next tier, disappearing into the shadows. tai lung lands on a bridge, fights his way through, finally reaching the top tier where the commander and the rest of the rhino army await.}
<C>__{zeng}
<D>__{we're dead. so very, very dead.}
<A>__{the commander hushes the goose.}
<C>__{commander}
<P>__{(to goose)}
<D>__{heh heh...not yet we're not! now!}
<A>__{archers set off charges on the ceiling. massive stalactites crash down and the bridge begins to crumble. tai lung leaps across the crumbling debris and attempts one last huge jump towards the commander. but he falls short, claws scraping and sparking against the rock wall. the commander laughs maniacally. on his way down, tai lung looks up and sees a fuse burning down to the last group of explosives. he leaps across the raining debris up to the ceiling of the cavern. grabbing a hold of the dynamite, tai lung falls and slings it ahead of him at the guards.}
<C>__{zeng}
<D>__{can we run now?}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{yes.}
