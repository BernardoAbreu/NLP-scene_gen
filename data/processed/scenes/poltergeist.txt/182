<A>__{diane is dragged across the mandibles of the spider stain and onto the ceiling. there she is slammed repeatedly, her rear end pounding the ceiling, her back arched, her head torn back from her shoulders, held invisibly by the hair. without a breather, she is then pulled across and down the opposite wall. diane is just as quickly released. she drops onto the floor. like jello are her legs. diane struggles, crawling off the bed to the door, reaching, straining to open it. mercifully “it” lets her get out. she bellows her children’s names.}
