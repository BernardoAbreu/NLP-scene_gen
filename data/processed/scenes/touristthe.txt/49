<T>__{cut back to reality:}
<L>__{interior doge's suite morning}
<A>__{frank is sleeping. a smile on his face. a shadow passes over him as somebody walks past. a man's trouser leg is visible in the foreground, moving slowly toward frank. then... clang! frank wakes with a start to see...... a waiter is setting up breakfast on a cart.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{pardone signore. good morning.}
<A>__{frank stares in surprise at the food spread out before him.}
<C>__{waiter }
<D>__{la signora ordered this for you when she left.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{when she...?}
<A>__{he looks around the suite. he is alone. he nods.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{the waiter has finished. he hovers for a moment... finally frank takes the hint and gives the man a one euro tip. he takes it with disdain and leaves. frank throws off his blanket and sits up.}
