<L>__{interior jill's flat day}
<A>__{sam bursts into jill's flat. he sees the hole in the floor. the place looks derelict. he hears an explosion and looks out of a window to see his car in flames. jill is apparently retreating from it across the forecourt. she is carrying a suitcase and bundles.}
<L>__{interior staircase day}
<A>__{sam rushes down the stairs.}
<L>__{exterior block of flats day}
<A>__{sam charges out into the open air. jill has disappeared. the messerchmidt, however, is in flames. sam doesn't know which way to turn. spotting an old mattress lying by the building he grabs it and throws it over the car in an attempt to smother the flames. the group of children watch him silently. suddenly with a great roar, jill's lorry comes round the corner at speed. sam sees that jill is at the wheel. sam runs after the lorry.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{wait! it was nothing to do with me!}
<A>__{the lorry roars away. sam dashes back to his smoldering three wheeler. he flings himself into it and starts it up. he also roars away, except that he doesn't move... all three wheels have been removed. he turns round in despair and sees the group of children regarding him expressionlessly. they include the little girl buttle. defeated, he slumps down against his charred vehicle. a shadow passes across his face. looking up he sees girl buttle standing over him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{go away.}
<C>__{girl buttle}
<D>__{her name is jill.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what? ...jill? jill who? jill who?}
<C>__{girl buttle}
<D>__{layton.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{jill layton ...}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{you're a very good little girl. what are you doing here?}
<C>__{girl buttle}
<D>__{i'm waiting for my daddy.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(uncomprehending)}
<D>__{he will be pleased when he comes home.}
<A>__{girl buttle doesn't answer and sam starts to walk away. after a few yards, the thought strikes him: he turns back to look at the little girl buttle who stands alone patiently in the vandalised wilderness.}
