<A>__{this is a beautiful open air market in a town square surrounded by old buildings. the place is packed. in the midst of it all, we make out petra moving through the crowd. she stops to look at some vegetables when xander passes by her.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{right behind you.}
<A>__{they keep talking, pretending to shop.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{so what's the plan with this ahab? are they selling it or what?}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{no, something worse. he says it's a surprise, but i know him. this is his masterpiece.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{we've got to find out what it is. can you handle that?}
<C>__{petra}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there's something i didn't have time to tell you before.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{i'm a agent as well. kgb. i've been undercover for over a year.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{you're what? what the hell have you been doing?}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{i don't know. eight months ago i stop hearing from my people. no explanation, just silence. so i stay and i wait like i was told. soon i'm in so far, they'd kill me if i left. now every day i get farther and farther away from what i was. i'm like you said, a criminal.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i'm busted up for you, but jesus, what the hell are you doing? those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.}
<A>__{this stings her. she knows well the price she paid.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{no, i guess i've been no help at all to you.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{get your head back in the game. there are lives at stake here.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{of course. i will do what i can. i have to go, before they notice.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{when can i see you again?}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{you can't, it's too risky. i'm not much help anyway, remember?}
<A>__{then she's off into the crowd.}
