<A>__{dante is staring, open mouthed, at something o.c. randal hurls the door open and immediately launches into his tirade.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{you'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(a hand up to urge him to hush)}

<C>__{randal}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{she's in here?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{this guy is going through all of the eggs. look.}
<A>__{an odd man sits on the floor, surrounded by cartons of eggs, all opened. he grabs a carton from the cooler case, pops it open, and examines each egg carefully.}
<C>__{dante }
<D>__{this has been going on for twenty minutes.}
<A>__{randal and dante study the o.c. oddity.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{what's he looking for?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{he said he has to find a perfect dozen.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{perfect dozen.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{each egg has to be perfect.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{the quest isn't going well?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{obviously not. look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.}
<A>__{the odd man holds an egg up to the light and studies it from several different angles.}
<C>__{randal }
<D>__{why doesn't he just mix and match?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i told him that and he yelled at me.}
<A>__{randal snickers at his friend.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{what did he say?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{he said it was important to have standards. he said nobody has pride anymore.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{it's not like you laid the eggs yourself.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i will give him five more minutes then i'm calling the cops. i don't need this, man. i'm not even supposed to be here today.}
<A>__{a smoker steps in.}
<C>__{smoker}
<D>__{two packs of cigarettes.}
<A>__{dante manages to break his study of the o.c. oddity and searches for the smokes. the smoker glances at randal and then at the o.c. oddity. the odd man is spinning an egg on the floor. the smoker looks at randal.}
<C>__{randal}
<P>__{(still staring at the odd man)}
<D>__{i'm as puzzled as you.}
<C>__{smoker}
<P>__{(paying dante)}
<D>__{i've actually seen it before.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{you know him?}
<C>__{smoker}
<D>__{no, i've seen that behavior before. looking for the perfect carton of eggs, right?}
<C>__{randal}
<P>__{(a bit astonished)}
<D>__{yeah. how'd you know?}
<C>__{smoker}
<D>__{i will bet you a million bucks that the guy's a guidance counselor.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{why do you say that?}
<C>__{smoker}
<D>__{i was in the food city last year when the same thing happened, different guy though. stock boy told me that the guy had been looking through the eggs for like half an hour, doing all sorts of endurance tests and shit. i ask the kid how come nobody called the manager, and he says it happens twice a week, sometimes more.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{get out of here.}
<C>__{smoker}
<D>__{i kid you not. they call it shell shock. only happens with guidance counselors for some reason. the kid said they used to make a big deal about it, but there's no pointerior}
<A>__{the odd man places a handkerchief over an egg on the floor. he quickly whisks the handkerchief away to reveal the egg still sitting on the floor.}
<C>__{smoker }
<D>__{he said they always pay for whatever they break and they never bother anybody.}
<A>__{dante, randal and the smoker stare at the o.c. man.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{why guidance counselors?}
<C>__{smoker}
<D>__{if your job served as little purpose as theirs, wouldn't you lose it, too?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{come to think of it, my guidance counselor was kind of worthless.}
<C>__{smoker}
<P>__{(grabbing matches)}
<D>__{see? it's important to have a job that makes a difference, boys. that's why i kill chinamen for the railroad.}
