<L>__{exterior la rabida monastery kitchen garden day}
<A>__{antonio de marchena, a very old man now, is taking a siesta next to his grapes. he is sitting in a simple armchair, a rosary wrapped around his fingers. the presence of someone wakes him. after a moment, he recognizes columbus and smiles. both men are very moved.}
<C>__{marchena}
<D>__{i suppose we're both old men now.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{you'll always be older than me, father.}
<A>__{they laugh. columbus sits down. bees drone lazily in the sunlight.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{have you ever forgiven me?}
<A>__{marchena nods his head.}
<C>__{marchena}
<D>__{yes. i forgave you a long time ago. you see, i was proud of you. you were like a willful child. you wouldn't accept what others told you. you had to find things out for yourself, hurting yourself and others in the process.}
<A>__{marchena looks at his plants, sighs contentedly.}
<C>__{marchena}
<D>__{do you remember when you said that people talk about the world, but never leave their gardens.}
<A>__{columbus nods.}
<C>__{marchena}
<D>__{more than ever i wonder what it is we do achieve by leaving our gardens... the world changes and yet it seems the same. we find new worlds, but fill them with the same people...}
<A>__{he pauses, looks across at columbus, smiles again gently. marchena, tiring, leans back in his chair, and looks up towards the sun.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{i have to disagree.}
<C>__{marchena}
<D>__{i knew you would.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{new worlds create new people.}
<C>__{marchena}
<D>__{oh? so you are a new man?}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{i don't know... i have the impression that i didn't change that much. i still can't accept the world as it is!}
<A>__{marchena starts laughing.}
<C>__{marchena}
<D>__{god bless you, and those like you!}
<A>__{they both laugh.}
