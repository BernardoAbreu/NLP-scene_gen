<D>__{you fucking crazy!? pull it!!}
<A>__{they're right in each other's faces. taking it way beyond the edge. bodhi's eyes are wild. a gleeful, adrenalized madness... his pupils are the entrance to hell.}

<D>__{shit!!}
<A>__{utah flings the casull away and pulls the rip cord so hard he almost loses his grip anyway. poom! the canopy cracks out. full and round and bright red. the ground roars at us. whap! utah and bodhi hit. hard. they slide and tumble down the slope of an arroyo in a cloud of dust. rocks and debris clatter into silence. nearby roach hits the ground limp as a rag doll. he moves listlessly as his chute lines tug at him but his eyes stare without blinking right at the sun. next to him the money satchel's contents are spilled right into the sand. roach's lifeless hands lie limp among the bills that caper in the desert wind. utah and bodhi are both completely still as the dust clears. finally they groan and stir. necks move, hands move, legs move. bodhi rolls to his knees. he is cut and scraped, the blood running bright down his dust covered skin. utah looks around, blinking. surreal that he should be plopped down here in the red hot mexican desert. bodhi staggers to his feet and grins at him.}

<D>__{you had me worried there, for a second, johnny u.}
<A>__{he swings up into the four by and guns the engine. rosie hops into the shotgun seat and the truck hurls up roostertails as it tears out across the desert toward roach's billowing gravemarker. johnny touches tyler's face tenderly, leaving a smear of blood. he gives her a wan version of the johnny utah grin. hold on the truck moving off in a heat shimmered cloud of dust, becoming a mirage, then a memory as we }
