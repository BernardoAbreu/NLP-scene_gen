<A>__{rafkin turns a corner and runs past two team members heading in the opposite direction.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{hey, goddamnit, you're running the wrong way!}
<A>__{they don't slow down.}

<D>__{amateurs...}
<A>__{rafkin turns a corner and realizes why the team members were running this way. a car at the end of this alley is tipped up on its bumper, its undercarriage facing them, and is moving toward them, fast. rafkin and another team member, deeper in the alley, hear the howl of the breaker behind the floating car.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{jesus h. christ! run!!}
<A>__{rafkin runs, but the team member doesn't, stunned by the sight, remains frozen. suddenly the car stops and lifts straight up into the air over him. team member's pov through ghost vision glasses the breaker comes into clear view for a fraction of a second. he's huge, seven feet tall, acromegalic, the bones beneath the skin swollen and distorted. he stares with burning eyes above a huge distended jaw. he wears, prosaically, a filthy tattered garage uniform, his name stitched above the pocket. his face, chest and arms are pockmarked with bullet holes dating from his untimely death. he takes the car that he holds overhead and slams it down. the team member dodges out of the way, but the breaker picks up the car again and slams it down again, squashing him. and then, again. and then, for good measure, once again.}
