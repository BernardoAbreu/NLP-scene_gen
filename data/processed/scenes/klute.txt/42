<A>__{spangler, a prison psychiatrist, sits on a bench eating a sandwich partially wrapped in wax paper and sipping from a carton of milk. he is obviously a man pressed for time. klute sits beside him. across from them some prisoners are taking their exercise. through the metallic netting that surrounds them, we see the skyline of new york city. it only dramatizes more the sense of being caged.}
<C>__{spangler}
<D>__{ usual case history this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty five to thirty thousand a year.}
<P>__{(notes klute's reaction)}
<D>__{oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. why?}
<P>__{(stabs at record)}
<D>__{why do you want to know all this?}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{i want to know how tom grunemann got mixed up in it.}
<C>__{spangler}
<D>__{not unusual.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{did she talk about him to you?}
<C>__{spangler}
<D>__{about his letters that's all she remembered. quite violent material, i'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. but that's not unusual either.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{has she talked with you since prison?}
<C>__{spangler}
<D>__{no. she had every good intention of it coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{i think she's trying that.}
<C>__{spangler}
<D>__{oh sure they try. the idea of a better life. but they don't really know much about life: they get confused or scared or frustrated or bored they pop back to the one thing they can handle. the trick. the trick. men in bed. not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex it avoids all that. just the trick, the transaction.}
