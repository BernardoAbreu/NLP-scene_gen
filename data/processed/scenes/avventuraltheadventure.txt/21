<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{on her way to the waiting room of the station, claudia purchases a newspaper, then goes over to an empty bench and sits down. turning to the local news section, she suddenly comes upon the article announcing anna's disappearance. a moment later, sandro appears at the door. claudia looks up at him but doesn't say a word. he walks over and sits down beside her.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{where are you going?... to montaldo's?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{then i will go with you.}
<A>__{there is a moment of silence, then claudia shows him the newspaper article.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{have you read it?... they're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{yes. i had also thought of going there to talk with them...}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{yes, you should go.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{but then when will we see each other?}
<A>__{claudia looks at him imploringly, intent on making him understand, without having to tell him outright, that it is not a question of their seeing each other. sandro, of course, does realize and suddenly springs to his feet and nervously begins pacing back and forth across the waiting room. claudia, in turn, also rises and goes over to him.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i know it's difficult. but if you go on like this it will become even more difficult.}
<A>__{the bell announcing the train's arrival is sounded. sandro turns around and faces claudia, almost with a sense of helpless despair.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{please, don't look so solemn... and don't wait for the train to come in.}
<A>__{but sandro doesn't move. and again claudia insists, imploring him not to stay, although she realizes full well that this may mean a final goodbye.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{please, please leave. i don't want to look out of the window and wave to you with a handkerchief.}
<A>__{sandro still doesn't move, and is about to say something, but claudia looks at him so pleadingly and with such a determined expression, that he finally succumbs and starts walking towards the exit behind the train tracks. the train has just pulled into the station. the platform is completely empty and claudia is the only one to board the train. she climbs up the steps and the door is closed behind her. a second later, she appears at the window, looks out briefly, then disappears into her compartment. the station master raises the signal for the engine to start, a short whistle is heard, and soon the train gets under way. sandro dashes out across the tracks, swings open one of the doors, and boards the train as it picks up speed and pulls away from the station. claudia is seated in a corner near the window, looking out. she appears completely relaxed and totally drained of energy, fatigued after so much tension. after a few seconds, she turns around and is abruptly startled to see sandro standing nearby in the corridor. he comes over to her compartment and takes a seat directly opposite to hers. claudia is absolutely furious.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{go ahead, now say something! i want to know just what it is we have to say to each other.}
<A>__{sandro remains silent, waiting for claudia to settle down and calm herself. but she continues to reproach him.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{sandro, i don't want you to come with me, i don't want to see you... how can i make it clear to you?...why did you come?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{i don't know why. i just couldn't help it.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{but sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. and it's better to do it right now.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{i have no desire to sacrifice myself... it's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... why?... for whom? if anna were here i might understand your scruples. but she's not...}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(deeply wounded)}
<D>__{oh, sandro...}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i didn't want to sound cynical. but isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{for me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago just three days ago... don't you realize? and you and anna... no, i guess they aren't like that any more. my god, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{it takes even less.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{but it's so sad. so terribly sad. i'm not used to it, i'm not ready for it... you know... i have never been so upset in my life. sandro, why don't you help me?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{i think the only way to help ourselves, claudia, is for us to be together.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{no, i'm sure it won't. move over there. let's make believe nothing happened. and when we get to the next station, get off.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{and what about you?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{me... i... i... please leave me alone.}
<A>__{suddenly, she stands up and goes into the corridor. the car is of an old type one half is first class, the other second. claudia stops in front of a second class compartment from which the sound of two voices is heard. one is that of a woman sweet, very delicate and very feminine; the other is that of a man with a sicilian accent. sandro joins claudia. standing there together they hear the conversation.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{i work there but i'm really a stranger.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{i tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{and who is she? does she work in catania?}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{yes, she takes care of the garden.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{then it's impossible for her to know me. in the villa where i'm at, we have a male gardener.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{so? that's logical. you see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{and what did they say about me?}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{they told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... in other words, things of that sort.}
<A>__{there is a moment of silence. then, the sound of music is heard coming from the compartment. claudia and sandro look at one another with a smile on their faces. then claudia leans over to peek into the compartment. the woman is young; she has thick, wavy brown hair. he is one of those typical seducers from the provinces, with black hair. there is a tiny radio between them. sandro also takes a peek into the compartment. then they withdraw as the two resume their conversation.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{we have a radio like this, too.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{no, not like this one.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{and why wouldn't we have one like this?}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{because this is a chinese radio.}
<A>__{another pause. sandro takes hold of claudia's hand and presses it. she doesn't resist, but allows him to do it.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{certainly a radio this small is very practical. it's especially useful for... i don't know... for traveling.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{but for you, what comes first: music or love?}
<A>__{claudia presses up close to sandro, amused and, at the same time, obviously moved.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{music, of course. to get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{ah, no... for me, love comes first. i'm a man, and i know what's what: first love, and then music.}
<A>__{claudia laughs but she is still very upset. all of a sudden, she starts and looks out the little window. the train is coming into a station and is beginning to slow down. claudia grabs sandro by the sleeve and pulls him through the corridor. sandro tries to resist.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{claudia, listen to me...}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{no, sandro, please... i ask you as a favor...}
<A>__{she continues to drag him through the corridor, until they finally reach the platform. then she opens the door. they are both highly emotional. claudia is almost hysterical.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{but why, claudia?... why?}
<A>__{sandro tries to grab her in his arms, but claudia pushes him away, almost with a sense of violence, as though she were afraid she might change her mind once in his arms. in the meantime, the train has come to a stop in the station. sandro pauses to look at claudia once more.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{even if you chase me away, i... claudia, let's not wait any longer... after, it will be too late ... come with me.}
<A>__{claudia is visibly battling with herself. then, in one last moment of decision, she pushes sandro towards the door and goes back into the car. once on the ground, sandro walks back and forth along the platform to see if he can find claudia, hoping she might look out the window to wave goodbye. but she doesn't appear. the train starts to move, as sandro desperately tries to catch a glimpse of claudia. but she is not to be seen. sandro starts running along the platform, but the train is now going too fast. he stops angry, disappointed and upset.}
