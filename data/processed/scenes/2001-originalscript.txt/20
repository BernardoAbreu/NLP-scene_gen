<A>__{"part iii 14 months later" discovery 1,000,000 miles from earth see earth ans moon small. we see a blinding flash every five seconds from its nuclear pulse propulsion. it strikes against the ship's thick ablative tail plate. several cuts of this.}
<B>__{another closer view of discovery}
<A>__{see bowman through command module window.}
<B>__{bowman inside discovery command module}
<A>__{he is looking for something. computer readout display showing an ever shifting assortment of color coded linear projections. we see poole in the background in computer brain centre area. after a few seconds he exits. the elapsed mission timer reads "day 003, hour 14, minute 32, second 10". bowman exits to access link airlock bright color coded doors lead to centrifuge and pod bay. large illuminated printed warnings and instructions governing link operations are seen. he presses necessary buttons to operate airlock door to pod bay.}
<B>__{pod bay}
<A>__{bowman enters pod bay and continues his search. suddenly he finds it – his electronic newspad. he exits pod bay. airlock link in the airlock link bowman operates buttons to open door marked "centrifuge".}
<B>__{centrifuge hub}
<A>__{inside the centrifuge hub bowman moves to the...}
<B>__{entry port control panel}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{hi. frank... coming in, please.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{right. just a sec.}
<C>__{bowman}
<P>__{okay. (pause)}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{okay, come on down.}
<A>__{we see the rotating hub collar at the end. behind it we see:}
<B>__{centrifuge hub}
<A>__{the centrifuge tv display showing sleepers and poole slowly rotating by. poole secures some loose gear. poole looks up to tv monitor lens and waves.}
<B>__{bowman at panel stops rotation and moves to entry port.}
<A>__{when rotation stops we see a sign lights up: "weightless condition". as bowman disappears down entry port we see him on... ... tv monitor, descending ladder. at the base of the ladder he keys the centrifuge operation panel. we see the tv picture start to rotate again. "weightless condition" sign goes out.}
<B>__{inside centrifuge}
<A>__{bowman makes 180° walk to poole. on way he passes the sleepers. we get a good look at the three men in their hibernaculums. poole is seated at a table reading his electronic newspad.}
<C>__{bowman}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{hi... how's it going?}
<C>__{poole}
<P>__{(absent but friendly)}
<D>__{great.}
<A>__{bowman operates artificial food unit, takes a tray and sits down. keys on his electronic newspad and begins to eat. both men eat in a friendly and relaxed silence. discovery in space, still nuclear pulsing earth and moon can be seen in background.}
