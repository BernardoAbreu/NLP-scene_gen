<A>__{gutterbuhg enters a large, brightly lit room. we are inside of a secret nazi headquarters. the room is filled with various communications equipment and radio transmitters. several nazi soldiers are seated before the equipment, monitoring various radio signals. an enormous glass panel covers one wall. through the panel we see two speedboats. long. sleek. high powered. mahogany hulled. both speedboats are adorned with a swastika. they float in water, in an underground, man made chamber. directly beside the speedboats, parked on a stone incline, are two automobiles. the cars are enormous, beautiful "woodies". equipped with a running board and wood panelled sides. the cars glisten. brand}

<A>__{gutterbuhg turns to klaus, a hulking nazi who stands in the corner. pointing to klaus' feet, gutterbuhg shouts an order to klaus. camera pans to klaus' feet. the nazi's boot is untied. a long string dangles on the floor. the embarassed klaus kneels and sloppily re ties his shoe. gutterbuhg turns to a nazi who sits at a radio receiver. the nazi wears headphones, listening for a transmission. the long, frightening shadow of a man overcomes gutterbuhg. he turns. fear covers gutterbuhg's face. the shadow raises its arm. heil hitler! gutterbuhg also raises his right arm. but a bizarre, mechanical squeak, is caused by the movement of his arm.}
