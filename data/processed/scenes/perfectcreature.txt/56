<T>__{slow dissolve: fade out:}
<L>__{int: sfx continuing}
<A>__{black. voices in the dark, quiet at first, then growing more frightening; then the hint of a face, in negative edgar then screams, like the screams of an animal on the hunt. and another face, alternating with edgar's. silus.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{int: hospital, lilly's ward day}
<A>__{high angle of lilly asleep, lying on a hospital bed. we drift down. again there is rain, pounding against the window. her body flinches; she is in a dream, a nightmare. as we drift closer to her, her eyes open, staring straight up and then to the left. then grim recognition. cut to low angle on silus standing above her, examining the tube that runs a clear fluid into her in a slow drip.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{antibiotics. they say it's like an animal bite.}
<A>__{silus nods. he slowly sits on the bed.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i want to thank you.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{we all caught edgar.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{i don't mean that. the blood, they say it saved my life. is it true that people who go to church are given your blood?}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{sometimes the rituals call for it. some say they have visions from it. that it restores their health.}
<A>__{silus regards her and she him. she reaches out and touches his hand, almost retracts at the smooth texture of the skin.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{so smooth.}
<A>__{she turns over his hand to reveal the wrist; the scars are almost gone from where silus cut himself.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{healed already.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{in some ways my body is like a human embryo. the cells regenerate quickly. it is why we live so long. will someone come for you? your family?}
<A>__{she releases his hand.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{i don't have one. not any more.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{influenza. my husband was quick. but my daughter, mary, her little body fought it for a long time. so i just waited. hoped. but then you realize how cruel hope is. and you just want it to end. not to stop her suffering, but to stop my own.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{i am sorry.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{do we seem pathetic to you?}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{no. fragile. worn down by nature. but you fight back.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{yes. we're good at that.}
<A>__{lilly stares up into silus' serene face. silus smiles. then stands.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{i think yours will be a good life to watch, lilly. goodbye.}
<A>__{lilly tries to smile as silus turns and walks off down the ward. close on lilly who looks grim. then she turns to the window. rain again, blowing hard against the pane.}
