<A>__{sam and suzy standing on the beach listening to the french singer's record. they face each other, bobbing their heads and tilting awkwardly to the music. suzy eventually begins to dance. sam does something vaguely like the twist. they press against each other and kiss. suzy says quietly:}

<A>__{sam and suzy kiss again. sam pushes his hands through suzy's hair and draws it back behind her ears. suzy whispers:}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{you can touch my chest.}
<A>__{sam slides his hand up under the training bra and presses it onto suzy's breast.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{they're going to grow more.}
