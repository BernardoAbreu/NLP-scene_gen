<L>__{interior marrow's office day}
<A>__{long, narrow, badly lit, it's filled with filing cabinets, stacks of unread textbooks still in publisher's plastic, a desk with computer. as soon as they enter, mary looks at the phone.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{it's for you.}
<A>__{and then the phone rings. he doesn't pick it right up, he lets it ring.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{you hear the vibrations in the wire. there's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it. i could test it.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{test it.}
<A>__{the phone still rings. marrow answers.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{yes, this is doctor marrow.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{how'd i know it was for you?}
<C>__{marrow}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{because it's my phone.}
<P>__{(back to the phone)}
<D>__{yes... mrs. dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you. see you soon. thank you.}
<A>__{he hangs up. marrow is trying to read the first file as he goes to his desk. mary shows him a huge corkboard covered with photos, articles, and various items.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{here's how they're organized. groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the kiersey temperament sorter just like you asked for. and they all score high on the insomnia charts.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{a photo of nell falls on the floor. marrow scoops it up. he holds the photo of nell up to mary, and look at the written notes and studies the graphs that go with it.}
<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{this is correct?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{her mother died two months ago. she says she really wants to do this. i didn't know if it'd be taking advantage...}
<A>__{marrow considers the lonely image for a long moment and then looks at the graph of her test scores.}
<C>__{marrow}
<P>__{(meaning the graph, not the face)}
<D>__{what a beautiful profile. how do you feel about her? what does your}
<A>__{intuition say? mary balks at his teasing.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i put my favorites on the top.}
<A>__{marrow continues to study the files.}
<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{okay... this one's good... extrovert feeler... okay... this one i like, too...}
<A>__{we don't pay as much attention now to the cork board as to other images on the wall. we find clinical looking shots from stanley milgram's experiments: subjects appearing to scream in response to electrical shock. rows of weeping prisoners in the stanford prison experiment. photos of victims crushed under the stands of a soccer stadium, the aftermath of a riot. a picture of the fuhrer before his mesmerized masses. mary opens a large envelope. she takes out a photograph that we can't see.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{what's this?}
<P>__{(has to get his attention)}
<D>__{what's this... this picture?}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{that? that's hill house.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{this is where we're going?}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{yes. it's perfect, isn't it?}
<A>__{mary studies the picture, and she can't answer him. in her glasses, we get the thinnest reflection of the photograph, a glimpse of dark brick and high chimneys.}
