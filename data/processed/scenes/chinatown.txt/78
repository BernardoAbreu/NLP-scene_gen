<L>__{exterior mulwray home dusk}
<A>__{by the pond, cigarette smoke drifts into shot. a car pulls up. in a moment cross can be seen, looking toward camera.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{there you are.}
<A>__{he walks toward gittes who stands by the pond, smoking.}
<C>__{cross}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{well, you don't look any the worse for wear, mr. gittes, i must say... where's the girl?...}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i've got her.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{is she all right?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{she's fine.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{where is she?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{with her mother.}
<A>__{cross' tone alters here.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{...with her mother?}
<A>__{gittes pulls something out of his pocket and unfolds it.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i'd like you to look at something, mr. cross.}
<C>__{cross}
<P>__{(taking it)}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{an obituary column... can you read in this light?}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{yes... i think i can manage...}
<A>__{cross dips into his coat pocket and pulls out a pair of rimless glasses.. he puts them on, reads.}
<B>__{gittes}
<A>__{stares at the bifocal lenses as cross continues to look through the obituary column. he looks up.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{what does this mean?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{that you killed hollis mulwray.}
<A>__{gittes is holding the bifocals with the broken lens now.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{right here, in this pond. you drowned him... and you left these.}
<A>__{cross looks at the glasses.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{...the coroner's report showed mulwray had salt water in his lungs.}
<C>__{cross}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{hollie was always fond of tide pools. you know what he used to say about them?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{haven't the faintest idea.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{that's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide pools... he was fascinated by them... you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. you'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. he made this city.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{and that's what you were going to do in the valley?}
