<L>__{exterior even further down the road to las vegas day}
<A>__{the hitchhiker sits nervously in the back seat as the red shark screams down the road. gonzo sings along to the tape player. the hitchhiker's eyes go to the door considers jumping out and taking his chances. duke, sweating bullets, stares at the hitchhiker in the rear view mirror.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{how long could we maintain, i wondered. how long before one of us starts raving and jabbering at this boy? what will he think then? this same lonely desert was the last known home of the manson family.}
<A>__{the hitchhiker's eyes notice a thin line of blood trickling down gonzo's neck.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{would he make that grim connection when my attorney starts screaming about bats and huge manta rays coming down on the car?}
<A>__{duke's mouth moves intermittently sometimes in sync with the words, sometimes not.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{if so well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. he'd report us at once to some kind of outback nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...}
<C>__{duke}
<P>__{(out loud to himself)}
<D>__{jesus! did i say that?}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{or just think it? was i talking? did they hear me?}
<C>__{gonzo}
<P>__{(reassuringly to hitchhiker)}
<D>__{it's okay. he's admiring the shape of your skull.}
<A>__{duke gives the hitchhiker a fine big grin and the hitchhiker giggles nervously.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{maybe i better have a chat with this boy i thought. perhaps if i explain things, he'll rest easy...}
<C>__{duke}
<P>__{(roaring over the road noise)}
<D>__{there's one thing you should probably understand }
<A>__{the hitchhiker stares at him, not blinking.}
<C>__{duke}
<P>__{(yells)}
<D>__{can you hear me?}
<A>__{the hitchhiker nods giggles terrified. duke climbs into the back seat.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{that's good. because i want you to have all the background. this is a very ominous assignment with overtones of extreme personal danger. i'm a doctor of journalism! this is important, goddamnit! this is a true story!...}
<P>__{(whacks the back of the driver's seat with his fist)}
<A>__{the car swerves sickeningly, then straightens out.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{keep your hands off my fucking neck!}
<A>__{the hitchhiker makes a sudden lunge for freedom. duke grabs}
<B>__{him back down.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{our vibrations were getting nasty but why? was there no communication in this car? had we deteriorated to the level of dumb beasts?}
<A>__{the hitchhiker struggles in panic.}
<C>__{duke}
<P>__{(to hitchhiker)}
<D>__{i want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! he's not just some dingbat i found on the strip. he's a foreigner. i think he's probably samoan. but it doesn't matter, does it? are you prejudiced?}
<C>__{hitchhiker}
<D>__{hell, no!}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{i didn't think so. because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. hell, i forgot all about this beer. you want one?}
<P>__{(hitchhiker shakes his head)}
<D>__{how about some ether?}
<C>__{hitchhiker}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{never mind. let's get right to the heart of this thing. twenty four hours ago we were sitting in the pogo lounge of the beverly wills hotel...}
