<L>__{exterior beach day}
<A>__{betsy and hector are sitting on the sea wall, watching thomas play on the beach. the sun is emerging.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{i have to ask you something else.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{why did you leave just two days before my swimming test?}
<A>__{hector is moved by the depth of her memory, her pain.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i didn't leave because it was two days before your test... it was just what your mother and i decided... i taught you how to swim... we went to the pool twice a week... why would i leave?}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{i know... that's what i mean... why did you leave just then?}
<A>__{hector looks at betsy. she is beginning to cry silently. he puts a tentative arm around her shoulder.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{oh, god, betsy. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{betsy is still crying.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{it doesn't matter.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{how did you do, in the test?}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{i passed.}
<A>__{hector leaves his limp arm on her shoulder. it is too soon for gestures of emotion. after a long moment she speaks.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{i'm a life saver now.}
<A>__{hector doesn't make the obvious comment. his emotions are full. he hides his feelings in a gruff call to thomas.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{hey, thomas! we're going home... we're having a barbecue... betsy said she'll even let me eat a steak!}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{hurry up, tom!}
<A>__{thomas breaks off from his play and runs towards them.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{don't call him tom, he doesn't like it.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{i'm allowed.}
<A>__{somehow hector is touched by this.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{your mother said it, when we split up... don't lose the children... didn't mean much at the time. but she was right.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{who said i'd let you eat a steak?}
<A>__{there is a silence. then hector speaks.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{betsy. on monday will you come with me when i take the flowers back to anna? i can't face her alone. she wants to meet you anyway.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you'll be there, right beside me?}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{i'd have to take the morning off school.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{is that bad?}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{no, that could be good...}
<A>__{betsy and hector are quite close now.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{just tell them you were with your invisible dad.}
