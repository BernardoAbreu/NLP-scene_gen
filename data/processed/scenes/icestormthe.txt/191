<A>__{ben gets out of the car, and stands on the top of an icy embankment. in a clump of bushes is the orange glow of a parka. he walks hesitantly toward it. mike's body lies face down in the wet ice. ben leans down and turns the body over, then stands back in amazement and saddened shock. he stands there for a moment, then picks mike's body up, carrying him over the hill and onto the street. we see now that he is parked just a short block from the williams's house. he bypasses his car and walks directly down the street toward the house. the effort is obviously enormous. he falls from time to time, then gets back up.}
