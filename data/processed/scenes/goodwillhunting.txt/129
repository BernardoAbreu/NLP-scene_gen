<L>__{exterior au bon pain courtyard, harvard square day}
<A>__{will and skylar sit in the open courtyard of this harvard square eatery. skylar is working on another o chem lab. will sits across from her, slightly bored watching her work.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{how's it goin'?}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{want me to take a look?}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{c'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{it's important that i learn this.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{why is it important to you? if i inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{clearly.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you're rich. what do you have to worry about?}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{rich? i have an inheritance. it's two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. that's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. this is what i'm doing with that money. i could have done anything i wanted. i could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{instead you're going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke?}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{no, so i can be a doctor.}
<A>__{a beat. will nods. she looks down, then up.}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{all right, mr. nosey parker. let me ask you a question? do you have a photographic memory?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i guess. i don't know. how do you remember your phone number?}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{have you ever studied organic chemistry?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{some, a little.}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{just for fun?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i guess so.}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." it's unnecessary. especially for someone like you.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{like me?}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{yeah. someone like you who divides his time, fairly evenly, between the batting cages and bars.}
<A>__{will laughs.}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{how did you do that? i can't... i mean even the smartest people i know, and we do have a few at harvard, have to study a lot. it's hard.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{listen, will, if you don't want to tell me }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{do you play the piano?}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{come one will. i just want to know.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i'm trying to explain it to you. so you play the piano. when you look at the keys, you see music, you see mozart.}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{i see "hot cross buns," but okay.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{well all right, beethoven. he looked at a piano and saw music. the fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the ode to joy. they had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. stone deaf. he saw all of that music in his head.}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{so, do you play the piano?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{not a lick. i look at a piano and i see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. beethoven, mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. they saw a piano and they could play. i couldn't paint you a picture, i probably can't hit the ball out of fenway park and i can't play the piano }
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{but you can do my o chem lab in under an hour, you can }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{when it came to stuff like that i could always just play.}
<A>__{skylar is awestruck with admiration for will, the robot pimp. so much so that skylar has to kiss him, then push him away.}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{i can't believe it's taken me four years to meet you and i'm going to california in two months, will.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{have you ever been to california? i bet you'd like it.}
<A>__{will freezes. a beat.}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{maybe not.}
