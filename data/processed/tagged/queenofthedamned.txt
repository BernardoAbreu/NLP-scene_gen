<A>__{slender hands with long, painted nails, gothic rings, and a half pound of silver bracelets play their instruments. long hair, body piercings, celtic tattoos, and brightly colored nylons show a lot of pale, smooth flesh. in the confusion of glimpses, it's hard to tell who's a boy or girl, but they're all young and beautiful. breaking in on the cacophony of music comes one guitar closer and louder than the rest. a scraping roar, like a bandsaw being twisted into the most gorgeous, powerful chords, almost religious in its emotion.}

<D>__{many of the references could only be derived from years of research in the bibliotech de paris, which seems unlikely for a young rock star in his early twenties. plus there are historical details dating back hundreds of years lestat describes that don't exist anywhere... except in our library. he refers to marius, the great white lord, who ruled over a group of islands off the bay of naples in the late 18th century. what i'm trying to say here, and maybe i'm not doing the best job of it, is that lestat may be the oldest and most powerful vampire ever documented!}

<P>__{(to the ancients)}
<D>__{i've had enough of this 'great family.' it's time to end it.}
<A>__{maharet steps between lestat and jesse.}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{you will not touch her!}
<A>__{akasha flicks her wrist. maharet is hurled against a pillar, pinned by akasha's hand.}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{you still think to challenge me, maharet?}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{i beg you, spare this child.}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{now.}
<A>__{maharet struggles but akasha is too strong. jesse gazes at lestat. then steps forward.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{it's all right, maharet.}
<A>__{maharet stops, standing fixed with the sound of jesse's newly strong and calm voice. jesse looks to lestat, straight into his dark irises, her gaze absolutely unwavering.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{it's what i want. i am ready.}
<A>__{she reaches up, pulls aside her shirt, revealing the top of her breast. a thin, red scar remains from where she cut herself with the silver stick from the chinese barrette. lestat gazes at her, begins to advance. jesse keeps her gaze steady into lestat's, risking everything.}
<C>__{akasha}
<P>__{(smirking)}
<D>__{how sweet...}
<A>__{lestat moves closer and closer to her, gazes into her eyes, hesitates for a moment, then continues on... jesse watches him with absolute love. he reaches her. maharet flies across the room, but akasha meets her halfway. grabs her by the hair. maharet struggles but akasha is much more powerful. jesse offers up her neck to his bite. maharet looks away and akasha looks pleased as... lestat sinks his teeth into jesse's neck. jesse gasps with the bite, but puts her arm around lestat as he draws her into him, draining her of her very life force as she holds him. with that maharet's great family mural begins to weep blood from every name. all the ancients turn, stare at the mural as... lestat drinks and drinks and jesse sighs with intimacy, clutching his neck and back, and drawing his bite deeper into her flesh. she slowly crumples to the floor, being drawn down until finally... jesse lies on the floor, eyes closed and pale. dead.}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{good bye, great family.}
<A>__{she turns to the mural with a fierce gaze. flash! it explodes, crumbling to a million pieces on the ground. maharet stares in horror.}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{now, my children, remember your real family! or else.}
<A>__{she turns to them with a killing smile.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{but, my queen, you've forgotten my reward!}
<A>__{she turns to him.}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{that's right. my king, you've just earned your crown.}
<A>__{lestat smiles with a blood stained mouth. akasha approaches lestat and offers him her vein. she looks scornfully at the others as he cradles her wrist...}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{you see how he obeys. you will or you will all die!}
<A>__{lestat looks once at marius, then sinks his teeth into its original font. he drinks as akasha gasps with pleasure at giving so much pleasure to him. she keeps smiling to the others. but lestat doesn't stop drinking. akasha looks back to him, her face changing.}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{that's enough, lestat.}
<A>__{still lestat doesn't stop.}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{lestat. enough. stop!}
<A>__{(note: scene as scripted here is quite different from what was analyzed in boards. notable potential expense or savings indicated with brackets. []) but lestat clamps down even harder. akasha thrashes, trying to release herself. maharet and marius realize what he's doing, see the chance lestat has gained for them. a silent signal passes between them as... the ancients make an instantaneous decision. akasha looks up, gasping, in time to see maharet, marius, khayman, armand, mael, pandora flying towards her. akasha lets out a hiss... most of the ancients are thrown to the ground while mael ignites in mid air. mael's skin bubbles. he screams, the veins in his face rise up and explode as if his blood were burning acid... pandora too bursts into flames. she falls to the ground. but lestat, strong with akasha's blood, keeps his hold and khayman, armand, marius, maharet fly at her again. they swarm over akasha. she rises into the air, thrashing about, but they hang on, forming a flying mass of flailing limbs. the thump of akasha's heart accelerates as they try to drain her... akasha turns on [khayman to incinerate him. flash. he screams as his blood boils, exploding out of his fingertips but he doesn't ignite... his wounds quickly heal. he moves in for another attack...] the ancients are still flung around by akasha's great strength, but they all hold on, as the thrashing finally begins to subside. the mass of bodies sinks to the ground. the ancients pull back to reveal that... akasha's skin is deathly blue white. in horror, she manages to spit out her words.}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{you kill me, you kill yourselves.}
<A>__{the ancient ones look to each other, uncertain a moment. akasha gazes at them, then turns slowly, fixes her gaze on lestat. he gazes back at her. suddenly, akasha takes her chance, rises, her eyes flare green, marshalling the last of her wrath. lestat cries out in agony as smoke rises from his limbs. fiercely determined, lestat bites into akasha's throat, this time for the kill. akasha sinks her nails into his throat. he hangs on, his teeth deep. they are locked in mortal combat. akasha slowly sinks to the ground, real fear in her eyes as her strength finally vanishes.}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{wait, lestat! you must stop!}
<A>__{lestat pulls away, leaving akasha hanging in a twisted, unnatural angle. they all stare waiting to see what will happen... ... maharet moves quickly. she strides over to akasha and sinks her fangs into akasha's neck. akasha struggles but this time she cannot even rise up. maharet does not stop. a howling sound as if from hell fills the room. the ancient ones stare at akasha, step back in awe. lestat sits up, burned but still alive to see... akasha's skin begins to grow horribly pale, to harden and cake into a chalk. there's no blood left to flow from the gaping holes in akasha's flesh. she slowly begins to transform back to her frozen statue state. her skin returning to marble. cracks multiply, becoming fissures. finally, akasha literally falls to pieces, smashing on the stone floor like porcelain. a silent moment. the ancient ones look at each other, astonished, as they realize they're still "alive."}
<C>__{khayman}
<P>__{(whisper)}
<D>__{we survived!}
<A>__{the ancients let out relieved hisses. but lestat is only concerned about jesse. he rushes to her, picks up her lifeless head, takes a dagger from the floor and slices his wrist. he brings the open vein to jesse's mouth, but she's not moving. lestat bends down to her ear and whispers.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{i left you one drop, my love. drink deep and live.}
<A>__{jesse's lips slightly move and quiver as she tastes the blood. she begins to take the blood inside her and then finally truly drink and revive as lestat cradles her. she pulls away, gasping. lestat looks into her eyes.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i thought i'd lost you...}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{drink, my love.}
<A>__{her lips move to his wrist. lestat strokes her hair, soothes her. jesse gasps as pain courses through her. lestat holds her close. she looks up at him, their eyes are locked together.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{i will never leave you again.}
<A>__{he holds her tight in his arms. all the ancients gaze at lestat, now understanding what he did. slowly jesse rises, gazes at lestat, her face pale, her eyes glowing. then jesse turns, stares at maharet. all the ancients turn, follow her gaze. a whiteness is spreading across maharet's face and skin. maharet stares at her arms and legs, slowly turning to stone. jesse goes to her.}

<D>__{maharet...}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{my child, let me look at you... you are finally happy. it is as it should be now... i will watch over you always.}

<P>__{(a reverent whisper)}
<D>__{she took akasha's last drop, took akasha's death into herself. behold, our queen... our new mother...}
<A>__{the ancients slowly bow to maharet. jesse slowly slips from maharet's arms. goes into lestat's arms.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{is she... dead?}
<C>__{khayman}
<D>__{no, she will live forever. she sleeps. she sleeps, and dreams of us.}
<A>__{jesse and lestat hold onto each other, gazing at maharet's face. on maharet's lips is the most content of smiles. jesse wipes away a tear. marius turns to lestat. their eyes meet. then marius bows at maharet's feet.}

<C>__{jesse}
