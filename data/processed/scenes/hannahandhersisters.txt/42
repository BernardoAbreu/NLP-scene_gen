<A>__{manon lescaut is being performed. onstage, the soprano in the title role sings a mournful aria as she kneels by the ruins of a wagon. the background is dark. the film moves up to the private boxes in the upper loge. david and holly can be seen from a distance sitting in one of the boxes. david glances at her; he reaches down for a bottle of wine. the movie briefly cuts back to the stage. the soprano is leaning on a wagon wheel; her voice soars. then it's back to a closer look at holly and david in their box. the aria continues as david hands a smiling holly a glass. he uncorks the wine and pours some in both their glasses. holly mouths a thank you, glancing around. they look at each other and raise their glasses in a toast.}
