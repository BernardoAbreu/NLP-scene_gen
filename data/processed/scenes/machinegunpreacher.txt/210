<A>__{sam sitting outside his tukul alone, tearing open an airmail package and pulling out another videocassette, slides it into his videocamera, hits play on the small screen we see a school production... children dressed in costumes shuffling across the stage... lines being spoken by rote...and then the awkward entrance of paige speaking her lines... but instead of finding joy in this sweet moment he finds heartache... the distance from his family... from their innocence... simply too great to bear in this moment... ... and then he hears giggling... and he realizes two young orphan boys have snuck up behind him and are looking at the screen over his shoulder... and sam holds it up so they can see better and now more children gather around maybe 10 or 15 kids pointing at the small screen... giggling and chatting in arabic...}
