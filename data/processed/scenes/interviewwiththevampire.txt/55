<A>__{lestat enters.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{she's here, your wounded one.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what are you saying?}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you need company, louis. more congenial than mine...}
<A>__{lestat holds up a candle and walks towards a large four poster bed. claudia lies there, angelic, under the coverlet, two marks on her neck.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{lestat!}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you remember how you wanted her, the taste of her }
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i didn't want to kill her.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{don't worry, louis, you're conscience is clear. you left her alive.}
<A>__{lestat shakes her gently.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{claudia, claudia, listen to me. you're ill, my precious and i'm going to give you what you need to get well.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{lestat, what do you mean?}
<A>__{louis runs at him, but lestat brushes him aside effortlessly, so he falls to the floor. lestat bites his wrist and presses the bleeding wound to the child's mouth... he winces in pain.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{that's it dear. more. you must drink it to get well.}
<A>__{claudia sucks on the wound, reviving, making little noises like a person waking from sleep. louis rises to his feet as claudia clutches lestat's arm, sucking the blood fiercely. lestat moans.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{stop, that's enough. no more.}
<A>__{he pulls her loose and she growls and stares at him with big clear astonished eyes.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i want more.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what have you done?}
<A>__{lestat puts her down on the bed and sits beside her, holding his wrist, obviously in pain.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{more.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{yes, cherie, of course you want more. and i will show you how to get it. you drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? never again.}
<A>__{still suffering, lestat pulls the bell rope.}
<B>__{close on claudia}
<A>__{being transformed. becoming white yet robust, bright eyed yet crazed. she shakes her beautiful curls and the dust falls from them. they are shining in the candlelight. louis cannot stop looking at her. he does not notices as the maid enters.}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{ah, quelle belle enfant!}
<A>__{the maid comes near the bed, kneels in front of claudia. lestat lays his hand on the maid's throat and claudia watches keenly.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{gently, cherie. they are so innocent. they must not be made to suffer.}
<A>__{claudia lunges for the throbbing vein in the neck, locking on to the flowing blood. the maid is transfixed. close on louis, his anguish, his fascinated horror.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you are the devil! you are the instrument of satan!}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{that's enough, cherie. stop before the heart stops.}
<A>__{he lets the dead maid onto the floor. claudia looks at the corpse.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i want some more.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{it's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. my child. my beloved child.}
<A>__{lestat and claudia sit on the louis xvi settee. claudia is a vision, a doll made out of pearl. animated, voice crisp.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{where is mamma?}
<A>__{the words echo in louis' head, as he puts his hands to his ears.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{mamma's gone to heaven, cherie, like that sweet lady over there. they all go to heaven. and you did very well, cherie. not a drop spilt. very good! you're going to be our child now.}
<A>__{lestat takes out his comb and begins to comb her hair.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{your mama's left you with us. she wants you to be happy.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{you are the devil! you are the instrument of satan!}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{shhhh! do you want to frighten our little daughter?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i'm not your daughter.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{yes you are, my dearest. you are mine and louis' daughter. you see louis was going to leave us. he was going to go away. but now he's not. he's going to stay and make you happy.}
<A>__{claudia runs over to him. she smiles at him.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{lou...eee...}
<A>__{louis is conflicted. he cannot leave her. he touches her cheeks, her hair. same as his. vampire skin and hair. he draws in his breath, shocked by her beauty, then he embraces her as a father might a daughter. he looks over her shoulder to lestat.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you fiend. you monster.}
<A>__{lestat smiles}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{one happy family.}
