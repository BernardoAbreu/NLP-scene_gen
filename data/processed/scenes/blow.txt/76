<D>__{i don't know, diego. i've got a good thing going already. everybody smokes pot. it's easy. cocaine is a rich man's drug. it's too expensive.}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{no, no. that is where you are wrong. for us, it is cheap. in medellin, we buy for six thousand dollars a kilo. in miami, we sell for sixty.}
<A>__{george's interest is piqued.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{that's over fifty thousand dollars profit per kilo.}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{and that's wholesale. cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three hundred thousand.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh my g d.}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{yes. and a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. everything is the same, george, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{jesus christ. jesus fucking christ.}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{now do you see what i am saying?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{getting it here is no problem. trust me. i will fly it in myself if i have to. what about supply? how much can we get?}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{don't worry. we will talk of everything. we have the time. you arrive here with a bachelor of marijuana, but you will leave with a doctorate of cocaine.}
