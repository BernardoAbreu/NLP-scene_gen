<L>__{interior slayers battleground #2 2nd floor}
<A>__{kable takes up a spot from a second level vantage point from here we see a small group of blues moving down the block, scanning for survivors.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{wul hello thar...}
<A>__{kable watches himself switch turrets on his weapon. he brings up a sniper sight and locks in on a target.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{wait for it...}
<A>__{close up of kable's ear: just then he hears the subtlest of sounds creeping up behind. whoever's controlling him doesn't seem to have noticed he's too focused on the enemies in the sights. we can see the tension in kable's face he's helpless, trying to fight it, willing his player to take notice.}

<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{turn me around god damn it...}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{what'd he say?}
<A>__{a trickle of sweat runs down into kable's eye. the sound is more distinct now, closer... he's practically shaking from the struggle to overcome the control. pov: someone has reached the top of the stairs... kable, seen from behind, comes into view crouched by the blown out window.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{my boy gotta take a piss or something?}
<A>__{finally: snap zoom on a reflection in a shard of hanging window glass the outline of a blue, raising his gun...}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{d'oh.}
<A>__{kable spins fast. the turret is already revolving when he squeezes the trigger... the armor piercing shell takes sneaky blue by surprise, blowing him out the back of the building... the blues in the street take notice. it's a matter of seconds... kable makes a run for it as the floor starts to disintegrate behind him in a shitstorm of bullets. shrapnel drills his back, absorbed by the body armor.}
