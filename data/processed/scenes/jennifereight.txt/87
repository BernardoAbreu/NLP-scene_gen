<L>__{87: exterior landscape. country road. day.}
<A>__{wide over the countryside. the car is a long way off. a pretty magic looking dawn. cows on hills and mist in the hollows. the mercedes finally arrives. up the track and into the (refurbish ed) garage. engine off and little but a sound of singing birds.}
<L>__{88: interior living room. berlin's house. day.}
<A>__{helena sits on the sofa. she's a lousy liar and having a tough time with the phone " .. my aunt called twice .. well, soon, i hope so .. right now, i'm scared to be there .. who? .. just a second .. ok. .. just a second.. goodridge wants the number?" she seeks decision from berlin who doesn't want him to have it.}
<C>__{helena }
<D>__{mr goodridge? .. i can't find it .. no .. there's no one here to read it right now .. well, yes, i know .. of course i will .. yes, promise .. i will get it and call you tomorrow ..}
<A>__{and that's it except for "goodbyes." he takes the phone and re places it. her expression is a toss up between guilt & anxiety.}
<D>__{i feel really bad about it, coz they invited me for christmas ..}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{has he got your aunt's address?}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{i don't think so .. he said the police had been calling .. want ed to ask me some more questions ..}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{who?}
<P>__{(she doesn't know)}
<D>__{probably angelo .. i will take care of it .. don't worry, we 're gonna find this guy, and everything'll be ok. .. ok.?}
<A>__{only thing he fails to mention is which guy he's talking about. anyway the subject is already changed. he notices tapes in her bag. "would you like me to put your music on?" no, she doesn't want music. ok. he's gonna light the fire and make them lunch.}
