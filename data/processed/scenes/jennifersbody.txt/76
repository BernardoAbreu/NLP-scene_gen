<L>__{exterior our lady of perpetual blood cemetery day}
<A>__{we're in a small catholic cemetery. a small, neat gravel path runs through the stately old monuments into a small valley where a funeral is taking place. faint moaning and sobbing can be heard. then, a procession of 6 or 7 goth emo kids appears on the crest of the hill. they move forward into the cemetery, flamboyantly dressed in black capes, chains, cloaks, neon hairpieces, fishnets, mesh, 18 hole combat boots, etc. these are colin gray's friends. one girl scatters blood red rose petals dramatically on the path as she stumbles along, weeping. at the bottom of the hill, colin gray's very conservative looking family stands next to the fresh grave, surrounded by sympathetic mourners. needy stands near the back, looking shell shocked. there are also a few press photographers snapping photos, and of course, a catholic priest.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{we gather here today to celebrate the life of colin gray, who was plucked from the prime of...}
<A>__{the priest and family are momentarily distracted by the motley crew of goths descending on the funeral. the priest clears his throat disapprovingly.}
<C>__{priest }
<D>__{what is this disturbance?}
<C>__{mr. gray}
<D>__{these are colin's friends.}
<A>__{a goth boy runs up to the grave and drops to his belly.}
<C>__{goth boy}
<D>__{colin! take me with you! i belong down there! in the daaaarkness!}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{no, kevin. those are just his fleshly remains. he's among the dark angels of the realm now. fly, colin. fly into the firmament.}
<A>__{she lights a bundle of sage and waves it in the air. colin's father gags, appalled.}
<C>__{goth boy}
<D>__{is it cool if we camp here for a few days? we want to commune with his corpse. he was our spooky homeboy.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{children, this is a private service for family only.}
<C>__{goth girl}
<P>__{(to colin's mother)}
<D>__{oh, right. i need to ask you something, mrs. gray. it's really important for me to have closure.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{young lady, have some respect for this family...}
<C>__{mrs. gray}
<P>__{(waving him off)}
<D>__{no. it's fine.}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{is it true that colin had a date with jennifer check the night he was killed?}
<A>__{she says "jennifer check" as if it were the most disgusting name imaginable. needy covers her face.}
<C>__{goth girl }
<D>__{because jennifer check is a social disease. she's not like us. she thinks she's so special just because she's popular and and is what "society" considers "attractive." but she's not sincere. she's about as emo as a breast implant! and she listens to jessica simpson and shops at hollister. and i just know colin would never go out with someone like that, and i just need confirmation. from you. so did he?}
<C>__{mr. gray}
<D>__{did he...?}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{have a date with jennifer check.}
<A>__{colin's parents stare at the ground.}
<C>__{goth girl }
<D>__{oh god. oh god. i knew it! that bitch! i will erase her! i will put a freaky druid spell on her!}
<C>__{goth girl }
<D>__{i will spell her preppy ass right into the ground!}
<A>__{the parents flinch.}
<C>__{goth boy}
<D>__{um, chloe? maybe you should be mad at the person who murdered colin. all jennifer check did was invite him over to watch aquamarine.}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{that's worse!}
<A>__{she throws herself to the ground, crying and pounding the dirt like a toddler. colin gray's mother buries her head in her hands and begins weeping. mr. gray attempts to comfort her.}
<C>__{goth boy}
<D>__{colin wouldn't have liked this.}
<C>__{mrs. gray}
<P>__{(losing it)}
<D>__{oh, you think so, powder? yeah, you're right! i'm pretty sure my son wouldn't have liked being eaten by a fucking cannibal and buried before his eighteenth birthday! wow, you must have known him so well!}
<C>__{mr. gray}
<D>__{jill...}
<A>__{the goth boy looks terrified. but mrs. gray's not done ranting yet.}
<C>__{mrs. gray}
<D>__{by the time they found colin in that godforsaken house, he looked like lasagna with teeth. i'd know i had to identify the remains. my boy's not in the realm of the undead. he's not flying around in the firmament with magical wings of flame. he's in an overpriced rosewood box that's headed six feet downtown.}
<A>__{she kicks the coffin to illustrate.}
<C>__{mrs. gray }
<D>__{so you can take your pain and shove it up your asses, kids. i got the monopoly on pain!}
<A>__{the kids stare at her in awe. needy watches as mrs. gray collapses into mr. gray's arms.}
