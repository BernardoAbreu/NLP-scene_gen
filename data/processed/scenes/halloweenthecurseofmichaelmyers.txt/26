<L>__{interior loomis's cabin night (same)}
<A>__{lightning flashes and rain pelts the windows of a bucolic cabin. this is a man's retreat and has been for years. dark wood, worn leather, a few tastefully chosen antiques. floor to floor ceiling shelves containing a myriad of books and an impressive display of awards and degrees, all bearing the name: samuel j. loomis, ph.d. after a station identification, "the harry simms show" resumes, tinny voiced callers blaring over a handsomely restored 1928 bremer tully.}
<P>__{male caller #3 (v.o.)}
<D>__{all these fanatics aside, harry, i'd personally like to thank whoever did the masked one in. saved us tax payers a lot of money in the long run.}
<P>__{female caller #3 (v.o.)}
<D>__{yeah, that sucker's been dead for six years. it's about time they had a halloween revival in this town. now my kids can stop driving me crazy!}
<A>__{move in behind a bald, sharp featured man, hunched over a can as he reminisces over a collection of framed photographs memories of his wife and children.}
<P>__{male caller #4 (v.o.)}
<D>__{what happened to that psychiatrist of his? loomis, i think was his name. i heard the old quack was dead.}
<A>__{turning at the mention of his name is dr. loomis himself, wearing spectacles, a comfortable sweater and his trademark goatee. for the first time ever, we actually see him smile. the burn scars on his face have all but faded away. last traces of the horrid past.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{not dead. just very much retired.}
<A>__{loomis hobbles to the desk and finishes cutting out a newspaper article. as he arranges the strips of paper in a leather bound scrapbook, a sudden knock at the door gives him a startle.}
