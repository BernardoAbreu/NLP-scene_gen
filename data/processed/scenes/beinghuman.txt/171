<L>__{exterior beach dusk}
<A>__{it is a calm dusk. hector is turning the meat on the barbecue. he is in a splendid frame of mind.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{ah... smell it... the smell of civilization... scorched meat...}
<A>__{hector serves the chicken onto their plates. he sits down beside them with his steak, and a glass of wine. he watches thomas attack his chicken, and smiles.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i'd forgotten that... how you eat... dedicated... like it's your religion!}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{things i like.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you used to hum to yourself too, when you ate... like everything was fine with the world.}
<A>__{thomas tries it out, eating and humming. it feels good to him. his head nods with the chewing and the tune.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{hey, so i did... i'd forgotten about that...}
<A>__{the early stars are appearing in the sky. hector lifts his eyes to a bright point low on the horizon.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{there she is... old mercury...}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{no... mercury doesn't rise 'til after midnight... that's jupiter...}
<A>__{hector is impressed by his son.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i'd forgotten... we used to watch the stars... you could tell me the names of all the planets... you could recite them like a poem... remember... at the tiny window upstairs in the old house?}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{oh well, not to worry. i'm glad you still like astronomy though.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{i'm not into star gazing so much ... we're working on computer modelling... we're trying to make a biosphere...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{uh huh?}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{a self sustaining life system... for inter stellar travel. but we always get a methane build up, it doesn't matter what we do...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{this is at school?}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{yeah. we're making such a mess of the world, one day we're going to have to take off for somewhere else...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{sounds like donald said that...}
<A>__{hector realizes how far his kids have travelled from him. he looks at them.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{well, i'm glad you two are thinking about the old planet. i'm proud of you. look how beautiful everything is. sometimes i think it's people that make it all wrong... we walk around with all our problems...}
<A>__{betsy chimes in.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{i don't know. if it wasn't for us there'd be nobody around to see it all.}
<A>__{hector stands to fetch another baked potato from the fire. we see the three of them in a wide shot, the evening sky now pulsing with more and more points of light. hector's voice and laughter carry to us.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{don't worry, you two... i will tell you... it's just a big, black sheet up there with holes in it so the light comes through... that's the truth... the very latest...}
<A>__{hector has come to rest, and found peace at last, however temporary, here on the beach, beneath the same stars that our first hector wailed at six thousand years ago. on monday he will face the music. the kids will go back home, mrs. philippopolis will have to be dealt with, and the wilting three hundred dollar bouquet of flowers. in general, life will take over, on monday. but at this moment of calm on the beach, let's leave him while he's ahead. their voices ring out playfully across the expanse of darkening beach and light laden sky.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{wait a minute... i know... the whole universe is inside a speck of dust that's lying in a ball of fluff in the cuff of a pair of pants hanging over the back of a chair...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{no... i will tell you... the whole thing... stars and everything... is sitting on the skin of a bubble of milk in a bowl of cornflakes... and somebody's just about to eat it...}
<A>__{the three of them are laughing now.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{skimmed milk...}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{you don't get bubbles in skimmed milk...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{okay... it's half and half...}
<A>__{perhaps that's just about as close as hector and his tribe of humans will ever come to working it all out. but they try.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{i've got a better one... we're all inside a speck of pollen that's stuck to the wing of a bee while it sits on a flower...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{don't mention flowers, betsy... please, not tonight.}
<A>__{and then, after a long, long pause.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i have an idea, betsy... we're inside a pancake... what d'you think?}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{why are you always talking about pancakes... what's wrong with you?}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{you've got pancakes on the brain.}
