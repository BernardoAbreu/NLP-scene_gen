<D>__{pauly, know it sounds corny but i miss you so much! wish you could have come. saw some dolphins today. frisky little buggers. they were even playing our song in the bar. have been pondering about your question, and i think my answer is "yes." after all, it's no fun in the sun without... margaret (o.s.) (cont'd) paul, you ready?}
