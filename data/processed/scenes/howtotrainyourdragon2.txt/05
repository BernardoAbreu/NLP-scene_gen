<L>__{exterior lapland woods trapper's fort moments later}
<A>__{(scene 0400 shot down!) hiccup and toothless fly over the fjord, winding deep through undulating crimson and gold forests. astrid and stormfly catch up as the autumn colors suddenly give way to charred timbers. they fly deeper, through ash and wafting smoke. ahead, in a sheltered harbor, an explosion of ice stands as an eerie marker of what used to be a trapper's}
<B>__{fort.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{stay close.}
<A>__{they fly through the suspended remains of the buildings, splintered, and frozen in mid destruction.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{what happened here?}
<A>__{it's at once harrowing and puzzling. toothless spots an enormous dragon footprint in the muddy shoreline below, leaving him uneasy.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{easy, bud.}
<A>__{as they crest the ice formations, astrid spots a crew of men at the stern of a moored ship below.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{hiccup!}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{fire!}
<A>__{the men fire a stern mounted cannon. the projectile unfurls into a net. hiccup and toothless dart out of its way.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{astrid! look out!}
<A>__{it hits stormfly, tangling her wings and causing her to spin uncontrolled. astrid struggles to free her as they hurtle toward a collision.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{hiccup!}
<A>__{astrid falls off of stormfly, but toothless snatches her at the last second. stormfly hits the ground, tangled in the net. trappers rush out of hiding, piling onto her with ropes and weapons. she whips her tail, sending spikes flying.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{watch the tail!}
<A>__{a large, raven haired trapper lunges over the spray of spikes and lands upon stormfly's head, twisting it and taking her down like a rodeo cowboy.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{tie those legs up!}
<A>__{eret deftly ties her gnashing jaws shut, wrangling her into submission clearly a pro among pros. he looks up, revealing a handsome face and gleaming, intelligent eyes that search the sky as toothless' tell tale banshee scream rings out.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{is that what i think it is?}
<A>__{toothless suddenly streaks across the sky, banking and landing with a ferocious roar.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{stop!}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{stormfly!}
<P>__{(to the trappers)}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{astrid and hiccup leap off of toothless, rushing toward stormfly. eret's men immediately draw weapons. hiccup extends and ignites his dragon blade a telescoping fiery sword impressive enough to wow eret's men.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{back again?}
<A>__{eret steps forward, focused only on toothless.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{soil my britches... that is a night fury. thought they were all gone for good.}
<P>__{(to his fellow trappers)}
<D>__{looks like our luck's had a turn for the better, lads! don't think drago has one of those in his dragon army.}
<A>__{his men sound out in agreement. hiccup eyes astrid, confused.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{dragon army?}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{look, we don't want any trouble.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{ha! you should've thought of that before you stole all of our dragons and blasted our fort to bits!}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{wait...}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<A>__{astrid and hiccup take in the icy destruction, putting it together.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{you think we did this?}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{dragon trapping is hard enough work as it is, without do gooder dragon riders sneaking in to rescue them.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{what do gooder there are other dragon riders?}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{you mean, other than your thieving friend from last night? you tell me.}
<A>__{eret approaches. toothless snarls, protectively.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{you may have an ice spitting dragon on your side, but we still have a quota to fill. how do you suppose we explain this mess to drago bludvist?}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{drago what fist? does anything you say make sense?}
<C>__{teeny}
<D>__{he's expecting a new shipment of dragons for his army by tomorrow. no name and drago don't take well to excuses.}
<A>__{eret parts his tunic, revealing a large branding iron scar on his torso, in the shape of a dragon skull, split by a sword.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{this is what he gave me last time i showed up empty handed. he promised to be far less understanding in the future.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{look, we don't know anything about a dragon thief, or an ice spitting dragon, or your lunatic boss and his dragon army, okay?}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{just give us back our dragon, and we'll go, strange, hostile person whom we've never met.}
<A>__{eret bows playfully.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{oh, where are my manners? i'm eret. son of eret. finest dragon trapper alive.}
<A>__{he pulls a dagger from behind his back, waving it cockily. his men ready their weapons and net cannons.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{after all, it's not just anyone who can capture a night fury.}
<A>__{toothless roars a warning.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{and this is toothless. he says we're going. now.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{heh. they all say that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{rush `em, lads!}
<A>__{eret lunges toward them. toothless blasts, bringing down a massive spire of ice. it shatters as it hits the ground, forcing eret and his men to dive out of the way. making quick use of the distraction, hiccup re ignites his dragon blade and slashes through the ropes binding stormfly.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{stormfly! c'mon, go! go!}
<A>__{eret gets to his feet in time to see toothless and stormfly take to the air, carrying hiccup and astrid out of reach of the volley of arrows.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{you will never hold on to those dragons, you hear me?! drago is coming for them all!}
<A>__{i e. berk blacksmith stall sunset (sequence 0500 lock down!) the gang joyrides past gothi's house, scattering her assortment of terrible terrors. she waves a fist at them as they sweep past, whooping and chortling, leading us down to... the upper plaza, where a gathered crowd of vikings and their dragons are cued up outside of gobber's blacksmith stall, awaiting their turns. stoick maneuvers through the crowd, spouting jovial greetings in passing. he makes a bee line for gobber, who is busily grinding a metal dragon tooth into shape. a zippleback waits patiently, his head cocked open like a car hood while the other head watches, sympathetically.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{any sign of him?}
<A>__{gobber flips up his welding guard, revealing a matching area of unsoiled skin.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{ah, he's probably flown off the edge of the world by now. you sure you want that kid running the village? you can still delay your retirement.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{oh, he's ready. you'll see.}
<A>__{a sudden excitement in the crowd heralds hiccup and astrid's return. they touch down on toothless and stormfly.}
<C>__{stoick }
<D>__{haha! there he is!}
<P>__{(to gobber, proving his point)}
<D>__{huh? the pride of berk!}
<A>__{hiccup stows his helmet and heads toward stoick with urgency.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{who finally decided to show up for work. yay.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{sorry. got held up.}
<P>__{(privately, to stoick)}
<D>__{hey, dad, could i have a word?}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{something you're itching to tell me?}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{not quite the itch you're thinking of, but yes.}
<A>__{stoick hands him an apron and guides him to the front desk.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{good man! now, lesson one. a chief's first duty is to his people. so...}
<A>__{stoick changes the rune on the "being served" placard.}
<C>__{stoick }
<D>__{forty one? forty }
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{could we just talk in private for }
<C>__{starkard}
<D>__{ that's me! that's me! i'm next!}
<P>__{(pushing his way through)}
<D>__{i was ahead of you! excuse me, i've been here all day!}
<A>__{starkard reaches the counter, giddy with excitement.}
<C>__{starkard }
<D>__{okay, i want one of those high seaters, with lots of spikes and a big stowage compartment.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{absolutely! you got it, sir!}
<A>__{stoick spins hiccup around, steering him back into the shop.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{dad, this is actually a little more important than building saddles.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{ah ah! lesson two. no task is too small when it comes to serving your people. excuse us, grump.}
<A>__{they step over the tail of a large, snoring oaf of a dragon, stirring him awake with a fussy start.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{grump! you let the forge die down again!}
<A>__{grump coughs a slug of molten lava into the forge. it splatters everywhere, igniting a rash of fires. hiccup side steps them as he gathers materials in the back of the stall. gobber pulls the fire extinguisher, dumping water everywhere.}
<C>__{gobber }
<D>__{that's it, grump. you're going up for adoption!}
<A>__{stoick fills a toolbox with tools from hiccup's workbench.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{one of these. and this...}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{dad }
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{ there you go! go on. have away.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{but, seriously, i really need to tell you about this new land we came across.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{another one?!}
<A>__{fishlegs walks in, followed by the twins and snotlout.}
<C>__{fishlegs}
<D>__{any new dragons?}
<A>__{stoick slaps a sheet of leather onto a dragon mold, and hands hiccup pencil. exasperated, hiccup begins tracing an outline as he speaks.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{we didn't stick around to find out. these folks weren't particularly friendly.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{oh, really? your night fury and deadly nadder didn't bring them cheering to the rooftops?}
<A>__{gobber spins his prosthetic arm dispenser.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{no, this was different. not the standard run for the hills hoo ha i've come to enjoy. these guys were trappers. dragon trappers.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{you should've seen their fort. all blown apart and stuck in giant spikes of ice. it was weird.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{i've never seen anything like it. and worst of all, they thought we did it!}
<A>__{gobber pops off his prosthetic tongs and selects a wire brush from his dispenser...}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{y'know, you two are gonna get yourselves in serious trouble one of these days. not everyone appreciates this way of life.}
<A>__{which he uses to brush his mustache and eyebrows. stoick takes the sheet of leather to the table saw...}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{gobber's right, son. best we keep to our own. besides, you'll have more important uses for your time }
<A>__{and pulls a lever, starting it up.}
<C>__{stoick }
<P>__{(sing songy, under his breath)}
<D>__{once we make the big announcement!}
<A>__{hiccup pulls the lever, shutting the saw down.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{they are building a dragon army.}
<A>__{silence fills the stall. vikings exchange worried glances.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{or at least the guy they work for is. dargo bloody fist or something.}
<A>__{stoick's eyes widen. he turns to gobber, with growing alarm.}
<C>__{tuffnut}
<D>__{i will bloody his fist with my face if he tries to take my dragon!}
<C>__{ruffnut}
<D>__{or mine.}
<C>__{tuffnut}
<D>__{you're such a moron.}
<C>__{fishlegs}
<D>__{a beautiful moron.}
<C>__{snotlout}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{ruffnut grumbles, revolted by their advances. stoick grabs hiccup by the shoulders, wide eyed and intense.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{bludvist? drago bludvist?}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{uh, yeah. wait. you know him?}
