<C>__{heywood}
<D>__{couldn't play somethin' good, huh? hank williams?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{they broke the door down before i could take requests.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{was it worth two weeks in the hole?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{easiest time i ever did.}
<C>__{heywood}
<D>__{shit. no such thing as easy time in the hole. a week seems like a year.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i had mr. mozart to keep me company. hardly felt the time at all.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{oh, they let you tote that record player down there, huh? i could'a swore they confiscated that stuff.}
<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(taps his heart, his head)}
<D>__{the music was here...and here. that's the one thing they can't confiscate, not ever. that's the beauty of it. haven't you ever felt that way about music, red?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{played a mean harmonica as a younger man. lost my taste for it. didn't make much sense on the inside.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{here's where it makes most sense. we need it so we don't forget.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{forget?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{that there are things in this world not carved out of gray stone. that there's a small place inside of us they can never lock away, and that place is called hope.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{hope is a dangerous thing. drive a man insane. it's got no place here. better get used to the idea.}
<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{like brooks did?}
