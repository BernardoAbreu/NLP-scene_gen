<A>__{shows the hose snaking wildly and jumping. at one moment the water turns and comes in a powerful stream hitting the windows of the phone booth. closeup melanie recoils from this water attack. through the streaming window she sees the fire volunteers rushing away for cover. to the left we see a horse with its head covered with gulls; its palomino colored body covered with crows. it is bucking and leaping and kicking its van to pieces. at this moment the scene is obliterated by the appearance of a man groping his way closely past the phone booth windows. his face is poring with blood: his head and shoulders are covered with attacking birds. he disappears from sight. melanie, now almost in a faint, opens her eyes to see tides town. through the booth window she sees mitch and deke carter, the owner of the tides, coming down toward the camera and waving the birds away from them with flailing arms. close shot melanie opens the booth doors and starts out with a cry of recognition, but she has barely stepped out when more gulls crash around the booth causing her to go back. closeup melanie in profile looking out again toward mitch.}
