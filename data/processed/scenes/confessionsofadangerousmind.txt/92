<L>__{interior booth (dating game show) day}
<A>__{the director calls the shots. barris stands in the back watching the show in progress. on the stage is a pretty blonde bachelorette in a short black dress and three bachelors. bachelors two and three are attractive and stylishly dressed and groomed. bachelor one is a fat, not too bright looking guy in a yellow ochre leisure suit. his slow, unfocused delivery contrasts with the fast, sharp chatter in the booth.}
