<L>__{interior hospital traction ward day}
<A>__{four men from a jeep accident are lying in traction, their casted limbs roped in the air. evelyn runs in, grabbing a razor blade from the medical cabinet and telling barbara and sandra.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{cut them down, and take cover!! hurry!}
<A>__{bombs are falling outside, on the airfield this wing of the hospital faces. evelyn slices the traction ropes of a man with both legs broken; ignoring his groans, she rolls him out of the bed and covers him with the mattress. the other nurses follow her lead. the bombs are coming toward the hospital ward; evelyn finishes with the fourth man and covers him and herself with the mattress, just as a bomb craters outside the window. the nurses and patients look up after the explosions have passed; there's a chunk of smoking shrapnel lying on the springs of the bunk where the last man had been lying.}
