<B>__{on cloud cover}
<A>__{a dark patch grows behind the clouds. blots out the sunlight. the axiom's keel breaks through. its shadow swallows up the entire landscape. the cockroach senses his master's return. hundreds of red dots rush past him. he eagerly chases after them.}
<B>__{on axiom}
<A>__{the city size starliner lowers gracefully from the sky. pushes back the clouds to the horizon.}
<L>__{exterior opposite side of bay axiom port}
<A>__{the circle of dots triangulate over the abandoned berth. converge over the port's landing shaft. thousands of feet deep. the ship's keel descends into it. the earth shudders. trash towers tumble in the distance. ...then all is quiet.}
<B>__{on belly of the axiom}
<A>__{a row of giant doors open on the side of the ship. multiple gangways automatically extend. connect with built in terminals on the port. the captain walks out gingerly. holding the boot w plant. the other passengers step out on their own legs. wobble like toddlers. they squint up at the harsh sunlight. a commotion is heard from the back. somebody trying to push through.}
<B>__{eve}
<A>__{appears out of the crowd. cradles a boxed up wall e in her arms. m o and the rejects follow behind her. they rush across the gangway. the cockroach meets up with eve. climbs up onto wall e. doesn't understand why his master isn't responding. eve urgently scans the landscape. locks on to wall e's truck in the distance. she takes to the air. m o and the rejects chase after her down the gangway.}

<L>__{interior wall e's truck}
<A>__{the interior is dark and still. suddenly the junk jingles and clinks as the back door opens. eve flies inside with wall e. sets him on the floor. she scans the rotating shelves at high speed. grabs a car jack. ratchets up wall e's crushed body...}
<B>__{quick shots}
<A>__{...spare parts being grabbed by eve... ...frantically installs the new parts into wall e... ...her arms a blur of precision in motion... ...replaces his damaged circuit board. the final piece... ...she opens his new solar panels... ...and blasts a hole in the ceiling with her gun.}

<A>__{she hovers over to the video player. plays hello dolly. looks back to see if it has any effect. wall e is over at the shelves. has scooped all his prized possessions into his compactor. crushes them into a cube. eve is gut punched. wall e motors outside. runs over the cockroach on his way out. the insect pops back to life. watches his friend in shock.}
<L>__{exterior wall e's truck day}

<C>__{eve}
<D>__{wall e...wall e! wall e!}
<A>__{no response. he's gone. she hovers in silence next to him for a long time... finally, eve grasps wall e's hand. forces his fingers to interlace with hers. holds him close one last time. leans her head against his. hums softly.}

<D>__{[hums iotam]}
<A>__{she touches her forehead to his. goodbye wall e. a tiny spark between them. eve turns to hover away. jerked back. her fingers caught between his. she checks his eyes again. nothing. but then... ...a tiny servo noise. she looks down at their hands. close on wall e's fingers they start to move. slowly close around eve's. she looks back at his face. wall e's eyes gradually come into focus. his brows raise...}
