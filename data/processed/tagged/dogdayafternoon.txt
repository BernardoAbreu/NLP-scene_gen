<A>__{long shot down the avenue, 400 mm lens, heat waves shimmering, thousands of old people, and people with children in strollers moving restlessly about in the heat on those endless miles of benches. the shot is on screen only for a beat or two, then gone... sound track comes from a thousand transistor radios, tv sets, auto radios, blended in the open air...}

<A>__{it is parked in a drab brooklyn street. beside the car stands sal, medium height, also good looking in an intense boyish way. his eyes dart about suspiciously, the ever watchful sal. there is a watchful reserve in sal that contrasts to sonny's outgoing bounciness: first impression is sonny is all bark; sal is the bite. sal is dressed in impressive blue suit style, he looks like a kid trying to impress the godfather. he even wears a hat. now, matching sal's preparations inside the car, he checks his tie's alignment, shoots his cuffs and is ready... meanwhile, on their car radio:}

<L>__{interior bank day}
<A>__{a slightly seedy little branch bank, old yellow brick, blond varnished wood, a rubber plant, an american flag. through the windows we see howard, the aged black bank guard, in uniform, taking down the american flag from outside. past him comes sal carrying an attache case. he passes howard coming toward us through the door into the bank. as he passes}

<B>__{on door}

<A>__{as he pulls out the keys, attached to the belt of his uniform. jackie approaches the door of the bank and stops, neither in nor out, as though he can't make up his mind. howard watches him, waiting patiently, keys in hand, folded flag under his arm. close sal still sitting, back to mulvaney, watching jackie's approach and entrance, ready to move on cue.}
<B>__{on door}

<A>__{as he sits, producing as he does a machine pistol, which he holds on mulvaney's chest, out of sight from others in the bank.}
<B>__{mulvaney}

<C>__{mulvaney}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{listen, lemme call you back.}
<A>__{he hangs up, and looks from the gun up to sal's blank hard face. to his own amazement, he grins: a hopeful grin that says: "like me don't hurt me." and he's embarrassed by it. as we watch, his smile turns sour. his pov flash sal's absolutely unmoved face. two shot sonny and jackie jackie moves over to sonny.}

<B>__{sonny}
<A>__{seeing that the bank is closed, locked in, with no customers, crosses toward the front teller's cage area, carrying the florist box. as he reaches the other side, he rips open the box and takes the rifle out and aims it level onto sylvia ball, the teller, who automatically takes the "closed" sign and holds it in front of her face as though to protect herself from the rifle.}

<P>__{(yells)}
<D>__{do what the gentleman says, howard.}
<A>__{sonny sees that howard is useless, so he runs to howard, grabbing the keys from him and pulls howard along with him to the front door. jackie unlocks the door, and jackie, with a last apologetic glance, gives his gun to sonny and vanishes into the sweltering afternoon. sonny then frisks howard and has a sudden afterthought as he locks the door again. he quickly unlocks it and shouts out at jackie.}
<L>__{exterior bank day}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{hey, don't take the car!}
<C>__{jackie}

<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{it's okay... it's okay...}
<A>__{sonny turns into the bank once more, as jackie walks off toward the subway, pointing inside at a desk near the window as he does, to point something out to sonny.}

<A>__{sonny, re entering the bank, speaks to howard.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{lock it.}

<P>__{(taps loudly on top of desk)}
<D>__{hey... get outta there! nobody's gonna hurt you.}
<A>__{jenny, a young, frightened girl, peeks out from under the desk, obviously afraid to reveal herself. sonny starts to move toward the front of the bank. sal turns so he can cover everyone. sonny turns to order howard.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{pull the drapes.}
<A>__{howard doesn't move.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{pulla drapes!}
<A>__{howard belatedly leaps to work, pulling drapes that screen off the interior from outside. the door has no drapes or blinds and thus when the drapes are closed there is a corridor of space across the street we will always be able to see. and from which people outside will always be able to see in. as howard finishes the task, he then walks back to the huddled group on the rear.}
<B>__{sonny}
<A>__{on his way to the back of the bank, is digging into his jacket pocket; he swings around as he passes the camera that is bolted to a wall bracket covering the tellers' area. he whips out a spray can and gives the lens a shot of red painterior there are three cameras in all, each of which he sprays.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{no replay, folks... no alarms...}
<A>__{after spraying the three cameras, he has reached mulvaney's desk area. the girls are scattering to group farther back and sonny and mulvaney are heading for the vault.}

<D>__{we're hip... let's just get you all fixed up and on your way!}
<A>__{miriam, a young, awkward, overweight jewish girl, chewing gum with nervous machine like rapidity, moving toward the vault. the gate is closed, and she holds one key and mulvaney the other. they pass sal, who now holds the others in the bank under his gun while at the vault gate.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{okay, is the vault open?}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{i can take care of that.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{mulvaney is about to insert his key in his lock. sonny quickly reaches out and grabs mulvaney's hand, and looks at the key he has extended. he explodes.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{son of a bitch!}
<A>__{he almost hits mulvaney with his fist.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{what the fuck you tryin' to do? trip the alarm? use the spur key? use the other one...}
<A>__{he's grabbed the keys from mulvaney and holds up the key mulvaney was going to use... we're in a: very tight two shot mulvaney and sonny's heads sonny holds the key right in the middle of the frame where mulvaney and the audience can see the key has a tiny projection or spur at the end. if this key is used, the spur triggers a silent alarm.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{i must of been outta my mind.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{well, you get your mind right. i'm a catholic and i don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me. unnastand?!?}
<A>__{mulvaney nods and picks out a key that is identical except for the spur. he shows it to sonny. sonny nods.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{as mulvaney carefully uses the safe key to unlock the gate. miriam is crying as she unlocks her side. the gate swings open. sonny shoves mulvaney inside and, as he passes miriam, notices her tears. she just stands there staring into his face like a hypnotized chicken, the tears streaming down her face. sonny stops, staring at her. mulvaney, starting to open the gate, moves inside the vault, impatient...}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{okay. let's get you on your way. miriam open the safe.}
<A>__{miriam hesitates.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{what's the matter with you?}

<A>__{sonny storms into the vault.}
<B>__{new angle in vault}
<A>__{as mulvaney pulls a cash drawer out to show sonny: even we can see there isn't much there. sonny searches for more, finds nothing.}

<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{it's all we got.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{okay, don't worry about it. stick it in the bag...}
<A>__{at this, sonny pulls out a plastic bag from his pocket, hands it to miriam, who opens it and puts the money into it. as he turns, we see that miriam is still staring at him, terrified, and as his rifle swings around, she reels back with a little screech of terror...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{ah, jesus...}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{let's go, sonny.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(suddenly gentle)}

<D>__{what the hell would i shoot her for?}
<A>__{miriam follows sonny to teller's cages gate. he carries the bag. phone starts to ring (#1)}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{answer the phone!}
<A>__{mulvaney crosses to his desk, picks up the receiver. sal follows him, yanks receiver from one ear to the other, so he can hear conversation.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(to miriam)}
<D>__{okay... open this.}
<A>__{miriam crosses to gate, presses the necessary button and the gate opens from them. sonny watches this carefully, noting where the buzzer button is. he crosses in front of the drawer at the first cage. he tries to open the drawer. it's obviously locked.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{okay, who's the head teller here?}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{open this up!}
<A>__{sylvia comes forward and unlocks the first drawer, and begins to remove the cash, but sonny grabs her hands... alarmed...}

<D>__{don't take it all out!}
<A>__{he grabs a piece of paper or cardboard... close shot sonny's hands and cash in drawer he takes all the singles but one out of the singles slot in the drawer, leaving the bottom single in place. it is held there by a metal clip. he carefully slips the paper under the clip and then removes the single. it is clear this is an automatic alarm meanwhile...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{boy, i can't trust a one of you... i worked in a bank, i know the alarms, so don't try to fool around with me!}
<B>__{back to shot of sonny and sylvia and miriam}
<A>__{as they move to 2nd cash drawer at 2nd teller's cage. sylvia unlocks the drawer and starts to reach in for the cash, but sonny pushes his hand into the drawer instead. he begins to stuff the money into the bag. some fives, packaged with rubber bands, in the drawer, he holds up so sal and all can see them... he laughs!}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{decoy money, right, it's marked! shit!}
<A>__{he throws it into the air so the bills flutter all around him, gaily... in the background, mulvaney, having finished with the phone conversation, is moving to the rear with the rest of the girls. sonny now moves to the 3rd cage's cash drawer... mulvaney ends phone conversation and sal moves him over to group at vault.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(mimicking sylvia)}
<D>__{'this window is shut...'}

<A>__{as he moves toward the rear (sylvia and miriam now re joining other women), to get a wastebasket. accomplishing this, he starts to burn the pages of the register, tearing out pages as he does so. it's smokey as hell, but not burning well. he drops it, smoking, into the wastebasket.}

<D>__{they'll shoot you; the fucking cops'll shoot you... they don't give a damn. in spite of that bank insurance. you see what they did in attica, they shot everybody, the hostages, prisoners, cops, guards, forty two people they killed, the innocent with the guilty.}
<A>__{they have the machine almost to the door now, with mulvaney almost pinned between the machine and the door. he eases himself out. looks at the gun, then at sonny, then they shove the machine against the door. sonny then gives mulvaney his jacket to put on again.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{anyway, i'm not gonna take you. i'm gonna take one of the girls, a married one with a couple of kids. the cops don't like it in the papers when they kill a mother, especially if she's got young kids.}

<L>__{exterior bank day}
<A>__{the frame is full of cop faces... tough, mesomorphic faces with a layer of fat under the skin, increasing as age. they have the look of cops: alert, curious, weighing. they are city cops; they don't have that old fashioned condemnatory expression, there is an element of playfulness in their nature the fact is they love their work, which is criminals. there is a peculiar delight in ferreting out the criminal impulse in everybody, and a matching fury in punishing it which is the action of repressing their own strongly developed criminal unconscious. these are tense, funny, violent, and rigidly controlled men. moretti is an old line cop, a lot more relaxed than the younger men and the cold professionals of the fbi, who as a group resemble astronauts, and like them hide (but do not deny) the psychic chaos underneath. right now they are looking at the sky. we hear a heavy helicopter track. we feature sheldon, the silver haired fbi agent in charge, who looks like an accountant, and moretti, with hat and cigar, and a face out of warner brothers movies of the forties. in spite of sheldon's age, moretti plays though he's a smart kid who still needs a little help. sheldon is getting out of a gray car, wears a gray suit. three men with him are carbon copies of him at younger ages. the three hang around him. they approach moretti who looks at them without moving.}

<A>__{a cop passing by presses a portable two way radio into moretti's hand: he accepts it and holds as though he expected it. the cop passes the same type of set to certain other officers. these sets are tuned in to each other, and throughout the movie, there is a constant background talk on these sets. this is police procedure; the orders are for everyone to talk about everything. if anyone has a question, has heard a rumor or a sound, whatever, it is immediately responded to, so that there can be the fewest possible surprises. sample dialogue might go: "did i hear a shot?" "over here, by the bank, there was a report like a gunshot, inside." "roger, we heard that from the barbershop... it was inside the bank." "barbershop, you can see inside?" "roger, we heard from the barbershop... it was inside the bank." "barbershop, you can see inside?" "roger, this is the barbershop, we see inside, the perpetrator is moving toward the rear of the bank." "who's that guy walking through the barricade?" "the blue suit?" "yeah." "off duty inspector come down to see can you use him." etc. they really do use the word perpetrator, felon, etc. the cop handing out radios makes moretti sign for it which moretti does during the following:}

<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{call me whatever you want.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{okay, sonny, i want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what i want to do is work out a way to get them out of there. i want to come over there, without a gun... and you can frisk me. so you can see you can trust me. so we can talk and find a way outta this mess.}

<B>__{their reactions}
<A>__{they stare at him; they've already begun to forget him: the moment in the bank when they said their goodbyes is already receding from their consciousness. their smiles are forced, and they don't really know what to say.}
