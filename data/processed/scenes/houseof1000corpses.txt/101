<L>__{interior farmhouse kitchen late afternoon}
<A>__{dirty dishes overflow from the rusty metal sink onto the surrounding counters. a large cat walks across piles of food left to rot on a table. boxes of trash and old newspapers are stacked to the ceiling. music from a crackling radio is heard. mother stands stirring a large pot on the stove. a loud knocking interrupts her cooking. she sets down her spoon and walks to the front door. before opening the door she peeks through the curtains of a small side window. she sees wydell and runs from the kitchen.}
