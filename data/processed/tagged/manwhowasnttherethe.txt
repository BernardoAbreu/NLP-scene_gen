<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...i stumbled into it well, married into it more precisely...}

<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...the dump was 200 feet square, with five chairs, or stations as we call 'em, even though there were only two of us working...}
<A>__{we track in on a big man in a barber's smock scissoring across a lock of hair that he pulls taut between two fingers of one hand. in slow motion, he laughs and chats.}

<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...now maybe if you're eleven or twelve years old, frank's got an interesting point of view, but sometimes it got on my nerves. not that i'd complain, mind you. like i said, he was the principal barber. frank's father august they called him guzzi had worked the heads up in santa rosa for thirty five years until his ticker stopped in the middle of a junior flat top. he left the shop to frankie free and clear. and that seemed to satisfy all of frank's ambitions: cutting the hair and chewing the fat. me, i don't talk much...}

<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...i just cut the hair...}

<C>__{ed }
<D>__{now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. for the kids there's the butch, or the heinie...}
<A>__{we cut to examples of the haircuts as they are ticked off:}
<C>__{ed }

<D>__{...yeah... i guess doris liked all that he man stuff. sometimes i had the feeling that she and big dave were a lot closer than they let on...}
<A>__{he turns and looks through the screen door into the house. across the dim living room we can see a sliver of the brightly lit kitchen. big dave, wearing a frilly apron, stands at the counter drying dishes. his broad back heaves with laughter while doris, just hidden by the wall, chats away, handing dishes across.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...the signs were all there plain enough not that i was gonna prance about it, mind you. it's a free country.}
<A>__{footsteps approach the front porch. with the squeak of the screen door, big dave emerges.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{holding down the porch area?}
<A>__{ed gives a half grin of wry acknowledgement. big dave relaxes, forearms against the porch railing, gazing out at the front lawn.}

<D>__{couldn't be better. these're boom times in retailing. we're opening another store, big dave's annex, there on garson. this is strictly haberdashery casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. matter of fact, i'm thinking of making doris the comptroller. how're things at the, uh, the barbershop?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{all right, i guess.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...fine. fine. well, you might want to drop by the annex when we open, update your suit 'course, you're in the smock all day.}

<C>__{ed}
<D>__{specialty store down in sacramento.}

<D>__{doris wasn't big on divine worship...}
<A>__{doris is concentrating on the six cards spread in front of her.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...and i doubt if she believed in life everlasting; she'd most likely tell you that our reward is on this earth and bingo is probably the extent of it...}
<A>__{still focused on her cards, doris mutters to ed:}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{watch your card, honey.}
<C>__{caller}
<D>__{i... sixteen...}
<A>__{ed continues to gaze off at the window, smoke pluming from his cigarette.}

<C>__{doris}
<D>__{jesus, bingo bingo!}
<B>__{barbershop}
<A>__{sun slants in through the big window at the end of the day. ed sweeps hair trimmings, looking intently down at the floor, a cigarette dangling from his lip. frank sits on one of the vinyl waiting chairs, talking at ed's back.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{...so you tie your own flies, ed. i mean, if you're really serious. you tie your own flies, you do a i know it's matickless, i know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store but you can buy your fish at the store, ed, you see what i'm saying?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{the point is there's a certain art to the process. the point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{sportsmanship! that's my pointerior june fly, ed? mosquito? which of these? well, what fish do you seek?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{sure, go to the store. go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn fish, ed...}
<A>__{we see a black suited figure approaching through the windows at the far end of the shop. he is almost blown out by the late day sunlight hitting the window.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{...my point is, this is a man who knows nothing no matter how much you tell him, so sell him the goddamn fish, ed.}
<A>__{the bell over the front door tinkles, and the swarthy middle aged man walks in. he is well dressed perhaps a little too snazzily for this small town and has a sporty pencil mustache.}

<D>__{ok, boys, which of you gets the privilege?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we're just closing, friend.}

<C>__{stranger}
<D>__{oh, those fiery mediterraneans. say! not so fast there, brother }
<A>__{ed has switched on the clippers, but the stranger waves him back; he lifts off a toupee.}
<C>__{stranger}
<D>__{...pretty good, huh? fools even the experts. 100 percent human hair, handcrafted by jacques of san francisco, and i'd hate to have to tell you what i paid for it.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{stranger}
<D>__{yes, it's a nice rug. i'm paying for it down on the installment plan...}
<A>__{ed starts to trim the stranger's fringe.}
<C>__{stranger}
<D>__{...a lot of folks live with the pate exposed. they say the dames think it's sexy. but for my money it's just not good grooming and grooming, my friend, is probably the most important thing in business after personality, of course...}
<A>__{he twists around to offer his hand.}
<C>__{stranger}
<D>__{...creighton tolliver, pleased to know ya.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{ed crane. what brings you to santa rosa?}

<C>__{ed}
<D>__{uh }
<C>__{creighton}
<D>__{well, it's the wildest goose there is. risk money. very speculative. except, ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? i thought i had a prospect here. well, i make the haul up and this lousy so and so tells me his situation has changed all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. thank you, mother! pop goes another bubble! it's only the biggest business opportunity since henry ford and i can't seem to interest a soul!}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{that right.}
<C>__{creighton}
<D>__{it's called dry cleaning. you heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning' wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. it's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. and here's the capper: no shrinkage.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{huh.}
<C>__{creighton}
<D>__{that's right! dry cleaning remember the name. it's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away. all i need is $10,000 to open my first store, then i use its cash flow to finance another, and so on leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. well, me and a partner. cleanliness, friend. there's money in it. there's a future. there's room to grow... say, that's looking pretty good. let's see it with the hairpiece on...}
<B>__{bathroom doorway}

<A>__{the reverse show doris soaking in the tub, reading a magazine.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...was i crazy to be thinking about it? was he a huckster, or opportunity, the real mccoy?}
<A>__{ed takes the cigarette from his mouth, exhales.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...my first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. but maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. what if i could get the money?}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{honey?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{mm.}
<A>__{she lifts one leg and rests the heel on the rim of the tub.}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{shave my legs, will ya?}
<A>__{ed saunters over, perches on the tub and puts the cigarette back in his mouth to free his hands. he picks up a bar of soap and starts soaping the leg. he sets down the soap and picks up a safety razor. the razor takes long slow strokes along the lather, dark bits of hair flecking the white foam.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...it was clean. no water. chemicals.}
<A>__{he shakes the razor in the tub. shavings float away across the soap slicked water.}
<C>__{doris}
<P>__{(absently, as she reads)}
<D>__{gimme a drag.}
<A>__{ed pulls the cigarette from his mouth between two fingers, uses the two fingers to flip it over, and holds it for doris as she sucks. he brings the cigarette, now marked with lipstick, back to his own mouth. she murmurs:}

<B>__{a door}
<A>__{we hear a voice, muffled through the door, breaking into laughter. a hand enters to knock.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{yeah, come in.}
<A>__{the door swings open to show creighton in his shirtsleeves sitting on the bed, talking on the phone. a tray of room service dishes sits near him. he is bald; his hairpiece sits on the pillow next to him.}
<C>__{creighton}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{ok... yeah. i will see you tomorrow.}
<A>__{he hangs up, looks quizzically at ed.}
<C>__{creighton}
<D>__{...oh, i thought you were the porter... can i help you?}
<A>__{ed stands awkwardly by the door.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{...i'm, uh, ed.}

<C>__{ed}
<D>__{...ed crane. remember? today?}
<C>__{creighton}
<D>__{sorry, friend, i, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.}
<C>__{ed}

<C>__{ed}
<D>__{no. i might be interested in that, uh, business proposition }

<C>__{ed}
<D>__{what's involved, aside from putting up the money? what're you looking for the partner to do?}
<C>__{creighton}
<D>__{do? hell, nothing. well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but i'm looking for a silent partner. i've done the research, i've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. i'm just looking for venture capital, friend. disappear if you want, check in whenever you like i want the dough; i don't take attendance.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{and how do we share }
<C>__{creighton}
<D>__{fifty fifty, straight down the line. you and me. finance and expertise. so you've got the dough then, do ya?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i will have it in a week.}
<C>__{creighton}
<D>__{well, i will be damned. the barber! and i thought this trip was a bust. well...}

<C>__{ed}
<D>__{ed.}
<A>__{they both knock back the whiskey. creighton leans back and gives ed a heavy lidded stare, a faint smile on his lips, his hairpiece slightly askew. ed stares back. after a beat, without taking his eyes of ed, creighton reaches up and loosens his tie. an almost imperceptible wink. ed stares.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{...was that a pass?}
<C>__{creighton}
<P>__{(hoarsely)}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{ed}

<C>__{riedenschneider}
<D>__{...you've gotta give me something to work with. freddy riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. he can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. look. look at what the other side is gonna run at us. they got the company books, prepared by you cooked by you that's motive. they got a murder scene you had access to. that's opportunity. they got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with a dame's weapon }

<D>__{it was big dave's.}
<C>__{riedenschneider}

<A>__{his pacing becomes more animated.}
<C>__{riedenschneider}
<D>__{...and it makes him the bad guy ya dig around, ya never know, something unsavory from his past, he approaches you to help with the money, it's too late, his past comes back to haunt him, who's to say...}

<A>__{ed smiles thinly.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{anyway, uh... my point is you're young. a kid really, your whole life ahead of you. but it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. before it all washes away.}

<D>__{well, sure, i guess. pop says so too. i work pretty hard at school.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{that's swell. however, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from mrs swan, they'll only take you so far. there's this guy in san francisco, i've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. his name is jacques carcanogues. i'm not sure i'm pronouncing it right. anyway, he's a frenchman.}
