<L>__{interior cathedral a moment later night}
<A>__{ancient and creepy. a huge pipe organ, shattered stained glass windows, row after row of mahogany pews... all forgotten, covered with dust and cobwebs. the joker wanders about, staring at the statuary, the rusted icons. dick enters silently behind him. he kneels behind a rear pew, brings up the gun, and squeezes off three quick shots at the joker. the joker dives, takes cover, and returns dick's fire. then: silence. in a crouch, groping his way along the wall, the joker finds what he wants: a small door opening on a wooden stairway, leading to the belltower. he ducks inside and starts up. dick's gun drops with a thud. his hand slips from the back of the pew. in the second before he slumps to the floor, unconscious, he sees a curious sight: a tiny black ninja wheel, imbedded in the flesh of his leg. behind him framed in the arched doorway a ragged black ghost begins his final unholy march down the center aisle of the old cathedral.}

<A>__{batman. broken, beaten, his right leg useless, he hauls himself up the steps one at a time. he should be dead. dried blood cakes his face, his chest. dizzy, exhausted, his body strained to the limit, he slumps against a wall to steady himself, then reaches into his utility belt for a painkiller and forces the capsule back onto his dry, swollen tongue. quaking all over, he tries to draw himself erect... and topples over, landing with his full weight on the rotten wood of the belltower stairs. the stairway collapses, turning to splinters beneath him. and suddenly batman finds himself dangling precariously in midair, hanging by one hand to an upper step. it would be so much easier to let go. he looks down at the fragments of the shattered stairway, still falling, vanishing into the dark depths of the stairwell. then he looks up. at the trapdoor. a mere six feet away. his teeth clench in a monstrous grimace. and with an inhuman effort, he hoists himself up onto the upper steps. for a full five seconds he's blind with pain. a ragged wooden shaft is buried in his right shoulder. twitching, trembling, he reaches up and yanks it out with his last ounce of strength. the trapdoor is a foot above his head. it could be a mile. batman finally realizes he's not going to make it. he reaches down and rips open a velcro seal on his utility belt, revealing the strange timer device we saw him making earlier. before he can activate it his hand falls limply at his side. the batman is out like a light.}
<L>__{interior belltower that moment night}
<A>__{the joker glances casually down at the trapdoor, wondering what all the noise is about. he draws his gun, moves cautiously to the trapdoor, and lifts it a few inches... just enough to see the unconscious form on the stairs.}
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{... batman?}
<A>__{no reply. the joker stands there and lets out a little snicker. he looks out through the archway, sees no sign of his rescue copter. then a look of curious amusement on his face he steps down through the trapdoor and lugs batman up into the belltower. he props batman up against a wall. still no sign of life. the joker crouches beside him and almost tenderly pats his face.}

<A>__{batman emits a tiny low moan. the joker takes it as a yes and reaches over to undo his cowl. bruce wayne stares up with dulled, sightless eyes. the joker reaches into his pocket for a purple handkerchief, moistens it, dabs at the caked blood on bruce's face.}

<A>__{a spotlight cuts through the night sky. the joker hears his helicopter approaching in the distance. bruce reaches down furtively. finds the timer on his utility belt. flicks a switch... and the countdown begins. the joker pulls a straight razor from his pocket and opens it gingerly.}

<D>__{i have to do it now, bruce, but it won't even hurt. now relax. the bat's in his belfry, all's right with the world...}

<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{no... sense... of humor?}
<A>__{the joker reaches out for the ticking time bomb. thinks better of it and retracts his shaking hand. he can see the copter approaching now, slicing through the clouds. he screams, waves a flashlight in the air: his signal beacon. 0:20 and counting. the joker scans the belltower frantically. his eyes fall on the trapdoor. he races over, flings it open, starts down the stairs in a frenzy. there are no stairs. they've collapsed. 0:16 and counting. screaming insanely, the joker vaults through the door and makes for the open stone archway. the copter is directly overhead now. a rope ladder drops from its belly.}

<L>__{interior belltower}
<A>__{the joker leaps into empty space, grabs hold of the ladder, cackles in mad triumph and suddenly the belltower is full of bats. a screeching swarm, hideous, black winged swooping through the archways directly at the joker who screams in terror lets go of the ladder and plunges into the night. tight on batman. six seconds remain. there is still time if he makes his choice now. surrounded by the flapping of leathery wings, his body working on pure adrenalin, he unbuckles the belt. lurches into position. heaves it out into the darkness. it snags on the bottom rung of the dangling rope ladder.}

<B>__{pov joker}
<A>__{looking up he sees a beautiful display of fireworks, bursting and burning, spirals of color snaking through the sky as the helicopter explodes in eerie silence. reverse angle the joker's face it's all so lovely. the joker's expression is happy, almost childlike, as he gazes up at this private show. gradually, though, the bright colors fade; and the joker's face begins to relax, the twisted grin dissolving at last as darkness sets in.}
