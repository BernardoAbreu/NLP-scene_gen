<A>__{chris checks ridley. no pulse. his own rustling movements prevent him from hearing... that soft crackling sound. the kitchen is lined with fifty year old ivy patterned wallpaper. the printed vines seem to be moving! chris doesn't notice until the vines begin to wiggle furiously... and rip through the paper. they're real. sprouts from some sort of exotic plant, that have climbed up the walls... with intelligence! they seem aware of chris' presence.}

<D>__{ridley?}
<A>__{rebecca has appeared in an open doorway. chris looks at her, with the tips of the vines beginning to brush his shoulders.}
<C>__{rebecca }
<D>__{who... who are...}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i... i'm one of the good guys, okay i'm just trying to...}

<C>__{chris}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{chris, familiar with the room, opens a small door in the wall, barely man sized, and almost invisible because it's covered in matching wallpaper. chris dives in. aiken and sullivan pop up behind rebecca, having barely caught a glimpse of chris.}
<C>__{aiken}
<D>__{who was that?}
<C>__{sullivan}
<D>__{forget him. what are they?}
<A>__{sullivan points at the vines... which are swirling, groping, as if alive, making their way toward ridley's body.}
