<L>__{interior boston streets continuous}
<A>__{through alleys, down streets, under an overpass, down a one way street, barely missing a head on as they roar into a rail yard traversing the waterfront. brill's at his best, putting distance between himself and the cops at every turn. finally, it looks as if they've made it as they race down an alleyway, only to realize it's a dead end. brill slams into reverse. they screech backward, tires smoking. too late. the squad car rips into the alleyway, boxing them in. brill hits the brakes. he looks back at the dead end and sees an empty flat bed trailer with a ramp. brill gives it everything. if they can get enough speed and hit the ramp right, maybe they can clear the obstructing wall.}
<C>__{brill}
<D>__{feeling lucky?}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{not particularly, no.}
<A>__{they hit the ramp full speed. the front end bottoms at the taurus bounces skyward. tires clip the wall as the car flips and smashes into a parked rail car filled with coal. they aren't going anywhere. back in the alley, the squad car skids to a stop. a rookie climbs from his car, leaps the wall, draws his gun and nears... inside the taurus, the windows are shattered. steam hisses, gasoline drips and coal is everywhere. dean shimmies out through a broken side window. he barely gets to his feet as he stumbles 20 yards or so. his foot accidentally dislodges a large pile of coal, which buries him up to his waist and immobilizes him.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{shit.}
<P>__{(to brill)}
<D>__{i'm stuck. help me out.}
<A>__{he looks back to see that brill is hanging out the driver's side, bleeding badly and covered in gas.}

<P>__{(on waist radio)}
<D>__{one lincoln nine, suspects ta'd into a coal car at the fullbright rail yards. requesting back up, fire and ambulance.}

<D>__{two murder suspects. one's wounded, the other's maybe dead.}

<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(to krug)}
<D>__{check inside.}
<A>__{dean is watching this all unseen, helplessly trying to dig himself out of the coal. krug inspects the taurus interior for anything of interest. jones scans the area.}
<C>__{krug}
<P>__{(to brill as he searches.)}
<D>__{i hate doin' cops, i really do. you i won't mind. didn't mind that rachel banks. didn't mind doin' her one bit.}
<P>__{(seeing dean's shoe)}
<D>__{your lawyer friend buried over there?}
<A>__{brill can only gurgle blood. jones pops the taurus's trunk had looks inside. krug digs quickly through the coal pile, searching for dean. then brill sees him brill's pov: dean down off the side of the coal car, lodged in the coal pile. he's safe, but not once krug discovers he's not in the car. brill pushes in the cigarette lighter. jones dumps everything from the taurus into the unmarked car. sirens suddenly fade in. krug digs faster, looking for dean, as jones approaches with his pistol, clambering around for brill.}
<C>__{krug}
<D>__{fuck him, he's dead in two minutes. find dean.}
<A>__{jones starts to back out, just as the taurus's cigarette lighter pops out. brill grabs it. krug eyes the glowing lighter. then he eyes brill. shit. brill ignites the gas. wa woomff!! a fireball explodes, consuming all the car, brill, krug. jones is blown off his feet from the concussion.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(scrambling away)}
<D>__{fuck }
<A>__{jones wipes prints off his pistol and silencer and tosses it into the flames as the police cars approach. dean watches from the shadows as flames incinerate everything.}
