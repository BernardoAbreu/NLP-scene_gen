<L>__{interior secret passages night}
<A>__{aramis silently leads the others through the secret passage, to the portal into the king's bedroom.}
<L>__{interior king's bedchamber night}
<A>__{the king is lying on the bed; we see him from the pov of someone approaching him slowly, silently. when his eyes open in panic, it is too late... we see aramis, athos, porthos from the king's pov as they swarm him.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{it is judgment day.}
<A>__{his fist drops into frame... louis loses consciousness. louis' pov as consciousness returns. he see phillippe in louis' clothes. aramis, athos and porthos bow and say...}
<C>__{musketeers}
<D>__{your majesty.}
<A>__{louis, still on his bed, now wears phillippe's clothes.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{wh wha }
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{don't look so shocked, phillippe. come, you're going back to prison.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{phillippe?! why do you call me }
<A>__{now louis understands everything. he tries to struggle, but instantly porthos shoves a rag into his mouth. aramis opens the main door a crack, and sees d'artagnan has entered his room down the corridor, through whose open door he can guard the approaches to the king's rooms. aramis shuts the door again and turns to the others.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{d'artagnan guards the hallway! you must go back the way we came!}
<A>__{athos puts his hands on phillippe's shoulders.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{now, your majesty. it is time.}
<A>__{aramis and porthos bow again to phillippe now dressed and looking exactly like the king. phillippe's mouth is dry; he swallows hard, and follows athos up the hidden stairs.}
