<L>__{interior tea room night}
<A>__{a wild thrasher club. an incredible thrash band is on stage cranking. kids jump wildly into the moshing pit. ace enters, sees a burnout at the bar whose head is circling insanely to the music.}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{excuse me?! is greg here?!}
<A>__{the burnout's head thrashes on. no acknowledgement of ace.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{thank you!}
<A>__{ace heads for the basement stairs.}
<L>__{interior basement stairs night}
<A>__{ace descends the stairs, stopping at a large steel door. ace bangs on it three times. a voice is heard from inside.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{password!}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{tom vu! i pay for sex! you can too!}
<A>__{click! the door electronically unlatches and slides open.}
<L>__{interior basement night}
<A>__{ace enters. green peace "save the whales" posters abound. greg woodstock, a laid back, ex hippy with long gray hair, sits at a very impressive computer set up. ace and he have their own distinct banter. a thud from above. ace looks up. ace's pov part of the ceiling is made of metal grating, so you can see the bottom of the dance floor. a guy's face gets smashed into the grate. we see that it is the burnout from the club.}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(to burnout)}

<D>__{i certainly do.}
<B>__{on the screen}
<A>__{a map with several ships on the ocean. he quickly taps in some commands and the ships start sailing in all different directions.}
<C>__{woodstock}
