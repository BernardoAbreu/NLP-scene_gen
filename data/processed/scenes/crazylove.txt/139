<C>__{l}
<C>__{letty}

<C>__{michael}
<D>__{like i've told you before i don't want you taking care of me.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{someone has to take care of you right now, michael. you tore up the apartment. you stopped taking your medications.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{but that wasn't me. i didn't mean to do that.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{well then why'd it happen?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i don't know. i don't fucking know.}
<A>__{letty and michael glare at each other. letty looks away.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i didn't come here to blame you.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i didn't mean for any of this to happen.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{oh, god, michael, i know.}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{why does everything have to be so hard?}
<A>__{michael shakes his head.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{what are we going to do?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{what do you want to do?}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i know i don't want to lose you. i don't think i could stand it.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yeah, but can you stand to be with me like this?}
<A>__{letty waits. she looks away. she turns back and stares into michael's eyes. finally, she says it.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{no. i can't, michael. i'm so sorry, but i just can't handle all this right now.}
<A>__{letty starts to cry. tears well up in michael's eyes.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i know. i can't either.}
<A>__{michael sits down on the bed and they hold each other.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i love you so much.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i love you too, letty. i love you, too.}
<A>__{letty and michael grip each other. finally, they pull apart.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{maybe we could just run away to tahiti and live on the beach.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{that's the best idea i've heard in a long time.}
<A>__{letty wipes a tear from michael's cheek.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{how about something better? like a kiss.}
<B>__{t}
<A>__{he couple kisses more tenderly than ever before.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i can still come visit you, you know.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{would that really be such a good idea for either of us?}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{just promise me you'll be ok. ok.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i will. and you make sure you take care of yourself.}
<A>__{michael puts his hand under letty's chin and draws her head up so he can look into her eyes.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{promise you won't fall for any guys pretending to be doctors.}
<A>__{letty shakes her head "no" as tears stream down her face.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i guess i should go now.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you should go.}
<A>__{letty stands up and walks toward the door. she comes back and embraces michael again. slowly, they separate, and letty leaves the room. michael stares out the window.}
