<D>__{jesus christ.}
<B>__{their pov}
<A>__{tire treads lead across the manicured front lawn to where a little red sports car rests with its hood crumpled into a palm trunk.}
<B>__{tracking down the great hallway}
<A>__{through the french doors at its far end we can see bunny, naked, briefly bouncing on the diving board before splashing into the illuminated pool outside. heavy metal music filters in from a boom box by the pool. brandt, approaching, stoops and straightens, stoops and straightens, picking up the discarded clothes that run the length of the hall.}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{he can't see you, dude.}
<A>__{we pull the dude and walter as they approach the doors to the great study. walter's dog follows, stiffly waving its tail.}

<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{you shouldn't go in there, dude! he's very angry!}
<A>__{bang the dude and walter push through the double doors into }
<B>__{the great room}
<A>__{the big lebowski turns at the sound of the door. his wheelchair hums as he spins it around.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{well, she's back. no thanks to you.}

<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{well, you have your story, i have mine. i say i entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{as if we would ever dream of taking your bullshit money!}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{you thought bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear. all you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me. you thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{well? aren't you?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{well. . . yeah.}
<C>__{lebowski}

<C>__{walter}
<D>__{let me tell you something else. i've seen a lot of spinals, dude, and this guy is a fake. a fucking goldbricker.}
<A>__{he is crossing to lebowski.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{this guy fucking walks. i've never been more certain of anything in my life!}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{stay away from me, mister!}
<A>__{walter reaches around from behind and hoists the big lebowski out of the wheelchair by his armpits.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{walk, you fucking phony!}
<A>__{the big lebowski waggles helplessly, his rubbery feet grazing the floor like a raggedy ann's. the pomeranian gaily leaps and yaps.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{put me down, you son of a bitch!}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{walter!}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{it's all over, man! we call your fucking bluff!}

<A>__{he shoves the big lebowski forward and he crumples to the floor, weeping.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{oh, shit.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<P>__{(sobbing)}
<D>__{you're bullies! cowards, both of you!}
<A>__{walter is abashed. the big lebowski flails about on the floor.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{oh, shit.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{he can't walk, walter!}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{yeah, i can see that, dude.}
