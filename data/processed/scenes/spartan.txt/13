<D>__{you know where she is...he's holding up...}
<P>__{(as an afterthought)}
<D>__{he was in town yesterday. to see her.}
<C>__{scott}
<P>__{(as he shakes his head to clear it)}
<D>__{he was?}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{...we snuck him in, and out.}
<A>__{we see miller, in the bg, in a hurried conference, nod at scott.}
<C>__{miller}

<C>__{aide}
<D>__{...the coast guard has a watch over this area:}
<P>__{(he points to the chart)}
<D>__{and they have scheduled the colophon first...}
<A>__{scott and the agent stop in front of the interrogation room, where we see the agent, gaines, a guard over him. gaines is sitting, looking as if he had been weeping. the guard addresses scott and the other agent.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{he copped to it.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{he copped to what?}
<C>__{guard}
<P>__{(of gaines)}
<D>__{off post punched out early to go boffing his girlfriend.}
<A>__{scott shakes his head as if to say "how about that..." the agent holds a photo of a very lovely eurasian woman in a business suit, and shows it to scott.}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{hope she was worth it...}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<A>__{scott stands wearily, watching several large men berating the seated secret service agent. an agent appears with a tearsheet showing the ad for "the regency club". we see the ad for exotic young companions, and the address is boston. scott gives instructions to the aide. angle interior washroom. scott, having stripped off his shirt, is washing himself at the sink. the "regency" ad, and a description of the club is pasted with water to the mirror before him. we read, in the mirror: "regency. 243 charles street, boston, mass. owners of record..." et cetera. in the mirror we see the aide bring a fresh shirt and a tie to scott. scott turns, as the door swings, and he sees, in the bg, anton, just entering the establishment. angle interior the boathouse. a swat team is laying out its weapons and assault gear, on a long table. hold on anton, who is standing, unassigned, and looking it. we see, on an improvised bulletin board, photos of the boy, blake, the professor, and the girl, blown up from a newspaper shot, and in various photos. as we watch an agent walks up with a box full of photos, and tacks one up on the board. it is an altered shot showing the young girl with short, spikey platinum hair. angle on scott, dressed in a clean shirt, a tie, as he takes a photo from the box. we see him put it next to the original, blonde photo, and look at both.}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{we ran it up from a description of the colorist from the beauty parlor...}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{gimme your coat.}
<A>__{the agent takes off his suitcoat, and gives it to scott, who puts it on. angle, on scott, as he holds the photos, and the regency description. he walks toward the door, through the mass of agents. he stops by miller, who is on the phone, looking at a photograph of the professor, as a tech hooks up a video feed of a house on the water, the professor's house. a photo of a sailboat is tacked up. we read 'the colophon' on its stern.}
<C>__{scott}
<P>__{(to miller)}
<D>__{i need five thousand dollars.}
<A>__{miller gestures "just a moment", and then waves to an aide, meaning "do it".}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{how long do we have? sir?}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{it hits the papers, and we're done.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{no...note? no...}
<A>__{miller shakes his head, he holds up the "regency" note...}
<C>__{scott}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{i've got it...}
<P>__{(to miller)}
<D>__{can i have some backup?}
<A>__{miller, gesturing around the room, meaning "what you see is what you get". all the occupants of the room are engaged on some task, save anton, who sits alone on a bench. scott looks at anton, who glances at scott, trying to keep the appeal out of his glance, "please take me".}
<C>__{scott}
<P>__{(to anton)}
<D>__{we're scraping the bottom of the barrel here, aren't we?}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{yes. sir.}
<A>__{scott looks at anton and shakes his head. he is summoned to the front of the room by a young woman, who is putting cash into an envelope. scott comes over to her, and we see her filling out a slip of paper. she hands him the cash in the envelope, and the slip of paper.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{i need you to sign it.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{you sign it.}
<P>__{(he scans the room}
<D>__{again, shrugs, and}
<P>__{motions to anton)}
<D>__{come on, wallflower...}
<P>__{(anton rises and walks over to him)}
<A>__{scott turns to anton.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{now: your mouth shut. your eyes open, and form on me...here's where we're going...}
<A>__{there is the sound of a gunshot. scott and anton instinctively take cover against the side of the building, drawing their sidearms. hold tight on scott. as he looks through the half open door. we see several of the swat men, taking up positions, one of them kicks open a door, and his partner enters. pause. we hear the partner call "clear". angle, on scott, as he re enters the building, and proceeds, pistol out, toward the room. angle his pov. on the floor, we see the dead secret service agent, a pistol in his hand. we see miller turn to his team. an agent kneels to the fallen secret service agent, and prods a small hideout pistol from his hand. scott turns to leave, and sees anton standing next to him.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{don't look at him. don't look at the downed man. he's dead...}
<P>__{(as he turns his back on the scene)}
<D>__{kick the fool overboard...}
<A>__{angle on anton and scott as they leave. in the bg we see miller et al. miller giving directions.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{...who is the girl he went to see? get her in...the girl he was fucking...who's got the coastguard...}
<A>__{tight on anton and scott as they exit the building.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{i'd hate to be the lucky duck who frisked him...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{he was off post when they snatched the girl?}
<C>__{scott}
<P>__{(as he looks at the fallen agent)}
<D>__{yeah. well, apparently, he felt bad about it...}
