<L>__{interior therapist's office day}
<A>__{the dialogue begins in voice over as the title card fades. we slowly fade in to see seymour, lying on a pink pastel psychiatrist's couch, as he speaks to his therapist, a handsome, well coiffed woman in her late 40s.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{so tell me more about this job. what exactly will you be doing?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their cd reissues. it's really... i can't believe it.}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{remember what i said when we first started this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{it doesn't pay very much, but i should be able to afford my own place in a few months... do you think that's too soon? i'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{why don't we start with that next week?}
<A>__{seymour looks up. she nods toward the large wall clock behind her: thirty seconds after five. re gets up and she walks him slowly toward the door.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{thank you, doctor.}
<C>__{therapist}
<P>__{(as she opens the door)}
<D>__{don't thank me. you're doing all the work.}
<A>__{a pause. they stand facing each other.}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{seymour?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{do you have a check for me?}
<A>__{seymour takes a filled out check from his shirt pocket. in the waiting room, we see seymour's mother.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{seymour? are you done? did you have a chance to think about what you might want for dinner while you were in there?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{we can talk about it in the car, ma...}
<A>__{as they leave seymour looks back and smiles weakly at the doctor.}
