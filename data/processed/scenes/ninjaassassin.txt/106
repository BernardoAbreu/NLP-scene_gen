<A>__{the fight is now two one against one, and one of them is takeshi. their swords crash back and forth, sending sparks flying. raizo is tired, already wounded by the shuriken... with a cry, he hurls a second ninja back and spins to face takeshi... too late. takeshi's blade gets under his guard. opens up raizo's side. his sword is ripped free from his hand, rebounds off a speeding sedan and clatters to the ground thirty feet away. raizo stumbles backward. life's blood dripping down and splattering on the concrete. takeshi raises his sword high. smiles.}

<D>__{this is the end for you, brother.}
<A>__{mika's car slashes across the width of the street screeching to a stop next to raizo. the door snaps open.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{raizo!}
<A>__{raizo gets into the car. collapses into the seat, arms wrapped tight around the ugly wound in his side. she peels away before the others can stop her. mika carves a path through the traffic, driving as fast as she can. eager to get more miles between them and the ninjas. raizo lets out a gasp as the car goes over a bump. his shirt is drenched with his own blood.}
<C>__{mika }
<D>__{what were you doing in the street?!}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{...waiting for you...}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{you have to go to a hospital.}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{no. not a hospital. another place.}
<A>__{the car speeds into the night.}
