<L>__{exterior hill district neighborhood night}
<A>__{not the best part of town. it looks rough even for the hill. the flashy car parks and david crosses the street. half a block back, john turns left at the corner and then makes a quick right into the alley. he guesses how many houses from the corner david stopped, gets out and checks over the fences. he stops a few houses away when he sees the porch light on a house flick on. david waits on the dilapidated back porch. he waves to whoever is watching him through the pinhole and the light goes out again. john inches closer as the back door opens. david exchanges a few words with whoever opened it and then packages are exchanged. the door closes and david walks off the way he came. john waits a moment, then moves down the alley, hops the fence, and sneaks through the twisted bramble of the back yard. he finds a place to hide, on the ground right beside the back porch. he pulls out his gun and settles in to wait between the trash cans, his heart pounding in his ears. fade to black. beat, then: bang! bang! bang!}
