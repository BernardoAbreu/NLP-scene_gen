<L>__{exterior bester's farm country day}
<A>__{the farm is a typical transvaal farm covering thousands of acres. in the distance there's a range of mountains. several cattle are grazing, herded by a poorly clad african and his son, aged 8 years. bester and ben are leaning on the wooden fence of the cattle kraal with calves penned in.}
<C>__{bester}
<D>__{everything was examined in depth in court.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{did you read the papers, dominee? were you happy with what came to light? and is it the magistrate's work to pretend that the facts which came to light didn't exist?}
<C>__{bester}
<D>__{was it really facts, ben?}
<A>__{just then the african "herdboy" walks up to them taking off his lattered greasy hat.}
<C>__{bester}
<D>__{ja? what is it tom?}
<C>__{tom }
<D>__{does the baas want me to bring the bull now?}
<C>__{bester}
<D>__{later, tom.}
<C>__{tom }
<D>__{dankie, baas.}
<A>__{tom hurries away.}
<C>__{bester}
<D>__{i bought a bull last week.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i know, gordon. what they said about him, that he was plotting against the government is a downright lie. he was only doing what i would have done as a father; searching for his son.}
<C>__{bester}
<D>__{no one but god can see what's in our hearts.}
<C>__{bester }
<D>__{isn't it presumptuous to pretend we can speak for someone else?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{have you no faith in your fellow men, dominee? don't you love your neighbor?}
<C>__{bester}
<P>__{(confronting ben)}
<D>__{wait a minute, instead of criticizing blindly, don't you think we have reason to be proud of the judiciary we have? suppose this had been russia; what do you think would have happened then?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what's the use of reaching a court when a handful of people have all the power to decide what is going to be said in that court and by whom? the one man they allowed to speak for himself, that young archibald chigorimbo, didn't he immediately deny everything they forced him to say in his statement? and the girl who spoke of her own torture?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{that did not refer to our situation in this south africa. do you know what i believe in, dominee, that once in one's life, just once, one should have enough faith in something to risk everything for it.}
<C>__{bester}
<D>__{one can gain the world and still lose one's soul. tea must be ready.}
<A>__{bester and ben walk towards the house still in conversation.}
