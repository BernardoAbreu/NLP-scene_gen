<L>__{92 e exterior comanche camp close shot scar night}
<A>__{he stands apart, warbow drawn and arrow notched. he releases it at his running target. we hear its impact and a high gasp of pain... and then the jubilant, yammering yells of other comanches.}
<L>__{92 f exterior a ridge full on martin and ethan as before night}
<A>__{the distant yammering of the comanches doesn't quite drown out one stifled scream of pain; we can surmise a scalping knife was busy in the last instance of brad's life. martin slumps in his saddle. ethan listens a moment, then turns to martin.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{let's just hope he took some with him...}
<A>__{he turns his horse back the way they had come. martin stares at him.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{what you goin' to do?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{get some sleep... tomorrow's another day...}
<A>__{slowly, he rides away. slowly, reluctantly but helpless to do otherwise, martin follows.}
