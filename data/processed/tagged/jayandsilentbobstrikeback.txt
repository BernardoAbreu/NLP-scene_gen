<B>__{chyron}
<A>__{a long time ago, in front of a convenience store far, far away }
<L>__{exterior quick stop years ago day}
<A>__{we fade in : on the block of stores (quick stop rst), from sometime ago, in fact, rst isn't rst; it's the record rack a 45's store with head shop paraphernalia in the window. a white trash mother (maybe seventeen) wearing a baseball cap comes into frame carrying a chubby baby. the baby wears an oversized t shirt under what looks like a little bathrobe, and messily eats a chocolate bar. there are food stamps in the mother's hands.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{bobby boy stay here while mommy picks up the free cheese, 'kay?}
<A>__{she looks up at the bright sun, shielding her eyes slightly, then looks back at the baby on the ground. she takes off her baseball cap and places it on the baby.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{this'll keep the sun out of your eyes. you be good now.}
<A>__{she walks away, leaving the baby sitting against the wall. with the backwards baseball cap and the chocolate around his mouth forming something that resembles a beard, the kid looks kind of familiar. then, another mother (also very young) decked out in a kiss concert shirt from years gone by and huge, feathered hair enters, with a black skullcap wearing baby slung at her hip. she sees the first baby, sitting against the wall and sets her baby down beside him.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{don't fucking move, you little shit machine. mommy's gonna try to score.}
<A>__{a passerby enters, heading toward the convenience store. he takes note of the babies and the mother heading into the record store, and then stops and addresses her, disgusted.}
<C>__{passerby}
<D>__{excuse me who's watching these babies?}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{the fat one's watching the little one.}
<C>__{passerby}
<D>__{oh, nice parenting.}

<C>__{jay}
<D>__{judge said if we go within a hundred feet of the stores, we get thrown into county.}

<P>__{(dawns on him)}
<D>__{oh my god don't tell me you have no idea there's a movie being made of the comic you two were the basis for.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what?! since when?}
<C>__{brodie}
<D>__{goddamit, man }
<P>__{(taps his wrist)}

<C>__{brodie}
<D>__{you see, kids, if you read wizard, you'd know it's the top story this month. check it out.}
<A>__{brodie hands jay and silent bob a copy of wizard, opened to the headline: snootchie bootchies! bluntman and chronic get big screen treatment! there are pictures of holden mcneil and banky edwards, as well as drawings of bluntman and chronic.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{when the fuck did this happen?!}
<C>__{brodie}
<D>__{well, after x men hit at the box office, all the studios started buying up every comic property they could get their hands on. miramax optioned bluntman and chronic.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{miramax? i thought they only made classy flicks like the piano and the crying game?}
<C>__{brodie}
<D>__{yeah, well once they made she's all that, everything went to hell. so you're saying you haven't gotten a cut of the movie? didn't holden mcneil and banky edwards used to pay you likeness rights for the comic book?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{we haven't seen a fucking dime for no movie!}
<C>__{brodie}
<D>__{well boys, i'm no lawyer, but i think holden and banky owe you some of the proverbial phat cash. i mean they're making a movie based on characters that are based on you and quiet robert.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{it ain't me and quiet robert. it's a pair of stupid ass superheroes that run around saying "snitchy nitchies" or something.}
<C>__{brodie}
<D>__{i believe it "snootchie boochies." regardless you're getting screwed. if i was you guys, i'd confront holden mcneil and ask him for my movie check.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{shit yeah. we gotsa get paid.}

<C>__{holden}
<D>__{no, i was just showering your mother's stink off me after i gave her a quick jump and sent her home. but now that you mention it }
<P>__{(to bob)}
<D>__{thanks, you know. you could've made the moral of that story you told me a bit more clear.}
<A>__{silent bob shrugs.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{so what brings you two dirt merchants to my neck of the woods?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{oh, i will tell you what our necks are doing in your woods }
<A>__{silent bob holds up the wizard article.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{where's our motherfucking movie check?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you heard about that too, hunh? well, i've got nothing to do with it. that's banky's deal. he owns the property now. i signed my half of the bluntman and chronic right over to him years ago.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{why the fuck would you do a thing like that?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{because i'm almost thirty, for god's sake why on earth would i want to keep writing about characters whose central preoccupations are weed and dick and fart jokes? you gotta grow, man. don't you ever want more for yourself?}
<P>__{(off silent bob)}
<D>__{i know this poor, hapless sonovabitch does. i look in his doe eyes and i see a man crying out, "when, lord? when the fuck can your servant ditch this foul mouthed little chucklehead to whom i am a constant victim of his folly, and who bombards me and those around us with grade a foolishness that prevents me from even getting to kiss a girl? fuck! when?!}
<A>__{silent bob nod like he's finally understood. jay looks at him, hurt, and bob tried to downplay the comment's truth.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i'm the chucklehead? fuck you you're the dumb ass who gave away his comic, and now you ain't got no fat movie check neither.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{when you're right, you're right. i wish i'd broken off a little piece for myself. because if the buzz is any indication, the movie's gonna make some huge bank.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what buzz?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{the internet buzz.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what the fuck is the internet?}
<L>__{interior office of potzer's inc later}
<A>__{holden's at a computer terminal. jay and silent bob look over his shoulder.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{the internet is a communication device that allows people the world over to bitch about movies and share pornography with one another.}

<D>__{here's what we're looking for: "movie poopshoot.com"}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(to bob)}
<D>__{"poopchute." yeaaahhh.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{this is a site full of militant movie buffs: sad bastards who live in their parents' basements, downloading scripts and trading what they believe to be inside info about movies and actors they despise yet can't stop discussing. this is where you go if you wanna hear frustrated would be filmmakers mouth off with their two bit, arm chair director's opinions on how they all could've made a better episode one.}
<A>__{on the computer monitor, we see the site mainpage load up. holden begins navigating the site.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{here. this is about the bluntman movie.}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"inside sources tell me miramax is starting production this friday on their adaptation of underground comic fave bluntman and chronic."}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{friday?! shit. does it say who's playing us in the movie?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{no, but if it's miramax, i'm sure it'll be ben affleck and matt damon. they put'em in a bunch of movies.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you know the guys from good will hunting.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you mean the fucking movie with mork from ork in it?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{yeah, i'm not too big a fan either. though affleck was the bomb in phantoms.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{word, bitch. phantoms like a motherfucker.}
<A>__{holden and jay slap hands. holden points at the monitor again.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{now down here is where you can gauge the buzz. this is the shoot back area. it's where people who read the news get to chime in with their two cents. here's what a guy who goes by the chick magnet net handle of "wampa one" thinks about bluntman and chronic.}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"bluntman and chronic and their stupid alter egos jay and silent bob only work in small doses, if at all. they don't deserve their own movie."}
<P>__{(to jay)}
<D>__{he's got a pointerior}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{fuck him. what's the next one say?}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"bluntman and chronic is the worst comic i ever read. jay and silent bob are stupid characters. a couple of stoners who spout dumb ass catchphrases like a third rate cheech and chong or bill and ted. fuck jay and silent bob. fuck them up their stupid asses."}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{who the fuck said that shit?!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{a guy who calls himself "magnolia fan." check out what the guy after him said: "jay and silent bob are terrible, one note jokes that only stoners laugh at. they're fucking clown shoes. if they were real, i'd beat the shit out of them for being so stupid. i can't believe miramax would have anything to so with this shit. i, for one, will be boycotting this movie. who's with me?"}
<P>__{(leans back)}
<D>__{and then there are about fifty more posts from people who agree to join spartacus here's boycott of the flick.}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{i'm gonna kill all these fucks }
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{ah, let it go. number one, they're a bunch of jealous little dicks who use the anonymity of the net to insult people who're doing what they wish they were doing, and number two, they're not really talking about you guys they talking about bluntman and chronic.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{but they said jay and silent bob! they used our real names. it doesn't matter that there's a comic book version of us and a real version, 'cause nobody knows we're real in real life.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{yeah! and all these people who read that shit think the real jay and silent bob are a couple of faggots 'cause of that all these dicks are writing about the comic book jay and silent bob! and maybe one night, me and lunchbox'll be macking some bitch, and she'll be like "oooo! i want to suck youse guys dicks off. what's your names?" and i will be like, "jay and silent bob." and she'll be like, "oh i read on the internet that youse guys were little fucking jerkoffs." and then she goes and sucks two other guys's dicks off instead! well fuck that! we gotta put a stop to these hateful sonsa bitches before they ruin our good names!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{first off, i don't know how good your names really are. secondly, there's not much you can do about stopping this bile. the internet's given everyone in america a voice, and everyone in american has chosen to use that voice to bitch about movies. as long as there's a bluntman and chronic movie, the net nerds are gonna have something negative to say about it. jay steams, thinking. then, a light dawns on him.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{but wait a second if there wasn't a bluntman and chronic movie, then no one would be saying shit about jay and silent bob, right?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{they're not saying anything about you now they're talking about fictional characters!}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(oblivious to holden; to bob)}
<D>__{so all we gotta do is stop 'em from making the movie!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{yeah, and kiss off the hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties you're due in the process. are you fucking retarded? look, i'm probably not alone in the opinion that this flick is the worst idea since greedo shooting first. i mean, a jay and silent bob movie? who would pay to see that?}
<A>__{holden, jay and silent bob pause and look at the camera for a beat. then }
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{but since it is happening, you might as well just ignore the idiots on the internet, go find banky, and get your "motherfucking movie check." as you so succinctly put it. that's what's important here.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{no, holden mcneil what's important here is that there's a bunch of motherfuckers we don't even know calling us assholes on the internet to a bunch of teenagers and guys who can't even get laid. putting a stop to that is the most important thing we could ever do.}
<P>__{(off monitor)}
<D>__{when did it say they're making that movie?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{they start this friday.}

<P>__{(counts)}
<D>__{eight days.}

<C>__{guy}
<D>__{the unwritten book of the road.}

<D>__{you want me to do it right now?}

<C>__{justice}
<D>__{how about a little "bitch, my man ain't yo baby's daddy"?}
<C>__{sissy}
<P>__{(beat; smiles)}
<D>__{bring it on.}
<A>__{justice rushes sissy and instead of sleek kung fu, they launch into a down and dirty, girl's cat fight; hair pulling and screaming. behind the bluntmobile, jay and bob watch all the action.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{yo i hope one of 'em rips the other one's shirt off and we see some tit.}
<A>__{both bob and jay smile at each other, nodding. banky joins them, crawling in on his belly, covering his head.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{mister biggs? mister van der beek? i just wanted to say hi. i'm }
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{banky fucking edwards! just the motherfucker we came to see!}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{holy shit! what the fuck are you guys doing here?!}
<A>__{sissy has justice on her belly, banging her face into the floor, screeching. jay, bob, and banky continue.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{stop the movie?! are you crazy?!}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{all these assholes are calling us names on the internet, 'cause of this stupid movie!}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{i feel for you boys i really do. those net snipers can be really cruel. but miramax paid me a shitload of money for bluntman and chronic, so it occurs to me that people bad mouthing you on some web site is none of my fucking concern!}
<C>__{silent bob}
<D>__{oh but i think it is.}
<A>__{banky stares at silent bob, agog, jay rolls his eyes.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{here we go again }
<C>__{silent bob}
<D>__{shut the fuck up.}
<P>__{(to banky)}
<D>__{we had a deal with you on the comics for likeness rights. and as we're not only the artistic basis but also the character basis for your intellectual property, bluntman and chronic, when we said property was optioned by miramax films you were legally obliged to secure our permission to transfer the concept to another medium. as you failed to do that, you're in breach of the original contract ergo, you find yourself in a very actionable position.}
<A>__{banky stares at bob, even more agog, joined by jay. after a beat, jay adds }
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{justice now has the advantage over sissy, holding her head and kicking her in the face, repeatedly, screaming.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{so, what do you guys want, to go away and take your lady friends with you?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{shitcan this movie so we don't get called names on the internet anymore.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{even if there's no movie, people are still free to talk shit about you on the internet. that's what the internet's for: slandering others anonymously. stopping the flick isn't going to stop that!}
<A>__{in the background, we see justice high kick sissy into the air.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{well this isn't fair! we went to hollywood, i fell in love, we stole a monkey, we got shot at, and got punched in the motherfucking nuts! we ain't leaving empty handed!}

<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what's up baby? you look good!}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{isn't that your girlfriend's enemy?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{oh yeah.}
<P>__{(pushing sissy off him)}
<D>__{get the fuck offa me, pig!}
<A>__{sissy races at justice, leaping atop her, pulling her hair. jay, bob, and banky continue.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{you guys are gonna ruin my movie career.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{well, we want something for our mental anguish.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{tell you what: we'll settle this monetarily. i will give you half of what i made.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{half?!?}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{half's not good enough? fine i will give you two thirds of what i made!}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{fuck you you already said half? you can't take it back!}
<A>__{silent bob rolls his eyes, banky shakes jay's hand.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{done}
<A>__{justice throws sissy off, onto the floor. both get up, facing each other.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{your shit is so tired, justice!}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{call me boo boo kitty fuck bitch!}
<A>__{justice high kicks sissy and she goes flying across the stage. sissy sails toward the craft service table, landing atop missy and chrissy, knocking them out. willenholly stands to see why the girls stopped shooting.}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{hello? truce?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i think i killed both of them.}
<A>__{suddenly, he lets out a shriek and falls forward, revealing a tranquilizer dart in his ass, and suzanne standing behind him, holding the gun up in the air. justice surveys her handiwork for a beat, then calls off toward the bluntmobile.}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{c'mon guys. it's over.}
<A>__{jay, bob, and banky pop up from behind the car and join her.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{yo, i was just about to jump in there and get your back.}
<A>__{then, the sound of sirens rings out in the distance.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{holy shit, the cops! we gotta get out of here!}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{no. i'm tired of running.}
<A>__{justice lifts willenholly into a sitting position and taps his face.}

<D>__{you awake, marshal? marshal?}
<C>__{willenholly}
<P>__{(tries to move but can't)}
<D>__{oh my god, i'm paralyzed. the monkey shot me in the ass and paralyzed me! oh the irony!}
<C>__{justice}
<P>__{(off suzanne's gun)}
<D>__{you're not paralyzed. it was just a tranquilizer.}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{jesus! tranqued by a little monkey! my friends in the bureau are never gonna let me live this down!}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{you have friends in the f.b.i.?}
<C>__{willenholly}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{they all made it in, but i failed the exam. why the hell else do you think i became a federal wildlife marshal? 'cause i'm a joke!}
<A>__{justice looks toward the direction of the sirens, thinking. then }
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{maybe not. i can make you a deal that'll get you into the f.b.i., regardless of test scores.}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{what kind of deal?}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{you drop the charges against jay and silent bob and say you never found the ape. make sure the world knows they're not in control of any c.l.i.t.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{now wait a second }
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{i will explain later, jay}
<P>__{(to willenholly)}
<D>__{in exchange, i will give you the diamonds i stole, and turn in sissy, missy, chrissy, and myself. but i want a reduced sentence.}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{you'd be willing to do that?}
<C>__{justice}
<P>__{(off jay)}
<D>__{for him? i'd be willing to do anything.}
<A>__{justice stands and takes jay by the hands.}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{i'm an international jewel thief who's facing a jail sentence.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{that's alright. i'm a junkie with a monkey.}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{if i go to prison, will you wait for me?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i don't know. will we fuck when you get out?}

<D>__{don't change the subject. will we fuck when you get out?}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{snoogans.}
<A>__{justice and jay kiss again. suzanne reached up to silent bob, who picks her up. she grabs his face and kisses him. willenholly looks to banky.}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{wow. there's a lot of love in the room.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{regardless of what you may have heard. i do not kiss guys.}

<D>__{what here?}
<A>__{jay looks at justice, confused, as the cruiser pulls away, leaving jay, bob, suzanne, and banky. they start walking down the lot.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{well, boys you're rich in love }
<P>__{(indicating jay)}
<D>__{well, you're in love. and to top that off, you've got your own monkey. what more could two guys from jersey possibly want?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{all those fucks to stop talking shit about us on the internet, for starters.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{what do i keep telling you? there's not much you can do to stop that. well, short of showing up at all their houses and beating the shit out of them, i guess.}
<A>__{jay and bob suddenly freeze. they look at each other and smile.}
