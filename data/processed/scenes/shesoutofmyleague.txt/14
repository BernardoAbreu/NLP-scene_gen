<L>__{interior vertigo club night}
<A>__{kirk comes in and stops at the bar to order a beer. two men are waving to him from a table near the stage. kirk gets his bottle and snakes through the crowd toward his friends. on stage, stainer (in his afro wig) plays guitar as his band finishes the last chorus of "lovin', touchin' squeezin'."}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{thank you! we're going to take a little breakski but we'll be back in a few minutes to do frontiers.}
<A>__{the band turns to put down their instruments and the house music kicks in. kirk arrives where his friends are standing at a high bar table. devon looks like howdy doody at 33. jack is good looking and dressed semi hipster. devon gives kirk a hug.}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{hey kirk. how you been holdin' up?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{it's been a rough week but, you know, all of the services and family stuff keep you pretty busy... i really miss her, though.}
<A>__{jack hugs kirk as well.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she sounded like a hell of a lady.}
<C>__{stainer }
<D>__{oh, fuck yeah! kirk's grandma was the shit.}
<A>__{stainer arrives, hugs kirk and gives him a kiss on the head.}
<C>__{stainer }
<D>__{she's with god now, buddy and you just know she's bustin' his balls.}
<A>__{kirk laughs and stainer raises his glass.}
<C>__{stainer }
<D>__{to stella!}
<A>__{the guys all raise their glasses and take a drink. this is just what grammy wanted and it's cheering kirk up. kirk's cell phone rings. he has to talk loud over the music.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{hello?... oh, hi. i'm sorry i can barely hear you. i'm at a club and.... club vertigo? oh, yeah it's right down the street from there... okay, sounds good.}
<A>__{kirk hangs up.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what was that all about?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{nothing, just a passenger. she accidentally left something with me. she's going to stop in and pick it up i guess.}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{she's coming here? she a cute gal?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{very.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{well alright dude! that's a leave behind. she digs you!}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no she doesn't. trust me.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{she does a leave behind and then just happens to be in the neighborhood? she practically has her hands in your pants.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no, seriously it's nothing. she's way out of my league.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{dude, you said marnie was out of your league and let's face it, marnie's kinda nasty.}
<A>__{marnie is standing behind stainer. he doesn't miss a beat.}
<C>__{stainer }
<D>__{...marnie...don't you think marnie tomkins is kind of nasty?}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{i don't know who that is.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{oh, you don't know marnie tomkins? she's just this girl. i thought you knew her. anyway, she's pretty nasty looking... but you're looking good.}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{kirk, i'm sorry about grammy.}
<A>__{the guys slink away to give kirk and marnie some privacy.}
<C>__{marnie }
<D>__{i realize she was never that crazy about me but i know how much you loved her and i hope you're okay.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{thanks. thanks, i will be alright.}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{listen, are you going to branson with your folks next month?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no. it's not really my thing.}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{what's wrong with branson? you too good for branson now?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no. branson's...awesome.}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{well, your mom invited ron and i along. we'd love to go but not if it's going to be weird for you.}
<A>__{kirk considers this. it will be weird.}
<C>__{marnie }
<D>__{...i mean the tickets are non refundable but it's up to you.}
<A>__{stainer overhears this and groans out loud.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no. you should go. i'm sure you'll have a great time. totally.}
<A>__{marnie hugs kirk. this makes him uncomfortable.}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{kirk, i'm sorry about what happened with us. you're going to make someone very happy someday, but you have to get over me first, okay? is it a deal?}
<A>__{marnie hugs him again and then departs.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{she's going to branson with your fucking parents? and bringing her new fucking boyfriend!?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{yeah. he seems like a good guy, though. he's an entrepreneur.}
<A>__{across the room they see marnie return to ron with a hug.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{entrepreneur? kirk, i know that guy. he owns a pizza hut.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{so? that's a business.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{it's not even a real pizza hut. it's one of those strip mall take out ones. they don't even have chicken wings. the guy's a fuckin' douche bag.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{he's got more going on than i do. that's all i'm saying.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{dude, you can do a hell of a lot better than her.}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{one door closes, another door opens.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{fuck you devon, that doesn't even make any sense. but take this broad that's coming here tonight i got a feeling about her. you're gonna get on that.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{absolutely. visualize it.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i appreciate what you guys are trying to do but, i'm telling you, i have zero chance with this one and i'm completely okay with that.}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{that's defeatist thinking.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no it isn't. it's just like saying i will never go to the moon and i'm okay with that too.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{you're saying you don't want to go to the moon? that's bullshit.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no. i'm saying that i never will go to the moon but i'm not going to get down about it because, you know i never expected to.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{you don't know. technology and shit. you might go to the moon.}
<A>__{kirk waves to someone at the door. the guys look up. the guys' pov: molly is stepping toward them dressed in a beautiful gown. they laugh the way you might laugh at a particularly brutal football tackle.}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{holy frijole.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh shit. yeah, you're right.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{sorry, bro. you'll go to the moon before you'll hit that. no chance.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i told you.}
<A>__{molly arrives at their table.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{hey! there you are!}
<A>__{molly hugs kirk. from across the bar, marnie takes notice.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{here i am.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i'm sorry i'm so overdressed. i just came from a work thing. are you doing okay with...everything?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh, you know... hey, these are my best friends jack, devon and stainer.}
<A>__{the guys' i.q.s drop like stones as they shake her hand.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{stainer?}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{yeah, just a nickname. doesn't really mean nothin'.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh. here's your pictures all safe and sound.}
<A>__{kirk hands molly the pictures.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{thank you so much for taking care of them for me! i need to get some copies made. if i lost these...uugh.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no trouble at all.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{hey, have you eaten yet?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{um...}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i was going to go grab a bite. let me buy you dinner to pay you back.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you don't have to pay me back.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i know. i want to. come on! the place across the street has the best greasy burgers in town.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{a burger does sound good. (then to the guys) i'm going to just ah...}
<A>__{molly waves goodbye and heads for the door. kirk starts to follow but stainer pulls him back for a quick huddle.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{dude. it's cool that she's buying you dinner but do not get your hopes up about this one.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{don't worry. believe me, i know.}
<A>__{kirk catches up with molly. marnie watches them exit. a big guy has overheard this and leans over to stainer.}
<C>__{big guy}
<D>__{good advice there friend. your boy ain't got a prayer with that chick.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{you talking shit about my buddy!? 'cause i'm giving out free fuckin' ambulance rides!}
<A>__{big guy assesses the crazy on stainer's face and stands down.}
<C>__{stainer }
<D>__{yeah, i didn't think so!}
