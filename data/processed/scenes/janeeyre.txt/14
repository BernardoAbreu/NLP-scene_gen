<A>__{jane is crawling through the narrow garden. on her knees, she peers through a window. on either side of a bright little fire sit two young women. they look exactly like jane; slight, neat, dressed in black. one, diana, has her hair slightly curled and hides her gentle eyes behind spectacles. the other, mary, is very young; no more than seventeen. each has a book on her knee. they are talking intimately. they look so close, so loving and the room looks so cosy that it pains jane considerably.}
