<L>__{interior trailer night}
<A>__{there is a radio box mounted on the far wall of the trailer. the speaker buzzes urgently with eddie's voice.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{sarah, malcolm, can you hear me?!}
<A>__{on the table, sarah is frantically molding nick's bubblegum into place on the makeshift splinterior but the baby rex, regaining its strength, is thrashing again.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{hold it down, nick!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i'm trying!}
<C>__{eddie }
<P>__{(from the radio)}
<D>__{is anybody there?!}
<A>__{malcolm moves to answer the radio, but sarah shouts to him.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{ian, get the bottle of amoxicillin and fill a syringe! quick injection of antibiotics and i can get it out of here!}
<A>__{forsaking the radio, malcolm moves to the medicine drawer and comes up with what she wants. working fast, he draws twenty cc's of the pink liquid.}
<C>__{eddie }
<P>__{(still from the radio, now desperate)}
<D>__{sarah or ian, answer me!}
<A>__{they ignore him as sarah grabs the syringe and makes the injection.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{whatever you brought into the trailer, get it out now!}
