<A>__{the pig bangs the gong. the crowd goes wild! they cheer! they scream! confetti falls! a palanquin is carried past shifu.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{stop! wait! who told you to ?}
<A>__{po stands there, utterly stunned, his mouth hanging open. he is abruptly lifted up out of shot. cut to the palace geese straining. po is being lifted with great effort on the palanquin. he is carried off. shifu elbows his way urgently through the thronging crowd to get to oogway.}
<C>__{shifu }
<D>__{master oogway, wait! that flabby panda can't possibly be the answer to... our problem. you were about to point at tigress. that thing fell in front of her. that was just an accident!}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{there are no accidents.}
<A>__{oogway smiles benignly as we hear an off screen crash! the camera adjusts to reveal the palanquin has collapsed under po. shifu looks at oogway. oogway just smiles. a squad of burly pigs rushes in and hoists po, the palanquin, and the geese onto their shoulders, and they head off for the jade palace. stunned, shifu watches them go. behind him, the five approach and bow.}
<C>__{tigress}
<D>__{forgive us, master. we have failed you.}
<A>__{shifu spins around.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{no. if the panda has not quit by morning, then i will have failed you.}
<A>__{confetti flutters through the air as the celebration continues around them.}
