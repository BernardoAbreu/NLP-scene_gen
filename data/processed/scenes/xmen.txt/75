<L>__{interior gymnasium night}
<A>__{on first glance, the gym looks really average. a fairly standard boxing ring in the middle. a fairly standard weight set nearby. then you notice the weights themselves are abnormally large.}
<L>__{100. 200. 300. 400 pounds. all the way up to 2000.}
<A>__{and that is just one stack. cyclops enters first with logan coming in behind him.}
<C>__{cyclops}
<D>__{how long have you been in alaska?}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{i donit remember. is that what you wanted to ask me?}
<A>__{logan is barely through the door when cyclops whips around on logan and thumps his finger into his chest.}
<C>__{cyclops}
<D>__{i just wanted to make you clear on something. personally, i donit care what magneto wants with you. he can take those claws of yours and use them for barbecue skewers. what i do care about is the safety of this group. the professor is in charge, and after the professor, thereis me. so, for the remainder of your time here, youire going to keep that killer instinct of yours locked down so no one else gets hurt.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(smirks)}
<D>__{iive served with men like you before. methodical. systematic naive. you know what happens to those men in a real fight?}
<C>__{cyclops}
<D>__{you know, you }
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{shut up. i got no interest in you, xavier,}
<P>__{(he points mockingly at the xis on cyclopsi uniform)}
<D>__{or your... x men.}
<A>__{logan takes him in for a moment.}
<C>__{logan }
<D>__{and i donit think this has anything to do with my ikiller instinct.i you just donit like the way iim looking at your girl or maybe you donit like the way sheis looking back. and maybe you think youire man enough to do something about it.}
<A>__{cyclops is enraged. a red light begins to glow around the edge of his visor and the ruby quartz lens brightens. we can faintly hear the low hum of immense power that is now barely contained. before cyclops can even react, logan puts his fist against cyclopsi throat. shook! logan extends one claw up one side of cyclopsi neck. he smiles.}
<C>__{logan }
<D>__{cimon sport. you think you can blow the meat off my bones before i gut you? letis find out.}
<A>__{the air is now charged with tension. the two men are about to attack when }
<C>__{xavier }
<D>__{cyclops!}
<A>__{logan whirls and sees xavier regarding them sternly. logan turns his building anger on xavier.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{i have a question for you, chuck. whatis the point?}
<A>__{xavier sits calmly as logan, claws still extended, marches over to him.}
<C>__{xavier}
<D>__{the point of what?}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{this. this whole god damn thing.}
<P>__{(derisively, at cyclops)}
<D>__{making yourselves into some sort of iteami of super powered freaks. teaching wayward mutants about classical literature. for what?}
<A>__{logan continues to advance on xavier. cyclops moves to stop logan, but xavier waves him off.}
<C>__{xavier}
<D>__{the point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility. to recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{what if it never happens? what if theyire so afraid of us that we become the enemy? this place is gonna be one giant cemetery.}
<A>__{xavier has heard this argument before.}
<C>__{xavier}
<D>__{now thatis magneto talking.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{no. thatis me talking. and you know what? itis only been thirty two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.}
<C>__{xavier}
<D>__{i believe he wants you for your adamantium.}
<A>__{logan raises his hand to his chest grasping for something that no longer hangs from his neck.}
<C>__{xavier }
<D>__{youire thinking of your dog tag. it was made of adamantium wasnit it?}
<C>__{jean }
<D>__{professor.}
<A>__{logan turns and sees jean walking towards them.}
<C>__{xavier}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{rogue's missing.}
<A>__{logan looks at jean with concern.}
