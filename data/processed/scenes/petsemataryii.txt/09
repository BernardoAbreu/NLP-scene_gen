<L>__{exterior pleasantville cemetery day}
<A>__{we drift down from the gray sky to the somber scene below. off in the distance, a crowd of mourners are gathered around a grave.}
<C>__{priest }
<D>__{...i am the resurrection and the life, saith the lord...}
<A>__{closer the headstone is adorned with an iron plaque. it reads, simply:}
<B>__{renee hallow matthews}
<L>__{1955 1991}
<C>__{priest }
<D>__{...she that believeth in me, though she were dead, yet shall she live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die...}
<A>__{the casket is slowly lowered into the open grave. as it descends, we see geoff and his father, chase, standing at the forefront of the crowd. renee's grave is next to those of her parents. among the mourners is marjorie hargrove, an attractive local girl in her early twenties. further down the hillside, a wall of news reporters are gathered behind a roped off media boundary. there is a blinding flurry of photo flashes as the press records the scene before them. a sheriff's department patrol car cruises up the cemetery drive, pulling to a stop near the mob of reporters. out of the car steps gus gilbert. gus is nearly forty, with a sheriff's uniform fitted to his solid, ageless frame. gruff, maybe a little self important: gus likes being a big fish in a small pond.}
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(drawing near)}
<D>__{let's keep it back, folks. try to show her a little respect...}
<A>__{a reporter ducks under the media boundary, moving in for a closer shot. he doesn't make it two steps before he's intercepted by gus. gus grabs the reporter and shoves him back.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{hey! what did i just say?}
<A>__{gus means business. one look into his eyes reveals his intense, no nonsense approach.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{ass hole...}
<A>__{the reporter backs off. back at the graveside beneath the gloomy, ominous skies, the lines on chase's face shade him as a decade older than his thirty five years. chase gently places a comforting hand on geoff's shoulder. geoff inches forward, pulling free of chase's touch. drawn to his mother, drawn from his father. the only blemishes on his youthful, rosy cheeks are the tears, the endless tears.}
<C>__{priest }
<D>__{i know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth.}
<A>__{geoff looks upon the casket, gazing into the abyss of despair.}
<B>__{following the ceremony}
<A>__{the crowd has dispersed. geoff is standing at the base of renee's grave. his eyes fixed. unmoving. unaccepting. chase is nearby, watching, not wanting to intrude on geoff's private moment. gus quietly moves in at chase's side.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{did she always have reporters following her around like this?}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{pretty much so.}
<A>__{gus glances at geoff.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i hear you moved into town.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{i wanted to get geoff out of l.a. just start things over, you know?}
<A>__{gus nods. now his eyes fall on renee's headstone.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i remember when renee left. she couldn't wait to get out of ludlow. she used to say that life moved too slow here...}
<A>__{chase forces a smile.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{that's renee alright.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i suppose so.}
<A>__{the sky above seems heavy with imminent rain and we...}
