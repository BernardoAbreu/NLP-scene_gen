<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{the train's wheels racing down the track.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior cary's compartment in the heat of the evening}
<A>__{the compartment doorway. we hear the men laughing. bill drink in hand, his necktie loosened and his coat off appears in the doorway, coming from the train's corridor.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{hi, men! look what i found.}
<A>__{with a grand gesture, bill presents an elderly british gentleman who follows him into the little room, greeted with a cheer of "hooray!" from the men who sit around, similarly coatless (save frink), smoking and drinking. various bottles stand on a central table. the old gentleman is greeted warmly but it's never clear whether he is an old friend or a total stranger.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{come in.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{sit down.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{have a drink.}
<C>__{gentleman}
<D>__{ah, thank you, no, not i.}
<A>__{bill and the old gentleman sit down. nikki dozes in her seat by the window. the basket of turtles hangs from above.}
<C>__{gentleman}
<D>__{i i say, are you all going to portugal?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{yup. we're going down there to investigate conditions.}
<C>__{gentleman}
<D>__{investigate conditions?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{drinking conditions, mostly.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{by the way, what are conditions?}
<C>__{gentleman}
<D>__{don't you know what conditions are?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{no. never saw one in my life.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{the drinking conditions are pretty bad right here.}
<C>__{gentleman}
<P>__{(chuckles skeptically, glancing at the bottles)}
<D>__{ahh, indeed.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{my beer's full of cinders.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{good for ya. make ya lay hard shelled eggs.}
<A>__{the men laugh. a whistle blows. the conductor appears briefly in the doorway to announce in french that the mademoiselle's compartment is ready.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{nikki? the man says your compartment's ready.}
<A>__{nikki wakes, rises, and clutching her pillow, heads for the doorway.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i'm glad on account of it's been so hot and i'm so tired and i want to go to bed.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{going to bed? who ever heard of such a thing?}
<A>__{bill rises to confer with her at the door.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{can we help you undress?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{no, thank you, william.}
<A>__{the old gentleman looks rather astonished at this casual exchange.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{take off your shoes?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{undo your hair?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{scrub your back or something?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{no, i can manage quite well by myself. good night, everybody.}
<A>__{the men say, "good night." frink, who has been watching nikki with a predatory eye, is the most polite:}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{good night, nikki.}
<A>__{nikki turns and disappears down the corridor. the old gentleman mops his brow with a handkerchief and stuffs it in his collar.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{can you imagine that ungrateful old trollop? she wouldn't let them help her undress.}
<C>__{gentleman}
<D>__{can't understand it at all.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{you know, she's not very pretty. but when she was a little girl, her mother always said she had the nicest hair ribbons.}
<C>__{gentleman}
<D>__{indeed?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{she got one tooth turned around, she can't see very far, and she's always speaking out of turn. otherwise, she's a mighty fine piece of architecture.}
<C>__{gentleman}
<D>__{mm, seems to need a few repairs.}
<A>__{during the next exchange, frink, seated by the door, grins at bill and shep, then notices francis dozing off. frink cautiously rises and exits into the corridor without anyone noticing his departure.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{she's got eyes like an assyrian queen's got eyes.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you ain't never seen no assyrian queen! you're just a makin' that up outta yore own head!}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{i did so see an assyrian queen.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{in whose green hat?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{in the metropolitan museum's green hat, that's whose green hat.}
<A>__{francis' pocket watch chimes. he wakes, rises, puts on his hat and moves absently toward the door. seeing this, shep, bill and cary shout at him: "whoa!" francis pauses in the doorway and sleepily turns to the others.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{hold on there! where you goin'?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{you're not going anywhere. you're on a train.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{you go back to your turtles, hear? you've been neglecting your assignment.}
<A>__{francis moves to the hanging basket of turtles, takes off his hat and, bottle in hand, wets his fingers and sprinkles the turtles. curious, the old gentleman rises to join him. francis explains as he works:}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{i have to sprinkle the turtles, see?}
<C>__{gentleman}
<D>__{sprinkle the turtles?}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{the old gentleman nods and clicks his tongue with understanding.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{cool 'em off.}
<C>__{gentleman}
<D>__{hm?}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{turtles get feverish on trains.}
<C>__{gentleman}
<D>__{ahh! uh huh.}
<A>__{a woman's scream drifts in from the corridor.}
<C>__{nikki's voice}
<D>__{cary!}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{gentleman}
<D>__{hm?}
<A>__{the men hear nikki screaming.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{nikki!}
<A>__{francis, cary, bill and shep in that order scramble out the door, leaving the old gentleman behind.}
<C>__{nikki's voice}
<D>__{cary! bill! shep!}
<A>__{the men rush down the corridor to:}
