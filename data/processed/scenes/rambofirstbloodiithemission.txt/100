<A>__{brewer seems to have lost sight of rambo. he scans the camp to the treeline and back. the filterless cigarette is smoked almost to his lips. wham! a booted foot smashes down on his rifle, pinning one hand. he looks up at... a north vietnamese guard who holds an ak 47 in brewer's face. with his headphones on brewer hadn't heard the quiet approach from behind. brewer closes his eyes in profound misery. there is a soft thunk. brewer opens his eyes as the ak 47 falls into the grass. looks up to see... the guard is leaning back against a tree, motionless. the vaned tail of a crossbow bolt protrudes from his neck under the jaw. he is pinned to the tree, quite dead. rambo appears from the undergrowth, still carrying de fravio, crossbow in hand.}
