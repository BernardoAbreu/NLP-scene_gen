<L>__{interior thomas' apartment dawn}
<A>__{flashing lights from rescue vehicles illuminate the living room. in the newly conformed safe house, kat and clear relax as best they can in thomas' dry clothes. thomas makes another phone call. in the corner, eugene shivers to himself. desperately looking for signs of danger. he looks over to clear.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{um, clear? i'm sorry...about before. i...}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{your entire world view just went out the window. i couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. we'll get through this.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i promise.}
<A>__{eugene looks immensely relieved. rory ambles over to kimberly, his typical callousness gone.}
<C>__{rory}
<D>__{can i ask you a question?}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{rory}
<D>__{when i die. is it gonna hurt?}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{i...i don't know.}
<A>__{rory nods. he expected as much. he fishes his license and keys out of his pocket.}
<C>__{rory}
<D>__{and you're gonna die after me, right?}

<P>__{(tears well up)}
<D>__{could you throw all my drugs out? paraphernalia, porno, you know... anything that would break my mom's heart.}
<A>__{kimberly looks deeply into his eyes, looking for the punchline. when she doesn't see one, she nods tenderly and takes the keys. the phone rings. rory jumps at the sound, paranoid eyes in scan mode. thomas answers, speaks softly, hangs up.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{a one very pissed off ms. isabella cruz is being detained up in greenwood. let's finish this thing.}
