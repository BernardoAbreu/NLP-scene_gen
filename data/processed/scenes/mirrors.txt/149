<L>__{interior night mirror room subterranean passageways}
<A>__{in the basement, the calm has been restored. ben is still crouching behind the sheltering wall of the mirror room. in the silence, he waits. he must establish beyond a doubt that it's all over. he aims his flashlight at the surface of the water everything seems to be back to normal. his reflection is deformed by the slight stir of the water, slowly becoming placid. ben steps over the rubble to enter the mirror room all the mirrors have been pulverized leaving behind only the metal cage that was holding them in place. the floor is covered with thousands of pieces of mirror floating in the water, shimmering in the shadows. the beam of the flashlight sweeps the room in search of anna, or her dead body nothing... ben inspects all the dark corners behind the metal structure the woman has vanished. he aims his flashlight at the ceiling. the beam of light instantly reveals a dark shape hanging above him it's her, or at least what is left of her a possessed, metamorphosed, human frame. she is barely recognizable. with her eyes rolled upward, her slashed face and her body pierced by the shards of glass, she looks like a demon, deprived}
<B>__{of any human traits. the real anna disappeared from the moment she opened her eyes and released the forces of the mirror.}
<A>__{ben has no time to react before "anna" charges at him. he drops his flashlight to the ground, trying to resist her as much as he can.}
<B>__{her way of moving is no longer human. more like a stroboscopic}
<A>__{convulsion, her movements are something between an enraged beast}
<B>__{and the worst epileptic fit.}
<A>__{ben manages to pin the creature against the wall. "anna" spits blood in his face. he applies all his strength to immobilize her the shards of glass dig deeper into the elderly woman's flesh, which only seems to provide her an intense pleasure... "anna" froths at the mouth. her speech has become a deep, animalistic, incomprehensible gurgle. in an effortless movement, "anna" pushes him away. her demonic strength is ten times his. ben is merely a puppet, a rag doll that she sends flying into the air, only to crash violently against the brick walls... blood squirts onto the surface of the water. ben smashes into the wall separating the mirror room from the underground passageways. on the other side, he lands on the ground, in the dark. he strives to regain consciousness... ben takes advantage of the brief respite to pull out his gun but "anna" appears from the dark and, in a flash, she strikes a backhanded blow that sends the gun off into the air. she lifts ben up and throws him across the room. he rams into the wall. with the absence of light in the basement, ben is defenseless. he cannot see his assailant... ben is caught by the leg and dragged backwards. his hand struggles to catch on to anything that could hold him back. suddenly, under the water, his hand lands on the gun. he grabs it, turns onto his back, and fires point blank at "anna". the bullets go flying through her body, but they don't stop her. ben is being dragged. he manages to grab hold of one pipe after the other, trying to hold on, but the pipe gives way and breaks off from the wall, letting out a powerful jet of gas. once again, ben is sent flying down the tunnel. he struggles to get back on his feet apart from the sound of the flowing gas, a disturbing silence surrounds the subterranean passageways. ben makes out "anna's" silhouette, hiding behind the leaking gas pipe. with his bloodied face, ben is no longer the same man anymore something in his eyes has shifted. rage and violence have replaced the terror and dread. he is determined to put an end to the creature, no matter what happens. he slides the weapon in his belt and steps, with his bare hands, towards what once was "anna"... crouched over in the water, the demon looks up, ready to charge. ben takes another step forward with the same determination. the creature thrusts itself against him the clash is extremely violent. ben uses all his strength to keep his assailant's jaw at a distance. in a swift movement, ben turns around and impales "anna" on the broken gas pipe!}
<B>__{in a gush of blood the sharp metal tip pierces through her}
<A>__{stomach but despite being momentarily immobilised, the demon seems unaffected by the near total destruction of its outer shell. on the contrary, it struggles more violently to escape from the trap. ben moves away, keeping an eye on "anna". he takes his gun and aims it at her. ben is exhausted. with his arm outstretched, he is ready to shoot, waiting for the right moment. the silhouette suddenly emerges from the dark. ben stands by the demon goes through the cloud of gas ben fires the explosion is instantaneous. "anna" is engulfed in flames.}
<B>__{the fire spreads through the tunnels.}
<A>__{ben throws himself to the ground to avoid the flames. suddenly, in a domino effect, one explosion follows the other. a blast occurs a bit further down the tunnel, and another inside}
<B>__{the walls.}
<A>__{the subterranean passageways are about to collapse cracks appear everywhere. the brick walls begin to fall apart. a part of the ceiling at the far end of the corridor caves in. ben gets back on his feet and dashes for the stairs. totally burnt, flesh charred, "anna" is enraged by her prey's resistance. the blazing demon runs after ben. behind them, one after the other, sections of the walls collapse. ben runs as fast as he can. "anna" is coming closer to him, when suddenly just behind ben, a section of the ground floor caves in, burying}
<B>__{her under a mass of rubble.}
<A>__{ben narrowly escaped the collapse. he reaches the staircase and catches sight of the exit above when suddenly }
<B>__{the entire foundation of the building collapses over him.}
<A>__{ben finds himself crushed along the floor and penetrates the mirroring water surface disappearing on the other side of the}
<B>__{mirror.}
