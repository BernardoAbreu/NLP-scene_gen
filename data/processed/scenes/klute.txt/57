<C>__{bree }
<D>__{look please will you just try to get it from my side? a year ago. i was in the life fulltime. i was living on park with leather furniture and a million dresses. then they dropped on me, the fuzz, they caged me they started asking me about a man, some man, i'm supposed to have seen a year before that. two years ago, two. he could be in yemen!}
<A>__{she waits for klute to respond he doodles permissively on his pad of paper she goes on.}
<C>__{bree }
<D>__{a name. grunemann. nothing. and they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. then they asked me, well had i been getting letters, from someone out there in cabbageville }
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{ tuscarora }
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{all right, yes, i had been. those sick, wild letters i'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. well, they said, all right that's grunemann. so try to remember when you and he when well i don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper }
<P>__{(explains)}
<D>__{dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. a man hired me once, then tried to really kill me that'd be about two years ago.}

<D>__{what?}
<P>__{(then )}
<D>__{what do you remember about that dumper?}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{nothing. except he wasn't kidding. usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. they pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you }

<D>__{but you can't say that dumper was tom grunemann.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{i can't say he was anybody!}

<C>__{klute}
<D>__{what about everything since?}
<A>__{she draws back again. up to now she's been reasonably on top of things. starting now we see her driven toward the things she'd really rather not talk about and increasingly more shaken.}
<C>__{klute }
<P>__{(prompts)}
<D>__{everything that's happened since tom grunemann disappeared. the phone calls and the }
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{just phone calls, right? they ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. kids getting kicks. burglars looking for an empty apartment. i mean there is nothing that proves }

<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm sure this will amuse you; i'm scared of the dark. and sometimes i get shook up, i hear people or well, i will come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little trash outside my door and i wonder if someone left it there for do you see? things other people wouldn't even notice. well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with }

<D>__{you saw that, goddamn you? you saw it? he's seventy. his wife's dead. he started cutting garments at fourteen. his whole life, he's maybe had a week's vacation, i'm all he has and he never, never touches me, and what harm in it, what }
<A>__{she chokes then goes on }
<C>__{bree }
<D>__{klute, tell me, what's your bag? are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young children or get your chest walked around with high heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? or }

<D>__{ you perverted hypocrite square bastards.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{something in his inflection very slight cautions her. she falls silent as suddenly as she began. then cheerfully }

<D>__{when?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{when did you and ligourin break up?}

<C>__{klute}
<D>__{ ok?}
<C>__{bree}
<P>__{(ingenuously)}

<C>__{klute}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<A>__{at this point or about this point klute takes note of something. a little above her. he grows more watchful, but containing it carefully. we don't understand the change in his manner or even notice; she doesn't. in mock dismay }
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{gee. i've had men pay two hundred dollars for me here, you're turning down a freebie.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you can get a perfectly good dishwasher for that.}
