<A>__{two apache attack helicopters (silent) appear from their hiding place behind a nearby building. as they dive into their attack trajectory hub (silent) crawls, dragging tariq toward the doors as: the chain gun (silent) of the attack helicopter fires 2,000 rounds a minute virtually unzipping the warehouse softening it for the two hydra rockets that reduce it instantly to a huge fireball. in the chopper devereaux watches the awesome display of firepower with calm detachment. inside the warehouse two shadowy figures stagger, blinded, out of the inferno. hub drags a half conscious tariq, where they are pounced on by commandos.}
