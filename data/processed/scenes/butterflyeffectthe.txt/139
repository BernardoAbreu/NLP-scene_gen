<L>__{exterior prison yard day}
<A>__{evan and carlos sit on bleachers that overlook the other prisoners working out. evan closely watches karl and rick who stare daggers at him from across the yard. a skinhead passes something with a white taped handle to karl but no officers seem to notice. evan slides closer to carlos and stares at the jesus christ tattoos all over carlos' back.}
