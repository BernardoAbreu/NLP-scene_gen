<L>__{exterior morning moments later surf's up wave pool south}
<A>__{we see several rolling trash cans lined up in a row, along with several janitorial carts filled with cleaning utensils and supplies. the colonel is standing, dressed in army fatigue pants and a water world golf shirt, with a green water world baseball cap. he is wearing black horn rim glasses, thick lenses, and carrying a clipboard. lined up as if an army unit are ten grounds kids, including robbie, who is sixth furthest from the colonel. they are all younger than robbie except one, eddie, whom we met at the beginning of the film. eddie is standing tall and straight, proud to be there. he is nearest the colonel}
<C>__{the colonel}
<P>__{(looking up from clipboard)}
<D>__{well, it looks like we have a good staff here. yes...yes a good staff. it will be an excellent summer. remember as we go through training today, our park is judged by the work we do. if we do it well, the people come back.}
<P>__{(walking up and down the line)}
<D>__{we have a little tradition here on the grounds crew. rather than having to learn a lot of names, many of which i can never hope to pronounce properly, each grounds crew member gets a grounds crew nickname. you will be known by that nickname in every way except, of course, your paycheck and employee records.}
<A>__{the colonel looks over his paperwork.}
<C>__{the colonel }
<D>__{let's see, what do we have? hmm...yes. ok, first up is eddie cochran. your grounds crew nickname will be.....eddie!}
<A>__{eddie smiles knowingly. this has been his grounds crew nickname for the last 8 years, mostly because he would never answer to anything else, and the colonel gave up trying.}
<C>__{the colonel }
<D>__{now crewmembers, listen up. eddie here has eight years experience on the grounds crew. why, i'd like to think there isn't anything, any situation that eddie hasn't faced. listen to him. learn from him. watch what he does. this man is the finest, most conscientious grounds crewman we've ever had.}
<A>__{eddie is beaming with pride now. the colonel pulls a brand new toilet plunger from the cart nearby and hands it to eddie. eddie shoulders it as if it were a rifle. the colonel walks down the line.}
<C>__{the colonel }
<D>__{let's see...clark? hmmm. your grounds crew nickname will be....sparky.}
<A>__{it is all robbie can do not to laugh. the colonel goes on to the next kid, skeeter who is tall, skinny and goofy looking. skeeter's eyes are faced forward, but something catches them. his eyes follow an unseen object as we begin to hear a small mosquito. finally his eyes follow it until he looks, cross eyed at his own nose. the colonel has taken note of this and is following it too. skeeter can take no more, and brushes it off his nose as he makes a face.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{sorry, sir. mosquito.}
<C>__{the colonel}
<D>__{hmmm.....your grounds crew nickname will be.....skeeter.}
<A>__{the colonel steps over the cart and gets another new plunger and hands it to skeeter who follows eddie's lead. next in line is a short, chubby lad, snitch. as the colonel approaches him, a quick sound of passing gas is heard. the colonel is startled, and snitch makes a quick finger motion indicating the culprit is skeeter, next to him.}
<C>__{the colonel }
<P>__{(looking at the clipboard)}
<D>__{bradley, is it? ok, mr. bradley.....your grounds crew nickname will be snitch.}
<A>__{snitch shows his dismay with a frown. the colonel has run out of new plungers already and is forced to move to one of last year's leftovers, which look somewhat depressing. he gets one and give it to snitch, who looks at it, makes a face, and decides not to shoulder it. robbie is so depressed he looks like he's about to pass out. his worst fears have been realized. his summer is passing before his eyes. there's only one more person, a young 14 year old girl, to go before robbie. the colonel addresses her.}
<C>__{the colonel }
<D>__{melinda tally. hmmm... your grounds crew nickname will be...}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<A>__{suddenly alex bursts onto the scene, and even he, at this point, is somewhat out of breath.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{hello, colonel!}
<C>__{the colonel}
<P>__{(thinking, staring)}
<D>__{alex, isn't it?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{yes sir, colonel. and what a fine staff you've assembled this year. have you told them yet about your army background?}
<C>__{the colonel}
<D>__{well, no, i didn't think it was..}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(interrupting, to the grounds kids)}
<D>__{the colonel here is very modest. did you know that he reorganized the entire process of cleaning and sanitizing an army barracks and its latrines?}
<C>__{the colonel}
<D>__{well, it really wasn't much of a...}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(interrupting again)}
<D>__{wasn't much?}
<P>__{(again, to grounds kids)}
<D>__{can you just imagine for a moment the germs and bacteria our american soldiers could pick up in an unsanitised army latrine? it's impossible to determine just how many lives have been saved thanks to the efforts of this one humble army colonel.}
<C>__{the colonel}
<D>__{well, i suppose when you put it that way...}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(to the grounds kids)}
<D>__{i, too, came up through the ranks when at age 14, i began my service here at water world learning from this great man.}
<C>__{the colonel}
<D>__{yes....i remember now.....what was your grounds nickname...?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{not even sure i remember it myself, sir. but i remember much more. did you tell them about the film?}
<C>__{the colonel}
<D>__{film?}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(to the colonel)}
<D>__{"hygiene makes you happy"}
<P>__{(to the grounds kids)}
<D>__{every enlisted man in the army has seen it. some by choice. all from the mind of the colonel here...}
<C>__{the colonel}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{i never forget a grounds nickname....}
<A>__{aokee has finally made it now, but is, of course, out of breath again.}
<C>__{the colonel }
<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{aokee, good god, man...are you ok?}
<A>__{aokee gestures he is fine, and does a combination of charades and hawaiian pantomime before he finally speaks.}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{colonel....terrible mistake...}
<A>__{alex gets behind aokee, deciding he needs some help, feeding him words.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(quietly behind aokee)}
<D>__{bureaucratic bumble...}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{bureaucratic bumble....}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{lost paperwork....}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{lost paperwork....}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{an error in the front office...}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{error in front office....}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{spiced applesauce....}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{spiced...}
<A>__{aokee stops, turn and glares at alex, who merely smiles and shrugs.}
<C>__{the colonel}
<D>__{good god, man, what are you trying to say?}
<A>__{alex comes around from behind aokee.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it's robbie sir. he was supposed to work at aokee's and through some crazy mix up, he ended up here.}
<C>__{the colonel}
<P>__{(looking at clipboard)}
<D>__{zirpollo? well this is highly irregular...}
<A>__{he is flipping though the papers, confused.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(can't pass this up)}
<D>__{most annoying....}
<C>__{the colonel}
<D>__{most annoying....}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{never happened before....}
<C>__{the colonel}
<D>__{never happened before....}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{spaghetti marinara...}
<C>__{the colonel}
<D>__{spa....what?}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{well, if he was supposed to be assigned to you, we'll just have to let him go...}
<A>__{robbie has caught on and is quick to step out of line, and pick up his shirt to be ready to go.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(to the colonel)}
<D>__{i was confused myself, sir. i had heard i was working for some hawaiian guy.}
<C>__{aokee}
<P>__{(reassuring)}
<D>__{i promise, we go straight to personnel, straighten the whole thing out. you won't need to worry.}
<C>__{the colonel}
<D>__{very well. we'll just have to make do.}
<A>__{the colonel goes back to the girl melinda he was about to nickname before the interruption, but is staring after alex, aokee and robbie as they walk off. he looks at melinda. he looks back at alex & company. it hits him.}
<C>__{the colonel }
<P>__{(remembering)}
<D>__{snafu.}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{the colonel}
<D>__{his grounds crew nickname. i remember it now. snafu.}
