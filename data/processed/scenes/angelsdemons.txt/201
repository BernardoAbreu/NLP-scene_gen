<L>__{int rocher's office night}
<A>__{bandaged now, langdon and vittoria are ushered into rocher's office by a swiss guardsman.}
<C>__{swiss guardsman}
<D>__{please wait here while we arrange your transportation. may i get you anything?}
<A>__{they shake their heads, no thanks. settle into chairs to the side of rocher's desk. they look uncomfortable it's weird to be in a dead man's office. vittoria looks at his desk. thinks of something. she gets up and goes to it, running her hand lightly over it.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{leonardo's journals. i want them back.}
<A>__{she feels in the surface of the desk and finds the square outline of the inlaid panel where rocher hid the journals. she tries prying it open, but that doesn't work, she tries pushing down on the front of it and the panel slowly rotates open. the journals, which were laid on top of the television monitor, slide out and onto the desk. vittoria scoops them up and is about to close the panel again when }
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{wait a minute.}
<A>__{he looks down at the monitor. thinking. at its odd, key shaped on off switch. he pulls something from his pocket the key rocher gave him, just as he died. in langdon's mind, he sees rocher's face, looking up at him, dying:}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{for safety.}
<A>__{back in the office, langdon looks at the key, and its odd shape. looks down at the monitor, the same odd shape where its switch should be. in langdon's mind, they're back in the pope's office, but rocher is alive, and saying words he said earlier:}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{the holy father was subject to seizures... but he took steps.}
<A>__{back in the office, rocher's voice continues over, but langdon mouths the words as he remembers them:}
<C>__{rocher's voice }
<D>__{"made sure he was watched."}
<A>__{in langdon's mind, rocher is back in the office again, finishing his sentence:}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{for safety.}
<A>__{in rocher's office, langdon holds the key up, repeating those last words:}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{for safety.}
<A>__{he lowers the key to the monitor, extending it toward the keyhole and it's a perfect fit. he twists it. and with a zzzzt of power, the monitor winks to life. an image comes into focus.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{where's that?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{that...is the papal office.}
<A>__{on the monitor, they are indeed looking at an image of the pope's office. there are two dead bodies on the floor, covered with sheets, and vatican police are photographing everything. must be live. in rocher's office, langdon's figuring it out.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{the pope spent a lot of time in contemplation, alone. if he was worried about seizures, he must have asked rocher to install a camera without telling anyone. to keep an eye on him. for safety. and maybe }
<A>__{he reaches down to the screen, toward a touch panel at the bottom. you don't have to be a symbologist to understand these symbols play, pause, fast forward. and rewind. langdon touches it. on the monitor, the image zips backwards, rapidly, to the shooting, and the all the way back to when rocher and the camerlengo were alone together. rocher stands just behind him, the camerlengo still kneels before the fireplace. as the image starts to play forward, in real time, we go in close on the monitor and come out }
