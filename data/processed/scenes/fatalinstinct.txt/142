<C>__{lola}
<D>__{then let's get to the point!}
<A>__{lola charges! ned rolls onto his back, jamming both feet into her stomach, heaving her up over him... thru the air! she slams into the wall!... then slowly turns... still cool and collected. she raises a cigarette... lights it with the ice pick "lighter."}

"sister!" he reaches a boiling point, raising two fingers, preparing to give her the three stooges "two fingered eye poke." she blocks it with her hand and shoves him away. then, she executes a perfect three stooges "wiggly hand head slap", telling him...}
<C>__{lola}
