<L>__{interior bathroom night flashback}
<A>__{rae enters the dark bathroom and shuts the door behind her. her hair is shorter, a shaggy bob, bleached platinum blond. arty, always behind the door, attempts to enter, but rae pushes the door closed and locks it.}
<C>__{arty}
<D>__{baby, where you goin'?}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{i'm gonna pee. i gotta take a break and go pee.}
<C>__{arty}
<D>__{now, this isn't fair. you said i could do it, too.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{eat shit and die, arty. a girl can change her fuckin' mind.}
<A>__{rae finds the light switch. she yelps upon seeing ronnie crouched by the tub. suddenly feeling violated rae yanks down on her shirt to hide the fact that she's not wearing anything else.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{you don't gotta get up but... i gotta go...}
<A>__{ronnie attempts to get up but it's too late, rae has already squatted on the commode, pinning ronnie between her and the bathtub. rae is breathing heavy, her focus is scattered. she's coming up or coming down from a big burn.}
<C>__{rae}
<P>__{(waiting for pee)}
<D>__{i think if i just piss... i will be okay.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you feelin' sick?}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{i'm just in one of my moods. you know how i get.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yeah, i know.}
<A>__{ronnie tries to look away, trying to make an awkward moment less awkward. rae's anxiety is hitting her.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{i think it'd be better if you talk to me.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{just about anything, you know. it can be funny or... not. just tell me somethin'.}
<A>__{ronnie nervously considers this before agreeing to open his mouth. he points into the tub.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{well. that's my vomit. i came in here to get sick. i thought i'd make the toilet but... anyway, i got sick.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{are you wasted?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{no. i just got a messed up stomach.}
<C>__{rae}
<P>__{(remembering)}
<D>__{holy shit!}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{holy shit, ronnie!}
<P>__{(smacks him on the arm)}
<D>__{you're a fuckin' rock star.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm a what?}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{all them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! shit! that arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...}
<A>__{ronnie leans over and dry heaves into the tub. it is painful. rae leans forward and touches his back, comforting him.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{hey? you okay, ronnie?}
<A>__{ronnie falls back, gripping his stomach, there are tears in his eyes from the dry heaving. suddenly emotion hits him.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(through tears and clenched teeth)}
<D>__{box of cereal... well, goddamn...}
<P>__{(looks at his trembling fists)}
<D>__{everybody keeps sayin' things to me take make me feel great. but i don't feel great at all. i feel like i'm comin' outta my skin. like i'm losin' control of my mind.}
<P>__{(looks into rae's eyes)}
<D>__{i'm not like this. i'm not usually so... afraid.}
<P>__{(really starts crying)}
<D>__{i don't know what's... wrong...}
<A>__{rae pulls ronnie to her. he cries into her shoulder. she gently rubs his wet face and sings her words of comfort.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{is'okay... is'okay...}
<A>__{ronnie begins to calm down. the sobbing abates. the metal music from the party outside is muffled through the door. the two hold onto each other in silence. rae pees. they both giggle, a welcome release of tension.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{i feel better. do you?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yeah, i do.}
