<A>__{helen closes the manuscript and lays it carefully by the side of the projector. she turns to leave then looks curiously at the projector. close shot of helen hesitating. like a small girl in front of her mother's make up box, she touches the projector tentatively, hesitates again, then presses a switch. a beam of light shoots out. we watch helen's face as she looks at the screen. nothing seems wrong for a few seconds then something starts to happen to the comers of her mouth... and then her eyes become locked... and cannot stop watching. some kind of sound comes from the back of her throat. her hands dig into the table and she tries to stand up. she cannot manage it the first time and keeps on watching, then, like a child waking from a nightmare, she jerks herself away from the table, and stumbles towards the door. close shot of mark standing there watching her. close shot of helen staring at him... again we hear that sound from the back of her throat. he looks away from her at once.}

<C>__{mark}
<D>__{made them see their own terror as the spike went in... and if death has a face, they saw that too!}

<P>__{(he presses a master switch on the wait)}

<A>__{slowly he walks past his cameras. as he does, the metallic disc on each one explodes with a little plop and the eye of each camera winks once as if in salute. some go off with flashlights on either side of the room. the sound of footsteps hurrying up the stairs. ahead of mark coming steadily closer are the spikes of the tripod. the mirror on the cine camera reflects the approach and helen's terrified face.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{no no!}
<A>__{the child's screaming reaches its peak as mark approaches the spikes... ahead of him, on the small table where his projector stands, is helen's book the magic camera.}
