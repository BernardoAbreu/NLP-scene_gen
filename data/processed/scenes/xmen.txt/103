<L>__{interior laboratory night}
<A>__{beast looks at his watch. itis stopped. he puts it to his ear shakes it. then his ears perk up. he hears something. he glances at the wall. all things metal picture frames, chairs, objects on tables, etc. start to move one after the other. it is as if some magnetic force is moving past the wall, just outside the lab, heading for the open door. beast, sensing the danger, makes a run for the metal door. just as he reaches it, it slams closed knocking him back across the room. beast crashes into the wall on the opposite side of the lab. his leg badly hurt, beast tries to crawl toward the door. but as he does this, metal objects from around the lab fly in front of it sealing him in.}
