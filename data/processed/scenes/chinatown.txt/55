<A>__{gittes hurries over to the packard. he gets down on the driveway, lying on his back, bracing himself. with the heel of his shoe, he kicks at the right rear taillight of the car. he shatters the red lens, gets up. he carefully pulls the red lens off the taillight, exposing the white light beneath it. he tosses the red lens into the shrubbery and hurries back toward the house.}

<A>__{gittes can see the servant again. evelyn is pacing back and forth in and out of his line of vision. after a moment someone rises into shot, obviously from lying on a bed. the figure is just a few feet from evelyn. her tear stained face comes}
