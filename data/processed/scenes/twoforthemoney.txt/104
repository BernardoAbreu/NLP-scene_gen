<L>__{100 fucking percent!}
<A>__{champagne corks start popping. someone hits the remote and the wall of screens fill with a jamming mtv video. the lights dim. people start dancing. cell phones start ringing and various salesmen into phones call back tomorrow! who knows who he likes next week you fucking degenerate! i don't have anything yet! the young salesman who made the monday night and over under picks talks excitedly to southie and reggie.}
<C>__{young salesman}
<A>__{he kinda mesmerized me, see, and like spock or something i visualized seattle and the over and he wrote it down! said picking me was the same as him doing it.}
<C>__{southie}
<A>__{what kinda power is that?}
<C>__{reggie}
<A>__{who fucking cares? he's money. jerry sykes stands nearby, listening. whoops of excitement as walter jumps up on his desk, starts throwing cash. jerry moves through the raucous crowd, finds brandon against a wall, out of the fray, watching walter hurl money in the air.}
<C>__{jerry}
<A>__{congratulations, brandon... or should i say john? either way it's amazing. i must say i am impressed. letting salesmen make your picks? that's balls.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{(watching walter hurl money) best get in there and collect some of this, jerry. the way you're picking, you're gonna need some for a rainy day.}
<C>__{jerry}
<A>__{keep talking, sugarmouth. must feel pretty good to be that plugged in. you got a good streak going. well enjoy it while it lasts. the gambling gods are a fickle bunch, sooooo easily offended. brandon makes his way through the room, reaches walter.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{here, get you teeth fixed. there might be some other businesses you can make two mill in one weekend, but tell me, someone please tell me where else are you gonna have this much fun?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{how much of that big stack's mine?}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{a one with five zeros behind it.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{...a 100 fucking thou? on two million?}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{you're working out of my shop.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{i was thinking of ten percent.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{really? is that what you were thinking?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{i got you novian.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{nice job, now don't blow it by getting ahead of yourself. i'm looking beyond the money.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{you can afford to, you're holding it all. c'mon, i only want what's fair, walter. walter smiles. wraps an arm around. puts him in a headlock.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{"fair?" honey, you don't know what fair is. what's fair is not giving you the money. now i'm only gonna say this once. if you want something from me more than a gazunheidt after a sneeze you have to do more than think about it. or ask for it. you gotta earn it. you gotta fight for it. you gotta rip it out of my fucking talons. john anthony would know that. that's what he'd do. as a matter of fact, next time you come with that shit, come as john anthony. 'cause from now on i'm not talking to you about money. brandon pulls free. stunned. seething. mtv pounds from the tvs, people dancing all around. toni walks up.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{the big winner. how are you doing?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{i'm winning... i'm winning... brandon leaves. walter pulls her close, moves with the music.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{dance with me. close, that's it. i gotta dance with you more. listen, i'm thinking of buying a plane. big one. g something. we can just get on it and go, you and me, anywhere in the world, any time we want. there's a house for sale in the bahamas with a runway right beside it. comes with its own 50 foot boat. two for one. what an investment. anything happens, you and jules always have it. let's go down and check it out. next week, just us, barefoot in the sand. (toni watching him) well say something.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{... are you gambling again, walter?}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{what? oh, c'mon hell no.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{look me in the eye and say it.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{i am not gambling. not now, not ever. 18 years clean. that shit's over.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{it's never over, walter. you know that.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{get a lie detector if you don't believe me. shoot me with truth serum. baby we just made two million dollars. i'm working miracles here. now can i enjoy a dance with my wife? huh? i swear, it's a shame you can't drink, we need something to kill that bug up your ass. toni smiles. walter holds her close, kisses her and }
