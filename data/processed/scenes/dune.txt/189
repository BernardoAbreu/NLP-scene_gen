<A>__{the baron is flying wildly, circling the outside of a large steel shower, while nefud and a dwarf play a strange instrument producing maniacal, perverse, screaming music. the baron sees rabban enter, but continues to fly around the shower.}

<D>__{rabban!!... we're knee deep in atreides blood! we've gutted them. we've gutted them!}
<P>__{(laughs)}

<C>__{baron}
<D>__{rabban, rabban... i place you in charge of arrakis. it's yours to squeeze, as i promised. i want you to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze.}
<P>__{(massaging in rhythm)}
<D>__{give me spice! drive them into utter submission. you must not show the slightest pity or mercy... as only you can... never stop!}
<P>__{(releasing him)}
<D>__{go.... show no mercy!}
<C>__{rabban}
<D>__{yes, my lord baron.}
<A>__{rabban leaves just as feyd steps out of the shower. the baron turns to him lovingly. }
<C>__{baron}
