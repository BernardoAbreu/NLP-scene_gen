<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{i feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.}
<C>__{cheeba}
<D>__{dela what's the matter with you.}
<C>__{mantan}
<D>__{you ain't happy about the green light?}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{people show their happiness in a lot of different ways.}
<C>__{mantan}
<D>__{well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{i'm happy for all of us. it's just we have a great responsibility now. the pressure is on.}
<C>__{mantan}
<D>__{pressure? dela, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. sheeett!!! this is lightstuff. now when you scramblin' out on the street in da january winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with no money and no prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{i didn't mean it to sound like that.}
<C>__{mantan}
<D>__{that's the way it came out. let me ask you one question. have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{now i'm privileged?! why? because i didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare? because i didn't call home a cardboard box? no, i never ever went to bed hungry and i'm proud of it, too. whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.}
<C>__{mantan}
<D>__{the point i'm trying to make is that this is a blessing. it's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.}

<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{what is your problem?}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{my problem is mantan the new millenium minstrel show.}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{it was the principle. dunwitty had to be enlightened. i was making a pointerior i take pride in my work. plus, i already told you i wasn't gonna walk away from my money.}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{fuck da money. why do through all this effort? why? are you looking for love from dunwitty? for respect? dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you. so now what are you gonna do?}
<A>__{someone begins to pound on the bathroom door.}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{will you please let me in? i have to use the toilet.}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{you're gonna have to hold it in because we're not finished yet...}
<A>__{she returns her attention to delacroix.}
<C>__{sloan }
<D>__{...quit then.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{even if money wasn't an issue, dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{what's the chances of mantan being picked up?}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{i wouldn't bet against it. my negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{like i said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal. dunwitty, he just tolerates your negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.}
<A>__{the banging starts again.}
<C>__{manager's voice }
<D>__{please open this bathroom door immediately. you are being very inconsiderate.}
<A>__{sloan unlocks the door and they exit.}

<L>__{interior dunwitty's office morning}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{i strongly feel that a negro should direct this. this kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. one misstep and we're doing "amos and andy." only a negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{to hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right. it's un american. i will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{i was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{i want a hot, young white director. maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy madonna video.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{you're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{i just want you to meet him. keep an open mind.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{besides, what does he know about negroes?}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective. a black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter? with this kid, the possibilities are endless.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{what are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky madonna video?}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{if spielburg can direct "the color purple" and "amistad", our whiz kid can direct the mantan pilot.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{that's exactly my pointerior has he even directed actors before in anything?}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{no!!! just meet the guy. that's all i'm asking. look, i will even let you choose your own musical director. you can have that.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{in the immortal words of derrick coleman, whooopdeedamndoo!!!}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{derrick coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas d.c. didn't want it bad enough. delacroix, do you want it? bad enough to kill for it? do you want it that much.}

<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{i've never worked with any of you and you've never worked with me so we'll be starting from scratch. i'm a fair person, a straight shooter and i don't hold my tongue. everybody up in here should know i had nothing to do with you being hired.}
<C>__{delacroix }
<D>__{i would have preferred at least one other negro writer. any questions? comments?}
<A>__{mona raises her hand.}
<C>__{delacroix }
<D>__{yes, your name?}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{he, i'm mona.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{hi, mona.}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{i perfectly understand where you're coming from. as a minority i can relate to your struggle also. but i think you should give us all a chance. we want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{oh, is that what i'm doing?}
<A>__{beth jumps in.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i think because of our background we can bring a unique perspective to mantan.}
<A>__{seth pipes in also.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{a fresh pair of eyes. a new look, insight, new angle that hasn't been seen before.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{i've heard this somewhere before.}
<A>__{david raises his hand.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{my name is david. i do think it would be better to have some african american writers but for whatever reason they are not here. i don't know if they couldn't find any people with experience, they wouldn't work for the pay or refused to work for the show. i don't know and nobody in this room probably knows either. i'm looking at this as a unique opportunity. we all should. i'm a damn good writer and i'm ready to go to work.}
<A>__{everyone in the room applauds. sloan looks at delacroix.}
<B>__{freeze frame}
<C>__{delacroix }
<D>__{this thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in. could don king be near? good thing sloan had my back. she's my rock. this was going to be a whole lot of work.}
<A>__{un freeze frame}
<C>__{delacroix }
<D>__{david, i appreciate your comments. anybody got an ideas? everybody just talk out loud.}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{i've always liked the format of rowan and martin's "laugh in."}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{that could be cool.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{what about something like "the jeffersons?" i grew up in idaho so that's how i got my understanding of black people. through sherman helmsley, louissee!!!.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{"good times" was better. kid dy no mite!!!}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{you pole are going to far back for me. i think we have to go after a hipper feel. like the stuff eddie murphy used to do on "saturday night live."}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{or martin. you go girl.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{what about the black exploitation films? no one has ever tried making that work on tv.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{and for reason. have you ever seen "scream blacula, scream?"}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{i think, and delacroix will agree with me, the politics of this show have to be right. we should always be laughing with our characters, not at them.}
<B>__{close on}
<A>__{delacroix, as the writers continue to ramble on, he lets them jerk off.}
<C>__{delacroix }
<D>__{the mission was accomplished. all of these people left the room thinking they would have real input. i was writing this pilot alone, myself, me.}
<L>__{exterior street day}

<A>__{we dolly past the hundreds and hundreds of unemployed african american actors, many of them dressed in various costumes.}

<A>__{we see singers, magicians, dancers, acrobats, comedians, rappers. some good, most are terrible. many come out on stage dressed like mammies, stepin' fetchit, slaves, pimps, ho's, hustlers, and basketball players. it is a cavalcade of all the stereotypical roles one has seen.}
<B>__{angle on}
<A>__{space. lulu, a spoken word artist, goes her rendition of "way down on the swanee river."}
