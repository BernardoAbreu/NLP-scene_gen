<L>__{interior juliette's. night}
<A>__{a singer in the julie london mould is singing `i'm in the mood for love' while cigarette girls and glamorous waitresses patrol the tables. jenny is sitting with the others at a table in the club, eating and talking. she looks about twelve, but she's thrilled to be there. we know now that her life can never be the same again, and there will be no going back to fish paste sandwiches with spotty graham.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{have you never heard "chante francoise sagan"?}
<A>__{jenny shakes her head. her eyes are wide she's clearly awe struck. david offers her a cigarette a gitane which she takes. he lights it for her while she's listening.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{oh, it's wonderful.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i've only got....well, i think it's just called `juliette greco'. the one with the eyes on the sleeve. i saved up and got my french conversation teacher to bring it back after christmas.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you've got a french conversation teacher?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{is that why you suddenly speak french for no reason?}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(ignoring her)}
<D>__{you must have seen her sing?}
<A>__{jenny shakes her head again and smiles. where would she have seen juliette greco? danny, meanwhile, is baffled. who hasn't seen juliette greco?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{she's marvellous.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{but you should see her in paris, not here. david will take you.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'd love to. you'd fit right in.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(sympathetically)}
<D>__{better than here, really.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's wonderful to find a young person who wants to know things. there's so much i want you to see.}
<A>__{they sip their drinks pensively, possibly to allow time for the double entendre to disappear into the smoke.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{are you still all right to come and have a look at that pembroke villas place with me on friday, danny?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{oh. no. can't do it. there's a burne jones coming up at christie's on friday. and i want it.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(laughing in disbelief)}
<D>__{you're thinking of buying a burne jones? a real one?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i just have a feeling that the pre raphaelites are going to take off.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i love the pre raphaelites.}
<C>__{david}

<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{yes, of course. rossetti and burne jones, anyway. not holman hunt, so much. he's so garish.}
<A>__{danny looks at her. there's clearly more to this schoolgirl than he thought.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{absolutely! why don't we all go to the auction? wouldn't that be fun?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{an auction. gosh. how exciting.}
