<A>__{old miss hibbs is lecturing on moby dick. the kids are dozing.}
<C>__{miss hibbs}
<D>__{then a cry from the crow's nest... "thar she blows!"}
<A>__{suddenly, a screaming elvis slides into the open door on his stomach and bowls miss hibbs over like a brunswick. he clamors to his feet and shoots out the room leaving everyone stunned.}
<L>__{interior hallway day}
<A>__{pausing at the corner, elvis takes a breath and leaps around it. he smiles at what he sees. up ahead, hawk, lex, and trip stand on a 3 stair stoop, desperately pulling at a locked door. elvis smiles. they}

<D>__{looking for something, rodents?}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{yeah, elvis...}

<D>__{on your marks and...}
<A>__{trip and lex ready themselves, then...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{fire!}
<A>__{they start stomping on the packets, squirting elvis's face and torso with tomato based condiment causing him to let out a scream that lasts the rest of the scene. ketchup spatters across his body in super slow motion. a shot hits him in the mouth and he coughs it back out in mid scream. the boys stomp relentlessly, mercilessly, blasting their nemesis with hideous cafeteria red as elvis throws his arms back, body quaking at every splat. it's kind of like the scene in "the godfather" where sonny gets it. beaten and spent, his scream now dried up to a hoarse gasping, elvis slips on some ketchup at his feet. he hits the floor with a thud right in the goop. he lays there letting out dry sobs looking like a bunless wiener. hawk jumps off the stoop. taking elvis's key chain away, he hops back up and unlocks the door letting trip and lex out. hawk whips the keys back at elvis, hitting him in the head, then flashes a pearly error flynn smile.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{elvis, you ain't nothin' but a hot dog.}
<A>__{hawk bolts out the door. elvis tries to get up only to slip in the muck again and fall back down twice as hard.}
