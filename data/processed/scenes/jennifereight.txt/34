<L>__{33: interior apartment. institute. day.}
<A>__{claustrophobia evaporates instantly. great views down the val ley from every window. plus a bizarre jumble of furniture and colors. but no pictures on the walls. no friendly photographs. nor any lights. although the afternoon is shutting down there isn't a light in the room. ross elects to stay at the windows. berlin takes an offered chair. helena sits nervously opposite.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{what d'you wanna ask, mr ross?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i'm mr berlin. mr ross is right here. and mr ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's ok.?}
<P>__{(she nods)}
<D>__{ok. .. i'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with amber on the aft ernoon she left? take your time, and nothing's too trivial, ok.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{well, i think i told you on the phone .. i went up to her room to say good bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{what kind of friend? was he a boy friend? an old friend? new friend?}
<A>__{lots of headshake. and lots of silences. "i really don't know."}
<D>__{that's ok. can you give me any idea what this fellow was like?}
<P>__{(headshake)}
<D>__{well, d'you know how old he was?}
<P>__{(headshake)}
<D>__{alright, let me put it this way? how old d'you think i am? twenty six? thirty nine? or fifty three?}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{fifty three.}
<A>__{possibly the only grin ross is going to get out of this place.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{you must have some idea about him.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{when we spoke on the phone, did you know i was blonde?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{why not? you heard my voice?}
<A>__{a good pointerior and a point taken. and berlin might even say so.}
<D>__{we don't have some kind of sixth sense, you know. ex cept in ridiculous novels ..}
<A>__{now another silence overtaken by a low whistle in another room.}
<D>__{he used a breath freshener ...}
<A>__{a sardonic headshake from ross. well that solves the case then!}
<D>__{and i think his name was john?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{john? .. you never said that on the phone? .. what makes you think his name was john?}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{i don't know. i guess she must have called him john? i'm mak ing tea. would you like some?}
<A>__{berlin would but ross wouldn't. she leaves and whispers begin.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{this looks promising .. i think this one could be it?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{thank christ we got a witness.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{let me just keep going a while. she might remember something?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{what? she's blind, bro. you may as well ask one of these beethoven guys on the piano?}
<A>__{he thumbs a cluster of cheap busts of composers on an upright.}
<D>__{we're better off having another pop at old abe lincoln down the re? get angry with the prick. get some of his "useful visions" in? someone must have seen something?}
<A>__{negative from berlin. checked it out. sunday and no one about.}
<D>__{this is fucken crazy. two hours here, two hours back, and the only word i've written is john ..}
<A>__{a touch later and the sun is setting. ross stands at a window to watch it go. watches one or two cars driving away. watches a bird sitting outside on the fire escape. berlin's voice can just about be heard off screen "you said he spoke? can you re member what he said?" ross saunters back into helena's answer.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{well, he just said, come on, hurry up, will you, because it's starting to snow again.}
<A>__{empty teacups and empty notebook. ross sits opposite berlin.}
<D>__{and i remember, he was a lit tle breathless from carrying the cases because the elevat or had gone out that weekend.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{the elevator wasn't working?}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{no, it has a mind of its own.}
<A>__{a clock strikes four somewhere. and berlin knows he's lost it.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{can i see your hands?}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{my hands?}
<A>__{he takes her hands and helena immediately looks uncomfortable. he examines scars and she stares at him with her useless eyes.}
<D>__{i have a class. i have to go.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{is there anything else you can tell me? anything about him or her? doesn't matter how small?}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{no. except he smoked. like you.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{me?}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{yes, i could smell it on his breath, like i can on your's.}
<A>__{a taut instant between ross and berlin. berlin caught out and he knows it. ross roars in silence "you lying pig" and writes in his notebook. the angle switches to see "berlin is a liar."}
<D>__{i'm late .. i really have to go ..}
<A>__{everyone suddenly on their feet and helena gets into a jacket.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{d'you have a dog? seeing eye dog?}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{lotta scratch marks on your door?}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{sometimes i look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{could i just refer you to this memo here, sergeant?}
<A>__{he tries to get his notebook under berlin's nose. but berlin isn't looking or listening but following helena into her hall.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{did amber have a dog?}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{what color was it?}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{she opens the door and ross is barely through before it slams.}
