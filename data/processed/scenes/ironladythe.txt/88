<C>__{heseltine}
<D>__{i know you're running late margaret, but we have to address this situation in light of tomorrow's blistering press coverage. blistering! the knives are out. your draft budget's been leaked, geoffrey, they are baying for our blood!}
<C>__{howe}

<A>__{the scratch of prior's hand on unkempt hair }
<C>__{heseltine}
<D>__{no one is saying we have to buckle.}
<C>__{prior}
<D>__{but is this really the time to make these spending cuts in the middle of one of the deepest recessions this country has ever experienced?}
<C>__{hestletine}
<D>__{we need a plan of action, margaret.}
<C>__{pym}
<D>__{absolutely. a strategy.}
<C>__{gilmour}
<D>__{we must be armed.}
<C>__{prior}
<D>__{agreed.}
<A>__{margaret stiffens, the needle momentarily hovering mid stitch as margaret shifts a little the seamstress resumes sewing }
<C>__{prior }
<D>__{there's a perception, margaret rightly or wrongly, that we are now completely out of touch with the country.}
<A>__{the patronizing tone inflames her.}

<A>__{gilmour makes a gesture.}
<C>__{gilmour}
<D>__{nothing. nothing, prime minister.}
<A>__{margaret is furious.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{don't try to hide you opinions. goodness me, i'd much rather you were honest and straightforward about them instead of continuously and damagingly leaking them to the press. well?}
<A>__{momentarily silent margaret's eyes travel around the room in waiting }
<C>__{pym}
<D>__{well, people can't pay their mortgages.}
<C>__{gilmour}

<C>__{pym}
<D>__{honest, hard working, decent people are losing their homes. it's terribly shameful.}
<C>__{gilmour}
<D>__{the point is, prime minister, that we must moderate the pace }
<C>__{heseltine}
<D>__{ if we're even to have a hope of winning the next election }
<C>__{pym}
<D>__{quite right.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{ah. worried about our careers, are we?}
<A>__{they make noises to the effect that nothing could be further from the truth. but margaret has their measure.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{gentlemen, if we don't cut spending we will be bankrupt. yes the medicine is harsh but the patient requires it in order to live. shall we withhold the medicine? no! we are not wrong. we did not seek election and win in order to manage the decline of a great nation.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{the people of this country chose us because they believe we can restore the health of the british economy and we will do just that! barring a failure of nerve.}

<A>__{margaret straightens her cuff, testing the button, as the meeting slowly disbands and the ministers move away.}
<C>__{howe}
<D>__{you can't close down a discussion because it's not what you wish to hear.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{i don't expect everyone just to sit there and agree with me. but what kind of leader am i if i don't try to get my own way to do what i know to be right.}
<C>__{howe}
<D>__{yes. but margaret, one must be careful of testing one's colleagues' loyalty too far.}
<A>__{margaret glances up watching the ministers disappearing, in whispered conversation, like conspirators. (archive footage) rioting in brixton, burning cars, huge civil unrest }
<C>__{tv journalist }
