<A>__{as jack and ramirez walk toward the cemetery, we see ramirez who wears a lightweight white parka so that he shivers in the cold in contrast to jack's heavy winter gear. ramirez carries what appears to be a gun.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you need to not only remember the names on every tombstone, but where they are so when i call out a name, you whirl and shoot.}
<A>__{they walk into a scene that is completely surreal. standing behind every tombstone is one of the crew of trainers. each man wears a white parka and white pants against the freezing cold. in the center of their impromptu circle stands ramirez, also wearing white, but of much lighter material so that he shivers in the cold. all of them including ramirez hold paint pellet guns. it is a cemetery full of living targets which can shoot back. jack stands outside the circle.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{it's kind of cold. you think i might be able to borrow a warmer jacket from someone?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{brisson! we don't want you to be comfortable. that's just what will get you killed.}
<A>__{ramirez hesitates a moment, trying to remember where the tombstone with the name "brisson" is. the trainer who stands behind the "brisson" tombstone has no such hesitation. he fires at ramirez and an ugly black splotch of paint explodes on ramirez's white suit. ramirez shakes his head in frustration.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{dupres! paquet!}
<A>__{ramirez whirls, misses one, is hit again with another black splotch but hits the paquet tombstone square in the chest with a black splotch of his own.}
