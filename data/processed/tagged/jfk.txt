<A>__{there is no real fight, but the police, as if pre alerted, arrive. arrests are made. we see oswald in a room in the police station, talking with fbi agent john quigley. a calendar on the wall shows that it's august, 1963.}

<D>__{there was no real fight and the arresting lieutenant later said he felt it was a staged incident. in jail, oswald asked to talk to special agent john quigley of the fbi who showed up immediately. they have a private session. oswald is released and quigley destroys his notes from the interview.}

<D>__{bill, lou, we're standing in the heart of the united states government's intelligence community in new orleans. that's the fbi there, the cia, secret service, oni. doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a communist to spend his spare time?}

<D>__{what are you driving at, boss?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{we're going back into the case, lou the murder of the president. i want you to take some money from the fees and fines account and go to dallas talk to some people. bill, i want you to get oser on the medical, the autopsy, susan on oswald and ruby histories, tax records...}

<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you're not under cross examination here, jack.}
<A>__{what i need is a little clarification about the night guy banister beat you over the head with his magnum. you called our office hopping mad from your hospital bed. don't tell me you don't remember that? jack looks away and doesn't respond.}

<D>__{here's my problem, jack. you told me you and guy were good friends for a long time?}

<C>__{martin}
<D>__{never touched me.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{yet on november 22, 1963 the day of the president's murder our police report says he pistol whipped you with a .357 magnum.}
<P>__{(martin's eyes are fixed on jim)}
<D>__{but the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill. here, take a look at it.}
<P>__{(martin looks at the report)}
<D>__{now, does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you?}
<A>__{sudden flashback to the night of the pistol whipping. the camera shows banister laying martin's head open the beating the humiliation.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(shaking his head slowly, dreamily)}
<D>__{no, it involved more than that.}
<A>__{bill looks at jim.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{how much more?}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(waits)}
<D>__{i don't know if i should talk about this.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{well, i'd ask guy we were friendly, you know heart attack, wasn't it?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{if you buy what you read in the paper.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you have other information?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i didn't say that. all i know is he died suddenly just before the warren report came out.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{why did guy beat you, jack?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{well, i guess now that guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer. i wasn't really part of the operation, you know. i was handling the private eye work for guy when that came in not much did but that's why i was there... it was a nuthouse. there were all these cubans coming and going. they all looked alike to me.}
<A>__{flashback to banister's office in 1963. there are cubans in battle fatigues and combat boots; duffle bags are lying around. david ferrie, in fatigues, directs the cubans as they carry crates of ammunition and weapons into a back room. martin observes from another desk.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{dave ferrie you know about him?}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{was he there often?}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{often? he practically lived there. it was real cloak and dagger stuff. they called it operation mongoose. the idea was to train all these cuban exiles for another invasion of cuba. banister's office was part of a supply line that ran from dallas, through new orleans to miami, stockpiling arms and explosives.}
<A>__{still in 1963, we see the exterior of banister's office. a dozen cubans follow ferrie downstairs into the street, and pile into several cars, duffels thrown in with them. ferrie drives the lead car.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{all this right under the noses of the intelligence community in lafayette square?}
<A>__{we see the cars cross the long lake pontchartrain bridge and enter a remote guerrilla training camp. bayou and jungle are all around.}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{sure. everybody knew everybody. it was a network. they were working for the cia pilots, black operations guys, civilians, military everybody in those days was running guns somewhere... fort jefferson, bayou bluff, morgan city... mcallen, texas was a big gun running operation.}
<A>__{at the guerrilla training camp at lake pontchartrain in 1963, we see scenes of basic training shooting, obstacle courses, callisthenics led by ferrie and other trainers. scattered among the cubans are several white american mercenaries. we catch a glimpse of oswald and glimpses of several other men we will see again, in sprinklings.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{where is banister in all this?}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{banister was running his camp north of lake pontchartrain. ferrie handled a lot of the training. there was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in cuba. a few americans got trained, too. nazi types. mercenaries. but ferrie was the craziest.}
<A>__{it's night at the training camp. fbi agents race up in cars in the middle of the night, swarming over the camp, rounding up the trainees.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{anyway, late summer the party ended. kennedy didn't want another bay of pigs mess, so he ordered the fbi to shut down the camps and confiscate the napalm and the c 4. there were a buncha cubans and a couple americans arrested, only you didn't read about it in the papers. just the weapons got mentioned... 'cause the first ones behind bars would've been banister and ferrie, but i think the g men were just going through the motions for washington. their hearts were with their old fbi buddy banister.}
<A>__{we see fbi agents loading dynamite, bomb casings, arms 155mm artillery shells, etc. back at the racetrack in 1966, jim listens.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{like i said, a fuckin' nuthouse.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{and oswald?}
<A>__{martin hesitates. we hear the rhythmic beating of the horse hooves and martin sucking on the steaming cup of coffee.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with banister with the door shut. other times he'd be shooting the bull with ferrie. but he was there all right.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{anything more specific, jack? it's important.}
<A>__{flashback to banister's office in 1963. banister and martin shooting the breeze as the straight laced middle aged secretary, delphine roberts, hurries in.}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{yeah, one time the secretary got upset, i remember...}

<D>__{yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance. three years later and he's still classified? they gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... put it in context, bill, of what we know about oswald. lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the marines at 17. he learns russian, he acts overtly marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in japan where u2 spy flights over russia originate. he's discharged from the marines supposedly because his mother's sick. he stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to moscow...}
<A>__{flashback to moscow in 1959. we see shots of the city strange and eerie black and white stills. inside the u.s. embassy oswald slaps his passport on the table with a formal letter. two consuls attend him.}
<C>__{oswald}
<P>__{(voice stilted)}
<D>__{i want to renounce my citizenship and become a soviet citizen. i'm going to make known to them all information i have concerning the marine corps and my specialty therein, radar operation...}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{one of the consuls, john mcvickar, says oswald's performance was not spontaneous it seemed coached. oswald gives an interview to a journalist.}
<A>__{continuing the moscow flashback, we see oswald talking with a female journalist in his small room in the hotel metropole. again he sounds robotic.}
<C>__{oswald}
<D>__{i will never return to the united states for any reason. it is a capitalist country, an exploitive, racist country. i am a marxist since i was 15. i've seen poor niggers and that was a real lesson. people hate because they're told to hate, like school kids. it's the fashion to hate people in the u.s.}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{the russians are skeptical want to send him back. maybe they suspect he's a spy. he supposedly slashes his wrists in a suicide attempt so that they're forced to keep him, and he disappears for six weeks, presumably with the kgb.}
<A>__{we see photos of the city of minks, in russia, oswald with various friends and tourists, shots of lee and marina with a new baby.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{makes sense he's a spokesman.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{but he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the russians. he meets marina, whose uncle is a colonel in soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.}
<C>__{numa}
<D>__{didn't someone say he didn't speak good russian?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{it's a contradiction, numa, get used to them. the only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets. or fake secrets.}
<A>__{we see documentary shots of the u2 on russian soil... francis gary powers... the summit conference canceled... eisenhower and khrushchev.}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{i don't know if it's coincidence, but oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the u2 program from his days at atsugi air base in japan. six months after he arrives in russia, francis gary powers' u2 spy flight goes down in russia. that plane was untouchable. powers hinted that oswald could've given the russians enough data to hit it. as a direct result, the peace summit between khrushchev and eisenhower failed. i can't help thinking of that book seven days in may, maybe someone in our military didn't want the peace conference to happen, maybe oswald was part of that. it gets weirder.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{susie, you're an assistant d.a., remember. stick to what you can prove in court.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{you want facts, bill? okay. from 1945 to '59 only two u.s. soldiers defect to russia. from '59 to '60, seven defect, six return, one of them another marine a month before oswald. all of them young men made to seem poor, disenchanted.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{don't get sidetracked! how does he get back to the states? that's the pointerior does he have any problems?}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{none! the state department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel. he's never investigated or charged by the navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the cia.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{this is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the pacific! he should've been prosecuted as a traitor!}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{the fbi finally gets around to talking to him in dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant communist type.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{but who meets him when he gets off the boat in new york in june '62?}
<A>__{the screen shows photos of new york: empty docks... a ship coming in... wall street on a sunday morning graphic weegee type black and white stills, then a photo of spas t. raikin.}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{spas t. raikin, a leading member of an anti communist group.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{and marina? does she have a problem getting out?}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{none either. it's bizarre. it's next to impossible to get russian sweethearts out. nor does lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to cuba and russia in '63. a man who has defected once already. it's crazy.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{dammit, it doesn't add up! ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations! the state department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to minks to insure oswald's return. only intelligence people can come and go like that.}
<A>__{flashback to a forth worth map factory. we see oswald at work on photo mattes with a minox spy camera. the camera shows close ups of maps and then flashes to a hand in the photographic section. we see a close up of oswald's head in a photograph the same headshot that will be superimposed on the oswald photo and a razor blade cutting mattes.}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{the next thing we know he's living in dallas ft. worth in october '62 working 6 months at jaggars chiles stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the u.s. army... he starts work only days before the government reveals russian missiles in cuba and the crisis explodes. oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the u2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the army security agency.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{sort of like benedict arnold coming back to george washington's cabinet.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{equally incongruous is oswald becoming chummy with the white russian community of dallas all rabid anti communists.}
<A>__{flashback to fort worth in 1963. in oswald's cheap apartment, seven white russians, including george de mohrenschildt, a distinguished grey haired man in his late fifties, are visiting marina and oswald, bringing old dresses, groceries, and toys and milk for the crying baby, whose cradle is two suitcases.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{his closest friend is an oilman named george de mohrenschildt who's about 35 years older than oswald, who's only 23 and supposedly broke. de mohrenschildt is a member of the dallas petroleum club, speaks five languages and was in french vichy intelligence during the war. also rumoured to have been a nazi sympathizer and member of the "solidarists", an international anti communist organization with many eastern europeans and ex nazis, many of them brought here by the cia after the war, many of them involved in oil and munitions interests in dallas and the southwest. you figure it.}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{where'd you get all this nazi stuff?}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(hands him a file)}
<D>__{read it. they called it "project paperclip."}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{this is the guy that keeps turning up in colonial countries and each time something strange happens. coup d'etats, presidents overthrown. he shows up on a "walking tour" of guatemala's cuban invasion camps just before the bay of pigs invasion. if we don't know he's cia, let's circle him very probable oswald's handler.}
<A>__{we see oswald and de mohrenschildt talking with the others and a magazine cover with j.f.k. the subject of discussion.}
<C>__{oswald}
<D>__{i think he's made some mistakes on cuba, but he's doing a pretty good job. if he succeeds, in my opinion, he'll be a great president. and a really attractive one too open features, great head of hair...}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{de mohrenschildt draws a picture of oswald as an intellectual, well read, speaks excellent russian, a man who adored j.f.k.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{that's scenery. don't get sidetracked. this is the man, bottom line, who nailed oswald to the warren commission as a potentially violent man, and linked him to the rifle.}
<T>__{time cut to o:}
<A>__{swald's apartment on a different day in 1963. george de mohrenschildt points out a mannlicher carcano rifle in the closet, turns to lee.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{so, lee, what are you taking a potshot at this week rabbits or fascists?}
<A>__{lee's look is sickly. he freezes up. resume scene of white russian gathering in oswald's apartment.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{the only russian that suspects oswald of still being a communist is anna meller. but her russian friend tells her "he's checked" with the local fbi and was told oswald is all right.}
<A>__{anna meller, one of the guests, glances at a copy of das kapital in a pile of books, and talks to another russian man about it... talking now to lee and marina are janet and bill williams, a mid american couple in their late twenties, freshly minted.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{the oswalds are introduced by george de mohrenschildt to janet and bill williams. it's through janet williams in october '63 that lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on elm street at the book depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.}
<A>__{we see oswald and another man in the texas school book depository in 1963. they are hauling and stacking school textbooks an obviously lower level job for oswald after the map factory. we cut ahead to empty graphics of the sealed off area, the window site, the cafeteria.}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{all i can find out about the williams' is their tax returns are classified and that bill williams, a descendant of the cabots of massachusetts, has links through his family and united fruit to the cia and does classified work for bell helicopter which requires a security clearance so what is oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? williams has a relationship at bell with general walter dornberger, another one of the nazis we brought in after the war for our missile program. he used slave labor to build the v 2 rockets for hitler before bell needed him.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i wonder about the williams'. just where did the first description of oswald come from at 12:44? no one knows. they claimed it was brennan's, but his description came after 1 p.m. who called? somehow the fbi's been tapping the williams' and picks up a call between bell helicopter and janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "we both know who's responsible." who called? why's the bureau been tapping them?}
<A>__{we see the interior of the williams' home in irving on a day in 1963.}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{his wife, janet williams, studied russian in college and her father worked for the agency for international development, which works hand in hand with the cia. she suddenly becomes marina's best friend. marina fights often with lee about many things his secrecy, the lack of money. she says lee is not sexually adequate. lee hits her on several occasions. bill williams' convenient separation from janet allows janet to invite marina to move into her house in irving. there marina and lee have a second daughter while lee, now 24, stores his belongings in janet's garage and rents a small room in dallas under an alias of "o.h. lee".}
<A>__{we see marina and oswald in bed at night in the williams' house, in a tender scene. oswald says goodbye to his child.}
<T>__{time cut to o:}
<A>__{swald living in a boarding house. it is at night, and he sits in his room alone. the housekeeper, earlene roberts, heavyset, white, in her 60's, comes in and asks him if he wants to watch some tv with her. he declines.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{when he's arrested, marina buries him with the public. her description of him is that of a psychotic and violent man.}
<A>__{flashback to marina on tv, a different person from before.}

<D>__{i do not want to believe, but i have too much facts.. tell me that lee shot kennedy.}
<C>__{jim }

<D>__{oswald was no angel, that's clear, but who was he?}
<A>__{back to antoine's restaurant.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i'm lost, boss. what are we saying here?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{we're saying that when oswald went to russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{and therefore because oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief. that's what you're saying!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i will go you one better! maybe oswald didn't even pull the trigger, bill. the nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on november 22nd. and on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{he had his palm print on the weapon.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{it went to the goddamn fbi and they didn't find a goddamn thing. it comes back a week later and one guy in the dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all i know he could've taken off oswald at the morgue. there's no chain of evidence, bill. and what about the tow guns actually seen in the depository? one an enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a mauser, described by deputy weitzman... maybe, just maybe, lee oswald was exactly what he said he was bill "a patsy". take it at face value. lou, susie, i'm going with my gut here. he's got an alias of hidell to buy the rifle, "o.h. lee" to rent the room, right? what's in a name, right? in intelligence, they're assumed to be fake. a name is sort of like a postbox number, a code several different people can use the same name, right? then why can't somebody be using oswald's name?}
<A>__{we see blank faces around the table.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{but why?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{to frame him, obviously. you got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, bill! they're not ordinary crooks.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{i never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{unless he or someone else wants him to get caught. maybe he never ordered the weapon, lou. somebody else did. it was picked up at the post office early morning when oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job. lou, come alive. these things are not adding up.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss. susie's stuff is colorful, but...}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{let's start making some assumptions about the man. why would he leave a path as big as lee harvey oswald's? this is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one. who found the evidence? who set him up? lou, bill, susie, i want you to go back and check all the sightings of oswald in dallas, new orleans and mexico in the summer and fall of '63 see if it's the same guy.}
<C>__{al}

<C>__{jim}

<D>__{mr. garrison what can i do for you on easter sunday?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mr. shaw, to interrupt this holiday, but i feel this is a conversation we might better have out of the everyday bustle in this office...}

<D>__{i'm not sure i understand.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(bringing some papers forward)}
<D>__{well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.}
<C>__{shaw}
<D>__{i wouldn't imagine where.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{we recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you. are you acquainted with a david logan?}
<C>__{shaw}
<D>__{no. never heard of him.}
<C>__{jim}

<C>__{shaw}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jim}

<C>__{shaw}
<D>__{no, i don't believe i know anyone by that name.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{mr. o'keefe told us he met you at the masquerade bar down in the quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on dauphine street. do you recall that?}
<A>__{flashback to clay's dauphine street residence, in the quarter, at night in 1962. the butler opens the door and o'keefe is admitted to the townhouse. shaw appears behind the butler.}
<C>__{shaw }
<P>__{(in present)}
<D>__{of course not. i don't know this man. obviously then, i wouldn't have him to dinner. incidentally, i do not live in an apartment. it's an 1860's house built by gallier. i've restored it faithfully. you know i am quite an advocate of restoration.}
<A>__{at shaw's house, dinner is served at a long table by the black butler. the table is decorated by a sumptuous setting of silver and candelabra. shaw uses a bell to summon the butler.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. mr. o'keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter a colored man. he particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other which he found rather unusual because the table was so long. does that bring back memories of willie o'keefe?}
<C>__{shaw}
<P>__{(in present)}
<D>__{not at all. but on the other hand, i do have a lovely chippendale dining table and i often have a friend over sitting at one end while i sit at the other. that is precisely the point of a long dining table. the splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.}
<C>__{shaw}
<D>__{it adds a taste of elegance for which i must confess a weakness for now and then. i call him smedley. his real name is frankie jenkins but i could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "frankie!" .. where is this leading to, mr. garrison?}

<C>__{jim }
<D>__{after dinner you paid him to have sex with you.}

<C>__{jim}
<D>__{mr. shaw, this is an italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the board of centro mondo commerciale in italy, that this company was a creature of the cia for the transfer of funds in italy for illegal political espionage activities. it says that this company was expelled from italy for those activities.}

<D>__{now this is significant, because it is standard operating procedure, especially in a known hostile city like dallas, to supplement the secret service. even if we had not allowed the bubbletop to be removed from the limousine, we'd've put at least 100 to 200 agents on the sidewalks, without question! there'd already been several attempts on de gaulle's life in france. only a month before in dallas un ambassador adlai stevenson had been spit on and hit. we'd have arrived days ahead of time, studied the route, checked all the buildings... we never would've allowed all those wide open empty windows overlooking dealey... never... we would have had our own snipers covering the area. the moment a window went up they'd have been on the radio. we would've been watching the crowds packages, rolled up newspapers, a coat over an arm, never would have let a man open an umbrella along the way never would've allowed that limousine to slow down to 10 miles per hour, much less take that unusual curve at houston and elm. you would have felt an army presence in the streets that day, but none of this happened. it was a violation of the most basic protection codes we have. and it is the best indication of a massive plot in dallas. who could have best done that? people in my business, mr. garrison. people like my superior officer could've told col. reich, "look we have another unit coming from so and so providing security. you'll stand down." that day, in fact, there were some individual army intelligence people in dallas and i'm still trying to figure out who and why. but they weren't protecting the client. one of them, by the way, was caught in the book depository after police sealed it off.}

<D>__{army intell had a "harvey lee oswald" on file, but all those files have been destroyed. many strange things were happening that day, and lee harvey oswald had nothing to do with them. we had the entire cabinet on a trip to the far east. we had a third of a combat division returning from germany in the air above the united states at the time of the shooting, and at 12:34 p.m., the entire telephone system went dead in washington for a solid hour, and on the plane back to washington, word was radioed from the white house situation room to lyndon johnson that one individual performed the assassination. does that sound like a bunch of coincidences to you, mr. garrison? not for one moment. the cabinet was out of the country to get their perception out of the way. the troops were in the air for possible riot control. the phones didn't work to keep the wrong stories from spreading if anything went wrong with the plan. nothing was left to chance. i bet you there were even backup teams and cars on the other side of the underpass in the event that kennedy got through wounded. they would have moved in with vehicles like they did with de gaulle. he could not be allowed to escape alive.}

<D>__{kennedy's directives were never really implemented, because of bureaucratic resistance, but one of the results was that the cuban operation was turned over to my department as "operation mongoose", which meant that people like my superior officer, general y, took over the cuban personnel that were being trained to invade cuba and the bases like the training camp at pontchartrain in your home state that were closed down by kennedy... and that's how the "black ops" people, people like general y, ended up taking the rules of covert warfare they'd used abroad and brought'em into this country. now they had the people, the equipment, bases and the motivation... check out an old cia man, bill harvey ran something called "executive action", which carried out foreign assassinations. harvey was also involved with the fake defection program that got oswald into russia. check out the cabell brothers. interesting links to this case.}

<D>__{so for those reasons, you're going to trial against clay shaw, chief? well, you're gonna lose! we should be investigating all our mafia leads here in new orleans carlos marcello, santos trafficante i can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the government. ruby's all mob, knows oswald, sets him up. hoffa trafficante marcello, they hire some guns and they do kennedy and maybe the government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the mob to get to castro. y'know, castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to john q. citizen. so they close the book on j.f.k. it makes sense to me.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i don't doubt their involvement, bill, but at a low level. could the mob change the parade route, bill, or eliminate the protection for the president? could the mob send oswald to russia and get him back? could the mob get the fbi, the cia, and the dallas police to make a mess of the investigation? could the mob appoint the warren commission to cover it up? could the mob wreck the autopsy? could the mob influence the national media to go to sleep? and since when has the mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? the mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude. assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules. this was a military style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with lyndon johnson waiting in the wings.}

<D>__{to prove their was a conspiracy involving clay shaw we must prove there was more than one man involved in the assassination. to do that, we must look at the zapruder film, which my office has subpoenaed. the american public has not seen that film because it has been kept locked in a vault in the time life building in new york city for the last five years. there is a reason for that. watch.}
<A>__{the zapruder film (8mm) now rolls. we have seen pieces of it before in the opening of the film, but now we see it whole. it is crucial that this piece of film be repeated several times during the trial to drive home a point that is easily lost on casual viewing. the first viewing is silent except for the sound of the clanky projector. it lasts about 25 seconds, and then the lights come on. the jury is shaken. the judge is shaken. the people in the courtroom murmur. even clay shaw is surprised at what he has seen. jim says nothing, letting the truth of it sink in. then:}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{a picture speaks a thousand words. yet sometimes the truth is too simple for some... the warren commission thought they had an open and shut case: three bullets, one assassin but two things happened that made it virtually impossible: 1)the zapruder film which you just saw, and 2)the third wounded man, jim tague, who was nicked by a fragment down by the triple underpass. the time frame of 5.6 seconds established by the zapruder film left no possibility of a fourth shot from oswald's rifle, but the shot or fragment that left a superficial wound on tague's cheek had to come from a bullet that missed the car entirely. now they had two bullets that hit, and we know one of them was the fatal head shot. so a single bullet remained to account for all seven wounds in kennedy and connally. but rather than admit to a conspiracy or investigate further, the commission chose to endorse the theory put forth by an ambitious junior counsellor, arlen specter. one of the grossest lies ever forced on the american people, we've come to know it as the "magic bullet" theory.}
