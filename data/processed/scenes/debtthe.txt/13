<L>__{exterior terrace. hotel near tel aviv night}
<A>__{a celebratory dinner for the book launch is in progress publishers, journalists, local dignitaries... rachel is re joining the table, taking her place beside her daughter amidst the dinner party chatter. sarah watches her.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{when are you going to stop?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{stop what?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{the smoking.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{soon.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i hope so. do it for your grandson.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{are you sure you have to go back home tomorrow?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{it's all arranged, i'm afraid...}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{but we'll have breakfast before you go? i thought maybe we could take a walk on the beach? (trying to sound casual) i'd like you to see more of him.}
<A>__{a waiter leans over with wine for rachel. she covers her glass.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(to sarah, ill at ease)}
<D>__{well, i will be back. we can...maybe in the holidays or...}
<A>__{miriam, a publisher appears at her shoulder with a copy of sarah's book.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{i've marked the place. i thought perhaps from chapter eleven...?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{...yes, thank you.}
<A>__{rachel nods absently, flicking through the pages of the book. sarah realizes, with a small stab of pain, that she has no idea what that means.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{if you'd rather read something else, mother.....}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{no, that's fine.}
<A>__{rachel is barely listening. she is staring at a black and white photograph in the book. we see that the photograph is of a young man in nazi uniform. it's titled: dieter vogel, "the surgeon of birkenau."}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{you must be very proud.}
<A>__{rachel looks up at her, realizes what miriam is talking about.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(a little automatic)}
<D>__{...it's a wonderful achievement. i'm very proud of her.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{and i'm sure you were invaluable in the research.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(keeping it light)}
<D>__{actually, my mother withstood all interrogation. my father was the talker. (trying a joke) i'm the only journalist in israel she won't speak to.}
<A>__{miriam laughs obligingly but sarah instantly regrets the remark. there is a sudden excited murmur from the table. the women look over to where stephan approaches the table. he is in a motorised wheelchair. the mossad agent attends discreetly in the background. rachel's face hardens.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i thought he couldn't come.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(standing up, surprised)}
<D>__{so did i.}
<A>__{several of the local politicos have stood up to greet stephan, who is all smiles and handshakes.}
<C>__{stephan}
<P>__{(to the politicos)}
<D>__{please, sit, sit. my god, it must be election season.}
<A>__{there's good natured laughter from the table. sarah joins her father, kissing his cheek.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you came.}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{i came. so you're the famous author i've heard so much about?}
<A>__{rachel watches as he takes a place at the table, picks up a copy of the book and examines the cover photograph, holding his glasses a little from his eyes to focus.}
<C>__{stephan }
<P>__{(without looking)}
<D>__{rachel.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{stephan.}
<C>__{stephan}
<P>__{(to sarah)}
<D>__{now you're the expert, maybe you could tell me something.}
<P>__{(pointing to himself) who's this}
<D>__{handsome devil on the cover?}
<A>__{more polite laughter from the table.}
<C>__{stephan }
<D>__{it went well?}
<C>__{sarah's husband}
<D>__{she was wonderful.}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{that's good. good, good. that's very good.}
<A>__{rachel takes a sip of water and notices stephen's hands, crumbling some bread they're shaking. she looks up at his face, reads the hidden strain there. he senses her gaze and meets it, and for a second his smile falters and something like panic flickers in his eyes. rachel stares back at him, disturbed. miriam stands, tapping her glass with her fork.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{i just want thank you all for coming to help us celebrate the launch of this wonderful book. i'm sure we're all particularly thrilled to have two of the heroes of this story at the table. and even more thrilled that one of them has agreed to read for us...}
<A>__{applause. she gestures to rachel who stands, still looking at stephan. the table quietens down. rachel opens the book at the marked place and hesitates, only now realising what she is about to read. then...}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"on the evening of the 31st of december, it began to rain more heavily. so isolated had they become from the outside world that it was only when she looked out of the window that rachel remembered it was new year's eve...}
