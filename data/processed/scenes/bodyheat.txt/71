<L>__{interior tulio's restaurant dusk}
<A>__{the best restaurant in miranda beach. racine slips on his jacket as he comes in the door. he waves to the hostess across the dining room, indicating he'll be alone tonight. she signals a short wait. he steps toward the bar, bringing him suddenly face to face with matty.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{well, well. hello to you }
<A>__{the panic which shoots across her face, cuts him off in mid sentence, a split second before edmund walker appears behind her. matty's face goes calm and she smiles politely.}
<C>__{matty}
<P>__{(to racine)}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{she turns to her husband. he is not what racine expected. he may, in fact, be mean, as matty described him, but he looks neither small nor weak. a handsome man, he is bigger than racine and in terrific shape. dressed in an expensive summer suit, he radiates vigor and controlled physical power. he wears sleek, metal framed glasses.}

<D>__{darling, i'd like you to meet mr. racine. i'm sorry. i don't know your first name.}
<C>__{racine}
