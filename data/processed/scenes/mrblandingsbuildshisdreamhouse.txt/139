<L>__{interior the blandings' living room night}
<A>__{note: the house is painted and almost completely furnished. a hard rain beats on the windows. there is a blazing fire in the fireplace. muriel, in a warm bathrobe, sits near it, comfortably knitting. in fact, the scene is exactly the one jim has just described, except that the man with slippers, pipe and smoking jacket, reading the paper, is bill cole. near the fire, bill's rain drenched jacket, shirt and shoes are hanging up to dry. the cozy tranquillity is broken by a sharp ringing of the front doorbell.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(with relief)}
<D>__{thank heavens! the children.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{stay put. you look too comfortable.}
<A>__{the camera follows bill to the front door. he opens it. a man in raincoat and boots stands there in the pouring, driving rain. the man enters as bill struggles to get the door shut against the wind.}
<C>__{mr. jones}
<D>__{whew! what a night! i'm jones, from down the road. just came over to tell you your kids are all right, mr. blandings.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{oh, i'm not mr. blandings. cole's the name, bill cole.}
<A>__{he sees jones' doubtful look at the smoking jacket, feels an explanation is necessary.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{friend of the family. wet clothes. just came in out of the rain.}
<A>__{muriel walks into scene. jones takes in the bathrobe, again looks skeptically at bill.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{i'm mrs. blandings.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{how do. mrs. williams just called. says your phone's out of order. wanted me to tell you the water's rising and they've got the bridge roped off. girls'll spend the night over at her place.}
<C>__{muriel}

<P>__{(uncertainly)}
<D>__{well 'night.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{goodnight... and thanks so much.}
<A>__{the door is opened with a terrific swirl of wind and rain. jones exits as muriel and bill push the door against the wind, finally getting it shut.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{that's fine. no bridge. how do i get back to lansdale?}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{you'll just have to spend the night right here.}
<A>__{as they start back into the living room:}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{muriel, really! with your husband in new york and your children away think of my reputation.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(smile)}
<D>__{don't worry, snow white, you'll be as pure and unsullied in the morning as you were the night before.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(with resignation)}
<D>__{that's the story of my life.}
<A>__{muriel pokes the dying fire, looks up thoughtfully.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{poor jim, he sounded so worried before. i certainly hope he comes up with something.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{don't worry about the man who gave the world "when you've got the whim, say wham!" this well will never run dry.}
