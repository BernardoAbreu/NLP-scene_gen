<D>__{each little flower that opens, each little bird that sings, he made their glowing colors, he made their tiny wings.}
<L>__{interior downe village church. the past. day.}
<A>__{the church is packed for the sunday morning service the darwin family stand in the front row. emma, the servants and the rest of the family are singing lustily: parslow a somewhat pompous operatic tenor, brodie and innes both loudly scottish (innes out of tune), annie by darwins side, trilling along in a tuneful little descant. she notices her father is not singing and offers him her hymn book with the words. darwin smiles and returns it. its not that he doesn't know the lyrics, its just that he can't bring himself to say them.}
<C>__{darwin family}
<D>__{all things bright and beautiful all creatures great and small. all things wize and wonderful the lord god made them all.}

<A>__{everyone bows their heads in prayer.}
<C>__{innes }
<D>__{lord god we know the world is governed by thy plan.}
<A>__{darwin is immediately not listening. he looks along the row of his children, standing dutifully in a line between charles and emma. george, aged 5, is studying the woodlice which are nesting between the pages of his hymnal}

<D>__{extending even to the merest creatures thou hast made, such that even a sparrow falls not to the ground without thy will.}

<C>__{innes}
<D>__{teach us that all misfortune. all sickness and death, all the trials and miseries of which we daily complain are intended for our good, being not the vagaries of an uncaring universe but the corrections of a wize and affectionate parent}
<A>__{innes looks up sternly and sees the darwin's head raised among the sea of down turned heads. their eyes meet briefly in a sort of challenge, and in that moment, darwin somehow knows with absolutely certainty that religious faith has left him. with a whispered word to the beadle standing next to him to take the collection darwin slips out from the pew and heads off up the aisle.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{excuse me}
<A>__{he's intending to be quiet and subtle but the creaking boards under his feet loudly announce his departure. innes raises his voice above the fusillade.}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{turn with me now to the book of job, chapter two verse twelve}
<A>__{the congregation, not daring to raise their heads, watch darwin's sturdy walking shoes departing down the aisle.}
