<L>__{interior caesar's apartment night}
<A>__{violet leads her through the apartment. it is expensively furnished with very masculine tastes; a lot of gray and black leather.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i was doing some dishes and just as i pulled the stopper my earring fell in.}
<A>__{corky looks at her blankly.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{it's one of my favorites. that's why i got upset. i know it probably seems ridiculous to you.}
<A>__{an eyebrow goes up.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i'm sorry, look, forget it. i shouldn't have called...}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i told bianchinni i would take a look. is it that sink?}
<A>__{violet nods. she opens the sink cabinet and pulls out a pair of channel locks from her back pocket. the teeth of the channel locks open and bite onto the pressure nut.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{do you have a pot or a bucket?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{she hands one down to her. corky slides it under the curved pipe. as she works, corky feels herself staring at violet, at the hem of her dress curving tightly around her thighs. water begins to trickle into the pan. the nut slides loose and corky tips the trap. water splashes into the pan with a soft metal "tink."}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{did you find it?}
<A>__{corky fishes into gray water and pulls out the earring. violet screams, a huge smile on her face, half falling as she tries to hug corky.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i can't believe it! you did it!}
<A>__{corky leans back under and replaces the trap.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{thank you so much. you have to let me pay you something }
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{no. mr. bianchinni asked me to do it. i did it.}
<A>__{corky checks the drain by running the water.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{if you won't take money, how about a drink? it's getting late. you can't work all night.}
<A>__{corky eyes her for a moment.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{okay, one drink.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{a beer?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{a beer. of course.}
<A>__{she smiles and turns to the bar.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{sit down.}
<A>__{corky sits on the black leather couch and violet returns with two bottles of heineken. corky sneers.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{thanks again.}
<A>__{they clink the bottles and swig.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you seem uncomfortable. do i make you nervous, corky?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she looks at violet, then takes another long pull on the bottle.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{thirsty, maybe.}
<A>__{violet smiles, her eyes again talking for her.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{curious, maybe.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{curious? that's funny, i'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.}
<A>__{violet notices the tattoo on corky's arm.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{that's a great tattoo.}
<A>__{she reaches over and touches it.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{beautiful labrys.}
<A>__{corky is a bit suprised that she knows what it is. she nods, rubbing it as if trying to hide it.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{are you surprised that i know what it is?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i have a tattoo, would you like to see it?}
<A>__{she moves closer, sliding over the leather cushions as she opens the front of her dress.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{a woman in upstate new york did it for me.}
<A>__{she is not wearing a bra.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{here. do you like it?}
<A>__{set against the soft white skin of her breast is a bright green stemmed violet.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{it took her all day to do it. she promised me it wouldn't hurt, but it was sore for a long time after. i couldn't even touch it.}
<A>__{corky looks up from violet's breast to her dark eyes.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{but now i love the way it feels.}
<A>__{she runs her fingers softly over the slightly scarred skin.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{here, touch it.}
<A>__{corky feels the blood pounding in her ears as violet takes her hand and places it on her breast.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{violet looks at her.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{isn't it obvious? i'm trying to seduce you.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{because i want to. i've wanted to since i first saw you in the elevator.}
<A>__{corky watches her, trying to figure her out even as her thumb presses into violet's nipple. inhaling sharply, violet closes her eyes; she can feel corky staring at her.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you don't believe me. but i can prove it to you.}
<A>__{she takes corky's wrist and begins pulling her hand down her body.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you can't believe me because of what you see ...}
<A>__{she forces corky's hand between her legs, up under her dress.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{but you can believe what you feel.}
<A>__{violet opens her eyes, a wanton smile on her lips.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you see ... i've been thinking about you all day.}
<A>__{corky's forearm flexes and violet moans. with both hands, violet takes hold of corky's forearm.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{you planned this whole thing?}
<A>__{violet's head swims; she is unable to breathe.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{you dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{if i say yes, will you take your hand away?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{... yes.}
<A>__{now it is corky who smiles. violet shivers, her thighs rubbing, her hips thrusting against corky's hand.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{please, corky ... please ...}
<A>__{her eyes barely open.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{... kiss me.}
<A>__{in a single motion, corky takes hold of the back of her neck and covers violet's open mouth with her own. with her hand still stuffed between violet's legs, corky lays her back onto the couch as the kiss becomes more more desperate, more hungry until we hear the front door unlock and open.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{violet?}
<A>__{violet's eyes pop open and she pushes corky back.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{violet, you home?}
<A>__{they scramble to compose themselves.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{yeah. in here, c.}
<A>__{he comes around the corner and in the dim light sees the two figures sitting close on the couch.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{what's this?}
<A>__{he mistakes corky for a man.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{what the fuck is this?}
<A>__{violet stands as caesar barrels toward the couch.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i didn't expect }
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{what the fuck is going on?}
<A>__{corky stands and turns, caesar suddenly realizing that she is a woman.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{oh, shit ...}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{caesar, this is corky. corky, caesar.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i'm sorry, christ, i thought ... it's fucking dark in here.}
<A>__{he reaches to the wall for the lights.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{she is working for bianchinni.}
<A>__{caesar extends his hand.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{oh, right, right. don mentioned that to me. hi, welcome to the family.}
<A>__{corky shakes his hand.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{you're helping rajeev?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{no. rajeev's in india.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{she's doing the work herself.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{no shit. bianchinni hired you? you know he's a good friend of mine. |family, really.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{that's what violet said.}
<A>__{he looks at her as if he knows something.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{so, you just got out?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{jesus, caesar!}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{what? it ain't no big fuckin' deal. i know who don hires. did you know he did time himself?}
<A>__{corky shakes her head.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{thirteen fucking years. see, there ain't no secrets here.}
<A>__{corky doesn't like this man.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{how many'd you do?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{five.}
<A>__{he whistles.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{not bad. what for?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{that's none of your goddamn business, caesar.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{you're right. you don't have to tell me, if you don't want to. i just hope you understand you're among good people here.}
<A>__{he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a thick fold of money and peels several hundreds. corky stares at it.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{come on, come on. if you understand what i'm talking about you're going to take the money. if you don't, i'm going to have to worry about you.}
<A>__{corky takes it. caesar smiles.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{good. i hate to worry. i got ulcers.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i should be going.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{what? how about a drink?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{my brushes, i have to clean my brushes. thanks, though.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{another time.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{sure.}
