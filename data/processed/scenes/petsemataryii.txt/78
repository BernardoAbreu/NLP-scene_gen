<A>__{the kids quickly scramble for hiding places in the bordering brush, dropping their beer cans as fast as they can. as drew leaps to his feet, he upsets the fire, knocking one of the logs. a flaming ember rolls to the base of one of the brittle old crosses. drew and geoff run for it.}
<L>__{exterior path, archway night}
<A>__{gus moves quickly up the meandering path, sending the blinding beam of his flashlight over the graves.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{you boys better not be drinking!}
<L>__{exterior pet sematary night}
<A>__{through the thick woods, drew is flanked by geoff and clyde.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{oh man, he's gonna kick my ass...}
<A>__{drew starts to take off. clyde trips him on his first stride. drew hits the dirt.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{thanks for fucking up our halloween, dumbshit!}
<A>__{clyde recedes into the woods as gus approaches the campfire. he scans the area with his flashlight, illuminating the various beer cans.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{drew, you get your ass out here! front and center!}
<A>__{geoff pulls drew to his feet. gus passes the flashlight over the woods. kids duck away, retreating from their hiding places... the flashlight sweeps toward drew. drew freezes, spotlighted by gus' beam. a burst of lightning floods drew's horrified face.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{get out here, joker.}
<A>__{geoff remains frozen in the woods nearby, out of gus' light. behind gus, the wooden cross is completely on fire now.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{you out here making a fool of me?}
<A>__{drew shakes his head in instant denial.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i'm warning you, buddy! you don't play by the rules, i'm gonna shadow your ass for eternity!}
<A>__{drew makes a break from his spot in the woods. he weaves through the markers, arcing around the outer perimeter to avoid gus... ...but gus is quicker. he zigzags through the crosses and headstones to intercept drew. gus gets a handful of drew's collar and yanks him in.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{you little shit!}
<A>__{gus draws his free arm back and smacks drew across the face. drew goes down.}
<B>__{geoff}
<A>__{is looking on from the woods, horrified. torn...}
<B>__{drew}
<A>__{cowers on the ground, trying to scramble away. geoff bolts out into the firelight, staring defiantly at gus in silent accusation. gus is beyond furious. lightning flashes again.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{you get out of here, geoff matthews! this is between me and my boy!}
<A>__{geoff doesn't move. gus starts to advance forward... ...but the growl emanating from the woods gives him pause. everyone turns... a rustling is heard in the bushes, and zowie emerges into the building firelight, flashing his fangs at gus. his eyes glow red. gus freezes, studying zowie. zowie inches forward, poised for the attack.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{call off your dog, drew.}
<A>__{drew shifts his eyes from zowie to gus, too terrified to heed such a command. zowie brushes past drew and geoff, moving in on gus. gus' eyes shift to burning cross at his side. with a swift boot, he kicks over the cross and presses it into his grip. swinging the cross like a primitive weapon, gus connects with the side of zowie's head. zowie spins a full circle from the impact. but he lands on all fours. unphased. taking the next step toward gus. there's something clearly not of this world in zowie's vicious stare.}
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(terrified)}
<D>__{drew, call him off!}
<A>__{all drew can manage is a faint appeal.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{zowie...}
<A>__{zowie goes for gus, launching into the air...}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{drew!}
<A>__{...and sinking his glistening fangs into gus' neck. an eruption of blood showers the closest headstone. gus comes helplessly tumbling down with the weight of the dog. his screams are suddenly cut short as zowie rips out his throat. his arms flail weakly at his sides, then grow still. drew and geoff stare at the scene, wide eyed with shock. zowie looks up from gus' neck with dripping, red fangs. for a moment, his eyes settle on drew. then zowie bolts off, disappearing into the night.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{oh, god. oh, god...}
<A>__{drew's eyes shift to geoff, whose face is flushed with sickened fear.}
<C>__{geoff}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{is he dead?}
<A>__{in dazed shock, drew moves in for a closer look at the body. gus' eyes are wide open. blood is still pumping in rhythm from his jugular with each weakening beat of his heart. it's a gruesome image against the roaring fire. drew kneels at gus' side. he wants to touch him. to shake him awake, but with every attempt, he draws his hand back.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{is he breathing? can you hear him breathing?}
<A>__{drew leans forward, turning his ear toward gus' gaping mouth. and as he inches closer... gus' fingers twitch his hand jerks up and closes around drew's neck. gus stares up at him with his crazed menace. drew screams. his fingers claw at gus' hand, desperate to pry it loose... ...but then, gus' hand relaxes as his last, dying ounce of strength fades away. drew shrinks back, crouching over the lifeless body as the blazing firelight dances over it. he turns his tear filled gaze to geoff.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{oh man, geoff... we killed him... we killed him...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what're we gonna do?}
<A>__{geoff draws closer and looks down into the dead man's face.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{we could bring him back.}
<A>__{drew's eyes widen at the suggestion. and now, gazing down on gus' body, and on the boys, we pull up}
