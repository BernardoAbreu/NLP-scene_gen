<A>__{bytes and the boy are riding along the road. bytes turns in his seat and opens a hatch in the roof. he looks down in. inside the wagon, lit by the last dregs of the sunset, is merrick, huddled in his sleeping posture. he feels the light and looks up weakly, wheezing, obviously very sick. a small bowl of potatoes sets untouched beside him.}

<D>__{bytes... please!}

<D>__{eat, my treasure, i want you healthy.}

<A>__{field & road (morning) we see a field with a road in the distance, leading to it. it is misty, the sun barely peeking through the rolling clouds above. on the road, the wagon is plodding toward us. at the bottom of the frame a female pinhead in a dress comes into view. she is watching the wagon. a dwarf comes into view beside her. she points to the wagon and she and the dwarf excitedly confer. they turn back to watch its progress and the dwarf reaches up and takes the pinhead's hand. we move back slowly to reveal a ring of circus wagons in the field. another dwarf comes up to the two other freaks and watches the wagon. we pull back further to see a small circus. there are little stalls, and cages containing two mangey lions, some screeching spider monkeys and some squawking parrots. the circus is abustle in the drab grey field. close up of the pinhead jumping up and down in her excitement. there is a clap of thunder.}
