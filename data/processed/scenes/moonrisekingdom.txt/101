<A>__{the next morning. sam and suzy are asleep with their arms wrapped around each other inside the tent. they wear only their underwear. the sound of an airplane approaches. sam's eyes open. the noise buzzes by loudly overhead. suzy sits up. sam scrambles to his feet, unzips the flaps of the tent, and looks out. suzy crouches beside him, holding onto his leg.}
<T>__{they see:}
<A>__{captain sharp standing on the beach fifteen feet away. scout master ward waits behind him with gadge, skotak, and lazy eye. mr. and mrs. bishop stride up out of the water. mr. bishop looks incensed. they are wet to the waist. the police launch is moored in the lagoon. two larger boats with st. jack wood fire brigade printed on their hulls float further away. men in red caps stand on their decks. suzy pulls sam back inside. she zips up the tent again. she kisses sam. mr. bishop hollers:}
<C>__{mr. bishop}
<D>__{suzy! get out here!}
<A>__{mr. bishop grabs hold of the entire tent by the top and rips it up out of the ground, uprooting the stakes which go flying. this reveals: sam and suzy, half naked, entwined, kissing. mr. and mrs. bishop both freeze. sam and suzy look up to them. mr. bishop growls and roars at them ferociously like a monster. sam and suzy look horrified. mr. bishop's face suddenly drains of all emotion. pause. mrs. bishop commands sam and suzy:}
<C>__{mrs. bishop}
<D>__{put your clothes on. both of you.}
<A>__{sam and suzy remain perfectly still. mrs. bishop grabs suzy by the arm and jerks her to her feet. sam and suzy hang onto each other. mrs. bishop slaps suzy with a whack. sam lets go, and suzy is gone. scout master ward comes over to sam sadly and hands him his uniform. sam takes it. scout master ward turns to the other scouts, claps his hands twice, and says:}
<C>__{scout master ward}
<D>__{strike this camp.}
<A>__{sam starts putting on his socks. captain sharp watches him.}
