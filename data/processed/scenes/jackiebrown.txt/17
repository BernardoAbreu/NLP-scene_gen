<D>__{i'm gonna sell the other two tonight. this group of koreans in koreatown have started a neighborhood watch kinda thing. and they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. so i'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. only problem, i aint never dealt with these koreans before. now i aint worried. asians are by and large real dependable. they don't want no trouble. you might argue about price, but you aint gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. but i got me kind of a rule. never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. that's why i need you, backup.}
