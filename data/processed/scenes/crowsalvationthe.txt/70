<A>__{a large crime scene marked off by tape, dutton's cruiser where he left it. several other cruisers nearby, lights flashing. an ambulance, stretcher being unloaded now. an action newsteam the one we've seen before, barbara gonzalez frontman, speaking into a mic, too far away for us to hear.}
<L>__{interior randall house erin's bedroom night}
<A>__{close on a tv. gonzalez audible now.}
