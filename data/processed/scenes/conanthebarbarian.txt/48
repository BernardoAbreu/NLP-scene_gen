<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior oasis night}
<A>__{the man of war dominates the center of the oasis, its torches illuminating the scene before it. akhun and the turanians hold chains connected to the twenty women monks, kneeling, with their wrists chained to their neck collars. in front of them kneels fassir, beaten and bloodied. khalar singh, fariq, and ukafa step down from the man of war. fariq carries with him a large iron box with ornate carvings on it.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{all these years searching the ends of the earth. and here you are. just a two day ride from khor kalba. i can scarcely believe it.}
<C>__{fassir}
<P>__{(in acheronian, to monks)}
<D>__{say nothing.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<P>__{(in acheronian)}
<D>__{yes. say nothing. maybe he doesn't know who we are. maybe he's not looking for the queen.}
<A>__{several of the women look up at him, shocked.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{that's right, my brethren, you have been lied to all your lives. told you must hide yourselves, told you were alone. i want you to look at me, and see me for what i am. a brother. a friend. i have come not to hurt you, but liberate you.}
<C>__{fassir}
<D>__{you come for your own dark purposes, to raise acheron.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{yes. i come to resurrect the greatest empire hyboria has ever known.}
<C>__{fassir}
<D>__{an empire of evil, soaked in blood sacrifice and the blackest of magic.}
<A>__{khalar singh becomes infuriated, eyes blazing.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{have you hidden from the world so long that you cannot to see? blood, magic, death: it is everywhere. acheron is no different than any other kingdom, but for its glory.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{and in place of that glory, you offer shame? i knew shame, but that was before i was shown my true lineage.}
<A>__{khalar draws closer to the women, looking them each in the eye.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{when i was but a child, raiders destroyed my village, cut our fathers to ribbons, and burned our women as sacrifice to foreign gods. those few who survived, we ran for our lives, chased into caves at the edge of the eastern sea, left with nothing to live for. but then we discovered it. acheron. the temple that spawned an empire. we learned that we were not broken goat herders on a desolate coastline. we were the sons and daughters of kings.}
<P>__{(stares in ilira's eyes)}
<D>__{and queens.}
<A>__{he motions to fariq, who brings the iron box forward.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{for thirty years i have searched for you. in that time i built both an army and empire, but they are nothing compared to what we can create together. we can raise acheron again. never again will we hide like rats. never again will we watch as our loved ones are slaughtered. i call forth the queen. stand and join me, and this day will have a joyous end.}
<A>__{no one moves.}
<C>__{fassir}
<D>__{you would have all the world suffer, as you have suffered. we will die before we help you.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{yes. you will.}
<A>__{he nods to his son. he paces in front of the female monks, the box in front of them.}
<C>__{fariq}
<D>__{the caves beneath khor khalba contain all manner of creature, many altered by centuries of blood magic. but one, in particular, has developed a special connection to the blood. a thirst. it is said that only the queen of acheron itself can resist its embrace.}
<A>__{he stops, one woman away from ilira.}
<C>__{fariq }
<D>__{so what say you? will you be the lucky one, or will you tell me who is?}
<A>__{a tear falls down her face, but she stays silent. there's the sound of slithering as fariq opens the box. she stares down inside the box }
<B>__{and screams.}
