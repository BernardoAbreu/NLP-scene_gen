<D>__{now, please, if you've finished your prayers, could we begin with business.}
<A>__{he has been looking at gandhi, who sits on the floor of the large room some distance from him, just lifting his head from prayers. nehru, patel and azad are on the same side of the room as gandhi. they rise from prayer as jinnah comes down the steps to them. gandhi hesitates, then begins.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{my dear jinnah, you and i are brothers born of the same mother india. if you have fears, i want to put them to rest.}
<P>__{(jinnah listens}
<D>__{impatiently, skeptically. gandhi just glances in}
<P>__{nehru's direction.)}
<D>__{i am asking panditji to stand down. i want you to be the first prime minister of india}
<P>__{(jinnah raises an eyebrow of interest.)}
<D>__{ to name your entire cabinet, to make the head of every government department a muslim.}
<A>__{and jinnah has drawn himself up. his vanity is too great not to be touched by that prospect. he measures gandhi for a moment to see that he is sincere, and when he is satisfied with that, he turns slowly to nehru, patel and azad. nehru glances at patel. they have all been taken by surprise by the offer and do not feel what gandhi feels. nehru looks hesitantly at gandhi.}
<C>__{nehru}
<D>__{bapu, for me, and the rest,}
<P>__{(his hand gestures to patel and azad)}
<D>__{if that is what you want, we will accept it. but out there}
<P>__{(he indicates the streets)}
<D>__{already there is rioting because hindus fear you are going to give too much away.}
<C>__{patel}
<D>__{if you did this, no one could control it. no one.}
<A>__{it bears the stamp of undeniable truth. gandhi's eyes sag with the despair of a man whose last hope, whose faith, has crumbled around him. jinnah smiles cynically, he spreads his hands "see?"}
<C>__{jinnah}
<D>__{it is your choice. do you want an independent india and an independent pakistan? or do you want civil war?}
<A>__{gandhi stares at him numbly. the red fort new delhi exterior day on a platform in the foreground mountbatten and nehru. a band plays the indian national anthem loudly and there is the roar of a tremendous crowd as the green, white and saffron flag of india is raised on the flagpole. government building karachi exterior day on a platform in the foreground jinnah and a british plenipotentiary. a band plays the new pakistani national anthem loudly and there is the roar of a tremendous crowd as the white, green with white crescent, flag of pakistan is raised on the flagpole. the ashram exterior day silence. the little flagpole is empty, the rope dangling, flapping loosely down the pole. gandhi sits on the porch of his bungalow, spinning. the hum of the spinning wheel. inside we can just see mirabehn, spinning too. but apart from that, he is alone; the whole ashram seems deserted. we hear the sound of a bell on one of the goats, fairly distant. the path to the ashram exterior day featuring kallenbach. he is taking the goat and tethering it near the path of the ashram. he stills the bell with his hand. as he ties it the camera angle widens and we see margaret bourke white sitting on the grass, watching kallenbach and looking off toward gandhi's bungalow.}
<D>__{bourke white aren't you being a little overprotective?}
<A>__{kallenbach looks at her. her tone criticizes more than his stilling the goat's bell.}
<C>__{kallenbach}
<D>__{tomorrow. tomorrow photograph him. bourke white i came all this way because i believed the picture of independence day was of him here alone.}
<A>__{kallenbach stands and looks across at her, judging, then appealing to her humanity.}
<C>__{kallenbach}
<D>__{it is violence, and the fear of violence, that have made today what it is... give him the dignity of his grief.}
<A>__{bourke white grabs a clump of grass, twists it free, and sighs. she tosses the grass vaguely at the goat.}
<D>__{bourke white and while we're sitting here feeding goats, what will happen to all the muslims in india and the hindus in pakistan?}
<A>__{kallenbach stops, staring absently at the ground ahead, then}
<C>__{kallenbach}
<D>__{gandhi will pray for them...}
<A>__{open terrain and railroad exterior day the camera is high (helicopter) and moving and from its position we meet and then pass over an immense column of refugees ten, twenty abreast moving down one side of the railroad track toward camera. women, children, the sick, the aged, all burdened with bedding, utensils, household treasures, useless bric a brac and trudging with them every type of cart, wagon, rickshaw, pulled by donkey, camel, bike, oxen. it stretches endlessly to the horizon. tiny green, white and saffron flags here and there indicate that it is a hindu column and spotted through it we see people in fresh bandages, some on stretchers, sticking out like radioactive tracers in the huge artery of frightened humanity. and the camera lifts and tilts, slowly swinging to the opposite direction, and as it does, reveals another vast column across the track, several yards away, moving in the opposite direction: veiled women in purdah, the crescent flag of muslim pakistan here and there. as the camera levels and speeds along it, we see that this column too reaches to the horizon, that it too carries its wounded. an unbelievable flood of desperate humanity.}
