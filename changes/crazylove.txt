<LOC>__{INT. BEDROOM - APARTMENT - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The sweet silence of slumber. Suddenly, an alarm clock on a nightstand SHRIEKS the operatic tones of Maria Callas. A well-manicured hand, nails painted pink, slaps the snooze button and mutes Maria. A few seconds reprieve. Then, another clock, stationed on a dresser, broadcasts the FORTISSIMO POUNDING of the "William Tell Overture." Toes, also painted pink, swing out of bed and run to the dresser. LETTY MAYER, late 20s and beautiful, turns off the music. She opens a dresser drawer and surveys panties that are arranged by color, from white to beige to black. Behind the panties are rows of bras, also organized by color. Letty pulls out some taupe undergarments, checks them against her nails and replaces them in favor of a pink bra and panties. Letty goes to her closet and removes a tailored, pink linen suit. She lays it on the bed. Beast, her cat, jumps on the bed and settles into the jacket. Letty swoops the animal off her clothes and brushes cat hair from the suit.}
<CHAR>__{LETTY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Listen, Beast. What have I told you about linen?}
<ACTION>__{The scolding is cut short by an "Urge Overkill" song that SCREAMS OUT from another room. On cue, Letty heads down the hall, dressing as she goes. She CLUCKS for Beast to follow.}
<LOC>__{INT. KITCHEN - SAME}
<ACTION>__{Letty turns off the alarm clock that BLASTS "Urge Overkill" from the counter and checks the time against her watch. She swings open a cupboard to look at cans of cat food arranged by type. Seafood on the left, chicken in the middle, then, naturally, beef. Letty reaches for a can.}

<ACTION>__{Letty hurries down the hall and turns off the clock, which is mounted near the front door. She bends down to kiss the cat good-bye, grabs a briefcase and leaves.}

<ACTION>__{A school bell BUZZES. Grade-schoolers, clutching lunch pails, scurry past Letty, who stands outside an office door. She straightens her jacket, takes a deep breath and starts to turn the handle. Letty is stopped cold when CHANDRA, 7, the victim of a bloody nose, runs up to her, bawling.}
