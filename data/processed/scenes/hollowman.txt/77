<L>__{interior recovery chamber day}
<A>__{in a dusty shaft of light... a cotton swab. is dipped by a gloved hand into a jar of flesh colored cream make up. we follow the hand as it raises the cotton swab into the darkness. the swab strokes over the black and the rich fleshy cream spreads, revealing... eye lids of a closed eye. the eyelids part, unveiling... pitch black. blink. blink. no eye. not even a trace of a eye socket. just darkness. a colored contact lens floats through mid air... hovering before the eyelids. it turns and fastens itself to the darkness between the lids. we pull back slowly as sebastian lifts a latex face mask and pulls it over his head. he checks his reflection in the mirror. he looks almost human. almost. a face, eyes, hands ... the rest of him covered by surgical scrubs. we pull back and see the rest of the team looking on.}

<D>__{not too bad.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{the latex'll limit the amount of light delivered to my optic nerves.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{you could almost pass for human.}
<A>__{sebastian rises. he looks eerily removed from reality with his cold blank expression.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{well, it gives you a face to talk to at least, and we can all work in normal light again.}
