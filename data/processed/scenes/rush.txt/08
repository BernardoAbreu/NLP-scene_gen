<A>__{over this: the sound of a ringing phone...}
<L>__{interior hospital a&e unit (accident and emergency) day}
<A>__{we're in a busy hospital a&e unit. noise. crowds. a regular saturday late afternoon. the phone continues to ring.. finally, an attractive station nurse in her 20's, run off her feet, breathlessly picks up the phone.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{emergency...}
<A>__{she covers her ears, straining to hear, listening to what is being said. then her expression changes...}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{okay...standing by!}
<A>__{the nurse hangs up...then calls out to her nurse and doctor colleagues...}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{that was the race track..! there's been an accident..! a driver's been injured and is on his way in..!}
<A>__{instantly the atmosphere changes. a hive of activity as doctors and nurses prepare themselves for a major trauma... all patients with minor injuries are cleared out of the way. the nurse rings upstairs to the operating theatres and consultant surgeons, telling them to stand by... caption: "eighty eight races earlier" swing doors open, and a pair of shoeless, bare feet walks through and into the accident and emergency unit. camera tilts up a pair of long legs in white racing overalls...to reveal a tall, good looking driver, james hunt, (mid 20's), tanned, athletic, surfer long blonde hair... a man about whom a word comes to mind one would rarely use to describe an englishman. sexy. blood trickles from his nose, there is bruising to his lip and the formation (already) of a nasty black eye, but make no mistake. he rocks. drop dead gorgeous..}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{i think the racetrack telephoned ahead that i was coming? hunt? james hunt..?}
<A>__{james notices all the nurses staring..}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{what's the matter? no one seen a spot of blood before?}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{are you all right?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{absolutely fine.}
