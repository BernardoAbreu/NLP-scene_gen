<A>__{a stadium sized dome (cgi set extension) imagine a domed sports arena this is the scope and scale of the space that mulder has penetrated. we see him as only a small speck on a balcony midway between floor and ceiling. pulling himself out of the balcony passageway, which is like countless other passageways. which are actually ventilation ports.}
<B>__{angle over mulder}
<A>__{pulling himself to his feet. beholding the space before him. looking down to the center floor where a large central theater gives off a light different from elsewhere in the dome. an icy, bright glow. leading down to the central theater far below are several large tubular spokes. (one of which leads up right next to mulder's position.)}
<B>__{angle on mulder}
<A>__{reacting to this. then something captures his attention. mulder's pov there on the floor, far down below, is the bubble litter scully was transported in. (note scully's clothes are still in the bubble litter.) standing out as a rather human artifact against the otherwise dull gray bulwarks and architecture surrounding it.}
