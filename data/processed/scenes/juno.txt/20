<L>__{interior dancing elk school science lab day}
<A>__{students bustle in, as the teacher, mr. tinker tries to maintain order. juno heads toward her desk and sets down her bag.}
<C>__{mr. tinker}
<D>__{people! we're doing our photomagnetism lab today, so find your partner and break out into fours.}
<A>__{juno looks up and meets eyes with her longtime lab partner: bleeker. sound the gong of awkwardness! juno and bleeker head separately over to an available lab station and unpack their bags in silence.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{well! nothing like experimenting.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{i did the prep questions for this lab last night. you can copy my answers if you need to.}
<A>__{he slides a piece of graph paper in front of juno without looking at her.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{oh, i couldn't copy your work.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{but you copy my work every week.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{oh yeah. i'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{i don't mind. you definitely bring something to the table.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{charisma?}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{or something.}
<A>__{the other two lab partners, a humorless couple, join them at the station.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{so, who's ready for some photomagnificence?}
<C>__{girl lab partner}
<D>__{i have a menstrual migraine, and i can't look at bright lights today.}
<C>__{guy lab partner}
<D>__{amanda, i told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. you never listen.}
<C>__{girl lab partner}
<D>__{no josh, i don't take orders. not from you and not from any man.}
<C>__{guy lab partner}
<D>__{you know, you've been acting like this ever since i went up to see my brother at mankato. i told you, nothing happened!}
<C>__{girl lab partner}
<D>__{something happened. because your eyes? are very cold? they're very cold, josh. they're cold, lying eyes.}
<C>__{guy lab partner}
<D>__{what? my eyes are not lying!}
<C>__{girl lab partner}
<D>__{yes they are, josh. since mankato, they have been lying eyes.}
<A>__{juno and bleeker observe the argument like tennis spectators, fascinated by the dynamics of a real couple.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{okay... i'm going to set up the apparatus. juno, want to get a c clamp out of that drawer?}
<C>__{girl lab partner}
<D>__{i'm going to the infirmary.}
<C>__{guy lab partner}
<D>__{good. call me when you're off the rag.}
<C>__{girl lab partner}
<D>__{fine. call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four smirnoff ices and a bottle of snow peak peach flavored boone's!}
<C>__{guy lab partner}
<D>__{good, i will be sure to do that, amanda. i will make a note of it.}
<A>__{he furiously scrawls a fake memo in his notebook.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{snow peak peach is the best flavor of boone's. right, bleek?}
<A>__{bleeker reddens and continues constructing the apparatus. girl lab partner stalks off dramatically. bleeker shakes his head and rifles through his textbook.}
