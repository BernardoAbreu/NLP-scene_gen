<A>__{the pale light grows. thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold, clear air. somewhere an dog barks. an old woman comes out of one of the huts. she carries a pail. she swirls it and tosses the dirty water onto the ground. as she goes back inside the hut, a tusken child runs past, dragging a stick in the sand. the child runs through the line of huts, turns a corner, and stops suddenly, staring at the bodies of the two tusken guards. between them, anakin stands outside the hut door. his face is a grim mask. the child stares, then there is a flash of light as anakins lightsaber switches on.}
