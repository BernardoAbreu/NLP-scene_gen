<L>__{exterior texas highway the next day}
<A>__{the black lincoln town car is parked on a lonely stretch of prairie highway. wesley sits in the passenger seat with the door open. the radio is on. charlie is on his cell phone nearby.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{no, we don't know where she is... i understand... no, we'll find her...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i understand.}
<A>__{he hangs up and looks out at the horizon, where huge black storm clouds are gathering. then he walks slowly to the hood of the car, staring at the ground in front of his feet.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{what'd they say? can we go back to detroit?}
<A>__{charlie rests his hands gently on the hood, as if considering buying the car. wesley's music bangs from the radio.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{they said find it. find her, find it. finish the job you were paid to do.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{half.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{they paid us half. they still owe us half...}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{there it is again. that lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. that "make a statement," do an end zone dance, shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that's dragging this whole country down the drain.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{they don't owe us shit, wesley! when you finish the job, you get paid!! we haven't finished the goddamn job!!}
<A>__{charlie pounds on the hood of the car, scaring wesley.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{that woman could be in any one of four states. four big states where the deer and the antelope play, wesley! we're not in rhode island!}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{i know that.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{and turn that fucking music off!}
<A>__{wesley switches it off. charlie turns his back to the car and addresses the angry clouds on the horizon.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{do i deserve this? in the twilight of my career, do i deserve this? i don't think so! i've always tried to do what's right. i never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. i'm a professional!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and where the fuck am i? i'm in purgatory!}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{worse... you're in texas.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well, i should be in florida now! if carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and i'd be on my way to the keys. on my boat, relaxing with a glass of port!! re ti red!}
<A>__{the first raindrops begin to fall.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{i'm very tired, wesley! i've worked hard, and the work should be over, but it's not! this job is just beginning.}
<P>__{(he turns around)}
<D>__{get in the car!}
<A>__{wesley is in the car, but he's too scared to tell charlie, whose eyes are blazing. charlie silently walks around to the driver's side and gets in. he and wesley stare at each other over a photo of betty, which is between them on the dash. charlie starts the engine and snatches up the picture.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{what're you thinking, girl? what's going on in that pretty little mind of yours? huh? you can tell me...}
<A>__{he paws at the picture, imploringly. he mutters to himself. wesley shakes his head and stares out.}
