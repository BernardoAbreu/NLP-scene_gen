<L>__{interior living room early morning}
<A>__{as billy enters, looks around.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{ted kramer, still fully dressed, looking like the wrath of god is asleep in the chair.}
<B>__{on billy}
<A>__{as he marches across to his father.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{where's mommy?}
<B>__{on ted}
<A>__{his eyes open, he looks around startled.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{huh?... oh god... what time is it?}
<A>__{cross cutting between them:}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(suspicious)}
<D>__{the little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. where is mommy?}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(trying to pull himself together)}
<D>__{oh, christ... ah, yeah... you want to know why mom's not here, right?}
<A>__{billy nods.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(bullshit)}
<D>__{okay, i'm going to tell you... it's like this. mommy and daddy had a little argument and mommy decided she wanted to go off by herself for a little while. you know how sometimes you get mad and want to go off and be by yourself? well, it's like that, okay? okay.}
<P>__{(subject closed)}
<D>__{now how about some breakfast?}
<A>__{ted struggles to his feet and the camera tracks with them as they start toward the kitchen.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{when is mommy coming back?}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(lying)}
<D>__{soon. very soon.}
<A>__{by now they are inside the kitchen, ted looks around.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{there, on the kitchen cabinet is a box of "natural grain" cereal, a jar of honey, some wheat germ, and a banana, with carefully written instructions from joanna underneath.}
<B>__{on ted}
<A>__{he takes one look at the note, crumples it up and tosses it in the wastebasket.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(the camp counselor)}
<D>__{i will tell you what, kiddo why don't i fix us some french toast?}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{wow! french toast, really?}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(the camp counselor)}
<D>__{sure. didn't i ever tell you french toast was my specialty? i will bet i never told you that. now then, the first thing we need is...}
<P>__{(trying desperately to remember)}
<D>__{...eggs! right?}
<A>__{billy nods. ted opens the refrigerator and takes some eggs.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{this is terrific... isn't this terrific?}
<A>__{as ted begins the process of making french toast, it soon becomes obvious that he has no idea of what he is doing. what follows is a symphony in incompetence on ted's part. he breaks the eggs into a bowl and ends up with most of the shell mixed up with the egg. then he takes a piece of bread and drops it into bowl.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(saying it will make it so)}
<D>__{i'm having a good time... are you having a good time?}
<B>__{on billy}
<A>__{watching all of this with increasing apprehension.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{you forgot the milk.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(still the camp counselor)}
<D>__{that's right. you're absolutely right... it's been a long time since i made french toast.}
<A>__{ted takes a container of milk, pours it into the bowl so that it is filled to the brim. then he sloshes the bread around until it is half dissolved.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{look at this, isn't this something?!}
<A>__{he lops off a huge hunk of butter, drops it into an omelet pan and turns up the flame.}
<B>__{on billy}
<A>__{watching. he looks as though he is about to throw up.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{what about my orange juice?}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(the counterman)}
<D>__{right. one o.j. coming up.}
<A>__{he opens the refrigerator and starts to get the orange juice. as he does, black smoke begins to billow ominously from the frying pan.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(scared)}
<D>__{daddy!!!}
<A>__{ted turns, spots the smoke.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{don't worry... everything's fine...}
<A>__{he lunges for the handle of the frying pan, which by now is very hot. he grabs it, lets out a howl of pain and the whole mess, frying pan, butter, bread, goes crashing to the floor.}
<B>__{close on ted}
<A>__{suddenly all the rage comes pouring out.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{goddam! son of a bitch!}
<B>__{reaction billy}
<A>__{terrified.}
<B>__{wide shot}
<A>__{as ted kneels down and begins to clean up the mess.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(to himself as much as to billy)}
<D>__{it's okay. it's gonna be okay...}
<A>__{everything's going to be all right.}
