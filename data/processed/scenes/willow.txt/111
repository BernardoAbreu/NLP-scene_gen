<A>__{the nockmaar horsemen race out of the cave and gallop up the obsidian mountain toward the dark castle. the army of tir asleen thunders out of the cave in pur suit. arrows fire back and forth. the tir asleen army stays right on the enemy's tail. willow hangs on to madmar tigan for dear life. airk and madmartigan ride side by side, perfect team work, and cut a few nockmaar ment down. then madmartigan turns and sees sorsha ride up past everybody. what a rider she is! she surprises a cou ple of nockmaar soldiers, swordfighting as she rides, killing them both. but she can't catche kael. he rides ahead of everyone else, whipping his horse at an in credible speed toward the castle. the chase continues up the mountain. the tir asleen army keeps firing arrows at the enemy, or cutting them down with their swords, until only two nockmaar men ride behind kael. at last kael reaches the castle drawbridge and leaps onto it as it begins to rise. his two remaining horsemen leap after him but fall short and tumble into the dry craggy moat. the drawbridge shuts with a loud echoing klungg! mad martigan and arik screech to a halt on the brink of the moat. they look up. the castle loom, huge, dark, powerful, evil.}
