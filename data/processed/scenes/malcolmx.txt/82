<L>__{interior prison chapel night}
<A>__{title 6 years later a group of prisoners, mostly white, but with a goodly smattering of black convicts, are listening to a lecture by chaplain gill.}
<C>__{chaplain gill}
<D>__{are there any questions?}
<A>__{angle. malcolm seated next to a black convict, raises his hand. it's the only hand up. the chaplain searches for another questioner, but there aren't any. pete, sitting next to malcolm, whispers.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{watch out, baby, this cat is heavy on religion.}
<C>__{chaplain gill}
<D>__{i see this has become a struggle between good and evil. satan has a question.}
<A>__{there is laughter from the convicts.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{yes it is, chaplain gill. but i wouldn't want to say which one of us is what.}
<A>__{laughter, especially from the black convicts.}
<C>__{chaplain gill}
<D>__{why don't you just ask your question?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you've been talking about the disciples. what color were they?}
<C>__{chaplain gill}
<D>__{i don't think we know for certain.}
<A>__{there are reactions from the convicts. malcolm is sharply challenging a white man about color.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{they were hebrew, weren't they?}
<C>__{chaplain gill}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{as jesus was. jesus was also a hebrew.}
<C>__{chaplain gill}
<D>__{just what is your question?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what color were the original hebrews?}
<C>__{chaplain gill}
<D>__{i told you we don't know for certain.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{then we don't know that god was white.}
<A>__{there is a strong reaction to this.}
<C>__{chaplain gill}
<D>__{now just a moment, just a moment }
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{but we do know that the people of that region of asia minor, from the tigris euphrates valley to the mediterranean, are dark skinned people. i've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. i have never seen a native of that area who was not black.}
<C>__{chaplain gill}
<D>__{just what are you saying?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i'm not saying anything, preacher. i'm proving to you that god is black.}
<A>__{insert flash a blond, blue eyed jesus on the cross (note: try to get footage from _the last temptation of christ_ [willem dafoe])}
<C>__{malcolm's voice}
<D>__{god is black.}
