<A>__{ichabod stands holding a torch, looking up. the whole area is bright from the light off a giant fire. there are broken lanterns and barrels around the agonized, twisted tree. the tree is aflame, fire dancing up the trunk, and through every branch to lick the sky.}
<L>__{exterior forest day}
<A>__{dawn. ichabod is seated overlooking the hudson. he stares at the beauty around him, brooding through bleary eyes. gunpowder is tied to a tree. birds sing. the ledger is open in ichabod's lap. he thumbs pages absently, just keeps staring off.}
