<L>__{exterior alley night}
<A>__{corky's truck sits in a gravel parking lot.}
<L>__{interior corky's truck day}
<A>__{through the back window of the truck, violet and corky are silhouettes against the street light.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{caesar is going to get the money and bring }
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{how much money?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{shelly said it was over two million dollars.}
<A>__{corky quietly swallows that pill. it begins to rain.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |shelly's books to figure out how he did it.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{wait a minute. wait a minute. do you have any idea what you are saying? you are asking me to help you fuck the mob.}
<A>__{violet nods.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{these people are serious, violet. if you want to know how serious, ask shelly. they're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules. you fuck them, you've got to do it right.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{that's why i need your help. you said you were good.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i am, but ...}
<A>__{she knows violet is challenging her.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{all right, let's say for the moment that i believe everything you are saying.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you think i'm lying?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are. it would have been easy to set shelly up. you could have got him killed knowing that caesar would bring the money to the apartment.}
<A>__{violet stares, her face poker blank.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{all you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{is that what you think?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i'm just making a pointerior you have no idea what you're asking. how much trust two people need to do something like this.}
<A>__{she moves closer to violet, the sound of the rain beating against the metal cab.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{for me, stealing is a lot like sex. two people that want the same thing sit in a room and they talk, they start to plan and it's like flirting, a kind of foreplay, because the more they talk about it, the wetter they get.}
<A>__{she stops.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{the difference is, i can have sex with someone i just met, someone i hardly know, but to steal i need to know someone like i know myself.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{do you think you know me like that?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i think ...}
<A>__{they are close enough to kiss.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{we're going to find out.}
<A>__{corky pulls back.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{but first, i want to see this money.}
