<A>__{a moth flies around the light casting a shadow that floats over everything. suzie turns out the kitchen light and then turns out the dining room light. she goes to her room and closes the door, leaving the room dark. a car headlight passing outside casts a moving pattern that moves along the wall. the light reveals harry's presence standing in the hall doorway.}
