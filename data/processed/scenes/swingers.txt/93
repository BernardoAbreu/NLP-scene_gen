<A>__{trent and sue are involved in a different conversation. they are observing two hot girls at another cocktail table. the girls are wearing short plaid skirts with black stockings pulled up to midthigh. it's the "catholic school girl gone bad" look. the girls are a little too touchy feely with each other, suggesting a certain sexual open mindedness.}
