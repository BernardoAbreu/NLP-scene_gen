<A>__{jack's p.o.v. on the wall is painted a red pentangle (a five pointed star) and on either side burns a yellow candle.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what about it?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's a five pointed star.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{maybe the owners are from texas.}
<A>__{the woman brings them their tea.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to woman)}
<D>__{remember the alamo?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{he was joking. thank you.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{joking? i remember the alamo. i saw it once in london, in leicester square.}
<A>__{jack and david look startled. one of the chess players explains:}
<C>__{chess player}
<D>__{she means in the cinema, that film with john wayne.}
<P>__{(turns to board)}
<D>__{checkmate.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{oh, yes, of course.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{right, with laurence harvey and everybody died in it. it was very bloody.}
<C>__{chess player}
<D>__{bloody awful if you ask me!}
<A>__{this sends everyone into gales of laughter. jack and david smile politely.}
<C>__{chess player}
<D>__{here, gladys, tom. did you hear the one about the crashing plane?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{no, but we're about to.}
<A>__{laughter.}
<C>__{chess player}
<D>__{you be quiet, woman, and let me speak.}

<C>__{woman}
<D>__{oh, come on, tell us.}
<C>__{chess player}
<D>__{no. you've had your chance.}
<A>__{the men all coax him to tell the joke.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to david)}
<D>__{ask them what the candles are for.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{you ask them.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to david)}
<D>__{listen, that's a pentangle, a five pointed star. it's used in witchcraft. lon chaney, jr. and universal studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{i see. you want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to david)}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{wrong.}
<A>__{the drinkers have gotten the chess player to tell the joke as everyone knew he would.}
<C>__{chess player}
<D>__{oh, all right. there was this airplane over the atlantic on its way to new york. it was full of men from the united nations.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{that's very funny, that is.}
<A>__{uproarious laughter.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to david)}
<D>__{go on, ask them.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{you ask them.}
<C>__{chess player}
<D>__{here now, let me finish! so halfway over the ocean the engines run low on petrol so they have to lighten the plane. so they heave out all the baggage, but it's still too heavy. so they chuck out the seats, but it's still too heavy! finally this froggy steps up and shouts "viva la france" and leaps out. then an englishman....}
<C>__{dart players}
<D>__{hear! hear!}
<C>__{chess player}
<P>__{(undaunted)}
<D>__{...steps up and shouts `god save the queen!' and leaps out. but the plane is still too heavy. so the yank delegate from texas steps up, shouts, `remember the alamo!' and chucks out the mexican.}
<A>__{this is apparently the funniest joke the inhabitants of east proctor have ever heard. the laughter is uproarious, choking, knee slapping, incredible. as the chess player goes to take a drink of beer, the dart player gasps out...}
<C>__{dart player}
<D>__{remember the alamo!}
<A>__{...causing the chess player to spit out his beer causing even harder laughter. complete hilarity.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{excuse me, but what's that star on the wall for?}
<A>__{dead silence. a dart lands in the wall. david and jack are understandably bewildered. the villagers look hard indeed.}
<C>__{dart player}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{you've made me miss.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{dart player}
<D>__{i've never missed the board before.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{jack, we'd better go.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what do you mean? i'm starving.}
<C>__{dart player}
<D>__{there's no food here.}
<A>__{the villagers look threatening and david's voice is a bit urgent.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{come on, jack, shall we go?!!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{apparently so.}
<A>__{the boys pick up their backpacks and move uncertainly for the door.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(to men)}
<D>__{you can't let them go.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{how much do we owe you?}
<C>__{chess player}
<D>__{nothing, lads. go, god be with you.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{uh, thank you.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{wait! you just can't let them go!}
<C>__{dart player}
<D>__{go! and stay on the road. keep clear of the moors.}
<C>__{david}
