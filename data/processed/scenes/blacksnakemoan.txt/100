<L>__{interior lazarus' home afternoon}
<A>__{laz enters his home. he crosses to the kitchen and pours himself a glass of water. dripping with sweat, he steps back into the room, downing the last of his water. he lowers the glass, noticing rae looking at him.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{rae lifts her head off the pillow. laz comes to her side and helps her sit up.}
<C>__{lazarus}

<C>__{rae}
<P>__{(can't believe it)}
<D>__{two days?}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{after your fever broke, you'd wake up in spells... long enough to get that medicine in ya.}
<A>__{rae sits up on the couch, the quilt wrapped around her waist. she looks at the cough syrup bottle on the side table.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{found you on the side of the road. someone took to beatin' on you pretty bad. you know who done that to you?}
<A>__{rae touches the cut over her eye. that evening is still a blur.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{where's ronnie?}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{well i don't...}
<C>__{rae}
<P>__{(remembering)}
<D>__{wait. he left.}
<A>__{rae lifts her head, revealing tears in her eyes. she gets mad at herself and wipes them away.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{i don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{don't need none.}
<C>__{rae}

<D>__{naw'sir... i gotta be on my way.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...}
<A>__{rae struggles for balance as she attempts to stand. the quilt falls away as a heavy chain slides off the couch and thuds on the floor by her feet. rae feels a tug. she looks down to see a dark chain locked around her thin waist and coiled on the floor. the opposite end is locked around the side coil of the radiator. she is chained to the house, a prisoner.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{let me say somethin' first...}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{why you got me chained?}
<C>__{lazarus}

<C>__{rae}
<P>__{(yanks at the chain around her waist)}
<D>__{get this goddamn thing off me!}
<A>__{rae stumbles as she moves away from laz. laz tries to reassure her.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{now, no harm's come to you... and i aim to keep it that way. ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. i'd be chasin' you all night.}

<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{gal, you ain't right yet.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{i'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. now take this goddamn chain off...}
<C>__{lazarus}

<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{these men you up under. how you let them do ya like that?}

<C>__{rae}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{the hell you know about me?! you got no right to talk to me about that shit! the hell you think you are?}
<C>__{lazarus}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{i've saved ya life, gal. i can do and say whatever the fuck i want.}
<A>__{rae begins to feel a pang of panic. she goes to the chain locked around the radiator. she yanks on it a few times.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{i give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. get you to the kitchen. you need the bathroom, it'll reach.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{we got everything we need. plenty of food. ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{what do you want from me?!}
<P>__{(laz can't answer)}
<D>__{whatever you gonna do to me, just do it! and let me go!}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{god saw to it to put you in my path. and i aim to cure ya of your wickedness.}
<A>__{this statement terrifies rae. the fear can be seen in her eyes. she backs away the chain scrapes across the floor.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{you some kind'a pervert?}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{no ma'am.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{some crazy jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...}

<D>__{look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. i will do whatever you want. but you gotta let me go. you can't do this! you can't keep me here!}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{you sick. you got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.}
<A>__{rae pushes laz back and bolts for the door. laz falls back against the side table by the couch, toppling the lamp.}
