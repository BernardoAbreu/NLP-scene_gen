<A>__{aline sits at her computer, checking out 3 d scans of the four abkani artifacts. she is running an analysis the symbols carved into each artifact. streams of calculations run across the screen as the computer processes. the computer beeps as it comes to a conclusion. the symbols correlate to constellations in the night sky. aline hits copy on her computer and it burns a cd of the information she has processed. aline searches through a roll of maps. she pulls out a map of north america and lays it out on a work station. aline draws lines across the map, trying to pinpoint a location based on the constellations. she marks the map up with latitude and longitude calculations. she stops. she looks back up at the computer screen. she taps her pen on the map. she looks frustrated.}
