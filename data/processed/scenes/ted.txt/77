<L>__{interior john and lori's living room day}
<A>__{john sits on the couch, putting his tie on as he watches tv. lori comes over and sits down next to him.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{hey there.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{listen... i just wanna say thank you. what you did with ted was a big step, and i know it wasn't easy, but i just want you to know that i love you for it. and, i think this a new beginning for our relationship.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hey, anything for you. this is all part of the new grown up, adult john bennett. so, get used to him.}
<A>__{she gives him a kiss, and starts to undo his tie.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{y'know, i don't have to be at work for another twenty minutes...}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(guiding her down onto the couch)}
<D>__{ooh, that's perfect, i'm only gonna need one.}
<A>__{she laughs, and they kiss.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{you know what my favorite thing about you is? after four years, you can still surprise me. to step up and change such a big part of your life just to make your girlfriend happier... i dunno, i bet you most guys couldn't do it.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{most guys don't have you to motivate `em.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{i'm sorry if i was pushy about it...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no, you were right! look, the reason i love you so much is the same reason i guess i take you for granted sometimes. it's `cause you're... inevitable.}
<C>__{lori}
<P>__{(huh?)}
<D>__{inevitable. well, that's... romantic? i think?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no, what i mean is, there's just no version of this universe where you and i don't end up together. you're inevitable.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{that sounds like something stephen hawking would say to his girlfriend.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{but do you get what i'm saying?}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{yeah, i do. and i feel exactly the same way about you.}
<A>__{they kiss.}
<C>__{lori }
<P>__{(smiling coyly, as she notices)}
<D>__{ooh. is that a flash gordon ray gun in your pocket or are you glad to see me?}
<A>__{john pulls the flash gordon gun out of his pocket and shows it to her. she cracks up.}
