<L>__{exterior vacant lot night}
<A>__{a rusty chain link fence separates the lot from the boule vard. choked with weeds. broken glass. a rusted out car. a towering billboard looms overhead, inviting people to drink scotch or get laid, it's hard to tell. hallenbeck staggers drunkenly across the lot. the crag faced man follows behind him.}
<P>__{crag face (hitman #2)}
<D>__{wrong place at the wrong time, buddy, that's all it is. just want you to know it's nothing personal.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{that's what you think. last night i fucked your wife.}
<A>__{the gunman cracks up. hallenbeck grins drunkenly.}
<D>__{crag face oh, you did, huh? how'd you know it was my wife?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{she said her husband was a greaseball with bad breath.}
<A>__{the guy cracks up again.}
<D>__{crag face you're pretty cool for a guy gonna take a bullet.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{after fucking your wife, i will take two.}
<A>__{the hitman wheezes laughter. joe just grins.}
<D>__{crag face you're a funny guy. it's a shame to take you off. here, kneel down.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{are you kidding? we barely know each other.}
<A>__{the hitman is now giggling, shaking his head.}
<D>__{crag face this is wild. i never shot no funny guy before.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{you need a special funny bullet. crag face come on, cut it out. head or chest?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{that's what your wife said. crag face would you quit with the wife? enough is enough.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{ask me how fat she is. crag face how fat is she?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{she's so fat i had to roll her in flour and look for the wet spot. you wanna fuck her, you gotta slap her thigh and ride the wave in.}
<P>__{(the hitman loses it)}
<D>__{like the pillsbury doughboy, except when you poke her in the stomach, she farts. i got a buddy he's an archaeologist, organized an expedition to her chin. they got lost in her nasal hair. but seriously, her eyes are like the streets of paris: crossed. they're so crossed when she cries the tears run down her back. she's got back tearia. crag face}
<P>__{(can't stop laughing)}
<D>__{oh, that's awful. buddy, you're a fucking rio }
<A>__{from a kneeling position, hallenbeck flings a handful of gravel at the man's eyes. the man cries out. stumbles backward. and hallenbeck moves like a coiled spring. not drunk at all. he takes the broken bottle he's been clutching and cuts the guy's throat like a knife through butter. the hitman stands with a shocked look on his face. blood bubbling. fires the gun once, into the ground. drops it from nerve less fingers. stares at hallenbeck, aghast.}
<D>__{crag face bastard.}
<A>__{hallenbeck meets his gaze. a savage, feral gleam in his eye.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{and then some.}
<A>__{the guy pitches over dead. hallenbeck kneels beside him. retrieves his .38, holsters it. slips the hitman's pistol into his waistband.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{i'm playing tahoe on the 15th.}
<A>__{he takes off running.}
