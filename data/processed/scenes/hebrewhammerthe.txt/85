<A>__{it's the kind of place where a giant telescope at an observatory would be housed. the clock is breathtaking in its size. on its face, in place of the standard numerals are the names of jewish holidays. for example, "yom kipur" is where the twelve should be, followed by "passover", etc. in the center of the face, an odometer like gauge reveals the year '5734.' at its base, the brilliant blue judeum glows brightly. santa barks out orders.}
