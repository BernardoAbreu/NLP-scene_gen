<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior church day}
<A>__{the renewal of vows is over, and sharon is standing in the aisle, nervous and not sure what to do. guests are up and milling about, many leaving the church. "see you at the house." "see you at the party." etc. a photographer is setting a group shot at the front of the church. mr. and mrs. pogue, larry and kathy and the little boy...}
<C>__{photographer}
<D>__{all right. the whole family in this one. just...}
<A>__{out of the milling crowd comes sharon, taking a breath and braving it, walking up there, speaking quietly.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{where do you want me?}
<A>__{the photographer turns to her, wondering.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i'm the daughter.}
<C>__{photographer}
<D>__{oh! oh, well, how about...}
<A>__{we see the family shift so that larry and his family are on one side of the parents. sharon follows the photographer's gesture to stand at the other side, beside her mother. her father has not looked at her. the photo is taken. sharon now turns to her mom and dad. this is difficult, the strain is thick in the air.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{you both look so great.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{you, too.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i just wanted to...}
<A>__{the father speaks to her, his voice not hard, but flat, not warm either. no smile.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{you coming to the party?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{he nods, then turns to greet well wishers. sharon is left alone by the drifting away of the family, but one old couple greets her, the older woman (mrs. vander) wearing her new blue dress, her husband beaming beside her.}
<C>__{mrs. vander}
<D>__{sherry! look how nice you look.}
<C>__{husband}
<D>__{big police officer now.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{not so big.}
<P>__{(to mrs. vander)}
<D>__{nice dress.}
<A>__{sharon moves off toward a side exit, trying to catch up with larry and his family.}
