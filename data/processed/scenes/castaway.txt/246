<L>__{exterior raft day moments later}
<A>__{chuck lies back on the raft. he is humming.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{what are you smiling about? they'll be back.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{i'm dancing on the roof of the peabody hotel. with kelly.}
<A>__{he smiles at the thought.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{the music ends. we go back to the table. the waiters have brought dinner. new york strip with bordelaise sauce. mushrooms in brown gravy. roasted potatoes with garlic and rosemary. green beans with almonds. fresh biscuits and cornbread, dripping with butter. a nice salad with ranch dressing. a jumbo shrimp cocktail.}
<A>__{thinks about that, it spoils the picture.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{no shrimp.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{we eat.}
<A>__{he closes his eyes. this is the greatest fantasy.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<P>__{(as the waiter)}
<D>__{for dessert, we have pecan pie a la mode, we have a double chocolate cake with creme anglaise, we have a nice pear torte, fresh key lime pie, or perhaps if you care to wait a few minutes, a grand marnier souffle?}
<A>__{chuck thinks over the options, thinking of each one.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{why, bring them all, bring them all.}
<A>__{he rolls over. there, square in his vision, is a ship, its form coming in and out of a low haze. chuck jumps to his feet. waves. screams.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{here! over here!}
<A>__{the ship moves on. we can see the decks the rigging, the vastness of it. chuck realizes he is naked. struggles to pull on the remains of his pants finally holds them like a diaper with one hand as he continues to wave. on the ship no one is to be seen. it is a spooky sight. the big tanker moves on. we are on chuck's face. passed up again. then he realizes what is about to happen. he throws out the sea anchor. he throws himself onto the raft and grips it as tight as he can, wiggles his feet into the ropes.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{oh, shiiiittt!}
<A>__{then comes the wake of the ship. it rocks the raft like a piece of flotsam. the raft rides high up on the wave, then shoots down it, but the sea anchor holds, and the raft slows and rides along with the wave. and then the sea is calm again. slowly chuck sinks to his knees. his hand lets loose his pants. he lies down on the raft and imagines the conversation with the ship's captain.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{permission to come aboard, sir. chuck captain permission granted.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{may i ask, where are you bound? chuck captain san francisco. and you?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{as it happens, i'm headed for frisco myself. chuck captain would you do us the honor of joining us? we're just sitting down at mess. pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh baked bread, apple pie...}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{no please, join me. some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on.}
<A>__{the depression comes back again.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{they're never going to see you. you're just another piece of trash in the ocean.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{they're on autopilot.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{they're always on autopilot. or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave. they'll never see you.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{damn it! don't be so negative!}
<A>__{chuck picks up wilson.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{wilson, what's your story?}
<A>__{he holds wilson close to his chest.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{i float. you sink. end of story.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{i'm serious. i'm always going on about me, me, me. enough about me. your turn.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{it's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{shut up.}
<A>__{he lies on the raft and holds wilson close. we move up until we see }
