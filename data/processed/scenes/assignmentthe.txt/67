<D>__{carlos' father abandoned him and his mother because he wanted to be a playboy. your father abandoned you in effect, when he was sent to prison. either way, it's a lonely child missing his father. i want you to take what you know of your real father and superimpose it onto this the image of carlos' father, so when you talk of one you are talking of the other with the same emotion... the same love, the same resentment... the same sadness, the same anger.}
