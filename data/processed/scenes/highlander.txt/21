<A>__{a lonely, ancient room full of equal parts dust and oaken study tables. the department supervisor sits at his desk surrounded by a handful of his staff researchers brenna included. a faded, stern portrait of some forgotten curator presides over propped up feet, cold coffee, and half eaten sack lunches.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{i don't believe him.}
<C>__{supervisor}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{he's too cool. too sharp. i think he's got something to do with it. researcher #1 oh, has your penetrating research on 9th century lithuanian dildos suddenly made you an expert on the criminal mentality?}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{screw off, larry.}
<A>__{the men, laugh. they delight in baiting her. researcher #2 opens a budweiser and pours the beer into a medieval mug he's borrowed from the collection.}
<D>__{researcher #2 the cops bought it. they let him go.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{what could they hold him for? i think they're just waiting for something concrete before they haul him in for real. we should look into it. he had to have gotten that sword from somewhere.}
<C>__{supervisor}
<D>__{hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, i'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{i've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved. it's just a hunk of peasant iron. why would he be carrying it around in an alley? researcher #1 here we go. everytime there's a murder in town we have to put up with junior d.a. researcher #2 must be genetic.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{someone should check him out. maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over. he has one, he might have two.}
<C>__{supervisor}
<D>__{you see that desk? _your_ desk? you see the crap piled up on it?}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{give it a rest ned, huh? researcher #2 might be interesting to see what his family connections are. that's a hell of a piece to be just chuck ing around in an alley.}
<C>__{supervisor}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{i swear to god brenna, between you and thompson's novels i'm going to get a bloody ulcer.}
<A>__{researcher #2 lifts the mug of beer to his mouth.}
