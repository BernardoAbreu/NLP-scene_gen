<C>__{jay}
<D>__{and these aren't my drugs i just sell them.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{the difference is you exploit a weakness.}

<D>__{a dollar sixty nine, plus tax.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{at food city it's ninety nine cents, plus tax.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{so.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{so why do you sell it for so much more? i will tell you why because people come here and they're like "a dollar eighty for soda? i should get it at food city. but i don't feel like driving there. i will just buy it here so i don't have to drive up there." that's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{hey, man, what happened with that old guy?}

<D>__{i don't know dude. that caitlin chick's nice. but i see that veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. she brings you food, she rubs your back...didn't i see her change your tire one day?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i jacked the car up. all she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{damn. she sure goes out of her way.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{she's my girlfriend.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{shit, my grandma used to say, "which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." no, wait. i fucked up. she said "what's a good looking plate with nothing on it?"}

<A>__{exit jay. silent bob stands there.}
<C>__{silent bob}
<D>__{you know, there's a million fine looking women in the world, but they don't all bring you lasagne at work. most of them just cheat on you.}
<A>__{silent bob leaves. dante shuts his eyes tightly and rubs the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger, as if in deep concentration. he suddenly snaps his eyes open.}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(nearly surprised)}
<D>__{he's right. i love her.}
