<A>__{grounds grunts. suddenly there's an o.s. sound. both jump up.}
<C>__{hunt}
<D>__{who's that?}
<A>__{breakenridge steps from the shadows, winchester at his shoulder, squinting through the dark with his spectacles.}
<C>__{breakenridge}
<D>__{it's deputy breakenridge.}
<A>__{they relax and lower their pistols, heaving sighs of relief.}
<C>__{hunt}
<D>__{sister boy! thank god, we was afraid }
<C>__{breakenridge}
<D>__{you shouldn't've killed mr. fabian. you shouldn't've done that. it was wrong. i'm takin' you both in for it.}

<D>__{don't try it!}
<C>__{grounds}
<D>__{sister boy, just go to hell!}
<A>__{grounds raises his pistol. breakenridge recoils in fright, stumbling backward in the dark, and his rifle accidentally fires. grounds drops like a stone, a look of utter disbelief on his dying face. hunt looks at him in shock then turns on breakenridge, raising his gun and snarling. breakenridge fires again. hunt grabs his midsection, dropping his gun and falling to his knees. he looks up at breakenridge who shrugs timidly:}
<C>__{breakenridge}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{hunt falls over, dead. breakenridge stares at the bodies, hardly believing it himself....}
