<L>__{exterior desert road later}
<A>__{epps and jaeger come up to the road, a small highway. it's eerie; a road in the middle of the desert. quiet. no cars. they just stand and stare at it for a beat.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{a car's got to come along sooner or later. when it does, we jack it.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{how do we do that?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt. when the car stops i run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{why do i have to lie in the road?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{somebody has to.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{yeah, but why me? what if the car doesn't stop?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{then i'm a rich man.}
<A>__{epps sits by the side of the road waiting for a car. the only thing he gets is more quiet. jaeger sits next to him. after a couple of beats:}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{epps.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i want you to know... i don't know. i just think you're a hell of a guy.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{this whole time, you've kept your head. you didn't go money simple like me and wes. you've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here. and you've been fair too. i mean, even after i...you know...}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{threatened to blow my brains out?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{yeah. even after that. you didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now. but i'd say you've been very fair. i just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{don't make so much out of it. only reason i haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because i've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive. believe me; if i had a minute to catch my breath i might have played things the way you and wes had. i'm no better than anybody else. i've just been busier.}
<A>__{they sit a while more. still no car.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{epps?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i'm thinking about taking a trip.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{thought you were going to buy a car.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{still am. there's more gold than i thought, and since there's only two of us now... where should i go?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i've never been anywhere. i wouldn't know where to go. where would you go?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{how the hell should i know?}
<A>__{another long beat. still no car.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{australia.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i'd go to australia. lot of land, not many people. i think after this i'd like to quit people for awhile. and the girls go crazy for brothers down there.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{that's what i hear. don't matter. girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold.}
<A>__{from the distance we hear the faint sound of a car motor. it draws closer and closer. epps and jaeger stand. knowing they're so close to the end of a long adventure they become very business like.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{well, this is it. we get the car, find some americans. we find americans we'll be all right.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we'll make up some kind of lie. they won't find the gold.}
<A>__{epps and jaeger just stand staring at each other as the car draws closer.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{okay. see you in a minute.}
<A>__{jaeger goes out and lays in the car's path. epps goes to hide behind some rocks. the car keeps getting closer and closer. jaeger yells over to epps.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{epps, i don't think he's slowing down.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{he'll slow down.}
<A>__{the car gets closer.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{he's not slowing.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{he's going to slow down.}
<A>__{the car gets closer.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{epps...epps!}
<A>__{the car barrels right for jaeger. forget what epps says, it's not slowing down and jaeger knows it.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{aw, damn!}
<A>__{at the last possible second jaeger rolls out of the way. the car doesn't slow, tearing across the stretch of road where jaeger lay, but swerves to avoid him. the driver loses control for a few seconds and is forced to skid to a halt. epps runs to the car, rips open the driver's door, and presses the muzzle of an assault weapon to his head.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you speak english? do you speak english!?}
<C>__{driver}
<P>__{(frightened)}
<D>__{y yes.}
<A>__{jaeger runs over and jumps in the car. epps gets in behind the driver, keeping the gun pressed to his head.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{where were you going?}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{baghdad.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what's in the other direction?}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{this road, it leads straight to kuwait.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{turn the car around.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{please, i beg of you. the american army is there. i am iraqi. they will kill me.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{nobody's going to hurt you.}
<A>__{epps takes a gold coin from his back and gives it to the driver.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you see that? gold. you take us to the americans, and we'll give you another one. now drive.}
<A>__{the driver turns around the car and starts back in the direction he came. they drive on for awhile, mostly in silence. epps and jaeger are too anxious to have this all over to say much, and the driver is too scared. finally the driver starts to talk.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{you are americans, yes?}
<A>__{neither jaeger or epps answer.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{we didn't not all want this war, do you know? we didn't not all want to invade our brothers and sisters in kuwait. now your army crushes us. so few days, and so many have died. and many fear we will all die. please tell this to your people: we did not want this war.}
<A>__{still jaeger and epps say nothing. outside the car the traffic flowing in the opposite direction gradually gets thicker and thicker.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{i have a brother in our army. when i take you back, will you look for him? if he is still alive, will you look for him and take care of him?}
<A>__{this last bit gets to epps.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{yeah. we'll look for him.}
<A>__{outside the traffic away from kuwait has gotten so thick everything is at a stand still. there are iraqi military vehicles pulling out, as well as a good many civilian cars and trucks. it clogs up both lanes, and envelopes the car. some people try to make their way on foot as it is now much faster.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{look at this.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{iraqis. they are fleeing from kuwait, from your military.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{see if you can't drive around this.}
<A>__{the driver tries to work the car free of the congestion, but he's wedged in, and not going anywhere. from out of the sky swoop down a flight of american f 15e fighter jets. they swing down on the far end of the highway, engines roaring like angry lions. for a second time stands still. everyone on the road stops and looks up at the jets. time starts again, and with a deadly vengeance. the fighter pilots begin to strafe the highway: vehicles and people, civilian and military alike. there is no distinction, only carnage. this is the infamous al jahra highway from basrah to kuwait city that was strafed with deadly accuracy over and over on the last day of the war by american forces. it became known as the highway of death. the huge shells rip a bloody path, shredding cars and trucks, igniting explosions, straight towards the car with epps, jaeger and the driver. with barely seconds to go before they are shot to pieces as well. they dive from the car, epps dragging the driver out, and scramble for cover along the side of the road. the planes turn back for another pass.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{what the hell are they doing? there're civilians in there.}
<A>__{not even thinking about what he's doing jaeger jumps up and screams at the jets.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{don't shoot! don't shoot! they're civilians!}
<A>__{epps jumps up and drags jaeger back down to cover as the shells fram the jets cut dangerously close to them. the jets bank and swoop for another run. epps realizes there is something wrong. he looks around desperately, but doesn't see...there, back in the car!}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{the gold!}
<A>__{epps runs for the car, trying to beat the jets.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{jaeger lunges for epps but misses him. epps snakes his way through the burning hulks towards their car. he dodges, jukes and weaves among shells, shrapnel and explosions that go off all around him. he just makes it to the car, grabbing up the gold, as the fighters once again swing low and cut loose. a wicked hail of shells reigns down. it sets off a series of violent explosions that knocks jaeger off his feet. it takes him a beat to recover. by then the fighters have done their job, and fly off. jaeger stands. he walks towards the road over the plaintive wails of the barely living. the car, the gold, epps... they are essentially disintegrated. as the camera pulls back and up we see that it isn't just their car and epps that are gone. there isn't much of anything left on this road. just death, destruction and bloodshed.}
