<L>__{interior night. thornfield the library.}
<A>__{rochester has lain jane in front of the fire. she forces herself to eat. rochester gives her wine. she sips.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{how are you now?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{much better, sir. i shall be well again soon.}
<A>__{rochester paces away to the fire. he comes back. stoops his head down to jane to kiss her. she turns her head away.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{i know you. you are thinking. talking is no use; you are thinking how to act.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{all is changed, sir. i must change too.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{yes. there is no doubt that we both must change. i was wrong ever to keep you here; this narrow stone vault with its one real fiend. i will shut it up. i will pay mrs poole two hundred a year to care for its inmate and then no one will be harmed when she is prompted to burn people, to stab them, to bite the flesh from their bones }
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{sir you speak of her with hate it is cruel. she cannot help being mad.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{it's not because she's mad that i hate her. if you were mad do you think that i'd hate you?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{then you know nothing about me, nothing about the way i love. your mind is my treasure and if it were broken it would be my treasure still. you are my sympathy, my better self, my angel. i will wrap my whole existence round you. let us leave here tomorrow. come with me as my wife.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{i will pledge you my fidelity }
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you can't.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{you'll live a happy, most innocent life }
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i must leave you, sir.}
<A>__{rochester cannot take this in.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{don't you love me?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i do love you but i mustn't show it or speak it ever again. i must begin a new existence strange scenes among strange faces. i must part from you.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{must be a part of me; that's what you mean. you are my wife, jane. in truth }
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you have a wife already.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{i was tricked, duped into wedlock with that demon hate, that harlot, that succubus upstairs. my father wanted her money and so i was sent to spanish town and the match was made. i hardly spoke with her. i was dazzled, ignorant, raw. my senses were besotted and i married her gross, grovelling mole eyed blockhead that i was.}
<A>__{rochester sits, staring at the fire.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{i lived with her for four years. she dragged me through all the degrading agonies which attend those bound to the intemperate and unchaste. her excesses developed germs of madness and the doctors shut her up. one night, unable to bear her screaming hate and knowing i could never be rid of her, i put a gun to my head to kill myself.}
<A>__{jane is both appalled and moved.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{i would have pulled the trigger, died in that tropical place but for a breeze which blew in from the sea and smelt of home. with it, i came to my senses. bertha antoinetta mason had abused my long suffering, sullied my name, outraged my honour and blighted my youth. it was enough. at that moment, as i decided to live, she ceased to be my wife.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{only my father and brother knew of the marriage and by then they were both dead. i let my connection with her be buried in oblivion and i brought her here. i have seen that she's cared for as her condition demands and that is all that god and humanity asks.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i earnestly pity you, sir.}
<A>__{he sees that jane is silently crying.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{jane, it's not pity that i see in your face. it's not pity }
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{do not say it }
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{it is love.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{stop }
<A>__{they are holding each other.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{i was wrong to deceive you. it was cowardly. i should have appealed to your spirit as i do now should have opened my life, described my hunger for a better existence shown you my chains. i give you my life. i give you my pledge. please, be my wife.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i can not.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{you would be my equal.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{i would make it so.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you once told me that hiring a mistress is the next worse thing to buying a slave.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{not my mistress }
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i would not degrade you by having you live with a slave.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{i said wife, my wife }
<A>__{jane tries to rise. rochester keeps hold of her hand. he gently pulls her down again. comforts her.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{do you really mean to leave me?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{jane...}
<A>__{he kisses her gently, lovingly.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{do you mean it now?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i do.}
<A>__{he runs his hands over her, with great tenderness. jane offers no resistance.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{and now?}
<A>__{jane nods.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{oh jane...}
<A>__{rochester lays her down.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{what friends would you offend by living with me? who would be injured? who would care?}
<A>__{jane is almost lost. she speaks in a small voice.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i would.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{jane, it would not be wicked to love me...}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{it would be to obey you. i care for myself.}
<A>__{jane's resolve grows. she resists.}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{the more alone, the more friendless, unsustained i am, the more i must respect myself }
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{will you listen to me?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i must listen to myself }
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{will you hear reason?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{let me go }
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{because if you won't i will try violence.}
<A>__{jane instantly stops resisting. she looks at him with utter shock. he is above her.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{i could bend you with my finger and thumb; a mere reed you feel in my hands.}
<A>__{jane neither moves nor speaks.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{but your eye; resolute, free. what ever i do with this cage i cannot get at you. and it is you, soul, that i want. why don't you come of your own free will here, to my heart? oh come, jane, come }
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(crying out)}
<D>__{god help me!}
<A>__{all the life seems to go out of rochester. he lets jane go. she pulls herself away from him. she stands. he remains, his face buried. she goes to the door. rochester turns his eyes to her.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{you have never called me by my name. my name is edward.}
<A>__{jane cannot speak it. she turns away.}
