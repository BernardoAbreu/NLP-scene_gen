<L>__{interior the salon late afternoon 1780's}
<A>__{constanze stands, closely veiled, holding a portfolio stuffed with manuscripts. the singing lesson ends, with two chords on the instrument. salieri enters the salon. constanze drops him a shy curtsey.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{excellency!}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{madame. how can i help you?}
<A>__{shyly, she unveils.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{frau mozart?}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{that's right, your excellency. i've come on behalf of my hus band. i'm i'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{how charming. but why did he not come himself?}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{he's terribly busy, sir.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{i understand.}
<A>__{he takes the portfolio and puts it on a table.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{i will look at them, of course, the moment i can. it will be an honour. please give him my warmest.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? while i wait.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{i'm afraid i'm not at leisure this very moment. just leave them with me. i assure you they will be quite safe.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{i i really cannot do that, your excellency. you see, he doesn't know i'm here.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{my husband is a proud man, sir. he would be furious if he knew i'd come.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{then he didn't send you?}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{no, sir. this is my own idea.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{sir, we really need this job. we're desperate. my husband spends far more than he can ever earn. i don't mean he's lazy he's not at all he works all day long. it's just! he's not practical. money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, your excellency. i know you help musicians. you're famous for it. give him just this one post. we'd be forever indebted!}
<A>__{a short pause.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{let me offer you some refreshment. do you know what these are?}
<A>__{he indicates a dish piled high with glazed chestnuts.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{cappezzoli di venere. nipples of venus. roman chestnuts in brandied sugar. won't you try one? they're quite surprising.}
<A>__{he offers her the dish. she takes one and puts it in her mouth. he watches carefully.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{oh! they're wonderful.}
<A>__{he takes one himself. we notice on his finger a heavy gold signet ring.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{thank you very much, your excellency.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{don't keep calling me that. it puts me at such a distance. i was not born a court composer, you know. i'm from a small town, just like your husband.}
<A>__{he smiles at her. she takes another chestnut.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? i have other things you might like.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{that's very tempting, but it's impossible, i'm afraid. wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. you see, they're all originals.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{originals?}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{a pause. he puts out his hand and takes up the portfolio from the table. he opens it. he looks at the music. he is puzzled.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{these are originals?}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{yes, sir. he doesn't make copies.}
