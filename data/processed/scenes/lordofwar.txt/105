<L>__{exterior highway. day.}
<A>__{yuri buys a fanta from a vendor exchanging it for a box of grenades. he sits on a soda crate for a front row seat at the chaos. yuri has a calculator out totalling his losses.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(muttering under his breath,}
<D>__{shutting off the calculator in}
<P>__{disgust)}
<D>__{what a fucking disaster.}
<A>__{yuri sees the pilot seats being stolen.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{hey, not those! you don't touch the plane!}
<P>__{(plaintive moan)}
<D>__{not the fucking seats...}
<A>__{glancing up the highway, yuri sees an approaching cloud of dust valentine and two truckfuls of heavily armed interpol agents. too late. the last of the guns and ammunition are being carted away on the back of a thin cow. valentine's truck fishtails to a halt beside the stripped plane. valentine is first off the trucks and into the plane's cargo bay empty. other interpol agents fan out futilely questioning locals. miraculously the weapons have vanished into the bush. valentine calls out to the last fleeing local a boy with a lifevest.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{hey, you!}
<A>__{the boy stares back, defiantly inflates the life preserver.}
<C>__{valentine }
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{forget it.}
<A>__{the entire cargo has gone. an errant bullet falls off a shelf in the plane and rolls down the floor valentine picks it up. yuri sits innocently on his soda crate. a frustrated african interpol agent, mbizi, wound up by the chase, rushes yuri slams him to the ground.}
<C>__{mbizi}
<D>__{you run from us.}
<P>__{(flashing a machete in yuri's face)}
<D>__{can you run with no legs?}
<A>__{valentine rushes over, pulls mbizi off yuri.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{no, mbizi. no, no, no.}
<A>__{valentine drags mbizi out of yuri's earshot. mbizi still wants a piece of yuri valentine preventing him getting to the gunrunner.}
<C>__{mbizi}
<D>__{let me disappear him, mr. valentine. he is a devil. let me disappear him.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{i can't do that.}
<C>__{mbizi}
<D>__{look where we are. who will know?}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{we will.}
<A>__{mbizi stops struggling against valentine.}
<C>__{mbizi}
<D>__{turn your back, mr. valentine. i will go to hell to stop him.}
<C>__{valentine}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(to his agents)}
<D>__{find the pilots.}
<A>__{mbizi and another agent reluctantly head off in a truck. valentine returns to yuri who is dusting himself off. valentine handcuffs yuri himself, picks up the soda crate and sits yuri back on it.}
<C>__{valentine }
<D>__{i've spent my whole career on the right side of the line. you're the first man i've encountered who makes me seriously consider crossing it.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{what's the charge?}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{what are you doing in sierra leone?}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{i'm on safari.}
<C>__{valentine}
<P>__{(referring to the bullet)}
<D>__{shooting wildebeests with submachine guns?}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{are you with the park service? hunting without a license is that the charge?}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{you're trafficking arms.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{trading. but without evidence who can say?}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{trade or traffic, you make a fortune by keeping the poorest people on the planet killing each other.}
<P>__{(hesitates, unsure whether to}
<D>__{waste his breath wastes it}
<P>__{anyway)}
<D>__{do you know why i do what i do?}
<A>__{yuri remains handcuffed, sitting on the soda crate dwarfed by the cargo plane. valentine paces beside him.}
<C>__{valentine }
<P>__{(ignoring him)}
<D>__{there are more prestigious assignments, you know. keeping track of the nuclear arsenals. you would think it more critical to world security. it's not. nine out of ten war victims today are killed by assault rifles and other small arms like yours. those missiles just sit in their silos. your ak 47 it's the real weapon of mass destruction.}
<A>__{yuri regards his interrogator curiously. despite the sun beating down, he feels obliged to give him his version of the facts of life.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{i don't want people dead, agent valentine. i admit, a shooting war is better for business. but i'd prefer people to fire my guns and miss. just as long as they're firing.}
<A>__{he regards valentine with something approaching pity.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{i realize the unspeakable things that are done with my weapons. i also understand the unspeakable things that are done with williams sonoma carving knives and wilson baseball bats and they aren't taking those off the market any time soon. people will always buy guns. why not mine?}
<A>__{valentine appears to have no answer.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{can i go? you've got nothing on me }
<P>__{(unable to resist)}
<D>__{ but cuffs.}
<A>__{now valentine smiles.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{i am legally permitted to hold you for twenty four hours without charging you.}
<A>__{yuri looks away, knows where this is going.}
<C>__{valentine }
<D>__{you may ask, why do i bother to do that? i can assure you, it is not because i enjoy your company. and you may be surprised to learn that it is not for any vindictive motive. no. the reason i delay you for every second of the permissible twenty four hours, is that i am delaying your deadly trade and the deaths of your victims. i don't think of it as taking a day from you but giving a day to them. some innocent man, woman or child somewhere has one more day on this earth because you are not free.}
<A>__{valentine looks to his watch.}
<C>__{valentine }
<D>__{see you in twenty three hours and fifty five minutes.}
<A>__{valentine walks away. yuri is left to ponder the notion. we see time lapse photography of yuri waiting out his twenty four hours, under armed guard on the highway stretching his legs, eating a suspicious looking sandwich, going to the bathroom, the sun arcing across the sky all the while his plane is being cannibalized by the locals. finally the time lapse slows back into real time. valentine returns in a jeep with mbizi and other agents.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{you'll be pleased to know your colleagues were no more co operative than you.}
<A>__{valentine opens the back of the jeep. lying in the back, the bodies of the two pilots shot and stripped.}
<C>__{valentine }
<D>__{the locals got to them before we could.}
<A>__{yuri turns away from the sight. his handcuffs are removed. returning yuri's documents, valentine notices a photo of ava and nicki in the wallet.}
<C>__{valentine }
<D>__{handsome family.}
<A>__{valentine and the agents get back in the truck and drive away.}
