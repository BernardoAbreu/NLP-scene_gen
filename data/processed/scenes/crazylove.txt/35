<D>__{i answered these questions last night.}

<C>__{michael}
<D>__{terrific.}
<A>__{letty smiles, a real smile this time.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{let me shift gears here a minute...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{what about patterns? do you find yourself checking and re checking locks? or washing your hands over and over again?}
<A>__{letty shakes her head "no."}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{how about arranging your possessions in a certain way?}
<A>__{letty pauses.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yes? go right ahead.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.}
<A>__{michael leans closer.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{how do you sort it by lace and cotton?}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{by color.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{what if it's got a pattern?}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{is this really important? because i don't think it's a problem.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i see.}
<P>__{(looking at his notes)}
<D>__{how long has it been since you've done something you've enjoyed, letty?}
<C>__{letty}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{a while, i guess.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{that must be really difficult.}
<A>__{letty tears up. michael puts his hand lightly on her arm.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{hey, it'll be ok. we'll make sure of that.}
<A>__{letty gives him an appreciative look.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{for now, why don't you just take it easy while i confer with my colleagues. a nurse should be in shortly.}
