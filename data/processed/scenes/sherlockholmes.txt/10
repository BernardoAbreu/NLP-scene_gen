<D>__{yeah, s'me.}

<A>__{thugs dispatched, holmes and watson look down and see a chilling sight. a woman in white lies inside a crudely painted pentacle (five sided figure), lit with candles at each corner. her eyes roll back in her head, trance like. a sword has been placed at her feet. a hooded figure kneels inside a double circle next to the pentacle. this is lord blackwood. we do not yet see his face. another hooded figure stands on the edge of the ceremony, shrouded in shadow. we do not see his face. suddenly, the woman rises up like a broken puppet, as if pulled to her feet by invisible hands. some kind of ritual is about to climax. holmes and watson head down, fast, not caring if they make a noise or not. their footsteps echo.}
