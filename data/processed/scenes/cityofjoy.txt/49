<L>__{interior max's room night (half hour later)}
<A>__{max smokes a monte cristo and watches poomina, like a frightened little animal, devour the last of a green acres room service meal and then wrap a small piece of fish in the paper napkin. she looks up at him, delivers a small burp. covers her mouth in charming embarrassment.}
<C>__{poomina}
<D>__{now, you are ready for great pleasure, yes?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{watching you eat was my great pleasure. now you go home.}
<A>__{as he escorts her toward the door, poomina is distressed. max realizes she can't leave empty handed. he pulls out some notes.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{for you.}
<A>__{she hasn't given up, though, and as he takes the money, she stands on tiptoe and kisses him. torn, max begins to respond. he stops himself, his grip on her causing her discomfort. his breath comes in little bursts.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you're a very wet kisser. work on it, get in touch in five years.}
<A>__{he leads her toward the door. like some lunatic comedy. she resists. he pushes. she locks her knees. he opens the door.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{goddamn it, cut it out! now, good night.}
<A>__{he muscles her out the door, closes it, wipes his lips. he stares at a parade of cockroaches gliding along the wall as he listens to her crying quietly on the other side of the door. he debates... and he loses. opens the door. poomina stands there; the tears stop and a lip twitching smile lights her face.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{five years already? gee, time really flies when you have no moral conviction.}
<A>__{she slides into his arms, pressing against him. with his shoulder, he closes the door, leaving us outside.}
