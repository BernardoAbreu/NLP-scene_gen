<A>__{indy flies down some stairs and starts to round a corner. suddenly he throws himself backwards, out of view. three uniformed nazis are clustered near a cabin door holding the messenger pirate. now two more come out of the cabin trying to maintain their grasp on a kicking, yelling marion. she is still wearing her white nightgown. more nazis clamber onto the deck and head toward indy, slamming open doors, rousting pirates, spouting racial epithets. indy steps backwards and fades into the maze of the ship.}
