<L>__{ext interior swamp shack day}
<A>__{edward pulls the door shut behind him as he leaves, but it breaks off in his hands. it's not the clean exit he was hoping for. inside jenny looks out, surprised and annoyed. edward tries to lift the door back on the hinges, but they snap off. the door frame buckles and the whole shack creaks.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{he tries to lean the door against the frame, but it keeps slipping.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{it's okay, just leave it.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i can get it. i can just...}
<A>__{he leans the door a different way. it holds for a beat then falls in, smashing a small table.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{lord, i'm sorry i...}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{please. go. just go.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i will...}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{go.}
<A>__{she's dead serious. weighing the scales of chivalry, he finally backs away. turns and heads back towards his car. we stay on jenny, watching him go. she's furious, but there's something more in her feelings for him. something softer.}
<C>__{jenny }
<D>__{most men in that situation would accept their failure and move on. but edward was not like most men.}
