<P>__{(looks to jack bangs)}
<D>__{behind the liquor cabinet.}
<A>__{jack bangs dully meets rudy's eyes. gabriel steps to the liquor cabinet, feels at the shelves. they split in the middle. and there is a combination safe mounted in the back. gabriel turns to jack bangs:}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{open it.}
<A>__{he pulls him off the desk. jack bangs wavers, struggling. he looks at gabriel. then at rudy.}
<C>__{jack bangs}
<D>__{i can't go back to vegas...}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{open it!!!}
<A>__{jack bangs steps to the safe. spins the lock. spins back. spins forward. click. jack bangs looks at rudy.}
<C>__{rudy}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{pow. wow.}
<A>__{and jack bangs opens it reaching inside in the same swift motion, so that as the safe swings open to reveal it's a rack of weapons that lies inside, jack bangs already has an uzi in hand }
<C>__{jack bangs}
<D>__{veeeeggggaaaassss!!!}
<A>__{bullets as he turns back to the room sending gabriel, ashley, and merlin diving for the floor! jumpy can't get down, as bullets riddle him dead and blow out the smoked windows overlooking the casino jack bangs keeps turning in a madman's circle blowing out the windows to the parking lot, shattering the liquor, sending rudy scrambling under his desk }
<C>__{jack bangs}
<D>__{i can't! go back! i can't! go back! i can't! go back!}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{go!!!}
<A>__{he and ashley both scramble for the windows, jumping out with two of the money sacks }
<B>__{to the casino floor}
<A>__{ and landing on poker tables below, overturning them jack bangs keeps firing, into the casino, shredding the tables but missing gabriel and ashley as he jumps right after them. back in bangs' office merlin scrambles to his feet, whirling with his gun, looking for rudy just as rudy slams into him. merlin's shot hits the ceiling. the two of them crash down, wrestling and rolling toward the parking lot window. two guns spill to the floor. rudy grabs one, just as merlin kicks out, leaping up and freezes, seeing rudy's got a pistol on him. before merlin can make a move, rudy fires and a thin stream of water shoots out. leaving a stain on his shirt. it's the water pistol. rudy stares blankly. as merlin swiftly snatches the second gun, a real gun, off the floor. rudy's dead to rights.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{hell. i'm gonna take pleasure in this...}
<A>__{with the gun on rudy, merlin finds a cigarette in his pockets. pops it between his lips, raises a lighter's flame and hesitates. sniffing the air. looking down. at the stain on his shirt. his lighter still lit }
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{me too.}
<A>__{ and rudy fires the water pistol again, this time catching merlin's lighter, which turns the stream into a arc of fire! he's filled alcohol in the gun! flaming liquor shoots into merlin's face and eyes. he drops the handgun. rudy keeps squeezing the squirt gun, spreading the fire down his neck and chest. merlin howls wildly and staggers back, blind and helpless, pinwheeling himself }
<B>__{out the parking lot window}
<A>__{ and crashing down on the hood of a pontiac, head through the windshield, boots on the bumper, dead. flames flickering.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{smoke 'em if you got 'em.}
<B>__{in the casino}
<A>__{gabriel and ashley have scrambled to the nova, tumbling in with the money sacks. jack bangs gets up, stalking toward them, still firing and babbling. gabriel fires back, hitting bangs in the chest. he staggers, but stays upright. his bullets riddle the car, shattering the windshield, but gabriel and ashley keep their heads down, slamming it into reverse and burning rubber backwards out the casino entrance, into the parking lot, and speeding out of sight. jack bangs stops shooting. he staggers back toward the bar, totters there, and turns, gun still raised. rudy stands at the base of the stairs to the security level. he puts his hands up, until he sees the dying look in bangs, face. the uzi drops to the ground. a silence. even the slots have stopped.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{jack bangs stares blankly. surveys the wreckage of his poor man's empire. and gives a small shrug.}
<C>__{jack bangs}
<D>__{that's why they call it gambling.}
<A>__{he slumps against the bar and hits the floor. dead.}
