<L>__{exterior mark's apartment building afternoon}
<A>__{jennifer pushes through the throng of people, which is now even larger than before. as she reaches the door mark opens it for her and slides her through.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{come up quick, they look like they could get out of hand any second.}
<A>__{mark hurries jennifer into the elevator.}
<L>__{interior mark's apartment living room afternoon}
<A>__{jennifer sits on the couch while mark, agitated beyond recognition, paces the room.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{just tell me what you told your grandmother.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i don't think i should. who knows what could happen next? i'm just going to keep my mouth shut from now on.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{what you said obviously affected a lot of people. i don't think you have the choice to keep it in now.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{sure i do. i could just walk out that door and get on a plane and go to namibia. no one knows me in namibia.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{just tell me what you said. please, mark.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{my grandmother was dying, and she was terrified, shaking all over. she didn't want to just become nothingness. so i told her that when she died there wouldn't be nothingness. that she would be with all of the people she loved who had died and that she would live an eternity of joy and happiness.}
<A>__{jennifer's heart skips a beat.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(barely able to speak)}
<D>__{how do you know these things?}
<A>__{mark sighs and looks out the window. the crowd extends down the block, all of them sitting calmly on his lawn, talking quietly to each other, trying to make sense of it all. jennifer gets up and stands beside mark.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{you have to tell them everything you know. this is too big. you have no choice.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{but you don't understand. the words i said... they weren't... it's not right.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{how did your grandmother feel when you told her these things?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{happy. at peace.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{and how did that make you feel?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(sweeping her hand over the crowd)}
<D>__{think how good it will feel to do the same for all of these people.}
<A>__{mark thinks this over.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{okay. but i need a few hours to get my thoughts together.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i will go tell them.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{wait! are you sure this is right?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{of course it is. you know something that's going to change mankind forever. it's the most important thing the world has ever heard.}
<A>__{jennifer leaves the room. mark, alone with his thoughts, sits down at his kitchen table, pulls out a few sheets of paper, grabs a pen and starts writing.}
