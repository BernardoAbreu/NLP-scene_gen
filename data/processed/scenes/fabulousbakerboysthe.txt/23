<L>__{exterior street}
<A>__{a taxi lets jack off on a street of shabby tract houses. in his rumpled city suit, jack looks like a cheap gangster amid the weedy lawns and overgrown junipers. he walks up to the door of a small white house and presses the doorbell. when there is no response, he goes around to the back.}
<L>__{exterior backyard}
<A>__{the backyard is small, with a short chainlink fence surrounding it. two kids, a girl and a boy, are splashing around in a build it yourself above ground pool. when they see jack, they stop splashing. only their heads are visible above the water.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hey, kids. dad home?}
<A>__{the two heads say nothing.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what d'ya say? wanna run and get him for me?}
<A>__{still nothing. jack frowns, takes out a cigarette, and pats his pocket for a match.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{the kids' eyes widen at his profanity. jack, the unlit cigarette dangling from his lip, ponders things for a moment, then flicks the'cigarette away and steps over the fence. at which point, the tinier of the two heads in the pool begins to scream.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hey, kid. take it easy.}
<A>__{no use. the kid's a world class screamer. frank, wearing baggy shorts and looking alarmed, comes racing out of the house.}

<A>__{cindy points. at jack.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}

<D>__{i will take her inside. you too, little frank. out of the pool.}
<A>__{donna shepherds the kids toward the house.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{feet!}
<A>__{the kids wipe their dripping feet on the outside mat and disappear into the house. frank turns to jack.}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it's probably the excitement of seeing you again.}
