<A>__{pov telescopic sight: focusing on roper, his lips moving... mccall, heaving for breath, has just dropped down into position, providing a view of roper and the inside of the glass fronted building.}

<D>__{right here, scott.}
<A>__{he touches the laser sighting attachment to his scope, a red beam activated... roper day from inside the building korda's voice:}
<C>__{korda }
<D>__{get your ass in here, roper.}
<A>__{just as roper starts to move he sees the red laser dot on the back of his hand mccall is up there, right behind him. roper moves inside. mccall day lying prone inside the operator's booth, steadies his rifle, looking through the scope. telescopic pov: he can see roper enter, his field of vision limited inside the building where the light penetrates, the room cast in hard shadows. he moves to the windows, all either painted white or so obscured with grime and dirt he can only see vague shapes and shadows inside. he moves back to the opening, roper now just inside.}
