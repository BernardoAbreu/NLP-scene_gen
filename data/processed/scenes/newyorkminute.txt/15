<L>__{interior first train car morning}
<A>__{drew finds a seat. she neatly folds her jacket and sets it next to her. she pulls out a lumbar support pillow and tucks it behind her just right. next, she takes out a tiny inflatable lap desk, blows it up and sets it across her lap. a pen goes in the little holder. coffee from her thermos. after laying out her interview materials, she turns to her reflection in the window.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(low; rehearsing)}
<D>__{professor spaulding. good afternoon. i'm drew macleod.}
<A>__{an executive takes the aisle seat next to her, and after a sideways glance at drew's portable office, opens his wall street journal as the train begins to pull away. every commuter is quietly reading the paper or staring off into their own world, wondering why their life has lead them to this sad moment when... ... they're all distracted by an awful, awful voice singing sheryl crow's "soak up the sun." it's parker, wearing her headphones and looking for a seat in the full train car. drew stares at her, dumbfounded.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{what do you think you're doing?}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(too loud; with headphones on)}
<D>__{looking for a seat.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{this can't be happening. wait, i know. this is one of those ground hog day dreams, isn't it?}
<A>__{drew pinches herself too hard.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{ow!}
<P>__{(to parker)}
<D>__{i'm awake now. you're supposed to disappear.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(still too loud)}
<D>__{you know, i just got this itch.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{then scratch it and get back to school.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i couldn't concentrate anyway. i'm too... distracted today.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{you're permanently distracted. it's called attention deficit disorder.}
<P>__{(spotting her blackberry)}
<D>__{is this about that chat room guy? it is, isn't it?}
<A>__{a look from the exec reminds parker of her headphones and she pulls them off.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{no! it's about spontaneity, which you obviously wouldn't know anything about.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i swear to god, parker, you go through boyfriends like junior mints. it's pathetic.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{pathetic? you want to talk about pathetic?! at least i don't count getting accidentally felt up in dodge ball as my first date!}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{you're going to be eighteen and you've never even had a boyfriend!}
<A>__{the executive furrows his brow at drew never?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{is this any of your business?}
<A>__{he goes back to his paper.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{this is ridiculous. i don't have time for this today. fine. don't graduate from high school. make a mess of your life over some complete stranger. i don't care. but leave me out. i have something important i need to accomplish today, so please go away.}
<C>__{executive}
<P>__{(to parker)}
<D>__{would you like this seat so you two can fight? drew parker no thank you.}
<A>__{drew's alarm watch beeps.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i have to mentally preview my day now. i can't talk anymore.}
<A>__{parker turns to go, then remembers something.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{uh, drew? do you have any money? i don't have enough for a ticket.}
<A>__{drew just rolls her eyes and turns her back on her sister. the executive peers over his spectacles at parker with the old paternal reprimand look.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{please. like you never ditched school.}
