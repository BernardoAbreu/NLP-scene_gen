<D>__{friend #1 you broke up with uberman! friend #3 you must have really, really high standards. i mean, you were dating a god. i mean, what's it take?}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{maybe someone who's a little more aware of his faults. someone a little more sensitive. friend #3 right. someone who listens, sexy but attainable with cute little cheeks like a hamster and heartbreak in his eyes.}
<A>__{she turns to friend one and two to explain.}
<D>__{friend #3 she wants john cusack. friend #2 the actor? friend #3 no, the famous pediatrist yes, the actor. ever since we were teenagers, roxanne's totally had the hots for him.}
