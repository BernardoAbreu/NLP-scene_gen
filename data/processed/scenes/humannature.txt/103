<A>__{nathan, lila, and nathan's parents (looking very, very old) sit at the dining room table. salad is about to be eaten, and everyone glances sideways over at lila, waiting for her to make her move. she reaches for the wrong fork, corrects herself and picks the salad fork. nathan breathes a sigh of relief. his mother looks disappointed, clucks. they eat in silence. finally:}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{it's lovely to finally meet you, mr. and mrs. bronfman. i've heard so much about you and i've seen you in photographs from nathan's childhood, but it's nice to meet you in the flesh. i must say, you look exactly the same as in the photographs.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{thank you, dear.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{actually, mother and father, you look very, very old. you look terrible.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{nathan!}
<A>__{his mother and father touch their faces reflexively, then look at each other and laugh.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{tell him, harold.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{son, your mother and i are doing a production of the gin game at the local community theater. we forgot to take off our make up.}
<A>__{the mother and father laugh again. then they pull at their latex faces. the wrinkles come off. and they look exactly as they did in the flashback scene, albeit a bit pink faced. there is another pause.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(awkward)}
<D>__{goodness, you two look exactly as you did in those old photos.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(cold)}
<D>__{yes, so you mentioned earlier, dear.}
<C>__{nathan}
<P>__{(changing the subject)}
<D>__{lila's a nature writer, mother.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{i love nature. as long as it stays in the zoo where it belongs.}
<A>__{the father and nathan laugh at mother's joke. lila joins in weakly, against her better judgment.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(to lila)}
<D>__{don't you agree, dear?}
<A>__{lila hesitates.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{of course she does, mother.}
