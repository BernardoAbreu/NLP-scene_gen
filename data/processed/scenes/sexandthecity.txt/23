<L>__{interior christie's auction house lobby day moments later}
<A>__{a lobby bustling with new york women. all types. carrie, samantha, charlotte and miranda make their way through them.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{it was a rare occasion that brought all types of women together. the socialites, the trendies the yuppies, the yentas.}
<A>__{the girls gently move past by an elderly yenta, who reacts.}
<C>__{yenta}
<D>__{why the pushing?}
<L>__{interior christie's auction house later}
<A>__{carrie and the girls enter a room filled with dramatically lit jewelry cases that display amazing jewelry. on the walls around the gallery are large photos of a beautiful raven haired woman (45). she is captured in candid poses "out and about" new york city at various social events wearing the jewelry on display.}
<D>__{carrie (v.o.) (cont'd) blair elkenn was a waitress turned model turned actress turned billionaire's girlfriend who came home one night to find herself unceremoniously turned out on the street.}
<A>__{samantha, carrie and charlotte page through the catalogues as they walk. miranda types on her blackberry.}
<D>__{carrie (v.o.) (cont'd) and now she was getting the ultimate break up revenge. an embarrassing and very public auction of all the jewelry he had given her when they were happy.}
<A>__{the girls stop. floating in a case at their eye level is a unique, "two finger" flower ring made out of diamonds.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{there it is. my baby. carrie big and she's a beauty.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{when i saw this in the catalogue i said to smith: this flower ring is the essence of me. one of a kind, filled with fire...}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{and a little too much.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{exactly. come on. let's go spend some of my hard earned hollywood money.}
<A>__{they make their way to the auction room.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{hey what's coming up on smith's series? is he going to sleep with that new blonde neurosurgeon?}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{he sleeps with every hot woman doctor in that hospital.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{great. can't wait.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{don't you ever get weirded out by seeing smith in bed with all those other women?}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{no, i think it's hot. sometimes, when i'm alone, i masturbate right along with them.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{and people say the golden age of television is over.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{besides, it's fake sex. when they're doing it no one's actually turned on.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{kinda like steve and i.}
<A>__{miranda laughs. everyone looks.}
<C>__{miranda }
<D>__{i'm kidding.}
<P>__{(beat; then)}
<D>__{but come one it's been seven years. he does that, i do this... it's not like a new plot twist is going to turn up.}
