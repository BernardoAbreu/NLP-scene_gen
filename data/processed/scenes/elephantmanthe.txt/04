<T>__{fade to black:}
<A>__{operating room the london hospital we see a bellows pumping air into the open grate of a cast iron stove. we hear moaning in the background. the coals flare to a fierce glow. from the mouth of the stove protrude the handles of several cauterizing irons, their heads imbedded in the coals. up above the irons, treves stands by a waist high operating table covered with black leather. his face is illuminated by an oil lantern held by a nurse. the room is fairly dark owing to the oppressive overcast sky seen through two windows. there is also a large sink, a cupboard containing dressings, gags, manacles, emetics and other unattractive things, and two hard chairs. two students and two other doctors, mr. fox and mr. hill, are present. the two students are pulling with constant pressure on a rope tied to the patient's leg. treves and mr. fox are working on a chest wound caused by a machine accident. there are gear wheel marks getting progressively deeper as they near a great open gash. mr. hill places a cotton mask over the patient's nose and mouth and applies drops of chloroform. the patient struggles, but soon his moans subside and he is unconscious.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{how long has this man been here?}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{three quarters of an hour.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{mmmm. hodges, pierce come closer. mr. hill, take hold of the rope please. it's a machine accident. i expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.}
<A>__{the two medical students come forward. they stare uneasily at the gaping wound, which bubbles each time the man takes an agonized breath. treves and fox quickly and expertly tend the wound as hodges and pierce look on.}
<C>__{treves}
<P>__{(off handedly)}
<D>__{abominable things these machines. one can't reason with them.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{what a mess.}
<A>__{treves now notices that the student's faces have gone a trifle ashen.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{what got you into medicine, hodges?}
<C>__{hodges}
<D>__{my father, sir. he's built quite a successful practice. i hope to take it over one day.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{is that your case as well, pierce?}
<C>__{pierce}
<D>__{yes sir. though of course i do have a great desire to help my fellowman.}
<A>__{treves smiles at them knowingly.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{of course you do realize that medicine has changed quite a bit since your father's time. in those days we didn't even wash our coats. in fact, the sign of a truly accomplished surgeon was his black operating coat, so stiff with dried blood and pus that it could stand up by itself in the corner. i've still got mine upstairs... you don't mind blood, do you? hodges & pierce}
<P>__{oh no, sir. (etc.)}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{good, that's one thing we've always plenty of.}
<B>__{hallway}
<A>__{a hospital messenger boy, dressed in a blue uniform and a can is making his way down the hall. he stops and looks into an operating room much like the one we have just seen. inside, the room is empty. the boy closes the door and continues on to another operating room. the doctors move with great urgency around the operating table. blood is draining down into a white porcelain bowl. a woman can be heard moaning. the boy looks carefully, but finally closes the door and continues on his way. treves' operating room there is a hissing sound and steam from the cauterizing of the wound comes up obscuring part of treves' face. the patient is being held down firmly by the other men. the door opens and treves looks up. the boy pops his head in.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{excuse me, mr. treves, sir.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{i found it.}
<C>__{treves}
<P>__{(studying the boy carefully)}
<D>__{did you see it?}
<A>__{the boy shakes his head slowly, "no."}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i will be with you in a moment ...}
<A>__{the boy closes the door.}
<C>__{fox}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i say freddie, what are you about?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.}
<A>__{aerial shot from third floor of the london hospital looking down on the hospital square. below, treves is walking briskly across the square, through a gate and into the slums beyond. the aerial shot is actually fox's pov, and now we see fox filled with curiosity, watching the figure from a window. looking down from above and to the side of him, we follow treves walking through a cobblestone street still wet from a recent rain, covered with horse manure and filth of all sorts. the air is smoky from meat burning fires. rounding a corner, we see and approach the painted canvas sign of "the elephant man" covering the front of a small, dingy shop. the door of the shop is windowless and padlocked. treves walks into the picture, studies the whole scene for a moment, goes to the shop door and finds that it is padlocked. treves tries to look under an edge of the canvas. to his left he sees a small boy watching him intently.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{do you know where the proprietor is?}
<A>__{he holds a coin out. the boy nods, snatches the coin and then disappears around the corner. treves turns back to the canvas.}
<B>__{a pub}
<A>__{a noisy pub, long and narrow. benches run the length of the back wall, with small tables up against them. men are clustered around the bar, talking in groups. we see the boy standing at one of the tables talking to the owner, greedily consuming his lunch as he listens. the boy gestures outside.}
<B>__{outside the pub}
<A>__{the boy comes out the door, quickly followed by the owner hurriedly putting on his coat, fumbling with a riding crop, the last of his sandwich stuffed in his mouth.}
<B>__{at the corner}
<A>__{the boy and the owner are carefully looking around the corner at treves still in front of the portrait.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{he's not a peeler...}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{no, i don't think so.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{no... i don't think so.}
<A>__{they walk into the street.}
<B>__{in front of the shop}
<A>__{the owner and the boy walk up to treves.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{are you the proprietor?}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{and who might you be, sir?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{just one of the curious. i'd like to see it.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{i don't think so. no sir, we're closed.}
<A>__{treves pulls a purse from his coat, extracts a coin and holds it out.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i'd pay handsomely for a private showing. are you the proprietor?}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{handsomely?... who sent you?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{pardon me?}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{never mind. i'm the owner.}
<A>__{he snatches the money.}
<B>__{inside the shop}
<A>__{total darkness. we hear the sound of the padlock being removed. the door opens and light streams in. the canvas covering the windows at the front of the shop obscures all other light. the owner enters, followed by treves and the boy. from his expression, as well as treves', we can tell there must be an awful stench in the room. no one says a word. the boy closes the door, while the owner lights a small gas light. we can now see the shop. it it empty, grey with dust, cold and dank. some old tins and a few shriveled potatoes occupy a shelf. the far end of the shop is blocked off by a curtain suspended from a cord by a few rings. the owner approaches it.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{here we are sir.}
<P>__{(ticking it off by rote)}
<D>__{life is full of surprises. ladies and gentlemen, consider the fate of this creature's poor mother. in the fourth month of her maternal condition, she was struck down by a wild elephant}
<P>__{(leering)}
<D>__{struck down, if you take my meaning, on an uncharted african isle. the result is plain to see ladies and gentlemen... the terrible elephant man!}
<A>__{the rings rattle back, and the curtain is omen. we see a bent figure crouching on a stool, covered by a brown blanket. in front of it on a tripod is a large brick, heated from below by a bunsen burner. from the blanket protrudes a perfectly normal left arm and hand warming itself over the brick. it does not move when the curtain is drawn. treves steps closer. the owner, watching his every move, turns and smiles at him. he bangs his riding crop on the wall and yells to the crouched figure, as if speaking to a dog.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{stand up!}
<A>__{the boy, excited by his own fear, mimics the owner.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{stand up!}
<A>__{the figure comes forward and lets the blanket fall to the ground and we see the elephant man himself. treves, his eyes wide with horror and wonder, his mouth frozen open, steps backward in an instinctive movement of self preservation. the owner laughs. the elephant man is naked to the waist, his feet are bare and he wears a pair of worn trousers from a fat man's dress suit. he is a little below average height, and looks shorter from the bowing of his back. his head is enormous and misshapen, as big around as a man's waist. from his brow projects a huge boney mass, almost obscuring his right eye. his nose is a nose of flesh, recognizable only from its position. from the upper jaw projects another mass of bone protruding from the mouth like a stump, turning the upper lip inside out, making a slobbering aperture. it almost gives the impression of a rudimentary trunk or tusk. on top of his head is a handful of lank, black hair. at the back of it hangs a bag of spongy skin, resembling cauliflower. these loathsome growths cover his back and hang down to the middle of his thighs. the right arm is enormous and shapeless, the hand like a knot of tuberous roots. his left arm is not only normal, but delicately shaped, with fine skin and a hand that any woman might envy. from his chest hangs another bag of flesh, like the dewlap of a lizard. his legs are also grossly deformed, his feet great stumps. behind him, as painted in the portrait, are two crudely constructed palm trees. the owner harshly raps again.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{turn around!}
<A>__{the elephant man begins to turn. the boy filled with malicious glee at seeing the monster obey, screams.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{turn around! turn around!}
<A>__{the elephant man completes his turn and comes to rest. we see a close up of the elephant man looking at treves. his face is utterly devoid, and incapable, of expression. we see the elephant man's eyes. he closes them.}
<B>__{outside the shop}
<A>__{the owner is locking up. treves, facing the street, drinks in the fresh air. he is trying to forget his shock, put everything into focus. he looks at the garish portrait again. treves produces his purse. the owner, smelling money, turns. treves hands him several coins.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{so you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? mr...?}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{bytes. mr. bytes. he'll be there.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i will send a cab. here is my card.}
<A>__{treves hands the owner a card. the owner, greasy and dirty, shakes treves' hand and squeezes his arm.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{now we got a deal... we understand each other... guv. we understand each other completely.}
<A>__{the owner gives treves the evil look of a conspirator. treves walks off, disoriented. the owner reads the card and smiles at treves walking away down the street.}
