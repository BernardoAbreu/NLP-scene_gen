<L>__{exterior farm day}
<A>__{more soldiers have continued to make their way to the shelter of the farm. everywhere is the chaos of war. wounded men lie awaiting the attentions of either the medicos or the priest. prisoners huddle in cowed groups. everyone looks for food. individual soldiers, like lost souls, run here and there trying to regroup with their comrades. the youngest are squires of twelve or thir teen, the oldest are red faced, overweight knights in expensive armor. hector and beatrice have found a quiet corner where they can sit and talk. behind them is a group of soldiers, reserves who have not yet joined the battle. they are much fresher than the rest and are drilling as a disci plined unit. their movements are a strange cross between parade ground drill and battle training. to the beat of drums they perform rhythmic, hypnotic movements, repeating the same pattern over and over again. a deadly dance, thrusting their pikes in unison. they become like one evil, inhuman machine. it is mesmerizing to watch, all the more so in relation to the coy seduction scene that hector and beatrice are acting out. they have the problem of not sharing a language, but, resourceful as lovers are, they soon employ this as another titillating element in their love play.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i think you know what i'm saying ... a little...}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{no, i don't, i don't understand a word.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{how come you don't speak like anyone else? are you far from home? home? where you sleep and live?}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{i think i know what you mean... home.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i'm far from home, too... way, way over there... then across the sea...}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{you're losing me again.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{have you ever seen the sea? water everywhere... right to the end of the world... i come from the other side of the little water, then there's the big, big water... i had a friend who sailed on that... went too far... fell right over the edge... into nothing. they never came back... they fell off the world...}
<A>__{hector smiles, pleased with himself. beatrice laughs.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you think that's funny? it's true... it's a sad story... you shouldn't laugh.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{talk about home again... remember you said home?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i'm not making sense, am i? well, let's go back to homes. that's where i'm going... i've been away for too long... some people locked me up... i had to run away.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{tell me something else.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{we have to learn to talk the same... try it like me, say it... home...}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{i know what you're saying... you're saying home... say something else.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{home... home... try it... home...}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{you want the word for home? it's home... say it... home... home...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i don't want your word for home, i want you to say mine... home... home...}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{come on, you can do it... home... home...}
<A>__{beatrice has her way, turning the tables on hector. he says it in her language.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{home... home...}
<A>__{beatrice smiles. in this tiny victory the dynamic of their relationship is set.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{that's it... clever boy!}
<A>__{they fall silent, suddenly shy. beatrice breaks this moment by reaching out to hector's neck, very delicately, like a caress. hector smiles. there first touch. then it changes. beatrice completes her movement with a sharp grab at hector's hair, and pinches her fingers on something. triumphantly she shows him the flea she has caught.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{tick... it's a tick.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{flea... a flea... thanks.}
<A>__{beatrice looks at him directly now, their intimacy well under way.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{bet there's more in there. you need a good going over... nobody's been looking after you.}
<A>__{she ruffles his hair, in a motherly but then again sex ually provocative way. he understands her well now.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{why don't we go somewhere and have a good session... i could do you... i'd like to give you a good grooming...}
<A>__{they understand each other perfectly now. they look around for a more private spot.}
