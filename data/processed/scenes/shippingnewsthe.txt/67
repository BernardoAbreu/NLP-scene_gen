<L>__{exterior omaloor bay day}
<A>__{the sky threatens black. quoyle picks his way across the rocks to his ungainly, much maligned boat, as it bobs against the weathered dock. he crouches, and as he begins to untie it, his gaze drifts out toward the nearby point, and... ...something catches his eye. a boulder in the shape of a great dog. and as he stares, there is something below it. something in a cove protected from intrusion by a jagged ring of menacing rocks... ...it is a man in a yellow suit. his head under the surface as if looking for fish. arms and legs spread out like a starfish, the body slides in and out of a small cave. tugged by the sea like a top on a string. quoyle stares in frozen shock.}

<A>__{no way in past the pounding surf, the savage rocks. so quoyle turns sharply. squints across the bay.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{what was my panic? he was already dead. maybe i thought, in some dim way...}
<A>__{climbs into his boat, turns the engine over. kicks it in overdrive toward the town across the bay.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{...if it wasn't too late for him. it wouldn't be for petal.}
<A>__{streaking out, toward the black sky. racing to open sea where the chop increases drastically. closer. closer...}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{once i was past the shelter of the lee shore, and into the real wind. i realized my mistake.}
<A>__{...clear of the point's protection, the wind rocks the tiny craft, swells coming broadside. the boat rises, then drops with cruel speed. quoyle tries to swing the boat around, the propeller races, the bow pitches violently, slamming down, the stern swamped, the hull filling, swerving broadside just as the oncoming sea hits with all its force, and the little boat... ...rolls over, quoyle suddenly flying under water, limbs flailing in all directions...}
