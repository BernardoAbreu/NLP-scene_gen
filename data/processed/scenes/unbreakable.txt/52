<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior store day}
<A>__{the same intelligent piercing eyes, twenty five years older. elijah has grown into a handsome, regal looking man. he leans on a walking stick. he's looking at an impressively framed charcoal sketch on a wall. two figures are depicted on the top of a building locked in fierce battle. one figure is extremely muscular with a mask. the other is half human, half animal.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{this is from fritz champion's own library. this is before the first issue of the comic book hit the stands in 1968.}
<A>__{elijah glances at the business man standing next to him and then back to the sketch.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{it's a classic depiction of good versus evil. notice the square jaw of slayer common in most comic book heroes. and the slightly disproportionate size of jaguaro's body to his head. this again is common, but only in villains... the thing to notice about this piece... the thing that makes it very, very special... is its realistic depiction of its figures. when the characters eventually made it into the magazine they were exaggerated... as always happens.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{this is vintage.}
<A>__{the business man rubs his face. gazes at the sketch. beat.}
<C>__{business man}
<D>__{wrap it up.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{you've made a considerably wise decision.}
<A>__{elijah starts to the back of the store which we now see is some type of art gallery where all the framed pictures are images and sketches from comic books.}
<C>__{business man}
<D>__{my kid's gonna go berserk.}
<A>__{elijah jams his walking stick into the extra thick carpet and stops. he turns.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{once again please?}
<C>__{business man}
<D>__{my son jeb. it's a gift for him.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{how old is jeb?}
<C>__{business man}
<D>__{four.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{elijah starts back to the businessman shaking his head strongly.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{no, no, no, no no... you need to go now.}
<C>__{business man}
<D>__{what did i say?}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{do you see any telletubbies around here?... do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... do you see a little asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... no?... well that's what you see at a toy store? any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named jeb. one of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time...}
<A>__{elijah's eyes pierce through the shaken man.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{this is an art gallery my friend. this is piece of art...}
<A>__{elijah points at the sketch.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{this is one of seventeen original drawings by fritz champion remaining in the world. it's value will triple every year... this piece is to be treasured. to be cherished... to be coveted by every single one of your banker friends that think they're better than you.}
<A>__{the business man stares at the sketch with large eyes. beat.}
<C>__{business man}
<D>__{what if i kept it?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{i'm listening.}
<C>__{business man}
<D>__{i will keep it in my office room.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{what about jeb?}
<C>__{business man}
<D>__{i have a lock on the door.}
<A>__{elijah just stares.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{will it be near a window?}
<C>__{businessman}
<D>__{no direct sunlight will fall on it.}
<A>__{elijah eyes the man for many seconds. beat.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{come back in three days. i will think about it.}
<A>__{elijah starts to the back. he passes the front door as two customers walk in. elijah talks over his shoulder to them.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{we're by appointment only.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{i received a card from your store.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{congratulations, you have a mailbox... the sale isn't for two weeks.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{this one was under the windshield of my car.}
<A>__{elijah turns and faces the customers for the first time. david dunne stands with jeremy. elijah just stands staring for the longest time. beat. he walks closer to them. when elijah speaks, his voice has a whispery quality to it.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{you've never been sick?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i don't know for sure.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{...i don't think so.}
<A>__{david and elijah quietly look at each other. beat.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{well if this ain't a riddle worthy of the riddler?}
