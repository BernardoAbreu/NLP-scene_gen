<D>__{i've had many children, kevin. so many disappointments. neurotic, indecisive wannabes. over eager, ham handed butchers. strung out, priapic losers. and then there's you. your mother, i will tell you, she outstripped my wildest fantasy. that church she dragged you to? every day? what training. what a challenge! it's awesome what you've done. how far you've come. both of you... you and your sister.}

<D>__{god's your prankster, my boy. think of it. he gives man instincts. he gives you this extraordinary gift and then, i swear to you for his own amusement his own private, cosmic gag reel he sets the rules in opposition. it's the goof of all time. look but don't touch. touch but don't taste. taste but don't swallow. and while you're jumping from one foot to the other he's laughing his sick fucking ass off! he's a tight ass. he's a sadist. he's an absentee landlord!}
