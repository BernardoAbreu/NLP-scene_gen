<L>__{interior bus night}
<A>__{alike becomes more quiet and less playful as the ride wears on. a middle class bronx landscape, well lit with a newly constructed starbucks and renovated condos flits by the window. alike reaches over and presses the tape. laura elbows alike.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{quit playing.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{your stop.}

<D>__{why you gon' walk all the way back down for? that's stupid.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{make sure you get home okay.}
<A>__{the bus pulls to the curb. the light flicks on over the back door.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{you ain't big, nigga. trying to protect somebody. hurry up, man, get off!}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(to bus driver)}
<D>__{that's alright man next stop. next stop!}
<A>__{alike elbows laura sharply. the bus driver frowns in the rear view.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you ain't gotta push me, why're you beastin'?}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{i'm not beastin'.}
<A>__{laura climbs over alike and swings toward the door.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you got a problem. call me.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{i'ma call you.}
<A>__{alike turns and watches laura stroll away. laura drums a little beat on alike's window as the bus pulls off. alike waves and faces forward again. an old lady sitting nearby shoots her a disapproving look. alike rolls her eyes and moves to a seat farther away.}
