<L>__{interior lounge}
<A>__{the lounge is deserted between shows, and all the lights are out. the mobsters enter with guns drawn.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{i can't see anything in here!}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{willy hit the lights.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{find 'em!}
<A>__{willy moves off to find the light switch. there is a flash of black and white fabric behind some chairs.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{there! before he can shoot, there is another flash of fabric on the opposite side of the room.}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(aiming)}
<D>__{no there!}
<A>__{and a third flash of fabric near the stage.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{over there!}
<A>__{willy has found the lights, and the lounge is suddenly brightly lit. the mobsters blink for a moment, then find all the nuns bunched together in a corner, trying to find an exit.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{freeze! everybody!}
<A>__{the nuns turn and face the mobsters, shielding christy.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{joey?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{where is she?}
<A>__{christy steps forward, to the front of the stage.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{right here. let the others go they have nothing to do with this.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{joey do it.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{but, boss she's still, you know, a nun.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{she's a broad! got it! just some broad!}
<A>__{mother superior steps forward.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<P>__{(with authority)}
<D>__{i guarantee you, she is no broad. she is sister mary clarence, of st. katherine's convent. she is a model of generosity, virtue and love. you have my word, gentlemen. she is a nun.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{hear that? now aren't you glad we didn't shoot her?}
<A>__{vince has had enough. facing christy, he raises the gun and points it right between christy's eyes, only inches away. the nuns all recoil with horror. blam! the gun goes off, but christy isn't hit. she blinks her eyes open, shocked to be alive. instead, it's vince who falls, crumpling to the floor, and clutching his shoulder. across the room, eddie holds a smoking police revolver. the nuns all swarm around christy joyously.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{mary clarence you're alive!}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{christy.}
<C>__{mary lazarus}
<P>__{(also smiling)}
<D>__{van cartier.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{you know? about me? about everything?}
<A>__{christy breaks away from the jubilant nuns. she faces mother superior.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{reverend mother thank you.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{oh?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{you saved my life.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{i'm a christian.}
<A>__{police pour into the room and gather up joey, willy and vince. eddie walks over to christy and mother superior.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{don't you have a concert to go to?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{that depends. sisters, you don't know this, but reverend mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. that's bad news. i don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{not a note.}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{impossible.}
<A>__{mary lazarus coughs, and points to her throat, as if she has laryngitis. all the other nuns imitate her.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(to mother superior)}
<D>__{then i guess you're stuck. life sentence. no parole.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{very well.}
<P>__{(she turns to eddie)}
<D>__{i hold you responsible for all of this, for introducing a lounge act into my convent. for utterly disrupting our way of life. and for placing all of us in mortal danger.}
<P>__{(sincerely, with a smile)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{angle on christy, watching this. she grins.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{yeah, eddie, thanks a whole bunch. thanks for sticking me in a convent. so you think, after all this, maybe i really am a nun?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i don't know. there's only one way to be absolutely sure.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{yeah, like what?}
<A>__{eddie takes christy in his arms, and they begin a kiss. as they do so, vince struggles toward christy, as two cops hold him back. he is furious.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{i was good to you! you re nothing but no talent garbage! you're a two bit tramp!}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(staring at vince,}
<D>__{seeing him for the scum}
<P>__{that he is)}
<D>__{that used to be true, vince. i was with you. but something happened. and i'm different now. real different. i've had, well, you might call it a religious experience. and i've got just two words for you. and those two words are...}
<C>__{mary robert}
<P>__{(afraid christy will curse)}
<D>__{mary clarence!}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(grinning, to vince)}
<D>__{bless you.}
