<A>__{we follow a suburban housewife as she pushes her shopping cart through the aisles of a bright and shiny super market. she picks up a six pack of coke and notices the label: "new coke it tastes great! and it's good for you!" the housewife smiles widely and enthusiastically tosses it in her cart. series of cuts: the housewife grabbing different products, marveling at the new, improved features: "cures sadness!", "tastes better than real chicken!", "this candy is all your body needs to survive!" with a full cart the housewife wheels it to the checkout counter to find swarms of people already there, all of their carts bursting to the brim with new, exciting products. everyone looks excited and happy.}
