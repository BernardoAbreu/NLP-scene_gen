<L>__{exterior the raft lifeboat late afternoon}
<A>__{a calm day; gentle waves. afternoon, the sun beating down. pi wears his shirt wrapped around his head to hold off the heat.}
<P>__{pi (v.o. cont'd)}
<D>__{hunger can change everything you ever thought you knew about yourself.}
<A>__{pi uses his knife to cut another scratch into the hull. there are 38 scratches on the side of the lifeboat. he glances down, staring longingly at the fish that swim just beneath the raft, then looks across the lifeboat, where the gaff lies hooked in the tarp close to the tiger's end of the boat. richard parker is nowhere to be seen. pi reaches out with the boat hook to try to snag the gaff, but it is hooked deeply into the tarp. he lays the boat hook on the tarp and climbs aboard, crawling forward to free the gaff. as he wiggles the hook free, richard parker's head pops out from beneath the tarp only a few feet away. pi's winces, prepared for an attack. in an instant, he's struck hard across the face a stunning blow that sends him backward onto the tarp. pause. pi opens one eye. richard parker hasn't moved. pi looks down a slender grey blue fish with wings is flopping about on the tarp. pi has been hit by a flying fish. richard parker has seen the flying fish as well. he rises to his haunches. pi grabs the flying fish and tosses it to richard parker.}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{here, it's yours.}
<A>__{the tiger stands, jaws opening in anticipation... and then the fish extends its wings, veering at the last second and dropping into the water. richard parker tries to bat the fish down, but it's too quick for him. the tiger turns back toward pi with a questioning glare. the air around the boat whirs to life as they are struck from all directions by a school of flying fish that descends upon them like a swarm of locusts. some sail clear over the boat; a number crash into the side. other, less fortunate fish land in the boat, where they start a racket of flapping and flailing. pi yelps in anguish as he is struck repeatedly. the school of fish is being pursued through the ocean by tuna. it is a feeding frenzy the ocean boils with jumping fish and snapping jaws. richard parker becomes totally absorbed in the kill, leaping, blocking, and batting down as many of the fish as he can. a fat, three foot long yellowfin tuna lands onboard, cracking hard against the center bench and falling, stunned and twitching, into the boat. pi sees richard parker's head swivel in his direction. in a moment of insanity brought on by hunger, pi reaches back and grabs the boat hook from the tarp, shoving it aggressively into the tiger's face just as richard parker launches forward. the boat hook catches richard parker square in the mouth; the tiger staggers back in shock and growls in outrage. pi rises up to his full height, staring directly into the tiger's eyes and shouting in fury, his gaze wide, his posture defiant.}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{mine!!!! mine!!! ahhh!! aaaahhhh!!!!}
<A>__{boy and tiger face off for several seconds, both panting, neither blinking nor showing fear, as the rain of fish gradually slows around them. richard parker turns his focus from pi and takes in the situation around him. realizing that he stands up to his knees in a pile of flying fish, he turns his attention to a more convenient meal. pi uses the gaff to snag the tuna, shoving it to the farthest edge of the bow. as he rises, late afternoon light casts golden flames across the surface of the water, throwing pi into backlight. pi picks up the boat hook and turns to face richard parker.}
