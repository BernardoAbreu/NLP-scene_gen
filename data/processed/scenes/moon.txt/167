<L>__{interior rec room day}
<A>__{sam 2 is sitting before the model. he's flipped it back over and returned it to the table top. now he is attempting to fix some of the demolished pieces. at this moment he's gluing the spire back on the church. sam 2 hears a sound from the corridor. moments later sam 1 appears in the doorway wearing the backpack. sam 1 is beginning to look alarmingly ill. his depleting health has been evident throughout the film, but now it seems to have jumped to a new level. he watches sam 2 for a little while.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{want me to help?}
<A>__{sam 2 shifts over to give sam 1 the adjacent chair. sam 1 walks over, sits down. together they work on gluing the church back together.}
<C>__{sam 1 }
<D>__{remember that crazy drunk guy who used to hang out by the church?}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{barbara streisand?}
<C>__{sam 1}
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{he looked like barbara streisand. we used to hide his bible when he passed out. drove the guy nuts.}
<A>__{sam 2 nods, remembering. a pause.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{how do you carve these things?}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{want me to show you?}
<A>__{sam 2 nods. sam 1 picks up a block of wood, grabs an exacto blade. demonstrates.}
<C>__{sam 1 }
<D>__{you need to hold the wood away from you. like this.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{you're shaking.}
<A>__{sam 2 isn't kidding. though he is carving the block of wood, sam 1 can't keep it steady.}
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{why are you shaking?}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{watch what i'm doing.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{you watching?}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{now you try.}
<A>__{sam 1 hands the wood and exacto blade to sam 2. sam 2 attempts to whittle. he smiles, a little embarrassed.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{i suck.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{you'll get the hang of it.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{you see, that's a little better already.}
<A>__{suddenly sam 1 turns around and has a vicious coughing fit. it actually seems to propel sam 1 out of his chair and up onto his feet. sam 2 watches with concern. eventually the coughing subsides.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{what's happening to you?}
<A>__{sam 1 averts his gaze.}
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{listen, i realize i've been less than cooperative. but i want to change that. you and me, we need to work together. and that starts with not keeping secrets from each other.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{now what's going on?}
<A>__{sam 1 tells the truth.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{i think i'm dying.}
<A>__{sam 2 stares back at him.}
<C>__{sam 1 }
<D>__{there's blood in everything. my urine. my vomit. i've got a constant headache. dizzy spells.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{the same thing happened to the other clones. i saw it when i hacked into the old man. after three years they all started to get sick. now it's happening to me. well, it's been happening for a while now. a couple of weeks.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{what do you think it is?}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{maybe we don't live that long. maybe we start to decompose or something.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{jesus.}
<A>__{suddenly sam 1 closes his eyes sways looks like he's going to pass out.}
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{hey hey hey, you okay?}
<A>__{sam 2 stands and moves to sam 1. holds him up, checks his temperature.}
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{why don't you lie down for a while? take some tranqs. get some sleep.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<P>__{(grim smile)}
<D>__{no tranqs. i don't think i would ever wake up again.}
<A>__{sam 1 manages a nod. sam 2 hooks his arm around sam 1's shoulder, helps him from the room.}
