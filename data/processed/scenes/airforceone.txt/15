<D>__{up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the mission communication center. the mcc, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth. we're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations. we could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.}
<C>__{korshunov}
<D>__{this is a remarkable aircraft.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{you don't know the half of it. did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation? we could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.}

<D>__{a dubious distinction, no?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{i guess it depends on your perspective.}
<A>__{they walk by several conference rooms, running down the starboard side of the plane.}
