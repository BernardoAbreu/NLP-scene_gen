<T>__{time cut:}
<B>__{doorway}
<A>__{ordell goes through frame, out the door, jackie steps into frame, and talks with him.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i will talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.}
<C>__{ordell }

<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you want your gun, don't you? come in. i will go get it.}
<A>__{she leaves frame, and max enters it, closing the door behind him. max stands by the door, a little surprised and a touch pissed at the nonchalantness. as he stands on the threshold to her living room, waiting for her to return with the gun, feeling foolish, he thinks about hauling her ass back to the stockade. that'll change her expression, he'd bet. she returns from the bedroom, gun in hand, wearing a sort of sad smile.}
<C>__{jackie }
<D>__{max, i'm sorry. i was afraid if i asked to borrow it you'd say no. you'd have to. would you like some coffee?}
<A>__{then, as quickly as the anger rose in max, it dissipates completely, leaving only curiosity.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{if you're having some.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i am. have a seat.}
<A>__{jackie head to the kitchen, making the coffee. max sits at the dining table off of the kitchen.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you get a chance to use it?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i felt a lot safer having it. my milk went bad when i was in jail.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{black's fine.}
<A>__{she puts a finger in the coffeemaker and starts scooping coffee in it.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{you want to hang on to it awhile? it wouldn't be legal, but if it makes }
<A>__{jackie goes to the sink, filling the coffee pot.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{thanks, but i have my own now.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you went out this morning and bought a gun?}
<A>__{she turns off the water.}

<D>__{somebody loan it to you?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{jackie leaves the kitchen. max's eyes follow her to the living room.}
<C>__{jackie }
<D>__{want to hear some music?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{jackie ends her knees and goes through a stack of records leaned up against the wall on the floor.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i couldn't wait till i got home last night and wash my hair.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{it looks nice.}
<A>__{she finds a record, takes it out of the pile, removes the album from the sleeve, and places it on her stereo turntable.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{you never got into the whole cd revolution?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i got a few. but i can't afford to start all over again. i got too much time and money invested in my records.}
<A>__{the song starts; it's an old romantic soul music number from the early seventies.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{yeah, but you can't get new stuff on records.}
<A>__{jackie picks up her cigarettes off the coffee table.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i don't buy new stuff that often.}
<A>__{jackie enters the kitchen door frame by max. she lights a cigarette and stands. max listens to the soul song.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{this is pretty.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{who is this?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{the delfonics.}

<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i don't know yet. 'm going to talk with dargus and nicolet today. do what you suggested. offer to help and see what happens.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{what i meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i want to talk to them first. i know more now about ordell's money.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{well, if the a.t.f. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a pointerior}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{it's a lot of money. about a half a million dollars. all of it in cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin in.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{how'd you find that out?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{he told me last night.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{he called you?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{he came by.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{what?... what'd you do?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{we talked.}
<A>__{jackie goes back in the kitchen. coffee's almost there, but not quite. she pulls down two mugs from a cabinet.}
<C>__{jackie }
<D>__{he had his doubts at first. but he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{he needs me. without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in cabo. sugar?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no thanks. there's gotta be other ways to get it out.}
<A>__{she pours the coffee.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{maybe, but 'm the only one he's ever used. he can't trust his other people. they're crooks. he can try bringing i in himself, but ordell sure don't want to go through no customs line. either he recruits another cabo stewardess, or he continues to trust me. i made him feel he still can.}
<A>__{jackie walks to the table with the two coffee mugs and sits down.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{how do you get it out?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{same way i been don', but first they got to let me go back to work.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you're gonna offer to set him up?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{if i get let off. otherwise, fuck 'em.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{it's very possible ordell's killed somebody.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i ain't goin' to jail, and i ain't doin' that probation thing again.}
<A>__{max watches her a moment jackie takes a drink of coffee.}
<C>__{jackie }
<D>__{how do you feel about getting old?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you're not old. you look great.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i'm asking how you feel. does it bother you?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{it's not really something i think about.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{okay, i'm a little sensitive about my hair. it started falling out ten years ago. so i did something about it.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{how'd you feel about it?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i'm fine with it, or i wouldn't of done it, i did it to feel better about myself, and i do. when i look in the mirror it looks like me.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{it's different with men.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you know, i can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.}
<A>__{jackie smiles.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{in fact, i'd make a bet that except possibly for an afro you look exactly the same as you did at twenty nine.}
<A>__{jackie smiles into her coffee.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{my ass ain't the same.}

<C>__{max}
<D>__{nothin wrong with that.}
<A>__{jackie's smile grows bigger.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{does something else worry you?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i just feel like i'm always starting over. you said how many bonds you wrote?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{fifteen thousand.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{well, i've flown seven million miles. and i've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. the best job i could get after my bust was cabo air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. i make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits , ain't worth a damn. and now with this arrest hanging over my head, i'm scared. if i lose my job i gotta start all over again, but i got nothin to start over with. i will be stuck with whatever i can get. and that scares me more than ordell.}
