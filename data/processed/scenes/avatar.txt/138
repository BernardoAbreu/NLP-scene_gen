<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior hallelujah mountains night}
<A>__{strange horizontal lightning branches through the floating mountains, twisted by the magnetic fields. the sky is black and heavy with clouds.}
<L>__{interior shack kitchen night}
<A>__{jake is gulping black coffee like a tequila shot, looking pretty strung out. grace is smoking furiously.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{jake, i can't allow this. you're just not strong enough.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{it's the last door i'm going through it. you can help me or get out of the way.}
<A>__{jake pushes past her toward the corridor }
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(grabbing him)}
<D>__{will you listen to me? sometimes the na'vi themselves die in these vision quests. the venom takes you to the edge of death.}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{and the psychoactive alkaloid in the worm we have no idea what that'll do in an avatar brain.}
<A>__{jake breaks free and wheels away, down the corridor. grace follows jake as he crosses to the link. a sheet of lightning flashes across the sky outside. norm is initializing the link.}
<C>__{norm}
<D>__{calibrating. thirty seconds.}
<A>__{she puts her hands on his shoulders.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{no matter what you prove out there you are still in here.}
<P>__{(shaking him)}
<D>__{right here.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i have to go all the way become one of them }
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(furiously)}
<D>__{goddammit, jake, you can never be one of them!}
<A>__{norm looks up, startled at the vehemence in grace' voice.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{our life out there takes millions of dollars of machinery to sustain. you visit and you leave.}
<A>__{during this, jake pulls himself from his wheelchair, levering himself into the link, hauling his useless legs inside.}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(softening)}
<D>__{you can never truly be with her.}
<A>__{jake stops, pinioned by the truth. he seems suddenly very lost.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you know why i'm here? because quaritch sent me.}
<C>__{norm}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{that's right to embed with the omaticaya. to find out how to screw them out of their home. by deceit or by force, he didn't care. and if it turned out to be force, then how best to do it.}
<A>__{norm is in shock. but grace is eerily calm.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{and what about now, jake?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i'm not that guy any more.}
<A>__{grace nods. she's been on his journey every step of the way.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{but if i tell quaritch the truth, he yanks me out i never see her again. and if i tell her the truth, the clan throws me out that's if they don't cut my heart out and show it to me.}
<A>__{jake looks hopelessly at the two of them. in his own perfect hell.}
<C>__{norm}
<D>__{they won't understand what you've done.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{they don't even have a word for "lie" they had to learn it from us.}
<A>__{grace sees he is on the verge of tears. lost and alone, between worlds.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i know. i taught it to them.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(pleading)}
<D>__{grace. i've gotta go. they're waiting.}
<C>__{norm}
<D>__{link is ready.}
<A>__{grace stops him as he tries to close the lid.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{jake. you can't carry this burden much longer.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(smiling wanly)}
<D>__{it's okay. mo'at says an alien mind probably can't survive the dream hunt anyway.}
<A>__{grace closes the lid. it feels like closing a coffin. she watches his psionic patterns aligning to his avatar, somewhere out in the night.}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(to norm)}
<D>__{prep my link. i'm going in.}
