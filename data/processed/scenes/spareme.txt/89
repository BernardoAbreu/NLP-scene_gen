<A>__{theo pulls into the parking lot. the place is cordoned off with day glo yellow emergency tape printed with "bowling police do not cross". a black bowling police van, its blue light spinning, is parked in front. bowling cops herd dwarfs and customers into the van. mothers and daughters mill around behind the yellow tape. a group of little people brandish "right to work" signs. theo gets out of his car. the crowd moves in as kastle, hands cuffed behind him, emerges from the door.}

<C>__{kastle}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{lock your daughters up, ladies! junior's out there! mothers and daughters send out a cacophony of screams and scatter for their cars. the bp cops hoist kastle into the back of the van. sid slams the doors shut. the van screeches off, sirens wailing. sid and breeze walk up to theo.}
