<A>__{the elevator descends. then a tone chimes, signaling the end of the ride. the doors hiss open }
<L>__{interior the vampire archives, hallway night}
<A>__{blade and karen enter the narrow, maze like "stacks" of the vampire archives, weaving their way through shelves of climate controlled, digitized records.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what is this place?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{some kind of archive }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{isn't this all a little high tech? i thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{you've been watching too much tv. they've got their claws sunk into everything finance, real estate, politics. probably own half of downtown.}
<A>__{blade pulls a cd rom from the shelves, its spine labeled in indecipherable vampire glyphs.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{this must be where they keep their records }
<A>__{he pauses, hearing a distant whisper. blade signals quiet, silently leading karen through the stacks towards pearl's lair a vestibule of sorts, leading to a larger bed chamber constructed of rice paper shoji screens and tatami mats. candles glow within, illuminating a monstrously obese shadow beyond the translucent rice paper walls. the shadow speaks in a tremulous, bird like voice the secret tongue. as blade draws his sword, the massive shadow freezes }
