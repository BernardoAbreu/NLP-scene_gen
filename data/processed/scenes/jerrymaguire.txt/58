<L>__{exterior corner office night}
<A>__{bam. jerry's door opens. he exits his office with box. he is now in a state of advancing melancholy, slightly unhinged. many of the other agents now try not to watch him leaving.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{well, don't worry! i'm not going to do what you think i'm going to do, which is flip out!}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<A>__{jerry goes to a water dispenser, calming himself, and fills a small dixie cup. downs it and fills it again, rubbing his face..}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{but let me just say, as i ease out of the office i helped build sorry, but it's a fact }
<A>__{on dorothy watching from her cubicle.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{ that there is such a thing as manners. a way of treating people...}
<A>__{he notices the fish tank nearby. he attemps to be profound.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{these fish have manners! they have manners.}
<A>__{and now jerry feels bravado, mixed with a wave of anger. another cup of water as he finds power.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{in fact. they're coming with me! i'm starting a new company, and the fish will come with me and... you can call me sentimental.}
<A>__{he begins dipping into the tank, grabbing the one exotic fish that failed to escape his cup. it's a fire tailed peruvian beauty. he grabs a baggie from an assistant's desk, shakes out some crumbs, and dumps the fish inside.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing; to fish)}
<D>__{it's okay... it's okay...}
<A>__{nearby, a xerox repair guy watches the human train wreck.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{but if anybody else wants to come with me, this moment will be the ground floor of something real and fun and inspiring and true in this godforsaken business and we will do it together! who's coming with me besides... "flipper" here?}
<A>__{but clearly even flipper is not happy with the new arrangement. panicked, he whips around the small baggie.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{anybody going with me?}
<A>__{silence, someone coughs, as agents and office personnel look on with equal parts pity and embarrassment. jerry downs another small cup of water. his lid is blowing off with each second.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{wendy? shall we?}
<A>__{assistant wendy looks at maguire. painfully polite:}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{i'm three months away from the pay increase, jerry. i have to, uh... you know, stay.}
<A>__{jerry absorbs the blow, and takes the keys from the top of her desk. she can't look at him. jerry stands alone, the blue mission statement on wendy's desk sits accusingly in frame. there is only silence now, the loudest kind.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{okay, anybody else?}
<B>__{on dorothy}
<A>__{she looks around. doesn't anybody believe in the very thing they were applauding three days ago? she has an odd reaction, a muscle twitch of the soul. before she knows it, she stands boldly, unfortunately knocking a cup of coffee onto herself in the process.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{i will go with you.}
<P>__{(quietly, on her coffee mess)}
<D>__{wonderful...}
<A>__{she dabs at her pants. next to her, cleo looks on sadly.}
<B>__{on jerry}
<A>__{halfway across the office.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{dorothy boyd! thank you!}
<A>__{she gathers her things, increasingly aware of what she's done.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{we will see you all again. sleep tight!}
<A>__{he walks to dorothy, and together they exit down the hallway corridor, past the framed posters and awards. wide shot rising over the huge office. for the first time, we see the full expanse of the huge smi headquarters. and down in the corner of the frame, two small figures leave carrying boxes.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(to dorothy)}
<D>__{let's see how they do without us.}
<A>__{a beat of silence, then noise returns to its normal commercial roar. a couple of fleas have been swatted off the carcass of an immense beast.}
