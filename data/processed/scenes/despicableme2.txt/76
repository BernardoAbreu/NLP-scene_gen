<D>__{sure, just a sec.}
<A>__{the hostess leaves. lucy looks around and then spots gru. sees him with the wig and shannon who is now doing crunches on the floor. lucy narrows her eyes, then has an idea. she presses a button on her watch, which transforms into a high tech eavesdropping device, and puts it in her ear. now she's able to hear gru and shannon talking. she watches them, intrigued. shannon has returned to her seat.}
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{your accent is so exotic.}

<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i don't think so, miss lady.}
<A>__{lucy presses a button on her watch and a target sight pops out. gru watches in horror as shannon reaches across the table for the wig. quickly lucy presses another button on her watch which fires a mini dart gun at shannon. plip. the mini dart goes into shannon's butt, knocking her out instantly. and saving gru from certain humiliation. gru stares at the now sleeping shannon, confused.}
