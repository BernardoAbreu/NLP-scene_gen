<A>__{harvey and joyce sit in the office holding hands, like two terrified high school kids. a doctor stands before them. they just got bad news...}

<D>__{i don't understand, does "tumor" mean the same thing as "cancer"?}
<A>__{the doctor gently nods. joyce covers her mouth. harvey holds onto his head. he looks positively dizzy. the doctor starts to talk, yet the words don't seem to match his mouth. he looks dubbed. strange phrases just weave together, echo and bounce off the wall, making no sense at all. ...we know the growth is malignant. what we don't know is how far it may have spread. once we have the results of the biopsy, we can make more informed decisions about treatment... blah, blah, blah... the whole office seems to spin.}
