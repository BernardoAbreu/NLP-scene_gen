<L>__{interior chiropractic office evening}
<A>__{louis helps jacob over to an adjusting table in a room that, compared with the hospital, is comfortable and serene. he pushes a lever and the table rises to a vertical position. jacob leans against it and rides it down to a horizontal position. every moment is agony for him.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. mark my words.}
<P>__{(jacob barely hears them)}
<D>__{well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(nearly whispering)}
<D>__{am i dead, louis?}
<P>__{(louis leans over to hear)}
<D>__{am i dead?}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{from a slipped disc? that'd be a first.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i was in hell. i've been there. it's horrible. i don't want to die, louis.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{well, i will see what i can do about it.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i've seen it. it's all pain.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(working on jacob's}
<D>__{spine like a master}
<P>__{mechanic)}
<D>__{you ever read meister eckart?}
<P>__{(jacob shakes his head "no")}
<D>__{how did you ever get your doctorate without reading eckart?}
<P>__{(louis takes hold of}
<D>__{jacob's legs and yanks}
<P>__{them swiftly)}
<D>__{good. okay, let's turn over gently. right side.}
<A>__{jacob turns to his left. louis shakes his head in dismay.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{the other "right," okay?}
<P>__{(he helps jacob turn over)}
<D>__{you're a regular basket case, you know that?}
<P>__{(he moves jacob's arm over his head)}
<D>__{eckart saw hell, too.}
<A>__{louis positions jacob's other arm, bends his legs, and then pushes down on his thigh. his spine moves with a cracking sound. jacob groans.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you know what he said? the only thing that burns in hell is the part of you that won't let go of your life; your memories, your attachments. they burn 'em all away. but they're not punish ing you, he said. they're freeing your soul. okay, other side.}
<A>__{he helps jacob and repositions him. again he pushes and the spine cracks.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{wonderful. so the way he sees it, if you're frightened of dying and hold ing on, you'll see devils tearing your life away. but if you've made your peace then the devils are really angels freeing you from the earth. it's just a matter of how you look at it, that's all. so don't worry, okay? relax. wiggle your toes.}
<A>__{jacob's toes dance as louis gives him a quick, unexpected jab to the lower vertebrae in his back.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{perfect. we got it.}
<P>__{(louis pushes a lever}
<D>__{and the table rises back}
<P>__{up)}
<D>__{okay. let's just give it a little try. see if you can stand.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what? by myself?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you can do it. come on. easy. just give it a try.}
<A>__{jacob steps cautiously away from the table. he moves hesitantly, with deliberate restrainterior louis encourages him like a faith healer coaxing the lame. his first steps have an aura of the miraculous about them. jacob walks slowly, without help. louis smiles impishly. he looks like a giant cherub.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{hallelujah.}
<A>__{louis puts his arm around him. then jacob tries again, gradually rediscovering his balance and strength. with each step his confidence returns. louis is pleased. then, suddenly, without warning, jacob turns and heads toward the door.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{there's something i've gotta take care of, louis.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what are you talking about? you can barely stand.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i'm walking, aren't i?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{jake, you need to rest.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{not tonight, louis. no more rest.}
<A>__{he walks slowly out the door. louis starts to go after him. jacob turns around and shakes his head "no." the look on his face is firm and defiant. louis stands back and lets him go.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i love you, louis.}
