<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{inside reilly's office reilly paces anxiously by the incubator eight hours later. lindenmeyer sits off to the side, looking no less anxious. it's close to 4:00 am.}
<B>__{through the circular window}
<A>__{there is no liquid left in the incubator it's all been absorbed. all that is visible is the silhouette of a human form crouched within steam. the form stands. inside reilly's office the human form inside incubator opens the hatch. steam pours out from within its confines as it climbs out slowly. the figure stands within the mist, admiring itself. then its surroundings. reilly approaches the figure with the expectancy of a father about to see his newborn child for the first time. lindenmeyer hangs back.}
<C>__{reilly}
<P>__{(expecting sheila 3.2)}
<D>__{baby, what i'm gonna do to you...}
<A>__{his face drops when sid 6.7 steps out of the mist. completely naked. lindenmeyer smiles proudly. fearfully. wickedly.}
<C>__{reilly }
<P>__{(to lindenmeyer)}
<D>__{who the hell is this?!}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<D>__{my name is sid. sid 6.7.}
<A>__{he extends his hand as if to shake. then grabs reilly by the throat and chokes him. hard.}
<C>__{lindenmeyer}
<D>__{sid no!!!}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<D>__{what do you expect me to do, thank him?}
<C>__{reilly}
<P>__{(gasping for air)}
<D>__{this... isn't.. .possible!}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<D>__{sure it is and it's all thanks to the many long hours put in by you and daryl.}
<A>__{he watches reilly's face with curiosity as the life drains from it. a puddle forms beneath him. he drops reilly's body to the floor.}
<C>__{sid 6.7 }
<P>__{(to lindenmeyer) )}
<D>__{real instruments are so much more responsive than virtual ones, don't you think?}
<A>__{lindenmeyer is nowhere to be seen. the office door is unlocked, and open. watching sid 6.7's expression, you realize something isn't quite right. his expression is exaggerated. artificial. only for a moment, but it's enough to remind you sid 6.7 is not human. the billions of nanomechanisms which make up his anatomy are still learning to function in a fully coordinated fashion. sid 6.7 is, literally, getting used to his new skin. in various ways throughout his "life" be it a wandering eye, or a momentary limp you will be reminded that sid 6.7 is a synthetic nanoorganism unlike anyone has ever seen. a surgical knife by the aquarium catches sid 6.7's attention. picking up the knife, he runs his finger across the razor sharp knife blade. cutting himself slightly. a drop of blood appears. sid 6.7 tastes his (synthetic) blood.}
<C>__{sid 6.7 }
<D>__{tastes different, somehow.}
<A>__{he then watches with interest as his wound regenerates, healing itself. the scar tissue is slightly off color.}
<C>__{sid 6.7 }
<D>__{i think i'm going to like it here.}
<A>__{glancing at reilly's prone body, he then slams the office door in our face.}
