<DIAL>__{"The economic explosion following the Civil War created an unprecedented nation-wide market for beef.  Previously worthless cattle running wild throughout Texas were gathered into herds And driven north to the railheads In Kansas.  Fortunes were made as Cowtowns sprang up on the Prairies, wide-open centers of Commerce and vice, their streets Choked with heavily-armed young Men fresh from the cattle drives. In those days the correct term For a cowhand was 'drover'. 'Cowboy', like 'cowpoke', was originally an insult implying deviant sexuality and was rarely used.  But these invading drovers were a wild breed for soon shootings and wholesale drunken riots became so frequent that ordinary citizens literally could not walk down the street.  In fact at their height the cowtowns had higher murder rates than modern New York or Los Angeles and there Was no law but that of the gun."}
<ACTION>__{A dashing FIGURE in a Prince Albert coat appears, long locks tumbling down his shoulders, twin Navy Colts thrust into a red sash at his waist, a tin star on his chest.  Next we see him in action, downing 3 barroom opponents at once, pistols FLASHING around the room like a strobe light:}

Doc FIRES one barrel into the air, the BLAST making the horse rear up, exposing Tom for a split second.  Doc FIRES again.  Tom's side EXPLODES into red mist, the full charge of red mist, the full charge of buckshot SLAMMING him into the Harwood house.  Tom drops his gun and teeters into the street, talking eerie little mincing steps, already dead but still moving, like a chicken with its head cut off.

As the last shot echoes through the hills, Frank flops limply to the ground like a rag doll while out in the street his brother Tom finally runs out of steam and pitches face first in the dirt, leaving only Billy, leaning against the Harwood house, legs splayed out in front of him, absolutely shot to pieces, clicking his empty gun and wailing piteously as the smoke clears:}

<ACTION>__{Brilliant sunlight, clean, crisp air as a train hurtles through a pass high up in the Rocky Mountains, blowing its whistle and sending a giant plume of steam billowing up over the sheer, towering, snow-topped mountain walls into the crystal-clear sky above.  Wyatt leads Josephine by the hand through the parlor car, both hardly able to contain themselves, brimming over with excitement and anticipation, like children waiting for Christmas morning and trying to ignore the group of REPORTERS dogging their footsteps, swarming around them, calling out to Wyatt:}
