<L>__{exterior equestrian riding grounds day}
<A>__{a steeple chase course lies shrouded in an arlington fog. across the damp grass a lone horse, heaving clouds of warm breath, leaps gracefully over a hurdle. driving the steed hard through the course, taupin pulls firm on the reins, bringing horse and rider to a shuddering stop where detective moran waits.}

<A>__{taupin climbs down from his horse. moran moves close.}
<C>__{moran}
