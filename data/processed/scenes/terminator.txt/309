<L>__{interior vukovich's office night}
<A>__{sarah, huddles in a blanket, is siting on a bench opposite vukovich's desk. motionless. her eyes are fixed on the middle distance. she's been crying. now she's emptied out. the door opens. at the sound of the latch sarah jerks as if struck, and cringes involuntarily. vukovich enters with traxler and dr. peter silberman, a criminal psychologist. silberman is smooth of skin and manner, young, ambitious and...fat. he is enthusiastic about the workings of the human psyche, as emotionally involved as someone pulling the wings off a fly. vukovich sits beside sarah and hands her a cup of coffee. he puts a paternal arm around her shoulders.}
