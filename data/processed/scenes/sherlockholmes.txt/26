<L>__{interior 221 baker st. holmes' apartments}
<A>__{watson squeezes through the doorway to find that the obstruction is holmes who is sitting in the dark on a chair, blocking the door, aiming a gun (with an odd contraption fastened on its barrel) at the wall. unadulterated chaos. a series of flaming bullet holes blasted into the wall in the (ragged) initials "v.r."}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{may i join you in the armory?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{please... watson, i've been working on a device which will suppress the sound of a gunshot.}
<A>__{watson heads towards the conservatory.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{please... don't, don't, don't...}
<A>__{watson pulls open the curtains allowing the light to pour in.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{it needs work. may i see?...}
<A>__{watson passes him heading to the other side of the room (possibly grabs the gun) picking up a pile of open letters from a table.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{gently, gently, watson...}
<A>__{watson whips open more curtains and opens a window. holmes crawls on his hands and knees over to a table where he finds his sunglasses and puts them on. watson sits on a chair and begins to leaf though the letters.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{it's been three months since the last case. about time you found another one.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i can't but agree. my mind rebels at stagnation. give me problems, give me work. the sooner the better.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{paper?}
<A>__{watson hands holmes the newspaper.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{let's see, we have a letter here from mrs. ramsey in queen's park her husband has gone missing.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{he's in belgium with the scullery maid. is it december?}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{yes, holmes. lady radford reports a missing emerald bracelet.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{insurance swindle. lord radford likes fast women and slow ponies. i see you're the attending physician at blackwood's hanging.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{yes, it's our last case together and i wanted to see it through to the end.}
<A>__{awkward pause. cough.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{mr. lewis is seeking...}
<A>__{mrs. hudson enters carrying a tray of bread and tea. she is steeling herself for this interaction.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(to watson)}
<D>__{there is only one case that intrigues me at present... the curious case of mrs. hudson, the absentee landlady.}
<C>__{holmes }
<D>__{i have been studying her comings and goings and they appear most sinister.}
<C>__{mrs. hudson}
<D>__{tea, mr. holmes.}
<A>__{mrs. hudson crosses to holmes and puts the tray before him.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{is it poisoned, nanny?}
<C>__{mrs. hudson}
<D>__{there's enough of that in you already.}
<A>__{she goes to remove an old tray from behind him.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{don't touch that. everything is in its proper place, as per usual.}
<A>__{she ignores him and removes the tray then crosses back towards the door noticing a bulldog lying unconscious under the table.}
<C>__{mrs. hudson}
<D>__{he's killed the dog... again.}
<A>__{watson jumps up. his bulldog, gladstone, lies on the floor in a drugged stupor.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{what have you done to gladstone this time?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i was simply testing a new anesthetic. he doesn't mind.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{holmes! as your doctor...}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{he'll be right as a trivet in no time.}
<A>__{watson's finally had enough.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{... and your friend, you've been in this room for two weeks. i insist you get out of here.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{there's nothing of interest to me out there, on earth, at all.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{so, you have nothing to do?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{then you're free this evening.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{for dinner.}

<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you're meeting her, holmes.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{have you proposed yet?}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{i'm still looking for the right ring.}
<A>__{a little smile from holmes.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{then it's not official.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{it's happening, like it or not. half past eight. the royale.}
<A>__{the dog wakes up and runs out.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{and wear a jacket.}
<A>__{watson exits, leaving holmes alone in his own chaos. for the first time, we see a hint of fear in his eyes.}
