<L>__{exterior field day}
<A>__{on the field, there are six people waiting with dascher, and his seconds. dascher takes 20 louis from his pocket and hands them to roderick, saying:}
<C>__{dascher}
<D>__{i may have been mistaken, but i mean to make you pay deadly for your brutality.}
<A>__{roderick takes the money and puts it in his purse with the utmost calm, making no reply to the other's boasting.}
<C>__{roderick}
<P>__{(privately)}
<D>__{it is distasteful to kill a scoundrel that should be work for a hangman.}
<C>__{chevalier}
<D>__{to risk one's life against such people is an imposition.}
<C>__{roderick}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i risk nothing, for i am certain to kill him.}
<C>__{chevalier}
<D>__{certain?}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{perfectly certain, because i shall make him tremble.}
<A>__{he takes his station between two trees, about four paces apart, and draws a pair of dueling pistols.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{you have only to pace yourself at ten paces difference, and fire first. the space between these two trees is the place where i choose to walk back and forth. you may walk too, if you wish, when it is my turn to fire.}
<A>__{no one could have explained his intentions more clearly or spoken more calmly.}
<C>__{dascher}
<D>__{but we must decide who is to have the first shot.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{there is no need of that. i never fire first; and, in any case, you have that right.}
<A>__{dascher places himself at the specified distance. roderick walks slowly back and forth between the two trees without looking at him. dascher takes aim and fires, missing.}
<C>__{roderick}
<P>__{(with the greatest composure)}
<D>__{you missed me, sir. i was sure you would. try again.}
<A>__{the others think he is mad, and had expected some kind of discussion between the parties, but not a bit of it. dascher takes careful aim and fires a second shot, again missing roderick. without a word, but in a firm and confident manner, roderick fires his first shot into the air. dascher looks amazed. then, aiming at dascher with his second pistol, he hits him in the center of the forehead and stretches him out dead on the ground.}
