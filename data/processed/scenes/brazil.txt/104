<L>__{interior basement day}
<A>__{the lift comes to rest. sam is still trying to get it to respond and return him to the lobby. two technicians are waiting as the doors open. from sam's pov he sees them hang a sign on the door and walk away. he bangs the buttons for another moment with no result. he looks out of the lift and is able to read the sign "lift out of order". frantically he looks around for another lift. all the others are on distant floors then he spots one off to one side, its doors standing open. rushing over to it he leaps inside and reaches to push the floor number but there are no numbers on the buttons, only letters. before he can sort this out a voice shouts at him.}
