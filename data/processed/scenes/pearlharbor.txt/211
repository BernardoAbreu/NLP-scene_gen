<A>__{rafe and danny enter. it's a scene from hell. doctors are doing amputations in the hallway. the once pristine hospital is now all red, with blood dripping through the mattresses, onto the floor... in the main ward, evelyn and the other nurses are using the fly sprayers to spritz cooling antiseptic on the charred bodies. evelyn looks up and sees both rafe and danny. her eyes register relief, but they are the only part of her that can show emotion now; the rest of her is covered in blood. rafe and danny move to her.}
