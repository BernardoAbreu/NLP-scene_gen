<L>__{interior farmhouse living room day}
<A>__{in the living room, kay sips some of her lemonade and winces. jay moves through the room, checking it out as beatrice tells her story.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{and they said to me, "if he was murdered, how could he walk back in the house?" and i must admit, i was a little stumped by that one. but i know edgar. and that wasn't him. it was more like something else that was wearing him. like a suit. an edgar suit.}
<A>__{a little giggle escapes her at the thought. jay, over by a bookcase, notices a framed photo of edgar, kneeling in the woods, proudly about to skin a deer.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{damn. if he was this ugly before he was an alien...}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{sorry?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{anyway, when i came to, he was gone.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{did he say anything?}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{yes! he asked for water. sugar water, if i remember.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{sugar water.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{did you taste her lemonade?}
<A>__{kay nods, puts on his sunglasses. takes out another pair, hands them to jay. kay draws his neuralyzer. flash! beatrice freezes, staring straight ahead as if hypnotized. kay takes jay's glasses off and hands them back to him.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{ray bans.}
<P>__{(pulling off jay's sunglasses)}
<D>__{okay, beatrice. there was no alien, and the flash of light you saw in the sky wasn't a ufo. swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted the light from venus }
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{whoa! that thing erases her memory, and you give her a new one?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{standard issue neuralyzer.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{and that's the best you can come up with?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{on a more personal note, beatrice, edgar ran off with on old girlfriend. go stay at your mother's for a few days and get over it. decide you're better off.}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(butting in)}
<D>__{yeah, and you're better off 'cause he never appreciated you anyway. in fact, you kicked him out, and now that he's gone, you ought to buy some new clothes, maybe hire a decorator or something...}
