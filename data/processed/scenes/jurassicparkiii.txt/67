<A>__{climbing higher in a tree, grant is just feet above a growing pack of raptors. he scales one branch, the next, finally reaching a perch that the dinosaurs can't jump to.}
<B>__{looking down}
<A>__{the entire pack is now standing still, watching him. in the center, the alpha male lets out a sort of bark. responding to the cry, the other raptors call back. as terrified as he is, he can't help but be fascinated by their communication. like a hellish bird song, there's a rhythm to it, a structure. they're clearly talking about something. under his breath, grant is able to mimic its patterns.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{what does that mean? what are you saying?}
<A>__{of course they can't answer. they just keep using the same "phrase." ready to ditch billy's camera bag in order to climb higher he's had to hold it by the strap grant finds his hand covered with a runny slime. he looks down at the camera bag, and that's the source. it's oozing out the bottom. he unzips the bag to find}
<B>__{a broken raptor egg}
<A>__{inside, the white and green yolk still dripping from the pieces of the shell. there's another intact egg beside it. this is what the raptors where chasing.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{god damn you, billy.}
<A>__{ever the scientist, dr. grant tests a theory even in the face of danger: he holds up the intact egg so that the raptors can see it. they suddenly go crazy, howling the same phrase but louder.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{it means, "give us the egg," doesn't it? "we want the egg."}
<A>__{he gently drops the bag to the ground. although the raptors are interested, pulling out the unbroken egg, they're still by no means placated. the song may have changed, but they still want grant dead. they begin to jump at him, eventually, hopping up on each others backs. it's only a matter of time till they reach him. grant moves to climb higher, but sees no branches he can reach. and than he hears the low creaking. a crack. the branch he's on is starting to give in. he looks down at the face of his enemies, knowing he'll be their next meal. and then,}
<B>__{a small canister}
<A>__{lands at the base of the trees, immediately spraying out a thick cloud of oily fog. it's the first of}
<B>__{five canisters}
<A>__{that land in the area, creating a thick cloud. it's not just smoke though something far more caustic. as it hits the raptors they immediately recoil, those closest to the canisters shrieking in pain. tumbling in the dirt. there may be a pheremonal element to the mist as well they seem panicked, disoriented. pack mentality takes over, and after the first ten raptors take off running, so do the rest, some tripping over their feet blindly. this may be dino tear gas, but it's not good for humans either. up in the tree, grant's eyes immediately burn from the vapor he squints to see through the fog, where he spots}
<B>__{a human shape}
<A>__{at the edge of the smoke}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{come on! they'll be back!}
<A>__{grant half climbs, half falls out of the tree, rushing to get through the heaviest of the smoke.}
