<L>__{interior romulan senate chamber night}
<A>__{picard and shinzon sit alone in a corner of the sweeping senate chamber. the remains of dinner before them.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{and when i was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. put a romulan agent at the heart of starfleet to influence your command structure. it was a bold plan.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{as happens so frequently here on romulus, a new government came to power. they decided to abandon the plan frankly, i think they were afraid i'd be discovered and it would lead to war. they weren't ready for that.}
<A>__{picard pours a glass of romulan ale.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{romulan ale i'm surprised. i can't stand it.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{you'll acquire a taste for it.}
<A>__{a beat. they look at each other.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{it's not quite the face you remember.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{not quite. i envy the hairline.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{a lifetime of violence will do that. my nose was broken four times. and my jaw... but so much is the same. the eyes, you recognize the eyes.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{yes. the eyes have it.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? yours are so confident.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{how did you end up on remus?}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{they sent me there to die. how could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? it was...}
<P>__{(he can't find the words)}
<D>__{... i was a slave. and a monster. the only thing the romulan guards hated more than the remans was me. but one man took pity on me: the man who became my viceroy. he taught me how to survive. and in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, i found my reman brothers. they showed me the only kindness i ever knew.}
<A>__{a beat. he glances to the romulan crest on the wall.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{for thousands of years the romulan senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister planet... but the time has come for us to live as equals.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{you're doing this to liberate the remans?}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{no race should be a slave to another.}
<A>__{picard is impressed with shinzon's quiet words.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{you don't trust me.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i have no reason to.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{of course you do. if you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... you'd be sitting where i am now. at least i hope you would.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{and if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great responsibility in representing the federation. i can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{all i have is my personal feelings. i wasn't raised with the ideals of the federation. but i'm trying to understand them now. to live up to them to live up to you.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{i want to know where i come from. the remans gave me a future. you can tell me about my past.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{there's so much, and so much of it is dull...}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{were we always explorers? plcard no. i was the first picard to leave earth. it caused quite a stir, in fact. but i had spent my whole life...}
<C>__{shinzon}
<P>__{(finishing the sentence)}
<D>__{looking up at the stars.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{and you dreamed about what was up there. about...}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(finishing the sentence)}
<D>__{new worlds.}
<A>__{a beat. they both reach for a carafe of water at the exact same instant. stop.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{after you, praetor.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{age before rank, jean luc.}
<A>__{picard smiles, pours a glass.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{so i'm not as tall as you expected?}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{i always hoped i would hit two meters.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{with a full head of hair.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{there is that.}
<A>__{a quiet beat.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{shinzon... i'm trying to believe you.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{if there's one ideal the federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. from the first time the vulcans came to earth we've sought a future of peace. nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friendship. in time. when trust has been earned.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{i'm honored to think i might someday speak with such eloquence.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{in time, jean luc.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{in time.}
