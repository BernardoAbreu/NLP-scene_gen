<L>__{interior bourne's car day}
<A>__{on his police radio, bourne singles out an nypd officer (call sign alpha 2503) racing toward the intersection just ahead. bourne slows, then speeds up quickly to time it right: the cri car almost hits his bumper, then has to accelerate through the upcoming intersection. as he does, the cop car bourne was listening to on the radio slams broadside into the cri sedan drafting the bumper of the mangled cop car. swerving wildly paz avoids the pileup and slams his heavy suv into the back of bourne's car, pushing him into the oncoming traffic. several cars swerve left and right as paz pushes bourne sideways onto the ramped end of a k rail dividing the street ahead. the nearly upended car grinds down the k rail until the rear of bourne's car strikes an obstruction which punches it back into the lane as it slams against the front of paz's suv, knocking the suv sideways, into a row of parked cars. bourne's car hits parked cars on the other side of the road. smoke and steam sirens chaos bourne kicks the window out of the police car. gun up... ready }
