<L>__{exterior coruscant, downtown, back street morning}
<A>__{obi wan walks down the street. it is a pretty tough part of town. old buildings, warehouses, beat up speeders and transporter rigs occasional "shiny freighters" hissing through. obi wan comes to a kind of alien diner. on the steamed up windowa it says "dex's diner" in alien lettering. he goes inside.}
<L>__{interior coruscant, dex's diner morning}
<A>__{a young waitress, hermione bagwa, is wiping off a booth tabletop. there is a counter with stools and a line of booths along the wall by the window. a number of customers are eating tough looking workers, freighter drivers etc. hermione looks up as obi wan comes in.}
<C>__{hermione}
<D>__{can i help ya? obi wan i'm looking for dexter.}
<A>__{hermione's eyes narrow.}
<C>__{hermione bagwa}
<D>__{waddya want him for? obi wan he's not in trouble. it's personal.}
<A>__{hermione stares at obi wan. there is a brief pause. then she goes to the open serving hatch behind the counter.}
<C>__{hermione bagwa}
<D>__{someone to see ya, honey}
<P>__{(lowering her voice)}
<D>__{a jedi, by the looks of him.}
<A>__{steam billows out from the kitchen hatch behind the counter as a huge head pokes through.}
<C>__{dexter jettster}
<D>__{obi wan! obi wan hey, dex.}
<C>__{dexter jettster}
<D>__{take a seat! be right with ya!}
<A>__{obi wan sits in a booth.}
<C>__{hermione bagwa}
<D>__{you want a cup of ardees? obi wan thank you.}
<A>__{hermione moves off as the door to the counter opens and dexter jettster appears. he is big bald and sweaty, old and alien. not someone to tangle with. he arrives, beaming hugely.}
<C>__{dexter jettster}
<D>__{hey, ol' buddy! obi wan hey, dex.}
<A>__{dexter eases himself into the seat opposite obi wan. he can just make it. hermione sets two mugs of steaming ardees in from of them.}
<C>__{dexter jettster}
<D>__{so, my friend. what can i do for ya? obi wan you can tell me what this is.}
<A>__{obi wan places the dart on the table between them. dex's eyes widen. he puts down his mug.}
<C>__{dexter jettster}
<D>__{well, whattaya know...}
<A>__{dexter picks up the dart delicately between his puffy fingers and peers at it.}
<C>__{dexter jettster}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i ain't seen one of these since i was prospecting on subterrel beyond the outer rim! obi wan do you know where it came from?}
<A>__{dexter grins. he puts the dart down between them.}
<C>__{dexter jettster}
<D>__{this baby belongs to them cloners. what you got here is a kamino kyberdart. obi wan kamino kyberdart... i wonder why it didn't show up in any analysis archive.}
<C>__{dexter jettster}
<D>__{it's these funny little cuts on the side give it away... those analysis droids you've got over there only focus on symbols, you know. i should think you jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom. obi wan well, dex, if droids could think, we wouldn't be here, would we?}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{kamino... doesn't sound familiar. is it part of the republic?}
<C>__{dexter jettster}
<D>__{no, it's beyond the outer rim. i'd say about twelve parsecs outside the rishi maze, toward the south. it should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archive to find. those kaminoans keep to themselves. they're cloners. damned good ones, too.}
<A>__{obi wan then picks up the dart, holding it midway between them.}
<D>__{obi wan cloners? are they friendly?}
<C>__{dexter jettster}
<D>__{it depends. obi wan on what, dex?}
<A>__{dexter grins.}
<C>__{dexter jettster}
<D>__{on how good your manners are... and how big your pocketbook is...}
