<L>__{interior train. pre dawn}
<A>__{various passengers, huddled uncomfortably, cold, asleep. on paul hood, 15 and a half, stoner preppie look, hunched up in his seat under the faint emergency exit light. he reads his fantastic four comic book by the pale light of the emergency exit sign. suddenly, the lights begin to flicker on and the hum of the train's engines returns. the conductor enters the car, blasting forth in his classic nasal voice.}

<A>__{he moves on to the next car. the train begins to move. paul rubs his elbow against the window and looks out into the still dark early morning. he looks back down at his comic book. on the comic book: reed richards (also known as stretch) has zapped his young son with a cosmic ray gun to neutralize the destructive energy that annihilus has implanted in him. the thing, medusa, flame, and richards' wife sue storm look on, stunned. "then you've turned him into a vegetable. your own son." "don't you see, sue? he was too}

<D>__{in issue number 141 of the fantastic four, published in november 1973, reed richards has to use his anti matter weapon on his own son, who annihilus has turned into a human atom bomb. his son is the result of richards' coupling with the earthling sue storm, and the problem is that the cosmic rays that infused richards and the rest of the fantastic four on their aborted moon mission have made young franklin a volatile mixture of matter and anti matter.}

<D>__{and that's what it is to come from a family, if you analyze it closely. each of them is negative matter for the other ones. and that's what dying is dying is when your family, which is in fact your personal negative matter from which you emerge it's when the family takes you back, thus hurling you back into negative space...}

<D>__{flame on, asshole.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{and remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned.}

<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{it's freezing.}
<C>__{mikey}
<P>__{(pausing)}
<D>__{yeah. when it freezes, i guess that means the molecules are not moving. so when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. the molecules have stopped. so it's clean.}

<A>__{her head bobs and weaves, her eyes close, and suddenly her head falls forward with a whoosh toward the couch smack dab between paul's legs. she begins to snore instantly, her open mouth nuzzling into his crotch. paul doesn't move, doesn't even breathe. then, slowly, he leans his back into the couch, without shifting the rest of his body. he looks as though he has simultaneously won the lottery and received a lobotomy.}

<A>__{elena steps forward. benjamin is obviously agitated. close on janey's hands selecting away from ben's equine key ring. she lifts up another key ring neil conrad, the teenager. she hands the self important looking neil his keys and they turn to go. jim williams smiles mysteriously to himself. ben suddenly lurches forward, semi drunkenly, trying to separate neil from janey.}

<D>__{hey hey ben, hang on there a sec.}
<A>__{he backs off, ashamed, and, taking a step backwards, trips over the coffee table. mark boland helps lift him up.}

<C>__{elena}
<D>__{let me.}
<A>__{she takes the bowl and dips her hand in. two sets are left. one, her own, she avoids. she takes out jim's keys and walks across the room, handing them to him.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{thanks, but oh, i don't think so. it's been kind of a discouraging evening.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{you couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{somehow it was different in my imagination when i thought about it. actually, i didn't think about it at all, really.}
<A>__{they sit down on the sofa.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you want coffee or something?}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen }
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{look, elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{my husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. i've been married to him for 17 years and i don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what i'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, i'm proposing that you and i do what makes sense. stay warm. pass some time. that's all.}

<D>__{okay. shall we clean up around here first? do you think it's all right }
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{nah, that wasn't in the contract.}
<A>__{but they still walk around turning off lights. in the hallway, elena looks a bit mournfully at the light seeping from underneath the bathroom door. she hears the sound of running water from inside. then she goes into a sideroom and joins jim. they pick up their coats.}

<C>__{elena}
<D>__{do these seats go back?}
<A>__{that starts it. he jumps at her, unbuckling her and unzipping himself. they tangle uncomfortably for a few seconds. and then, comically, he's in her. with a groan, it's over in a flash. jim pulls himself off, readjusting his pants.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{that was awful, really awful. i'm so sorry, elena.}
<A>__{elena has somehow worked herself into the cavity of the glove compartment, and is trying to figure out how to extricate herself.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{things are really rotten at home. you wouldn't believe how rotten. janey's sick. she's unstable, i guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it it's like i can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't }
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{jim, maybe we should just go. i've got to look in on the kids. paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.}

<A>__{she fills the glass to the brim and hands the bottle to sandy. they clink and each toss back a sip wendy almost the entire glass. sandy coughs and gags, but swallows.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{try again.}
<A>__{he does.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{it feels warm.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{one more shot?}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{they drink.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{under the covers.}
<A>__{under they go, and soon every layer of clothing emerges.}
<C>__{wendy}
<P>__{(feeling her way)}
<D>__{get 'em off.}
<A>__{sandy begins to laugh, and soon wendy joins him. they roll around on top of each other for a while.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{have you ever had a nocturnal emission?}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{that's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff, like after a sexy dream.}
<A>__{sandy shakes his head.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{they didn't tell you this stuff yet? what planet do you live on?}
<A>__{sandy doesn't answer, but climbs back on top of her and kisses her neck.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{i love you.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{that's nice. are you drunk?}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{i don't know. how do i know?}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{i don't know either. you spin around, when you lie down.}
<A>__{sandy rolls off her and lies on his back.}
<C>__{sandy }
<D>__{i don't think i'm spinning.}
<A>__{they cuddle up together. he yawns. she yawns.}
<L>__{exterior silver meadow. night}
<A>__{mikey walks along the edge of the empty pool in the rain. he climbs up on the diving board and bounces lightly on it, but then gets off and stands, looking down at the pool again.}
<L>__{exterior silver meadow. night}
<A>__{mikey walks across the field.}
<L>__{exterior street. night}
<A>__{the storm has let up. mikey walks along. with a running start, he slides on the ice down a hill. he walks back up and slides again, hollering with joy. he is an image of a tiny yet absolute and positive freedom. the streetlights sputter on, then off.}
<L>__{interior williams guest room. night}
<A>__{sandy and wendy lie asleep.}
<L>__{exterior street. night}
<A>__{a power line is down. it hisses and hums a humming very much like the humming mikey has been hearing earlier. the humming takes on the same transcendent tonality to which mikey has become so accustomed at such moments. mikey sits down on a metal street guardrail, to ponder the sound and the snaking coil of electricity. a strange look of almost religious wonder overcomes his face, as the power line connects to the guardrail.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{oh shit.}
<A>__{glued by an electrical pulse to the rail, he shakes as the current flows through him. after a minute, his body slumps and slides down the road.}
<L>__{interior train. night}
<A>__{as paul sits reading on he moving train, the lights inside begin to sputter, and the train begins to slow. after a few moments, the train grinds to a halt, and paul and his few fellow late night passengers are left in near total dark, with only the light of an emergency exit sign above paul's head to light the scene. the train is eerily silent.}
<L>__{exterior hood car. night}
<A>__{ben drives home.}
<L>__{exterior street. night}
<A>__{an emergency vehicle, lights flashing, crawls by ben's car. he drives on slowly.}

<A>__{jim and elena arrive on foot.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you want to come in, get a cup of coffee warm up? i can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{sure. maybe coffee.}
<L>__{interior williams kitchen. pre dawn}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{phone's out. i hope the pipe's }
<A>__{he walks into the kitchen. the pipes have begun to burst. there's a water leak running down the walls, forming a puddle on the floor. elena has walked into the kitchen behind him. she leans against the counter, picking up the garter belt without thinking for a second, then putting it back down.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{oh well. why don't you put on some dry socks and we've got some rain boots in the guest closet back there. last room upstairs back of the hall.}
<A>__{elena climbs the stairs in her bare feet.}
<L>__{interior williams guest room. cont'd}
<A>__{elena opens the door, and discovers wendy and sandy asleep. she stands before the bed, and gazes down on them. they look almost angelic. wendy, sensing her presence in the room, opens her eyes, slowly coming out of sleep.}
<C>__{elena}
<P>__{(heartbroken, softly)}
<D>__{get dressed.}
<A>__{elena walks out of the room, back to the kitchen. wendy gets out of bed quietly, leaving sandy sleeping peacefully. she looks at him lovingly, and tucks the blanket back up around him.}
<L>__{interior williams kitchen. dawn}
<A>__{elena and jim are drinking coffee.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{you should let him sleep.}
<A>__{wendy enters. she looks inquisitively at the two adults.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{where's dad?}
<L>__{interior hood car. dawn}
<A>__{ben continues to drive slowly. he looks out his side window, and sees something. he puts on his brakes.}
<L>__{exterior street. dawn}
<A>__{ben gets out of the car, and stands on the top of an icy embankment. in a clump of bushes is the orange glow of a parka. he walks hesitantly toward it. mike's body lies face down in the wet ice. ben leans down and turns the body over, then stands back in amazement and saddened shock. he stands there for a moment, then picks mike's body up, carrying him over the hill and onto the street. we see now that he is parked just a short block from the williams's house. he bypasses his car and walks directly down the street toward the house. the effort is obviously enormous. he falls from time to time, then gets back up.}
<L>__{interior train. pre dawn}
<A>__{various passengers asleep. paul, hunched up in his seat under the faint emergency exit light, cold. he reads his comic book by the light of the emergency exit. "don't you see, sue? he was too}
<B>__{powerful... if his energy had}
<A>__{destroyed the world!" suddenly, the lights begin to flicker on and the hum of the train's engines returns. the conductor enters the car, blasting forth in his classic nasal train conductor voice.}
<C>__{conductor}
<D>__{good morning ladies and gentlemen }
<A>__{on paul, squinting in the harsh light.}
<L>__{exterior train bridge. pre dawn}
<A>__{the train moves slowly through a suburban, semi forested landscape. on the street below the bridge, an emergency highway crew is removing a fallen tree, their trucks aglow in flashing yellow lights.}

<A>__{elena pours wendy a cup of coffee. they're both in their coats.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{i don't like coffee.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{it'll warm you up.}
<A>__{elena sits next to her. they both raise their cups and sip the coffee, not noticing the simultaneity of their movements.}
<L>__{interior guest room. dawn}
<A>__{jim watches the sleeping sandy, picks up the half empty bottle of vodka, pours himself a drink. the noise wakes sandy up. jim sits down on the bed at his feet and takes a sip.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{dad?}
<A>__{jim looks at him.}
<L>__{interior kitchen. dawn}
<A>__{elena and wendy hear a hollering from outside, get up to see what it is.}

<A>__{elena and wendy come out the front door, as ben lays mikey's body onto the ground before the front steps.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{ben?}
<A>__{he's too breathless to speak. they stand there, looking down at mikey. behind elena and wendy, jim appears. he pushes softly by them toward the body of his son.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{jim he was just up in silver lane i think maybe a power line }
<A>__{jim picks up his son. he carries him silently into the house. sandy, now standing inside the foyer, pushes himself back against the wall as they pass, without expression. after a moment, from outside, the hoods can hear jim's wailing.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{do you think? maybe we should call someone }
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{the phone's out.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{yeah. well, we can just }
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{ben, i don't think he wants us here.}

<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{wait, i }
<A>__{she turns back up the front steps and gently goes in }
<L>__{interior williams living room. cont'd}
<A>__{on the living room floor, jim is hugging mike's body, his shoulders shaking uncontrollably, sobbing. wendy walks and stands next to sandy, who is filled momentarily with a brief inexplicable rush of anger toward her but she takes him and gives him an awkward, childlike hug, then turns and runs out the door, joining ben and elena on the driveway. sandy watches her go, his face wet with tears.}

<C>__{elena}
<D>__{oh you know, for a minute i thought it was }
<C>__{ben}

<C>__{ben}
<D>__{c'mon.}
<L>__{exterior street. dawn}
<A>__{elena, wendy, and ben reach the car and get in. the car starts and drives off. there are more crews out cleaning up the storm's debris and fixing the power lines as they drive.}
<L>__{exterior conrail station. early morning}
<A>__{the train slowly pulls in. the hood family walks down to the end of the platform. the train doors open, and paul, tired and a bit cramped, emerges. he sees his family gathered at the other end of the platform, and walks to them. they stand, silent, even dignified, awaiting him. when he joins them they all walk silently to the car and get in.}
<L>__{interior hood car. early morning}
<A>__{sunlight floods in and temporarily blinds ben as he starts the engine. he squints, his eyes tearing a bit from the light. he looks around, first at his wife, then at his two children sitting in the back seat. he turns off the engine. quietly, he begins to cry. he turns to the back seat.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{there's something your mother and i have to tell you two }
