<A>__{but someplace completely different. older. dark. empty. echoey. a fluorescent bulb sputtering out. footsteps approaching... it's kevin. and we know instantly that mary ann is dead. there's blood on his shirt. his eyes are raw. at his side, a small suitcase containing her personal effects. more than grief, more than shock, what we notice most is his frighteningly grim determination. up ahead, a bench. mrs. lomax huddled here. cried out. empty. holding herself more tightly as he sets down the suitcase.}

<C>__{mrs. lomax}
<D>__{i promised right there if god would let me back into his grace i would never leave again. i prayed there was a reason this terrible thing had happened. there had to be a reason. and there was. it was you. you were my blessing. you were reason enough to endure anything. how much i love you.}
