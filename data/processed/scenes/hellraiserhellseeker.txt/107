<D>__{they were all real screamers too. we had a blast. and there was one more. you've seen many things you wished you hadn't. many nightmares from which you never awoke. they were all clues in our little puzzle. can you guess now trevor? can you guess the fifth soul chosen for us to torment in this little agreement?}
<A>__{the lights flicker overhead, reddening with each strobe. hundreds of those little sewer monsters come slithering out of the cracks in the walls, racing toward trevor. he doesn't care.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{what's under the sheet?}
<C>__{pinhead}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{welcome to the worst nightmare of them all, trevor. reality.}
<A>__{pinhead grabs the sheet and whips it back. trevor's jaw drops in disbelief. it's trevor's body. it is blue, bloated and mutilated. the corpse's skull has a massive crack in it.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{no... no... flash back:}
