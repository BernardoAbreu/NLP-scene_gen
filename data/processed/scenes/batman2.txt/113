<L>__{interior penguin's lair day}
<A>__{the penguin stands over his indoor penguin pool. he's wearing rubber gloves, feeding live fish from an ice chest to his arctic birds. the vents in the windows are open, and the climate in the room is downright icy as selina's wrapped in fur, stroking her pet cat:}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{he's just another rich idiot.}
<P>__{(chuckling to herself)}
<D>__{the odd thing is, he didn't seem a bit concerned.}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{then he is an idiot.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{he lives in some big sprawling manor. i will have to get inside, scope it out... see where he's got the raven stashed.}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{how do you plan to do that?}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{how do you think!}
<A>__{a feline smile from selina. the penguin chuckles to himself, lobs a fish out over the pool. a swooping gull snatches it out of the air before it hits the water. frick arrives in the doorway.}
<C>__{frick}
<D>__{it's mr. provost, sir. he's planning to embark on an unscheduled christmas vacation.}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{good! that should save us a trip to the bank.}
