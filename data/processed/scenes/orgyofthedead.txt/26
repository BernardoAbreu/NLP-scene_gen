<L>__{exterior cemetery, night}
<A>__{criswell nods repeatedly, smiling at the dancer in approval. the street walker's clothes have suddenly disappeared. bob and shirley creep beneath the bushes, crouched down low. they reach the edge of the clearing where criswell and the princess of darkness are watching the street walker dance.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{could it be some kind of college initiation?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{it's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and i know them. nothing alive looks like that!}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{can't we get out of here?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i'm not sure...}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i'm not sure, myself. it's just a feeling i've had since the crash...like i feel a cold chill all over.. ..now this!}
<A>__{the street walker dances with a skeleton that is hanging by the door of the mausoleum. the street walker dance ends.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{i would see for approval, the one who in life worshipped gold above all else.}
<A>__{the princess of darkness points dramatically toward the mausoleum again to start off the next dance. the giants walk to the doors, now wearing red and white horizontal striped miniskirts (or ancient egyptian garb?). they pull the iron doors open slowly, and we see the gold girl dancer lying on her back on the altar inside.}
<C>__{shirley}
<P>__{(pointing toward the mausoleum)}
<D>__{look!}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{be careful! they'll see you.}
<A>__{the gold girl dancer rises slowly and seductively from the table, then stalkingly dances out into the clearing. she is wearing a metallic gold tunic like dress. we see a shot of bob and shirley watching, and suddenly the gold girl's dress has disappeared. the gold girl dance continues.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{throw gold at her.}
<A>__{the giants pick up a bucket of gold doubloons and begin slowly sprinkling them over the gold girl as she dances. she sits on the ground and reaches for the falling coins.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{more gold.}
<A>__{the giants continue dropping gold coins on the gold girl. she picks up the gold coins, rubbing them over her body, in ecstasy.}
<C>__{criswell}
<P>__{(excitedly)}
<D>__{more gold!}
<A>__{the giants continue, to the delight of criswell. the gold girl tries to scoop all the scattered coins closer to her.}
<C>__{criswell}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{more gold!}
<A>__{the giants continue. criswell is thrilled, and begins to laugh loudly.}
<C>__{criswell}
<P>__{(to the princess)}
<D>__{for all eternity, she shall have gold.}
<A>__{the princess of darkness laughs in acknowledgement, then claps her hands twice, commanding the giants to finish the ceremony. the giants walk toward the gold girl, who is still on the ground playing with the gold coins and rubbing them on her body. the giants pick up the gold girl, who resists, trying to maintain contact with the gold. she reaches for it as they lift her up. closeup of a bubbling giant cauldron full of a substance that is supposed to look like gold. the giants dip the gold girl feet first into the cauldron, submerging her entire body. a few seconds later, the giants lift the gold girl out of the cauldron. her body is now entirely gilded, and she is stiff. they lift her onto their shoulders, carrying her like a board, walking in front of criswell's throne, then back into the mausoleum, laying her body on the altar. we see bob and shirley, looking dismayed.}
<C>__{criswell }
<D>__{and both couldn't help but remember a line from one of bob's stories: "a sudden wind howls. the night things are all about me. every shadow, a beckoning invitation...to disaster. i know i should think of other things, of pleasant things, but i can't. how can i think of other things, of pleasant things, when i am in a place surrounded by shadows and objects, which can take any shape, here in the darkness...any shape my mind can conceive."}
<A>__{deep in the woods, we see the wolf man and the mummy, walking quickly. suddenly, bob and shirley are grabbed from behind by the wolf man and the mummy. the wolf man and the mummy drag bob and shirley over to the clearing near criswell's throne. the princess of darkness is now seated at criswell's right side with him on his throne.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{bring 'em in!}
<A>__{the princess of darkness stands and walks to the end of the altar below criswell's throne, then sits on the lower seat at the end of the altar and crosses her legs. the wolf man and the mummy drag bob and shirley over to the center of the clearing to face criswell, the sole ruler of the dark world.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{they are live ones?}
<C>__{the mummy}
<P>__{(with audible tape hiss added)}
<D>__{yes, master.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{live ones where only the dead should be?}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{yes, master, and we caught them, him and me.}
<A>__{the mummy motions toward the wolf man.}
<C>__{the wolf man}
<D>__{wwwwooooooaaaaaaauuuuugggghhhhahaaaa!!!}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{you shall both be rewarded.}
<P>__{(to princess)}
<D>__{my dear empress of the night, put these intruders to the test.}
<A>__{medium shot of princess of darkness. (suddenly the princess of darkness is beside the throne again, several feet from the seat at the foot of the altar)}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{but they are not yet one of us.}
<C>__{criswell}
<P>__{(happily)}
<D>__{a situation easily remedied.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{tie them that they may watch.}
