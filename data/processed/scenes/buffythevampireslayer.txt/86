<A>__{we see the entire cave, the still pool of blood, the torches lit. at the far end sits lothos. in his arms is the body of a dead girl. blood stains her neck and yet the image is poetic, reminiscent of michelangelo's "pieta". they are both perfectly still, her draped across his lap, he with his eyes far far away. the silence holds. lothos belches massively.}
