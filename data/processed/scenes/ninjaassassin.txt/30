<L>__{exterior berlin street night.}
<A>__{mika walks down the empty street, the sound of her heels slap against the stone buildings. the shadows seem to stalk her. she hears a faint sound like metal claws against glass. she stops and listens trying to see into the dark.}

<L>__{interior istanbul raizo's apartment day}
<A>__{raizo is practicing his chain form. we begin to hear the sounds of another fight. flashback interior orphanage dojo night raizo, is fighting with takeshi, a few years older, in a room lit by hundreds of hanging torches. armed with katanas, the boys duck, dodge and weave around the burning obstacles as they fight. they are both extremely agile, their bodies moving with the impossible flexibility of youth. kiriko watches along with the other members of the clan. if she feels anything as she watches the fight, we cannot tell. they perform a vicious series of combinations, then takeshi's sword cracks against raizo's head, opening a huge gash. raizo hits the ground hard, blood speckling the mats. takeshi backs away as ozunu steps in. as blood flows down the side of his face, raizo looks like the young boy that he is. pain throbs from the wound, and he begins to cry.}
<C>__{ozunu}
<D>__{did takeshi's blow hurt you? you think this is pain? you are mistaken.}
<A>__{he gouges three fingers into the boy's stomach and twists something inside of him. raizo screams. his screams smear into uncontrollable sobbing.}
<C>__{ozunu }
<D>__{that is true pain. you must learn to live with it.}
<A>__{he steps back, leaving raizo writhing in agony.}
<C>__{ozunu }
<D>__{this is your first test. survive the night.}
<A>__{he signals to the rest of the clan and they all begin to leave. kiriko is the last to turn away.}
