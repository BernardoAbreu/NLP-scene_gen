<A>__{high above sarah, we see she is standing alone in a three story kiln house, a windowless shed used for firing pottery and other construction projects. catwalks lined with heavy chains hang above her, and onto the floor below, she turns in circles, wondering what to do now. from outside the kiln house, she hears scratching, digging sounds. from the other side of the door comes an animal snort, and a small puff of dust and dirt billows up through the crack along the ground. on the other side of the door, the claws of one of the raptors dig furiously, trying to tunnel underneath. inside, sarah runs to the opposite wall, falls to her knees, and starts digging a tunnel of her own, clawing frantically at the ganging tools always and clanks as it tears at the earth below it. sarah digs faster. so does the raptor. with about eight inches of space under the wall, sarah grabs hold of the bottom of one of the plans and pries it up as hard as she can. it snaps off with a loud crack. at the door, the raptor stops digging. it's silent for a moment. sarah has a good foot and a half of space under her wall now. she starts to lower her body into it just as the raptor's claws flash through from the other side! sarah falls back, screaming, leaps to her feet, and jumps up, grabbing hold of one of the catwalks above. she starts to climb, up, anywhere up, as the raptor now squirms and thrashes its way inside, coming in through her hole. sarah climbs, hauling herself up, leaping from one catwalk to another. the raptor leaps up onto a catwalk as well and follows her.}
