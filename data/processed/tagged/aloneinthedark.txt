<A>__{a dense forest on a dark, misty night. young edward carnby (age 10), small, thin, and terrified, runs for his life.}
<L>__{2}
<A>__{the forest is pitch black. young edward ducks between trees, under branches, not stopping for anything, gasping for breath. he doesn't turn to look behind him. he just runs as fast as he can. p.o.v. creature: tomething chases young edward through the dark forest. its p.o.v. is skewed, inhuman. it is gaining on him. as young edward runs, beams of light become visible through the closely packed trees. something is up ahead, something bright. edward runs towards it. young edward bursts out into a clearing in the woods, running towards the bright light. p.o.v. creature: the light stops whatever is chasing young edward at the edge of the forest. what is making the light isn't visible, only young edward's silhouette running towards the blinding light.}
<L>__{exterior forest later that night 1a}
<A>__{super: 20 years ago the beams of a dozen flashlights cut through the mist of the dark forest. a dozen uniformed deputies move through the forest, shining their flashlights around, searching. the trees tower over them. a low fog hangs in the air. the flashlight beams can barely penetrate it.}
<L>__{exterior orphanage night}
<A>__{a large and stately old house stands on the edge of town. a small, dense forest stretches out behind it. the sign on the front reads: our lady of perpetual light}
<B>__{orphanage.}
<A>__{several patrol cars are parked along the orphanage's gravel driveway. deputies mill around the front lawn. another patrol car pulls up. out of it steps the sheriff (late 40s). deputy adams (mid 30s) approaches him.}

<D>__{what's going on, adams?}
<C>__{deputy adams}
<D>__{twenty kids live at this orphanage, sheriff. all twenty have gone missing.}
<A>__{sister clara (mid 40s), an anxious looking nun, stands on the front porch, wrapped in a shawl. she speaks with two deputies. the sheriff walks up and listens in.}
<C>__{sister clara}
<D>__{after the power went out, i went to check on the children. but their beds were empty. every one of them. they just disappeared...}
<L>__{exterior forest later 3}
<A>__{the deputies sweep through the forest with their flashlights. the trees are close together, blocking out the moonlight. a thick mist hangs in the trees. as deputy adams moves through the forest, he sees a bright light streaming through the trees up ahead.}
<L>__{exterior forest clearing 3a}
<A>__{deputy adams comes through the trees and emerges into a clearing in the woods. he sees a shed in the clearing up ahead. a bright light is posted over the shed's front entrance.}
<L>__{4 exterior shed moments later}
<A>__{deputy adams shines his flashlight around the outside of the shed. he sees that the door is open just a crack. on the door is a sign marked: danger, along with the symbol for electricity.}
<L>__{interior shed moments later 5}
<A>__{deputy adams enters the shed. the shed is small, packed with electrical equipment, power cables, and various implements for repairing power lines. deputy adams sweeps through the shed with his flashlight. he approaches a large transformer module that sits at the back of the shed. it hums and crackles with electricity. there's a low shuffling sound. deputy adams stops. he carefully peers around behind the transformer. the space is too small for a full size person. but sitting on the ground behind the transformer is young edward. he clutches himself, shivering, frightened.}
<L>__{exterior orphanage 6}
<A>__{the sheriff stands with his deputies. his walkie talkie crackles to life.}
<P>__{deputy adams (on the walkie talkie)}
<D>__{sheriff! i found one! white, male, about ten years old. looks to be unharmed. he's in a utility shed maybe half a mile from the orphanage.}
<L>__{interior shed 7}
<A>__{deputy adams approaches young edward. he takes off his jacket and wraps it around young edward's shoulders. young edward pulls the jacket around him and smiles, still scared, but happy to see the deputy.}
<C>__{deputy adams}
<D>__{are you okay, son? are the other kids around here?}
<C>__{young edward}
<D>__{i don't know... i don't remember...}

<L>__{interior airplane day 8}
<A>__{super: 20 years later edward carnby (early 30s), lean and intense, wakes up. he quickly looks around to get his bearings. he sits in a large commercial airplane. the compartment is full of seated passengers. small boy (age 8) sits next to carnby, looking up at him. the small boy's mother (early 40s) sleeps next to him.}
<C>__{small boy}
<D>__{did you have a nightmare?}
<A>__{carnby looks at the small boy, curious. he doesn't respond.}
<C>__{small boy }
<D>__{you ate cheese with dinner. my mommy says cheese gives you nightmares. want to see my coloring book?}
<A>__{the small boy has a halloween themed coloring book open on his lap. it's a graveyard scene, full of cartoon drawings of ghosts, werewolves, and vampires.}
<C>__{small boy }
<D>__{i think there's a vampire living in my closet, but my mommy says vampires and ghosts aren't real. she says there's nothing to be afraid of in the dark.}
<A>__{carnby weighs what he's going to say.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{your mother is wrong. being afraid of the dark is what keeps most of us alive.}
<A>__{the small boy's eyes open wide.}
<C>__{small boy}
<D>__{everybody else tells me not to be afraid.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{that's because they don't know the truth.}
<L>__{exterior airport terminal day 13}
<A>__{carnby exits the terminal and heads over to a row of taxis waiting outside the terminal. he doesn't carry a suitcase.}
<C>__{carnby }
<D>__{so, maybe you're thinking i'm an asshole, trying to scare this poor kid for no reason. but that's where you're wrong. because i've got my reasons. there's a world around you that you've trained yourself not to see. you've willfully closed your eyes. but your fear of the dark is not a weakness. it's there to protect you from things you'd better pray you never see. my eyes were forced open a long time ago. now i know. just because you can't see something, doesn't mean it can't kill you.}
<A>__{carnby steps into the first taxi waiting in the row. the taxi shifts into gear and drives off. another taxi is parked up ahead. as carnby's taxi passes it, the second taxi pulls out and follows it.}

<L>__{interior carnby's taxi 13c}
<A>__{the cabbie (late 20s), manic bordering on crazy, steers through traffic. carnby rides in the backseat. he looks out the back windshield. a few cars back, pinkerton's taxi follows them. carnby takes a burlap sack out of his trench coat pocket. inside the sack is a stone carving of a demonic looking head. the edges are soft, worn down, the detail roughed away. but it is clearly not a human face. carnby puts the carving back in his trench coat pocket.}
<C>__{cabbie}
<D>__{you travel light.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{trust me, i'm carrying enough baggage for the both of us.}

<C>__{cabbie}
<D>__{no shit? want me to lose him?}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{if you can...}
<A>__{the cabbie guns the motor and speeds off.}
<L>__{13cc exterior city streets 13cc}
<A>__{carnby's taxi accelerates down the street, pulling away from pinkerton's taxi. as soon as it's evident that they are on to him, pinkerton's taxi speeds up to give chase. the two taxis rocket down the streets, swerving past cars, screeching around corners. carnby's taxi speeds down the streets, narrowly avoiding collisions with other cars and pedestrians. pinkerton just plows through whatever's in his way, smashing past other cars, forcing pedestrians to jump out of the way. pinkerton accelerates and tries to force carnby's taxi off the road. the taxi's grind against one another. carnby's taxi screeches around a corner, speeding into a side street that leads to the market street.}
<L>__{exterior market street 13d}
<A>__{a busy street crowded with pedestrians, open shops, and produce stalls. carnby's taxi races down the busy market street, followed by pinkerton. they swerve and screech down the street, cutting off other cars, and narrowly avoiding pedestrians. but then pinkerton's taxi zooms up beside carnby's taxi and bumps into it with a grinding crush of metal. not stopping, pinkerton's taxi continues to grind into carnby's taxi. the momentum pushes carnby's taxi around sideways. pinkerton's taxi then slams carnby's sideways taxi into a parked car with a crush of metal and shattering glass. there's a moment as carnby, trapped inside the crushed taxi and pinkerton, flooring the accelerator to add more pressure, exchange a look. pinkerton's expression is fierce. pinkerton gears the taxi into reverse, backing up in order to smash into carnby's taxi again. the cabbie is trapped by the crushed front of the taxi. his face is covered with a spiderweb of deep cuts. the cabbie struggles to get loose.}
<C>__{cabbie}
<D>__{i'm trapped, man!}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{i will draw him away...}
<A>__{as pinkerton's taxi backs up, it crashes into a van driving by, knocking it over onto its side and spilling the contents of the van onto the street. this gives carnby the brief moment he needs to extract himself from the crushed taxi. he wrenches himself out the window, just in time to see pinkerton's taxi accelerating towards him. carnby bolts away from the crushed taxi and the trapped cabbie. pinkerton immediately swerves his taxi, aiming it right for the running carnby. pinkerton's taxi rockets towards him. carnby leaps out of the way as pinkerton's taxi crashes into the side of a building, narrowly missing him. pinkerton's taxi is crumpled in a crash of metal and glass. carnby narrowly avoids being crushed between the taxi and the building. with fluid grace, carnby rolls to safety, landing on his feet. with a quick look back over his shoulder at pinkerton in his crumpled taxi, carnby runs. pinkerton steps out of his taxi, seemingly unhurt by the crash. he looks around, but can't see carnby anywhere on the street. pinkerton runs for an iron wrought staircase that leads up to a pedestrian bridge that hangs over the street. at the top of the pedestrian bridge, pinkerton looks up and down the street. he spots carnby, running through the crowd of pedestrians. pinkerton leaps off the pedestrian bridge, arcing through the air with superhuman force. pinkerton tackles the running carnby to the ground, slamming into him with a tremendous impact. but carnby is quick. he takes the hit and spins pinkerton around with a martial arts kick. the kick sends pinkerton crashing through the front window of a bakery.}
<L>__{interior bakery 13e}
<A>__{pinkerton comes crashing through the display window, landing in a pile of sticky buns and broken glass. but seemingly unfazed, he just picks himself up and walks back out the front door.}
<L>__{exterior market street 13f}
<A>__{carnby stands in a crowd of bystanders, watching in surprise as pinkerton exits the bakery, his expression fierce. pinkerton immediately spots carnby and comes after him. carnby bolts away, running into a herbalist store across the street.}
<L>__{interior herbalist store 13g}
<A>__{jars of different shapes and sizes containing a variety of medicinal herbs and other such substances are on display. carnby runs into the herbalist store, making his way through the displays. pinkerton leaps right through the herbalist store's front display window in a hail of shattered glass. he tackles carnby, crashing through the jars on display. pinkerton slams carnby to the ground. he grabs carnby's head and smashes it against the floor once, then twice. pinkerton tears open carnby's trench coat. he pulls out the burlap sack. he opens the sack, confirming the stone carving is inside it. while pinkerton inspects the stone carving, carnby's hand quietly moves to a large glass jar lying next to them. carnby smashes the glass jar over pinkerton's face. he grabs the stone carving out of pinkerton's hand, scrambles to his feet, and runs.}
<L>__{exterior alley 13h}
<A>__{carnby bursts out of the herbalist store's back door, exiting out into a small, cluttered alley. carnby lands hard in the debris, but he rolls with the fall and is back up on his feet, running. the alley ends in a high wall with a billboard on top of it. the wall has a railing along one side. carnby vaults over the railing and keeps running. the alley is crowded with workers unloading crates out of the loading dock of the ice factory. a beat cop walks by. carnby runs past the beat cop, just barely bumping into him. but as carnby passes him, he deftly grabs the beat cop's gun from his holster. the beat cop doesn't even notice his gun is missing as he turns, annoyed to see carnby racing away.}
<C>__{beat cop}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{pinkerton runs out of the herbalist store's back door. he runs directly at the high wall. pinkerton leaps up, scrambling right up the side of the wall. he hauls himself up the billboard, until he's standing at the top of the billboard itself. pinkerton looks down below and spots carnby running into the loading dock of the ice factory. pinkerton leaps off the billboard. the beat cop looks up, stunned to see pinkerton leaping towards him. pinkerton lands on top of a moving dolly of crates, crushing the crates on it. the worker pushing the dolly falls back, shocked. pinkerton leaps off the dolly and keeps chasing after carnby. the beat cop fumbles for his gun. it's not there. pinkerton smashes the beat cop out of the way as he pursues carnby. the beat cop flies into a pile of crates, knocked out. pinkerton follows carnby into the ice factory.}
<L>__{interior ice factory 13j}
<A>__{the refrigerated ice factory is filled with neat rows of ice blocks. factory workers mill about, transporting the blocks of ice through the factory. carnby hides between the rows of ice blocks. he checks the beat cop's gun to make sure it's loaded. it is. carnby stops, sensing something. in one fluid motion, carnby suddenly spins, turning in the other direction and firing the gun. we follow the bullet as it rockets through the ice factory. it whizzes along, until we see carnby's intended target. pinkerton comes through the ice factory, running at carnby. the bullet flies directly at him. the bullet hits pinkerton in the shoulder. but it only seems to anger pinkerton further. he keeps running at carnby. pinkerton leaps at carnby. carnby fires again. but pinkerton dodges the bullet and it hits a block of ice, shattering it in a hail of ice shards. pinkerton rolls with his dodge and races off into the stacks of ice blocks. carnby tries to track pinkerton's movements through the ice stacks. he hears the sound of pinkerton moving, but can't see him. his gun is ready. he searches around. suddenly, there's a rush of movement behind him. carnby dodges just as pinkerton's fist comes flying out. pinkerton connects with an ice block, shattering it. carnby is backed into a dead end in the ice factory. he turns to face pinkerton, gun ready. but pinkerton is on him too quickly. he lunges at carnby, hoisting him over his head and slamming him down on a conveyer belt. pinkerton drags carnby along the conveyer belt. but carnby grabs a hanging chain to steady himself. with a quick kick, carnby uses the momentum to flip pinkerton over him. pinkerton flies through the air towards a large ice pick wedged into the wall. the sharp point of the ice pick punches right through pinkerton's torso, impaling him. he is immediately killed. carnby leans up against the wall, steadying himself. he pulls the stone carving out of his pocket to check it. in the fight, the carving has been cracked into pieces. but the broken carving reveals something hidden inside it, a small gold artifact that was concealed in the carving. the artifact is a gold circle, flat on the top and bottom, its thick round side engraved with intricate abkani symbols. this is the lynchpin artifact, the piece which connects the other artifacts together.}

<A>__{a tremendous explosion rocks the shaft. a swirling geyser of flame shoots up towards the top of the shaft.}
<L>__{exterior orphanage dawn}
<A>__{carnby and aline dive out of the shaft just in time. the geyser of flame erupts out of the storm cellar. the shock wave knocks them to the ground. a cloud of dust swirls up out of the shaft.}

<L>__{interior orphanage children's room}
<A>__{carnby and aline stand at the doorway. sister clara lies dead on one of the children's beds. the blankets and sheets are soaked with blood. a bloody gash has been sliced up each of sister clara's arms. a blood stained straight razor sits on the bedside table. a crumpled piece of paper is clutched in one of sister clara's hands. carnby takes the paper and uncrumples it. the notes reads: "forgive me, edward."}

<D>__{then where the hell is everybody? where's everybody gone?}
<A>__{we look down at carnby and aline, alone in the intersection, empty streets all around them. we start to float up above them, getting a wider and wider bird's eye view of the city. we swoop up higher above them, but still, no one is visible anywhere in the city. we float up until the entire city stretches out below us. nothing moves. no one can be seen.}
<D>__{carnby (v.o.) (cont'd) here's what i know. there are two worlds on this planet. a world of light and a world of darkness. for millions of years, these worlds were in balance. but now, the lights of human civilization burn everywhere. the dark places are disappearing. we forced them to come out of the shadows. now, it's my job to force them back in. my name is edward carnby. i'm here to protect you from things you don't believe in.}
<A>__{we start to drop back down, faster and faster, the ground rushing towards us. we are descending directly above carnby and aline, standing alone in the empty intersection. we swoop down right in front of carnby. his trench coat blows in the wind. aline stands next to him, ready. carnby reloads his revolver.}
