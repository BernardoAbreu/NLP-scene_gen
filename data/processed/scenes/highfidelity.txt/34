<L>__{interior rob's apartment night}
<A>__{rob is surrounded by stacks of records on the floor. he looks to camera.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i'm reorganizing my records tonight. it's something i do in times of emotional distress. when laura was here i had them in alphabetical order, before that, chronologically. tonight, though, i'm trying to put them in the order in which i bought them. that way i can write my own autobiography without picking up a pen. pull them all off the shelves, look for revolver and go from there. i will be able to see how i got from deep purple to the soft boys in twenty five moves. what i really like about my new system is that it makes me more complicated than i am. to find anything you have to be me, or at the very least a doctor in rob ology. if you wanna find landslide by fleetwood mac you have to know that i bought it for someone in the fall of 1983 and then didn't give it to them for personal reasons. but you don't know any of that, do you? you would have to ask me to }
<A>__{the phone rings again. rob picks it up.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{hi, rob. it's your mother.}
<A>__{rob deflates a bit.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{hi, mom.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{everything all right?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{great. super fantastic.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{how's the store?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{so so. up and down.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{your lucky laura's doing so well. if it wasn't for her, i don't think either of us would ever sleep...}
<A>__{rob holds his lips together with thumb and forefinger, but succumbs }
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{she left. she's gone.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{what do you mean? where did she go?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{how would i know? gone. girlfriend. leave. not say where gone. laura move out.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{well call her mother.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{she just called. she doesn't even know. it's probably the last time i will ever hear her voice. that's weird, isn't it? you spend christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and... i dunno...}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{there'll be another mom and another christmas. right?}
<A>__{silence... more silence.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{hello? anybody there?}
<B>__{the sound of soft crying}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{you know that's not what's upsetting me.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{i knew this would happen. what are you going to do rob?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch tv and go to bed. then tomorrow i will get up and go to work.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{and after that?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{meet a nice girl and have children. i promise the next time we talk i will have it all sorted out.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{i knew this was going to happen.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{then what are you getting so upset about?}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{what did laura say? do you know why she left?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{it's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{so you say. i'd like to hear her side of it.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{mom! for the last fucking time, i'm telling you laura didn't want to get married! she is not that kind of girl! to use a phrase. that's not what happens now.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{well i don't know what happens now, apart from you meet someone, you move in, she goes. you meet someone, you move in, she goes.}
<A>__{silence. rob busted.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{shut up, mom.}
<A>__{rob hangs up the phone. he fills up his glass again, takes a swig, and slumps into a chair. if there was any wind left in rob, it just got knocked out. after a moment, he gets to his feet, grabs his jacket and heads out the door.}
