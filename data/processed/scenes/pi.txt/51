<A>__{max stirs cream into his coffee. then he pulls out the journal. a phone continues to ring. in the clouds of the lancet percy ad in the journal max writes down the two hundred and sixteen digit number. he studies it, examines it, draws on it, tries to figure out what it is.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{saturday? dark outside. there was a moment there...when, i don't know...when i didn't exist. what? what?}
<A>__{we hear a phone being picked up. the ringing stops. silence, then:}
<C>__{marcy dawson }
<D>__{max, is that you? max?}
<P>__{(pleading)}
<D>__{max, just talk to me. things are a bit out of hand down here. people are getting desperate.}
<P>__{(suddenly firm)}
<D>__{we had a deal, max. a deal. talk to us, max.}
<A>__{we hear the sound of a phone hanging up. at the coffee counter, max pops a handful of pills and crumples the paper.}
