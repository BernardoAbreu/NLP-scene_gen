<L>__{interior corner grocery store day}
<A>__{a pakistani counter clerk takes one look at the mob enter ing his store and bolts for the rear. a customer exits as nico herds his captives in.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{hands on the counter!}
<A>__{three men do it; the fourth is slow.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{don't tempt me, asshole }
<A>__{the fourth obeys. nico moves to the pay phone on the wall, covering the men with his .45. he grabs the re ceiver in his free hand; tries to dial. adrenaline makes his hand shake; the dials spin wrong one of the men sees nico's dilemma. to hit 911, nico has to take his eye momentarily off his captives. as nico turns again to the dial a free standing sales display hurtles toward him, crashing into his gun hand. one of the men has lunged into the display; now he dives atop nico a second later. the whole human pile crashes, thundering into a glass freezer. somehow nico gets to his feet. one of the men grabs nico's gun; nico swings one of the freezer doors wham! smack into the man's face. the glass shatters; the man drops like a rock. now it's three against one prime odds for nico. he wades into his attackers. a coffee stand goes flying. a body sails into a makeup display. one fool is lucky enough to land a blow that bloodies nico's nose; he pays with a shattered forearm and a head first heave into an ice cream locker }
<B>__{pov from outside store}
<A>__{it looks like a tornado has hit the interior. magazine racks crash, mayo jars fly through the air, the ice machine seems to explode as a man's back careens into it }
<B>__{street corner up block}
<A>__{two police cars heave into view, sirens wailing }
<B>__{front doors of store}
<A>__{nico takes the last man, lifts him up, and drives him like a battering ram straight through the glass.}
<B>__{nico}
<A>__{wild eyed and bloody, sees the cop cars whipping into the corner. he spins to see his .on the floor too far away to race for. he bolts down a gangway.}
