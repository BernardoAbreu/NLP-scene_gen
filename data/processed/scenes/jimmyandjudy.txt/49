<A>__{judy is looking at the lens of the camera. she's shaking and screaming.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{what is the matter with you jimmy? you almost got us caught. you're so worried about that camera. what is it? what is it!}
<A>__{jimmy calmly and quietly explains.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{twenty years from now, when we're together watching these tapes you'll realize how special this moment is. i owe it to you. and i owe it to us to capture everything and anything we do together.}
<A>__{judy is calmed but still is pissed.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{well you freak me out sometimes. why do you have to tape everything? it's like you have a problem or something.}
<A>__{judy's case isn't sticking. she treads lightly.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{you know, most of the reason kids think you're so weird is because of it. why do you think everybody makes fun of you? and then i have to hear it and i have to deal with it.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{so everybody makes fun of me, huh?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{yeah. can't you give the thing a fucking rest?}
<A>__{jimmy's fuming.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{and you don't want to deal with it? well fuck them and fuck you too if you think that. i couldn't give a fuck what people say. this is my life and i want to document it. and right now me filming you happens to be the only reason i manage to get out of my fucking bed every morning! you can't take this away from me!}
<A>__{jimmy starts crying. judy takes the camera. she tapes jimmy who is sobbing. now she is the one who speaks gently. she's trying to give him a taste of his own medicine.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{how does it feel jimmy? how does it feel to have someone taping you while you're crying?}
<A>__{jimmy doesn't answer. he tries to compose himself enough to speak. judy pushes harder.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{tell me. look at the camera and tell me how it feels!}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{you're not getting it. it doesn't matter how it feels right now.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{what matters is that you're seeing what's inside of me and your taping it. can you understand that?}
<A>__{judy doesn't know how to respond.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{can you?}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{well can you at least try?}
<A>__{jimmy is still crying. this weighs on her.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{yes. i can most definitely try.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{and you can never, ever, ever ask me to not film you or anything we do. that's the only thing i will ever ask of you. agreed?}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{okay. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{will you swear to it? on camera, will you swear to it?}
