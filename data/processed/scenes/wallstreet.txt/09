<A>__{the clock... it's 2.30 p.m. we hear the relentless clatter of the board ticker, and the drone of disembodied voices, blarihg market information out of squawk boxes. bud's desk is now cluttered with order tickets, literature, crumpled notes, beverage cups and a half eaten sandwich. he's on the phone and from the look on his face, the caller on the other end is breaking his balls. marvin paces past, making a dramatic phone pitch.}
<C>__{marv}
<D>__{dr. beltzer has to have his information this minute! it concerns his future!}

<D>__{fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i don't think you're being fair, sir. you assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{somebody has to pay for that error. and it's not me.}
