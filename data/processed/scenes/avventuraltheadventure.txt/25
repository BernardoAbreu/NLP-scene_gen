<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{in the rear of a general store, on the outskirts of a small sicilian town, a woman is seated at the window. she is very young, thin and irascible. up front, her husband is speaking with sandro, and as she listens attentively to what he is saying, a sarcastic smile spreads over her face.}
<C>__{husband}
<D>__{be patient, i can't remember everything.}
<C>__{sandro}
<P>__{(indicating the newspaper article)}
<D>__{but it even says what she bought: a bar of soap! so there's no point in making believe you can't remember.}
<A>__{after waiting a few seconds to give her husband a chance to explain himself, the wife jumps up from where she is sitting, comes over to sandro and yanks the paper from his hands. then she starts reading the article in a jerky manner typical of one who is not too literate.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{"a young female stranger, whose description corresponds with that of the missing girl, came into my store..."}
<A>__{she suddenly stops reading and turns toward sandro.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{she came and then she left. with him. but this one won't admit it.}
<P>__{(turning upon her husband furiously)}
<D>__{you think i wasn't aware of it...}
<A>__{the husband, a young man, tries to keep calm and carry on the conversation in a logical, persuasive manner.}
<C>__{husband}
<D>__{but if i was carrying on with the girl, why would i want to give any of this information to the newspaper?}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{that's what i'd like to know myself.}
<C>__{husband}
<D>__{fine, that makes two of us who want to know. in fact, three, with him.}
<A>__{he indicates sandro. then, seeing a fat, luscious female customer enter the store, he turns to her and continues:}
<C>__{husband}
<D>__{ah, lady amalia, would you be interested in knowing why i told the newspapers about a certain girl who came here the other day and then disappeared?}
<A>__{the woman, anxious to learn about any new bit of gossip, becomes immediately interested.}
<C>__{lady amalia}
<D>__{disappeared? who is she? ... where? when?}
<C>__{husband}
<D>__{and that makes four. anybody else?...}
<A>__{sandro, a little sick and tired of the whole matter, and wanting to put an end to what has by now become farcical, intervenes.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{you have to be precise. did this girl enter your store or didn't she?}
<C>__{wife}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{sandro}
<P>__{(ignoring her)}
<D>__{was she blonde or brunette?}
<C>__{husband}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{brunette.}
<C>__{wife}
<P>__{(contradicting him)}
<D>__{blonde.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{how was she dressed?}
<C>__{husband}
<D>__{i don't quite remember. seems to me she wore a black dress.}
<C>__{wife}
<P>__{(intervening sarcastically)}
<D>__{he doesn't look at dresses, he looks at what's under them.}
<A>__{the husband turns around and looks at his wife menacingly.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{pardon me, but has anyone else been here asking about this girl?}
<C>__{husband}
<D>__{no ... i don't think so.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{thanks.}
