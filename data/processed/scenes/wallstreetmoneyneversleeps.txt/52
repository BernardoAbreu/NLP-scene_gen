<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{fuck no.}
<A>__{jacob now finds himself looking at a political cartoon from the early 1900s. it's of two men rowing a boat in a lake of dollars. one of the men is uncle sam dressed in us flag colors. but sam's very small in this cartoon... can't really row the boat. the other man is much bigger and clearly doing the heavy rowing. he is...}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{jp morgan... he single handedly stopped the panic of 1907 by stepping in and buying up shares in all the companies that were crashing. everyone else quickly followed like lemmings.}
<P>__{(re political cartoon)}

<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{see jacob... the best opportunities are found where angels fear to tread.}
<A>__{and they arrive at the next piece on the wall... a small framed bond.}

<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{weimer republic of germany 1922. inflation turned to hyper inflation and it was more efficient to burn the money for heat than spend it.}

<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{as they both hold on the picture...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what caused it?}
<C>__{gordon gekko}

<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{... sound familiar?}
<C>__{jacob}

<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{if we don't take our heads out of the sand... yes. it's going to get bad out there, champ, i'm not going to lie. even the small regional bank i started out at might go under.}

<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{what i'm talking about, jake... is that i'd bet dollars to donuts that bretton woods unwound most of his position in amlyn last week. that he knew about the pancreatitis.}
<A>__{off of jacob's confusion...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{the only reason you think you hurt him is because he wanted you to think that.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{how do you know that?}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{i don't. but it's not bretton's first rodeo... and my instincts for this sort of thing don't often disappointerior}
<A>__{jacob can't believe it. and with each passing moment of realization... shock turns into rage.}
<C>__{jacob}
