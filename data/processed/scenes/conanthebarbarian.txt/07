<T>__{cut to: training montage:}
<A>__{conan is tested under corin's watchful eye: forced to sleep in the snow, while his father keeps warm inside. a heavy boulder on his shoulder blades while he balances on wet river rocks. climbing a cliff face, his bare hands leaving blood behind on the jagged rocks.}
<L>__{interior cimmerian forge day}
<A>__{flames reflect in the blue eyes of conan as he works the bellows of the forge. sparks buzz like angry fireflies as he stokes the blaze. corin sharpens a sword, perfecting it. conan cannot take his eyes off it, stepping away from the bellows.}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{stoke your fire, boy.}
<A>__{conan slams the bellows closed, anger rising.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{"stoke your fire, chop your wood." i have slept where wolves dare not. i have balanced a thousand river stones. when will you teach me the sword?}
<A>__{corin stares his son in the eyes. judging.}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{think you're ready? then tell me: what is a sword's purpose?}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{to slay ones enemies.}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{no. that is what it does. its purpose is why you use it.}
<A>__{he tosses conan two lumps of ore.}
<C>__{corin }
<D>__{tell me, which makes the best sword?}
<A>__{conan takes the two lumps, testing them. he hands his father back one.}
<C>__{corin }
<D>__{the stronger ore, eh? then we shall make a sword of it, and tomorrow you will show me what brute strength yields.}
