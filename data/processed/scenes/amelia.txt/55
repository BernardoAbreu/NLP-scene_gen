<L>__{exterior garden, rye day}
<A>__{close on amelia as she kneels, carefully putting new plants into the ground. we see patience, concentration. contentment. after a moment...}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{i’m surprised you’re all right with this...}
<A>__{widen angle. george kneeling beside her. happily planting his own.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{mmm hmmn. i was braced for the lecture. five years since lindbergh, no one's made it solo, so many of them died.}
<A>__{he looks at her work. reaches over. starts packing the earth harder around her plant. she just watches, then...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well, they were only men. this is different.}
<A>__{she reaches to his plant and starts loosening the soil...}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{i was waiting to hear that i'm only doing this because i was just a passenger last time, and i'd rather die than go on living as a fraud..}
<A>__{no one cracks a smile. it's like laurel and hardy in a food fight where each lets the other take his best shot. george reaches now, starts repacking her soil...}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{but you don’t think that, do you, dear?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{of course not. but if i did...}
<A>__{she smacks his hand. he just keeps working. she finally grins, smacks him harder. he doesn't seem to notice.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{...all the more reason to say yes.}
