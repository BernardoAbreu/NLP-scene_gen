<A>__{a lengthy pov shot from travis' vantage point behind the wheel. we see the city as travis sees it. the front windshield is a little dirty, the lighted meter just up at the low right screen. the intercom crackles with static and messages. the light turns green; we take off with a start. a short first gear quick shift a long second gear. the cab eases to the right of the street, checking out prospective fares. our eyes scan the long lines of pedestrians. the regular bums, junkies, tourists, hookers, homosexuals, hippies they mean nothing now. they only blend into the sidewalks and lighted storefronts. our eyes now concentrate on those that step away from the curb is that man hailing a cab or scratching his head? in the next block there are perhaps three, four fares quick gas up through this yellow light brake sharply check the action. the first: tourist, nickel tipper let the next guy pick them up. let the second go also, the third there's a live fare. middle aged local woman: short fare to the east side, good tip. we pull to the curb, waiting for her to get in. it is a long wait a black street walker crosses in front of the cab. we focus on (as travis would) a young couple embracing in the distance. as we travel, we hear travis' random thoughts about selecting fares and tips:}

<D>__{you work at night, you get an instinct. you can smell them. the big tippers, the stiffs, the trouble makers. quarter is good tip for manhattan. queens is better, brooklyn is best. go for the guys with suitcases. the rich are the worst tippers, hooks are lousy. spooks are okay, but they don't live at park ave after all.}
<A>__{the meter is activated: $.60 registers. tick, tick, tick. a quick glance shows the woman is now seated. she says softly, "192 east 89". we take off with another jolt. cross back up}
