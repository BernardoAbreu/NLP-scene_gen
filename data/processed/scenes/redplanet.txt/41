<L>__{interior ares mev deck day}
<A>__{gallagher comes in too fast. stumbles up. it's just confusing. he resets. opens up a locker, about three feet by three feet. he calls in to what seems to be a large tangle of silver pipes.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{good morning, amee. step out carefully, we're in multi directional gravity.}
<A>__{amee, the autonomous mapping exploration and evasion unit, unfolds and steps gingerly from the cabinet. about waist high, eight legs, stereo camera eyes. like a big silver spider. old attachments have been sawed off and buffed down. she's a piece of off the shelf gear that's been modified. when the light hits her at the right angle, we can see a marine corps insignia still etched under the refinishing.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<P>__{how are we after launch? i'd like to run a systems check. (as she nods)}
<D>__{shall we do the hokey pokey? just to satisfy me?}
<A>__{she rapidly shakes each of her legs in turn. gallagher flips on a wrist panel display. built into the fabric of his suit. he sees what amee sees.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{take a look around.}
<A>__{he flips off the lights. she flicks over to ir, sees just fine in the dark. turns the lights back on.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{and how is your c.p.u. today?}
<A>__{a 1000 quick calculations flash by and then "good."}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{okay, run the occasional self test. let me know if anything's wrong. and back to storage.}
<A>__{amee contracts and climbs back into her locker. gallagher shuts the door. display reads "good bye" and winks out.}
