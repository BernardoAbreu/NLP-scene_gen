<L>__{interior turpin's mansion library day}
<A>__{judge turpin leads anthony into the dark library, filled with books. anthony is looking around for johanna. he is wary, this is all very strange.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{... you were looking for hyde park, you say?}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{yes, it's terribly large on the map but i keep getting lost...}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{sit down, lad, sit down.}
<A>__{anthony sits, uncomfortable, as the judge pours two snifters of brandy.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{it's embarrassing for a sailor to lose his bearings, but, well, there you are.}
<A>__{then... the large form of the beadle appears from the shadows. no introduction is made. anthony glances to him, uneasy.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{a sailor, eh?}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{yes, sir. the "bountiful" out of plymouth.}
<C>__{judge}
<P>__{(handing him a snifter of brandy)}
<D>__{a sailor must know the ways of the world, yes? ... must be practiced in the ways of the world ... would you say you are practiced, boy?}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{sir?}
<A>__{the judge moves to consider some beautiful volumes, bound in the richest leather. he runs a finger along the spines of the books; his large library of pornography.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{oh, yes ... such practices ... the geishas of japan ... the concubines of siam .. the catamites of greece ... the harlots of india ... i have them all here ... drawings of them ....}
<C>__{judge }
<P>__{(he turns again to anthony)}
<D>__{... all the vile things you've done with your whores.}
<A>__{anthony is speechless. the judge just smiles at him amiably.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{would you like to see?}
<C>__{anthony}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{i think there's been some mistake }
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{oh, i think not. you gandered at my ward, johanna ... you gandered at her ... yes, sir, you gandered.}
<A>__{the beadle moves behind anthony.}
<C>__{anthony}
<P>__{(glancing nervously back at the beadle)}
<D>__{i meant no harm }
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{your meaning is immaterial. mark me: if i see your face again on this street, you'll rue the day your bitch of a mother gave you birth.}
<A>__{anthony is stunned. the judge proceeds with shocking venom:}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{my johanna isn't one of your bloody cock chafers! my johanna is not to be gandered at!}
<A>__{he nods to the beadle the beadle instantly grabs anthony and brutally hauls him out.}
