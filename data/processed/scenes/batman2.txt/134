<A>__{the birds in the shaft have all roosted on the top of the car. they're patiently riding it down as it descends...}

<A>__{the car stops again. provost is totally losing it. the exasperated guard grabs him and shakes him.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{okay, mr. provost i'm gonna have a look through the trap door. but i need you to help me. okay? you have to help.}
<A>__{provost nods and tries to get a grip on himself. the guard looks up at the trap door in the ceiling of the car. he can't reach it... he uncuffs the box containing provost's raven from his wrist and stands on it. still short. unholstering his gun and using it as a prod, he can almost reach the trap door. he jumps up and, poking with the gun, manages to dislodge the panel slightly. more twittering. provost and the guard look up through the tiny crack in the ceiling and see nothing but darkness.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{probably just some bird that's gotten in the shaft. now calm down. you'll have to give me a boost.}
<A>__{the guard climbs back atop the raven box. provost gives him a boost and he manages to catch hold of the lip of the trap door.}
<C>__{guard }
<D>__{okay, help me out...steady...}
<A>__{provost wraps both arms around the guard's wriggling legs and tries to hoist him upward.}
