<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior loch ness early evening}
<A>__{the sun has just gone down behind the hills, but there is still light in the sky. an ominous mist is beginning to settle on the water. gabrielle is sitting in the stern of a rowboat, her parasol in her lap. she is wearing holmes' norfolk jacket over her dress to ward off the chill. on the rowing seat, facing her, are watson and holmes, the latter in his waistcoat. their oars are pulled in, and they are watching urquhart castle, on the opposite side of the lake.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{we have now observed the castle from the front, from the back, from the side, from land, from water... what now? are you planning to spend the night out here?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{if necessary.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you're going to catch your death of cold.}
<P>__{(to gabrielle)}
<D>__{wouldn't it be ironic if holmes' last case were a case of pneumonia?}
<P>__{(with an embarrassed chuckle)}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{gabrielle glances past them, and her eyes widen.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<P>__{(pointing off)}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{holmes and watson turn their heads. about half a mile away, moving in and out of patches of drifting mist, is watson's monster, its long reptillian neck cutting through the water. watson leaps to his feet.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{holmes!}
<A>__{holmes grabs his arm, pulls him back into his seat.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{quick, watson. after it!}
<A>__{he grabs his oar, and watson belatedly joins in. they strain at the oars, setting a course which will intercept the monster. gabrielle leans forward in her seat, trying to peer past them through the curtains of mist. the monster is much closer now no more than a quarter of a mile away. suddenly watson stops rowing.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{holmes, what are we doing? we should be going away from it.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{keep rowing, dammit!}
<A>__{watson resumes pulling on his oar. as they row, holmes looks over his shoulder. the monster has started to submerge. its head disappears beneath the surface of the water, and the wake it leaves behind soon trails off into the mist. holmes ships his oar.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{we've lost it.}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(stops rowing)}
<D>__{at least you admit there's an it, not just a figment of my imagination.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{quiet.}
<A>__{he listens intently. there is only the sound of water slapping against the side of the boat. the mist is heavier now, and billowing around them.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(to watson)}
<D>__{do you have your stethoscope with you?}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{never without it.}
<A>__{he removes his bowler, unwinds the stethoscope from the inside the crown, hands it to holmes. holmes plugs in the ear pieces, leans over the side of the boat, extends the other end of the stethoscope to the surface of the water.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i can hear something...}
<A>__{we become aware of the faint beating of engines, accompanied by a bubbling sound.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it's getting closer closer }
<A>__{suddenly the surface of the water breaks, about twenty yards away from them, and the head and neck of the monster rear up from the depths. watson is first to notice it and jumps to his feet, making choking noises. gabrielle sees it and screams. watson grabs an oar, throws it at the monster as it comes past. the backwash hits the boat broadside, rocking it, and holmes, watson and gabrielle are spilled into the lake. the monster moves away from them, heading in the general direction of the castle. it disappears into the mist. holmes is the first to come up, looks around, sees gabrielle surfacing a few yards away, swims to her.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{are you all right?}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{i lost my parasol.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{where's watson?}
<A>__{he glances around, sees watson's bowler floating nearby, swims over to it.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{watson?}
<A>__{he lifts the hat but watson isn't under it. as gabrielle hoists herself into the boat, watson clambers over the other side. after a moment holmes joins them, and they sit there, sopping wet and breathing heavily.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{i have come face to face with man eating tigers i was once caught in a stampede of wild elephants india, you know but i wasn't half as frightened. this beast seems to have a personal grudge against us.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{i just hope it doesn't come back.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i don't think it will.}
<P>__{(pointing off)}
<D>__{look!}
<A>__{they glance in the indicated direction. there is no sign of the monster. but the mist has momentarily lifted to reveal the castle, and an odd sight greets their eyes the wooden scaffolding in front of the tower is slowly rising into the air.}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{what strange goings on.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{not really. my guess is that the monster, after a hard day's work, has returned home for his supper.}
<A>__{the scaffolding in front of the tower slowly descends back into the place, as mist once more engulfs the castle.}
