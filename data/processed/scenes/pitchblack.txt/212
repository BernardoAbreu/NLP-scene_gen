<L>__{exterior settlement night}
<A>__{riddick's pov: ahead of us, we see fry, imam, and audrey vanishing around the corner. breathing like a racehorse, we follow in their steps, storming around the same corner. suddenly a predator is right there , right in our face. predator's pov: of riddick skidding to a stop. he snaps a look up. riddick's pov: of another predator perched gargoyle like on the building. it speed clicks at us. predator's pov: of riddick slowly pulling two shivs. bracing himself. ready to blade it out.}
