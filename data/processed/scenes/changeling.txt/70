<C>__{dr. tarr}
<D>__{ and it's clear that he has something to tell. i'm sure that in time he will give his boyish story of the entire affair, but not until he has faith in his listener. and that is what is lacking: faith in the poor lad's story. in the course of my examination, i found nothing to dispute the findings by the lapd.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{how come he hasn't been able to tell anyone what happened while he was gone?}
<C>__{dr. tarr}
<D>__{i would say that the boy has either been coached or questioned to a point where he is largely confused about what happened to him during}

<C>__{dr. tarr }
<D>__{those many months. it's possible that his mental lapse may be the result of a blow to the head or a sudden shock which brought about a possible cranial injury. i believe that this condition will pass soon. until then, i recommend that the police department continue working with him, exposing him to whatever elements of his previous life as may help restore his memory.}

<C>__{rev. briegleb}
<D>__{i was not laughing at your situation, mrs. collins. it's just...after one has this sort of conversation enough times, a certain degree of hysteria begins to set in. please, sit.}
<A>__{reluctantly, she does. shakes her head in disbelief.}

<C>__{rev. briegleb}
<D>__{you have no idea how many people have sat in that very chair and said those exact same words to me in relation to our friends at the los angeles police department.}
