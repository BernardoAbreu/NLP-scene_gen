<A>__{leia walks between han and lando as chewie follows a short distance behind. long shafts of light pour across the corridor between tall, pure white columns.}
<C>__{lando}
<D>__{so you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the... uh... jurisdiction of the empire.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{so you're part of the mining guild then?}
<C>__{lando}
<D>__{no, not actually. our operation is small enough not to be noticed... which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.}
<A>__{the group walks into another corridor and heads for a huge doorway at the far end.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{aren't you afraid the empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down?}
<C>__{lando}
<D>__{that's always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we've built here. but things have developed that will insure security. i've just made a deal that will keep the empire out of here forever.}
