<A>__{early afternoon. a rainy spring day. students run to the university doors, protecting themselves with textbooks.}
<L>__{interior indiana jones' office}
<A>__{rain splatters the window of this cramped, cluttered room. crooked stacks of dog eared textbooks and papers nearly reach the ceiling. the spindly bookshelves are stuffed with various archeological relics and instruments: animal and bird skeletons, fossils, primitive statues, etc. sitting at a small wooden desk, amidst a mountain of term papers, is indiana jones. indy is wearing a brown three piece suit and circular, wire rimmed glasses. in one hand, he holds a student seat assignment card, as he hurriedly reads through the term papers. he furiously grades each paper. to make matters worse; the office is crowded with students, with countless others pouring out into the hallway. all of the students are anxious to get inside. they are badgering, complaining and moaning at indy.}

<A>__{indiana continues to grade the papers, trying to ignore the verbal assault. betsy tuffet pushes her way to the front. betsy is indy's student assistant. she is 21 years old, with thick, luxurious black hair, bright brown eyes and a small framed, athletic body. betsy is a tough. brash. a brooklyn kid. she moves close to indy, her hair brushing his cheek. indiana is very tense, continuously working on the term papers.}

<D>__{special delivery! dr. indiana jones!}
<A>__{a burly postman stands in the doorway, holding a thick, enormous brown envelope. indy motions to the postman. the postman tries to make his way through the crowd. indiana goes back to his grading, but is suddenly interrupted by a loud tapping noise. he looks up. dean claude coventry, a stately, elderly gentleman, raps a steel ruler on indiana's desk. the dean is upset. very serious.}
<C>__{dean coventry}
<D>__{doctor jones, i've had complaints from several of the students }

<D>__{me?... distracted?...}
<C>__{postman}
<P>__{(staring at indy's signature, puzzled)}
<D>__{what's this? "b+"? that's how you sign your name?}
<A>__{indy grabs the paper. he's signed a "b+" on the line where his name is supposed to appear. indy crosses out the grade and signs his name. professor coventry still lectures indiana.}
<C>__{dean coventry}
<D>__{marshall university is not the place for sloppy behavior...}
<A>__{at that moment, indy opens the envelope! a large amount of water pours out! saturating the papers on the desk! this is followed by an enormous dead trout! it flops onto indy's desk. the students exchange startled and nauseous glances. indiana removes a water logged note from the envelope. it reads, "a macgowan's word is truer than an angel's kiss". indiana uses a tissue to wipe some of the water from his desk. dean coventry shakes a finger at indy.}
<C>__{dean coventry}
<D>__{i have one final warning for you, doctor jones }
<A>__{the phone rings! interrupting the dean! indiana quickly answers the phone. a fuming dean coventry impatiently waits to finish his threat. indiana speaks into the receiver.}

<A>__{indiana hangs up. he gives an embarassed look to the furious, red faced dean.}
<C>__{dean coventry}
<D>__{you are on probation, jones! ten days! if there is no improvement, you will be dismissed!}
