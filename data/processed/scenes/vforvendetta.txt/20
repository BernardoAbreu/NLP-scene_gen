<L>__{exterior rooftops}
<A>__{police cars and several ambulances swarm over the area with the dead fingermen. v watches them from above.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{why did you do that? why did you... help me?}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{why indeed?}
<A>__{he takes out an old antique pocket watch. it is almost midnight.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{almost time.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{for the music.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{music?}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{yes, music. my music. you see. evey, i am a performer.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{is that why you're wearing a mask?}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{we all wear masks. life creates them and forces us to find the one that fits. do you know what day it is?}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{uh... november fourth.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{not for long.}
<A>__{he looks out where, rising above the rooftops, he can see big ben.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{"remember, remember, the fifth of november, the gunpowder treason and plot. i know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot."}
<A>__{the second hand sweeps into the final minute.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{tell me, evey, what good is an actor that plays his part to an empty theatre?}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{nor do i. that's why you are here. i need you, evey. i need someone to listen.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{to your music?}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{yes. yes, to my music.}
<A>__{from his sleeve, he pulls a conductor's wand.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{can you hear it? it's already begun.}
<A>__{he begins to lightly tap the wand in the air and, very faintly, we hear it.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{i can't hear anything.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{at first, you have to listen very carefully...}
<A>__{he continues to conduct and we begin to hear the music, violins and horns that seem almost like a whisper or a wind that steadily swells.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{ahh, yes. there it is. beautiful, is it not?}
<A>__{he turns to the parapet, his gestures growing grander as the music rises and we recognize tchaikovsky's 1812 overture. the music mounts a climax and v points the wand at big ben as cymbals crash big ben explodes with such force the world seems to shake, while v, smiling, always smiling, points again with another crescendo and the statue of justice is blown to smithereens. v nods in appreciation while mustering the music towards it's finale as fireworks begin lighting up the sky.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{oh my...}
<A>__{everywhere across the city, people stand transfixed by the dazzling shimmer of the fireworks until a strobing final blitz leaves a single, starry image floating in the smoke filled sky. it is the letter v.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{it's beautiful...}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{from every direction, the city screams with the panicked sound of sirens.}
