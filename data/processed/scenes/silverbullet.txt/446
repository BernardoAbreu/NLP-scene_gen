<A>__{a.) uncle al pulls up to a city store front with a sign reading mac's guns and ammo. he takes out the st. cristopher's medal, looks at it, and shakes his head, as if still ruing his own credulity and stupidity. he goes inside.}
<P>__{jane (voice over)}
<D>__{uncle al's friend mac was more than a gunsmith; he was, uncle al said, an old world craftsman, a sort of wizard of weapons.}
<A>__{b.) in the gun shop interior, we see uncle al talking to mac, who really should look like an elderly white wizard a kind of gandalf figure. in the b.g. window we see a paper skeleton and paper jack o' lanterns: our first clue that all hallow's eve is nearing. uncle al is speaking animatedly, using his hands a lot; we don't know exactly what the tale is, but it must be a whopper. in the course of it, he hands the medal and the crucifix to mac, who tents the silver chains over his fingers and looks at them.}
<P>__{jane (v o continues)}
<D>__{god knows what sort of story my uncle told him, but i think that for men who have been married as often as uncle al, invention on short notice becomes something of a specialty.}
<A>__{c.) in his workroom, we see mac spilling boron over the medal and looking closely at the stain.}
<P>__{jane (v o continues)}
<D>__{the gunsmith confirmed the high grade silver content of my crucifix and marty's medallion...}
<A>__{d.) in a dim shot which makes mac look more like a sorcerer than ever, we see him light an acetylene torch and begin melting the medal and the crucifix in the crucible. the camera moves slowly in as jane's contribution and marty's melt together; they are becoming on and indissoluble.}
<P>__{jane (v o continues)}
<D>__{...melted them down...}
<A>__{e.) we see mac pouring molten silver into a bullet mold.}
<P>__{jane (v o concludes)}
<D>__{...and molded them into a silver bullet.}
