<L>__{exterior pentagon day}
<A>__{flying over washington d. c. , we cross the potomac and circle the five cornered building, looking particularly gloomy on this grey day.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{six years ago, this committee commissioned me with a very specific task...}
<L>__{interior pentagon conference room day}
<A>__{at the table are six men. a handful of senior military brass and top civilian advisors direct their attention to the front of the room, where sebastian, flanked by matt and linda, is in the middle of his presentation.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{to successful phase shift a human being out of quantum sync with the visible universe and then return him safely, with no after affects.}
<A>__{next to sebastian a video shows a small monkey shifting from the visible spectrum. it's hair, skin, organs and skeletons slowly dissolve before our eyes.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{well, we found out sending them to "never never land" was easy, it's the getting back that's hard.}
<A>__{sebastian fast forwards a few moments until the video screen shows the bizarrely tangled heap of flesh and bone that used to be alive.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{every time we've tried to bring a test subject back from phase shift. cellular bonds would dissolve, the primary dna strands would decay. but now...}
<A>__{sebastian pauses. something's bothering him.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{but now...}
<A>__{one of the senior advisers, dr. harry kramer, distinguished 50s, finally breaks the silence.}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{but now?}
<A>__{linda and matt look up at sebastian expectantly.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{but now...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{but now, we feel we are closer than ever to resolving this issue. we've been experimenting with a new regression formula that looks rather promising. a four star general leans forward.}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{how long?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{son, as you can imagine, we are very anxious to field test this tactical asset. how long till you resolve this issue?}
<A>__{linda starts to speak, but sebastian cuts her off with a look.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{shouldn't be more than another year, sir.}
<A>__{frustrated sighs all around the room.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{maybe sooner.}
