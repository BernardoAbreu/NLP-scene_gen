<L>__{interior hallway outside locked room day}
<A>__{nell and theo walk down the long hallway behind, opening doors, checking rooms.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{david?}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{maybe he never came in. if he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right? or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell. maybe he's outside.}
<A>__{nell closes a door on the right, and then stops dead. staring. the shut, dark, door, the one that scared nell and theo earlier, awaits them at the end. ominous. nell approaches. closer and closer. the door nears. nell wraps her arms tightly about herself and try's to open the door. it's locked. her breath fogs the air. she doesn't notice it. but then she suddenly gags. with a look of horror she recoils from the door, choking, covering her face. then theo smells it. the women are both sick from the smell.}
<C>__{theo }
<D>__{oh my god, what is it? oh, the smell... ohhh.}
<A>__{marrow comes into the hallway. he sees them from a distance. on the two women.}
<C>__{theo}
<P>__{(looks to nell for an answer)}
<D>__{is it over?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{no, it's getting worse.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{nell! what's wrong?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{that smell... oh, god.}
<A>__{theo blanches, looks at nell. she smells it too, and in mirror image fashion backs away from the doors also. marrow notices the exchange, and watches them, intense. and then, in a heartbeat, the moment is over.}
