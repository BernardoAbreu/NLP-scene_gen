<D>__{look, you'll see...}
<A>__{ben pulls his magnum out of his belt and points the gun at one of the mirrors he has dragged outside. amy steps back, terrified }
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what are you doing with that gun... put it down, ben... put it down right now!}
<A>__{without a moment's hesitation, ben opens fire. the mirror shatters to pieces }
<C>__{amy }
<D>__{are you crazy ben? have you gone completely mad?}
<A>__{ben smiles, all excited }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{wait, look, you'll see...}
<A>__{through the front window, daisy and michael witness the scene }
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{see what, ben?! what am i supposed to see ?!}
<A>__{ben keeps a piercing gaze as the bullet impacts the mirror, waiting for the magic to do its trick and for the cracks to dissolve again but nothing happens. the cracks remain, in a spider web pattern. behind the front door, ben notices michael, watching him, in tears. without any evidence, ben is in over his head.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{but... i swear to you i... i saw...amy...}
<A>__{the neighbors, alerted by the blast of the gun, come out of their houses to find out what has happened. ben stands alone, looking like a mad man... amy holds back her tears and tries to stay in control }
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{get out...now! i don't ever want to see you here again, ben. and i will have the lawyers make sure the same goes for the kids. you are insane, ben, and dangerous... you've got to get help.}
<A>__{with gun in hand, ben walks away, dismayed, as he gradually becomes aware of the situation he has just created. he enters his car and drives off at top speed.}
