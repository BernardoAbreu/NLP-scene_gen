<A>__{john letour, forty, light sleeper. never meant to be a drug dealer, it just came along. he's been other things: messenger boy, cab driver, model, postal clerk, doorman, nightclub shill never meant to be them either. now he's a d.d. drug dealer. john letour, well groomed, khaki slacks, leather jacket, tippet like scarf, belt pouch, "beatle" boots, a shadow drifting in and out of other shadows, new york, day, night: watching, listening, rarely speaking nonexistent, seen only by those he sees. his face an affable blank. make of it what you will. the eyes flicker; the hands shift discreetly. a map of calculation. once he had a drug problem. life turned a page. today he follows instructions: he sleeps light one eye open, anticipating. john letour, d.d., loner, voyeur, has been drifting toward an unknown destination. at mid life the destination draws near. the circle tightens. the dealer is anxious. the destination is love.}
<B>__{night in the life}
<A>__{credit sequence: new york by night. john letour nestles in back of a blue car service sedan, face reflected in the window. neon mixes with steam, street people with tourists, young dates: each with a different agenda, a hidden purpose. his beeper goes off. he clicks it, checks the digital message. the driver stops at an uptown corner. letour opens the curbside door, motions to the driver he'll be back in "ten" minutes. he enters the video laundromat, a twenty four hour video rental laundromat tanning salon. inside, he meets a retro yuppie (j. crew division) in the "classics" section. they exit. on the sidewalk, money is exchanged for a packet. letour pockets the uncounted cash. the yuppie mouths goodbye, eager to put distance between him and letour. john checks his beeper, stops at a pay phone, dials. john letour re enters the sedan; the driver heads downtown. high rises give way to tudor city. uncollected trash lines the curbs. letour eyes a pedestrian; pedestrian looks back. later. three a.m. the streets are dark. letour's car passes a glowing korean market. letour narrates from diary:}

<D>__{labor day weekend. some time for a sanitation strike. everybody crazy to stock up. they decide to score at the last minute and want it now. never fails. the faces look alike. you gotta use memory tricks: each has some peculiarity it keeps you sharp. a d.d. told me when a drug dealer starts writing a diary it's time to quit. i started writing after that. not every night now and then. just to burn off the night. fill up one book, throw it out, start another.}

<A>__{four a.m.: streets empty. letour's sedan drops him off near a ten story west 80s apartment building. john gives the driver a forty dollar tip (standard procedure), turns the corner. he presses the intercom; a buzzer unlocks the door. he enters the lobby, walks past english reproduction furniture toward the elevators. presses the button. penthouse c door opens. ann lets john in with a smile. ann, forty four, striking in a tailored dress, greets him with a wet kiss. her hair is coiffured, her face made up. she is john's employer, mentor, confidante, mother hen: she keeps the books. her ingenuous demeanor belies sterner stuff: she's been in the drug business fifteen years. ann's apartment is a jumble of sensibilities: dark green walls, zebra skin sofa, haitian wall friezes, framed magazine photos of paramahansa yogananda, liz taylor, the duke of windsor paintings stacked behind an oversized urn. a bird flits in its cage. one corner of the living area is devoted to a fledgling cosmetics business: macintosh computer, billboard of trade paper clippings and ads, herbal samples, reference books, color charts. robert, fifty, slight, waves hello as john locks the door. gay, hip, worn, he's john's "co runner." they work and eat out of ann's apartment. take out tins of indian food are stacked amid crystals, tarot cards, glasses, and vitamin bottles. no sign of drugs, drug paraphernalia, or money.}

<D>__{oh. okay.}
<A>__{the sedan continues south. it turns, stops in front of john's chelsea apartment building. john hops out, goes in. inside john's apartment he a man possessed pulls his black tweed from the closet, throws it on the futon. he rolls up his shirt, reaches under the futon, removes the .38. he straps the gun to his back, wraps duct tape around his chest, end to end over the .38. he tucks in his shirt, puts on the jacket, checks the mirror to see if the gun shows: it doesn't. a pause to appreciate. letour closes his diary, throws it out the window: a trifle. he slaps cologne on his cheeks annointing; heads toward the door. outside, letour emerges, walks quickly to the car, plops beside ann. the sedan drives off. back seat:}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{that took long enough. what did you do, douche while you were at it?}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{ann, you got some mouth on you.}

<D>__{cologne?}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{for you.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{phew. it smells like that stuff they give you on airplanes. it's no good for your skin. all chemicals.}
<A>__{letour pulls out a slip of paper, writes a name and address: "linda wichel, 1012b 2 a street, sacramento, california."}

<A>__{she takes the name and address.}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(eye contact)}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{ann, sad, looks out the window. she touches his knee. the car pulls in front of the pennsylvania hotel, 34th and 7th.}

<D>__{i thought we were going to tis'?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{we are. he's here. he can't very well work out of his apartment after what happened yesterday, can he?}
<A>__{they get out.}
<T>__{cut to:}

<C>__{ann}
<D>__{twelve oh four.}
<A>__{they go to the elevators, wait with chatty card collectors [pete rose this, pete rose that]. twelfth floor. ann and john step out of the elevator, look for 1204. letour, a step behind, is all eyes, all ears. ann checks the number, rings the bell. thomas lets them in the standard issue suite, locks the door. letour was right: it's a set up. thomas and a teenage cuban stand either side of them, waistbands conspicuously bulging. no tis. john turns to ann:}
<C>__{letour}
<P>__{(jesus to judas)}
<D>__{ann.}
<A>__{ann's confused, then furious: she had no part in the "set up." in fact, she doesn't even know it's a set up. bursting rage, she turns on thomas, yells:}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i told you greasy fucks i don't deal with guns! i see guns, i walk! how dare you?}
<A>__{she slaps thomas, pulls the 9mm from his waistband, throws it to the carpet. the cuban watches bewildered, gun drawn, awaiting instructions. now ann's on him:}

<D>__{and you, beaner, whoever the fuck you are, kiss my fat ass!}
<P>__{(she spits on his}

<P>__{(to ann)}
<D>__{sorry about the guns. my fuck up. i was just trying to make a point i apologize.}

<D>__{we'll make the deal tomorrow same terms. ann. sorry. go on, leave, you're upset. i just need to talk to tour a second. about a police matter.}

<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(out of shot)}
<D>__{fire! fire! fire!}
<A>__{the fire bell rings. thomas, tis, and the cuban stare dumbfounded. letour reaches behind his shirt in the confusion, yanks out the .38 with a painful rip, turning, fires point blank into the cuban's chest. blam! shirt fabric flares, flies: the cuban falls with blank expression. thomas, off guard, wheels and fires wildly at letour. john fires back. both are hit. tis ducks into the bedroom. thomas and letour fire again, again hitting, missing. a bullet hits its mark: thomas, frozen, grabs his blood spurting throat, slumps to floor. letour bleeds from the stomach and shoulder. his shirt soaks red; he struggles to stand. cuban and thomas both dead. letour checks the .38: five rounds fired one left. letour staggers into the bedroom, finds tis frantically searching an open suitcase. off screen voices under the fire bell.}
<C>__{tis}
<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{i didn't }
<A>__{letour steps to tis, aims, shoots him barrel to forehead. exit debris hits the wall. he is dead. off screen screams of guests are countered by commands from hotel security: "get down!" "get back!" fire horns and sirens reverb from the street. letour, losing consciousness, sits bedside. gun slips from his hand. deflating, he drifts back first to the bedspread. blood spreads. his eyes are open. police voices approach.}
<T>__{fade out:}
<B>__{every grain of sand}
<A>__{prison waiting area. ann, wearing a wool suit, waits among black hispanic friends and relatives. the first scene without letour: she sits quietly. a corrections officer instructs the visitors to proceed. ann walks through a concrete corridor, finds the visiting area. letour, in prison fatigues, sits at a table. he sees her, smiles. ann sits down. this is not her first visit.}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{hello.}

<C>__{letour}
<D>__{sentencing's in ten days supposed to be. because of the extenuating circumstances our cooperation they say it won't be more than five years maybe seven. with time served, good behavior, parole, i could be out in two years maybe. i hope.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{it feels like forever.}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{it's not so bad. it's a relief in a way at least so far. i've been writing, reading.}

<D>__{how's business?}
<C>__{ann}

<D>__{you had a hard on...}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{i didn't }
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{you tried...}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{i was thinking about it and i realized we never really did. it's one of the things i think about. it's one of the things i look forward to. i've been looking forward.}
