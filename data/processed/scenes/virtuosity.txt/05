<B>__{inside the prison cafeteria}
<A>__{parker eats at a table with a dozen other inmates. the food is unrecognizable. the air thick with humidity and cigarette smoke. nobody is talking. just staring. at parker. parker forces down the remainder of his meal, then returns his utensils to a bin. and heads to the bathroom. all eyes following parker's every move. the other inmates then turn their attentions to a man of incredible size following parker. 6' 6", 255 lbs. his face covered with red scar tissue from burns suffered long ago. this is big red. he follows parker into the bathroom.}

<A>__{graffiti covers the walls. red uses a stained urinal, then turns to the stalls. a pair of prisonissue shoes and socks are visible beneath one of them.}

<D>__{time to hurt...}
<A>__{red kicks in the door to the stall. revealing a pair of shoes and socks stuffed with a prison shirt. red hears something behind him. and turns around slowly. parker stands barefooted and shirtless. scars are visible around each arm just below the elbow. you will learn what these represent momentarily. parker is six inches shorter and 60 pounds lighter than red. but the punch parker delivers to red's face makes you think it's the other way around. you hear the sound of metal crushing bone. red is thrown backwards into the stall. blood splatters from his mouth, adding another shade of redness to his face. red's teeth stick out of parker's fist. parker pulls out the teeth. he does not bleed. nor seem in pain. metal is visible beneath the surface of his skin. for the first time, you notice small tattoos on the outsides of his palms. they read: wentlow model 17 l, and 17 r, followed by serial numbers. red charges parker wildly. parker dodges him like a matador does a bull. then brings his fists down savagely on the back of red's head. his skull cracks. red drops to the floor. parker jumps on top of him, arms around his neck. choking him. red staggers to his feet. his eyes wide. his face now even redder. parker maintains his mechanical grip. red finally succumbs to the lack of oxygen. he drops to his knees. parker does not relent until he feels the barrel of a gun at the back of his head.}
