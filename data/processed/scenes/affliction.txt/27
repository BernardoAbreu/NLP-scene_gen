<L>__{exterior school morning}
<A>__{wade whitehouse, wearing a reflective vest, waves a district school bus into the parking lot. noisy, jostling grade schoolers emerge from the bus. jill's former classmates. straight as a statue, wade holds back traffic. cars and trucks are backed up on the unplowed road. horns honk and bleat; a woman's voice yells, "whitehouse, we 'ain't got all day!" wade, daydreaming, seems oblivious to the commotion. oblivious or just plum contrary. a shiny black bmw approaches, speeding, passing traffic on the shoulder. a man and a woman in a fur coat sit in front, two children in back. whitehouse waves for it to stop. the bmw accelerates through the intersection, ignoring wade and the traffic. it whizzes past, spinning wade, and is quickly up the road, spewing ice and exhaust. wade slips to one knee. honking ensues; every car goes where it wishes. wade, brushing off snow, follows the last bus as it pulls in. lugene brooks, 60, school principal, rushes over:}
