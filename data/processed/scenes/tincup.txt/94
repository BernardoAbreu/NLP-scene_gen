<L>__{exterior range next morning}
<A>__{the winnebago sits forlornly in the parking lot next to the range which has never looked lonelier. tin cup's caddy convertible pulls up to the winnebago. but roy isn't driving molly is. she gets out, goes to the door. she knocks.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{roy? anybody home?}
<A>__{there's no answer so she tries the door, and walks in on:}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior winnebago morning}
<A>__{tin cup stands there caught, like a deer in the headlights, like a man caught cross dressing, a private confession made public he can't run and he can't hide... roy "tin cup" mcavoy is wearing every gimmick that molly first arrived with plus many more. he wears a pendulum cap, his arms are strapped together, a curious triangular coat hanger type contraption connects his elbows, there's a neck brace, an ankle anchor, an arrow attachment to his left hand, a bucket for right foot, he swings a collapsible club... and a beginners golf video projects loudly from his vcr, so loudly that he never heard her knocking.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{my god...}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{aarghh...}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{roy...}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{dr. griswold...}
<A>__{a moment of pathetic silence, then: molly starts laughing he is destroyed.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{the therapist laughs at her patient? is that how it works? a man is laid bare before god and he's the butt of the cosmic joke?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i just...}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{some of this shit might actually work, y'know... i mean i think there's something to this hat with the pendulum golf ball thing... may be on to something here...}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{oh, roy, jesus... quoting yourself, 'it is the paraphernalia for lost and desperate souls.'}
<A>__{tin cup lets down. the wind goes out of his sails and he loses his defensiveness.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{well, god damn... a lost and desperate soul stands before you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i assume i have the confidentiality of doctor client privilege in regards to this outfit?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{of course you do. what happened?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i got the shanks.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{are you taking penicillin?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{it can't be treated! it's much worse than whatever you thought it was.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there's a glitch in my swing.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{so it's in romeo's department?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{he thinks it's your department says it's a head thing.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{oh. well. i just came over to congratulate you on the regionals and return your car david says he doesn't want it, just wanted to make a point with you }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but i suppose we could have a therapy session right here and now }
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i don't want therapy. i want you.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{roy... i gotta get some air }
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{look at me }
<P>__{(considering what that means)}
<D>__{well, not right at the moment but listen to me. you're with the wrong guy. i'm the right guy. everyone tells me my face is all screwed up tight as a drum 'cause i've been crazy about you from the day you showed up wearing this stupid stuff and the whole damn thing has both inspired me to get here on the verge of greatness yet it's also caused me to get the shanks which could humiliate me in front of a zillion people.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{such is life. so dump that phony bastard and come to the open in my corner you can delay your romantic urges, which i know are lurking in there among the excess of brain cells you possess until the appropriate time...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{tell me you're not at least moderately attracted to me.}
<A>__{tin cup stands there with the ball still dangling from his hat, the leather straps, the bucket, the arrows for the moment he's forgotten how stupid he looks.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{you have moments.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{tell me which ones are my moments and i will try to duplicate them.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{this is a moment. you look great.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{now?!}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{utterly exposed, completely vulnerable, the inner child trying to get out.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{my inner child needs spanking.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{you always liked that part about saddling up, the smell of leather }
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{c'mon, let's have a drink. call it therapy. charge me 75 an hour. little cuervo, little freud...}
<A>__{she's thinking about it.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{naw... i gotta go.}
<P>__{(turns to leave)}
<D>__{oh, i don't have a car, i need a ride.}
