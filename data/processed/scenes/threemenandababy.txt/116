<C>__{carl}
<D>__{does she always cry like that?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no, it's only because she's teething, she's usually very sweet...}
<A>__{the guests remain silent.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(to break the silence)}
<D>__{you'd never think something so small could make a noise so big.}
<A>__{mary's crying fills the room.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{what if you just put her back to bed?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{right she's just throwing a temper tantrum, put her to bed...}

<C>__{christie}

<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{we were just saying that this baby's conversation is actually rather limited... and a touch annoying. don't you think?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well, she's not the only one with a limited conversation. at least she has an excuse, she's a baby! what's yours?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i frankly don't know what you mean.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i mean, i've been listening to your pompous drivel about the latest trends for the last two hours, and frankly, it's a crock of horseshit.}
