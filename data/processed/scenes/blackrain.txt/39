<B>__{nick and charlie}
<A>__{trying to shove past the customs inspectors who are wrestling them aside.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{cops! he's our prisoner!}
<A>__{two more policemen arrive. nick and charlie are thrown up against the wall. out come the cuffs. snap!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what's going on? we're the good guys!}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior tokyo police headquarters day}
<A>__{fifty identical desks. fifty identical phones. fifty identically dressed men in white shirts and ties working under the fluorescent lights of this large open room. we glide past the rows of desk to find inspector ohashi, mid forties, sitting behind a perfectly arranged desk. ohashi prides himself on order. nick and charlie are standing in front of him.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{get me something like an identi kit and i will give you a description.}
<A>__{ohashi remains poker faced. he continues to arrange papers and apply his hanko (personal seal) to the bottom of a stack of official papers.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{there must be some witnesses from the airport?}
<A>__{still nothing from the good inspector.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what is it, tea time?}
<A>__{still nothing from ohashi. finally:}
<C>__{ohashi}
<P>__{(quiet rage)}
<D>__{you lost a man we wanted for some time. it was very incompetent on your part, officer.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.}
<A>__{ohashi bows slightly, we're not sure why.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i want a gun.}
<C>__{ohashi}
<D>__{it is not allowed.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{we're police officers.}
<C>__{ohashi}
<D>__{you're foreigners.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{work with me. i want your best detective.}
<A>__{pause. ohashi returns to his papers. nick can't believe it.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{hey, inspector, i don't intend to take the rap for this.}
<C>__{ohashi}
<P>__{(not looking up)}
<D>__{do you know what this is?}
<A>__{ohashi holds up the document that was handed to nick at the airport.}
<C>__{ohashi}
<D>__{it's a laundry list. go home, detective.}
<A>__{nick studies him for a beat, then turns away. to charlie:}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{let's go.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{nick, we can't just }
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i said let's go, charlie.}
<A>__{reluctantly they head towards the door, passing long rows of bureaucrats, telephones ringing off the hook. nick stops at the door, spots a fuse box nearby. he glances back to make sure no one is looking. nick pulls out his handcuffs. charlie can't figure out what the hell he's doing. nick attaches one cuff to the main lever then yanks it down. the lights go out. the fan's stop; so do the typewriters; so does the air conditioning. dead silence. nick attaches the other cuff to a pipe, snaps it shut. now it's impossible to left the main lever. from the far end of the room:}
<C>__{ohashi}
<D>__{what are you doing?!}
<A>__{nick drops the key down the water fountain drain.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{your best detective, ohashi.}
