<L>__{interior bar area day}
<A>__{ the reflection catches the eye of a 40 year old woman having a coffee at the bar with, her 65 year old mother. turning so the sun is out of her eyes causes the daughter to notice the tv: an image of david's famous concession speech from three years ago. a screen graphic reads "announcing today?" as the daughter turns back to look at her mother, she notices david, over her mom's shoulder...}
<B>__{david and elise}
<A>__{david squeezes her hand... and leans in again }
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i just want to say }
<C>__{voice. }
<D>__{i hope the rumors are true, congressman.}
<A>__{david pulls back from elise, suddenly self conscious, turns to see the 40 year old woman richardson just manipulated. she points at the tv report on david's announcement.}
<D>__{40 year old woman you have my vote. 65 year old woman mine too... and i usually disagree with her.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{thanks. thanks a lot.}
<A>__{david turns back to elise.}

<P>__{(needling)}
<D>__{well, you're really just a hit with women of all ages, aren't you?}

<D>__{i'm wrangling him right now }
<B>__{david and elise}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{whatever happens... i'm not going to let anything stand between us this time.}
<A>__{it's such an odd thing to say, if you don't know what david has gone through. she gives him a quizzical look. but she's also moved by his tone}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{okay... i believe you. of course i tend to believe in the wrong people. especially men.}
<A>__{it's the kind of quip that's more truth than jest.}
