<L>__{interior grant kitchen night}
<A>__{starla walks into the kitchen. cooking supplies and condiments are scattered over the floor. she spots a meat thermometer on the floor amongst other utensils. she glances out the rear window. diseased people are guarding the backyard, looking away from the home. she grabs the meat thermometer. she snaps the thermometer part off the top, discards it, and shoves the long metal spike into the seam of her skirt. suddenly, starla hears every woman in the world, the song she and grant danced to earlier, starting to play through tinny speakers. starla looks up through a missing section of ceiling; she can see a tiny piece of grant in the bedroom above her.}
