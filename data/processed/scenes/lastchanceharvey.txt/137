<A>__{kate can't help but smile. beat.}
<P>__{harvey (cont'd (cont'd)}
<D>__{kate, i'm so sorry i wasn't there.}
<A>__{beat. kate takes a breath, and gives him the practical response she's gone over in her head.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{harvey, i like you, i really do. and i had a lovely time it was great. but, you know, i don't really do fountains at noon.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i live in willesden. and you live in }
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{white plains.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{exactly. and we're not teenagers, so you know, monday morning and life kicks in, all that jobs and family and brown envelopes with bills in it was a lovely day and i won't forget it, but it's not exactly real life...}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{it is. it can be.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{no, harvey, it's not.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{kate, i want this. i want you.}
<A>__{a button is pushed in kate.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{but it's not just about you, is it?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you don't know anything about me. look at me. it's pathetic. i expected you not to show for god's sake. i think i even wanted you not to be there, it's easier that way.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you you just dive in wherever, deep end, whoosh. but, i'm not your bloody swimming pool harvey.}
<P>__{(starting to break)}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{and i am not going to do it, i'm not going to do it because it will hurt. not right now, maybe, but soon there will be a "it's not quite working is it" or a "i need some space" or whatever it is and it'll end and it'll hurt and i won't do it, i won't and...i...oh fuck, i don't want to cry. i don't want this...}
<A>__{kate turns and walks away, standing by the balustrade, looking down at the river below. harvey watches. she takes a seat on a bench. harvey gives her, her space. then slowly he approaches, leaning against a tree nearby. long beat.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{i think it's actually easier for me to be disappointed. i think i'm actually angry at you for trying to take that away.}
<A>__{long beat. just then kate's phone rings. she reaches into her bag and takes it out. she stares at the phone, thinking for a beat, before answering.}
<C>__{kate }
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{mum, i love you, but not now.}
<A>__{she hangs up. long beat.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{should i take that as a hopeful sign?}
<A>__{kate can't help but smile.}
<C>__{harvey }
<D>__{if you just give me a little wider smile.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(smiling laughing)}
<D>__{oh, shut up, harvey.}
<A>__{beat. kate collecting herself, looks up at harvey.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{so how's this going to work, mr shine?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{i have absolutely no idea...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but it will.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i promise you that.}
<A>__{kate stares at harvey for the longest while. then...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{shall we walk?}
<A>__{beat. harvey nods.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{kate gathers up her things, stands and joins harvey. they begin to walk. after a short while kate stops, puts her hand on harvey's shoulder and takes off her shoes.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{that's better.}
<A>__{harvey glances down at kate's feet, then up at her.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{i think you're my kinda girl.}
<A>__{harvey and kate smile. and as they walk away from us we hear.}
<C>__{harvey }
<D>__{why don't you ask me those questions?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{which ones?}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{you know, from the airport. when i wouldn't stop.}
<C>__{kate}
