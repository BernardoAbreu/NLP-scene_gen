<L>__{exterior annie hayworth's house full shot}
<A>__{melanie is standing on the front steps, a paper bag in her hands. she rings the doorbell. the room to let sign is still in the window. the door suddenly opens.}

<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{oh, hi!}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{did you find her all right?}
<A>__{two shot melanie and annie}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{yes, i did.}
<A>__{there is a long awkward pause. annie smiles expectantly at melanie. melanie seems hesitant.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i was wondering...}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{that sign.}
<P>__{(pause)}

<C>__{annie}
<D>__{well, i'd really hope to rent it for...}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i would appreciate it. i've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{sure. you can have it.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{where's your bag? in the car?}

<D>__{it's utilitarian, i will say that for it.}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i just picked up some things for the night at the general store. you see, i hadn't planned on spending much time here.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{yes, i know. did something unexpected crop up?}
<A>__{there is a moment where both women look at each other... when melanie answers, it is abrupt and a trifle cold she is again telling annie to mind her own business.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{may i use your phone? i'd like to call home.}
<A>__{there is another moment where annie appraises melanie's attitude, and then accepts it. she suddenly smiles warmly.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{why don't you come in then? i was just about to mix a martini.}
<A>__{she is about to lead melanie into the house when they both hear a sound overhead. they turn to look skyward. long shot a flock of large birds flying in beautiful precise formation against the sky. two shot annie and melanie}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{don't they ever stop migrating?}
<A>__{but melanie is watching the sky and the birds with a curiously serious expression.}
