<L>__{exterior perimeter #2 jungle night}
<A>__{the stars are out in magnificent splendor. a breeze rustling through the trees.}
<L>__{exterior perimeter #2 chris' position night}
<A>__{chris is turning in his sleep, perturbed, writhing. the whispering is more and more urgent. death is all around. he shoots up out of his poncho liner as if shot, stunned. scared. looks around. all is quiet. men sleeping. elias is huddled in his poncho on guard next to his foxhole. chris joins him, sitting, wiping the sleep from his eyes.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{... i can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{... don't feel like it either.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{... beautiful night.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{yeah. i love this place at night. the stars ... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{that's a nice way of putting it.}
<A>__{elias cuffs a joint, keeping its glow hidden in the dark. a pause, both of them meditative.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{barnes got it in for you, don't he?}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(philosophically)}
<D>__{barnes believes in what he's doing.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{and you, do you believe?}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{in '65 yeah. now ...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{no. what happened today's just the beginning. we're gonna lose this war ...}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{you really think so ... us?}
<A>__{elias' eyes seem to go to some inner place, his passion surging.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{... we been kicking other people's asses so long i guess it's time we got our own kicked. the only decent thing i can see coming out of here are the survivors hundreds of thousands of guys like you taylor going back to every little town in the country knowing something about what it's like to take a life and what that can do to a person's soul twist it like barnes and bunny and make 'em sick inside and if you got any brains you gonna fight it the rest of your life cause it's cheap, killing is cheap, the cheapest thing i know and when some drunk like o'neill starts glorifying it, you're gonna puke all over him and when the politicians start selling you a used war all over again, you and your generation gonna say go fuck yourself 'cause you know, you've seen it, and when you know it, deep down there ...}
<A>__{he plants his fist in chris' gut, expelling his breath such is the force of the blow like a power passed between them.}
<C>__{elias }
<D>__{... you know it till you die ... that's why the survivors remember. 'cause the dead don't let em forget.}
<A>__{his eyes blazing, reliving the deaths in the village, licking the wounds for the platoon, mourning the failure of its heroism. chris looking at him, a little awed by his intensity. elias looks away, embarrassed that he has sermonized, looks back at the stars.}
<C>__{elias }
<D>__{oh shit! sometimes there's things in my head ... man. grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy indian ...}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{do you believe that stuff about ... knowing you're gonna die?}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{yeah, those are the guys that live. i really don't think death gives a shit, it's like a giant garbage can, i think it takes whatever it can get ... you never know where it's gonna come from anyway ... so why spin your wheels?}
<A>__{he shrugs, a certain bravado masking his own uncertainty.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{... you ever think about reincarnation, all that stuff?}
<A>__{a lightning quick movement follows. elias' hand passing over his face like a mime, a click of the fingers and he leans closer to chris. a new expression on his face. devil's eyes, mocking child, danger in his soul, excitement, sex the elias that chris saw in the smoking session in base camp. chris smiles, sucked in, almost laughs and then the face is gone again.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{sure, goes on all the time. maybe a piece of me's in you now, who knows. but when you die really die that's a big return ticket.}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{i like to think i'm gonna come back as ... as wind or fire or a deer}
<P>__{(likes the image)}
<D>__{... yeah, a deer ...}
<A>__{he smiles at the thought. chris looks at him, looks away. a shooting star falls suddenly and dryly through the cosmos. their eyes.}
