<A>__{jacob is the only passenger getting off. the doors close quickly behind him. he glances at the lady sitting by the window. there is a fearful expression on her face as the train carries her back into the dark tunnel, out of his sight. jacob reaches the exit, a huge metal revolving door surrounded by floor to ceiling gates. he is about to push when he notices a chain locking it shut. he stares at it in disbelief.}

<D>__{goddam it.}
<A>__{he turns in a huff and hikes to the other end of the platform. as he approaches the far exit, his eyes widen. the gate there is also locked. his hands reach for his hips as he studies an impossible situation.}
