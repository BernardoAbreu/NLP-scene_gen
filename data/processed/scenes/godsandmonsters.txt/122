<L>__{exterior clay's house night}
<A>__{clay carries a large metal bin down the tidy lawn. the sky momentarily brightens with a silent flash of lightning. clay gazes up at the electrical storm. he glances back at his house, sees dana cradling the baby in an upstairs window. the skies open with a shattering crash of thunder. clay tilts up his face, drinks in the cool rain. then he extends his arms and staggers along the sidewalk, imitating the monster's famous lurch. we pull back, revealing a sleepy neighborhood of small houses and neat lawns, until clay is only a small dot in the landscape.}
