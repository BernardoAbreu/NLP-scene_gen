<A>__{rambo half supports de fravio with one arm and fires his ak with the other as they slog through the calf deep water. mortar rounds explode on all sides. they watch the uh 60 skimming in low across the paddies, blasting up a curtain of spray. almost to them... it veers in a tight bank and climbs out. heads away.}

<D>__{hey, zen hammer, where are you going?}

<A>__{the water is shot into spray around them. a mortar shell lands so close it knocks them down, drenching them with slimy black mud. the radio disappears in the water. rising, brewer takes a round in the thigh. drops. disappears for a second... comes up gasping. rambo watches the uh 60 diminishing to a black dot. he is so consumed with rage that his expression goes slack... blank... a murderous disconnection from conscience. and yet, in that same moment, a tremendous surge of blind will clears his mind, a determination to survive, to get out at whatever cost... to find whoever did this. it is no longer just a mission. it is a very personal piece of business. he turns and lets his rifle drop into the water. he takes de fravio's and throws it away.}

<D>__{the fuckers left us, man... they left us.}
<A>__{brewer wallows weakly, his blood streaming out into the muddy water. de fravio looks stunned, lost... eviscerated. he sags to his knees.}

<A>__{it gets quiet. in a ragged line, the nva soldiers advance to the top of the dike. twenty. forty. finally almost eighty, looking down at the americans. rambo slowly raises his hands.}
