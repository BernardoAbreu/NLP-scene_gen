<L>__{interior television studio day (1974)}
<A>__{the `calender' front title sequence, a yorkshire tv current affairs program. we're in a tv studio. the presenter is austin mitchell, (40)..}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{today we welcome brian clough as he starts his new job as manager of leeds united, taking over from don revie the most successful manager in the club's history, under whom leeds have won everything..}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{..not quite everything. not won the european cup...}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{...but pretty much everything else. daunted?}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{daunted? not at all, austin. looking forward to it.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{the biggest challenge of your life, and you'll be without peter taylor, for the first time. your lifelong professional colleague.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{yes, pete's at brighton now. he had the opportunity to come with me, but brighton was his choice. leeds was mine.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{a surprising choice, some might say. because you've been very vocal in your criticism of them over the years.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{i have.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{you've accused players of dirty tactics, cheating, dissent, foul play. you called norman hunter, norman "bites yer legs" hunter, you've said peter lorimer falls when no one touches him...}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{and i was right.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{i'm curious. why do you now show such alacrity to joining them after such vituperative criticism of them for so long?}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{goodness, it's going to take me half an hour to explain all those words for a start.}
<A>__{laughter from the camera crew..}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{football is a beautiful game, austin. it needs to be played beautifully. i think leeds have sold themselves short...}
