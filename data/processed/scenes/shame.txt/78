<A>__{brandon, now the voyeur, looks across the room, into marianne's office. he studies her, almost like prey. the moment seems to last a lifetime. there is much want in brandon's face, but from this distance seems unobtainable. suddenly, and without any warning, brandon walks into his dream, entering marianne's office, and pulls her behind a partition, kissing her unapologetically and passionately. she responds, startled, but happy to be taken. she surrenders. they pull away, looking at one another. she smiles, laughing, his spirit infectious, drawing her on.}
