<D>__{you already did a neurological work up?}
<C>__{dr. cutler}
<D>__{yep. no tumors, no aneurisms, no sign of stroke }
<A>__{ben slaps vitti's face lightly a couple times.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{completely catatonic }
<A>__{he pulls on vitti's ears and nose. vitti does not react.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{totally gone. well, i don't think he's smart enough to be faking. street smart, yes, but we're talking about an i.q. just north of a bedroom slipper.}
<A>__{ben checks vitti out of the corner of his eye. no reaction. then ben takes a sharp needle from an instrument tray.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{so if i just stuck him with this needle, he probably wouldn't even respond.}
<C>__{dr. cutler}
<D>__{i don't know. try it.}
<A>__{ben hesitates for a moment to see if vitti will crack, then}
<C>__{ben}

<A>__{he sticks the needle into vitti's shoulder.}
