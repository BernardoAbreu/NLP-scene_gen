<D>__{...with the air pressure pushing up, he'll never smell the bait!}
<C>__{sergeant o'neal}
<P>__{(turning to soldier)}
<D>__{get some men down into those air vents. shut 'em down!}
<L>__{interior subterranean air vent moments later night}
<A>__{with a loud whine we hear the vents shutting down. the large whirling fan blades slow to a stop.}
<L>__{exterior flat iron square same}
<A>__{one by one the steam pillars begin to disappear as the vents are turned off. there is a long tense moment of waiting. when will it come? will it come? before the young officer can stop him, nick rushes over to a manhole cover in the center of the street. the cover is to heavy. he yells back.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{we need to open all the manhole covers in the area. let the scent waft down.}
<A>__{the young officer signals other soldiers. nick steps back and lets the soldiers go to work. as he walks back, he spots another manhole cover at the next intersection down a side street. he runs over to it. angle side street manhole cover a particularly heavy one in the center of this intersection (a block away from flat iron square), nick, alone, wrestles to remove it. with all his might, he drags it clear. suddenly, through the hole he hears some strange noises from below. rattled, he slowly backs away from the hole. the noises grow increasingly louder. then with a deafening roar, the ground behind nick erupts and godzilla rises, ripping up the boulevard as he does. nick spins only to find himself face to face with the gigantic creature. godzilla's head slopes down, apparently looking nick in the eye. all around foot soldiers appear, guns trained, shoulder hoisted rocket launchers prepared. out of the corner of his eye, nick sees all this. he gently signals with his hands that they should not fire. sensing no danger from nick, godzilla simply steps over nick. nick's pov under godzilla as the gargantuan creature walks over us, making a beeline for the fish. nick turns and runs, following him.}
