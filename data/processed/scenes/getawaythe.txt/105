<A>__{as doc thumbs idly through the newspaper. he is suddenly showered with spurting water. he lowers the paper and looks to the aisle, seeing: a seven year old black panther, dressed appropriately and holding a water pistol.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{stick 'em up!}
<A>__{doc looks at the brat.}
<C>__{kid }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i'm gonna shoot you...}
<A>__{he squeezes the pistol's trigger, two bursts of water land on doc's shirt front. doc continues staring at the boy. the kid looks hard at doc, not giving an inch.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{come here a second...}
<A>__{doc takes the boy's arm, gently pulls him closer.}
<C>__{doc }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{look, i'm sure you're a nice kid and that your mother's nearby...}
<A>__{now you better get back to her real quick or i'm going to break your little arm... okay? doc releases the boy. the kid looks at doc for a moment then bursts into tears and retreats at a dead run back down the passenger car aisleway. doc again lifts the paper, turning to the sports page.}
