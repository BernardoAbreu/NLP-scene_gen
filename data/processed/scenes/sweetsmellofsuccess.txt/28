<A>__{rita is in a flurry of indignation. sitting on the bed, she is fastening one high heeled shoe. sidney stands glaring at her.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{don't you know who that man is?}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(bitingly)}
<D>__{yeah. otis elwell. the columnist.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(nodding with emphasis)}
<D>__{yeah!}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(aggressively)}
<D>__{and he's a perfect stranger to me.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(explosively)}
<D>__{so take five minutes! get acquainted! he's an important man he's lonely don't be dumb!}
<A>__{rita, who one shoe on, has begun to search for the other.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{what do you want all of a sudden lady godiva...? where's my other shoe?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what kind of an act is this?}
<A>__{rita jumps to her feet. her righteous indignation is handicapped by the lop sided stance caused by the lack of one shoe.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{don't you think i have any feelings? what am i? a bowl of fruit? a tangerine that peels in a minute?}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(caustic)}
<D>__{i beg your pardon! i turn myself inside out to help you and now i'm a heavy.}
<P>__{(stooping swiftly as he discovers her shoe)}
<D>__{here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!}
<A>__{contemptuously he thrusts the coat and the shoe into her arms. the positive force of his manner gives the girl pause. there is a silence. rita searches for words to explain the offense to her sensibilities.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{sidney...i...i don't do this sort of thing...}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what sort of thing?}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(emphatic)}
<D>__{this sort of thing!}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(as emphatic)}
<D>__{listen, you need him for a favor, don't you! and so do i! i need his column tonight.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{didn't you ask me to do something about your job? don't you have a kid in military school?}
<A>__{a pause. sidney has struck brutally home. rita's lower lip trembles.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{you're a snake, falco. you're a louse, a real louse.}
<A>__{sidney's manner becomes swiftly sympathetic but still urgent.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(persuasively)}
<D>__{honey he's going to help you! you want to lose your job?}
<A>__{rita begins to waver, her moral indignation losing ground before sidney's reminders of her dire necessity.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(remonstrating)}
<D>__{a girl needs a little romancing before she }
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(cutting in)}
<D>__{next time i will call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(in a small voice)}
<D>__{what would you think of me if }
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(cutting in to reassure her)}
<D>__{nothing i didn't think of you before.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(dryly, with significance)}
<D>__{ that's what i mean!}
<A>__{this attempt at humor signals to sidney that he has brought her round. he comes to her, pats her in an encouraging manner to which she does not respond. he turns to the door, and picks up the glasses she has set down on the table behind it.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(as he opens the door)}
<D>__{how many snorts does it take to put you in that tropical island mood?}
<A>__{sidney goes out. sidney's office elwell overhears the last remark and as sidney passes him, he winks. while sidney pours another drink, elwell faces the doorway. rita comes into it, stands on the threshold. she is still far from enthusiastic.}
<C>__{elwell}
<P>__{(an inspiration)}
<D>__{havana! that's where we met!}
<A>__{rita shakes her head morosely. sidney comes and puts a stiff drink into her hand. elwell raises the glass toasting the girl, encouraging her to drink. rita responds dimly.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(to otis)}
<D>__{here's mud in your column!}
<A>__{sidney laughs, more from relief than from the joke.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{blessings on thee, the both...well... gotta run now. see you two kids later!}
<C>__{elwell}
<P>__{(lightly)}
<D>__{hurry back.}
<A>__{at the door sidney takes cheerful leave of them.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{don't do anything i wouldn't do. that gives you lots of leeway.}
<A>__{hallway outside sidney's apartment closing the door, sidney seems pleased with himself. he goes swiftly down the stairs.}
