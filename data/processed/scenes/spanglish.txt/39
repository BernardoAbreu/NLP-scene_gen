<L>__{interior exterior clasky house backyard night}
<A>__{john's pov deborah and two female caterers. deborah is wearing a party dress. they are rolling out the last huge cylinder of sod, completing the now beautifully manicured backyard. it is hard manual labor involving physical strength. the female caterers are complaining that it's too heavy but deborah is undeterred.}
<C>__{deborah}
<P>__{(to catering women)}
<D>__{we can do it. come on.}
<A>__{she falls over the roll..getting filthy..but it gives and they gain momentum...one of the catering women falling down, one losing pace.. deborah,however, gains the upper hand. yet, even while succeeding, she remonstrates herself.}
<C>__{deborah }
<P>__{(great exertion)}
<D>__{why... do... i... care.. so.. much.. about.... crap?}
<A>__{and now she wins.. the cylinder of grass rolls all the way out and she jumps on the seam in victory. she is dirty, spent and triumphant..the components for a solid sexual experience..and, in truth, as the exhausted caterers half heartedly applaud the bizarre victory, she has gotten off. she looks with mother's pride at the lawn. then sees john.}
<C>__{deborah }
<D>__{can you believe they left without finishing?}
<A>__{as she looks at her handiwork john looks at her..a grin..half laugh.. he loves the dame.}
<D>__{deborah (breathless) (cont'd) looks great, huh?.... you're not looking.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i was getting a kick looking at you look at it.}
<A>__{not the answer she wanted..}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{i better get dressed again in case anybody's just a half hour late.}
<A>__{she hits a switch at the door and the backyard area is now fully illuminated set up for a dinner party for 20 or so....all details thought about and done to a "t". this is the outdoor lighting nobody nails..the twinkling of a half acre..the path to the pool like a runway to heaven. as she looks at it all she has a wistful moment.}
<C>__{deborah }
<P>__{(a replenishing sigh)}
<D>__{okay..we're okay here.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{why can't everything be like sod? there's no wait, no dung, nothing you have to do right and yet it's perfect. it covers up all your dirt and makes things immediately pretty..then, the miracle, if you just give it time, it roots and you can't tell it from the real thing.}
<P>__{(a look to her husband)}
<D>__{no reaction. nothing to say.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{huh? oh sure..i, uh..well, no, i don't have anything particular to say.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{oh, john why don't you just take out a knife and kill me all together.}
<A>__{somewhat crushed, she prepares to exit.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{how'd you get there..hey, wait a minute..deb..stop..come on.}
<P>__{(she turns)}
<D>__{i'd like to figure this one out. what would have been the great thing for me to say after you said the sod sentence?..really.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{that's actually a good question.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{there you go. i surprise sometimes.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{i would have liked, if after i compared the sod to life, if you had said, "exactly!"}
<A>__{she turns to leave.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yeah. but to say that and mean it i'd have to think the same way you do.}
<C>__{deborah}
<P>__{(some sense of mischief)}
<D>__{it's worth a try...i had something else to tell you...it'll come to me..}
