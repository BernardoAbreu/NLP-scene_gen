<L>__{interior train car night}
<A>__{chris goes into his pack, grabs his canteen and drinks some water. mid sip, the train begins to make a surprising stop. screeching wheels on track. chris is alarmed. as he moves to peer out the door, even before he has a chance to see what's coming wham! he's smashed in the head with a baton. a bull jumps into the car with him.}
<D>__{bull #2 lay down on your stomach, spread eagle!}
<A>__{chris turns to reason with the man. and that's all it takes six straight blows to the ribs, legs, and arms. we hear it more than we see it. chris is in agony.}
<P>__{bull #2 (cont'd)}
<D>__{let me see your face.}
<A>__{the bull shines a flashlight into chris' eyes.}
<P>__{bull #2 (cont'd)}
<D>__{i never, ever, ever forget a face. if i see yours again, i won't arrest you. i will kill you. this is the god damned railroad. and we will do whatever we have to, to keep you freeloaders from violating our liability.}
<A>__{chris is trying to understand what the man is saying.}
<P>__{bull #2 (cont'd)}
<D>__{if one of you people gets hurt on our train, we are liable. do you understand that?}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(despite the violent irony)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, sir. bull #2 you have i.d.?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{no, sir. bull #2 of course you don't.}
