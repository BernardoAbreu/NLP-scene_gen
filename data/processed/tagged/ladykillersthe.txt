<A>__{mrs. munson is walking home. it is a beautiful spring day. from far off, wafting toward us on the breeze, we can hear the church chorus singing. mrs. munson joins in. she has a strong voice:}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{leaning, leaning, safe and secure from all harm. lean on jesus, lean on jesus, leaning on the everlasting arm.}
<A>__{she turns up the walk to her house.}

<A>__{it races off down the street.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{...pickles!}
<L>__{exterior mississippi river bridge day}
<A>__{pickles scurries along the walkway. we hear the toot! of an approaching scow. the cat reaches the middle of the bridge. he sticks his head through the bars of the railing. when we cut close : on the cat as he looks down at the water, we see that he holds in his mouth a human finger. as the scow passes underneath, the cat opens its mouth and lets the finger drop. the finger falls away and is barely visible by the time it hits the scow. the cat looks up into the lens, and blinks. its sideways irises adjust. the scow is gliding away. with the low mournful toot of its horn we tilt up the river to the great garbage island where scavenger birds pick through the trash.}
