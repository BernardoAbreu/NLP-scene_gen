<A>__{kirk is drying his shirt. a man is still zipping up as he takes the next sink. before washing, he offers a handshake.}

<D>__{excuse me. my name is max fleming. i'm a financial planner.}
<A>__{kirk takes the handshake reluctantly and then gets a business card. max then starts to wash up so does kirk.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh, hi.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{please forgive me but i'm curious. who manages your portfolio?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{my portfolio? i don't really...}
<A>__{max takes the last paper towel forcing kirk to drip dry.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{it's okay if you'd rather not say. i admit that selling my services in a men's room is a tad aggressive but isn't that what a man of your means requires in his financial planner?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{my means.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{judging by the company you're keeping, i'd say that you're making a handsome living. i can help you do even better.}
