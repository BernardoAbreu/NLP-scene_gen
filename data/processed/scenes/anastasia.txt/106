<A>__{sophie, flanked by her sisters, sits at a table. anya, looking nervous but poised, sits across while dmitri and vladimir hover nervously at the far end of the room. sophie's pat cat, tillie, attempts to cuddle up next to meetoo, who wants nothing to do with her.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{i'd just like to ask you a few questions, dear...}
<A>__{sophie opens a huge book that slams open. vlad and dmitri jump.}

<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{where were you born?}
<B>__{scene continues mos time lapse montage}
<A>__{dmitri watches anya answer questions gracefully and without hesitating. anya smiles as her answers begin to surprise sophie.}
<C>__{dmitri }
<D>__{the real anastasia couldn't have grown up to be lovelier.}
<A>__{sophie and the sisters look tired. sophie has her last question.}
<C>__{sophie}
<P>__{(almost giggling)}
<D>__{this is the hard one ... what rare treat was served on the night of the three hundredth anniversary of the romanov dynasty? the last ball they ever had?}
<A>__{dmitri and vladimir exchange a nervous look. it's obvious they never briefed anya on this one. anya thinks a moment, then looks up, smiling, as she remembers ...}
<C>__{anya}
<D>__{father had fresh tropical fruits sent in. oranges and pineapples from the far east. i remember ... i remember i threw an orange to a young boy who was hiding under a table...}
<A>__{dmitri is shocked. he know this is anastasia romonov and he can't believe it.}
<C>__{sophie}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{yes ... yes, it was fresh fruit. well, maybe not "fresh" estelle got one rather brown banana but ...}
<B>__{close on}
<A>__{dmitri, as he stares at anya as sophie prattles on.}
<B>__{minutes later}
<A>__{anya sits near the window, stroking tillie ... much to the consternation of a jealous meetoo., she looks out the window and sees dmitri, deep in thought, wandering in the garden. out of her earshot at the other end of the room, vladimir speaks to sophie.}
<C>__{vladimir}
<D>__{are you impressed with our anastasia?}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{oh, heavens i must say, yes.}
