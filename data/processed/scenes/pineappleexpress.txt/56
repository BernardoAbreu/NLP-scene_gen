<L>__{exterior crackhead park night}
<A>__{there are several tarp houses set up, garbage all over, and crazy dangerous homeless people milling about the park. a deranged looking homeless man walks over to another one and starts pissing on his leg. they begin fist fighting. suddenly, a half eaten hamburger hits dale in the face and a bag lady comes up to saul and starts poking him.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{hey, stop it. stop it. you wanna buy some weed, or, like, what?}
<A>__{the bag lady runs off.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{see, that's the problem around here. target demographic has a real, uh, fickle attention span. you gotta wow `em.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{hey! who wants some weed!?!}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{fuck this place.}
