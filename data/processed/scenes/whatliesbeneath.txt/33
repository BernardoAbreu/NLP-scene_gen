<B>__{of norman and claire.}
<A>__{the caption announces that he's being promoted to the "distinguished dupont chair in genetics." through the spiderwebbed glass, norman can be seen shaking hands with an older academic, hugging a smiling claire to his side. claire kneels down to gather the picture. a single shard of glass is missing. she finds it a foot away by a distinctive knot in the wood floor. she notices a copper glint in the point of glass, but when she moves it, it's gone. she places the pieces of broken glass on the frame and stands. out of the window directly in front of her sees: mr. feur, removing a dirt covered shovel from his trunk. she glances down at the picture, then back up at mr. feur, who carries the shovel around back.}
