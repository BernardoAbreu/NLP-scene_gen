<A>__{the cause of the excitement is hasari running toward us, feet flying, as he pulls the rickshaw, loaded with a huge sack. manooj and shambu are clinging to the sides of the machine. ram stands in the center of the square. he shouts a command and hasari struggles to bring the rickshaw to a stop. it's not easy and sunil who's arriving has to jump out of the way to the accompaniment of apologies from hasari and ram and hoots of laughter from the children. outside the clinic, a line of perhaps seventy five wait patiently, watching as hasari takes off again. the wheels of the rickshaw hit a rut. hasari loses control, the sack tips back and hasari is lifted into the air, feet kicking as he tries to regain his balance. aloka and amrita, sitting near the bawling ram, can't hold back their laughter.}
