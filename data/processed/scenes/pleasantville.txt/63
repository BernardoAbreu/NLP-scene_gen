<L>__{interior doctor's office. day.}
<A>__{it is a typical '50s family practice right out of norman rockwell. there is a jar of tongue depressors on the counter and a jar of lollipops beside them. lisa anne (mary sue's best friend) is being examined by dr. henderson. her mother sits at her side.}

<D>__{let me see it again.}
<A>__{lisa anne opens her mouth and sticks out a bright red tongue. everything else in the frame is black and white, but her tongue literally gleams with color.}
<C>__{dr. henderson }

<D>__{well ... i don't think it's anything to worry about ... it'll probably just clear up by itself.}
<P>__{(to lisa anne)}

<P>__{(aside to the mother)}
<D>__{it's just a "teenage" thing.}
