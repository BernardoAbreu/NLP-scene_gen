<A>__{a series of shots as slumber overtakes the holidome in joan ostrowski fox's room: joan is bent over her tub, applying a clairol nice `n' easy home hair color kit. she gets up, puts on a shower cap . she applies cold cream to her face. she looks tired and decidedly middle aged. in the hallway: bree drunkenly escorts a different insurer back to his room. in the junior suite bedroom: ronald sleeps soundly, gently snoring. tim tosses and turns in his cot. he looks out into the living room where he sees: deanzie at the desk chair, gently masturbating. we move in to see what he's looking at: a photo of a woman in a bikini. she's attractive enough, carrying a few too many pounds. certainly no supermodel. pull out to reveal: the woman is the subject of a christmas photo card. the typed script reads, happy holidays from dean & patti ziegler. christmas `93, panama city beach, fla. next to the woman stands a younger, slimmer deanzie.}
