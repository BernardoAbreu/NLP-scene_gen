<A>__{being pulled through an airport. the little heads of ryan's sister and her fiance are poking out the top of the bag. the two zippers have been closed on either side of them as though they were tiny passengers peeking out the sunroof.}

<A>__{ryan cuts right through the crowd, wheeling his carry on towards the automatic check in machines. ryan stops when he notices natalie saying goodbye to her boyfriend a kind of hollister looking guy in his mid twenties. he's not thrilled by the public affection. after a beat, they break and he exits. natalie sees ryan and starts dragging her large suitcase towards him. the scraping against the terrazzo sends a shiver up ryan's spine. she arrives and sets the heavy bag down with a clunk. ryan stares at her travel case for a beat then up to her.}
