<D>__{i'm totally excited about this audition. it's such a great part. it's supporting but she's a really funny character. there's this totally hilarious scene where she's dating this like chauvinist older guy and just as they're about to do it, the guy moans and she thinks he's just really into her, right? except he's having a heart attack and she's like creeped out and her mother, who basically despises the guy, rushes in, gives him cpr and saves his life.}
