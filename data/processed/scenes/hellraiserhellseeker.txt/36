<L>__{interior trevor's apt. day}
<A>__{ trevor sits bolt upright in his bed. his alarm clock is making that same buzzing noise. trevor is completely disoriented. he sees a note laying next to him on the bed. it says iyou're an animal baby... you know who...i he finally looks at the clock. seven forty five.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{shit, i'm gonna be late!}
<L>__{interior trevor's cubicle day}
<A>__{trevor is on his computer typing madly. on the screen we see he has accessed the local newspaper. he calls up an article reading: accident leaves one hospitalized another missing. he looks at a newspaper picture of the bridge, which is humming with rescue activity. trevor's head is pounding. he goes into his desk drawer and pulls out a bottle of aspirin. trevor empties the last of the bottle's six tablets into his hand, downs them, chases them with what's left of an economy sized bottle of mylanta. trevor can't seem to even look at his computer screen. he hears a ding ding and looks up. he has an instant office message waiting. trevor clicks ok. the instant message reads: iit's too late.i trevor rapidly types up. iwho is this.i the same message is repeated. iit's too late. it's too late. it's too late.i trevor stands up and looks around mazelike structure of cubicles as far as he can see. all of his co workers are slaving away on their keypads. trevor sits back down and cancels the instant message. he ruminates for a moment. from behind bret's fingers tapping on the keyboard seem to get louder, more frustrated. they finally stop and bret stretches momentarily.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{must be nice.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{getting paid for doing shit.}
<A>__{bret goes back to work again, fingers hammering away.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{come on, bret.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{seriously man, you oughta work for the government. you've got the sense of urgency for it.}
<A>__{trevor himself begins to type, slowly, reluctantly.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{look, i'm doing my best considering okay?}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{hey if the boss doesn't notice who cares right? just slack all the live long day if you want.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{the boss won't notice me doing a bad job because i'm not. even if the boss thought i was slacking i'd know right away.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{yeah, how's that?}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(smug)}
<D>__{i have my connections}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{really? do tell.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{gwen.}
<A>__{bret freezes. he then looks at trevor, eyes bulging.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{gwen?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i crap you not. she was all over me yesterday in the break room. and she was a total machine last night too.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{you were supposed to have a date with gwen last night? gwen deardon? the supervisor?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{serious as a heart attack my friend. i think she literally fucked me brains out.}
<C>__{bret}
<P>__{(super sarcastic)}
<D>__{wow that's quite a feat trevor congratulations. must be really tough to get your brains fucked out by a corpse.}
<A>__{trevor stops and looks at bret.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{me? this is your sick joke man. gwen was murdered here six months ago. the security guard found her all over her office. her head was in the waste paper basket. her stomach was in the filing cabinet. her ass was on the copy machine...}
<A>__{trevor is speechless.}
<C>__{bret }
<D>__{they never found the sicko who did it... remember?}
<A>__{trevor still can't speak. he goes into his computer mailbox and re opens the file he'd received from iyou know who.i he stifles a scream when he sees the jpegs have changed. sure they're still of gwen. pieces of her swimming in puddles of her own blood. where it once said iwork harderi it now says ipolice file.i}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{jesus christ...}
<A>__{trevor looks behind him to make sure bret hasn't seen any of this. he's facing his own computer typing away.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{man are you ever out of the loop. either that or you've got the worst sense of humor this side of jeffrey dahmer. what is your problem anyway?}
<A>__{trevor quickly deletes the entire file. finally...}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{honestly bret? i think i lost my mind. and now i'm finding pieces of it, like pieces of a wrecked car, scattered on the side of the road.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{bud you need to decompress. i told you you came back to work too soon after the accident.}
<A>__{trevor says nothing.}
<C>__{bret }
<D>__{hey you know what trev? i'm going to hook you up man. here...}
<A>__{bret wheels across the cubicle on his chair and hands something to trevor. it's an oddly designed postcard bearing some sort of voodoo mask. the font is faux oriental, the kind they use for chinese take out menus. he looks closer. it's an appointment card for an acupuncturist. sage.}
<C>__{bret }
<D>__{this woman will take one look at you and know exactly what you need.}
