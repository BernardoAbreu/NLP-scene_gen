<L>__{interior kelly's room morning}
<A>__{the sun shines in through kelly's window. he's laying in bed awake has been for a while. he gets up and starts dressing slowly and deliberately. he puts on his best shirt and tie, sensing trouble when the tie's too short. he pulls the suit out of his closet. the jacket doesn't fit. the sleeves don't even go down to his wrists. and he can hardly button the pants. he rips off the jacket. he pulls everything out of his closet. nothing there. he sits on the edge of his bed with his head in his hands. he looks at his dress uniform, hanging on the back of the closet in its dry cleaning bag, right where his mom left it. he shakes his head. no, he couldn't do that. then he sighs.}
