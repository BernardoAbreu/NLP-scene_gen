<L>__{interior elsewhere in the greenhouse. day (minutes later)}
<A>__{luke sits on the side of his cot, in the little tented sleeping area he's created in one corner of the greenhouse. nearby, his hotplate, pots, and some freshly harvested vegetables and greens. the others crouch around him.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{luke, what happened here?}
<A>__{a flash of fear in luke's eyes.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{we fired the radar. it came. they all died.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{what came?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{they all died, but i was spared. why? had to be for a reason. then, all of a sudden, i knew why i was spared.}
<A>__{his voice drops to a conspiratorial whisper.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{so somebody would be left to figure out the secret.}
<A>__{he taps his forehead, significantly, then nods once or twice. the others exchange an uneasy glance.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{luke, we still don't understand.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{come. comecomecome.}
<A>__{he rises quickly and scuttles off, waving an impatient hand, without waiting to see if they'll follow. mcconnell, terri and phil stare after him for a long moment. phil breaks the silence.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{is it just me? or is he about two mealpacks short of a picnic?}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{long term exposure to low gravity can have an adverse impact on the brain. he could be suffering from a form of asphyxia.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{or maybe his whole crew died and he's been marooned alone on mars. let's give him time to adjust.}
<A>__{mcconnell and terri follow in the direction luke went. phil, trailing, mutters to himself.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{greatgreatgreat.}
