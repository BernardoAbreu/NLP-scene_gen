<L>__{interior movie theatre}
<A>__{the light of the screen flickers on an overwhelmingly sullen martha. she moves her leg and knocks a large coke across the floor. she tragically stares at the cola pool. sawyer family t.v. room a dan rather voice booms from the t.v. the sawyers stare.}
<C>__{dan rather voice }
<D>__{oh sure, i will bet even back when i went to school there were drugs, even sex, but they were simpler times. the sherwood suicides tell the bitter truth of today's young. what a waste...oh}
<A>__{veronica snaps off the t.v.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{turn that back on!}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{this condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! get the respect in death you'll never get in life.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{if we're not going to watch that program, can i put on the game?}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{are you trying to tell me it is not a troubled time for the nation's youth?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about joey blow. when that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{i'm lost. you don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. which is it? where are your shoes?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{all we want is to be treated like human beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{i don't patronize bunny rabbits.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{treated like human beings? is that what you said little miss voice of a generation? just how do you think adults act with other adults? you think it's all just doubles tennis. adults can be horrible to other adults. when teenagers complain that they want to be treated like human beings, it's usually because they are being treated like human beings.}
<A>__{veronica leans against the wall with a melancholy smile.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i guess i picked the wrong time to be a human being.}
<A>__{mom is embarassed for getting so involved. she meekly gestures to a tray of pate with a compassionate smile.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{you'll live. want some pate?}
<A>__{heather duke suddenly breezes in the room.}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{hi everyone, door was open. veronica, you missed it! pauline and whitney james were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that martha dumptruck tried to buy the farm. she gave the ticket girl at the colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(repulsed)}
<D>__{is she dead?}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{that's the punchline. she's still alive, in stable condition. another case of a geek trying to imitate the popular people of the school and failing miserably. is that pate?}
<A>__{veronica slaps heather duke in the face.}
