<A>__{troops flood out from one side of the church while children in animal costumes flood out from the other. they criss cross among grave markers and head stones. sam stops abruptly, face to face with the skinny owl. she whispers something, points behind her, and thrusts a folded scrap of paper into sam's hand.}
