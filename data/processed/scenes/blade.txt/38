<D>__{looks like our friend was blood running.}
<P>__{(to gideon)}
<D>__{where were you headed?}
<A>__{gideon mumbles through a split lip and chipped teeth }
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{mphuck you }
<A>__{wham! blade plants gideon's face into the hood of the car. gideon groans, coughs }
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{jesus 1227 brookner holliston clinic }
<A>__{blade releases him, then reaches for his casull.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what are you doing?!}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{preventive medicine.}
<A>__{karen steps in front of blade, shielding gideon.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you can't do this, he's human, it's murder.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{it's war, now get the fuck out of the way!}
<A>__{karen grabs blade's arm, wrestling with him, trying to push his hand away. as the two of them struggle, gideon makes a break for it, stumbling across the lawn. blade pushes karen aside, takes aim, fires but gideon ducks into an alley, disappearing from sight. blade spins on karen, enraged }
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{god damnit!!! do you have any idea what you just did?! he'll warn them. they'll be waiting!}
<A>__{but karen's defiant, she's not backing down.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you were going to kill him. what was i supposed to do?! shut my eyes and pretend i didn't see what i saw?}
<A>__{blade tears off his glasses. karen gasps blade's eyes aren't human, nor are they vampire. they're something else emerald green, laced with swirling flecks of red.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{let me set you straight on something, doctor. what you've "seen" so far is nothing. the world you live in's just the sugar coated topping. there's another world beneath it, the real world and it's a fucking bloodbath. if you want to survive in it, you'd better pull your head out of your ass.}
<A>__{blade slips his glasses back on, leaving karen shocked into silence. he heads for his olds without looking back, climbs in, guns the engine. in seconds, he's gone, tearing off down the street in a cloud of exhaust.}
