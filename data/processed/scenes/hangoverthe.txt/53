<A>__{alan sitting on the banquette, looking awestruck as chastity works a wildly erotic lapdance on him. she crawls onto his lap, she whips him with her long hair, she puts her tongue in his ear. next to him, no longer getting lapdances, vick and stu just sit, staring at chastity, entranced.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i think i know why he married her.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{because if he hadn't, i would've.}
<A>__{they continue watching on in silence.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{is it weird that we're sitting this close watching?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{not for me.}
<A>__{more watching in silence.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i really shouldn't be here. i have daughters.}
<A>__{then both of their heads angle the same way.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{not that can do that.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{how can she do that without dislocating her hip?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{because she's been touched by god.}
<A>__{they continue staring, amazed. just then, the door is kicked open and kikiolani and kalolo fanalua burst into the champagne room, peering through the darkness, looking for our guys. vick and stu see them immediately.}
<C>__{vick }
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{they both hop up. alan remains sitting, however, hypnotized by chastity. vick grabs him.}
<C>__{vick }
<D>__{alan, come on, man, we gotta go!}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{whoa, whoa, i'm smelling the roses }
<A>__{vick literally yanks alan up from the banquette.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{come on, man! we got company!}
<A>__{finally, the guamians spot the guys and lumber for them!}
<C>__{vick }
<D>__{chastity, honey, is there a back way out of here?!}
<A>__{thinking fast, chastity grabs her clothes and darts over to a darkened, unlabeled fire door.}
<C>__{chastity}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{the guys race after her...}
