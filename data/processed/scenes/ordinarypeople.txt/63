<L>__{exterior city business center day}
<A>__{calvin walks with his business partner ray hanley (seen at the party).}
<C>__{ray hanley}
<D>__{well. at least she's an improvement. she doesn't crack gum in your face. that's what you get when your partner does the hiring and firing.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry. that's my fault. i just can never seem to tell anybody that they're not making it.}
<C>__{ray hanley}
<D>__{hold, hold it. wait a minute. that's not the problem. where are you?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ray hanley}
<D>__{i've been losing you these days.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry.}
<C>__{ray hanley}
<D>__{that's okay. that's okay. you off the track?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{they laugh.}
<C>__{ray hanley}
<D>__{come on. i've known you for twenty years. you think i can't tell when something's wrong? how's connie?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{connie's all right. he is. he's okay.}
<C>__{ray hanley}
<D>__{look, i am sorry, it's none of my business, but i think you worry too much. you've been on the rack about him long enough. you're making it a habit. you've gotta let him go sometime.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i'm not on the rack about him.}
<C>__{ray hanley}
<D>__{the thing about it is, in a year he'll be gone. off to michigan or harvard or wherever in the hell he gets it in his head he wants to go. maybe he'll decide to take a tour of europe for a year and not even go to school at all. who knows?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i can't argue with "who knows."}
<C>__{ray hanley}
<D>__{i'm just try giving you the benefit of my experience.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{ray hanley}
<D>__{with valerie, it's more than her living away from home... she's gone. got her own friends, her own life. she breezes in ...for a couple of days on vacations, but... i don't know, maybe girls are different. or maybe she was too aware of what was happening between nance and me. but they leave... and all that worrying doesn't amount to a hill of crap. it's just wasted energy.}
<A>__{calvin is troubled.}
