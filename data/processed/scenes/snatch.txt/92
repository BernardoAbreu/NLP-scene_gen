<L>__{interior back room porn brokers}
<A>__{vin, lincoln and sol are arguing}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{hold him by his legs.}
<C>__{ba d boy lincoln}
<D>__{what do you think i am holding him by, his fucking ears?}
<A>__{the interconnecting door opens slowly.}
<C>__{brick top}
<D>__{hope it ' s not a bad moment.}
<A>__{sol looks at vin, vin looks at lincoln: they are understandably surprised. brick top looks around the room the silence continues. brick top helps himself to the most comfortable seat.}
<C>__{brick top }
<D>__{do you know who i am?}
<C>__{bad boy lincoln}
<D>__{yeah i know.}
<C>__{brick top}
<D>__{good. that will save me some time then.}
<C>__{vinny}
<D>__{well i don't.}
<C>__{brick top}
<D>__{what you gonna do with your man there? you're always gonna have problems lifting a body in one piece. apparently the best thing to do is cut the corpse up into six pieces and pile it all together.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{would someone mind telling me who you are?}
<C>__{brick top}
<D>__{after you got six pieces you gotta get rid of 'em, of course you can't just leave it in the deep freeze for your mum to discover, can ya?}
<A>__{pause while the black guys are still holding the body. the door opens and in walks errol. he passes brick top a cup of tea in a take away container.}
<C>__{vinny}
<D>__{lincoln, who is this man?}
<C>__{brick top}
<D>__{and then i hear the best thing to do is feed 'em to pigs. you gotta starve the pigs for a few days, then the sight of a chopped up body looks like curry to a drunk. you gotta shave the heads of your victims and pull the teeth out, you could do that after of course, but you don't want to go sieving pig shit do you? ever seen the size of one of their molars?}
<A>__{he holds up his fist}
<C>__{brick top }
<D>__{they go through bone like i t ' s butter. you gotta have a few pigs though you need about sixteen they will go through a body that weighs two hundred pounds in about eight minutes that means that a single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh every minute,.}
<A>__{pause}
<C>__{brick top }
<D>__{hence the expression greedy as a pig.}
<A>__{pause}
<C>__{vinny}
<D>__{well thank you, that's a large weight off my mind.}
<C>__{vinny }
<D>__{but would you mind very much telling me who the' fuck you are? other than a man that feeds people to pigs of course.}
<A>__{the door opens and we see john, who is wearing a pair of extremely large plastic gloves, showing brick top the shotgu that he has found.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{would you look at the size of this?}
<C>__{brick top}
<D>__{golly that is big isn't it errol?}
<A>__{he looks back at the brothers}
<C>__{brick top }
<D>__{do you know what nemesis means?}
<A>__{there is a pause}
<C>__{brick top }
<D>__{a righteous infliction of retribution by. an appropriate agent, personified in this case by a horrible cunt. me.}
<A>__{brick top stands and opens the door. we can see that a coupl of ropes have been slung over the rafters and a couple of buckets are underneath them. six very large men (including errol and john) are standing around wanting to get busy. tyrone is with them, all trussed up.}
