<D>__{i'm her father supposed to be, but i'm not able to. yes. yes, i am. it may be the only thing in my life i've been so clear about wanting. even if it takes a big fight.}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{then... i guess you have to.}
<C>__{wade}
<P>__{(silence)}
<D>__{there's another thing i've been thinking about. i don't know how you feel about the idea, margie, because we've never talked about it. but i've been thinking lately, i've been thinking we should get married sometime. you and me.}

<C>__{margie}
<D>__{you've been married twice }
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{it was to the same woman. i was just a kid...}
<P>__{(marg looks)}
<D>__{it's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. something for you and me to talk about and think about. you know?}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{alright. i will think about it.}
