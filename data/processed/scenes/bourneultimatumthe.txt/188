<A>__{desh is disappearing from view. and the policemen are surrounding bourne. demanding to see his papers. bourne speaking in spanish fishing for his papers. looking back up the street. forming a plan. checking his watch. more police arriving now. and desh has disappeared out of sight. no time for this. bourne breaks away. through the crowds into the traffic. police whistles shouting. confusion. the chase is on. three policemen turning into his path. no choice. bourne taking them down. sprinting out across the road. a kid and his moped. caught up in the police dragnet. bourne leaping on the bike kick starting it. away into traffic as two squad cars turn and make chase. bourne weaving through traffic. one hand on the bike the other on the cell, desperately trying to call nicky. but now, at least he's got a dial tone.}
