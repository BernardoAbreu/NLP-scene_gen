<L>__{interior living room, later that night}
<A>__{the candles have burned down, casting a romantic glow throughout the apartment. louis armstrong's "what a wonderful world" plays. kate and leopold sit on the couch sipping wine.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{tell me more.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{um, where was i? so after my father died i had to go to work.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{have you had many jobs?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{many. i got fired from all of them. i'm the most unskilled person i know. but they were just survival jobs while i was still in school. i always knew i wanted to go into science like my father. and i did.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{do you miss him?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i think about him every day. he was courtly, just like you.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i think you are a remarkable woman katherine coles.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{you just don't get out much. you'd be surprised how remarkable i'm not.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{no, it is you who would be surprised.}
<A>__{they kiss. anxiously they stare into each other's eyes. they kiss again. slowly, kate leads him to her bedroom door. they look at each other, deciding. deliberately, cautiously, kate opens the door.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{kate...}
<A>__{kate puts her fingers over leopold's lips. gently she leads him inside. they slowly embrace as the door closes.}
