<A>__{traffic is snarled. horns are blasting. tempers are frayed. close on a hammering jackhammer... camera widens to reveal that it is being operated by the shoveler, dressed in work clothes. wiped out from the night before, the vibrations of the hamer are lulling him off to sleep... he nods out... as his boss whacks him on the arm.}
