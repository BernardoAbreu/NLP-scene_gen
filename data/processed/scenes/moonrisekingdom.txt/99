<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{sam and suzy sitting on a tree branch over the water eating raisins from sam's hand. suzy has flowers in her hair. she looks down into the water with her binoculars.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{why do you always use binoculars?}
<A>__{suzy thinks for minute. she says finally:}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{it helps me see things closer. even if they're not very far away. i pretend it's my magic power.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{that sounds like poetry. poems don't always have to rhyme, you know. they're just supposed to be creative.}
<A>__{suzy gives sam the binoculars. he points them at her and stares.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what do you want to be? when you grow up.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{i don't know. i want to go on adventures, i think. not get stuck in one place. how about you?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{go on adventures, too. not get stuck, too. i guess that sounds almost like i'm just repeating what you just said, but i couldn't think of anything as good as it. on the other hand, maybe we'll get blown up by an atom bomb. you can't predict the exact future.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{that's true.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's possible i may wet the bed, by the way. later, i mean.}
<C>__{suzy}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{ok.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}
<D>__{i wish i didn't have to mention it, but just in case. i don't want to make you be offended.}
<C>__{suzy}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{of course, i won't.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{some people frown on these problems.}
<A>__{suzy nods. she holds sam's hand. she points to the scorpion brooch pinned to sam's shirt.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{what's that one for?}
<A>__{sam looks at the brooch. he shakes his head.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's not an accomplishment. i inherited it from my mother. it's actually not meant for a male to wear but i don't give a damn.}
<A>__{suzy nods thoughtfully. pause.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{are your foster parents still mad at you? for getting in trouble so much.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i don't think so. we're getting to know each other better. i feel like i'm in a family now. not like yours, but similar to one.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{i always wished i was an orphan. most of my favorite characters are. i think your lives are more special.}
<A>__{sam frowns. tears suddenly well up in his eyes. he shakes his head.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i love you, but you don't know what you're talking about.}
<A>__{long pause. suzy says genuinely:}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{i love you, too.}
