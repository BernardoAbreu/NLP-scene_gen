<A>__{the three cyclists pause at the cave opening, sizing up possible avenues of escape in the terrain below.}

<P>__{(shakes head)}
<D>__{no good...they might block off the old chip.}
<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{this way.}
<A>__{the cycles race out of the cave entrance and head down, away from the approaching tanks, through the electronic canyons, shells exploding around them. we see the tanks close behind.}
<B>__{pov of a gun sight}
<A>__{from inside of the tanks, of the three bikes heading into a narrow arroyo.}
<B>__{shot of the cycles}
<A>__{they just make it around the corner when an explosion boasts the entrance to the arroyo, entering what appears to be a maze of very narrow canyons with short walls. they turn another corner and come to the edge of a gaping ravine. several hundred feet to their left a narrow bridge connects their ledge with another canyon wall, and a wider ledge, which leads down to the floor of the entire area, and on to freedom.}
<C>__{tron's voice}
<D>__{the bridge! come on!}
<A>__{the tanks are following through the maze, smooth gray automatons, lifeless, inexorable nemesis. tron's cycle is in the lead as all three race for the bridge, but behind them, we see the first tank turning the corner.}
