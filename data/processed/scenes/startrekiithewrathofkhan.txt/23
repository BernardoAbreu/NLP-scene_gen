<L>__{interior enterprise engine room looking down}
<A>__{the inspection party dwarfed by the size. silence as kirk looks around, runs a finger for dust, etc. scotty, his team and preston, stand at attention. angle floor of engine room featuring power room separated by glass from the rest of the facilities. bones, sulu, uhura, and some train ees watch as kirk inspects one console, clearly the responsibility of the bursting midshipman preston.}
<C>__{preston}
<P>__{(blurting)}
<D>__{i believe you'll find everything shipshape, admiral.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(sternly puts him on)}
<D>__{oh do you? have you any idea, midshipman preston, how many times i've had to listen to mr. scott on the comm, telling me his troubles? have you any idea the ribbing i've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the enterprise is a flying death trap?}
<C>__{preston}
<P>__{(scandalized)}
<D>__{oh, no, sir! this is the finest engine room in the whole star }
<A>__{the repressed grins of the others, and a smile on scotty's face tell preston he's being had. he stops, confused.}
<C>__{preston}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{if the admiral can't see the facts for himself, then, with all due respect, he's as blind as a tiberion bat. sir.}
<A>__{approving laughter. kirk looks amused.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{midshipman, you're a tiger.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{my sister's youngest, admiral. crazy to get to space.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{every young boy's fancy. i seem to remember it myself.}
<P>__{(brisk)}
<D>__{very well. mr. scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{give the word, admiral.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{mr. scott, the word is given.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{aye, sir.}
<A>__{he moves off, followed by preston, who gives one last salute as kirk leaves, followed by bones.}
<C>__{bones}
<P>__{(dry)}
<D>__{what about the rest of the inspection, admiral?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{the inspection will continue once we're underway, doctor.}
<A>__{they step into the turbo lifts.}
