<D>__{james. listen. things things are a little weird with me right now and i well i have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. and if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. that's why i need you to go home. understand?}
<C>__{james leer}

<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i swear. my father had his own airplane he used to fly up to quebec. one christmas, he and my mom were flying up to our house in the laurentians when the plane went down. it was in the newspaper.}
<A>__{grady doesn't flinch, unpersuaded.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i 'swear. my father was a senior vice president at dravo. my mother was a socialite. her maiden name was guggenheim.}
<A>__{grady starts to protest, then pauses.}
<C>__{grady}

<D>__{james, come on. that man is obviously your father. you look just like him.}
<A>__{james looks down at the table, takes a deep breath, and speaks in a voice heavy with implication.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{there's a reason for that.}
<A>__{grady's addled brain grapples with this dark little riddle, finally deciphers what james is suggesting.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{get out of here.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{that's why she hates me. that's why she makes me sleep in the basement.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{in the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of amontillado. come on. up.}
<A>__{as grady lifts him from the booth, james attempts a plaintive tone, but his heart's not in it.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i swear.}
