<L>__{interior soda shop. night.}
<A>__{the rain still pounds out the window. betty and mr. johnson are huddled in one of the booths watching the deluge through mr. johnson's snow scene in the window. betty is in soft radiant color now. almost the whole frame seems to glow pink ...}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{you can't go out there.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{but i really should get home.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{but you can't go out there.}
<A>__{there is another fork of lightning and a booming peel of thunder. betty sighs. she's past struggling. betty shuts her eyes for a moment and listens to the rain pounding on the roof.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{sounds nice ... once you get used to it.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<P>__{(listening)}
<D>__{yeah. it does.}
<A>__{there is another flash and a loud boom. betty smiles this time.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{like a drum.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{or like sprinklers in the summer ...}
<A>__{betty smiles. they both listen for a moment and the fear seems to fade a little. the rain pounds harder on the roof as betty nestles down in the booth, a little closer to mr. johnson. they just sit there listening for a moment or two. betty starts to smile ...}
