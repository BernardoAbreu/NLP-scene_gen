<L>__{interior apartment night}
<A>__{a large, stylishly decorated apartment in manhattan. a tremendous living room. a party's going on. very loud jazz is playing. the lights are dim. there are about 30 guests. lots of young pretty women. gourmet buffet. people are sitting on couches talking, others are eating, drinking or dancing. in a dimly lit corner, jack is kneeling before a girl sitting in an armchair. she is laughing as she listens to him.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(whispering passionately)}
<D>__{this is no line and i'm not trying to get you into bed. this is something completely different. this is 'love at first sight.' oh, i'm so happy... let me go get you a glass of champagne. i will be right back.}
<A>__{jack gets up and goes over to the buffet. as soon as he's out of the girl's line of sight, he starts running toward the other end of the apartment. on the way he passes michael, who's deeply engrossed in a vehement conversation about modern art with a girl called sophia. they're fighting like cats and dogs but seem to be enjoy ing it.}
<C>__{sophia}
<D>__{are you saying that's art, are you really saying that's art? well then you explain why.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it goes back to prehistoric man. they had comic strips on their walls, for god's sake.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(whispering}
<D>__{in michael's}
<P>__{ear)}

<A>__{he moves away towards the den.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(to sophia)}
<D>__{wait one second for me, i will be right back.}
<A>__{michael walks off in the direction of rosalie. paul is wandering among the guests, trying to find jack, he sees peter who is talking with another young woman, nicole. peter is nodding, idly looking around, com pletely uninterested in the conversation.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{you guys have a beautiful place here. but the rent must be a killer.}
<A>__{peter isn't paying attention.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{isn't it a killer?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what?...}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{oh, the rent... yeah, it's high but split between the three of us it isn't that bad, as long as we don't eat.}
<A>__{nicole laughs.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hi peter, i'm looking for jack, have you seen him?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh hi, paul, how are you doing? yeah, sure, i will take you to jack.}
<P>__{(to nicole)}
<D>__{excuse me for a minute.}
<A>__{they move away.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you're a lifesaver, i've been trying to get away from that woman for 20 minutes. that sonofabitch carl is moving in on my natalie. gotta go... bye.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{wait what about jack?}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(in a hurry)}
<D>__{he's around somewhere. check under all the couches.}
<A>__{paul walks off in jack's direction. we stay with peter, who reaches natalie. she is talking with a very styl ishly dressed, tall, young man, carl.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh natalie, i've been looking for you all night.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{all night? i just saw you deep in conversation with nicole!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{deep? hell no, we were just talking shop.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{oh come on peter, we all know what a ladies' man you are.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{who, me? jack's the ladies' man, not me. you're the only lady i'm after.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{so tell me, how's your project coming along? i heard you're not ready yet.}
<C>__{peter}

<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(in a bad mood)}
<D>__{ours is incredible too.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{if you ever get it finished.}
<A>__{paul comes up to jack, who is kneeling before clementine, whispering passionate sweet nothings in her ear. it appears he's gotten beyond the "this is love at first sight" stage. he's getting down to the nitty gritty now. clementine is thrilled. paul taps jack on the shoulder.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{jack, can i talk to you for a second?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, hi, paul, yeah sure...}
<C>__{jack }
<P>__{(to clementine)}
<D>__{... please darling, don't move... i will be right back, okay? i will bring us back some champagne...}
<A>__{he disappears with paul.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're a lifesaver, paul. i thought i'd never get away. rosalie's waiting for me in the living room. isn't she terrific?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{who? rosalie?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{clementine.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{oh yeah, for sure, i dunno. listen, can you do me a favor?}
<A>__{with some difficulty, paul follows jack as he picks his way through the people dancing, heading in rosalie's direction.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah... what kind of favor? damn, i've got to get her a glass of champagne.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{listen, i've got a little problem. i'm having a valuable package delivered to me on sunday, but i'm not going to be home. i've got to do the hawaii tahiti australia route, so can i have the package delivered here instead?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(filling a glass with champagne)}
<D>__{yeah, sure, of course.}
<P>__{(he stops, thinking)}
<D>__{no, wait, i'm leaving for south america tomorrow. i will be gone for three weeks.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{but it's okay. peter and michael will be here. they'll take care of it.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{will you be sure to tell them about it?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{absolutely. don't worry about a thing.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it'll be delivered sunday and picked up next thursday, okay?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{delivered sunday picked up thursday. got it. no problem.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{this is a very delicate matter, jack. it's very important they don't tell anybody about this package. it could be very... uh, embarrassing for me, you know what i'm saying?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sure. you got it. i will see you later...}
<A>__{jack is about to rejoin rosalie. paul grabs his arm.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{not to anyone at all. tell them that, okay?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{okay, sure, not to anyone at all... look, i'm sorry paul, but i gotta get back to rosalie. now go have a good time. i will take care of everything.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{bye and thanks a lot.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't mention it.}
<A>__{paul leaves. jack finally reaches the armchair where rosalie is sitting. he stops short, obviously disappointed.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{uh oh. too late.}
<A>__{michael is sitting next to rosalie, right next to her. they get up to dance. as he passes jack, michael smiles broadly.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{all's fair, old buddy...}
<A>__{jack watches a moment, then breaks into a wide smile.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling clementine.}
<A>__{jack whirls around and heads back towards clementine.}
