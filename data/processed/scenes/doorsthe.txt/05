<L>__{interior car day}
<A>__{mom, dad, the youngest baby in the front seat pointing at the storm. grandma & grandad in the back with jim, about 4 and his sister, 3 asleep. mom's a beauty and dad's an austere handsome military man in civilian clothes, mouthing words look, wake them up, a desert storm... but we barely hear a lightning bolt shreds the blue sky with a thunderous sound, frightening dawn of creation... grandma nudging jim awake. his eyes open just as the car turns the bend revealing an overturned truck lying in the road dead and wounded indians everywhere... a cop car, ambulance. a terrible accident... the first thing jim sees... an old indian face staring at him... the car pulling alongside, dad rolling his window down... asking if he can help (soundless) a line of wailing indian women, children mom's scared face...}
<C>__{jim voice}
<D>__{...but it was the first time i tasted fear. i musta been about four, like a child is just like a flower, his head is floating in the breeze.}
<A>__{grandma trying to hide jim's face but he looks back...}
<B>__{the cop waving them through}
<A>__{the kid looking back through the rear window, terrified his first view of death. the bodies, the sense of doom overlaying the land a child's worst nightmare.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{it's just a dream, jimmy, just a dream}
<B>__{song}
<A>__{(continues) there's a killer on the road his brain is squirming like a toad take a long holiday let your children play if you give this man a ride sweet family will die there's a killer on the road the boy's eyes going back to the indian man looking at him... then to the dying opened body bleeding out its guts on the asphalt... the dying man's face, twisted, moaning, amazing eyes at the point of death they settle on jim}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{it's just a dream jimmy, just a dream}
<A>__{a strange sound occurs the rattle of an ancient gourd, "shi chi chi, shi chi chi". something flying through the air. a bull roarer, a whirling leather thong, announcing the appearance of a shaman.}
