<L>__{interior 7 11 night}
<A>__{martin walks into the store, looking around once again at his old home. to the left of the door, a typical suburban teenage skateboarder is lost in the "mortal combat" video game and something too loud from his walkman. carl, still working the double, nods to martin.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{what's done is done.}
<A>__{martin moves up one aisle to the gum rack. he picks out a pack of beaman's and unwraps a stick as he heads to the counter. on the way, he makes a black town car pulling into a spot next to his own. he immediately changes course, and bee lines for a rear aisle where he ducks down...}
<B>__{felix}
<A>__{comes through the door, drawing a mac 10 for each hand.}
<B>__{martin}
<A>__{grabs the gum out of his mouth and sticks it onto the bottom of the glock .9mm he has produced from somewhere in his suit.}
<B>__{carl}
<A>__{grabs the cash drawer, sets it on the counter, and puts his hands up.}
<B>__{the skateboarder}
<A>__{plays on.}
<B>__{felix and carl}
<A>__{felix shoots carl dead on his way toward}
<B>__{martin}
<A>__{bolts up the cooler aisle. bursts of fire follow him, taking out each freezer door behind him.}
<B>__{martin and felix}
<A>__{exchange fire john woo style between the aisles of the cramped store. felix delivers a close to home burst as he jumps the counter, sending martin diving out of view.}
<B>__{martin}
<A>__{pinned behind the slurpee machine, pauses to reload his now two glock nines. martin steals a glance to get a bead on felix and is met with a salvo that rocks the slurpee machine, spattering him with several flavors... and that's all he can take. martin comes up blasting with both guns, but all that's left of felix is swinging doors and squealing tires. martin moves to the cashier island, low to the ground.}
<B>__{the skateboarder}
<A>__{twitches and jerks, still absorbed in his game and oblivious to the surrounding carnage.}
<B>__{cashier island}
<A>__{martin crawls through the waist level swinging door and moves to carl.}
<B>__{carl}
<A>__{is really dead. martin rolls him over to check it out and finds}
<B>__{a bomb}
<A>__{under the corpse.}
<B>__{martin}
<A>__{flips the corpse back on top of the device and leaps the counter toward the doors. he grabs the shoulder or the skateboarder, who shrugs him off, annoyed }
<C>__{skateboarder}
<D>__{what the fuck, man?!}
<A>__{the video game screen explodes. shot full of martin's bullets. the skateboarder reacts backward and martin jerks him out of the double doors.}
