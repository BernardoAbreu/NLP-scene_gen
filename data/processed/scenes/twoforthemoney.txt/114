<L>__{interior walter's office night}
<A>__{all but one tv is dark. the last game ends and a remote control suddenly shatters the screen. walter paces the office. brandon still on the sofa. no one else in the room. a wall clock reads}
<L>__{12:19 am. walter picks up brandon's betting sheet, holds it}
<A>__{like a dead fish.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{... how do you go 3 and 11? wanna know how you make sunday's picks on tuesday! it rained in cincinatti! two starting qbs didn't play! you're a handicapper, not a psychic!}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{there's still monday night and the parlay.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{fuck monday night! fuck the parlay! you were pissed at me, right? the commission thing?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{you fucked with me, right? joke's on me, right? the money thing. okay, i think we're on dangerous ground here but i'm giving you a bump, 10 percent. now what about monday night's game? you want to look over that pick? because everyone's gonna double down to climb out of the fucking hole you put 'em in.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{monday night's fine.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{you'd bet your mother's house on it?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{i don't bet.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{if you did?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{i like the pick, walter.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{on your mother's house or not?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{with my mother in it.}
