<L>__{404. as he crosses the desk, the phone rings. he looks at}
<A>__{the board and see room 716's light blinking. he sighs in exasperation.}
<L>__{interior room}
<A>__{sarah sees juancho shaking the champagne bottle violently.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{don't shake it!}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{ted? hi. it's me. sarah.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yeah. who died? no one? then don't call me.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i thought i'd tell you that your cleaning ladies are doing a bum job. there's all kinds of leftover stuff around here.}
<A>__{sarah picks up the needle and rolls it over in her hand several times.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{needles and things. we're not supposed to have needles here, are we? i mean, they don't come with the room, do they? send someone up here to clean this place up right.}
<A>__{the champagne bottle explodes all over juancho. he looks surprised.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(to juancho)}
<D>__{i told you not to shake it!}
<P>__{(to ted)}
<D>__{i gotta go. my brother just exploded the champagne all over the room. oh, and bring us a couple of toothbrushes. there's a card in the bathroom that says you'll bring free toothbrushes if we ask for them.}
<A>__{she hangs up. a frustrated ted hangs up the phone. he walks briskly to the elevator. sarah and juancho are pouring themselves champagne. they turn up the television and drink. juancho shudders at the taste, but tries to drink as much as sarah. sarah clearly doesn't like it, but tries to pretend she does. sarah picks up an instruction card near the phone to see how to make room to room calls.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i'm calling another room, give me three numbers.}
<C>__{juancho}
<D>__{4 0 9.}
<A>__{sarah punches in the room number. the phone rings. she holds the needle up to the light to examine it.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{hello? hi. you don't know me, and i don't know you, but... do you have any needles? we've got needles here and i was wondering if they come with the room or not. don't have any? thanks. just checking.}
<A>__{she hangs up. juancho puts down his champagne glass and searches his father's coat pocket. he finds a pack of cigarettes and takes one out. he puts it in his mouth and pretends to smoke. sarah checks out the hypodermic needle carefully. she has an idea.}
