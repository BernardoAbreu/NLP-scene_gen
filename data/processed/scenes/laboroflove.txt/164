<D>__{yes i understand, it does sound humorous, but this is a very serious situation.}
<A>__{gerald is cooking. he gently flips the chicken breast in a butter and garlic sauce.}
<C>__{gerald}
<D>__{this smells good.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{why am i such an authority?}
<C>__{gerald}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{here comes the resume.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{i received my b.s. from the university of pennsylvania, my p.h.d. from bryn mawr college. i worked three years at the boston university school of medicine, during which time i had articles printed in the "journal of educational psychology", "american journal of psychology", "psychology review" and "science"... so i think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.}
<A>__{gerald brings the sizzling pan over and divides the steaming dish into both plates.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{look, please find him for me... officer, i tried... but i brought back the wrong person.}
<A>__{gerald quickly scoops some rice onto both plates. his mouth is watering as he goes for the utensils. adelle abruptly stands at her place.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{stop laughing!}
<A>__{gerald gets into his seat at the table just in time to see adelle angrily hang up the phone. she stares off into space before unconsciously cleaning the table. adelle picks up both plates of food...}
<C>__{gerald}
<D>__{adelle }
<A>__{gerald's heart sinks as adelle pops open the trash can with a tap of her foot and dumps the picture perfect meal into the garbage. she goes to the sink and rinses the plates completely preoccupied with her thoughts. she mumbles to herself as she shuts off the water.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{he says he admires him.}
<A>__{adelle storms out of the kitchen. gerald sits at the empty table with a fork in his hands. he shakes his head in disbelief.}
