<L>__{55 angle on eli and cameron}
<A>__{eli squats down on his heels and leans back against a piling, smiling up at cameron.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{speaking of jail...would you get upset if i asked how many cops were after you?}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(suddenly grim)}
<D>__{what are ya talkin' about?}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(off hand)}
<D>__{your i.d. bracelet...the look on your face...the way you ran from the bridge...}
<P>__{(with exaggerated delicacy)}
<D>__{i...don't suppose you want to tell me what you did.}
<A>__{cameron studies eli, not knowing what to make of him.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{no...i don't.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(brightly, with humor)}
<D>__{...could i try categories?}
<A>__{cameron half laughs despite himself.}
<C>__{eli }
<P>__{(glancing o.s.)}
<D>__{ever done any stunt work?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{how'd you like to be a stunt man? you look like you're in pretty good shape, fast on your feet. you could do it.}
<P>__{(getting to his feet)}
<D>__{besides, you're not gonna have much choice.}
<B>__{wider angle}
<A>__{jake has spotted them and is approaching with his men and the production manager. eli puts his hand on cameron's shoulder and steps out into the sunlight.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(softly, to cameron)}
<D>__{now, don't get hasty. and, remember your ass, it's just like mine... maybe i can save them both.}
<C>__{production manager}
<P>__{(trailing after jake)}
<D>__{...but we've gotta have three days to finish this picture...}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(striding toward eli)}
<D>__{you said you'd be gone four days ago, before the season started. you lie, break promises...}
<P>__{(he is now close enough and shouting at eli)}
<D>__{cross, i've gone out of my way, but this time...}
<A>__{a tram beeps, clangs and passes between them, interrupting jake and leaving him sputtering. as it departs, eli seizes the moment.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{jake, it's been a rotten morning. you're hot and tired. let's go in, have us a drink and find out what's eating you.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(turning beet red)}
<D>__{don't treat me like these other morons! you know goddamn well what's eating me is that duesenberg on the bottom of the river with the dead man in it!}
<A>__{there is silence. eli stands thoughtfully kicking the sand with his toe. then jake starts shouting again.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{i mean, that is a goddamn public bridge and a public river! you go there without permits, without any precautions and get a man killed!}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{jake...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{no more bullshit explanations. just go...before i figure out how to hang you with a manslaughter charge!}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(after a pause; quietly)}
<D>__{no explanations...don't have any. but, maybe he does...}
<P>__{(staring at cameron)}
<D>__{go ahead, ask him, jake.}
<A>__{eli's words are exploding in cameron's mind that illusory event on the bridge has crystallized into hard reality.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(wide eyed)}
<D>__{...now wait!...you're not blaming me for...}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(wheeling on cameron)}
<D>__{why not, burt?! because you're a fake?! because you're just a goddamn daredevil with a head full of marbles?!}
<A>__{cameron vaguely understands that eli is trying to pass him off as burt and that he, somehow, may be saved by going along with this madness. eli, turning to jake, continues passionately...}
<C>__{eli }
<D>__{he grabs the bread, blows the shot, screws you up...screws me up. he's dumb, jake, but thank god, he ain't dead yet. so do me a favor, put your handcuffs on this son of a bitch and put him some place where he can't get hurt!}
<A>__{the chief is dazed. if this is burt, the stunt man, he is obviously alive. jake goes to cameron.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{how did you get out of the car?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{he didn't get out. our divers got him out...and brought him back in the chopper.}
<A>__{the chief stares at cameron. his clothes and hair are wet. there is a small bruise on his cheek from when he fell out of the duesenberg. he looks the part. jake turns to eli with resignation.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{cross, when these three days are up, i'm going to arm my men with shotguns and tell them it's open season on any fruit carrying a camera.}
<A>__{he walks to the waiting police car, surrounded by tourists snapping pictures. he glares at them, angry at the world. eli puts his arm on cameron's shoulder and leads him through the dispersing crowd toward the hotel. eli is now easygoing and friendly.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you did that very well.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{i didn't get a chance to say a word. i just listened.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{there are only a few actors in the world who have mastered that art. anyway, it was a good audition. you landed the part.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{how? what about the crew? they going to look at me and say, 'hi, burt?'}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{unless you prefer, 'hi, elizabeth.' don't worry about my crew, they'll call you anything i want 'em to. look, i'm not being callous. burt is a fucking tragedy, but there's nothing in the world i can do about it...i've gotta have this location for three more days...and you need a place to hide.}
<A>__{they have reached the steps of the hotel. a bus has stopped in front. tourists are piling out. the police car pulls up and parks nearby. jake and his men can be seen surveying the crowd.}
<C>__{a.d.}
<P>__{(shouting in b.g.)}
<D>__{eli! the crew's waiting. we need the next setup!}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{the hand! close up of the hand! be there in a minute!}
<C>__{a.d.}
<D>__{an eli minute or a real minute?!}
<A>__{eli turns back to cameron as they mount the steps.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{by tomorrow the local cops'll know what i look like. i can't hang around.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(expansively)}
<D>__{"burt," stop worrying! haven't you heard of "movie magic?"}
<P>__{(pointing to the etched glass doors of the hotel)}
<D>__{that door is "the looking glass," and inside...is wonderland. you're gonna pose as a stunt man, who's posing as an actor, who's posing as a character in a movie...who's posing as an enemy soldier...in that big a crowd, who's gonna notice you? people like to believe in things and cops are just people.}
<A>__{the have reached the front door. eli holds it open for cameron.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(with mock confidentiality)}
<D>__{frankly, your problem's so simple, it's almost beneath me. have faith, 'alice.' close your eyes and enjoy.}
<A>__{in exhaustion and resignation, cameron nods and wearily closes his eyes.}
<B>__{screen goes black}
<C>__{denise's voice}
<D>__{open your eyes...and don't touch. it's wet.}
