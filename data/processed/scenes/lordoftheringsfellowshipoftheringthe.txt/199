<L>__{exterior elrond's chamber, rivendell day}
<A>__{gandalf and elrond watch frodo and sam from elrond's balcony,}
<C>__{elrond}
<D>__{his strength returns.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{that wound will never fully heal. he will carry it the rest of his life.}
<C>__{elrond}
<D>__{and yet to have come so far still bearing the ring...the hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{it is a burden he should never have to had to bear. we can ask no more of frodo.}
<C>__{elrond}
<D>__{gandalf, the enemy is moving. sauron's forces are massing in the east. his eye is fixed on rivendell. and saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us. our list of allies grows thin.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{his treachery runs deeper than you know. by foul craft, saruman has crossed orc with goblin men...he is breeding an army in the caverns of isengard. an army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed. saruman is coming for the ring.}
<A>__{elrond turns and walks away...}
<C>__{elrond}
<D>__{this evil cannot be concealed by the power of the elves...we do not have the strength to fight both mordor and isengard...gandalf...the ring cannot stay here.}
<A>__{gandalf turns and looks out the window. sounds of arrivals...gandalf watches as boromir rides through rivendell gate, followed by legolas and gimli.}
<D>__{elrond (v.o.) (cont'd) this peril belongs to all middle earth. they must decide how to end it. not just for themselves but for those who come after. elrond approaches gandalf.}
<C>__{elrond }
<D>__{the time of the elves is over. my people are leaving these shores. who will you look to when we have gone? the dwarves? they hide in their mountains seeking riches. they care nothing for the troubles of others.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{it is in men that we must place our hope.}
<C>__{elrond}
<D>__{men? men are weak. the race of men is failing. the blood of numenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten. it is because of men the ring survives.}
<A>__{flash insert: with the broken sword, isildur slices off sauron's finger. elrond reacts.}
<D>__{elrond (v.o.) (cont'd) i was there, gandalf...i was there three thousand years ago when isildur took the ring.}
<A>__{flash insert: isildur picks up the ring and stares at it,}
<B>__{entranced.}
<C>__{elrond}
<D>__{i was there the day the strength of men failed.}
