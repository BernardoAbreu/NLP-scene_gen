<A>__{rose stares at marshall. her look is hard to read. distant... cold, perhaps.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{can my husband sit next to me?}
<A>__{korshunov considers the pair. hands taped behind their back. they're harmless. korshunov nods. marshall rises and joins her on the pilot's rest bunk.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i don't know why you stayed.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{please... don't start with me.}
<A>__{rose moves closer to him, and speaks in a low voice.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{there's something i need to tell you... and god knows if i will ever get another chance.}
<A>__{from behind, we see her push his taped hands away. he looks at her quizically.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{no matter what happens, you have been and always will be my hero.}
<A>__{he feels the wall behind him. a dull edge of metal twisted slightly from the earlier cockpit door explosion. he understands.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{and you have always been my guardian angel.}
<A>__{she smiles back at him.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i will never regret my life with you.}
<A>__{behind marshall's back, he begins to cut away at the duct tape.}
