<L>__{exterior julie's backyard night}
<A>__{now we understand. julie's family comes from major bucks. the yard is massive. and resting in a sprawling oak tree is the best hiding place in the world.}
<L>__{interior julie's tree house night}
<A>__{a cozy oasis. books everywhere. a whole series of flashlights hang upside down like lanterns. giving the tree house a warm glow.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i can't believe your dad built this for you.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{he didn't. he had it built.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{whatever.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{not "whatever." it's two different things.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{he cared enough to want you to have it.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{he phoned it in.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i doubt it.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{now it makes sense, the whole neo bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. you're a poor little rich girl.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{the ozone must be fully depleted on planet ted.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you think my dad would have been like that if i knew him? you think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{your dad taught you everything.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i mean my father.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{a father is nothing but sperm, ted. it takes a real man to be a dad.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{it's all so complicated.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{it's incredibly simple.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i feel like i'm being drawn and quartered. like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{eventually you'll let go.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{and then what?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{then you'll see who's really holding on to you.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you're amazing.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{even when you infuriate me, i still want to kiss you.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{but you never do.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{if we were a team, we could do anything. i mean, anything.}
<A>__{julie's eyes narrow. she should have known.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{cut to the chase, william randolph. your audience is way ahead of you.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{in a word: merk. exposed.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{that's two words. and i'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? i need to graduate. besides, merk's a boy scout.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{there's gotta be something. we have to dig deeper.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{you forget, i dislike you at least as much as him.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{he shut down your paper! you're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and pta brunches!}
<A>__{he's right, but...}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{a good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. i'm honing my craft.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...}
<A>__{julie groans.}
