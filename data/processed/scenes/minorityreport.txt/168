<A>__{dr. resfield looks up as witwer strides into the lab, carrying a tv under his arm. witwer is the last person he wants to see.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{borrowed this from the technicians' lounge. you don't think they'll mind, do you?}
<C>__{dr.resfield}
<D>__{you shouldn't be here, director.}
<A>__{dr. resfield's eyes cut to a large digital clock on the wall, the red numbers ticking off time in seconds. witwer looks for a plug, finds one. plugs in the tv.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{no, no. this is exactly where i should be.}
<C>__{dr. resfield}
<D>__{you're under a lot of strain, director.}
<A>__{witwer finds what he's looking for the continuous loop of his murder by anderson. "call now! call now!"}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{and tv's so good for that soothes the mind.}
<A>__{witwer turns his sweaty face to resfield and gives him a bright smile. the scientist looks like he wants to run out of the room. witwer takes him by the elbow and guides him toward the precogs. two technicians hover over the precogs adjusting iv's and turning dials on the precogs's organic helmets. the precogs wince and shiver with each turn of the dial. but they are no longer violently seizing they are too weak for that.}
<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{bring me up to speed, doc.}
<C>__{dr. resfield}
<D>__{we're getting nothing from them.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{and that's because ... ?}
<A>__{witwer still grips him by the elbow.}
<C>__{dr. resfield}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{do you think they know where anderson is?}
<C>__{dr. resfield}
<D>__{it's impossible to tell.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we've done everything. maybe even too much.}
<B>__{witwer stares at the precogs}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{they know how to find anderson for me.}
<C>__{witwer }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{they're the perfect machine, doctor. you just have to know which button to push.}
