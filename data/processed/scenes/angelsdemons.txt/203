<L>__{int pope's office night}
<A>__{ in the papal office, to watch the scene in person.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{the scientist kept journals? so?}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{you figure prominently in them.}
<A>__{the camerlengo turns his eyes back to the flames, stirring the embers with a poker.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{leonardo wasn't just a physicist, he was a catholic priest. deeply conflicted about the implications of his work and in need of spiritual guidance. about a month ago, he requested an audience with the pope. but you'd know that, because you granted the audience, and were present during it.}
<A>__{the camerlengo twists the poker in the fire. speaks softly.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{the fool thought he had duplicated the moment of creation.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{and the holy father urged him to go public. his holiness thought the discovery might actually prove the existence of a divine power begin to bridge the gap between religion and science.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{science. the new god. ignore the weapons and chaos and madness.}
<A>__{the camerlengo looks up at him, and his expression is different than we've ever seen it. contemptuous. angry. violent.}
<C>__{camerlengo }
<D>__{his work was not religious, it was sacrilegious!}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{but you saw the pope's position as a softening of church law. an old man's weakness. your father's weakness.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{he raised me to protect the church. even from within.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{so you brought an old enemy back from the dead to frighten people.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{nothing unites hearts like the presence of evil.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{it didn't work, father.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{it isn't finished.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{i've informed father simeon of what i learned and he'll get word to the cardinals the moment conclave opens.}
<A>__{the camerlengo looks at him calmly for a moment }
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{i was planning on doing this alone.}
<A>__{ and then removes the poker from the fire. but it isn't a poker, it's a long handled brand, with a cross of some kind at the end. rocher pulls his gun, holds it at his side.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{put that down.}
<A>__{the camerlengo rips open his cassock with his free hand.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{but perhaps it's better that you're here.}
<C>__{rocher}
<P>__{(raising the gun)}
<D>__{put it down!}
<A>__{but the camerlengo rams the red hot brand into the exposed flesh of his bare chest. his skin sizzles and smokes, rocher shouts, the camerlengo screams in agony, and we know the rest the door bursts open, swiss guard pour in, rocher is shot, father simeon races toward the camerlengo }
<C>__{fr. simeon}
<D>__{you bastard! you sanctimonious }
<A>__{ and the camerlengo rolls over, pointing one long finger at father simeon and crying out:}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{illuminatus!}
<A>__{as we saw before, lt. chartrand fires three times, killing father simeon in his tracks, we pull back, the image turns to }
