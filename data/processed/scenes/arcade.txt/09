<L>__{interior high school hallway day}
<A>__{alex moves quickly through the mass of students, wiping the remnants of half tears on her coat sleeve.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior high school cafeteria day}
<A>__{fun time. total chaos. if you've been to high school you know the riff. bad food, teen age melodrama, and a squadron of supervisors trying to keep a lid on things.}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{makes her way to the far corner of the cafeteria where a cluster of kids lounge around a table. these are alex's friends. and while none of them are your garden variety pocket protector type nerds, these kids aren't exactly part of the "in crowd". they're a little off. quirky. all of them come from screwed up families, and that's what bonds them. they are: greg holliston alex's boyfriend. hopeful artist (not bad, either) and kind of punk looking. greg and the others are big fans of thrift shop clothing. because they don't have the money, they improvise. nick drake greg's best friend and future computer pioneer. he's attractive and he's got an edge. a bit of a hot shot. genius in the making. benz and stilts inseparable. benz is flunking out of school and would like nothing better than to spend the rest of his life reading comic books. he's tall, perpetually unkempt, awkward, and nervous. stilts, contrary to his nickname, is quite short and never without his skateboard. stilts is constantly hitting on... laurie the sixth member of the group. a teen theda bara and as cynical as you can get. she's what's affectionately known as an "art chick". the boys in the group, particularly nick and stilts, are avid skateboarders and are frequently seen with their boards. stilts is always leafing through an issue of thrasher magazine. right now the group is in the midst of an argument. nick has a pocket video game in his hands which he casually plays. he can get through these games in his sleep. it beeps and whirs.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(to benz)}
<D>__{you're an idiot, you know that? what're you going to do when you get out of here?}
<C>__{benz}
<D>__{i was thinking about writing for one of those filipino mail order brides...}
<A>__{stilts and greg burst into laughter.}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{i think i saw that on the home shopping network. the girlfriend hour, right after auto accessories.}
<C>__{benz}
<P>__{(giggling)}
<D>__{exactly.}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{you guys are sick.}
<A>__{alex flops down in a chair and everyone turns.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{so how'd it go?}
<A>__{alex shrugs, trying to make light of it.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{he thinks i'm "sublimating".}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{what the hell does that mean?}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{it means she's screwed up.}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{fucked up. that's what they said i was.}
<C>__{benz}
<D>__{you are fucked up.}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{yeah, but only because i want to be.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{would you guys knock it off?}
<A>__{greg turns back to alex and looks her in the eye.}
<C>__{greg}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{listen to me, alex. these counselor's don't know anything. they're full of shit. if you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{so tell me you're okay, then.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i'm okay.}
<C>__{greg}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{good. cause i'd freak if you weren't.}
<A>__{greg leans over and kisses alex. the rest of the group launches into exaggerated groans, with benz and stilts fluttering their eyes and making "smooching faces" at each other. the kiss is over and everyone laughs. things are okay now.}
<C>__{greg}
<P>__{(to alex)}
<D>__{hey...watch this...}
<A>__{greg pulls an old polaroid camera from his backpack. he leans in close to her and holds the camera at arm's length, aiming it back at them. flash! and the moment's captured forever. greg pulls the polaroid out and peels off the backing. before the picture even develops, he begins rubbing his fingers over it, manipulating the emulsion.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(engrossed in his game again)}
<D>__{you making another one, greg?}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{sure. practice.}
<C>__{benz}
<D>__{lemme see...}
<A>__{greg pulls some papers from his backpack and slides them over to benz. the papers are color xeroxes of polaroid blow ups. greg has messed with them, creating swirling, psychedelic patterns with the images. stilts and laurie lean in.}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{cool.}
<C>__{greg}
<P>__{(still working)}
<D>__{see, when the emulsion's still warm you can move it around...}
<P>__{(stops)}
<D>__{there.}
<A>__{greg holds up the polaroid for alex to see.}
<B>__{polaroid}
<A>__{greg and alex are side by side, grinning...all around them the world has spun into strange colors. it's an odd effect. greg drops the photo in his shirt pocket and pats it.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{safe keeping.}
<A>__{meanwhile, nick's pocket video game emits an explosion noise.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{shit. i'm out.}
<A>__{he sets the game down, dejected.}
<C>__{benz}
<D>__{you guys going to dante's after school?}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{benz}
<D>__{check it out...}
<A>__{benz pulls a flyer from inside his coat. it's an ad for a new game called "arcade", featuring a pair of evil eyes and glowing hands coming out of a circuit board. the tag at the bottom reads, "coming this fall. reality will never be the same".}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{that's the new slip stream game. those guys are good. it's supposed to be interactive. graphics are unbelievable.}
<C>__{benz}
<D>__{yeah? they were handing these out at dante's. test marketing it or something. gonna have a demonstration today.}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{cool.}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{can you say anything but "cool"?}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{of course i can. i can say all sorts of things...}
<C>__{greg}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{guys...}
<A>__{benz pulls back the flyer and looks at it again.}
<C>__{benz}
<D>__{so how 'bout it?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i'm game...}
<P>__{(to greg)}
<D>__{greg?}
<A>__{greg turns to alex.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{come on. we'll hit dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{and then keep on driving?}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{sure. never come back. disappear forever.}
<C>__{laurie}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{i could go for that.}
<A>__{alex laughs. laurie took the words right out of her mouth.}
