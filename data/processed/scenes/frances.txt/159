<A>__{lillian is sitting on the couch, waiting. we hear a car pull up outside and stop. doors slam. steps come up the walk and onto the porch. the door opens and frances and ernest enter. lillian rises to face her daughter.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{do i go right away or do i have time to take a bath?}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{i was hoping for a kind word, little sister.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{you were hoping for a kind word?! you're my mother! you're supposed to nourish me! support me!}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{i have!}
<A>__{through the window we see a white van pull up outside.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{no! all you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! but i'm not you, mother, and i never will be, and thank god for it!}
<P>__{(to ernest)}
<D>__{that goes for you too! and frankly, i don't know how, with the two of you, i turned out as sane as i am }
<P>__{(to the men in white}
<D>__{coats who are at the}
<P>__{door)}
<D>__{wait right there, gentlemen, i will be with you in a minute... and believe me, i don't want to stay here one second longer than i have to!}
<P>__{(turning back)}
<D>__{but i've got to tell you, lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. in shame!}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{but what }
<P>__{(have i done?)}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{no! you're not talking now. you listen. you can send me away, lillian, you can pretend i'm crazy and pretend i'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore. you can't pretend i love you because i don't. i can't. not after what you've done to me. because you see... i'm still me... i'm trying real hard all this time to be me... and you, 'little sister', you haven't been any help at all.}
<P>__{(walking out the door)}
<D>__{okay, boys, i'm ready.}
<A>__{the way she goes out that door we know she's never coming back.}
