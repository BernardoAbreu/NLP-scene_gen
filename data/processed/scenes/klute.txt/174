<L>__{interior klute's apartment day}
<A>__{klute is packing to leave. we follow him about as he carries clothing from closet and bureau, folds it into his suitcase on the table. we hear the familiar footsteps on the stairs. bree's knock. he lets her in, keeps on about his business. his expression is sober; hers is quite tentative.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{he doesn't at least expel her. she ventures in, sits on the table, swings her heels, watches him pack. his arm impairs him. at length }
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{i got a call from ross this morning. cable owned a plot of woodland he'd go there on weekends. they found tom grunemann's body buried there. they've notified his wife.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{oh.}
<P>__{(pause; then sharply )}
<D>__{well it wasn't us city people that did it your fine rosy cheeked country boy.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{mm.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{you're going back?}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{mm.}
<A>__{pause. she compresses her lips, slips down from the table, starts smartly out of the room.}
<C>__{klute }
<D>__{wait.}
<A>__{she returns and sits on the table again, waits. but klute doesn't seem about to say anything more goes on packing.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{well suppose i hadn't come downstairs. would you just have folded up and sneaked away?}
<C>__{klute}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{no. i was going to come up. i wanted to ask you to marry me.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{you wanted to, or you are?}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{you could at least look at me!}
<A>__{he complies, stands and looks, folding a necktie. but now she finds she has to look away. somewhat brokenly }
<C>__{bree }
<D>__{look yes. i mean thanks, but don't you think we better be realistic?}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{look at me. i'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear god i'd tear your heart out!}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{he resumes packing, continues through the following.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{how can you not think so? you know the things i can do.}
<C>__{klute}
<P>__{(unclearly)}
<D>__{they don't scare me any more.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{doesn't scare me. i think we could handle it.}
<A>__{thereafter he guards his silence, staunchly goes on packing, as she comes at the thing from various sharp angles.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{please, i'm a city person. i'm sure it's just as good as here but i'm a city person, that's all, i am!}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{hell i know what it's like. i was in jersey once: the frogs go bra a p all night!}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what'im i supposed to do? mend your socks and sing in the church choir?}
<P>__{(pause, choking) )}
<D>__{do you not believe i love you? i'm honestly, honestly just }
<A>__{he has almost finished packing returns toward the suitcase with the tin clock and electric fan, tries to fit them in as conversation continues.}
<C>__{bree }
<D>__{look, why should it be yes or no? can't we keep it going and see? i mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. people do that, that's realistic.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{ok.}
<C>__{bree}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{you don't believe that either, do you? why can't you see my side?}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{can you use these?}
<A>__{he sets the fan beside her, hands her the loudly ticking clock. she holds it in her lap, numbly. he's packed closes various drawers, leaving in good order snaps the suitcase shut, lifts it stiffly down from the table. she remains sitting.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{can i carry something for you, to the car?}
<P>__{(he shakes his head)}
<D>__{will you kiss me?}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{no. i'm sore.}
<A>__{he moves to the door, pauses, half smiles }
<C>__{klute }
<D>__{well }
<A>__{she smiles back. he goes. we hear the entryway door opening and closing. she slips down off the table. we cut to : }
