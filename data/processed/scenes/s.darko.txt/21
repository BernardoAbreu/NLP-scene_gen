<A>__{each licking an ice cream cone, corey and sam walk past the home of father homeijer. the priest is outside working in his flower garden, wearing his clerical collar. an old catholic church rests on the same lot as his house, looming behind it. when father homeijer sees the girls walking by, he rises from his work, takes off his gloves and wipes sweat from his forehead. sam and corey both notice him eyeballing them.}
