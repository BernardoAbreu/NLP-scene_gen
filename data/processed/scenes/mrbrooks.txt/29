<L>__{interior conference room brooks box factory n day}
<A>__{the man from the reception area is nervously admiring a display of mr. brooks's ceramic pieces. he turns at the sound of the door opening behind.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{what can i do for you, mr...?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{... let's say, 'smith'.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{okay, mr. smith.}
<A>__{mr. brooks motions him to a seat.}
<C>__{mr. smith }
<P>__{(sitting)}
<D>__{before you get the wrong impression, mr. brooks, i'm not here to shake you down.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<P>__{(holding up the photos)}
<D>__{then these are the only copies of these photos and you have no others.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{no. i have other copies and other photos, and if something were to happen to me...}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{how did you find me, mr. smith?}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{you're 'man of the year', mr. brooks. your picture was in the paper. if it hadn't been, i don't know what i would have done.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{lucky me. what is it that i can help you with?}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{i've been watching that couple for months, they liked to make love with the blinds open. sometimes i would take pictures, you know, visual aides for later. it was fun, it was a great way to get off; i thought, until i saw you kill them. i have to tell you i have never ever felt a rush like that ever. i know you're the thumbprint killer, you've done this before. what i want is to go with you the next time you kill someone. and i would like that to be soon.}
<A>__{from the end of the table, marshall cackles a laugh.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{and you were worried that this was going to be unpleasant. the answer is simple. just tell him you've decided never to kill again and he'll go away.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{you enjoy watching me suffer, don't you?}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{in a word, yes.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{where do you think he has the other pictures?}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{he put them in a safety deposit box but i will bet the box is at the bank where he has his checking account and the key is on his keychain. he really wants to do this, he's not going to go to the cops.}
<A>__{mr. smith who has grown uneasy under mr. brooks's stare swallows:}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{so do we have a deal?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{from the angle of these pictures...}
<P>__{(taps the envelope)}
<D>__{... you live on the third floor of the apartment building across the alley from the couple's house.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{well... eh.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{yes or no, mr. smith?}
<A>__{mr. smith nods 'yes'.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{what time do you get home from work?}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{six thirty, seven, depending on the traffic.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{you can never come here again, you can never call me. do you understand that?}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{tomorrow night, not tonight, tomorrow night, at eight o'clock, leave your apartment and walk east. i will pick you up.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{if you're thinking of doing anything to me, mr. brooks...}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{we're both aware of the rules, mr. smith, but i feel i must warn you. if it turns out that you enjoy killing, it can become very addictive. it could ruin your life.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{i want to do this.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<P>__{(looks at marshall)}
<D>__{have i covered everything?}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{i can't think of anything else.}
<A>__{mr. brooks stands up and opens the door.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i will see you tomorrow night, mr. smith.}
<A>__{on his way out, mr. smith nods. mr. brooks closes the door. his chin drops on his chest and he sighs.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{please god, please help me find a way not to do this.}
