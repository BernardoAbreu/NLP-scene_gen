<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{as haven emerges and the sheriff holds a gun on him. angle on mick as down the street, with disgust, he lowers his gun. angle on prince as from a doorway he watches. stopping with a shake of his head the intent of a man beside him to shoot. full shot street as haven surrenders to the sheriff.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{all right, you march.}
<A>__{haven obeys, walking up the street the sheriff and the sheriff's horse behind him. people watch, appearing now in safety. the sheriff is pretty pleased. moving shot of haven and sheriff. as they go, haven's hands still aloft.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you loaded your gun for this?}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{no you did.}
<A>__{back of them can now be seen the figures of mick and prince and the other gunman, following at a little distance. going leisurely, now haven slows his pace so that the sheriff is closer behind him.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{come on, you! keep moving!}
<A>__{haven suddenly drops to his knees. the sheriff almost walks over him. the sheriff stumbles with an oath. haven grapples with him. haven snatches his gun, drags him by a headlock to the horse, flings him aside and then mounts. a second later he is away. shots ring out as mick and prince and the gunman shoot. haven rides on, bent low, out of town. the sheriff hides his bulk in the dust as the bullets fly. angle from charlie's office as she goes to the window, stares out at the flying form of haven. a slow smile comes over her face, bitter and grim, yet somehow faintly admiring... she sees mick mount a horse and start after haven. then she turns abruptly away.}
