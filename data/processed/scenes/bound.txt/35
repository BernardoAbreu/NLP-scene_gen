<L>__{interior caesar's apartment night}
<A>__{violet springs from the couch as the front door crashes open, caesar charging in. he is doubled over, clutching something to his stomach. he rushes to the kitchen, dumping a bloody bundle into the double sink. there is blood everywhere, smeared up and down caesar's front.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{oh my god ...}
<A>__{violet takes a step toward him, unsure of what has happened.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{don't worry. it ain't mine.}
<A>__{he pulls a bottle of whiskey and a glass from the cupboard.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{caesar, what happened?}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{it was unbelievable! un fucking believable!}
<A>__{he pours himeslf a shot, belting it back.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{goddammit, look at this shirt! it's ruined!}
<A>__{he begins unbuttoning the bloody shirt.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{it started when shelly took us to the money. i tell you, mickey malnato knows his shit, he does. shelly takes us right there.}
<A>__{he throws down another shot.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{so shelly's down on his knees and he's pulling out this bag of money from a safe in the floor and i'm staring at it like "holy fuck!" i mean, look at it }
<A>__{he tears open the bloody bag, wet money bricks spilling out.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{and all i can think is how the fuck did he do this when bang! johnnie caps him. blood sprays everywhere, all over the money. we've no idea if this is even all of it.}
<A>__{caesar is exasperated.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{and right then i go through the roof and boom! i belt the dumb fuck as hard as i can. i didn't care whose son he was, i just wanted to hit him again. knock some sense into that dumb son of a bitch.}
<A>__{he looks at the pile of bloody money.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{just look at this mess i got to deal with.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{what are you going to do with it?}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i told them to run it through the cycles. but i guess gino has plans for it because he's coming here tomorrow night to pick this shit up.}
<A>__{searching through a sink cabinet, he can't find what he needs.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{where the hell's the laundry detergent?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{ummm ... in the linen closet.}
<A>__{caesar walks down the ball to the bathroom. violet's eyes do not move from the pile of money. corky seems to come from nowhere. she whispers.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{come to my place in the morning. early, okay?}
<A>__{violet nods.}
