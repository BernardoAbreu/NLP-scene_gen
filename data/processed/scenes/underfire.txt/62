<L>__{exterior the rooftop of the cathedral of leon late in day}
<A>__{three sandinistas, pedro, and price emerge from a tunnel onto a lower level of the cathedral rooftop where a body lies. they are exposed immediately and automatic weapons fire opens up on them the sandinistas flatten against a wall, quickly becoming separated from price and pedro. two sandinistas race for cover behind a cupola in a move that is equally daring and foolish. the diversion draws fire from the two soldiers. price's light meter is instantly out taking readings as pedro huddles with him, curious at this strange act.}
<B>__{two guardia move into position to flush out the sandinistas}
<A>__{as they hide behind the cupolas. the hidden third guerrilla opens fire killing a guardia soldier, and the other soldier races for the belltower. as he does: the sandinistas seize the moment to rush closer, waving to pedro who slips along a wall with his bag of bombs. price starts to follow but is pinned down by fire and chooses to take refuge halfway in an alcove. as fire from both sides ricochets all over the rooftop, price switches camera lenses seemingly oblivious to the action. pedro meets one of the sandinistas in a protected niche and quickly they are unfolding his bag, setting the "muffin bombs" out on the rooftop. the other two sandinistas open heavy fire and briefly draw heavier fire from the belltower, as: pedro picks up a muffin weighing it briefly in his hand, like a pitcher. he studies the surroundings runners on first and third, no outs he spits in his left (his pitching hand) and rubs it in casually. pedro crosses himself, goes into an abbreviated pitching motion, then rears and fires the 'muffin' toward the belltower window, exposing himself as he does.}
<B>__{an explosion in the tower}
<A>__{pedro throws another into the tower another explosion. a guardia soldier staggers into the window and a sandinista drops him with a shot. all is quiet. the three sandinistas carefully rush the tower, looking in and motion to pedro and price that all is okay, and as they do: another shot rings out they whirl around pedro and price drop again. a lone guardia soldier fires at them from the other tower. a third sandinista drops him with a volley of fire again all is quiet. price follows the sandinistas to the first belltower and looks in. five bodies lie scattered and bloodied one of the guerrillas kicks a couple of them to make sure they are dead. in the corner, one body lies on top of another. satisfied, the sandinistas head for the other tower. price stays behind to take a few pictures and the ever present light meter appears, followed by several quick shots of the bodies. then price goes to one of the arched, stone windows. he looks out over the city. p.o.v. of leon dusk late in the afternoon now, the fighting is over for the day. an occasional gunshot. smoke rises from scattered places throughout the city. there is new rubble. the town is littered with bodies.}
<B>__{p.o.v. the red cross wagon moving through the street}
<A>__{a man walks in front of it, chanting slowly, rhythmically:}
<C>__{red cross man}
<D>__{hay heridas o muertes aqui? hay heridas o muertes aqui?}
<P>__{(are there wounded or dead here?)}
<A>__{we see a woman drag a body out into the street. the red cross man makes small stacks of bodies. he douses the bodies with gasoline and sets the pile aflame. then continues.}
<C>__{red cross man}
<D>__{hay heridas o muertes aqui?}
<A>__{price watches. he thinks he hears something, then dismisses it. something else. a voice, almost a whisper.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{price. you motherfucker, price, i'm talking to you.}
<A>__{he turns. one of the bodies speaks.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{where are those bastards... are they away?}
<A>__{price looks out the sandinistas are on the other side of the roof. this war gets stranger.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{they're away.}
<A>__{a body rolls out from under another body. blood splattered, smiling, wiping the blood from his face. it is oates, the mercenary from africa. he peeks out the window the sandinistas are on the other side of the roof. he whispers.}
<C>__{oates}
<D>__{what the fuck are you doing here?}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{what the fuck are you doing here?}
<A>__{for a moment they understand that they are there for the same reason they make their livings off war. oates peeks out the window nervously and repeatedly.}
<C>__{oates}
<D>__{awright, awright you're lookin' good... how ya like nicaragua?}
<A>__{oates readies his automatic weapon in case it's needed routine. price doesn't know how to answer.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{it's beautiful.}
<A>__{oates laughs quickly and softly he is tuned into the strangeness of price's answer.}
<C>__{oates}
<D>__{shitload o' greasers though, eh?}
<B>__{p.o.v. the sandinistas heading back toward us}
<A>__{oates and price see them, and oates crawls back under the pile of bodies. the sandinistas look into the belltower, all looks quiet, and they motion to price.}
<D>__{sandinista #1}

<D>__{it's getting late come on.}
