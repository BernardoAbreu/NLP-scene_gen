<A>__{rose shrugs. looks around.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{dumpster?}
<A>__{rose and norah lift the mattress and drag it to the door.}
<L>__{exterior trailer park day}
<A>__{rose and norah struggle to transport the stinking mattress to the dumpster. it is a clumsy process. the thing tips and falls on norah.}
<L>__{interior mall candy store day}
<A>__{tucked inside a mall, the candy store does brisk business. pimple faced clerks ring up clumps of overweight families. oscar pretends to look at hard candies while he listens to joe and the manager.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{you're telling me this fancy corn stuff is some kind of health food?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well, it's a candy... and a health food. absolutely. absolutely.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{yeah, i don't know. we don't have much more shelf space.}
<A>__{oscar spots a girl perusing wax lips. she looks to be about five or six. joe ignores the manager and reads ingredients off a twizzler package.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{glycerol monostearate? what is that? i can't even read that.}
<A>__{joe spins a can of fancy corn around and points to the ingredients.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{read that.}
<A>__{the manager leans close.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{high fructose }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no. the first thing listed. the number one ingredient.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{corn.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{exactly. corn. can you think of anything more wholesome? it's all american for christ's sake.}
<A>__{the manager's not buying it. oscar takes action. he positions himself next to the girl.}
<C>__{oscar}
<D>__{do you know if they sell fancy corn here?}
<A>__{the girl looks at him suspiciously.}
<C>__{oscar}
<D>__{do you even know what fancy corn is?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{oscar}
<D>__{well, do they sell it here?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i dunno.}
<A>__{she looks back to the lips and tries to ignore oscar.}
<C>__{oscar}
<D>__{i heard that the strawberry fancy corn gives you bionic strength.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{that's stupid.}
<C>__{oscar}
<D>__{it's true. some kind of chemical in the strawberry flavoring. if you eat a whole lot of it, it gives you bionic strength.}
<A>__{the girl gives oscar a long stare.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i don't believe you.}
<C>__{oscar}
<D>__{i don't care if you do or not.}
<A>__{the girl watches him for a moment and then walks over and tugs her mother's shirt.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i read where these chemicals are getting into the streams, making hermaphrodidic frogs! you think mothers want to expose their kids to that stuff? no way. more and more people are looking for healthy alternatives which is why the demand for this product is so huge right now.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{like i said, i already put in all the orders i want for this year.}
<A>__{just then, the girl's mother walks up to the manager.}
<C>__{girl's mother}
<D>__{excuse me. do you carry something called fancy corn?}
<A>__{joe looks at oscar. oscar smiles.}
