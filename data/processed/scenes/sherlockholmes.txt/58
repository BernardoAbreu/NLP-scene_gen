<A>__{holmes jumps off the shed, heads for the street one block over from baker street.}
<L>__{exterior london street}
<A>__{he runs down the mews in great haste, stops at the same alley that irene disappeared into but at the other side.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{holmes' pov down alley from concealment: irene walks towards a man holding a}
<B>__{bunch of roses.}
<C>__{man with roses}
<D>__{got some roses for you, sweetheart. cut you a deal `cos you're so pretty.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{oh, how nice of you.}
<A>__{even without the man who is scrofulous and sly no woman in her right mind would go down this alley.}
<L>__{38b interior alley}
<A>__{the man with the roses beckons irene forward. another man steps in behind her, trapping her. he closes in to grab her and whap!whap!whap! gets three cosh strikes across the chin, dropping him immediately. still holding the roses, the man finds himself smacked up against the bricks with irene's hand over his mouth. quick as a snake, she slices upwards with a razor sharp knife, cutting his belt, then his clothes, all the way to his collar. the move ends with irene's finger over her own mouth, signalling the mugger to be quiet. he obeys, eyes bulging. irene frisks him expertly. she's mugging the mugger. there is excitement in her eyes; this turns her on.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{oh, look, a wallet. doesn't look like yours, does it? and naughty boy here's another one. i will return them, shall i?}
<A>__{she takes both wallets, takes the roses }
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{these are lovely, thank you.}
<A>__{ and leaves, stepping daintily over the crumpled man on the floor. on second thoughts, she turns back, takes his wallet too, then leaves.}
