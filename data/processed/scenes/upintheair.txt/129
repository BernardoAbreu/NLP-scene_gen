<A>__{a group of tables have been slid together for the rehearsal dinner. ryan and alex find the dinner in full swing. ryan's sister julie, the bride, waves wildly.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{oh my god, ryan!}
<A>__{she hops up and gives him a hug.}
<C>__{julie }
<D>__{you must be alex. you are so beautiful. kara was right. did you get the basket?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{the basket was very lovely.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{tammy wrapped all of them.}
<A>__{tammy waves.}
<C>__{julie }
<D>__{ryan, you look so grown up.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{me? you're the one getting married.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i know, right? you haven't even seen my ring.}
<A>__{julie shows off her ring. it's not quite balanced and seems to favor quantity over quality.}
<C>__{julie }
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{jim designed it.}
<A>__{jim raises a hand. this is julie's husband to be and we can tell immediately that ryan isn't thrilled. ryan thinks of something. he pulls out the 5x7 photos they took of the jim & julie cut out:}
<B>__{.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i brought those photos you were asking for...}
<C>__{julie}
<P>__{(lights up)}
<D>__{oh great! they go over there.}
<A>__{julie points to a table and ryan walks over. when he gets there, we see almost a hundred photos pinned to a map of america. it's overwhelming. all of a sudden, his effort seems miniscule. ryan begins to pin his photos on the map over the cities where they were taken. he backs away to see it as a whole and his addition has already become invisible. ryan returns to the conversation with his sister and alex.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{there were quite a few already up there. almost couldn't find room.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i know, isn't it great how everyone chipped in?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{what gave you the idea to do something so...}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(helps)}
<D>__{... substantial?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{well, jim has a lot of our nest egg invested in this real estate venture right now. so when we went over our finances, a honeymoon just didn't seem affordable this second... so i thought... hey, just because we can't travel doesn't mean we can't have pictures.}
<A>__{the idea of this lands on ryan pretty hard.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it was a great idea.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{thanks.}
