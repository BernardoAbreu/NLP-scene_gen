<L>__{interior club}
<A>__{steve has been trapped by a young woman in spectacles, a much too earnest devotee of progressive jazz.}
<C>__{devotee}
<D>__{i'm terribly interested in jazz serious jazz. you studied with milhaud, didn't you? this is such an interesting fusion of the traditional, classical form with the new progressive style, i just wanted to ask you how you came to form the group... }
<B>__{chico}
<A>__{he comes through the curtains of the doorway, pausing as he sees that steve is involved with the intellectual young woman.}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{steve glancing at chico over the shoulder of the intellectual young woman. seeing that chico has something to say to him, he wriggles out of the young woman's clutches by passing the buck to the unfortunate to fred katz, who is descending from the bandstand behind him.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{well, we just sort of got together.}
<P>__{(turning to introduce fred)}
<D>__{maybe if you ask mr. katz...he writes the stuff, you know.}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(blankly)}
<D>__{huh?}
<B>__{resume chico}
<A>__{steve joins chico and they go through the curtains into the corridor outside.}
<B>__{corridor}
<A>__{chico, smiling, explains:}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{don't waste your time there, man. you've got something better waiting outside...}
<P>__{(as steve looks at him)}
<D>__{susie's out there.}
<B>__{steve}
<A>__{his reaction betrays some emotion. (over scene the intermission pianist has begun to play a blues number.) steve moves a quick step towards the door to the courtyard, then hesitates almost as if he was afraid to go out. he meets chico's eye again.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{what did she say...?}
<B>__{chico}
<A>__{he is amused, but sympathetic.}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{you proposed to her, not me.}
<P>__{(slapping him on the back)}
<D>__{go get your answer...}
<B>__{courtyard}
<A>__{susan, waiting at the foot of the iron steps, turns as steve comes out on the fire escape above. steve comes quickly down the steps towards her, slowing down when he gets a few paces away from her.}
<B>__{susan}
<A>__{she looks up at steve.}
<B>__{steve}
<A>__{a close shot. in his expression we read his mute inquiry...}
<B>__{resume susan}
<A>__{quite deliberately, with her eyes moistened by love and affection...she nods.}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{great relief and happiness can be seen in the boy's face. after a moment, he moves to her and she to him. they embrace swiftly, hold each other close and then kiss with passion. presently, when the kiss is over, susan speaks softly.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(in a whisper)}
<D>__{steve...i will...i will try to make a good wife.}
<A>__{steve is still too choked with relief to speak. for answer, he clasps her more tightly to him. the beam of light which falls on the iron stairs behind them, narrows and then is extinguished...}
<B>__{corridor}
<A>__{paul has closed the door. turning, he shares a look with the grinning chico and fred katz who has managed to escape from the young woman. before there is time for either of them to make a remark, sidney comes through the curtains from the club.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{hi, fellows. where's the chief?}
<A>__{sidney's manner is very friendly. but it is immediately apparent from the reaction of the other three boys that none of them likes sidney. fred is deliberately uncomprehending.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(who gets the point)}
<D>__{dallas. is he around?}
<A>__{chico's back is to the closed door which opens onto the courtyard. chico nods in the opposite direction towards the stairs.}
<C>__{chico}
<P>__{(unhelpfully)}
<D>__{yeah, he's around somewhere. upstairs, maybe.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(coldly, as he goes)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<B>__{courtyard}
<A>__{steve and susan are still embracing. steve is exultantly proud and happy.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(incoherent)}
<D>__{this is big, you know. very big! let's go out later, drink some firewater. with the boys. fred can call millie and }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{steve, i'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until i tell my brother...}
<B>__{steve}
<A>__{his sobering reaction shows this is something important.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{you haven't told him yet...}
<B>__{susan}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.}
<B>__{steve and susan}
<A>__{turning her head, she makes a little gesture, an unconscious movement, putting her fingers to her brow as if feeling a headache.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{he isn't going to like it.}
<A>__{susan says nothing. she looks to steve, smiling, but the smile is not too confident.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you sure you don't want me to be with you...?}
<A>__{susan stoutly shakes her head. defensively she reassures steve:}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted. he isn't perfect, but }
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{but he isn't going to like this, susie. and he makes you nervous, not me. no, i take that back he makes me nervous, too. but i wouldn't give him a second thought if not for you.}
<A>__{the topic evidently makes susan uneasy. in an effort to dismiss something that she does not want to think about, susan puts her arms around steve's neck again.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{let's forget him and }
<A>__{but steve is not so ready to change the subject.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{his stooge, falco, is around i saw him walk in.}
<P>__{(soberly)}
<D>__{he's been spying on me for weeks, susie.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(quickly, perhaps too quickly)}
<D>__{darling, i don't care really i don't. sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business }
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(gently insisting)}
<D>__{but he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(pleading)}
<D>__{steve, dear, please forget all of this. what can it matter after tomorrow?}
<A>__{now steve responds. he grins, holds her closer.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i have a message for you; i love you.}
<P>__{(kissing her lightly)}
<D>__{may i dedicate the next number to you?...and the next, and the nexterior every sunday i will buy you a new bonnet }
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(amused, but moved)}
<D>__{if the stores are open }
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{and on monday, i will take it off and stroke your light brown hair and }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{and on tuesday hasenpfeffer.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(abruptly grinning)}
<D>__{how do you think i realized i love you?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i made you write a beautiful song...}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{no, you had me eating that chinese food!...}
<A>__{they laugh and enjoyably; but then, as the camera moves, we realize that sidney is there on the fire escape above them; his manner is affable.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{can more than two enjoy this joke...}
<P>__{(to susan)}
<D>__{hello, susie, i didn't expect to find you here.}
<A>__{steve says nothing. but he obviously resents the intrusion and finds it difficult to conceal the fact. sidney comes down the fire escape towards them.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{where's those glossy prints you promised? tonight's the latest i can place them }
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(barely polite)}
<D>__{well, thanks, anyway let's forget it.}
<P>__{(to susan)}
<D>__{it's cold out here, susie.}
<A>__{steve makes a move to lead susan back inside. it is a gesture which appears to dismiss sidney. sidney chooses to take umbrage:}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(lightly sarcastic)}
<D>__{let me apologize for getting you that press spread. it's been an honor to serve you gratis.}
<A>__{steve turns to sidney; his manner is quiet but challenging:}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(levelly)}
<D>__{i get the feeling, falco, that you're always snooping around...}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(quickly intervening)}
<D>__{steve, stop it please...}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{frank d'angelo has followed sidney out onto the fire escape; other members of the quintet have also appeared.}
<C>__{d'angelo}
<D>__{what are you boys fighting about?}
<A>__{aggressively indignant, sidney throws up his hands; he knocks on the metal of the fire escape.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{kill me! find me a door somewhere i walked in without knocking!}
<A>__{sidney is trying to needle steve; steve's temper would normally have exploded; but now he controls it.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what i said i said you snoop. for instance, what were you doing around my hotel the other night?}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(needling)}
<D>__{begging your pardon, i haven't been down the bowery in years!}
<C>__{d'angelo}
<P>__{(soothingly)}
<D>__{come on boys, break it up...}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(overriding d'angelo)}
<D>__{the next time you want information, falco, don't scratch for it like a dog ask for it like a man!}
<B>__{sidney}
<A>__{his face tightens; he appears to be mortally insulted and controlling himself with difficulty. he turns his back swiftly on steve, addressing susan in a voice that has a sharp edge.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{if you're going home, susie, i will drop you off...}
<A>__{sidney starts quickly up the fire escape. this makes steve angry and he steps forward to follow him. but chico contrives, without seeming to interfere to obstruct steve.}
<C>__{chico}
<P>__{(easily)}
<D>__{time for the next set, chief...}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{just a minute, chico.}
<B>__{corridor}
<A>__{sidney comes inside. when he is out of sight or the group in the courtyard, his manner swiftly changes. it's obvious now that his indignation was assumed; now he looks back towards the courtyard and there is shrewdness in his eyes; he is assessing steve's temper. but, presently, seeing d'angelo and the boys returning, he moves back to the curtains into the club.}
<B>__{courtyard}
<A>__{as d'angelo and the other boys go inside, steve turns back to susan.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(fondly)}
<D>__{just so you don't leave me in a minor key.}
