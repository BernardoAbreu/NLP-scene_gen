<A>__{jacques is in bed with johana. they are both asleep. suddenly, he sits up, as he always does after his recurrent dream. he's wide awake, looks over at her sleeping. she sleeps peacefully like a baby. quietly, gently, he eases out of bed and walks to the open window. he stands on the balcony, staring at the sea. then in the distance in the moonlight, a dolphin leaps out of the water, once, twice, a third time. jacques laughs and goes back to the bed where he sits down next to johana. she is still sound asleep.}
