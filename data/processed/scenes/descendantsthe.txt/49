<L>__{interior living room day}
<A>__{they sit together now on sofas. alexandra appears drained from crying.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i just found out yesterday. we have to go through this thing together, you and scottie and i. and i need to go around and tell people what's happening our family and close friends. sometimes i will want you to come with me. other times i need you to watch scottie.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{you want me to go around with you and tell everyone that mom's going to die? what's the point of that? breaking the news, watching them cry, dealing with their emotions. how depressing is that going to be? just call them.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{alex, nobody wants to do any of this. but we need to tell grandpa and tutu, a few friends. they have the right to know and to be able to say goodbye.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{i don't want to talk about mom with anyone.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{whatever you fought about with her at christmas, you need to drop it. grow up. you love your mother. your mother loves you. move on.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{i can't drop it.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you have to.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{you really don't have a clue, do you? dad, she was cheating on you.}
<A>__{whoa.}
<C>__{alexandra }
<D>__{that's what we fought about. when i was home at christmas, i caught her with some guy. it made me sick to see her near you. i went back to school thinking that was it, i was done with her. i was going to call and tell you everything. but then the accident happened, and i was waiting until she woke up, i guess. and you, you didn't even suspect. right?}
<P>__{(off his silence)}
<D>__{that disgusted me too. you're always so busy.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{caught her with some guy? what does that mean?}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{brandy and i were on our way to swim in the black point pool, and suddenly i see mom and some douchebag walk into a house. his house, i guess.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{just a guy? it could have been anybody.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{he had his hand on her ass. it was gross.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you're sure it was her.}
<P>__{(off her nod)}
<D>__{then what?}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{then nothing. she went into the house. a few days later i told her i knew what she was doing.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{first she acted like she didn't know what i was talking about. like i'm blind. then she got super mad and started yelling at me and denied it. that's when i decided i didn't want anything more to do with her.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{who is he?}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{i don't know. some guy.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what did he look like?}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{dark hair.}
<A>__{matt stands up, walks in a little circle he literally does not know which way to turn. then he knows.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{watch scottie.}
