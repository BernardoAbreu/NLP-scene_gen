<L>__{exterior teklanika river day}
<A>__{in the trees beside the river, we find chris. the river is not yet in sight but chris starts to hear it: a building rumble. as chris exits the treeline, there she is: the teklanika at full flood. seventy five foot wide banks, replacing the narrow ice canal of four months earlier. snowmelt from glaciers high in the alaska range, its opaque glacial sediment the color of wet concrete. and what had been a distant rumble in the woods, now had the volume and power of a freight train, a seventy five foot wide one. chris grabs a hold of a riverside branch and takes one slow, careful step into the river. without mercy, wham! the river kicks his feet out from under him! the branch he holds snaps! by some miracle, his hands move like lightening and he grabs a lower, sturdier branch below, saving himself from a certain death. we see the broken branch catapulted down river and into a rocky shoot below. he pulls himself back onto the bank, drops his pack at riverside, and eases to a sitting position beside it.}
