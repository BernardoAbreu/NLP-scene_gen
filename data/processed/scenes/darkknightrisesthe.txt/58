<L>__{interior applied sciences moments later}
<A>__{fox leads wayne into the vast, gadget filled space. they pass tumblers with different weapons configurations...}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{i figured you'd have shut this place down.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{it was always shut down, officially.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{but all this new stuff?}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{after your father died, wayne enterprises set up fourteen different defense subsidiaries. i've spent years shuttering them and consolidating all the prototypes under one roof. my roof.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{stop them falling into the wrong hands. besides, i thought someone might get some use out of them...}
<A>__{wayne shakes his head.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{sure i can't tempt you to something? pneumatic crampons? infrared lenses? least let me get you something for that leg.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{it's fine the use it gets these days.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{well, then i have just the thing for an eccentric billionaire who doesn't like to walk...}
<A>__{fox opens a door we glimpse a sleek vehicle. wayne's eyes light up.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{now you're just showing off.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{defense department project for tight geometry urban pacification. rotors configured for maneuvering between buildings without recirculation.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{what's it called?}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{it has a long and uninteresting wayne enterprises designation. so i took to calling it the bat. and yes, mr. wayne, it does come in black.}
<A>__{wayne touches its sleek side. marveling.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{works great except for the autopilot.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{what's wrong with that?}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{software based instability. take a better mind than mine to fix it.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{better mind?}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{i was trying to be modest. a less busy mind. yours, perhaps.}
<A>__{wayne looks wistfully at the machine. turns away.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{i told you. i retired, lucius.}
