<L>__{interior headmistress's office. day.}
<A>__{the office is dark, wood panelled, foreboding, apparently designed to put all visitors ill at ease. the headmistress would probably choose to be wood panelled if she could. she's tweedy, bespectacled, severe. there is a knock at the door. she doesn't look up from her paperwork.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{come.}
<A>__{jenny enters, looking young and frightened.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{ah. miss mellor.}
<A>__{jenny tries to look back at her with all the courage she can muster.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{we're all very excited about your forthcoming trip to paris. our excitement, indeed, knows no bounds. some of us can talk of little else.}
<A>__{jenny looks at her feet.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{an older man, i understand. a word of warning, miss mellor. there may well have been the odd sixth form girl who has lost an important part of herself perhaps the best part while under our supervision. these things happen, regrettably. if, however, we are made aware of this loss, then of course the young lady in question would have to continue her studies elsewhere, if she still has any use for `a' levels. is that clear?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{can i go now?}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{jenny turns round and walks out without saying another word.}
