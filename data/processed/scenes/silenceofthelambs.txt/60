<L>__{exterior sidewalk of the funeral home potter, west va. day}
<A>__{sound of organ music, as clarice, carrying her fingerprint kit, mounts some steps to the sidewalk. she stops, seeing }
<B>__{country people}
<A>__{in their somber best, filing into the mortuary for a service. the music "shall we gather at the river?" is issuing from the open double doors. several of the mourners glance over at her curiously.}
<B>__{angle on clarice}
<A>__{staring back at the mourners, hearing the music, as a sense memory is triggered in her... in flashback low angle, moving as we approach, down the aisle of a country chapel, an open wooden coffin. sad country faces turn, looking at us from the flanking pews. the b.g. organ hymn is "shall we gather...?" the sad, 10 year old clarice in her best dress, is reluctantly approaching the casket. her hands are held by the plump hands of unseen matrons. child's pov on the looming coffin... closer and closer... until finally she can see, lying inside it... her dead father, arms folded, his marshal's badge still pinned to his lapel.}

<A>__{new angle (present day) as the grownup clarice turns towards the impatient crawford. like her, he carries a large case.}
