<A>__{on shurlock's humorless face hitchcock sits opposite him at the big conference table.}
<C>__{geoffrey shurlock}
<D>__{i told you, i distinctly saw both the stabbing and the nudity. we're denying your seal, mr. hitchcock.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{i take your opinion very seriously. but what you think you're seeing is purely informed by the power of suggestion. i assure you that once you view the final version with mr. herrmann's lovely, lyrical score...}
<C>__{geoffrey shurlock}
<D>__{a "lyrical score" won't change my opinion. all that innuendo and half naked groping really, hitch.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{would you mind if we had a word in private, geoffrey?}
<A>__{shurlock gestures his staff out. hitch moves closer.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{i have a modest proposal to make. if you're willing to leave the shower sequence as it is, i will reshoot the opening love scene to your exact specifications.}
<A>__{shurlock reacts with surprise.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{in fact, i'd welcome your personal supervision on the set.}
<A>__{shurlock is more flattered than he'd care to admit.}
<C>__{geoffrey shurlock}
<D>__{my specifications?}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{if only audiences could fully appreciate how tirelessly you work to help us entertain them while protecting them from filth and indecency.}
<A>__{shurlock studies hitchcock's sphinx like expression.}
