<L>__{interior graham house hallway & kitchen}
<A>__{are empty. dark shadows play against darkened walls. o.s. we hear crashing wave. moonlight makes trees whipped in the wind throw dappled shadows across the corridor. molly enters the frame in close shot. we track with her in a three quarter rear shot behind the back of her head. she feels vulnerable. the dappled leaves whip across her face in a sudden gust. molly's head snaps around. molly's pov: glass portico with the tree moving in the wind. beyond is the ocean with moonlight on the surf. nothing.}
