<L>__{exterior george on his motorcycle moving day}
<A>__{music, the byrds, "turn, turn, turn." he pulls up to a rustic house. he gets his little case off the bike and then hesitates. he walks to the door and rings the bell. jackie answers the door. she seems distracted and, at the same time, a little wary. much the same, in fact, as george.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{hi. c'mon in.}
<A>__{jackie's wearing a robe. they walk into the living room, the dogs yelping.}
<C>__{jackie }
<D>__{shut up, it's all right.}
<P>__{(to george, automatically)}
<D>__{do you want a drink?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{no, thanks.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{well, i do.}
<A>__{she starts to mix herself a drink. she changes her mind, pours herself a shot of whiskey and hurls it back. she does it again. when she turns back to george he's looking at her noncommittally.}
<C>__{jackie }
<D>__{where do you want to do this?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{probably the bathroom.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{can't you do it out here?}
<A>__{george looks around.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well, it depends. if you just wanted a combout. i guess i could.}
<A>__{jackie turns to him, honestly uncertain.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{well, what do you think?}
<A>__{george himself is tentative.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i don't know. why don't you sit down.}
<A>__{jackie looks around a little at a loss and finally sits down on the glass topped coffee table.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(meaning her position)}
<D>__{is this all right?}
<A>__{george moves in. he draws the drapes back so light comes in from the backyard and the swimming pool can be seen.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{he takes her hair in his hands. the contact makes them both nervous. she looks away. george continues to run his hands through her hair.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(a little nervous)}
<D>__{well, what do you think?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i'd cut it...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you would?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yeah, i think so...}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(almost irritable)}
<D>__{you don't seem very sure.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{no, i'm sure.}
<A>__{there is a moment where jackie is trying to decide whether she'll let george actually cut her hair.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{okay... but i want you to know one thing.}
<P>__{(almost a threat)}
<D>__{i've got to look great tonight, i mean i have to look great, okay?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{okay.}
