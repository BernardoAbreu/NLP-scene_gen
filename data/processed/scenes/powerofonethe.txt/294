<A>__{squeezing again, bellowing. pk opens his eyes, draws his head back, and butts botha in the face. botha's nose shatters. the grip slackens a bit. pk hits him in the face again. botha drops pk to the floor as he screams at the unbelievable pain. blood pours from his nose.}
<B>__{pk}
<A>__{catches his breath and is on botha. he throws three hard punches to his face. enraged, botha howls and swings at pk. pk goes underneath his arm and hooks three times into the ribs. botha grunts, hurt. he swings again with the other hand.}
