<L>__{exterior north vale stables night}
<A>__{the light of the full moon illuminates the night and we see jackie and annabelle sitting on a horse. annabelle in front, jackie with a strong hold on her. both have their nightgowns tucked into their jeans, coats over them.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{hold tight, sweetheart.}
<A>__{she kicks the horse forward and they head off toward the rolling hills in the distance. jackie and annabelle ride faster and faster along the trail. jackie has one arm firmly around annabelle's waist and controls the horse with the other. jackie closes her eyes for a moment, allowing the wind to wash over her. the smells and sounds of the night seem to free her, give her strength. annabelle relaxes against her mother and giggles with delight. jackie soon joins her, and the sounds of their laughter break the silence of the night. they come to a stop at the crest of a small hill and we now see the tears on jackie's face. annabelle can't see, and stares out at the moonlit valley before them.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i'm never, never going to forget this.}
<A>__{annabelle snuggles back. happy.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{never say never.}
<A>__{jackie kisses the top of her baby's head.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you're old enough to learn the loophole. you can say 'never, never'. if you mean it enough. to say it twice.}
<A>__{annabelle yawns. so content in her mother's arms.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{i will remember. always, always.}
<A>__{so jackie grips a little tighter. breathes a single word, just loud enough to hear...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{promise.}
