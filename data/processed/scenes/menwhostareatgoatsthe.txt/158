<A>__{bill django sits cross legged in the sand, drinking from a bottle of whiskey, watching the sun set. bob marches up to him, stands awkward but determined.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i think you should go and see lyn, sir. (beat) he needs you.}
<A>__{bill doesn't answer.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{the man crossed a desert to see you again.}
<A>__{bill takes a long drink, stares at the sky. bob watches him with mounting frustration.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{you know, he told me all these stories about bill django, and i was pretty excited to meet you, but i've gotta tell you...you're one big disappointment.}
<A>__{bill doesn't react. bob starts to walk away then turns back, and throws the feather down at bill's feet.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{he told me to give you that back. i don't know why. its supposed to be a mark of honour isn't it? i don't see how you deserve that.}
<A>__{beat. bill turns to look at bob for the first time. he takes a long drink.}
<C>__{bill django}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it isn't real.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{what isn't?}
<C>__{bill django}
<D>__{the feather. twenty thousand dollar fine for taking an eagle feather. this one's off a turkey.}
<P>__{you just die the tip black. (beat)}
<D>__{don't tell lyn.}
<A>__{bill stares at the feather.}
<C>__{bill django }
<D>__{none of it was real.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{that isn't true. that isn't true.}
<A>__{he looks around for inspiration notices a lone cloud floating in the sky. bob places his fingers on his temples and stares at the cloud, focuses, desperate, hopeful... bill notices and watches, curious. slowly, the cloud fades and disappears. bob can't believe it. he looks at bill who is staring at him. he has tears in his eyes.}
