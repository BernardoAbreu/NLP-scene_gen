<ACTION>__{A LONG LENS SHOT of a far distant metallic object hovering just above the ground -- maybe two or three miles away. The heat waves and the light refraction off the desert- scape make the object undulate rhythmically, keeping its true shape and appearance indistinct. The VIDEO CAMERA recording this scene zooms back, then pans over -- revealing a semicircle of US Army vehicles and personnel.  Army Engineers with their tripod-mounted scopes and binoculars are shoulder to shoulder with the armed infantry.  Everyone stares off at the same point on the horizon.  Waiting. The VIDEO CAMERA movements are HANDHELD, unsteady, as it moves through the line of Army personnel to reveal a second, less organized semicircle of observers fifty yards behind the Army.  LOCALS from nearby towns perch in truck beds and on car roofs, Budweiser and Fritos at hand, eyes glued to the distant object. The VIDEO CAMERA image climbs up onto the roof of a parked local TV van, finds the object again in the distance, zooms in, and waits, like everyone else. Abruptly the VIDEO IMAGE contracts, becoming a box CHROMAKEYED behind CNN reporter DUNCAN CRAIS.}

His eyes go wide as Kipling whips back his coat and yanks out a short combat pump-shotgun and aims it right at him.  The Raincoat alien pulls an identical gun and covers the door. Sykes and Tuggle react to the firepower inside.}

The Proprietor is quickly filling a paper bag with cash from the register. The PROPRIETOR'S WIFE, a middle-aged alien woman, stands in the doorway from the back, frozen in fear.  The Raincoat alien dances from foot to foot, antsy, wired. Sykes and Tuggle crouch at the car directly across the street from the store entrance.}

Bills fall out, but he doesn't care.  Then, without warning, Kipling whips up the twelve gauge and blows a hole in the Proprietor's chest!  The Proprietor slams back against the shelves, slides to the floor.  Kipling leans over the counter and FIRES another round into the Proprietor.}

The Driver turns and fires at Sykes. Sykes ducks down, and the car he's hiding behind is sprayed with bullets. A forty-foot moving van pulls down the street between Sykes and the Driver.  Once the truck is past, Sykes is standing behind the bullet-riddled car, gun ready.  He rapid-fires -- creaming the human Driver. Tuggle is pinned down behind the thin lamp post by the shotgun fire from Kipling and Raincoat alien.}

Tuggle seizes the opportunity, jumps from behind the lamp post and runs to the stalled civilian car.  He slides across the hood and drops behind the car for cover. Tuggle slowly pokes his head up to peer through the car window.  His gaze is met by the face of the OLD MAN driver who is still inside the car.}

They return fire and he slides down to safety behind the car.  Or so he thinks. Glass rains down on him as the car windows are cremated by the shotgun blasts.  He flinches as another blast hits the car.  He looks over.  There's a big exit hole in the fender beside him.  THE SHOT WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE CAR. Another exit hole is BLASTED, inches from his shoulder. Panicked, he scrambles along the side of the car -- BLASTS and exit holes following him until he reaches the front of the car.  He has nowhere left to go and-- -- a BLAST comes through the car and catches him squarely in the chest throwing him back onto the street. Sykes' head jerks around -- in time to see his partner of nine years blown away. Kipling keeps firing in Tuggle's direction until his shotgun CLICKS empty.}

Huge chunks of the crate he dives behind fly off into the night.  Sykes, on his belly, scrambles deeper among the crates. Raincoat's shotgun CLICKS empty now.  He drops it, swings down off the fire escape, runs off. Sykes is up again in a flash, pounding after him.}
<LOC>__{EXT.  TUNNEL STREET - NIGHT}

<LOC>__{INT.  TUNNEL - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The murkiness of the tunnel engulfs him as he moves through the mouth.  He tries to control his breathing so he can hear.  The only SOUND is his own shoes scuffing along the asphalt. Then he HEARS -- another set of FOOTSTEPS.  Rapid footsteps, coming toward him, ECHOING.  He can't tell from which direction!  He spins, just as a LARGE SHAPE lunges for him with an alien CRY. It's the wired Raincoat alien.  Sykes gets his gun up just in time and FIRES -- once, twice, three times.  Raincoat alien is knocked backwards to the wet asphalt by the blasts.  Sykes approaches the body slowly.  With an inhuman ROAR, the alien snaps forward, lunging at Sykes with outstretched arms.  Sykes jumps back, startled, and FIRES twice more at the pale figure.  Raincoat goes down and stays down. Sykes relaxes for the briefest moment.  Then he HEARS it... a distinctive CLICKING SOUND, metal on metal.  Sykes looks up and -- Kipling drops down on him from directly above!  Sykes goes down in a heap.  He's managed to hold onto the gun and as Kipling comes for him, he swings the gun hand around.  Kipling sees it, lashes out, slamming the gun from Sykes' hand.  Sykes tries to get to his feet, but the alien grabs him and flings him down the tunnel. A SIREN is HEARD approaching in background. Kipling moves in to deliver the coup de grace.  As he draws near, Sykes HEARS that distinctive CLICKING SOUND again. SYKES' P.O.V. Though his vision is BLURRED, Sykes still gets a good look at an exotic silver bracelet on the alien's wrist.  The strands of this bracelet are what make the CLINKING NOISE.}
