<L>__{interior windsor castle, brown's quarters day}
<A>__{brown sits on the edge of the bed in only his undergarments. his face, arms, legs and fingers are livid with bruises, but he sits there, stiff backed and gritting his teeth, while archie crouches in front of him, tending to his wounds.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{and she sent no word down?}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{they said you were drunk.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why don't you tell her the truth?}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{she'll think it's her fault for keeping me.}
<A>__{archie completes one of the dressings when brown suddenly reaches back and starts trying to put on his shirt.}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{what are you doing?!}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i'm getting dressed.}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{you've got three broken ribs, man!}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i've got my duties to attend to.}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{don't be an idiot! you're in no fit state to go anywhere.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{she'll be worried about me.}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{she'll get over it.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i can't let her down now, archie.}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{and when was the last time she put herself out for you? look, john, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{oh, i'm much more than that.}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{you watch your tongue.}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{come on, man, i'm telling you what you already know.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{you know nothing about her!}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{when are you gonna see it, john? she doesn't give a damn about you.}
<A>__{brown lunges for the bedside drawer and pulls out a card showing a coy picture of a pretty woman. he holds it up, eyes blazing.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{from the queen!}
<A>__{he reads out the inscription.}
<C>__{brown }
<D>__{my lips may give a message better of christmas love than e'en this letter.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{to my best friend, j.b. from his best friend, v.r.}
<P>__{(he thrusts it in his brother's face)}
<D>__{best friend!}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{aye.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{she means it.}
<A>__{archie stares at him.}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{she'll drop you. when she's done with you, she'll drop you.}

<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{out!}
<A>__{archie steps back but brown roars at him.}
