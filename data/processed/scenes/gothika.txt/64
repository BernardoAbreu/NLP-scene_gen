<A>__{flashback interior miranda and doug's house night a breathless miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick streak of blood on it. she looks down at doug, crawling on hands and knees. he moans horribly, in shock. she grabs the heavy axe from the floor and follows him. he reaches for the coffee table with the telephone on it and makes a move to grab it. he has all the speed of a dying turtle, and that's pretty much what he resembles. miranda bites her lip, lifts the heavy axe with both hands. doug's hand grabs the phone. miranda swings the axe over her head and it comes down straight at camera. miranda wipes her face again, catches her reflection in the mirror over the mantel and stares we hear that sound. the wettish gurgling sound. miranda stares at the mirror looking for the source of it. for an instant we see the teenage girl's reflection there, beckoning. but now she's gone and miranda is left studying her own demented expression and now flames rise around her. she looks down at her feet: no fire. blood on her clothes, axe still in her hands. looks back up at:}
<B>__{the mirror version of miranda}
<A>__{shows a serene expression on her face. fire enveloping her. she slowly lifts her hands over her head. in place of the axe there are chains attached to shackles on her wrists. she is completely naked, as if purified like an extreme version of anima sola. (a biblical icon in which a woman in fiery purgatory awaits her fate.) time stands still for a mesmerizing moment when the mirror shatters to pieces and we're back to reality. miranda stares at the axe she's flung at it.}
