<L>__{interior denver's room morning.}
<A>__{denver finished dressing. she has been able to maintain a semblance of order about her person and room.. but as she steps out into the second floor hallway, we see the same disarray as downstairs... she passes by baby sugg's old room and discovers; beloved, sprawled across the bed, half naked. her belly is huge, her body unwashed. she looks, and behaves, like a wild animal... a broken lamp lies on the fall pushed over by her leg as she shifted in bed. her feet, overhanging the bed, are still touching the bedside table where the lamp sat. she is awake now making a small hole larger in baby sugg's old quilt.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{you shouldn't be in here?}
<A>__{beloved jolts her head up to denver. she doesn't like being looked at unawares...}
<C>__{beloved}
<D>__{what do you know about it? i sleep where i want.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{you best leave that quilt alone. that was grandma's quilt.}
<A>__{beloved looks at denver, then at the quilt then abruptly tears the hole apart with one strong pull. triumphant, she gets out of bed and exits, passing denver;}
<C>__{beloved}
<D>__{breakfast ready? i'm hungry!}
