<L>__{interior family room later}
<A>__{rosa sits in a chair. nico on the couch, holding julian. sara faces him. tears have stained her cheeks, but she is in control of her emotions now.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{ you've got to do it, nico. you know you have to.}
<A>__{whatever sara is proposing, nico is dead set against it.}
<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{listen to her, nicola.}
<P>__{(dead serious)}
<D>__{whatever you think of him, federico is family. he is our family.}
<A>__{nico makes no response. instead, he lifts julian, nuzzles him tenderly.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{ever notice how clean babies smell? like nothing in the world has touched them yet.}
<A>__{sara glances to rosa. rosa knows what she wants. dis creetly rosa rises, exits. sara and nico are alone.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{if you won't go to him, i will.}
<C>__{nico}
<P>__{(in pain)}
<D>__{don't push me like this }
<A>__{her eyes meet his loving, but desperate.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{branca can put us on a plane but where can we fly to? tibet? the moon? there's nowhere they can't find us.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{you don't know what the hell you're talking about.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i'm talking about everything i've learned from you in the past five years.}
<A>__{nico is in agony.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{you know i can't go to him.}
<A>__{sara takes both his hands in hers.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{do you know why i love you? do you know what it is about you that i've always loved?}
<P>__{(as nico fights his own emotion)}
<D>__{pride. it's what you have inside. you don't live the way other people live. you trust what you see as right and won't let anyone or anything make you stray from it.}
<A>__{move in past sara to nico's face.}
<C>__{sara }
<D>__{but now that pride may kill all of us.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you've got to swallow that pride, nico. choke on it if you have to. lay it aside.}
<A>__{another angle nico and sara close together, with their baby between them. sara buries her face against her husband's chest. nico's arm goes around her. he holds her tight.}
