<C>__{matt}
<D>__{any last words?}
<C>__{sebastian}

<D>__{here we go.}
<A>__{slowly the flesh on sebastian's arm begins dissolving, revealing the complex network of nerves, blood vessels and flesh beneath it.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{shit... it's starting to burn... oh god. it hurts. i didn't think it would hurt.}
