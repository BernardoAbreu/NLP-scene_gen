<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{hey, zack?}

<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{he did it.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{but the murder's way too fucking clumsy. and this guy's a major intellectual. top of his yale class, a rhodes gig, tenured at 27, two books. he's an academic stud.}

<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{a person's politics has nothing to do with their propensity to commit crime.}

<C>__{zack}
<D>__{wrong, seventy three percent of all serial killers vote republican.}
