<A>__{we're right off queens boulevard on a busy side street where lou pacifico, 30, is taking book. lou is short, dark and handsome. he leans against the wall of a liquor store.}
<D>__{passerby #1 deuce and an eightball on go down, rita in the eighth.}
<A>__{lou writes quickly on a small pad. after a beat, another passerby leans in and whispers something to lou. lou writes quickly again. >from across the street an old woman sticks her head out of a four story walk up. this is lou's mother who speaks with a heavy italian accent.}

<D>__{i'm telling you they said it's the washington foreskins! foreskins! foreskins! foreskins!}
<A>__{people in the street are now starting to look up at this old woman screaming "foreskins!" louis quickly crosses the street to his apartment house. but at that moment, a soccer ball bounces toward him from where a group of kids are playing in an alley. out of pure instinct, lou gives it a mighty boot. we follow the arc of the ball as it sails down the block. everyone stops to admire the kick. still airborne, the ball crosses queens boulevard. at that moment, a very old mafioso type is being helped from his limo by several lieutenants. pow! the ball hits the old guy right in the back of the head, knocking off his porkpie hat and dropping him to the pavement like a bullet. the lieutenants pull pistols and surround their fallen leader.}
