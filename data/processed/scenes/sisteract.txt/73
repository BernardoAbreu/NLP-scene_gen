<L>__{interior choir rehearsal room day}
<A>__{the choir continues its dreadful rendition of the hymn let thy thoughts he guided. christy is not singing; she is clearly in pain. mary lazarus stops the song. one of the nuns has to nudge sister alma to stop her playing.}
<C>__{mary lazarus}
<D>__{mary clarence, are you with us?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{um, i don't really know this one...}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{mary clarence has a background in music. that's what reverend mother said.}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<P>__{(eagerly)}
<D>__{really, mary clarence? were you a choirmistress?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{sure. kind of... free lance.}
<C>__{mary lazarus}
<P>__{(circling christy)}
<D>__{free lance? oh really? you think i don't see? you think i took vows yesterday? i know what you're up to. you and reverend mother.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mary lazarus}
<D>__{you're a ringer. she brought you in to replace me. out with the old.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{hold on.}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{mary clarence, could you? mary lazarus, you're terrific, but...}
<P>__{(to christy)}
<D>__{could you help us?}
<C>__{another nun}
<D>__{please?}
<C>__{another nun}
<D>__{you've heard us.}
<C>__{mary lazarus}
<D>__{well.}
<A>__{everyone falls silent. mary lazarus walks across the room, eyeballing each member of the choir.}
<C>__{mary lazarus}
<D>__{there's a word for this mutiny.}
<P>__{(to christy)}
<D>__{so, mary clarence, you think you can do better. i believe i'd like to see that.}
<P>__{(she hands christy her pitchpipe and baton)}
<D>__{i'm out to pasture. dry dock. the glue factory. go ahead, sister make 'em sing.}
<A>__{everyone watches christy.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{well...}
<P>__{(to nary lazarus)}
<D>__{with all due respect... let's have a look at this.}
<A>__{christy goes over to the piano. she examines the sheet music for "let they thoughts he guided." she sits at the piano, beside sister alma. christy picks out the hymn on the piano, accompanying herself.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{let thy thoughts be guided let thy soul be healed}
<A>__{christy's singing voice is, as usual, not very good. she stops singing. for perhaps the first time in her life, she has really heard herself.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{man. i sound like you guys.}
<C>__{mary lazarus}
<P>__{(victorious)}
<D>__{very nice. sisters, have we learned our lesson? i won't hold this little episode against anyone. i will try not to.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{mary robert.}
<A>__{mary robert jumps, startled by the attention.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{mary robert, i've watched you. you never really sing. you whisper. nothing comes out.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{i don't want to mess anyone up...}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(to sister alma)}
<D>__{give me a c.}
<P>__{(because sister alma is hard of hearing)}
<D>__{a c!}
<A>__{sister alma plays the note. christy points the baton at mary robert. mary robert whispers the note.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{louder! like you're onstage.}
<A>__{mary robert sings a little louder.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{like people are eating, and there's silverware, and you want them to hear you.}
<A>__{mary robert sings louder still.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{think about that guy you were dancing with!}
<A>__{mary robert finally lets out her full voice, which is huge and glorious. after singing a single perfect note, she stops abruptly; she has scared herself.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{oh my!}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{you see? we've got the voices. they're just allover the place. i've heard all of you, in the shower you're decent. better than me. we just need charts harmony chops.}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{chops?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{the goods. the sound. the sale. let's rearrange a few things. mary patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto. get over here. mary robert with the sopranos.}
<A>__{the two nuns trade places.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{sister alma a c.}
<A>__{sister alma plays the note, and the nuns try to duplicate it, but the results aren't much better than before. christy uses her pitchpipe; she circulates among the nuns, giving each her note, urging them closer to pitch.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{middle section, hold that note, for dear life. sopranos, an a. sister alma?}
<A>__{sister alma hits the note. christy shuffles a couple of more nuns to other sections, then gets a third note going with the altos, using her pitchpipe. for one moment, the nuns all realize they are singing a perfect chord. they are elated.}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{we did it! we actually sang a chord!}
<C>__{mary robert}
<P>__{(thrilled and disconcerted)}
<D>__{that was exciting!}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{yeah, for one second. that was the blend you've got to listen to each other. be a group.}
<C>__{mary lazarus}
<P>__{(under her breath)}
<D>__{i knew that.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{mary lazarus, i get the feeling that you like discipline. hard work.}
<C>__{mary lazarus}
<D>__{of course. i'm a nun. four popes now. the lord hates a loafer.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{i hear you. how many days a week do you rehearse?}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{two days. an hour or so.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{no way. we're a choir, right? headliners. the big room. two days a week won't cut it. every day.}
<C>__{mary lazarus}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{she's good.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<P>__{(to christy)}
<D>__{do you really think we could do it? get better?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{i don't know. mary lazarus, what do you think? they're pretty raw.}
<C>__{mary lazarus}
<D>__{wet behind the ears.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{a bunch of real mama's girls.}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{oh, please? can't we try?}
<A>__{christy and mary lazarus look at each other, as real comrades. christy leans on mary lazarus' shoulder.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{it'll be hell.}
<C>__{mary lazarus}
<D>__{tell me about it.}
<A>__{christy and mary lazarus shake hands, firmly. christy turns to the choir, very businesslike.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{ten hut!}
