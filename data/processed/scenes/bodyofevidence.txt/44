<L>__{interior courtroom later day}
<A>__{mccurdy is on the witness stand. cardenas stands before him.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{doctor mccurdy, what was the cause of death?}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{a massive cardiac arrest.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what was mr. marsh's physical condition prior to his death?}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{very poor. he was suffering from severe arterial disease.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{was the heart attack the result of natural causes?}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what induced it?}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{we found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{so, mr. marsh used cocaine?}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{i don't think so. the membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{then how did it get into his body?}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{we found a bottle of dristan nasal spray on the nightstand. it was filled with water and cocaine. mr. marsh had a head cold at the time of his death. i believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.}
<A>__{cardenas holds up a bottle of nasal spray in a plastic bag. he brings it over to mccurdy.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<P>__{(examines it)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{your honor, the state enters this evidence as exhibit a.}
<P>__{(to mccurdy)}
<D>__{were any fingerprints found on the bottle?}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{yes those of mr. marsh and a thumb print of miss lawson's.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{dr. mccurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in mr. marsh's condition?}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{increase his heart rate.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{ and if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{it would be an added stress to his heart.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to mr. marsh and then induced him to make love?}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{it would be the same as shooting a gun at him.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{thank you, doctor mccurdy.}
<P>__{(to dulaney)}
<D>__{your witness.}
<A>__{rebecca looks at dulaney for his opinion of mccurdy's testimony. dulaney gives her a reassuring glance before he stands up and approaches mccurdy.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{can you say with any certainty that mr. marsh didn't ingest the cocaine himself?}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{no but it seems highly unlikely that a man in his condition would use cocaine.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{that's your opinion, doctor but i'm asking you if there is any scientific test that can tell who actually put the cocaine into the dristan bottle?}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{thank you.}
