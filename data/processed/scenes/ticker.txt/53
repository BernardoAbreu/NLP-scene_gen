<L>__{interior police headquarters morning}
<A>__{a strange, uncomfortable silence hangs over the squad room as reilly weaves past cops smoking, drinking coffee, waiting. they all stare at him. especially pluchinsky.}
<L>__{interior winters' office morning}
<A>__{reilly walks in. winters gestures for him to take a seat as he talks on the phone.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{yes ... no, of course not but ... yes, sir, i understand.}
<A>__{winters hangs up.}
<C>__{winters }
<D>__{i got a call from upstairs. they say you questioned the girl.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{she's refused to say a word to anyone. what made you think you could get her to talk?}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{i didn't. but i had to try.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{reilly, i think i've shown that i'm a patient man. rice was your biggest fan and i've tried to honor him by giving you some slack. but you are very close to running out of slack.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{winters lets this sink in, then holds up reilly's report.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{i read your report. impressive. i'd say it's got detective written all over it. but... you cross the line one more time... you're gone. are we clear?}
<A>__{reilly, nods, shifts uncomfortably.}
<C>__{winters }
<D>__{now, that out of the way. the girl wants to talk to you, alone.}
<A>__{reilly is shocked.}
<C>__{winters }
<D>__{so get going, let's close this thing.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{reilly bolts off.}
