<L>__{exterior narrow street, the ghetto, rome. morning.}
<A>__{ripley comes through a dark tunnel in the ghetto on his scooter. he drives past a furniture store, dressing tables and mirrors spilling out onto the street. he glances sideways, sees his reflection fractured into several images and, for an instant, it seems as if dickie's there watching him. ripley screams and swerves, crashing into the pavement, the scooter falling onto him and pulling him along the cobbled passage. the man he thought to be dickie, an italian, runs up concerned.}
