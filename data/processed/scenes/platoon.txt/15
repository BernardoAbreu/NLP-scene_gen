<L>__{exterior platoon perimeter #1 chris' foxhole dusk}
<A>__{elsewhere, chris scrapes out a foxhole, his shirt off, bandana around his head, the work hot and heavy. tex is out there setting the claymore as big harold and junior start breaking down their c's.}
<C>__{junior}
<P>__{(a whining high voice)}
<D>__{hey big harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.}
<C>__{big harold}
<P>__{(laughes loudly)}
<D>__{fuck you bitch.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{c'mon man, didn't i do you right that time i give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.}
<C>__{big harold}
<D>__{tricky bitch, reason you gimme dat turkey loaf is nobody else can eat that shit 'cept me so don't start your game playing with me junior.}
<A>__{they're both black, junior with huge goggle eyes and a face of pimples and pockmarks, his teeth yellowed and decayed, some of them missing. harold is about twice his size, about 250 pounds, a baby huey concentrating real hard on preparing his stove to eat with.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{youse a pig man. i hope manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.}
<C>__{big harold}
<D>__{de fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{he's a fool alright but you a bigger fool. hey, whiteboy, watcha waiting for dat hole ain't gonna dig itself ...}
<A>__{chris looks up, continues working, as junior chuckles.}
<C>__{junior }
<D>__{hey taylor, you don't know it but i saved your ass today. i killed a shit eating dog.}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<C>__{big harold}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{that reminds me, i gotta take a shit.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{you gonna wipe your ass dis time?}
<C>__{big harold}
<D>__{yeah if you let me have your shirt.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(voice over, as he digs)}
<D>__{somebody once wrote hell is the impossibility of reason. that's what this place feels like. i hate it already and it's only been a week. some goddamn week, grandma ...}
<P>__{(checking his raw blisters)}
<D>__{... the hardest thing i think i've ever done is to go on point, 3 times this week i don't even know what i'm doing. a gook could be standing 3 feet in front of me and i wouldn't know it, i'm so tired. we get up at 5 a.m., hump all day, camp around 4 or 5 p.m., dig foxhole, eat, then put out an all night ambush or a 3 man listening post in the jungle. it's scary cause nobody tells me how to do anything cause i'm new and nobody cares about the new guys, they don't even want to know your name. the unwritten rule is a new guy's life isn't worth as much cause he hasn't put his time in yet and they say if you're gonna get killed in the nam it's better to get it in the first few weeks, the logic being: you don't suffer that much. i can believe that ... if you're lucky you get to stay in the perimeter at night and then you pull a 3 hour guard shift, so maybe you sleep 3 4 hours a night, but you don't really sleep ... i don't think i can keep this up for a year, grandma i think i've made a big mistake coming here ...}
<A>__{as he speaks, we cut around to various shots of the platoon members on the perimeter shaving, eating, cooking, playing, etc}
