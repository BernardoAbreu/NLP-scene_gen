<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{the food is half consumed. gekko addresses the union leaders.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{look, i have no illusions about winning a popularity contest with any of you. i was roasted the other night, and a friend of mine asked why are we honoring this man have we run out of human beings?}
<A>__{his joke breaks the ice; they laugh, except for carl.}
<C>__{gekko }
<D>__{it's not always the most popular guy who gets the job done. you got losses of 20 to 30 million dollars, dividends cut to zero, you're getting squeezed to death by the majors. present management may not be the worst scum of the earth, but they're the ones who've put you on a kamikaze course, and pretty soon everybody's going to be scrambling for the parachutes. only there aren't enough to go around. management has them. you don't. if they throw bluestar into chapter 11 which i think they will then they can use bankruptcy laws to break your unions and your contracts and throw you guys off the property.}
<A>__{we hear a loud crunching sound as bud's father bites into a roll, glaring at gekko.}
<C>__{wilmore}
<P>__{(pilot)}
<D>__{with all due respect, mr. gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{cause i have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. what do you say we cut to the chase. i'm asking for a modest twenty percent across the board wage cut.}
<A>__{carl drops his fork on the plate. gekko goes on.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{and seven more hours a month.}
<A>__{toni carpenter and duncan wilmore exchange questionable looks.}
<C>__{carpenter}
<D>__{what kind of time frame are we talking about here?}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{give me a year. if we're still losing money, the reductions stand. if however, we move into the black, i return part of the givebacks, salaries go back to present levels, and...}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{we institute an employee profit sharing program with stock. you'll own part of the airline.}
<A>__{carpenter and wilmore react with surprise, it's obvious they weren't expecting the profit sharing part. bud smiles at darien and looks to his father, who examines a sushi roll before putting it back.}
<C>__{wilmore}
<D>__{are you prepared to put that in writing?}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{i will have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.}
<C>__{carpenter}
<D>__{what's your marketing strategy? how do you plan to return us to profitability?}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{why don't i give bud an opportunity to answer that.}
<A>__{darien and carl turn to bud, who puts down his wine glass.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{thank you mr. gekko. first of all i want you to know my door will always be open to you cause i know from my dad it's you guys that keep bluestar flying. one modernize. our computer software is weak, we update it, we squeeze every dollar out of each seat and mile flown. you don't sell a seat to a guy for $89 when he's willing to pay $389. effective inventory management through computerization will increase our load factor by 5 to 20%, that translates to approximately 50 to 200 million dollars in revenues; the point is, we can beat the majors at a price war. two advertising more, more, and aggressive, attack the majors. three expand our hubs to atlanta, north carolina and dallas, reorganize all our feeder schedules, think big guys, we're going after the majors!}
<A>__{the men are visibly shaken by bud's determination.}
<C>__{gekko}
<P>__{(looking for reactions)}
<D>__{cards are on the table. what do you think?}
<C>__{wilmore}
<P>__{(restrained, hopeful)}
<D>__{if you mean what you say, i think we're in the ball park. i will take it to my people.}
<C>__{carpenter}
<P>__{(approvingly)}
<D>__{you've sketched some broad strokes. i'd like to see the fine printerior but so far so good.}
<A>__{gekko looks to carl fox who, putting down knife and fork, breaks his silence.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i guess if a man lives long enough, he gets to see everything. and i mean everything. what else do you have in your bag of tricks, mr. gekko?}
<A>__{bud tenses, looking at his father. gekko ignores the innuendo and replies softly.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{frankly, carl, i can't see giving much more. if you have any suggestions i will be glad to listen.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{there came into egypt a pharoah who did not know.}
<C>__{gekko}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i beg your pardon. is that a proverb?}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{no, it's a prophecy. the rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. the only difference between the pyramids and the empire state building is that the egyptians didn't have unions.}
<P>__{(looking at wilmore and carpenter)}
<D>__{i know what this guy is about greed he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. he don't give a damn about northstar or us ...}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{now, wait a minute, dad...}
<C>__{gekko}
<P>__{(shrugs, keeping his composure)}
<D>__{sure. what's worth doing is worth doing for money. it's a bad bargain where nobody gains. and if this deal goes through, we all gain.}
<A>__{carl throws down his napkin, rises from the chair, looks at the others.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(looks at bud)}
<D>__{'course my son did work three summers as a baggage handler and freight loader. with those qualifications, why should i doubt his ability to run an airline?}
<A>__{there is frozen silence at the table.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management dedicated to running you and bluestar into the ground.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum i will take one over a rat any day...}
<A>__{carl turns and leaves. bud glances at gekko, reading his piercing look. he hurries after his father.}
