<A>__{bud swims clear, diving down at an angle along the wall, hoping to stay in coffey's blind area. flatbed backs out of the wreckage in a cloud of debris. it pivots toward bud. moves after him. nearby, the rov is whining mindlessly, trying to please. trying to go. detail of rope attached to wreckage, as bud's knot begins to slip. the nylon line starts to play through the knot slowly. bud has gotten himself into a bad position. along the bare rock face of the cliff wall he is naked, nailed in the spotlights like a rabbit in front of a truck. coffey puts the hammer down, thrust levers all the way forward. flatbed surges forward, multi limbed and demonic. there's no cover, side to side, up or down. coffey has him head in his lights. suddenly a bright glare blasts in, blinding coffey. he looks up to see cab one rushing down upon him, full throttle. at the last moment lindsey slams the thrusters full lock and the submersible slews sideways, slamming its heavy skidplate into flatbed's cab. coffey is smashed sideways by the shock. he fights to control his vehicle. lindsey looks up to see coffey's sub gun it up over the wall, out of sight. she cruises up over bud.}
