<A>__{the soldiers look over disinterestedly. two dozen cases of coca cola are tied to a stretcher among stacks of guns. as price settles in for the ride, he begins pulling cameras from his bag. quickly and automatically, rarely looking, he switches lenses, loads film, and prepares his cameras. he has done this a thousand times. a single white soldier oates, rises from among the blacks, and shakily makes his way toward price. a mercenary dressed in a ragged uniform of his own design, carries two machine guns and a .45. he smiles broadly, recognizing price. hodge slaps price's hands as if they were teammates.}
