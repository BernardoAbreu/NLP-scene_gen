<B>__{white screen}
<A>__{which transforms to a milky white and eventually into a bright high noon sun. a large black bird flies in circles overhead. as it wipes the sun a bright flare causes... closeup pair of eyes to squint, then adjust to the light and finally open. they look tired, but content, maybe even relaxed. closeup man the owner of the eyes. though we only see from his shoulders to the top of his head, we can tell he's lying in a field. his arm is propped behind his head as a pillow and he appears to be resting comfortably. muffled voices and whispers fill the air but they seem to come from another place. the man doesn't notice them. his name is butch. a gust of wind blows butch's hair a bit and a piece of straw wipes across his forehead. then, oddly enough, it is followed by a dollar bill, which rests against his cheek, then skitters across his face. it is followed by another and another, a five, a ten, a single. butch pays no attention. he's in another world.}

<C>__{sally}
<D>__{the idea is that an understanding of the particular behavioral case histories should, in parole situations, help the subject to avoid habitual traps and, in penal escape situations could, conversely, identify those self same traps as an aide to apprehension.}

<D>__{in the first place, miss gerber.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{sally, please.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{in the first place, sally, it ain't a 'penal escape situation.' it's a manhunt. fancy words in a circle don't help much.}

<C>__{red}
<D>__{that's all i've got but i'd like to introduce ya' to miss sally gerber. she's straight from the governor's office. knows all about psychological profiles and the like. you probably have some questions for her.}
<A>__{red steps back and to one side. sally is taken aback but then warms to the idea and steps to the podium for her first press conference, ready to take on the tough questions, to show off a bit, but.... there are no questions. in fact there is utter silence as every raised hand drops. eyes stare. red sighs and starts to walk away.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{look, fellas, i got work to do.}
<A>__{and he heads out the door, followed by sally's eyes and every reporter's in the room, who commence once again to yell out questions and mob after the chief. every reporter, that is, except one. he's near the back of the room and he smiles and raises his hand. sally, unsure what to do, looks to him...}

<P>__{(to red)}

<A>__{sally arrives but before she can spit out a word...}

<D>__{not a scratch, you hear me, suttle? not a scratch!}
<A>__{saunders stops, breathing hard, next to sally. she's pissed and overloaded with files.}
<B>__{airstream}
<A>__{about 20 yards down the way, comes to a stop. a second later the door opens and the steps pop out. sally walks toward the bus but when she arrives at the door... ... laughter filters out of the airstream. the airstream moves another 20 feet then stops. sally waits a full five seconds, then she blows the hair out of her eyes and, against her better judgment, moves cautiously forward, the file boxes getting heavier by the minute. again, when she gets close... ...the airstream moves. sally, boiling mad as her coiffure wilts in the texas sun, stops, and tosses down the file box in anger. the airstream stops. laughter from inside and a few ad libs, i.e. "okay, okay." more laughter. red steps out the door, turns his gaze back inside and the laughter and comments stop on a dime. smiling slightly he turns to sally, moves straight for the file box, picks it up and walks back to the airstream. when he arrives at the steps he turns, looks to sally, who stews and holds her ground.}

<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i've got it.}
<A>__{she kneels down to pick it up and feels eyes on her. she looks up to the men staring at... her skirt, raised a bit, exposing a thigh. she calmly stands and looks to adler, a piece of cinnamon roll dangling on his chin.}
