<A>__{the theme from "mighty mouse" begins playing. then, andy strides in, a sneer on his grungy face. the crowd screams and boos pure pile. andy is euphoric, loving the hatred. down in the front row sit stanley, janice, zmuda, and lynne. several photographers take pictures of the parents. they squint, unused to all this. andy prances into the ring. he takes the mike.}
