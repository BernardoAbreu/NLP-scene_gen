<A>__{sweat is running down cameron's face. finally, with dread...}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{that crack...in the windshield...}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{what about it? probably from the impact. no water coming in.}
<A>__{cameron's face reflects immense relief. at least he's not guilty of that. the flung stone was not the cause. now, abruptly, burt's body begins to move more violently.}
<C>__{chuck's voice}
<D>__{there! look at that. he's starting to panic. will you, for christ's sake, tell me why?}
<A>__{as chuck slows the film, we see burt's head duck beneath the view of the underwater camera, leaving only the steering wheel and windshield. for an instant, the current changes the light and the crack glows brightly, like a spider web. burt reappears, his face now toward camera, wild with terror. the slow motion lends a bizarre elegance to his agony. abruptly, the film goes black.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{shit. that's where it stops. that fuckin' henry...got spooked and took his finger off the remote button.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{is this how the story was supposed to end, with the flyer dying in the water?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{sure as shit ended that way for burt, didn't it?}
