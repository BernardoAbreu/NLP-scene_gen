<L>__{interior william's hotel room night}
<A>__{stillwater's "fever dog" plays from the t.v. radio. william on the bed, a thick local phone book on his lap. his hotel room. he watches self consciously as the girls go about the ritual of inhabiting a room on the road. sapphire flutters a paisley scarf over the room lamp. polexia puts a towel along the crack of the door, blows out the glowing embers on too many sticks of incense, and moves to the phone. estrella has joined them as well, complete with a bag full of shoes. instantly, we have atmosphere and not much room left in this, the smallest room in the hotel. william thumbs through the phone book with fascination.}
