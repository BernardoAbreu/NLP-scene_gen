<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior cell area. day.}
<A>__{a guard exits pushing a cart of food trays. nancy waits warily until he's gone, then looks back to rod lane. rod looks more like a captured coyote than a human; haggard, ribbed, expecting poisoned bait. his hair is wet, his clothes are borrowed jeans and work shirt.}
<C>__{nancy}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{and then what happened?}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{i told you.}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}
<D>__{it was dark, but i'm sure there was someone else in there, under the covers with her.}
<A>__{nancy reacts.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{how could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{how the fuck do i know?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't expect you to believe me.}
<A>__{nancy studies his encrypted eyes. surprisingly, she looks like she just might believe him. she leans closer with a new thought.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{what he look like? you get a look at him?}
<A>__{he looks away.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{well then how can you say somebody else was there?}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{because somebody cut her. while i watched.}
<A>__{now the place is so quiet you can hear heartbeats.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{somebody cut her while you watched and you don't know what he looked like?}
<A>__{rod smiles an insane smile, stuck with a reality no one will buy.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{you couldn't see the fucker. you could just see the cuts happening, all at once.}
<A>__{nancy gives a twitch.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{what you mean 'all at once'?}
<C>__{rod}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{i mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. but invisible razors. she just... opened up...}
<A>__{by now he's picking at a clot of dark blood on his jacket, as if it was a scab on his own body. then he catches nancy watching and turns away to the back of the cell. he smashes his fist into the wall bone crushing blows that scare the wits out of}
<B>__{nancy.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{rod!}
<A>__{he stops, and his fist is dripping blood as he says in a small, sad voice.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{i probably could've saved her if i'd moved sooner... but i thought it was just another nightmare, like the one i had the night before.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there... was this guy who had knives for fingers...}
<A>__{close on nancy, unable to swallow the gorge rising in her throat. rod turns to her, and to his surprise she's ashen.}
<C>__{rod }
<D>__{do you think i did it?}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{no.}
