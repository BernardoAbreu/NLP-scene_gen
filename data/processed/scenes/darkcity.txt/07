<A>__{white pushes shakily through a red door, runs down a corridor. pipes steam and drip water. he rounds a corner, slips, nearly falls.}

<A>__{he looks up, wipes his mouth on his sleeve. a breeze tugs at his stringy hair. a tiny ventilation grill above the cistern looks out at the street. his p.o.v. outside sheets of newspaper blow past. a full moon, surrounded by blood red clouds, hangs above empty streets.}
