<A>__{carla walks along the road in the dark, stumbling along.}
<L>__{interior guido's suite night}
<A>__{guido enters. the two single beds. luisa is apparently asleep in hers. guido sits on his bed. glum.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{apparently she's staying in some grotesque pensione next to the station.}
<A>__{luisa doesn't move.}
<C>__{guido }
<D>__{luisa, if i'd invited her here, she would be staying in the hotel, wouldn't she? think about it. i didn't even know you were coming.}
<C>__{luisa}
<P>__{(without opening her eyes)}
<D>__{very plausible.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{because it's true.}
<A>__{luisa turns on her bedside lamp and sits up in bed.}
<C>__{luisa}
<D>__{you told me it was finished.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{it is. look, she was worried about me, she came to see if i was all right which yes, is stupid but not, as far as i know, a crime, and hardly a mortal sin.}
<A>__{luisa suddenly laughs, disconcertingly.}
<C>__{guido }
<P>__{(smiles, insecure)}
<D>__{what? what are you laughing about?}
<C>__{luisa}
<D>__{nothing. if you could see yourself.}
<P>__{(raising herself up further)}
<D>__{i couldn't live with it the absurdity of being you, the effort of having to hide and lie and cheat. it's exhausting, no wonder you've got no script, you're too busy inventing your own life.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{it's finished. it's finished.}
<P>__{(and he is exhausted)}
<D>__{if it wasn't before, it is now.}
<C>__{luisa}
<P>__{(lying back on her bed)}
<D>__{blah blah blah blah blah.}
<A>__{luisa turns over, reaches to the bedside lamp and turns it off. guido gets up and hurries from the room.}
