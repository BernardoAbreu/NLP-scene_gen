<A>__{ambrose standing before hunt with a pair of fully loaded berettas. the sound of the helicopter grows.}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{ right. we don't have a lot of time, hunt. whatever you've got to say, say it now.}
<A>__{ethan indeed makes some considerable effort to speak but can only manage a few guttural, progressively desperate sounds which continue as:}
<C>__{ambrose }
<D>__{sorry mate, i can't understand a bloody word. how about giving us a big smile to remember you by?}
<P>__{(hearing the helicopter)}
<D>__{no? well, then. this is what's known as getting your gun off.}
<A>__{with that ambrose empties thirty four rounds from the two berettas into ethan whose body jerks crazily on the floor. mccloy nearly faints, and ambrose laughs at his squeamishness until something on ethan's body catches his eye: the top of the little finger on the right hand is bleeding. ambrose grabs ethan's face, and rips off a latex mask: revealing stamp, eyes wide open and thoroughly lifeless. his jaw, under the mask had been taped carefully close with the same heavy tape ethan has used to mount the drain pipe shotgun on the tunnel wall.}
<C>__{ambrose }
<D>__{bloody hell!}
<A>__{he looks around, but stamp is gone. so is the cannister and kevlar vest that had been on the table moments before.}
