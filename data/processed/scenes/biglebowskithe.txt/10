<T>__{at length:}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{...also, my rug was stolen.}
<C>__{younger cop}
<D>__{your rug was in the car.}
<A>__{the dude taps the floor with his foot.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{no. here.}
<C>__{younger cop}
<D>__{separate incidents?}
<A>__{the dude stares at the floor. silence.}
<C>__{older cop}
<D>__{snap out of it, son.}
<A>__{the home phone starts ringing a ring distinct from the chirp of the portable. the dude makes no move to answer it. finally the rings stop as an answering machine kicks on.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{you find them much? stolen cars?}
<A>__{dude's voice on machine the dude's not in. leave a message after the beep. it takes a minute.}
<C>__{younger cop}
<D>__{sometimes. i wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though. or the creedence tapes.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{and the, uh, the briefcase?}
<A>__{beep.}
<C>__{female voice on machine}
<D>__{mr. lebowski, i'd like to see you. call when you get home and i will send a car for you. my name is maude lebowski. i'm the woman who took the rug.}
<A>__{beep. dial tone.}
<C>__{older cop}
<D>__{well, i guess we can close the file on that one.}
<B>__{tracking forward}
<A>__{we are moving through the open living area of a large downtown l.a. loft. a huge unfinished canvas, lit by standing industrial lights, dominates one wall. the furnishings are spare given the space. on the floor is the dude's brilliant rug. we hear a rumble like an approaching bowling ball. the dude, standing in the middle of the loft, looks into the murky depths of the cavernous space. something huge and white hurtles towards the dude's head. as it roars overhead he ducks, and spins to watch it pass. we see the backside of a naked woman in a sling suspended from a ceiling track rumbling over a canvas that lies on the floor. she is holding a paint bucket in one hand and a brush in the other, with which she flicks paint down at the canvas. the dude turns again as he hears running footsteps. two young men in paint spattered shorts, t shirts and sneakers reach the sling shortly after it reaches the end of its track and haul it back for another push.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i will be with you in a minute, mr. lebowski.}
<A>__{she rumbles by in another pass. all right, we'll do the blue tomorrow. elfranco. pedro. help me down. the two men help maude out of her sling. she is naked except for leather harness straps which ring her breasts and wrap her thighs and give her something of a dominatrix look. does the female form make you uncomfor table, mr. lebowski?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{is that what that's a picture of?}
<C>__{maude}
<D>__{in a sense, yes. elfranco, my robe. my art has been commended as being strongly vaginal. which bothers some men. the word itself makes some men uncomfortable. vagina.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{oh yeah?}
<C>__{maude}
<D>__{yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say. whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "johnson".}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{"johnson"?}
<C>__{maude}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{this to elfranco, who has handed her a robe. all right, mr. lebowski, let's get down to cases. my father told me he's agreed to let you have the rug, but it was a gift from me to my late mother, and so was not his to give. now. as for this. . . "kidnapping" }
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{maude}
<D>__{yes, i know about it. and i know that you acted as courier. and let me tell you something: the whole thing stinks to high heaven.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{right, but let me explain something about that rug }
<C>__{maude}
<D>__{do you like sex, mr. lebowski?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{maude}
<D>__{sex. the physical act of love. coitus. do you like it?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{i was talking about my rug.}
<C>__{maude}
<D>__{you're not interested in sex?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{you mean coitus?}
<C>__{maude}
<D>__{i like it too. it's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. it can be a natural, zesty enterprise. but unfortunately there are some people it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women who engage in it compulsively and without joy.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{oh, no.}
<C>__{maude}
<D>__{yes mr. lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word. our mutual acquaintance bunny is one of these.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{listen, maude, i'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but i don't see what it has to do with do you have any kalhua?}
<C>__{maude}
<D>__{take a look at this, sir.}
<A>__{she is aiming a remote at a projection tv. the screen flickers to life. a title card:}
