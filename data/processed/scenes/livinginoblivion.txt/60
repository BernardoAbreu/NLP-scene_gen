<L>__{interior bathroom. day}
<A>__{nick intently scrutinizes himself in the mirror. leaning closer he makes a careful adjustment to the way his hair falls over his ear, then steps back to examine himself.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{would you care to have a drink tonight? hey, nicole, what do you say you and i have a drink tonight?}
<A>__{suddenly the door opens behind him and nicole walks in.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{oh, nick! i'm sorry!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{that's ok, no problem. i'm just slapping a little water on my face.}
<A>__{the two stand in embarrassed silence for a moment. nick looks like he's gathering the nerve to ask her out.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{so, it's going pretty good, huh?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{is it? something feels off.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yeah, you seem a little tense.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{do i?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{but don't worry about it. just take your attention off yourself and put it on chad. work off him a little more.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{ok, i will try that.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{and listen, i know he's no olivier. but he's got something, don't you think? kind of a natural presence.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{oh yes, he's very natural.}
<A>__{nick hesitates, again gathering his nerves to pop the question.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{so nicole... anything else i can help you with?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{actually there is. could you maybe ask him to brush his teeth?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{oh, sure.}
