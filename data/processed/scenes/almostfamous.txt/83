<A>__{it's raining. the pre show huddle breaks up, william a part of them. penny lane adjusts larry's look. she takes the scarf from around his neck and ties it around his leg. he looks instantly better. william watches in the darkness as dick takes the microphone. the best part of his day has arrived. in his important voice:}

<D>__{good evening phoenix.}
<P>__{(applause)}
<D>__{from troy, michigan. please welcome, stillwater.}
<A>__{lights come up, as the band launches into "fever dog." jeff begins singing. russell reaches to adjust the microphone for a back up vocal and is hit with something unexpected. a sharp electrical shock. it's just a slight pop in the loud din of music, but within a moment something is clearly wrong. russell holds onto the microphone stand with a surprised look, conducting high voltage for two seconds and then he snaps his hand off the metal. his face is white, he takes off his guitar and walks off stage, collapsing a couple steps later.}
