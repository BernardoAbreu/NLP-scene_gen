<L>__{exterior clark secondary soon after}
<A>__{they drive up to clark secondary. there is a giant sign that reads "seniors two glorious weeks until graduation". seth turns into the staff parking lot.}
<L>__{int exterior 7 11 store moments later}
<A>__{seth and evan walk past a group of smokers, towards the 7 11.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{you're being an idiot, man. you really shouldn't park there.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{fuck it. i'm a senior about to graduate. they should be suckin' my balls. it's the least they can do for stealing three years of my life.}
<A>__{they walk past dimitri (18, big native american guy) as they enter the store. dimitri aggressively bumps his shoulder into seth.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{what the hell's wrong with dimitri?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{oh, yeah dude, i forgot to tell you. i knocked the fuckin' shit out of him in capture the flag last week.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{good! 9th grade camp he gave me whiplash in "king of the ring." i fucking hate that guy.}
<A>__{they go to the magazine rack and stare at a maxim cover.}
<C>__{evan }
<D>__{look at those nipples.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{they're like baby toes.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{it's not fair. i have to hide every erection i get.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{sometimes i get boners so big i can't hide them. and then i get nervous and my heart starts pounding, and it all just, like, feeds my boner. it just becomes this...thing...that's attached to me. and it won't go away.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{just imagine if girls weren't weirded out by our boners and they actually wanted to see `em, like this shit.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you know it's been, like, a year and a half since i've seen an actual human female nipple. besides my mom's. i saw it last month, and it was sick.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{holy shit. liat was two years ago? i guess so. she was insanely hot, though.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{exactly. too hot. that's what sucks.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{how can that possibly suck? i'd be fuckin' psyched if i'd gotten with a girl that hot. you got, like, two dozen handjobs!}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{and three quarters of a blowjob, but that was fuckin' it. it was the peak of my ass gettin' career, and it happened way, way, way too early.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{you're like orson welles.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{exactly! if i'd built up to it, i'd probably at least be having steady sex with a mediocre looking girl at this pointerior i honestly now see why orson welles ate his fat ass to death.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{you'll have sex in college. everyone does. and if not, you'll have the bang bus.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{but the key is to be good at sex by the time you're in college. you don't want girls to think you suck dick at fucking.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i still think you've got a chance with jules. she got mad hot over last summer, and clearly hasn't realized it, `cause she still flirts with you.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{are you joking, man? let's see here...she dated dan remick, matt muir, josh corber and what's his face. all of those were cool guys. she's been hot way longer than you think. why would she end her high school career with me?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{well, helen got with ariel shafir.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{yeah, and he was a complete fucking loser. you're a step up from that. which is why you should stop being a pussy and do her! you could nailthe shit out of her for, like, two months before you leave. that bitch looks like a good fucker.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{hey! i'm sick of you talking about her like that, man!}
<A>__{evan starts to walk out. seth follows.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{what, you can talk about that bitch all day every single day, but i can't say one thing about her?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i don't constantly insult her.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i didn't insult her! i said she looks like a good fucker! she looks like she can take a dick. that's a good thing. some women pride themselves on their dick taking abilities.}
