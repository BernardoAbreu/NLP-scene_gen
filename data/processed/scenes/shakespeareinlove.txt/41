<A>__{will has got in with the musicians. competently enough he strums along with them on the bandstand. two dozen guests are enough to crowd the space for dancing. will glances around, looking for thomas kent. he stops a passing servant, helping himself to a snack off the man's tray.}
<C>__{servant}
<D>__{musicians don't eat, sir robert's orders.}

<C>__{sir robert}
<D>__{she is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.}
<C>__{wessex}
<D>__{my plantations in virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. i have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a wessex. is she fertile?}
<C>__{sir robert}
<D>__{she will breed. if she do not, send her back.}
<C>__{wessex}
<D>__{is she obedient?}
<C>__{sir robert}
<D>__{as any mule in christendom. but if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.}
<C>__{wessex}
<D>__{i like her.}
<A>__{angle on will watching the dancing. then he sees viola in the crowd. he turns to blood. love at first sight, no doubt about it. viola has not seen him. she is doing a daughter's duty among her parents' friends. the guests form up to begin a changing partners dance (the very same one you get in every romeo and juliet).}

<C>__{musician}
<D>__{viola de lesseps. dream on, will.}
<A>__{will leaves the bandstand and is moving trancelike to keep her in view between the dancers and onlookers. viola moves through patterns of the dance until...as night follows day, she finds will opposite her. he has insinuated himself into the dance. viola gasps.}
<C>__{viola}
<D>__{master shakespeare}
<A>__{will reacts, surprised by her reaction. the dance separates them. viola finds herself opposite wessex.}

<A>__{will has lost his tongue.}
<C>__{viola }
<D>__{i heard you are a poet.}
<A>__{will nods in his trance and she smiles at him.}
<C>__{viola }
<D>__{but a poet of no words?}
<A>__{will tries to speak but the silver tongue won't work. he is dumb with adoration. suddenly wessex takes him affably by the elbow and leads him into an alcove.}

<D>__{how do i offend, my lord?}
<C>__{wessex}
