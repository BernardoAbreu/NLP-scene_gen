<A>__{erin bends down to help him.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{yeah. i'm probably ruining them.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{i'm never here. i gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i was serious before, you know. if you need someone to keep an eye on them after school or something i don't have a job now, so i'm around in the afternoons.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{great. another deadbeat.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i'm not a deadbeat. i work when i need to.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{yeah? and what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i do construction, which pays real good. and i make it last by living cheap.}
<C>__{erin}
<P>__{(with a little laugh)}
<D>__{i hope that's not supposed to impress me.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{it's been a while. maybe i'm just out of practice.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, i don't mind taking you up on it.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{cause i like kids. i like hanging out with them.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{she starts cleaning up the cards.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i do. i like how they keep it all simple, you know? they don't get all complicated about life, like grown ups do. a bicycle and an ice cream cone boom, done, they're happy.}
<A>__{erin thinks about the offer.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{you're around every afternoon?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yup. usually working on my bike.}
<P>__{(she's tempted)}
<D>__{no big deal. if it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.}
<A>__{tempting. erin looks him over.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{this isn't gonna get you laid, you know.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(with a laugh)}
<D>__{yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?}
