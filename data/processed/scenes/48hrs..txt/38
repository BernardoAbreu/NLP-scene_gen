<T>__{transition:}
<L>__{exterior mission district street night}
<A>__{the cadillac drives slowly past a bar called torchie's. stops at the end of the block.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{it's a long shot, but...billy used to tend bar here a few years back. i heard him talk about it.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{this part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. just back me up like you've got a piece...}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{back you up? now why would i wanna do that?}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{if they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{but you can handle it all right, huh? real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{bullshit. attitude and experience get you through...}
<A>__{cates and hammond step out, glance toward the bar.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{i been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. all those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{you need five years training to handle a joint like...}
<A>__{hamnond's had enough of this debate.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{hey, you wanna bet?}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i got two problems. number one, i'm not playin' games. number two, you got nothin' to bet with.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{if we come outta this joint with ganz' phone number, or a dead indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while i get laid...}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{why? anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{that's never been one of my problems. now, stop stallin', man, or else admit all this professional stuff you're talkin' about is a crock of shit.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i will tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{what are you talkin' about?}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{you tell me what ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail. and whatever it is, you're part of it.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about. i just wanna see ganz nailed.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{the bet's off.}
<A>__{hammond thinks it over..}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{okay, if i lose, i will tell you anything you want to know...}
<A>__{cates reaches into his pocket.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i'm gonna enjoy this ... here, i will even loan you my badge.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{i thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.}
<A>__{he takes the badge anyway as they head for the entrance. torchie's western bar they step inside. hammond reacts to...}
<B>__{redneck city}
<A>__{longhorns mounted over the bar, rebel flags, lone star beer, armadillo posters. even the waitresses wear stetsons. rockabilly pounding from the jukebox. a cowgirl stripper is doing the grind on a small podium.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{this place don't seem real popular with the brothers.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{my kind of place. i always liked country boys.}
<A>__{cates smiles, finds a table in the corner. a cowgirl comes over to take his order.}
<B>__{hammond}
<A>__{takes a deep breath, moves toward the bar. smiles at the good ol' boys. they don't smile back. he sits down at the bar.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{vodka.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{maybe you better have a black russian.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{no, man, i think i will have a vodka.}
<A>__{hamnond looks around the room.}
<B>__{the bartender}
<A>__{places a glass in front of him, picks up the dollar as harmond flashes cates' shield.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{you know a big indian named billy bear? he used to work here.}
<A>__{the bartender shakes his head, gives him a scowl.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{never heard of him.}
<A>__{hammond lifts the shot glass and throws it through the mirror behind the bar. sudden silence throughout the room.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{now how's your memory doin'?}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{fuck off. i don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{maybe i better ask around, see what your pals think.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{i don't give a shit who you ask.}
<A>__{the bartender walks down toward cates.}
<B>__{hammond}
<A>__{moves away from the bar. he stops at a booth occupied by four cowboy punks, one a very big man. hammond grabs him by the arm and pulls him up.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{up against the wall, cowboy.}
<A>__{the punk breaks free, aims a massive haymaker at hammond. gets a right to the stomach for his trouble.}
<C>__{hammond}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{now, i said get over there by that wall ... you hear me, motherfucker...}
<A>__{looks at the others.}
<C>__{hammond}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{move it, rednecks. on your feet...}
<A>__{he grabs the next by the arm, yanks him up.}
<C>__{hammond}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{over there...move your ass. some of you rednecks seem a little hard of hearing, so i will repeat it for everybody... i need word on the whereabouts of an indian that goes by the name of billy bear. it's a police matter and you all look like you'd just love to cooperate...}
<A>__{cates quietly sips his beer. the other occupants of the bar watch hammond herd the four punks to the end wall.}
<B>__{a big cowboy}
<A>__{when hammond isn't looking, he dashes toward the exit, cates puts out a leg. sends the cowboy crashing into a crowdedtable.}
<B>__{hammond}
<A>__{turns around at the noise.}
<C>__{hammond}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{that wasn't necessary, buddy. i got this under control.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{some of us citizens are with you all the way, officer.}
<A>__{the redneck punks are now spread eagled against the wall. hammond searches the first. he drops a wallet on the floor and moves to the second. a switchblade, some credit cards and another wallet fall to the floor. the last punk has only a roll of bills. hammond holds the money up to his face.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{you're in trouble, big trouble, so you better start talking. where'd a boy like you make a score like this?}
<C>__{punk}
<D>__{it's mine, what the hell...}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{you must a rolled somebody. they don't let punks like you take jobs that pay this much ... you sure you don't know a dangerous indian, because unless you start talkin' i may just have to start looking down your pants with a flashlight...}
<C>__{punk}
<D>__{what kind of cop are you, anyway?}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{i am your most terrible nightmare ... a bad nigger with a badge that entitles him to kick your ass...}
<A>__{hammond turns to the bartender...}
<C>__{hammond}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{one of them is under age. another attacked a police officer. and you know i ain't found what i came lookin' here for yet...}
<A>__{walks back to the bartender.}
<C>__{hammond}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the tall one had a weapon ... you want me to keep on makin' a list, or you got the picture yet?}
<A>__{he reaches for a towel under a pyramid of bar glasses. jerks the towel, the pyramid capsizes onto the floor. huge crash as the glasses break into a million fragments.}
<C>__{hammond}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{looks like you're on your way to bein' outta business, redneck... now, let's see what can we fuck with next?}
<A>__{the bartender doesn't have the look of a happy man.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{okay, okay. the indian hangs out with a girl down the block. right where chinatown starts. she lives on top of the hardware store.}
<A>__{hammond turns, grins at cates. as far as he's concerned, he's won the bet. cates nods, slips out the door.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{i don't give a damn about his girl...}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place. it's the only thing i know.}
<A>__{he looks desperate.}
<C>__{bartender}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i'm tellin' ya, i'm giving you all i know.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and i won't have to hassle you...}
<A>__{turns to go, then turns back.}
<C>__{hammond}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{but remember this, cowboy, there's a new sheriff in town.}
<A>__{smiles, turns and goes.}
