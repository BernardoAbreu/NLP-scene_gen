<A>__{this large highschool and its crowds of students. foreground, tina climbs out of a cherry red 1959 cadillac convertible with two other students, best friend nancy wilson, and nancy's boyfriend and owner of the car, glen lantz. foreground several gradeschoolers are playing jump rope, and the old ditty they sing continues unbroken from tina's bedroom.}
<C>__{rope jumpers}
<D>__{seven eight, gonna stay up late! nine ten never sleep again!}
<A>__{moving angle favoring nancy. she's a pretty girl in a letter sweater, with an easy, athletic stride and the look of a natural leader. glen, holding her hand, wears one of the school's football jerseys; a good natured, bright kid. tina's in mid conversation.}
<C>__{tina}
<P>__{(referring to kids' song)}
<D>__{that's what it reminded me of that old jump rope song.}

<D>__{worst nightmare i ever had. you wouldn't believe it.}
<A>__{nancy nods.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{matter of fact i had a bad dream last night myself...}
<A>__{tina turns to nancy, but before either can say more, rod lane, a lean, richard gere sort in black leather and new wave studs joins up with them and interupts.}
<C>__{rod}
<P>__{(to tina)}
<D>__{had a hardon this morning when i woke up, tina. had your name written all over it.}
<A>__{tina cracks her gum with a look of withering indifference.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{there's four letters in my name, rod. how could there be room on your joint for four letters?}
<A>__{the guy's stopped in his tracks.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{hey, up yours with a twirling lawn mower!}
<A>__{he cuts off across the lawn.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{rod says the sweetest things.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{he's nuts about you.}

<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so what you dream?}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{forget it, the point is, every body has nightmares once in a while. no biggy.}
<C>__{glen}
<D>__{next time you have one, just tell yourself that's just all it is, right while you're having it, y'know? that's the trick. once you do that, you wake right up. at least it works for me.}
<A>__{tina looks at glen sharply. he kisses nancy and darts off for class.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{hey! you have a nightmare too?}
<A>__{but glen's gone.}
<C>__{tina }
<D>__{maybe we're gonna have the big earthquake. they say things get weird just before that...}
