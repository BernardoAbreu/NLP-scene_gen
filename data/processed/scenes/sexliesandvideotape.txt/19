<L>__{interior cynthia bishop's apartment day}
<A>__{ann stands watching cynthia get dressed for work.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i don't know. he went to school here, then he was in new york for awhile, then philadelphia, and then just kind of travelling around.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{must be nice. so, what's he like, is he like john?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{no, not at all. actually, i don't think john likes him much anymore. he said he thought graham had gotten strange.}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{is he? strange, i mean?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{not really. maybe if i just saw him on the street i'd have said that, but after talking to him...he's just kind of...i don't know, unusual.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{uh huh. so what's he look like?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i just want to know what he looks like, is all.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{why, so you can go after him?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{jesus, ann, get a life. i just asked what he looked like.}
<A>__{ann says nothing.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{besides, even if i decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{do you have to say that?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{you know what. you say it just to irritate me.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i say it because it's descriptive.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{ann, you always underestimate me.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{well, i wonder why.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. i think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{oh, for god's sake. really, cynthia, really, i don't think he's your type.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{"my type"? what is this bullshit? how would you know what "my type" is?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i have a pretty good idea.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{ann, you don't have a clue. look, i don't even know why we're discussing this, i will just call him myself.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{he doesn't have a phone.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{well, i will call him when he does.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{but he won't.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{he's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{oh, please. okay,' so give me the zen master's address, i will think of a reason to stop by.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{let me talk to him first.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{why? just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{and what?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{and...do whatever it is you do.}
<A>__{cynthia laughs loudly. ann, not happy, watches her dig through the jewelry box.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{lose something?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{that goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{are you getting mom something for her birthday?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i don't know, i will get her a card or something.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{a card? for her fiftieth birthday?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{what's wrong with that?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? i mean, the woman gave birth to you. it s her fiftieth birthday }
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{will you stop? jesus.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i just thought it might }
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{okay, ann, okay. how about this: you buy her something nice, and i will pay for half. all right?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{good. now, if you'll pardon me, i have to go to work.}
