<L>__{interior situation room day}
<A>__{an unexpectedly vast semi circular room, the entire inner circum ference made up of a single continuous wall screen, separated into a seamless array of images... three dimensional rotating graphics of every room in the hancock tower penthouse, schematics of electrical, plumbing, and ventila tion systems. see through rotating multicolored models of every piece of security equipment imaginable, components flashing as performance simulations are run. rapid fire sequences of indiv idual human profiles, complete with photos and bio blurbs. screens flickering with blizzards of data, hurtling past at warp speed. the pentagon and cnn would kill for this room. the largest segment of screen, twenty feet square, runs a live feed from the crime scene. the living room of the penthouse, crawling with slow moving cops and technicians, doing their slow moving thing. surrounding this image are a dozen smaller screens, showing this and other rooms from a variety of camera angles. all live. we see the library, the mail chute. the powder room. bozo. cruz skips down three steps to floor level, nine separate control stations, each outfitted with super tech panels to process the avalanche of information. but today, all stations are empty. except one.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{baker. you got it solved?}
<A>__{and now we see her. from the rear. slouched at her station. looks like a skinny teenager in tousled tawny hair, rumpled oversized workshirt, vintage jeans.}
<P>__{gin (o.s., from the rear)}
<D>__{actually. yeh.}
<A>__{not a kid's voice. throaty. music and whiskey and sex and effortless confidence. even the voice turns us on.}
<C>__{cruz }
<D>__{what took you so long, gin? i called 4:30 this morn...}
<A>__{and stops. because she turns with a look that would freeze anyone to stone.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i was with someone, all right?}
<A>__{now we really see her. delicate bones and features, slender body, radiating the power of a natural heart stopping beauty. ginger baker is 32, ethereal and feral at once. electric green eyes crackle with an intellect and a will that are not to be fucked with.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{so? this is work.}
<A>__{he is not kidding. stainless steel beneath the dapper. they are a matched team.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{hector, i hardly know the guy. why be impolite to strangers?}
<A>__{and he smiles. maybe she's lying. he likes her.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{look at those assholes...}
<A>__{he means the cops on live feed.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{if the vermeer were lying on that table, they'd toss their doughnuts on it.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{yeh, well, they didn't insure it, so they don't have to solve this. to them it's a crime. to us it's 24 mil, less re insurance, which is...}
<C>__{cruz }
<D>__{only thirty percent, gin.}
<A>__{ouch. really?}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{which is why you're on this.}
<A>__{soft and straight. you're the best. i need you.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{he came in through the window.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{that's not possib...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{what's not possible is entry through the doors or the vents. that would have triggered instant alarm.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{the windows are wired, too.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{only for trauma. they used smart glass, where the sensors respond to violation of the panel's integrity.}
<A>__{he's listening. he always does with her.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i think he scaled the wall, popped the frame. in one piece.}
<A>__{she sounds awfully positive. then again, she always does.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{then, he only had to deal with heat and motion sensors. they were on 60 second delay, so the owner wouldn't trigger the alarm just be walking arou...}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{the pane weighs 200 pounds, the building's 1100 feet high.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{this particular guy is the best. the best there ever was.}
<A>__{almost as if she knows who. cruz shakes his head...}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{popping the frame would trigger the alarm.}
<A>__{she smiles. first time. even at one tenth power, it is dazzling light. she touches the panel before her...}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{i wrote a program and ran it, dumbo.}
<A>__{the live feed is replaced by a red outlined rotating three dimensional diagram of the living room. the alarm box glows green. one window pane glows lavender. she touches the panel, and the window shatters, the alarm instantly emits a piercing screech. reset. as he watches. this time the window slides away into thin air. no sound. a stick figure appears, crawls through the opening, and the alarm begins the slow beep we heard last night. cruz just stares.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{here's how i figured it out...}
<A>__{live feed replaces the diagram. our camera zooms toward a vase of lilies by the window. all the flowers are tilted in one direction. over the lip of the vase, away from the window.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{no one arranges flowers like that. it was the draft from the window.}
<A>__{he turns to her.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{you said. this particular guy.}
<A>__{now she is beaming. excited. and just above a whisper...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{andrew macdougal.}
<A>__{delighted at his stupefied reaction.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{why not houdini? or pretty boy floyd? maybe jesus christ.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{because they couldn't do it.}
<A>__{his slow smile. this fucking kid.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{he's been out of the business. for ten years .}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{maybe not. no one ever proved, hell, even arrested him, for stealing anything . but we all know he was numero ichiban for thirty years. why not forty?}
<A>__{she's serious.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{why? because of the bozo switch? guys have been copying his pack rat signature for decades . maybe the thief wanted it to look like macdougal.}
<A>__{she doesn't even answer. just touches her panel, and one of the data screens blows up to huge size. it is...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{a list of his private collection. complete to three acquisitions last thursday.}
<A>__{names scrolling up endlessly, next to titles, descriptions, estimated retail and black market values. turner, corot, thomas coles, dekooning, klimt, cezannes, odilon redon, braques, mary cassatt...}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{no vermeer. nothing close.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{don't be a putz. this is his legitimate collection, which he buys . presentable for any search warrant surprise party.}
<A>__{names keep rolling, degas, paul klee. amazing.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{what he rips off, he fences. and the money feeds his portfolio of investments, which are daring, savvy, and obscenely succesf...}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{oh, i get it. he has no interest in vermeers, so that proves he stole one. by that logic, he oughta be a suspect most of the time.}
<A>__{she shakes her head, sadly.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{you love to embarrass yourself.}
<A>__{touches her panel. the big screen now shows a grainy videotape of...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{the auction. where our client bought the painting...}
<A>__{we see the great room of an english country estate. perhaps a hundred attend. genteel to the max.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{ashcroft hall, buckinghamshire, four weeks ago.}
<A>__{the tape pans five paintings on the block. we recognize our vermeer, the city of delft, the canal, the bridge. the view pulls back to include the crowd, and... freezes. one tiny section is circled. and blows up twenty feet. high, so blurry as to be unrecognizable. then, snaps to amazing resolution. the image of...}
<P>__{gin (o.s., murmur)}
<D>__{anyone we know?}
<A>__{...andrew macdougal, perhaps 60, as charismatic and shamelessly virile a face as one can recall. etched with character and worldly experience, lit by a twinkle behind the razor keen gaze. tall, wide shoulders, massive hands. this guy would be more fun to fuck than fight. by a lot.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{so he was there.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{staking it out. why bid, when you can mark the buyer, and jack it within the month?}
<A>__{she leans way back in the molded chair. lifts her long legs up onto the console. they end in slender bare feet. the toes wriggle.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{at this moment, he is winging on jal flight 307 to narita, ostensibly to attend a prestigious auction at the hotel akura, which will include a mixed media collage oil by georges braques, on which he supposedly has his eye.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{but you know better.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{bet your ass. at vegas odds.}
<A>__{touches the panel. the big screen now holds three faces, three names.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{research reveals three known fences, still at large, who are believed to have brokered vermeers to black market buyers. sandrine palmer is hospitalized in malta with ovarian cancer.}
<A>__{one face and name disappears. two remain. koichi naruhito.}
<B>__{hiroyuki yamaji.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{the other two. live in tokyo.}
<A>__{a tiny, dry, adorable, shrug. which says, bingo.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{and you did all this since 4:30 this morning.}
<A>__{grinning small at each other. she can't help that hers is hot. she never can.}
<C>__{cruz }
<D>__{plus. you were polite to a stranger.}
<A>__{one of those moments when his attraction to her is too obvious to ignore. best to defuse by pretending it's a joke...}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{sounds like you're sorry you're already a friend.}
<A>__{said as banter between pals. which doesn't make her wrong.}
