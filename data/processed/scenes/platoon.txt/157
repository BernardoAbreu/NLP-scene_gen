<A>__{chris bellies into the area, see barnes, recognizes him, amazed. an enemy fires, taking barnes high in the left thigh. a patch of skin blowing off. barnes rigidly goes down on his left knee like a wounded horse. holds there, staring into the enemy, waiting for the coup de grace. a series of shouts and the enemy staggers dead as: chris lays out a curtain of fire. a grenade goes off near him, blowing off his helmet. dazed, chris rushes forward firing from the hip sucked into barnes' suicidal vacuum. he cuts down an enemy as: barnes, given a new lease, limps angrily forward and tackles a wounded enemy trying to crawl away, terrified at the sight of barnes coming after him. barnes lets out a vivid scream. and beats the soldier mercilessly, half the stock of his m 16 flying apart broken. chris swivels alert on his knees. a pause. no more enemy. turns to barnes, his back to chris still beating at the dead corpse.}

<A>__{barnes swivels instinctively off the corpse and for a petrifying moment chris sees: a maddened scar of a face, lips specked with foam. the eyes refracted in a red green flare overhead the pupils distorted into angry red points. for chris it is no doubt the most frightening single image he has seen in his life. it will be in his nightmares forever. the essence of evil: wrath, obsession, anger, fear, hatred, permanence he is paralyzed. barnes smashes him full across the face with the broken stock of his m 16. not even conciously, for at this point, his mind has gone over the edge and the entire world is his enemy. american or vietnamese, it makes no difference as he strikes chris harder and harder. chris struggles, moans, his teeth and nose cracked. barnes emits another chilling yell an springs like a humpback up on his good right leg, the left bent set to deliver the killing blow, the mangled rifle pulled to its highest arc.}

<A>__{the phantom fighter jet comes now like a great white whale. one big beautiful monstrous beat of deafening sound. its silver and white belly hurtling low over the treeline in one giant leap of sound momentarily illuminated by a flare. then a monstrous roar of anger. the bomb ripping barnes off the body of chris and spitting chris across the jungle floor crashing into a tree some 30 yards away.}
