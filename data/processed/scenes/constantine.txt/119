<D>__{he was finished off by a soldier's spear.}
<A>__{he points in the bible at a detailed painting of the event jesus hanging on the cross being pierced by a soldier's spear. it matches that child's drawing john removed from the fridge now lying on his seat.}

<C>__{angela}
<D>__{i lost it.}
<A>__{bam, something lands hard on the roof, denting it a good foot. a huge clawed talon punches into the sheet metal, starts shredding it right over angela. talon thrusts in. angela dodges it her amulet swinging wildly. john hits the brakes and the beast flips off the roof and onto the hood right into view. a muscular anomaly with eyes that are unmistakably balthazar's. he lashes against the windshield with an extra appendage. thank god for safety glass. he jerks back his embedded talon, pulls the entire windshield out with it, smashing it on the hood. glass particles explode into the car. john throws the car into a spin, slamming the barracuda into several parked cars. balthazar is uprooted, is thrown from the car. angela looks back, sees balthazar rolling into traffic.}
