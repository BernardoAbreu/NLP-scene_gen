<A>__{a go between emerges from a gallery with a wrapped painting, hands it to yuri, waiting in a limo.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{by the mid nineties, my wealth had caught up to my lies about my wealth even surpassed the lies.}
<A>__{yuri pays the go between in cash, places the painting in the trunk.}
<L>__{interior living room new york apartment. night.}
<A>__{yuri enters the front door, drops his luggage at the door. ava, talking excitedly on the phone, hangs up, runs to greet him. vitaly, in the background, cocktail in hand, with another dubious looking girlfriend, is examining another of ava's paintings.}
<C>__{ava}
<D>__{yuri, i just got off the phone with the dealer. i sold my first painting.}
<A>__{yuri and vitaly greet each other with a nod.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(feigning surprise)}
<D>__{fantastic. who bought it?}
<C>__{ava}
<D>__{someone important. they want to remain anonymous.}
<P>__{(asking in a way that does not expect an answer)}
<D>__{how was your trip?}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{you know. same old, same old.}
<P>__{(quickly changing the subject)}
<D>__{where's nicki, in bed?}

<P>__{(still giddy at the news)}
<D>__{my first painting. i'm officially an artist!}
<A>__{he watches ava showing off more of her paintings to vitaly and the latest girlfriend.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{i figured i was a patron of the arts and of everything else ava had tried and failed at after modelling. acting, her own cosmetics line. i didn't sabotage her careers but i can't deny it was convenient for me in maintaining a low profile. she was a beautiful bird in a gilded cage.}
