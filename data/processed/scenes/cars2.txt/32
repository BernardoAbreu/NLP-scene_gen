<A>__{an industrial dock, outside of the city proper.}
<L>__{interior shipyard night}
<A>__{rod redline dangles from a car magnet. he's been beaten up, clings to consciousness.}
<C>__{grem }
<D>__{i gotta admit }
<A>__{grem, acer, and a bunch of nasty looking troublemakers look up at rod amidst crates and shipping containers.}
<C>__{grem}
<D>__{ you tricked us real good.}
<C>__{acer}
<D>__{and we don't like being tricked.}
<A>__{rod redline laughs to himself.}
<C>__{acer}
<D>__{hey, what's so funny?}
<C>__{rod redline}
<D>__{well, you know, i was just wearing a disguise. you guys are stuck looking like that.}
<A>__{this doesn't help him. they drop him onto a treadmill, lock him down. a container is wheeled forward and rod is plied with allinol brand gasoline.}
<C>__{rod redline}
<D>__{allinol? thanks, fellas. i hear this stuff is good for you.}
<C>__{professor zundapp }
<D>__{so you think.}
<A>__{the professor emerges from the darkness, behind rod.}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<D>__{allinol by itself is good for you.}
<A>__{zundapp hits a button and the treadmill starts rod's wheels spinning at a high rate of speed.}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<D>__{but after microscopic examination, i have found that it has one small weakness. when hit with an electromagnetic pulse, it becomes extremely dangerous.}
<C>__{grem}
<D>__{smile }
<A>__{grem pushes a world grand prix camera the same one that was in the box back at the oil derrick. he points it at rod redline.}
<C>__{grem}
<D>__{ for the camera.}
<C>__{rod redline}
<D>__{is that all you want? i got a whole act.}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<D>__{you were very interested in this camera on the oil platform. now you will witness what it really does.}
<C>__{rod redline}
<D>__{whatever you say, professor.}
<A>__{acer pushes a tv monitor toward rod. on it, surveillance footage from the party. clearly, they were watching and recording him there.}
<C>__{acer}
<D>__{you talked up a lot of cars last night. which one's your associate?}
<C>__{rod redline}
<D>__{your mother. oh no, i'm sorry. it was your sister. you know, i can't tell them apart these days.}
<C>__{grem}
<P>__{(had enough)}
<D>__{could i start it now, professor?}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<D>__{fifty percent power.}
<P>__{(to rod redline)}
<D>__{this camera is actually an electromagnetic pulse emitter.}
<C>__{acer}
<P>__{(re: a girl on the tv)}
<D>__{what about her? did you give it to her?}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<D>__{the allinol is now heating to a boil, dramatically expanding, causing the engine block to crack under the stress, forcing oil into the combustion chamber.}
<A>__{rod redline's engine starts to crack and break.}
<C>__{acer}
<P>__{(re: a guy on the tv)}
<D>__{how about him? you talk to him?}
<C>__{rod redline}
<P>__{(to professor zundapp)}
<D>__{what do i care? i can replace an engine block.}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<D>__{you may be able to, but after full impact of the pulse, unfortunately, there will be nothing to replace.}
<C>__{acer}
<D>__{how about him? does he have it?}
<A>__{the monitor reveals mater, rolling out of the bathroom and down the hall. rod redline, seeing this, does the world's most subtle double take. we caught it, but there's no way anyone else in the room could have }
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<D>__{that's him. he's the one.}
<C>__{grem}
<D>__{roger that, professor z.}
<C>__{rod redline}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{as grem turns up the machine even more, the professor makes a call.}
<C>__{professor zundapp }
<D>__{yes sir. we believe the infiltrator has passed along sensitive information.}
<P>__{(beat, listening)}
<D>__{i will take care of it before any damage can be done.}
<A>__{the professor hangs up, turns to the room.}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<D>__{the project is still on schedule. you will find this second agent }
<A>__{zundapp kicks the camera's power into the red.}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<D>__{ and kill him.}
<A>__{on the monitor with mater's frozen image on the screen we see rod explode in the reflection.}
