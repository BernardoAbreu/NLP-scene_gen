<A>__{the commandos climb down a steel access ladder into a storage room stacked with crates and cartons. there's only one door. the place seems secure.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{stand down. five minutes.}
<A>__{wesker sits on a crate and pulls out his printed charts. gradually the whole troop makes it down into the room. they relax. a few light cigarettes. but not speyer.}

<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{you wanna see a wall blow, i will blow all of 'em for ya.}
<A>__{wesker reaches down to the electronic unit that he lost and retrieved in the woods. he pulls a long wire out of it, with a small sensor on the end.}
<C>__{wesker }
<D>__{i will put a crater in this forest that takes out racoon city and everything else for twenty miles... with this.}
<A>__{he jams the little sensor into his ear and pushes a button on the belt unit. small red lights blink.}
<C>__{wesker }
<D>__{it's a radio detonator...to set off explosives that are...buried under neath us somewhere. the ultimate containment measure. incinerate the place. (smiling again) it has a... dead man mechanism... .(he taps the ear piece) ...that reads my pulse. my heart stops, and... boom.}
