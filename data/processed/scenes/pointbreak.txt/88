<D>__{good of you to join us, hotshot.}
<P>__{(to babbit)}
<D>__{watch it. i told you, not on the hairs, goddammit.}

<D>__{i'm ready to rock, angelo. where you want me?}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{cole and munoz are going in the back door. babbit is backing me. so i want you at the side window by the hedge. you're strictly backup, got it?}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{got it.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{awright. get into position. i'm rolling.}
<A>__{pappas pulls the loose hawaiian shirt down over the radio mike gear and his stalwart .38 snub. he steps out from behind a fence and walks along the sidewalk toward bunker's house, two doors down. he is wearing polyester shorts and sandals, and carrying a dog}

<D>__{here scooby! where are you boy? here scooby!! you furball piece of shit.}
<A>__{cole and munoz snap around the corner of the garage and sprint low toward the rear of the brown stucco house. utah circles back out through the alley. tracking with him as he makes it to the neighbor's back hedge and crab walks toward bunker's house. babbit and another agent make it to the front corner of the stucco house, staying out of sight of the windows. angelo is walking up to the falling down porch of this low rent roach hotel. johnny is elbow crawling between the house and a tall hedge. he slides quietly in below a bedroom window. he pulls out the little leather kit he tucked in his waistband. removes something from it. a dental mirror. moving slowly, he raises it above the window sill, angling it where he can see inside. tight on dental mirror, johnny's pov. we see a bedroom through a gap in the venetian blind. tone is lying on the bed, wearing headphones. cranked up speedmetal. his eyes are screwed shut, and his fists pump to the beat like karate on 40,000 volts. the door to a bathroom is open, and the black haired girl can be made out behind rippled shower glass. tight on doorbell as pappas rings it. utah jumps at an explosion of sound. he spins in a microsecond, pistol aimed at... a lawn mower. through the hedge we can just see the neighbor, sixtyish and polyester clad, as he adjusts the choke on the roaring machine about two feet from johnny's face. utah exhales and lowers the gun. wipes sweat from his eyes. tight on pappas, smiling open faced and goofily charming as... the door opens, revealing a girl we haven't seen before. she has hair like bleached fiberglass, black eye makeup and nails. ramones style wardrobe. she looks tense, and won't open the door very far.}

<D>__{yeah? what?}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{have you seen a little dog? kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing. about this big.}
<C>__{fiberglass}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{utah blinks at what he sees. his pov, in the little mirror. like a silent pantomime under the roar of the mower, he sees bunker and warchild come flying into the room. they are hyper and manic. eyes wild. bunker leaps clear over the bed. grabs a combat shotgun from the closet. throws it to warchild. tone is oblivious. bunker thumps him in the chest and tone leaps up like an overwound toy, gaping "what the fuck?!" we read his lips saying. bunker grabs a steyr assault rifle, white knuckled, while tone fumbles around and comes up with a .45 colt auto.}

<P>__{(into his headset)}
<D>__{babbit. get angelo out of there. they're pulling out a fucking arsenal! babbit, you copy? cole? don't let him pull his badge!}
