<A>__{move slow. examine close: eye bolt pulley system, jerry rigged around the door. severed twine attached to the trigger of a shotgun taped atop a jello mold at knee level. continue to look around. sex horror grimace: like catching pop fingering mom. junior's place a tiny, filthy one bedroom.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{junior the insane: you couldn't hide what he was hiding in 1958 la, and not have it rot your mind.}
<A>__{bear traps barely hidden under sheets. rat traps garnished with razor blades across the floor. smell rotten flowers: his shirt that i wore bled on crumpled on his pillow yellowed jizz stains cover black blood stains. stifle a gag. card table: an empty green banded evidence bag. gape at it. then walk over, read the abstracts: 1284 south tremaine.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{junior stealing evidence from the magdalena crime scene.}
<A>__{then i see the bookcase. top shelf: police manuals. bottom two shelves: wall to wall red steno pads, all exactly the same brand. shock. step over. flip through them: tiny, architect neat script covers every page. the running dialogue of a functional fucking freak: magdalena residence. 1284 s. tremaine. recovered: magdalena financial records ledgers. some entries redacted. translated `hh' into `hurwitz holdings' after recovering mail. seems suspicious. brought to attention of klein. brushed off. press in spite of klein's laziness or}
<B>__{lack of interest.}
<A>__{a hand drawn cock doodled beneath that, then below: dave wearing form fitting shirt today. handsome. i want to pull it drop the steno like it might bite. pick up another: same drill.}
<B>__{welles noonan will win out. klein not skilled or smart enough to duel with a u.s. attorney much less the fbi. deep admiration for}
<A>__{noonan's cause. his purpose is pure. don't want to get dragged down}
<B>__{with poison pill klein. make him pay for patronizing me.}
<A>__{pick up yet another, hands shaking, turn to the last page:}
<B>__{make klein hurt like i hurt. trade him. trade everything. trade up to}

<D>__{junior the climber, trading me up to noonan. thinks bootlicking will buy him a bureau gig.}
<A>__{now, rifle for that knife. systemically destroy the place. dump the stenos in a trash can, sift for matches, strike, watch the pads catch and floosh, feed the fire with random paperwork, sift junior's cock obsessed doodles scribbled by the dozen. under the bed now, carpet covered in rat traps. spring them, clear a space. a box: beefcake booty, gay smut mags, gay classified ads. first person perspective polaroids of junior's stomach being kissed by the diskant quiff and vice versa. open a massive steamer trunk against a far wall. arsenal: handguns, shotguns, a surplus m 1. dump it, kick contents. only interested in that knife. move into his kitchenette. check the freezer even though junior is smarter than that: amyl nitrate poppers, vodka, benzedrine, cocaine. close it. look down. stop: indents in the cheap tile floor from where the refrigerator used to sit. pull to see what's behind. eyes catch the bear trap near the bed as i tug: ugly rusted waiting. stop part ii: contort, peer behind the refrigerator: a pineapple shaped hand grenade duct taped to the wall, next to a built in safe.}
