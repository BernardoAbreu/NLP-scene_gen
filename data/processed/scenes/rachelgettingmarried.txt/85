<A>__{a `98 maroon camry is idling in the circular driveway out front, exhaust vaporizing against the chilly morning air. a cute two year old girl is visible in a carseat and rosa, the staff nurse from kym's halfway house, is at the wheel. the car radio plays quietly as kym opens the passenger door, wiggling her finger at the little girl. like a ghost, rachel appears on the porch. kym jumps a little. the sisters lock eyes. kym looks pained. paul is still moving around in there. she wants to go. rachel floats down the porch stairs and joins her sister at the car. she takes in rosa who meets rachel's look with a nod.}

<A>__{rachel hugs her sister fiercely. kym gets into the passenger seat but leaves the car door open. rachel smiles her huge, luminous smile. kym shuts the car door and rolls down the window.}
