<L>__{exterior rolls royce}
<A>__{the rear door opens, and cyrus kriticos, 50s, wealthy, immaculately dressed, not a hair out of place, steps out. his hand rests on a shiny, silver headed cane. he surveys the flares, shakes his head.}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{their little crusade is wearing thin.}
<C>__{rafkin }
<D>__{i will give them this... they are consistent.}
<A>__{stepping out next is dennis rafkin, 20s, unshaven, jittery. he holds his head in his hands, massaging his temples, obviously in pain. cyrus produces a thin, brown designer cigarette from a silver case. taps it as he speaks.}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{as cancer...}
<P>__{(lights his cigarette)}
<D>__{never bet against human nature, dennis. you'll always lose.}
<A>__{behind him, rafkin suddenly lurches forward, racked by spasms. cyrus turns, with slight concern }
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{is it bad tonight?}
<C>__{rafkin}
<P>__{(coughing, shaking)}
<D>__{bad is one way of describing it, but somehow...}
<P>__{(wiping his sweaty forehead)}
<D>__{... insane seems more appropriate.}
<A>__{rafkin doubles over in pain. dry heaves.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<P>__{(recovering)}
<D>__{it's my professional opinion that we get the hell out of here. now.}
<A>__{two of cyrus's team, dressed in assault gear, make their way over.}
<C>__{cyrus}
<P>__{(ignoring rafkin, re: flares)}
<D>__{noted. clean this place up, and locate our guests.}
<A>__{cyrus snaps his fingers. an assistant steps forward with a large photo. when cyrus turns around, he catches rafkin gulping down prescription drugs. cyrus strikes the bottle out of rafkin's hand with his cane. pink medicine runs down rafkin's face as he turns with rage.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{come on, cyrus, i gotta take the edge off.}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{you know the routine. first things first. now where is he?}
<A>__{cyrus holds it in the limo headlights; an aerial photo of the graveyard. rafkin, closing his eyes, reaches out towards the photo with one hand, then touches the earth with the other. a silent moment.}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{where?}
<A>__{then a huge spark arcs between the psychic and the ground. rafkin jolts back, as if shocked.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{sweet jesus, cyrus, there's got to be over forty victims here! i thought you said this guy killed twenty people.}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{twenty when he was alive. he's added a few more since then. now where's the breaker, dennis?}
<A>__{rafkin ignores the photo, and points at a spot deep inside the auto graveyard. cyrus grabs a headset from the assistant.}
<C>__{cyrus}
<P>__{(into microphone)}
<D>__{all teams go to alpha. i repeat }
