<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{int: convenience store. day}
<A>__{a small crowd gathers around the activist as he orates. it has become something of a rally.}
<C>__{activist}
<D>__{you're spending what? twenty, thirty dollars a week on cigarettes.}
<C>__{listener 1}
<D>__{forty.}
<C>__{listener 2}
<D>__{fifty three.}
<C>__{activist}
<D>__{fifty three dollars. would you pay someone that much money every week to kill you? because that's what you're doing now, by paying for the so called privilege to smoke!}
<C>__{listener 3}
<D>__{we all gotta go sometime...}
<C>__{activist}
<D>__{it's that kind of mentality that allows this cancer producing industry to thrive. of course we're all going to die someday, but do we have to pay for it? do we have to actually throw hard earned dollars on a counter and say, "please, please, mister merchant of death, sir; please sell me something that will give me bad breath, stink up my clothes, and fry my lungs."}
<C>__{listener 1}
<D>__{it's not that easy to quit.}
<C>__{activist}
<D>__{of course it's not; not when you have people like this mindless cretin so happy and willing to sell you nails for your coffin!}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{hey, now wait a sec...}
<C>__{activist}
<D>__{now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.}
<C>__{activist }
<D>__{friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the earth...just like cigarettes are doing now! cigarette smoking is the new holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the nazis of the nineties! he doesn't care how many people die from it! he smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "have a nice day."}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i think you'd better leave now.}
<C>__{activist}
<D>__{you want me to leave? why? because somebody is telling it like it is? somebody's giving these fine people a wake up call?!}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{you're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.}
<C>__{activist}
<D>__{you're the disturbance, pal! and here...}
<P>__{(slaps a dollar on the counter)}
<D>__{i'm buying some...what's this?...chewlie's gum. there. i'm no longer loitering. i'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.}
<C>__{listener 2}
<P>__{(to dante)}
<D>__{yeah, now shut up so he can speak!}
<C>__{activist}
<D>__{oh, he's scared now! he sees the threat we present! he smells the changes coming, and the loss of sales when the nonsmokers finally demand satisfaction. we demand the right to breathe cleaner air!}
<C>__{listener 3}
<D>__{yeah!}
<C>__{activist}
<D>__{we'd rather chew our gum than embrace slow death! let's abolish this heinous practice of sucking poison, and if it means ruffling the feathers of a convenience store idiot, then so be it!}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{that's it, everybody out.}
<C>__{activist}
<D>__{we're not moving! we have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{yeah, but not in here.}
<C>__{activist}
<D>__{what better place than this? to stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{like i'm responsible for all the smokers!}
<C>__{activist}
<D>__{the ones in this town, yes! you encourage their growth, their habit. you're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! for good, cancer merchant!}
<A>__{the small crowd begins to chant and jeer in dante's face.}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{cancer merchant! cancer merchant! cancer merchant!}
<A>__{veronica enters and surveys the mess. the crowd throws cigarettes at dante, pelting him in the face. suddenly, a loud blast is heard, and white powder explodes over the throng. everyone turns to face... veronica as she stands in one of the freezer cases, holding a fire extinguisher.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{who's leading this mob?}
<A>__{the crowd looks among themselves. someone points to o.c.}
<C>__{someone}
<D>__{that guy.}
<A>__{the activist carries his briefcase surreptitiously toward the door.}
<C>__{veronica }
<D>__{freeze.}
<A>__{veronica jumps off the freezer case, training the nozzle of the extinguisher on the activist.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{let's see some credentials.}
<A>__{he reaches into his briefcase. she pokes the extinguisher nozzle at him, warningly.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{slowly...}
<A>__{he pulls out a business card and hands it to her. she reads it.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{you're a chewlie's gum representative?}
<A>__{he nods.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{and you're stirring up all this antismoking sentiment to...what?...sell more gum?}
<A>__{he nods again.}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(through gritted teeth)}
<D>__{get out of here.}
<A>__{he quickly flees. she blasts him with more chemical as he exits.}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(to the crowd)}
<D>__{and you people: don't you have jobs to go to? get out of here and go commute.}
<A>__{the crowd sheepishly exits, one by one, offering apologetic glances. dante tries to regain his composure. veronica watches the crowd disperse, disgusted.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{you oughta be ashamed of yourselves. easily led automatons. try thinking for yourself before you pelt and innocent man with cigarettes.}
<A>__{the last of the crowd exits. veronica sets the fire extinguisher down next to dante. dante is sitting on the floor, head in his folded arms.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{it looked like tiananmen square in here for a second.}
<A>__{dante is silent.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{"thank you, veronica; you saved me from an extremely ugly mob scene."}
<A>__{dante remains silent.}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(sits beside him)}
<D>__{okay, champ. what's wrong?}
<A>__{dante lifts his head and shoots her a disgusted look.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{all right, stupid question. but don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{too hard?! i don't have enough indignities in my life people start throwing cigarettes at me!}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{at least they weren't lit.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i hate this fucking place.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{then quit. you should be going to school anyway...}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{please, veronica. last thing i need is a lecture at this pointerior}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{all i'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i'm not even supposed to be here today!}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i know. i stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{the guy got sick and couldn't come in.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{don't you have a hockey game at two?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{yes! and i'm going to play like shit because i didn't get a good night's sleep!}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{why did you agree to come in then?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i'm only here until twelve, then i'm gone. the boss is coming in.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{somebody jammed the locks with gum.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{you're kidding.}

<C>__{dante}
<D>__{who's defensive? just...would you just hug me?! all right? your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.}
