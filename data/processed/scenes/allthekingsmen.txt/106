<C>__{willie}
<D>__{it's a far cry from where i come from... to this house.}
<A>__{camera pulls back. the room is crowded with people, all of them friends of the stantons. anne, adam, judge stanton, mrs. burden, and mcevoy are part of the audience sitting around the fireplace. jack stands next to willie.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{and standing here under the portrait of one of the greatest governors of this state, talking to you people... well, it's an honor i never thought i'd have.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{are there any questions?}
<P>__{(looks around)}
<D>__{mr. mcevoy.}
<C>__{mcevoy}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{no, i have no questions.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{judge?}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{a few... but it will hold.}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{i have a question.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{shoot.}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{a lot of people in this state have been saying that you've been making deals... some of them with the very groups that you claim you're against. is that true?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{adam, you know how rumors start...}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{yes. yes, that's true. i have nothing to hide. i will make a deal with the devil if it'll help me carry out my program. but believe me, there are no strings attached to those deals.}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{you're sure about that?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{doc, jack here has been telling me how you feel about things... how you'd like to see a new hospital built, a hospital that's the biggest and best that money can buy. you want those things, doc, because, well, because you're a man who wants to do good. now, i'd like to ask you a question.}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{shoot.}
<A>__{the guests laugh good naturedly.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{do you know what good comes out of?}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{you tell me, mr. stark.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{out of bad... that's what good comes out of. because you can't make it out of anything else. you didn't know that, did you?}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{no, i didn't... there's another question i'd like to ask you. you say there's only bad to start with and the good must come with the bad. who's to determine what's good and what's bad?... you?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{why, that's easy. just... just make it up as you go along.}
<A>__{more laughter. willie smiles and goes on.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{folks, there's a time to talk and there's a time to act. i think the time to act is right now. and with your support, i not only will win but i will do all of the things i promised. i need your help. oh, i need it badly. but i'm not going to beg for it. in the name of this state which we love... in the name of the governor in whose house we meet... i demand it.}
<A>__{there is immediate applause. anne is the first to rush over and shake willie's hand.}
