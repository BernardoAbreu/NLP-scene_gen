<A>__{ray gets in the car and sets the bundle down on the seat, unwraps it from layers of swaddling and begins taking off it's clothes. it is a boy. she tries to resuscitate him, but there is no response.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{it's dead.}
<A>__{ray keeps giving it air. there is no response but she keeps at it. then, between breaths:}

<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i don't want to touch it.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{well, i can't hold it and drive.}

<C>__{ray}
<D>__{at least put him next to your body. that will warm him up.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{but it's too late.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{just do it! we can't give it back to her cold.}
