<A>__{lincoln sits before an open window. he's dishevelled, in shirtsleeves an unbuttoned vest, next to an inkwell, papers and books of law scattered about, and a lit candle in a candlestick, guttering. grant's telegraph is in one hand, and in the other hand, his spectacles and, dangling from a chain, his open pocket watch. his bare left foot keeps time with the watch's loud ticking. he stares out into the cold night.}
