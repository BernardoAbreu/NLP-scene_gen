<A>__{frances' hair is tightly curled. she is dressed in a grotesquely ruffled white gown and seated on a small stool. behind her two assistants fuss with bunches of white carnations hanging on a grid. a seasoned publicist kneels nearby and a woman with a coffee cup, claire, surveys the scene.}
<C>__{photographer }
<D>__{one more time.}

<D>__{oh, i swim some... play the piano badly... and i read like a fiend: i like history.}
<C>__{publicist}
<D>__{no, no, people don't want that. now listen: you spend lots of time at the beach. you're crazy about dancing. and you're the kind of girl who's just a little in love with love. get it? now try again? hobbies?}

<A>__{the camera clicks again. mr. bebe a tall, brooding, well dressed man enters.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{good morning, mr. bebe!}
<C>__{bebe}

<D>__{'the most interesting thing about frances farmer is that her road to hollywood was 12,000 miles long. after winning a beauty contest, the first prize of which was a trip to europe...' she made some deal with the commies and went to moscow, but i'm not going to say that, am i?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{heavens no. go on.}
<C>__{publicist}
<D>__{um... 'miss farmer returned to new york city and had a brief fling with the broadway stage before coming west to seek stardom.'}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{'brief fling?'}
<C>__{publicist}
<D>__{well, actually she couldn't get hired, but lucky for her, some guy in our new york office saw her. she says soon as she gets a stake, she's going back.}
<A>__{claire rolls her eyes. she's heard this before. the camera clicks again. frances is frozen in time.}
