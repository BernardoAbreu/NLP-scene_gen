<L>__{intercut flashback:}
<A>__{we see images of that night, as we saw in the opening.}
<C>__{aramis' voice}
<D>__{they brought a baby from the back of the palace, into the black carriage i had waiting. they had given the driver instructions about where it was, and i was ordered to make the whole journey with the blinds of the carriage drawn.}
<A>__{in the flashback we see the young musketeer aramis, his face shielded in shadow, handing a living bundle over to someone at one of the back doors of a large country house.}
<C>__{aramis' voice}
<D>__{i carried that baby into the countryside, to a chateau, like this one. and there i left him.}
<B>__{aramis in the present}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i have never forgotten that night, or what i carried.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{i don't understand. what does this have to do with...? you carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but }
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{not just a baby, porthos. i carried the child of the king.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{the child of the king is... the king. louis!}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{no, not louis!}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{athos, do you understand this? he confuses me }
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i carried the king's child! the queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{but why?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne. then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins. so he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed. you, phillippe.}
<A>__{phillippe is pale... we dissolve to : a flashback of phillippe's early education in the country house.}
<C>__{aramis' voice}
<D>__{the old king ordered you be educated and well treated, but your identity kept from you and all those around you.}
<A>__{the flashback moves to the palace, matching the narration }
<C>__{aramis' voice}
<D>__{on his death bed, he revealed your existence to louis and your mother. your mother had been told by her own priest that you had died at birth. somehow she blamed herself for ever believing it, and she wished to restore your birthright. but now louis was king.}
<A>__{we see in flashback louis wearing his new crown, plotting.}
<C>__{aramis' voice}
<D>__{a priest, even a pope, he could kill without hesitation, but he was afraid to kill you, for his whole claim to power rests on the sanctity of royal blood. so he had you hidden in a way that only a monster could devise. i know, for it was i who took you to prison, and the iron mask. someday i will ask your forgiveness. but not until we have restored to you what is yours.}
<A>__{we are in present time again. all eyes are on phillippe.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{restored...?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{we will replace louis with phillippe. no one but the king himself and now we knows phillippe even exists. all we have to do is switch them.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{switch?! that is your plan? it is ludicrous!}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i have it all worked out.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{physical resemblance is but one small thing! louis has an arrogance, a manner }
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{those can be adopted }
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{and people close to him, who }
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{do you think i have not considered that? i have a plan and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{it is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours! it is phillippe's as well!}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{yes, and he has a choice!}
<A>__{aramis stops thundering at athos, and turns to phillippe.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{what about it, phillippe?! all that time in prison, all that time you suffered, was it for nothing?! you memorized the entire bible, or so your priest told me! an act of survival, of defiance, of courage! your years within the mask have given you reserves of strength that others could not imagine. your home was a dungeon and now you may be a king, if you have the heart to make it so! do you have the heart?}
<A>__{phillippe stands shakily, and faces them.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{i will try.}
<A>__{phillippe walks nearly wanders from the room.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{you see? a king.}
<A>__{athos, with a glare at aramis, follows phillippe.}
