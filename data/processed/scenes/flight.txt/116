<A>__{whip sits in his car. rain pounds the windshield as we watch him expertly add vodka to a half full bottle of orange juice. whip gives the bottle a shake before taking a long drink. whip takes another drink before re capping the bottle and stowing it in the glove box. whip gets out and we watch him walk in the rain towards the door of the hangar. a security guard meets him and takes him inside.}
