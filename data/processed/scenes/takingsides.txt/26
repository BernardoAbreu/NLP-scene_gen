<L>__{interior steve's office day}
<A>__{silence. steve studying his notes. david watching him. emmi staring forlornly into space.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{okay, emmi, go get him.}
<A>__{emmi rises, opens the door, nods, turns back to steve.}
<C>__{emmi}
<D>__{dr. furtwangler.}
<A>__{furtwangler enters. as he passes her, emmi gives him a small curtsey. david nods. steve doesn't look up. furtwangler waits a moment, glances round, sees the more comfortable chair and sits in it. steve looks up.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i didn't hear anyone invite you to sit down.}
<A>__{furtwangler stands. steve points to the other chair.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{sit there.}
<A>__{furtwangler sits.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i want you to understand why you're here. you're automatically banned from public life under control council directive no 24. we're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the tribunal for artists of the denazification commission. you understand that?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i have already been cleared by a denazification tribunal in austria.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{what they do in austria doesn't interest me one little bit. okay? i have your questionnaire here,}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{gustav heinrich ernst martin wilhelm furtwangler, born berlin, january 1886. orchestral conductor. and you say here you were never a member of the nazi party.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{that is correct.}
<A>__{a very long silence. when the silence is unbearable steve speaks.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{could you tell us about being made a prussian privy councillor. how did that happen to a non party member?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i received a telegram from hermann goering informing me that he had made me a privy councillor. i was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. after the dreadful events of november 1938, the violent attacks on the jews, i stopped using the title.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{what about vice president of the chamber of music, you used that title didn't you? but then i suppose you had no choice there either, because i suppose dr. goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, dear mr. vice president.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i don't think dr. goebbels sent me a telegram. i was simply told. in a letter, i believe. i don't remember exactly.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{goebbels and goering were sure heaping honours on you. one makes you a privy councillor, the other makes you vice president of the chamber of music, and you weren't even a member of the party, how do you explain that?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{well, there was a constant battle between goering and goebbels as to which of them would control german culture. i was simply a pawn. anyway, i resigned from the musikkammer at the same time i resigned as musical director of the berlin philharmonic orchestra. in 1934.}
<A>__{david puts up a hand. steve nods.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{why was that? why did you resign, dr. furtwangler?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i wrote an open letter to the newspapers condemning what they were doing to music, making these distinctions between jews and non jews. for my part, the only divide in art is between good and bad. eventually, goebbels summoned me and told me i could leave the country if i wanted to but under no condition would i ever be allowed to return. i always believe that you have to fight from the inside not from without. i asked myself, what's the duty of an artist, to stay or to leave? and then goebbels demanded that i acknowledge hitler as solely responsible for cultural policy. well, that was a fact and it seemed pointless to deny it. i simply acknowledged that hitler and the minister of culture appointed by him were solely responsible for the cultural policy of the reich. what i wanted to express was that i, personally, had no responsibility whatsoever for their cultural policy. i have always had the view that art and politics should... should have nothing to do with each other.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{then why did you conduct at one of their nuremberg rallies?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<P>__{(flaring)}
<D>__{i did not conduct at at the rally, i conducted on the evening before the rally.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{that sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, wilhelm. and what about april 19, 1942? the eve of hitler's fifty third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for hitler, didn't you? was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<P>__{(flustered)}
<D>__{that... that was a different matter, i... i was tricked.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{how come?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{could i have a glass of water, please? please, fraulein?}
<C>__{emmi}
<D>__{straube.}
<A>__{steve looks expectant but furtwangler remains silent. steve nods to emmi, who gets the water. furtwangler drinks. steve waits.}
<C>__{furtwaangler}
<D>__{thank you. i was in vienna, rehearsing the ninth symphony of beethoven, when goebbels called and said i had to conduct at hitler's birthday. i'd always managed to wriggle out of such invitations, pleading previous engagements, illness, having my doctors state i was not well and so on and so on. i was also fortunate that baldur von shirach, who controlled vienna, hated dr. goebbels and would do anything to thwart his wishes. but this time goebbels got to my doctors before me; they were frightened off, and von schirach was threatened, bullied and gave in. so, i had no alternative but to conduct for hitler. believe me, i knew i had compromised, and i deeply regret it.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(playing with him)}
<D>__{doesn't sound much of a trick to me. sounds like you made a deal.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i made no deal!}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i don't buy that.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{it's the truth.}
<A>__{silence. steve paces. then suddenly turns on furtwangler.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i keep hearing you helped a lot of jews to escape. how did you do that?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i don't remember in detail, there were so many.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{did you call someone you knew?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i may have, as... as i said, i simply don't remember.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{let me me help you, then. you picked up the phone and made a call }
<P>__{(mimes a telephone.)}
<D>__{'hello, adolf? wilhelm speaking. listen, old pal, there's a jew boy musician i want you to help. he needs a permit to get to paris.'}
<A>__{emmi sticks her fingers in her ears and shuts her eyes tight.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{or maybe you called goebbels or goering? you were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{may i ask a question?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{when will my case be heard by the tribunal?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{your guess is as good as mine.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i need to work. i need to make my living. i live off the generosity of friends...}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{tough, tough!}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<P>__{(now more and more agitated)}
<D>__{then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the party, who used to play the horst wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while i have to wait and wait and wait?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i don't know, he wasn't my case. why did you escape to switzerland just before the war ended?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{it was because i learned that the gestapo was about to arrest me.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{why were they going to arrest you?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i believe it was because of another letter i'd written to goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right?}
<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{so, how did you learn that the gestapo was out to get you?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{during an enforced hour long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in berlin, albert speer, the minister of armaments, said to me, 'you look very tired dr. furtwangler, you should go abroad for a while.' i knew exactly what he meant.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you sure knew a lot of people in high places.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{it would be truer to say, i think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you were real close to all of them, to adolf, to hermann, to joseph, to baldur, and now albert,}
<P>__{(flaring)}
<D>__{so, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. what was your party number?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{if you are going to bully me like this, major, you had better do your homework. you obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.}
<A>__{steve is stung. his eyes narrow dangerously.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{david, you remember i said i had a question that he wouldn't be able to answer? well, i'm gonna ask it now. you ready for this, wilhelm? it's a tough one. why didn't you get out right at the start when hitler came to power in 1933? why didn't you leave germany?}
<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. bruno walter, otto klemperer, arnold schoenberg, max reinhardt...}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{they were jews, they had to leave. they were right to leave.}
<P>__{(he breathes deeply, summons strength.)}
<D>__{i could not leave my country in her deepest misery. after all, i am a german. i... i stayed in my homeland. is that my sin in your eyes?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{see, david? he can't answer the question. i will ask it again, wilhelm, and don't give me any more airy fairy, intellectual bullshit!}
<A>__{the telephone rings. no one moves. then emmi picks up the telephone.}
<C>__{emmi}
<D>__{major arnold's office. yes, he is.}
<A>__{offers the phone to david.}
<C>__{emmi}
<D>__{it's major richards for lieutenant wills.}
<A>__{david takes the telephone.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{david wills. yes, sir.}
<P>__{(listens.)}
<D>__{well, you want me to tell him? okay,}
<P>__{(to steve)}
<D>__{major richards wants a word with you, sir.}
<A>__{steve indicates he'll take the call on the extension. furtwangler stands. as steve crosses to the extension:}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(muttering)}
<D>__{why can't he just ask for me? why does he have to ask for you first? goddamn british, so correct!}
<A>__{he picks up the extension. emmi puts down her receiver.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{steve arnold...}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i've had enough of this, i'm leaving.}
<A>__{he goes quickly. david dashes after him.}
