<L>__{interior cell of the man in the iron mask}
<A>__{the prisoner has used the torn bible to make all sorts of amazing origami, invented from his own head. he looks up as he hears the door open, and sees aramis, the priest.}
<C>__{man in the iron mask}
<D>__{my confession day! but where is the other one?}
<A>__{aramis says something in latin the first words of the ceremony of absolution as the guards lock the door behind him and move off down the corridor.}
<C>__{man in the iron mask}
<D>__{i know you don't speak my language but is the other one all right? please tell me he is not dead too, or i will have lost everyone.}
<A>__{aramis goes on mumbling latin mechanically, for the sake of the retreating guards. the man in the iron mask is desperate for someone to talk to.}
<C>__{man in the iron mask}
<D>__{i... tore my bible. or someone else did. but it was all right. "let the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, oh lord our god and my redeemer."}
<A>__{aramis has stopped talking, and stares transfixed at this sight of the prisoner, in the iron mask.}
<C>__{man in the iron mask}
<D>__{i'm sorry. you're never seen me before. i must frighten you.}
<A>__{aramis puts his finger to his lips.}
<C>__{man in the iron mask}
<D>__{what are you doing? why do you }
<A>__{aramis clamps his hand over the mouth hole, and whispers }
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i am a friend, here to help you.}
<A>__{aramis hurriedly removes his robes, revealing the bundle.}
<C>__{man in the iron mask}
<D>__{what ?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{it is an escape. to freedom.}
<C>__{man in the iron mask}
<D>__{freedom...?}
<A>__{he says it as if the concept is beyond him. aramis undoes the bundle, revealing the limp body.}
<C>__{man in the iron mask}
<D>__{wh ? he is dead! who is he?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{he is you.}
<A>__{aramis uncovers the head of the body. it is covered in a mask, identical to the prisoner's.}
