<A>__{the corridor. it skids to rest in front of terminator, throwing out a white cloud which quickly fills the corridor.}
<L>__{173c in the elevator, sarah and john are choking, handing the breathing}
<A>__{mask back and forth desperately. they're scarred. this looks like it.}

<D>__{stop where you are. lie down on the floor, face down. down on floor, now!}
<A>__{he continues to stride toward them. the swats tense up. they've never seen anything like this. they're not sure what to do. closer and closer.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{drop him.}
<A>__{they open fire. the corridor is filled with cracking thunder. the rounds tear into terminator's chest. stomach. face. thighs. his leather jacket leaps and jerks as the rounds hit him. the swats think the guy's wearing body armor or something. they keep firing. the rounds tear into him, staggering him slightly, but he keeps moving.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{you're not hitting him! swat #1}
<P>__{(getting scared)}
<D>__{yes i am!}
<A>__{terminator draws his .45 smoothly. unhurried. he shoots the nearest man in the left thigh. as he screams and drops, terminator shoots him in the right thigh. terminator bends down and picks up the shrieking man's weapon... the tear gas launcher. it is one of those new rotary jobs that hold 12 rounds in a big drum. terminator shoots the next swat in the chest with the tear gas launcher. the gas canister hits the guy's body armor and doesn't penetrate. but it's like getting slugged in the stomach with a full swing from a baseball bat. the swat fold double and hits the tiles, gasping. terminator is an image from hell, a tall figure in shredded black leather, streaked with blood. one eye is a bloody socket, the metal eye servo glistening. the flesh of one cheek hangs down in tatters, revealing the chrome cheekbone beneath. the whole front of his jacket is blown open, revealing his metal armor chest. the remaining swats start to fall back. one turns to run and kpow! a gas canister nail him in the back, sending him sprawling.}
