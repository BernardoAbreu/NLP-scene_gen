<D>__{nikolai gets out of the mercedes and helps an extremely pissed kirill out of the car into the rain. kirill is so drunk he slips through nikolai's hands and lands in the gutter.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{we're partners now, man, you know?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, i know. nikolai manages to lift him to his feet again. as they head towards the restaurant, anna emerges. nikolai looks up, curious, as semyon kisses her on both cheeks in the doorway. as she turns kirill stumbles forwards and collapses in front of her. nikolai looks up at anna, his face splashed with rain.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{what? you never seen anybody pissed before? semyon looks down at the drunken kirill and slams the door of the restaurant. nikolai sighs, then turns to kirill and starts to go through his pockets.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{come on, kirill. where are your keys? anna walks around the two of them, watching the undignified struggle as nikolai finds kirill's keys. nikolai smiles at her.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{who are you, anyway? anna hurries away into the rain. nikolai finds kirill's keys and drags him toward the door of the restaurant.}
