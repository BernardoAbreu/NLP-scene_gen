<A>__{delaney opens the cupboard door and for a moment he and lisa are silhouetted in the doorway. delaney pulls a string hanging near the door and a light comes on. the cupboard is packed with various cleaning products.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{this is the storage cupboard. everything you will need for each task is here, each shelf is labelled.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{the most obvious task is hoovering. this is our hoover here, it's straight forward. you'll be surprised that although it's powerful it's very quiet, because we are working when everyone's in bed so obviously we don't want to wake them up! it has a telescopic suction tube and six stage filter system. so a lot more powerful than you may be used to.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{the mop and bucket is here, we usually use standard bleach to mix with the water so that's straight forward. but there is this specialist stain remover that you must use if there are any stains on the floor or carpet. it needs to be sprayed and left to set for twenty minutes before scrubbing or mopping. it's a special formula for tea, coffee, water marks and other yellow and brown discolourations on the carpets or floors. it's pretty strong so wash your hands after you use it!}
<C>__{lisa}
<C>__{okay}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{one of the worst parts of the job is we have to remove chewing gum from lots of surfaces. they don't just stick it underneath the tables, it ends up everywhere!}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{gross!}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{yes! i think a lot of the time it's the staff doing it, not the patients! but we have this gumcart, which is a bit complicated but it's easier than just scraping the gum. the steam is super heated to one hundred eighty degrees and delivered at seven point zero bar pressure. it can produce a hundred and fifteen litres of superheated steam per minute.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{is it okay if i watch you use it a few times first so i know exactly what i'm doing? i don't want to end up burning myself or any furniture!}
<A>__{delaney smiles.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{no problem. now here we come to the most dangerous chemical we have. this is a concrete cleaner, very toxic stuff, so you have to wear the face mask and gloves we have here, okay?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{this is for cleaning and descaling brick, stone and concrete and for metal de rusting. for concrete you must mix it one part to four parts water. brush or spray it on with the equipment here then leave it five to ten minutes to set, then rinse it off. but for those stubborn son of a bitch marks use it neat!}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{don't worry if anything seems complicated, you'll get used to it. but you'll mostly be mopping and hoovering in your first few weeks.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{yeah that's fine.}
