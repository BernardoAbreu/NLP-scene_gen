<L>__{interior library reading room day}
<A>__{moments later. he comes out from the stacks, working his way through the first page of paradise lost. he nearly bumps into a girl and they stop and look at one another. he tries to hold her gaze for a moment, challenging himself, but then turns away and stalks to a table. he sits and leans over the page. after a moment, though, he lifts his face and glances at... another girl, sitting further down the table. she looks up from her reading and returns his gaze. he smiles at her. she gets up and leaves. simon frowns, confounded and returns to his book. he takes out his notebook and pencil, meaning to take notes, but sees instead... a third girl sitting at another table, listening to her walkman and typing her homework into a laptop computer. he finds himself staring at her and forces himself back to his book. but he can't help himself and glances back over at her. with a sigh, he begins to write in his notebook...}

<D>__{why is it this beautiful girl makes me sad? does she know how beautiful she is? do people tell her? does she ever feel stupid?}
<A>__{he looks back over at her. she happens to look up and their eyes meet. she smiles. horrified, he looks down.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{why don't i smile when she looks at me? i look away. ashamed of myself.}
<A>__{he watches her again, thinks, then writes...}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{her figure makes me violent. i want to somehow break her. but tenderly. how is this possible? ask henry.}
<A>__{he writes a few moments more, scribbling across the page, then stops and looks back over at the girl.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{i can't breathe.}
<A>__{he tears out the page and folds it in half. then he gets up and crosses the room to where the girl is busily engaged in her work. she looks up, sees him, and removes her headset with a pleasant smile. he places his note on the table before her, then turns and walks quickly away. the girl watches him go, confused, then lifts the note and reads...}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{why do i do this to myself? and why do i reduce you to only one possibility? these are not even questions anymore. i know the answers myself. this isn't a page of notes. it's a letter. a letter to you. a desperate act. you are a miracle to me. i can't breathe.}
<A>__{by now, simon is gone from the library. the girl finishes reading the letter and looks around in astonishment.}
