She glances to the familiar Romulan crest that dominates one wall of the chamber: a ferocious bird-of-prey holding two planets, one in either claw. And then her eyes carefully cross the chamber to...

The box unfolds like a spider, standing on its legs.  Then it is still for a moment.  The Senator looks at it, puzzled. Suddenly -- a bright beam of green light shoots up from the spider -- the Senators are stunned -- the beam shoots to the high domed ceiling of the chamber and then cascades around the interior of the room, enveloping everything in a glowing shroud of green energy.  In a way, it is bizarrely beautiful. And then just as suddenly the light disappears. A moment of silence.  The Praetor and Senators are baffled.}
