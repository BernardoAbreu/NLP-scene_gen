<L>__{interior difford's office day}
<A>__{difford closes the doors behind him. he stares and alex and nick for a moment, assessing, calculating risks...}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{talk to me.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{there's something wrong with arcade. the game's alive somehow...}
<A>__{at this difford breaks into a smile. nick sees this and acts quickly to save the situation.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{no i'm not...}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(freezing her with a stare)}
<D>__{we're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right?}
<C>__{difford}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{that's what this is all about? tricks? sure, i'd be happy to introduce you to arcade's programmer.}
<A>__{alex has caught on. she shuts up for the moment.}
<C>__{difford}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{tell you what, i will take you down to our r&d labs right now.}
