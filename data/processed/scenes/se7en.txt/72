<L>__{interior mills' car morning}
<A>__{mills drives, follows a police van. somerset rides shotgun. mills is pumped, ready. somerset takes one rolaids tablet off a fresh roll and chews it.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{you ever take one?}
<A>__{somerset pulls out his gun, checks the load.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{no. never in twenty four years. i took my gun out only five times with the actual intention of using it. i never fired it. not once.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i pulled it once, fired it once. i never took a bullet.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{and?}
<A>__{mills turns a corner, tires screeching.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{it was my first one of these. we were a secondary unit, in vice. i was pretty shaky going in. when we busted the door, looking for a junkie, the fucking guy opened fire. one cop was hit in the arm. he went flying... like in slow motion.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i remember riding in the ambulance. his arm was like... a piece of meat. i thought, it's just his arm. but, he bled to death right there anyway.}
<A>__{a pause. somerset opens the window, feels the air on his face.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{how did the fire fight end?}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{well, i was doing really good in philly up till then. lots of simple busts. i've always had this weird luck... but, this was wild.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i got that fuck with one shot... right between the eyes. and the next week, the mayor's pinning a medal on me. picture in the paper, the whole nine yards.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{how was it?}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i expected it to be bad, because i heard about other guys. you know... i took a human life. but, i slept like a baby that night.}
<A>__{somerset eats another antacid.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i think hemingway wrote somewhere... i can't remember where, but he wrote that, in order to live in a city, you have to have the ability to kill. i think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, to survive.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{sounds like he knew what he was talking about.}
