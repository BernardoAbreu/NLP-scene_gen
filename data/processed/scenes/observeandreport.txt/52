<L>__{interior ronnie's bedroom night}
<A>__{ronnie's mom sits on his bed with a bottle of wild turkey. she waits for ronnie to come out of the closet.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{come on, ronnie, just get out here.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{it's too tight in the butt.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{let me see.}
<A>__{ronnie comes out of the closet and he's wearing a ridiculous fucking outfit. it's an imitation silk button up, with a pair of black parachute pants. there's two belts for some double belt action. he's got no socks on and a pair of white shoes. he looks like a goddamn fool.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{ronnie, you look so handsome!}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{really, you don't think i look like a phony.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{hell no. you look like a stud muffin.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yeah, i guess these clothes are kind of cool.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{nell is a lucky girl.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{its not nell, mom.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{really, i thought you and nell were going to get married some day.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i did too. but then i met this girl brandi and she swept me off my feet.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{well, i always liked nell, but as long as you're happy, ronnie, that's all i care about.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i actually feel kind of bad about nell, but i figure that i can pour all the sadness into brandi and just really rely on her for my happiness instead of nell.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{that sounds wonderful. is she pretty?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{she is, mom. she's the most perfect girl in the whole world.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{i remember when your father picked me up for our first date. i swear he was the most handsome man that i had ever laid eyes on. i knew right then and there that this would be the man that i married.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i hope that happens tonight.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{it will, ronnie. then you'll have to give her a ring like the one your father gave me.}
<A>__{ronnie's mom holds up her finger for ronnie. it's a giant yellow cottony looking diamond ring.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{is that a yellow diamond?}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{it's a glass diamond. this is how it looks now.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{mom, why did dad leave?}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{well, he kind of freaked out when you were born. you had so many special needs that he just couldn't handle the pressure. one day, he just couldn't take it anymore.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{do you think it was my fault that dad left?}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{definitely. you don't think it was mine do you?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{well, i didn't know, with the drinking and all.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{nope, it was all you.}
<A>__{ronnie nods.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{i love you, ronnie.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i love you, too, mom.}
