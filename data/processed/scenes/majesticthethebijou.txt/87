<B>__{the door.}

<C>__{luke}
<D>__{um, old tim? sorry, it's late. it's luke. can i come in?}
<A>__{the humming stops, and after a moment, the door swings open, revealing old tim, a pipe in his mouth, holding the cat, stroking its fur.}
<C>__{old tim}

<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yeah. i hope you don't mind. i didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides harry. and me.}
