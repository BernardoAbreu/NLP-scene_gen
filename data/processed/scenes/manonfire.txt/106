<L>__{2nd floor window}
<A>__{the curtains rustle in the breeze. the sound of badly played scales. and then sounds of frustration. then, the sound of the teacher playing. pinta appears in the window for just a moment.}
<B>__{creasy}
<A>__{looking up from the window of the mercedes. as pinta is called back inside, creasy checks out, twirls the dandelion pinta gave him. hums to himself. "blue bayou."}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{the street}
<A>__{creasy leaning against the mercedes. traffic pounding by. the dandelion is stuck in a button hole of his shirt. and then suddenly traffic thins out. reminiscent of the previous two kidnappings. it's a process. creasy straightens up. a judicial police car cruises by, slowly. creasy makes eye contact with the two cops up front. the same guys who were at zona rosa. creasy starts across the street toward the apartment building. at the same time as... the door bangs open. pinta exiting. she spots creasy, a huge grin on her face. she was not accepted. and a white toyota corolla coming the other way. the police car reverses back, cutting creasy off from pinta. the cops getting out, big smiles on their faces.}
<B>__{the corolla}
<A>__{slides to a stop in front of pinta, blocking her path to creasy. and as two men leap out from the backseat...}
<C>__{creasy}
<P>__{(drawing his 9mm)}
<D>__{run, pinta, run!}
<A>__{but she's rooted with fear. and the men are almost on her. creasy raises the 9mm overhead. bang! and the sound frees her. pinta runs! ducking under a flailing arm. quick and lithe. trying to reach her bodyguard. the cops drawing uzi's.. creasy plants himself, the sig sauer now level. he fires twice into cop one, dead center in the chest. pinta runs. chased by the two men. cop two returns fire wildly: the mercedes hit in a ten bullet line. creasy fires two more rounds into cop two who's hit high in the chest and throat. precise. creasy pivots, strides calmly forward, firing at the men chasing pinta. boom! boom! boom! man one goes down, hit in the ribs. a bullet slams creasy in the back, fired from inside the corolla. creasy fires back. boom! boom! man three falls dead, hit just below his nose, just above his teeth. the fat driver fires, now, and creasy is hit in the shoulder. and pinta disappears into the traffic. gone. man two, who has abandoned chasing pinta, fires again. creasy drops the 9mm as he is hit in the stomach. he falls to his knees. the dandelion starts to come apart. drifting away, piece by piece. slack jawed, creasy looks about. sees the fat driver heaving himself out of the corolla while man two scans for pinta who's nowhere in sight. she got away! creasy smiles even as he crumples over on his side.}
<C>__{pinta's voice}
<D>__{creasy!}
<A>__{and pinta is back. running toward creasy. she can't leave him like this. she was safe and now she's back.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{nooo...}
<A>__{she runs to him, wraps her arms around him.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{creasy...}
<A>__{man two catches up, tears pinta away, starts back for the sedan. creasy can only blink after them.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{creasy!}
<A>__{it's not a cry for help. it's anguish for him.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{pinta...}
<A>__{man two crams her in the back seat, follows. the fat driver gets back in behind the wheel. as the door slams shut, wheels spin, grip and the corolla accelerates away. we just see pinta look back through the rear windshield. an anguished image before she's pulled back down. creasy makes a wish. not for himself, but for her.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{don't die, creasy, don't die.}
<A>__{and everything goes very, very,}
<B>__{black}
<A>__{sound breaks through first. the whir and beep of medical equipment. and we fade back into:}
