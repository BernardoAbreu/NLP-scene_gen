<A>__{a stunning young woman appears behind gittes in his doorway. she's shortly joined by a small, gray haired man. they listen, unseen by gittes.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...and then they stop and they read a little confucius and they screw some more and they stop and they smoke some opium and then they go back and screw some more and they stop again and they contemplate the moon or something and it makes it more exciting. so this other guy goes home to screw his wife and after a while he stops and gets up and goes into the other room only he reads life magazine and he goes back and he screws some more and suddenly says excuse me a second and he gets up and smokes a cigarette and he goes back and by this time his wife is getting sore as hell. so he screws some more and then he gets up to look at the moon and his wife says, 'what the hell do you think you're doing?}
<P>__{(gittes breaks up)}
<D>__{...you're screwing like a chinaman.'}
<A>__{gittes hangs onto sophie's desk laughing his ass off. the little gray haired man winces. when gittes looks up he sees the young woman, apparently in her late twenties. she's so stunning that gittes nearly gasps.}

<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{not that mulwray?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{yes, that mulwray, mr. gittes. and since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that i haven't hired you to do anything. certainly not spy on my husband. i see you like publicity, mr. gittes. well, you're going to get it.}

<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i don't get tough with anybody, mr. gittes. my lawyer does.}
<A>__{evelyn starts out the door and gittes starts after her. this time he's stopped by the gray haired man who has also come out of his office and up behind him.}
<D>__{gray haired man here's something for you, mr. gittes.}
<A>__{gittes turns to be handed a thick sheaf of papers, a summons and complainterior evelyn walks out the door.}
<D>__{gray haired man}
