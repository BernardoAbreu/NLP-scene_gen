<L>__{exterior oasis continuous}
<A>__{a protected rock oasis, heavy vegetation crawling up the encircling cliff walls, herds of sheep grazing on fields of grass. at its far end, beyond a deep blue pond, lies a greek influenced monastery and several tiled roof, mud brick houses. and moving between the pools are men and women going about their simple chores. they wear long flowing white linen robes and turbans. the air and sand are perfectly still within the perimeter of the oasis. but beyond it, the sandstorm rages all around, sand hurled violently hundreds of feet into the air, swirling around the oasis as though it were the eye of some mystical hurricane, protected by an unseen force. a row of robed young women kneel in front of one of the reflecting pools, quietly reading from prayer books and softly striking their right breast with a left hands wrapped in thorns. one girl, ilira, mischievously taps the shoulder of the girl next to her with her thorn. the girl, tamara, squeals in pain, angry her prayer was interrupted. ilira is the fun loving dilettante of the relationship. tamara the studious good girl.}

<D>__{is that how one shows penitence?}
<A>__{both girls instantly stop as fassir appears behind them. fassir is an elder monk and leader of the monastery. he shakes his head, both out of fondness and disappointment.}

<C>__{ilira}
<D>__{i'm sorry, fassir. i just tire of saying the same prayer every day.}
<C>__{fassir}
<D>__{then you should be able to translate it from its original acheronian.}
<A>__{ilira's face scrunches, unsure. tamara steps in to help ilira save face.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{of course she can. she even taught it to me. "never again."}
<C>__{fassir}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{never again will we stand by as darkness consumes the world. never again will innocents suffer for others' power. never again will the queen suffer so acheron may rise.}
<C>__{fassir}
<D>__{very good, tamara. you must have taught her very well indeed, ilira.}
<A>__{a smile on fassir's face confirms he knows the truth. suddenly, the monastery's bell rings out. a moment later, a temple explodes in flames. pouring out from the swirling sands come khalar singh's army. cheren and his archers stand atop khalar's}

<A>__{a massive siege engine atop which cheren and his archers fire flaming arrows. the arrows arc down and explode as they impact the tiled roofs. sitting at the highest point of the man of war, khalar singh likes what he sees.}
<B>__{chaos}
<A>__{the monks scatter in every direction, but wherever they turn, more troops burst out of the swirling sand. a small handful of armed monks display acrobatic martial arts prowess as they battle with khalar's heavily armed forces, but they are vastly outnumbered. fassir grabs tamara.}

<D>__{the queen must not be captured. take her out the north gate. quickly!}
<A>__{tamara grabs ilira and pulls her through the flaming battleground. zingaran warriors cut down the monks while turanian horsemen concentrate on the women.}

<D>__{we can't leave them.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{if you are caught, everything we live for is lost!}
<A>__{whip! a whip encircles ilira's waist. a massive turanian pulls her to him. tamara grabs the whip, pulling ilira the other way. but she is no match for the huge slaver. he yanks on the whip pulling both of them to him only then does he notice tamara's unsheathed knife which she plunges into his throat. she frees ilira and they run.}
