<L>__{interior castle hallway day}
<A>__{indy leads henry down the hallway as he searches for elsa.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{elsa? elsa?}
<A>__{he opens a door and enters:}
<L>__{interior first castle room day}
<A>__{indy and henry rush back into the room where elsa had been left, only to find: a nazi colonel holding elsa hostage. his name is vogel: a vicious looking, lantern jawed brute. one arm is wrapped around elsa's waist, the other hand presses the muzzle of a luger behind her ear.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{that's far enough put down the gun, doctor jones. put down the gun or the fraulein dies.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{but she's one of them!}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{indy, please!}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{she's a nazi!}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{indy is thrown. he doesn't know what to do. he looks at elsa, then back to his father. everyone is yelling at once:}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{trust me!}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{indy, no!}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{i will kill her!}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{oh yeah? go ahead!}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{no! don't shoot!}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(to indy)}
<D>__{don't worry. he won't.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{indy, please! do what he says!}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{and don't listen to her!}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{enough! she diesl}
<A>__{vogel jams the barrel of the luger painfully into elsa's neck. elsa screams.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{wait! waitl}
<A>__{and then indy gives in. he drops the machine gun to the table and it slides across, shattering glass. henry groans audibly. vogel releases his grip on elsa and shoves her toward indy. she is propelled directly into his arms. he holds her tightly. she buries her face in his chest.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{indy comforts her.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{no, don't be.}
<A>__{her hand slips into his coat pocket and removes the grail diary.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{but you should have listened to your father.}
<A>__{she steps back next to vogel. indy is stunned. henry gives him his most withering look of reprimand.}
