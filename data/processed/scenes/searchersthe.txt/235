<A>__{camera pans from the top of the rock chimney to where martin is snaking his way through, carrying newly filled water canteens. he stands there, listening and looking back the way he has come; and then, satisfied there has been no pursuit, he continues away.}
<L>__{interior the cave med. shot ethan half light}
<A>__{ethan is lying on the hard earth, perhaps cushioned with some boughs. he is half delirious. a small fire is burning. martin enters carrying the canteens. he looks unsympathetically toward ethan, then continues to the fire, takes a knife and starts to sterilize it. ethan gasps, mumbles and then a word comes clear.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{martha... martha!}
<A>__{martin stares at him and now, perhaps for the first time, he is fitting pieces into the jig saw puzzle. he shifts closer to ethan and we see he is preparing to dig out the bullet. ethan opens his eyes and looks at him.}

<D>__{i gotta open that leg and let the poison out...}
<A>__{he poises the knife.}

<P>__{(a shout)}
<D>__{shut your dirty mouth!}
<A>__{he gets to his feet, trembling, and stands looking down at ethan, his fists clenched at his sides and murder in his eyes. then his eyes rove to the knife lying on the blanket. he picks it up and he looks again at the wounded man.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{i hope you die!}
<A>__{and he kneels again to open the wound.}
