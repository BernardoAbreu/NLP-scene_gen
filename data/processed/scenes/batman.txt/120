<L>__{interior batcave night}
<A>__{we all know this place. although we haven't had time to acquire the familiar mementos the dinosaur, the giant penny the batcave is unmistakable. vast banks of blinking computers. a state of the art crime lab. a fully equipped workshop for hammering out new toys. it's the biggest and best secret clubhouse a boy could wish for. batman climbs out of the car. he removes his cape, strips off his bullet riddled jersey and his body armor. there are two big bruises on the center of his chest. vicki looks on as he goes to a rack along one wall and picks out a fresh tunic one of four. she wanders over to examine the row of bat suits and the body armor.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{what is this stuff? kevlar?}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{better. it's not on the market yet.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{it doesn't protect your head, though.}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{that's why i wear a target on my chest.}
<A>__{the batman takes obvious pleasure in showing her his futuristic bachelor's pad. his tone is jokey, almost flirtatious. behind the mask, he's a lot looser, more carefree, than some guys we could name... ... like bruce wayne. vicki is, to put it mildly, awed. she wanders around gaping at millions of dollars' worth of equipment.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{how'd you find this place?}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{stumbled across it when i was a boy.}
<A>__{vicki's head jerks up abruptly. in the dim recesses overhead, bats are screaming. she shivers.}
<C>__{batman }
<D>__{they don't come down here. they're afraid of the lights.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{i don't like bats. not that kind.}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{they used to terrify me. but i forced myself to keep coming back, and }
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{ i guess i became the thing i feared the most. i will do your photos now.}
<A>__{he goes to a high speed photo processing machine the kind they have at fotomat, only better and loads the roll. vicki wanders over to the edge of a deep black pit. she kicks a pebble over. long seconds pass; no sound. she looks up. suspended over the bottomless pit are a pair of gymnast's rings. this guy is dedicated.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{who pays for all this?}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{i have sponsors.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{the computers?}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{i'm running a check on the tainted products. there is a pattern. beauty products. personal hygiene.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{no more makeup. looks like we'll all be showing our true faces now.}
<A>__{she looks straight at him. it's almost a direct request. but batman is preoccupied with the matter at hand.}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{i've tracked all the records. every shipment, every warehouse, every loading dock. nothing. no opportunities for tampering. somehow the joker is supplying tainted ingredients... at the source.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{wait. you can just tap into any corporate database you want? anywhere?}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{oh, no. i let the fbi do that. then i tap into the fbi. your photos are ready.}
<A>__{he holds up a hand to vicki: stand back. then he checks out the pictures smiling as he shuffles through the prints.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{you could've killed him, you know. you could have killed the joker.}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{i had to save you, vicki.}
<P>__{(turning to face her)}
<D>__{here you go. i think i will let you keep the whole set.}
<A>__{she looks at the photos. joker. joker. joker. and four shots of the batman in action. he's without his mask, but there's no clean angle on his face. vicki doesn't quite know why, but her head is reeling.}
<C>__{batman }
<D>__{care for an autograph?}
<A>__{he takes one of the prints, scrawls on it, hands it to her with the inscription: "to vicki. love, b." now he turns to shut down the photo machine. vicki is trembling. her hand goes to her belt, finds the telephoto roll concealed in her blouse. she steps up silently behind him, reaches for his cowl. at the last second... she stops.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{... bruce?}
<A>__{he freezes in place for an indecisive moment. then:}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{are you talking to me?}
<A>__{he turns in seeming incomprehension. and shows her a smile... the same crooked, curious, childlike smile she saw on bruce's face that morning when she caught him singing.}
<C>__{batman }
<D>__{maybe we've had enough for one night. i will take you home.}
<A>__{almost in a trance now, she lets him lead her to the batmobile. as she takes her seat he reaches into his utility belt for another knockout capsule.}
<C>__{batman }
<D>__{do you want to do it this time?}
<A>__{vicki doesn't move. she looks at the capsule in her hand as he walks over to the driver's side and gets in.}
<C>__{batman }
<D>__{don't be afraid. i'm here.}
<A>__{she takes one last look at the familiar smile beneath the mask... then breaks the capsule and breathes deep. flame erupts from the rear of the batmobile as the after burners kick in and batman screeches off. a fiery red glow fills the screen, burning out the image as we}
