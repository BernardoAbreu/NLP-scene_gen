<L>__{ext nite: funeral parlor alley (spring 1946)}
<A>__{the tires of a car roll very quietly along the small alley; we notice a dark car approach the rear of bonasera's funeral parlor. clemenza gets out, and moves to the open, rear door. bonasera greets him, too petrified to speak. he notices two other men get out of the car, and carry a stretcher with a corpse swaddled in a gray blanket, with yellowed feet protruding. bonasera closes his eyes in fear, but indicates which way the men should carry their sinister burden.}
