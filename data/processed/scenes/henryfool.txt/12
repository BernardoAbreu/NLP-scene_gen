<L>__{exterior junk yard day}
<A>__{later that day. simon finds a number of volumes of the classics while crushing garbage.}
<L>__{exterior behind world of donuts day}
<A>__{that evening. simon sits with his evening beer and his new collection of soiled classics. he cracks open a volume of shakespeare and tries to read. it's an obvious struggle. he puts it aside and lifts up wordsworth, studying its cover and the texture of the pages. a page flutters away and he climbs down to the edge of a greasy puddle to retrieve it. it's now wet and torn, so he flattens it out on the concrete and tries to fit it back into the book. he reads a little, furrowing his brow, then drinks. he bites his lip and tries again. he sits back, exhausted and thinks. he hears a twig snap and looks back over his shoulder to see... amy throws a bottle at his head. smash!!!! he falls to the ground, blood streaming down his neck. warren runs over and grabs him by the shirt, lifting him out of the puddle and smacking him in the head. amy runs forward and waits with a rolled up newspaper which she sets aflame with her lighter. warren punches simon in the stomach and throws him to the ground, then unzips his fly and pisses on him. amy watches, giggling excitedly, waving the flaming torch. simon crawls away and grabs hold of an old section of fence, while warren zips up and grabs the fire from amy. simon pulls himself to his knees, rests his face against the rusted fence and gasps for breath. warren waves the flaming torch in his face.}

<A>__{warren stops. amy steps back and lowers the gas can. simon turns with effort to face them, adjusts his glasses and continues...}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{one of you. i promise.}
<A>__{warren watches him blankly, then is burned by the torch which is too hot to handle. he drops it. amy giggles, then stops, excited, but confused. simon grips the rusted chainlink so that it cuts into his hands and stares straight at warren.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{you can set me on fire. but one of you is gunna have an eye torn out of your head. i promise.}
<A>__{warren is transfixed. he shivers and looks at amy, who steps back, scared, and puts down the gas can. she turns and walks away. warren looks back at simon, troubled. he hangs there still, glaring at him. further away, warren rejoins amy and stares at his hands. amy looks ill.}
