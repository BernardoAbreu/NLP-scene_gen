<L>__{interior other house hallway same}
<A>__{it's dark and stable in here, with just some creaks and intermittent vibrations. a poisonous green light spills from the other living room. coraline goes there, carrying the cat over her shoulder, past wallpaper that peels up as she passes, to the room where she last heard the sound of her mother's finger on glass.}
<L>__{interior other living room same}
<A>__{a poisonous green fire like sleepy sea snakes burns in the fireplace. the bug furniture looks grey now, their lights flickering as if short circuited; legs and wings twitching uncontrollably. coraline scans the walls, the ceiling, looking for a sign of her parents. angle on coraline in foreground. she senses the other mother behind her, a creature who is no sort of mother at all but a witch, a beldam. she turns. the beldam is hunched on the sofa her face hidden.}
<C>__{beldam}
<D>__{so, you're back....}
<A>__{her voice sounds dry and tired. she turns her face towards coraline. it is a white death mask, cracked and peeling her true face.}
<C>__{beldam }
<D>__{and you brought vermin with you.}
<A>__{coraline shudders and steps back. the cat makes a fearful sound and digs his claws into her shoulder.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{no, i ... i brought a friend.}
<A>__{the beldam rises up 12 feet tall. she is withered to the bone; with plate like shoulders and hips; her bustle now an arachnid's tail section. her true form. she reaches her long, sharp fingers made of needles to coraline's face.}
<C>__{beldam}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{you know i love you.}
<A>__{coraline works hard to not show how freaked out she is.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{you, you have a very funny way of showing it.}
<A>__{the beldam smiles, turns away, then back, her hand outstretched.}
<C>__{beldam}
<D>__{so? where are they the ghost eyes?}
<A>__{coraline pulls out the three spheres from her bag and starts to hand them over. but she catches herself.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{hold on.}
<A>__{and pulls back.}
<C>__{coraline }
<D>__{we aren't finished yet, are we?}
<A>__{the beldam looks daggers, then smiles sweetly.}
<C>__{beldam}
<D>__{no, i suppose not. after all, you still need to find your old parents, don't you? too bad you won't have this.}
<A>__{she produces the triangle candy that coraline lost and flings it into the green fire. the beldam laughs while the magic burns out of the candy with sparks and pops. on coraline. the third ghost eye pulses with amber light in her hand. coraline turns away, so the witch won't see.}
<C>__{sweet girl ghost }
<D>__{be clever, miss; even if you win she'll never let you go!}
<A>__{coraline looks towards the locked little door behind the armoire bug and understands: she's got to get the beldam to unlock it! she furrows her brow as an idea comes to her then nods. she turns to the witch and in the most confident tone she can muster, says:}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{i already know where you've hidden them.}
<A>__{the beldam turns from the fire, both concerned and sceptical.}
<C>__{beldam}
<D>__{well... produce them.}
<A>__{coraline points to the little door.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{they're behind that door.}
<A>__{the beldam leans close, knowing coraline is wrong, and speaks very quietly.}
<C>__{beldam}
<D>__{oh, they are, are they?}
<A>__{a smile creeps onto her terrible face. and she starts towards the little door, moving in an odd, laboring way, as if she had four legs instead of two. she signals the armoire bug to stand aside, her back to coraline. coraline hears the soft chirp of her mother's finger on wet glass! looks around, desperate where is it coming from?! the cat's ears twitch and focus, and then he sees something on the mantel!. he whispers to coraline }
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{there!}
<A>__{ and jumps to land beside the detroit zoo snow globe }
<B>__{opaque with frost.}
<A>__{c.u. on snow globe. with a soft chirp, a section of glass is wiped clear from inside by a tiny forearm and we see the tiny, cold figures that are coraline's trapped parents! coraline's heart races. she purposely stays back from them.}
<C>__{coraline}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{mom. dad!}
<A>__{on beldam, by little door. oblivious to coraline's discovery, she coughs up the key into her hand. she turns to coraline, expectantly.}
<C>__{coraline }
<D>__{go on. open it. they'll be there, all right.}
<A>__{the beldam stoops to push the key into the lock, turns it, leaves the key in place. she grins at coraline and speaks in a low, sing song voice.}
<C>__{beldam}
<D>__{you're wrong, coraline!}
<A>__{she opens the little door, revealing the empty, spider web tunnel. on coraline, who glances from the open door to the cat obscured on the mantel and back to the beldam. she's thinking very hard.}
<C>__{beldam }
<P>__{(pitying)}
<D>__{they aren't there.}
<A>__{she opens her hands: one holds box with coraline's black button eyes, the other a threaded needle. triumphant, the beldam softly gloats:}
<C>__{beldam }
<D>__{now you're going to stay here forever.}
<A>__{coraline strikes a warrior's pose, and, summons all the fury she can.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{no ... i'm ...}
<A>__{she grabs the cat off the mantel and raises him over her}
<B>__{head.}
<C>__{coraline }
<D>__{not!}
<A>__{and she hurls the cat at the beldam. the yowling animal face shocked with surprise sails through the air and lands right on the astonished witch's head. freaked out, the cat digs in his claws and bites the shrieking beldam, who staggers to one side of the little door. coraline grabs the snow globe with her parents inside, stows it in her bag, and moves out to approach the door from the other side. the beldam flails wildly at the cat. the cat howls like a banshee, raises his claws, and quick as you can two shiny black buttons hit the floor the beldam's eyes! angle on cat as he's thrown on armoire bug. on beldam, hands covering her face.}
<C>__{beldam}
<D>__{nooooooooo!}
<A>__{her hands pull away to show empty, flat sockets and torn thread!}
<C>__{beldam }
<D>__{you horrible cheating girl!}
<A>__{she furiously stomps the floor which flies up in a spiral of floorboards that drive coraline to the room's center. a huge web trap lies beneath the floor! the web trap stretches down into a fifty foot deep pit. there is nothing beyond but pale nothingness. the cat scrambles along the tops of falling furniture straight to the little door and disappears into the tunnel. coraline falls the very bottom of the web. fifty feet above, the beldam laughs maniacally and leaps down like a huge, flying spider! coraline manages to pull herself to the outside of the trap just as the beldam lands. the witch furious her prey has escaped spins around, grasping blindly.}
<C>__{beldam }
<D>__{noo!! where are you? you selfish brat!!}
<A>__{coraline, nearing the top, looks up and spots the little door, still in the corner wall of the other living room. she goes to climb back inside the web, when her bag gets caught on a barb. she pulls and pulls until it breaks free, sending a strong vibration down the spiraling web}
<B>__{to the very sensitive hand of the beldam.}
<C>__{beldam }
<D>__{hahahaha...}
<A>__{the beldam smiles she knows where her prey is now! coraline makes it to the little door, but the beldam is coming up behind her very fast!}
<D>__{beldam (o.s.) (cont'd) you ... dare ...}
