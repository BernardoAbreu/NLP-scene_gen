<L>__{interior chimera public room moments later day}
<A>__{a doll's white face, eyes haunting and coldly blue, stares into the middle distance. it lies on a love seat as epps steps up. she lifts it. several other toys lie scattered about as she studies it, when the sound of a ticking clock}
<B>__{can be heard.}
<A>__{a beat as epps holds there. she turns, trying to locate the sound. from across the room, epps stands, listening. as the ticking clock sounds from here. she turns, putting down the doll, holding a beat. she approaches, crossing the room, coming finally to a stop before us and what we come to see is an ancient grandfather clock. all but it's minute hand has fallen off its corroded face, but from inside it emits a weak though steady ticking. epps stands there as the clock ticks, looking on, when the ticking ceases. a beat as she holds there, as the clock faces her, now silent.}
