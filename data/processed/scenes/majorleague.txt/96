<C>__{brown}
<P>__{(addressing the group)}
<D>__{i got somethin' i think you oughta know about. i wouldn't have known about it myself if charlie donovan hadn't told me, although i shoulda guessed it from everything that's happened. it seems that mrs. phelps doesn't think too highly of our worth.}
<A>__{we take several cuts of faces around the room.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{she put this team together because she thought we'd be bad enough to finish dead last, knockin' attendance down to the point where she could move the team to miami.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{and get rid of all of us for better personnel.}
<A>__{taylor, vaughn, hayes, dorn, and the others can hardly believe what they're hearing.}
<C>__{dorn}
<D>__{even me?}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{even you, dorn.}
<A>__{silence descends on the room.}
<C>__{hayes}

<D>__{that's about it.}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{what if we don't finish last?}

<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i don't know about the rest of you, but i've been playin' baseball since i was five years old. i've had some good years and some years to forget. i've burned out my knees... i don't think i have three fingers that work right... i've lost most of the money i made and baseball has messed up my personal life from time to time. but i know one thing... i can still play this game a little. and i'd like to know who in this room thinks they're the kinda bum mrs. phelps is lookin' for?}
<A>__{eyes dart around the room, then come back to taylor. no hands are raised...}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{well, then, i guess there's only one thing to do.}
<C>__{dorn}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{win the whole fuckin' thing.}

<A>__{hanging a full size blowup of rachel phelps on the locker room wall. in the picture she's pointing as if out at the players, and a bubble above her head says, "you guys stink!" a set of designer clothes, of the type rachel wears, have been superimposed on the picture. the clothes are divided into 32 pull off squares.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i figure it's gonna take 32 more victories to win this thing. every time we win, we peel a square.}
<B>__{hayes}
<A>__{coming out of an elevator in the turk, with a wheelbarrow full of dirt. we pan him down the hall, where we see a dirt sliding area he's been building up.}
<B>__{hayes}
<A>__{leading off a makeshift base in the hall of the turk. as vaughn tosses a ball up in the air, hayes takes off down the hall toward another base on the dirt sliding area. vaughn catches the ball and rifles a throw down to taylor, who puts the tag on the sliding hayes. cerrano, who's umping, calls hayes out. hayes jumps up and argues vociferously, hopping around in frustration.}
