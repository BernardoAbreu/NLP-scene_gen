We make the big money off our client list.  You see, when a client wins with our advice we take a percentage, which they gladly give to keep getting our picks.  When they lose we get zip.  So the object here, my tall, athletic, religious friend -- is to win. WALTER clicks a control and his face fills the wall of tvs. Phone numbers and messages ("FOOTBALL SELECTIONS!" COLLEGE AND PRO!"
