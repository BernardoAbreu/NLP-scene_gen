<L>__{interior rear hallway}
<A>__{as pete joins doc. silently, motionlessly, the two men stare for a long moment at hector particularly at the pistol lying beside him. then they look at each other, and the same thought seems to flash in their minds...}
<T>__{quick dissolve:}
<L>__{exterior road macreedy and liz}
<A>__{as they speed down the long empty ribbon of road. liz drives hard. macreedy turns in the bucket seat, looking back toward black rock.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{sorry i can't get more out of this heap.}
<A>__{macreedy does not answer.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(with a burst of irritation)}
<D>__{we could make better time with a dog team.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{you're doing the best you can.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{aren't you, liz?}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{don't expect too much from me.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{don't worry, i won't.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{i mean, people have always expected things from me. you know why? because i'm pretty. well, that's not enough.}
<A>__{med. shot jeep with liz and macreedy as she cuts sharply into a crossroad. she drives skillfully over the knotty road which is little more than a trail. her lovely features are distorted with her discontent and the ache for attention. after a moment she gives voice to her fantasy...}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{maybe i could have been something a model, or something.}
<P>__{(glancing at him)}
<D>__{you don't believe that.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{yes i do.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{well, i don't, really. i'm a dime a dozen.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{that i don't believe.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{i'm too little and too late.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{it's never too late.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{i lack the muscle.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(frowning)}
<D>__{why is muscle so important?}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(cynically)}
<D>__{oh, you're the brainy type.}
<P>__{(harshly)}
<D>__{did it take brains to rough up coley? whatever you did to hector, you didn't do it with brains. how'd you get pete to change his mind?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{not with muscle.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{and not with brains, either. he's a pushover for a muscle man.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{i'm beginning' to think it runs in the family.}
<P>__{(looking at her hard)}
<D>__{you think strength is in the width of a man's shoulders.}
<A>__{he does not catch the glance she darts him; his extreme awareness is anchored not to the girl at his side but to the terrain ahead.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{i'd sure have liked to see you tangle with reno smith.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{he wasn't around when i left... maybe i will yet.}
<A>__{his eyes strain to sweep the country each boulder, each outcropping, each stunted tree. but substance and shadow are blurred and fuzzy in the dark night, black on black.}
<B>__{out}
<A>__{sequence from original script. another angle jeep with macreedy and liz as it winds to the far end of the boulders on a trail that drops off into a flat basin. solid forms loom up in the darkness; they are unrecognizable, yet macreedy senses some tense familiarity with the terrain... he frowns. suddenly liz brakes the jeep so sharply macreedy lurches forward in the seat.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(alert, expectant)}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(vamping nervously)}
<D>__{we need water...}
<P>__{(she turns off engine,}
<D>__{pulling ignition key}
<P>__{from its lock)}
<D>__{...radiator's overheating.}
<A>__{she moves away from macreedy to get out of the jeep. he reaches across quickly, gripping her arm. she turns to face him, disturbed by his hardness of jaw and eye...}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{leggo! leggo of me!}
<A>__{suddenly they are hit by a blinding pair of headlights like [...] the beams cut jaggedly through the night, throwing into sharp immediate relief the lava rocks, the broken windmill, the gutted house, the litter strewn, unmarked grave at adobe flat. liz throws away the ignition key. macreedy bails out of the jeep, still holding the girl. close two shot liz and macreedy as they fall to the earth. macreedy pins her down. then in quick succession, four emphatically loud shots from a rifle squirt into the shale around them.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(harshly, through his teeth)}
<D>__{you're stupid, liz. you're a fool. if he finishes me, he's got to finish you.}
<A>__{he looks up blindly into the headlights glaring from the granitic high ground some 60 yards away. his grip on the girl's shoulder is like a steel trap. he pushes her down beside komako's grave, hugging the side of the jeep as a shot rips the gravel at their feet. pulling the girl with him, he takes cover in the slight concavity of the grave. the jeep is between them and the headlights between them and the source of the gunfire. liz struggles to break away. suddenly bullets kick up a storm around him. a bullet smashes into the flowers, exploding tiny cruel fragments of dirt into macreedy's face. he gasps in pain, releasing liz. he rubs his eyes as if to convince himself that he is not blind. liz breaks from the grave. now, five yards from macreedy...}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(calling toward the headlights)}
<D>__{smitty! smitty!}
<C>__{smith's voice}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{i'm here, honey. just head for the car.}
<A>__{liz half turns, facing macreedy with a vicious smile...}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(an almost bantering voice)}
<D>__{so long, macreedy.}
<A>__{she starts toward the headlights.}
<B>__{go with liz}
<A>__{she reaches the foot of the rocky ridge, with the two enormous eyes on top. she begins to climb, up... up...}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{just a few more steps, honey.}
<A>__{she is almost at the top; a vertically sheer rock about five feet high separates her from it. she looks up at smith, towering over her at the edge of the precipice. he holds his rifle almost languorously.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(breathlessly)}
<D>__{get him! get him now!}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(easily)}
<D>__{first things first, honey.}
<A>__{the girl is frightened by the menace in smith's voice.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(unsure, reaching out her hand)}
<D>__{help me up, smitty.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{you were going to help me, liz.}
<P>__{(she looks at him quizzically)}
<D>__{i still need your help.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{i did what you said...}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{you two started out in a car. that's the way you'll end up. over a cliff, burning.}
<P>__{(she tries to interrupt}
<D>__{him, but he goes}
<P>__{on...)}
<D>__{you can blame that on macreedy, too. he said i had too many witnesses.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(dry whisper)}
<D>__{but why me? why start with me?}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{i got to start with somebody.}
<A>__{he brings the rifle down, aiming almost casually at liz. her eyes go wide. she steps back, spins around, running crazily down the steep incline.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(yelling wildly)}
<D>__{macreedy! macreedy!}
<A>__{a shot rings out. she falls forward, rolling slowly down the embankment. she lies there. blood trickles from the corner of her pretty mouth. a rattling noise rises from deep in her throat, and then subsides. in the silence the outline of reno smith emerges. holding his rifle at the ready, his silhouette illuminated sharply in the twin beams of light, he climbs down the side of the cliff. he looks toward the jeep and macreedy, not once at the girl at his feet.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(sadly, almost reproachfully)}
<D>__{you shouldn't have done that...}
<A>__{smith pays no attention to her. he advances inexorably with rifle held at his hip. he fires at macreedy.}
