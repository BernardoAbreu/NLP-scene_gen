<L>__{interior taxi afternoon}
<A>__{as the cab bounces down a cobblestone village street, wills and charlotte stare straight ahead, each following the tortuous path of his own thoughts. slowly, charlotte steals a sidelong look at him. his face is tense, ashen, and unreadable }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{wills slowly turns his head. she smiles sweetly }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{look on the bright side: if i weren't sick, there's no way we could hang out together.}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{i'm serious. you'd be scared of hurting me and i'd be scared you were just using me for my perfect young body.}
<A>__{he can't help but smile. encouraged, she moves closer }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{and then our friends would say we were just into each other for weird psychological reasons. you know, because i'm looking for a daddy substitute and you're looking for someone you can feel superior to so you won't have to confront how scared you are of real intimacy and, of course, they'd be right and eventually we'd break up.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but since i'm so sick it doesn't really matter what deep seated weirdness has brought us together because there's no way we can possibly screw each other over... or up... because that takes time. and i don't have much left.}
<A>__{the cab comes to a stop in front of her brownstone. she smiles archly, savoring the irony }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{so considering everything, don't you think we should just sort of chill out, forget i'm sick, and enjoy what we have... right now... no strings... just this... until it ends? 'cause that's really all i have to offer.}
<A>__{wills grimly appreciates the irony.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{think about it, okay? but not too hard.}
<A>__{she kisses his cheek and jumps out of the cab. she skips up the steps of the brownstone, then immediately turns around and runs back down to the open window. she leans in and mutters sexily }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{last night was so incredibly hot.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{by the way it was my first time. and i picked you for the job. i hope you're flattered.}
<A>__{wills is shocked. she turns and runs back upstairs. she sticks in the key, then turns and waves at wills before banging open the door with her hip.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{okay, pal, where to?}
<A>__{wills hasn't moved a muscle. from the next scene, we hear the pop of flashbulbs and the whirr of shutters }
