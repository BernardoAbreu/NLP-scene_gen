<L>__{interior hayden planetarium night}
<A>__{stars on the ceiling. a voice drones about the galaxy. in the last row, we find: reed and sue. reed is thinking about work.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{i could get ben to tap into the baxter's main power to generate enough voltage }
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{reed. shh. just be quiet. and look up.}
<A>__{he slowly looks up. the stars seem to calm him.}
<C>__{sue }
<D>__{remember our first date here...? god, i was so nervous.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{you were?}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{of course i was. i'd read all your papers on bioethics. some of them two times just so i'd have something to say to you.}
<A>__{reed smiles softly, thinking back.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{you know, i bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{i gave him twenty.}
<A>__{they laugh. sue looks up to the stars. quiet:}
<C>__{sue }
<D>__{i didn't want that night to end.}
<A>__{reed looks at her. wrestles with a decision. then quietly:}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{sue, you were right. it wasn't complicated. i just wasn't ready to be...to become...}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{you can be a little intimidating.}
<A>__{she knows. he trails off. sue looks at him.}
<C>__{reed }
<D>__{you always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind. one who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{i did. i did, reed...but i wanted you to be that man.}
<A>__{someone shushes them. they slump down further. closer.}
<C>__{sue }
<D>__{when i walked out, i waited ten minutes outside your door. ten. waiting for you to come find me.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{why didn't you say something?}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{that would have kinda defeated the purpose. and reed...}
<P>__{(closer, emotional)}
<D>__{i'm saying it now.}
<A>__{their eyes lock. a heated beat. no more secrets. their faces are close. a kiss is coming. closer, closer. sue disappears.}
<C>__{sue }
<P>__{(quiet, playful)}
<D>__{come find me.}
<A>__{reed tentatively leans into the kiss, and...}
<D>__{sue (o.s.) (cont'd) that's my nose, genius... these are my lips.}
<A>__{reed's face is squeezed on both sides by sue's invisible hands. she pulls him into a kiss. lips touch. soft, tender. stars twinkle. and we slowly dissolve to : }
