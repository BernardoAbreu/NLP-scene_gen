<L>__{interior springwood mental center moments later}
<A>__{the cries of the insane echo through the building as the security guard escorts meagan and stormie down a row of cell doors. he stops at one, tapping lightly on the glass.}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{yo, erwin... you've got a couple of visitors. now be a good boy...}
<P>__{(to meagan & stormie)}
<D>__{you've got five minutes. i will be right down the hall if you need me.}
<A>__{the guard exits. meagan and stormie peer through the thick window erwin's padded cell appears vacant. they exchange anxious looks, then meagan presses a little closer to the glass.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{erwin...?}
<A>__{splat! erwin suddenly presses his horribly burned face to the glass as he screams:}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{show me your arms! your arms!}
<A>__{meagan and stormie jump back, startled. then they quickly bare their arms, turning them over for erwin's inspection.}
<C>__{erwin}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{where do you shoot?}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{shoot?}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{he's talking about dream dope the stuff the cultists shoot up with so they can talk to freddy.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{i don't do drugs.}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{you're not in the cult?}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{didn't freddy send you to kill me? meagan stormie no.}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{i don't trust you... better take off your clothes so i can check you for tracks.}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{chill, erwin. we're here for some hard data not a floppy disk.}
<A>__{erwin flops the arms of his straight jacket, gesturing to the inside of his cell empty except for a small mattress.}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{well, what do you want? can't you see i'm busy?}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{freddy's cult kidnapped my sister.}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{i told her you might know where they took her.}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{i already told the cops everything i know.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{tell me... please.}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{look... i'm sorry about your sister, but i've got my own problems with freddy. i'm a marked man, you know.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{then tell me why they took her...}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{to bear his child. freddy wants to be human again. in order to do that he has to be "reborn".}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{how can he do that?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{he has to marry a virgin on holy ground. then the cult consumate the marriage by impregnating her.}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{the whole cult? yeech!}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{freddy's the son of a hundred maniacs. it's sort of a tradition with him.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{so the cult gets lizzy pregnant?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{and freddy enters the soul of the fetus through a dream state. voila! rebirth.}
<A>__{there is a moment as the girls take this in, then:}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{that's the stupidest shit i ever heard.}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{hey, they're not my rules... some body else wrote 'em.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{erwin... you've got to help me find lizzy. you're my only hope.}
<A>__{erwin thinks about this for a second, then:}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{i will help you find your sister, but you've got to help me.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{anything. just name it.}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{you have to help me kill freddy.}
<A>__{meagan and stormie exchange looks.}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{but freddy's dead.}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{freddy lives...}
<P>__{(looks at meagan)}
<D>__{if only in our dreams.}
<A>__{stormie grabs meagan by the arm and starts to pull her away.}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{come on, meagan... our five minutes is up. he's giving me the creeps.}
<A>__{but meagan stays put and asks erwin:}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{how can you kill a dream?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{when it's not a dream.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{do we have a deal?}
<A>__{erwin presses his palm against the glass. meagan thinks a moment, then puts her hand against the glass over his.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{deal.}
