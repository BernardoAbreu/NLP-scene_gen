<A>__{when homer comes in, rose rose is throwing up in the sink.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{you okay, rose?}
<C>__{rose rose}
<D>__{i guess you must like watchin' me be sick...}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{i don't like watching anyone be sick.}
<A>__{rose rose lies down on her bed with the curtain open. there is something familiar about the way homer approaches her bedside; he does so with the authority of a doctor. he sits on the edge of her bed with such complete self assurance that she doesn't protest.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{how many months are you?}
<A>__{she just stares. but she doesn't stop him when he touches her abdomen. it's as if she knows that he knows what he's doing.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{you're not yet three months, are you?}
<C>__{rose rose}
<D>__{not yet. what do you know about it?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{i know more than i want to know about it. who's the father?}
<C>__{rose rose}
<D>__{don't trouble yourself about it, homer this ain't your business.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{but you don't look very happy.}
<C>__{rose rose}
<D>__{happy! what are you thinkin'? how am i supposed to take care of a baby! i can't have a baby.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{rose, please listen. whatever you want to do, i can help you.}
<A>__{she is taken back.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{what i mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, i know a place where you can go.}
<C>__{rose rose}
<D>__{you think daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? i ain't going nowhere.}
<A>__{she rolls over on the bed, facing away from him again.}
<C>__{rose rose}
<D>__{why don't you just go back to your pickin', homer? i can take care of it myself!}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{rose, listen don't do anything. you know, i mean to yourself. please listen...}
