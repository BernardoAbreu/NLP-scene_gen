<L>__{interior black cat pool club night}
<A>__{the lights are low and only the glow of the jukebox and the sounds of harold melvin and the bluenotes as mack and his manicurist get down on the pooltable, beside an ornate mirror laden with two gold '45s and an ounce of cocaine. which they are both doing to excess. mack's wearing nothing but a black hat and black satin briefs (not a pretty sight). working now on her blouse.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{bones, my ass.}
<P>__{(sings while unbuttoning the manicurist's blouse)}
<D>__{"...if you don't believe he's laid to rest you count the holes in his motherfucking chest..."}
<A>__{she laughs and gets up.}
<C>__{coke whore}
<D>__{that tickles. i want to hear that again.}
<A>__{he watches her sashay to the other room where the juke box is. then bends over the mirror to do a new line. from the other room, the song changes. a deep menacing rolling funk number.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{that's it, baby. gimme the rolling bass and i will tickle your tweeter all night long...}
