<A>__{they come to the bottom of the steps giggling and jabbing each other. once off the stairs they instantly transform as though hit with cold air. they assume a cool, professional exterior and walk two feet apart. one would look at them and see only two business associates here to ply their trade. they walk across the dimly lit dining room to a table in the far corner where two men are already waiting. the first is mr. fortier, age thirty five, the other is mr. renault, age sixty. both men are impeccably dressed with a distinguished air. they stand and smile.}
