<A>__{luke peers over the dumpster, down at his breasts, with a high fever, and passes out, slumping to the ground. behind the dumpster late night luke's eyes open, dilated, disoriented. he's lying on the ground, shirtless among bits of garbage. he watches bleary eyed, as a mouse peers at him from inside an empty milk carton. the mouse runs over and sniffs at a canteloupe, which triggers luke's memory: he grabs his chest, relieved to find it's back to normal. he stands, dizzy, surveying the dark, locked restaurant, and staggers across the deserted parking lot toward his truck.}
