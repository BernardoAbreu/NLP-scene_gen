<A>__{drew turns on her heel and exits. when parker sets her blackberry down we get our first glimpse of... ... her side of the bathroom which resembles a post apocalyptic toiletry landscape. there's a very clear line of demarcation on the counter like the demilitarized zone separating the koreas. parker reaches among the rubble for her toothbrush but notices another message on her blackberry: thoreau 786: know what today is? notatwin: another day in hell? thoreau 786: two weeks since our first chat. notatwin: our anniversary. how sweet. thoreau 786: since it's a special occasion, my real name's warren collier. if you're ever in the city, i'd}
