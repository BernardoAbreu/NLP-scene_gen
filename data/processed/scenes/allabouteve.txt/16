<L>__{interior margo's dressing room night}
<A>__{it's undergone quite a change. a new carpet, chintz covers for the furniture, new lampshades, dainty curtains across the filthy barred window. birdie waits within. she's listening to a fight; she shuts it off as they enter.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(entering)}
<D>__{you bought the new girdles a size smaller. i can feel it.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{something maybe grew a size bigger.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{when we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{i couldn't get into the girdle in two an' a half hours...}
<A>__{margo's out of her wig and dress by now. she gets into her robe, sits at the dressing table. eve's on the chaise, by the discarded costume.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{you haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(turns, looks)}
<D>__{well, you've done so much... what's new?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{the curtains. i made them myself.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{they are lovely. aren't they lovely, birdie?}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{adorable. we now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{just because you can't even work a zipper. it was very thoughtful, eve, and i appreciate it }
<A>__{a pause. eve rises, picking up margo's costume.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{while you're cleaning up, i will take this to the wardrobe mistress }
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{don't bother. mrs. brown'll be along for it in a minute.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{no trouble at all.}
<A>__{and she goes out with the costume. birdie opens her mouth, shuts it, then opens it again.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{if i may so bold as to say something did you ever hear the word "union"?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{behind in your dues? how much?}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{i haven't got a union. i'm slave labor.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{but the wardrobe women have got one. and next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business }
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(catching on)}
<D>__{oh oh.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{she's got two things to do carry clothes an' press 'em wrong an' just let anybody else muscle in...}
<A>__{as she talks, margo hurries to the door and out after eve.}
