<A>__{they walk in the quiet house and turn on the light, as little spider monkeys in a cage jump toward them and screech. rebecca and marc jump back, he yells. rebecca glares at him to be cool.}

<D>__{oh my fucking god.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{they're her pet monkeys. hi guys.}
<A>__{she leans forward and makes a cute face at the monkey who hisses at her. they continue through the house looking around. they pass a gilded gold framed couch with pillows with paris' photo silk screened on them. they pass a wall of photos of paris hilton and her many magazine covers, as they go upstairs. marc is nervous, rebecca is cool and focused. he paces and is on the look out, while she looks for stuff.}

<D>__{it's fine, it's fine...let's keep going.}

<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{you're tripping out. this is fine, it's ok, why are you tripping out?}
<A>__{rebecca casually descends the stairs as if she lives there. marc follows her down, into paris' night club room. there are pictures of her all over the walls, and a stripper pole on a little platform. pink furry pillows line the banquette. marc takes a bottle of vodka. rebecca looks around the room, takes it all in.}
