<L>__{exterior the coslaw driveway, with marty and uncle al}
<C>__{uncle al}
<D>__{now i said i had something for you, as i believe you will recall.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{yeah! what is it?}
<A>__{al unlocks the trunk of his car and brings out a paper shopping bag. he places the bag in marty's lap. marty opens the bag, but it's really too dark to see inside. he reaches in and brings out a handful of assorted fireworks crackers, roman candles, twizzers, smoke bombs, etc. an expression of sublime delight fills marty's face as he inventories these goodies.}
<C>__{uncle al}
<D>__{you're gonna have the fourth of july in october, marty. just don't blow your head off. (pause) and remember that it isn't just the fireworks. it's because no crazy shithead should be able to stop the good guys, if you can dig that.}
<C>__{marty }
<D>__{i can dig it thank you, uncle al! thank you!}
<C>__{uncle al}
<D>__{stay near the house, for christ's sake someone's killing people. i have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{yeah, i know. it's great!}
<C>__{uncle al}
<D>__{one of the reasons i love you, marty, is that you're almost as crazy as i am. please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? just bright colors. can you tell the difference?}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{yeah... sure.}
<C>__{uncle al}
<D>__{save this one for last.}
<A>__{he brings out a short rocket with stubby vanes on the end. a fat fuse sticks out behind the head.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{uncle al}
<D>__{a tracer. you'll like it.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{thanks a million, uncle al!}
<C>__{uncle al}
<D>__{you're welcome a million, marty. stick 'em in the bushes for now.}
<A>__{marty motors over to the side of the garage, where there's a line of bushes, and conceals the bag in them. uncle al gets in his car and starts it up. marty comes back.}
<C>__{uncle al }
<D>__{have a good time, dear boy! and watch out for the werewolves!}
<A>__{he leaves. marty sits in his wheelchair, waving.}
