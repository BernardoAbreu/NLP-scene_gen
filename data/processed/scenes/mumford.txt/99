<D>__{...mickey mumford was in miss rice's kindergarten class with me. he was killed with his parents in a wreck on their way back from a steelers game. he was only six years old, which is a real plus, so there's a birth certificate if anyone checks but not much else. they died in pennsylvania, so there's no death certificate in west virginia... that's also good.}
<A>__{on a kitchen table, the new birth certificate, now filled out for michael mumford, is carefully lifted from a shallow bowl of light tea (the tea bags are nearby). the paper has taken on an aged, sepia look. cut to: a stack of books. the ones on top are lifted away. the bottom book is opened to reveal the birth certificate. it has been folded in an official way. now mumford unfolds it, then refolds it differently with its smudges and creases, it's starting to look old.}

<D>__{and a birth certificate is enough?}

<D>__{everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.}
