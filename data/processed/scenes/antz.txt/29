<L>__{interior mega tunnel day}
<A>__{the mass of worker ants are swinging pick axes in the tunnel. the foreman moves up the line, berating the workers, yelling at them to dig faster.}
<C>__{azteca}
<D>__{i tell ya, i'm gettin' sick of bein' yelled at. worker #1 what do you want, we're just workers.}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{you know, you're not just workers you can be whatever you want to be! look at z! he started as a worker then he became a soldier!}
<C>__{azteca}
<D>__{that's right! he slaughtered hundreds of termites single handedly! worker #2 i heard about this guy.}
<P>__{(turning to the other workers)}
<D>__{he crashed a party at the palace. then he took a hike with one of the royal babes! and when they tried to stop him, he just looked at a couple'a guards, and they burst into flames! worker ant #1 you're nuts, how could a worker do all that?}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, azteca...}
<C>__{azteca}
<D>__{invisible!}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{no an individual! worker #2 what's that?}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{well, it's...someone with his own point of view...someone who does what he wants, not whatever he's told to do!}
<C>__{azteca}
<P>__{(eyes lit up, watching weaver)}
<D>__{someone who follows his heart!}
<C>__{weaver}
<P>__{(taking azteca's hand)}
<D>__{right...because every ant's important! worker #2}
<P>__{(scoffs)}
<D>__{but that would mean i'm important. worker #1 i'm outta here, this sounds like trouble to me.}
<A>__{but more ants are gathering 'round.}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{we can all be individuals! just like z!}
<A>__{weaver and azteca hold hands. more ants are gathering around, dropping their tools...}
