<L>__{interior ben's office day}
<A>__{ben is with a patient, carl anderson, a high strung milquetoast in his late forties.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{carl, i'm detecting a pattern here. you seem to settle too easily for things.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you're right. i do.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no, well, there you go. you just did it again. i suggested something and you immediately agreed.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you're right. i did.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{why do you think you do that?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well, sometimes people do it because they fear rejection or disapproval, but you can't let that worry you, carl. and you can't agree with things just for the sake of agreeing. stand your ground. don't let people roll over you.}
<A>__{the door opens and jelly enters.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{dr. sobol?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{excuse me! i'm in a session here.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{yeah, i know, i'm sorry.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you're... you're one of the guys i rear ended the other night.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{bingo.}
<P>__{(to carl)}
<D>__{get outta here.}
<A>__{jelly takes carl by the elbow and lifts him off the couch.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{upsa daisy. you got a coat, nutbar?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{he's leaving.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{the hell he is. he's not going anywhere until we're done with his session.}
<A>__{jelly pulls a big roll of bills out of his pocket, removes the rubber band, and peels off a couple of fifties.}
<C>__{jelly}
<P>__{(to carl)}
<D>__{i will give you a hundred bucks to get out of here.}
<A>__{carl looks at the money, then he gives ben a plaintive look.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{don't take it, carl.}
<A>__{carl looks back to jelly.}
<C>__{jelly}
<P>__{(peeling off another bill)}
<D>__{a hundred and fifty.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{he's not leaving.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(trembling)}
<D>__{three hundred.}
<C>__{jelly}
<P>__{(pays him)}
<D>__{you're not that fuckin' crazy.}
<A>__{carl takes the money, gives ben the thumbs up and exits. jelly follows him to the door and waves for someone to come in.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{listen, if you're upset about your car, i can understand that. but you don't just barge in here }
<A>__{paul vitti steps into the office. ben freezes. jelly crosses to take vitti's coat.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{you know who i am?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{no you don't.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{you've seen my picture in the papers?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{yes. and no. sometimes. never.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{jelly, wait outside.}
<A>__{jelly exits. vitti walks around the room, taking everything in. he picks up the phone and listens. hangs up.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{sit down.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{ben sits quickly on the coffee table. he crushes a box of tissues, then moves them out from under his ass. vitti picks up a stack of cds and looks through them.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{tony bennett, huh?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{yeah. he's my favorite.}
<A>__{vitti picks up an autographed baseball bat from ben's desk.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(puts up his hands)}
<D>__{mr. vitti, i tried to give the guy my insurance information, but he wouldn't take it. seriously, i tried several times because it was all my please don't kill me.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{i was just gonna ask if you liked baseball.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{yes. big yankee fan.}
<A>__{vitti puts the bat down.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{mr. vitti. not that it's your fault, but your friend, he interrupted a patient's session and that's not good. i think this is a matter for our insurance companies, don't you think?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{i don't care about the car.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{then what ?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{a friend of mine is having a problem and he might have to see a shrink, so i'm going to ask you a couple questions. do we sit?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{whatever makes you comfortable.}
<A>__{ben starts for his chair, but vitti sits in it first. ben sits on the couch. vitti adjusts the cuffs of his shirt, and runs a hand down the crease in his slacks.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{okay, the first thing i gotta know about is privacy. you must hear a lot of weird shit in here. how do i know you won't go testifying not testifying but, you know, talking about it to somebody else.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i won't discuss a patient with anyone for any reason, unless i know the patient may be a danger to himself. like if i'm concerned a patient might kill himself...}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{not fuckin' likely }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{ or kill someone else.}
<A>__{ben looks to vitti for a response. vitti stares at him for a long, uncomfortable beat.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{so who starts?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{why don't you tell me why you think you need therapy?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{i don't need therapy. i'm helping out my friend. you didn't hear me say that?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{right. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{you guys are supposed to be so great when it comes to listening. you can't remember what i said two seconds ago.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm very sorry.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{i have to tell you, doc, i'm not thrilled with the level of service up to this pointerior}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{why don't you tell me about your friend?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{he's a powerful guy. never had a problem dealing with things, you know? now all of a sudden, he's falling apart. he cries for no reason. he's having trouble sleeping. and then he started having these attacks. you know, can't breathe, dizzy, chest pains like you think you're gonna die.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{panic attacks.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{what's with all you doctors and the fuckin' panic? did i say panic?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{not panic. dizzy breathing chest pain attacks.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{right. so the question is, what can he do to make it stop?}
<A>__{ben decides to go for it.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm going to go out on a limb here. i think your friend is you.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{you you you you have a gift, my friend. go on.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{medication could help, but if you really want to get to the bottom of this, you're going to want to get some kind of therapy.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{with you?}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(hedging)}
<D>__{with me? oh, i don't know. i'd have to look at my schedule. i'm very heavily booked right now and i'm going on a short vacation tomorrow.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{where you going?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i don't really share that information with...}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{miami beach.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{you know, this could be good. just getting that off my chest, i feel better already. it's like a load is off my shoulders. thank you.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well, i really didn't do anything }
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{you did something. the load? off. where is it? don't know. you're good, doctor. i will be in touch. but listen to me.}
<P>__{(leaning close, menacing)}
<D>__{if i talk to you and it turns me into a fag, i will kill you. you understand?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{could we define 'fag,' because some feelings may come up }
<A>__{vitti silences him with a wave of his hand.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{i go fag, you die. got it?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{vitti gives ben a little pat on the cheek, then turns and exits. ben is stunned.}
