<A>__{chet leads a jumpy will into}
<L>__{interior empty classroom, junior high school day}
<A>__{chet shuts the door behind them. will paces.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{you wanna apologize, don't you? you look like shit. you've probably been up for days thinking about what an asshole you were. well, it's gonna take a lot more than some pathetic groveling }
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{chet! shut up! i don't wanna apologize to you!}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{then what do you want? because we don't have anything left to say to each other.}
<A>__{will swallows hard.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{here goes. and this is gonna sound crazy. because it is fucking crazy. but last night two guys in masks jumped me and strapped a bomb to my chest, and now i have less than eight hours to rob a bank.}
<A>__{chet just stares at will, unimpressed.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{you're hysterical. got me. great joke. i'm going back to work now.}
<A>__{will steps in chet's way. he unbuttons his jacket, revealing the bomb.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{what the fuck? is that real?}
<A>__{will nods. chet jumps backward, stumbles over a desk and scurries on his ass to the other end of the classroom. he presses himself flat against the wall.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{stay away from me! what the fuck are you involved in!? terrorism!?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{chet, do you really think i'm a terrorist?}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{yes! one of the dumb ones! the ones they convince to wear the bombs!}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i am not fucking around here. two guys did this to me. and if i don't rob that bank in time this thing is gonna blow.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{seriously?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{seriously.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{and your first idea was to come to a school filled with young children?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i didn't }
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{just back the fuck away from me with that thing.}
<A>__{will backs all the way up, so that the guys are on opposite ends of the classroom.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{listen, i think the vest is safe for now. these guys don't want me to blow myself up on accident before i get their money.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{oh, so you figure the two psychopaths that rigged a bomb to your chest made sure it was safe? there's no margin for error in their fucking bomb vest design!?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i don't know! all i do know is that this is real. this is happening. and i'm sure you hate me as much as i hate you right now, but i have nowhere else to go.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{for help, chet. i need your help. please. i can't do this alone.}
<A>__{chet looks will over. his desperation is palpable. chet bites his lip, weighing the situation...}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{damn it!}
<P>__{(takes a breath)}
<D>__{i'd like to tell you to get fucked, but you know what the problem is...i'm a better man than you. and someday, i might actually forgive you. so if i let you blow up, or whatever, that shit might come back and eat at my conscience, and totally affect my relationships with other people. like my wife and kids and shit.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that's a...very rational way to look at the situation.}
<P>__{(genuinely)}
<D>__{and you're right, about being a better guy than me.}
<A>__{chet takes a step toward will.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{are you sure that thing isn't gonna blow at any second?}
<A>__{will just looks at chet...unable to offer any assurance. after a beat }
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{could you just walk a few feet in front of me for a while?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i can do that.}
<A>__{will opens the door, stops, looks back at chet.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{will heads out. chet takes a breath, bracing himself.}
