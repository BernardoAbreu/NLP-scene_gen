<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{why else do you think we were assigned to her, if not to find the killer? protection is a job for local security... not jedi. it's overkill, master. investigation is implied in our mandate. obi wan we will do as the council has instructed, and you will learn your place, young one.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{perhaps with merely your presence, the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed. now if you will excuse me i will retire.}

<D>__{i ain't seen one of these since i was prospecting on subterrel beyond the outer rim! obi wan do you know where it came from?}
<A>__{dexter grins. he puts the dart down between them.}
<C>__{dexter jettster}
<D>__{this baby belongs to them cloners. what you got here is a kamino kyberdart. obi wan kamino kyberdart... i wonder why it didn't show up in any analysis archive.}
<C>__{dexter jettster}
<D>__{it's these funny little cuts on the side give it away... those analysis droids you've got over there only focus on symbols, you know. i should think you jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom. obi wan well, dex, if droids could think, we wouldn't be here, would we?}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{kamino... doesn't sound familiar. is it part of the republic?}
<C>__{dexter jettster}
<D>__{no, it's beyond the outer rim. i'd say about twelve parsecs outside the rishi maze, toward the south. it should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archive to find. those kaminoans keep to themselves. they're cloners. damned good ones, too.}
<A>__{obi wan then picks up the dart, holding it midway between them.}

<D>__{i doubt that.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{no, really. when i started my training, i was very homesick and very lonely. this city and my mom were the only pleasant things i had to think about... the problem was, the more i thought about my mom, the worse i felt. but i would feel better if i thought about the palace the way it shimmers in the sunlight the way the air always smells of flowers...}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{...and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls. the first time i saw the capital, i was very young... i'd never seen a waterfall before. i though they were so beautiful... i never dreamed one day i'd live in the palace.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl?}
<C>__{padme}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{no! that was the last thing i thought of. my dream was to help in the "refugee relief movement." i never thought of running for elected office. but the more history i studied, the more i realised how much good politicians could do. so when i was eight, i joined the "apprentice legislators", then later on became a senatorial advisor, with such a passion that, before i knew it, i was elected queen. partly because i scored so high on my education certificate, but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible. i wasn't the youngest queen ever elected, but now that i think back on it, i'm not sure i was old enough. i'm not sure i was ready.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{the people you served thought you did a good job. i heard they tried to amend the constitution so you could stay in office.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{popular rule is not democracy, annie. it gives the people what they want, not what they need. and, truthfully, i was relieved when my two terms were up. so were my parents. they worried about me during the blockade and couldn't wait for it all to be over. actually, i was hoping to have a family by now... my sisters have the most amazing, wonderful kids... but when the queen asked me to serve as senator, i couldn't refuse her.}

<C>__{queen jamillia}
<D>__{how many systems have joined count dooku and the separatists?}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{about two hundred. and more are leaving the republic every day. if the senate votes to create an army, i'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war.}
<C>__{sio bibble}
<D>__{it's unthinkable! there hasn't been a full scale war since the formation of the republic!}
<C>__{queen jamillia}
<D>__{do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the republic?}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{not if they feel threatened. the separatists don't have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. i'm sure of that. and with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the commerce guilds or the trade federation for help.}
<C>__{queen jamillia}
<D>__{the armies of commerce! why has nothing been done in the senate to restrain them?}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i'm afraid that, despite the chancellor's best efforts, there are still many bureaucrats, judges, and even senators on the payrolls of the guilds.}
<C>__{sio bibble}
<D>__{it's outrageous! after all of those hearings, and the four trials in the supreme court, nute gunray is still the viceroy of the trade federation. do those money mongers control everything?}

<C>__{padme}

<P>__{(continuing}
<D>__{he was always striving to become a more powerful jedi. he wanted to be the best. with a lightsaber, in the old style of fencing, he had no match. his knowledge of the force was... unique. in the end, i think he left because he lost faith in the republic. he believed that politics were corrupt, and he felt the jedi betrayed themselves by serving the politicians. he always had very high expectations of government. he disappeared for nine or ten years, then he just showed up recently as the head of the separatist movement. obi wan interesting... i'm still not sure i understand.}
